# OOG Credit Bureau

OOG Credit Bureau is a public data collection agency that consolidates information on borrowers and provides it to potential lenders.

Submitting information on your borrowers is optional, but if you use this data in making credit-worthyness evaluations, please consider adding your information.

The primary goal of this project is to centralize information about borrowers, so lenders are aware of how many loans a borrower may have. You may report various types of lending:

* Loans (made through the in-game loan contract system)
* Advances (individual advance purchases of goods)
* Sponsored Bases (Lenders supply significant base materials for promise of ongoing future products)
* Purchase Advances (Borrower recieves goods now, then pays later)

In instances of creative lending, record the value of whatever was lended, and the start date. For example, if you are providing a sponsored IDC base, calculate the sum of the base cost and consumables.

The sheet is public for editing, and the Google Docs version history feature will record all changes.
