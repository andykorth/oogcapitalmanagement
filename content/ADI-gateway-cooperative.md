# ADI Gateway Cooperative

The ADI Gateway cooperative is a regional organization dedicated to the construction and operation of a gateway network. The cooperative allows for a shared-ownership model for the gateways developed under the program. Ownership of the gateway network is proportional to the contributions by the member, using the co-op price list.

{{< focusedtext heading="Rules of the Cooperative" >}}

* Anyone in ANT who wants to join the co-op is welcome.
* We track the contributions, and each contributing member has a percentage of the gateway assigned to them. So you're sort of a partial owner of the gateway.
* The co-op maintains a sheet tracking contributed materials, and also "planned materials"- materials intended to be contributed, in an effort to avoid accidentally making too many of a particular gateway material.
* Gateway income (from transit fees), are distributed propotionally according to shares.
* Each member agrees to uphold these rules of the co-op if they are elected governor.
* All members agree to ensure someone in the co-op in the co-op maintains governorship of the gateway planet. They may pick a candidate of their own choice from the co-op, as long as it ensures a co-op member wins.
* All members agree to facilitate (personally or through a representative) operation, fueling, and distribution of gateway profits according to these rules.

Since we need to make at least two gateways for this thing to do anything, we should pool contributions for all the gateways constructed under the program, to minimize complexity in distributions later.

Why use this model? At the moment, any gateway constructed falls under the control of the government of the planet it is build around. A hostile but coordinated group could seize the gateway from the group that constructed it. By bringing many shareholders to the table, the co-op model incentivizes the good behavior of a large number of members. This allows the entire interested Antares community to participate and act as a self-interested voting block. 

# Questions

### Can I join without contributing?

Absolutely. Your support is still very helpful in maintaining the ADI Gateway Cooperative agreement, and the safe administration of the gateways.

### Can I contribute cash?

Yes. The best way to contribute cash is to find a player (preferably a new Antares player!), and purchase needed gateway materials from that player, then donate materials in their name.

If this process is burdensome, contact a gateway cooperative administrator to facilitate your cash contribution.

### How do payouts work?

Once a month, the gateway planet's governor, (or an appointed representative) will calculate how much income each gateway has made, then assign it to each gateway shareholder in proportion to the number of shares. Shareholder profits will be logged in a running ledger. If a person's assigned profit exceeds some threshold ($25,000?), a payout will be made. 

### Survivorship of Shares

If a co-op shareholder leaves the game, their shares will move to their designated survivor. If they have not mentioned one, or their choice is not available, it will move to their corp. If no corp representative is available, the shares are eliminated and everyone's shares are recalculated without the eliminated shares included.
