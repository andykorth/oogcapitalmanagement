Gateways are coming, and Antares will be ready for them!

## Key Points We Know: 

* A planetary government can commission one gateway in orbit. They administer that gateway.
* Ships without FTL drives can take gateways.
* Ships jump from a source gateway to a destination gateway that is in range. (and connected to by the gateway administrator..?)
* Ships take time to travel through a gateway, balanced to be similar to an FTL jump.
* Gateways have limits on ships per day, distance the gateway can reach, the volume of ships that can fly through it, and the fuel that is used. 
* Gateways need to be refueled occasionally, the fuel will be a new material and recipe.

I suspect any gateway can recieve ships, even if it doesn't match the requirements to send a ship back through. This can be a feature, enabling triangular paths of gates, but can be a disadvantage if you accidentally strand a STL ship.

* Gateways max out with 3 distance upgrades, and 5 upgrades total.

### The default gateway stats:

![Draft Gateway Stats ](/images/gateway-choices.png)

We have potentially non-final stats for the starting un-upgraded gateway. Observations about these values:

* 200 jumps per day starting value- in my estimation this is a lot of jumps.
* 1500 max ship volume. This fits a starter ship (963 m3), a WCB (1488 m3), but not a standard 2k (2675m). We don't know how much space is added per size upgrade.
* Distance starts at 10 parsecs and with 3 upgrades goes to a max of 25 parsecs.
* We don't know about fuel consumption rates.

## How far is 25 Parsecs?

OOG has a [specially refitted version of Taiyi's map](https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/map/) that can calculate gateway distances. Since it's hard to visualize actual distances in any of the maps, tools are essential for pre-planning gateway routes.

Phobos to Griffonstone is 15.1 parsecs. This also gets you towards the Northern Antares CX.

Sometimes 20 parsecs can save quite a few jumps:

We have additional python tools that can brute force jump distances.

## Gateway Jumper

The shipyard engineers of OOG have designed the Gateway Jumper. At internal prices, this could be as low as 2m AIC with a 1000/1000 cargo bay.

## Gateway cost

Costs have been well covered in discussion on discord. We now have a pretty solid look at the materials for each upgrade cost. It seems the two distance upgrades adds a few hundred of each afab and 240 LIT. We don't know the cost of the new materials, but since it doesn't add TSH/RSH/PSH, it's pretty cheap, proportionally.

Based on my work with the map distances, I think increased distance is a must-have upgrade. Every time you add 5 parsecs, you drastically increase the area under the gateway's circle, and the number of systems you could reach. 

## Antares Gateway Planning

Te Antares Development Initiative is organizing gateway planning in the best region of space in the universe. It's important to consider both sides of a gateway in planning, the reusability of a gateway as a destination for multiple gateways, and the cost per jump saved, given the upgrades chosen.
