# Press Release

_Directorate for Strategic Expansion of OOG Capital Management_

#### OOG Headquarters on Nike

#### October 30, 3025

---

In a landmark achievement that redefines the boundaries of physics, finance, and sheer audacity, OOG Capital Management has unveiled the universe's first operational Vortex Engine — a propulsion technology capable of bending spacetime, collapsing distance, and turning once-impossible dreams into viable trade routes.

For centuries, explorers have gazed beyond the edge of the universe and wondered what lay in the silent dark between the stars. Now, that dark will have traffic.

Developed in partnership across OOG, the Vortex Engine represents the culmination of years of investment, speculation, and perfectly-timed arbitrage. Fueled by ambition and a modest quantity of krypton gas, it allows ships to leap freely between systems without reliance on existing jump pathways or gateways. In practical terms: the universe just got smaller — and OOG's reach just got infinite.

When asked for a quote, an Hephaestus engineer under OOG 'employment' responded, “Thanks to this new Vortex Engine, we will no longer moving through space... We'll be moving through _opportunity_.”

OOG, the oldest and largest active corporation in Antares space, has long been synonymous with stability, governance, and galactic-scale enterprise. Founded in 3021, the organization now governs over one million citizens across dozens of planets, overseeing sectors of finance, construction, and regional development.

Early production models of the Vortex Engine are enroute to Hecate to power the new Colony Ship class, enabling interstellar expansion beyond the mapped clusters. 

“OOG was built on the principle that prosperity is not a zero-sum game,” said a Phobos scientist working in a OOG Research Council lab. “Now, prosperity itself can travel faster than light.”

Do you want to be a part of universe leading organization like OOG? We're always looking for new members.  We seek team players based in ANT space — governors, gateway engineers, and visionaries alike — who want to help shape the next chapter of interstellar prosperity. The engines are warm, the stars are open, and [OOG is recruiting](/joining/).
