# The Naming of Planets and Systems in Antares
{{< /center >}}

## A History:

Antares has a rich history of naming systems and planets. With our uniquely organized, intelligent, and cooperative playerbase, we have the most consistent naming themes in the universe.

Many of the planets in Antares are named after Greek gods or other concepts. Some of the most notable choices include Phobos and Deimos, starter planets in Antares and twin brothers of fear and terror, respectively. Thalassa is the divine personification of the sea, and a fitting place for Ice Station Alpha, one of the best water extraction planets in the galaxy. Demeter is a goddess of harmony and concord, associated with agriculture- and the most fertile planet in Antares space. Harmonia, an agricultural starting planet, is named after the goddess of harmony.

In Antares I, we also have Eos, the electronics planet closest to the sun which is named after the god of the dawn. Nearby we have Hephaestus- a manufacturing and ship building powerhouse, named after the god of the forge. Astraeus is named after the titan god of dusk, stars, and astrology, father of the winds.

In Antares II, we have more recently named planets like Vulcan, the second metallurgy planet that supplements Deimos. Together they ensure Antares dominance in aluminum production and ship components.

Hekaton is named after Hekatompylos, the city of one thousand gates. It's placed in the system Styx. The names are perfect for the host of our [Gateway project](/ADI-gateway-cooperative/). And the recently named Agamemnon is a valuable chemistry planet, named after the mythological king of Mycenae.

There are also a few planets in Antares where the Greek ties are a bit harder to uncover. The planet "Bober" is actually a mistranslation of "Boubón" (or βουβών). The Greek word boubón means "groin" or "swelling". We aren't sure why this name was chosen, but perhaps it reflects the Chemistry COGC on the planet. The system Aurum is a reference to the excellent gold resources in the system. Technically it's latin and not greek, but it's not the [biggest naming mistake in the system](https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/lore/shortstories/elons_musk/index.html).

If you're considering naming a planet or system, take a look at a [list of Greek mythological figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greek_mythological_figures)!
