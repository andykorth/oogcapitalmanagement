The ADI Gateway Cooperative is an Antares-based regional group focused on constructing gateways. By contributing resources to the gateways, members earn ownership shares proportional to their contributions. By banding together, [co-op members ensure the smooth operation of gateways](/adi-gateway-cooperative/) in Antares and beyond!

## What's still needed?

You can still help out! If you have ASMs on Vulcan or Deimos, you can help refine RE-based alloys for a stipend that covers your costs. Contact Archiel with your ASM count on each planet. 

Additionally, we're still looking for more GWS. If it's too much to make a whole GWS, you can contribute just some subcomponents.
* PFG production mostly requires ECA products, and requires no Rhenium.
* SDM production is mostly TRS, made in PP4s. 
* TRS is also still needed!
