The first step to being a good governor, is understanding the population infrastructure mechanics on your planet. Here are some resources:

* [Archiel's Good Governance Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDvP3Iz-MDIa_uoQPsJDDOHn72dK7T02k1oAa94K2W0) - A starting place to understanding how to run a planet.
* [Archiel's Governor Helper](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19mg6DKaGi_cfjLNyb8AeS00oddgMbepTDf9RIkOMocw) - A spreadsheet that helps calculate upkeep resources and project population changes.
* [FIO Wiki](https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/) - The math behind population infrastructure, for when you _really_ want to understand it.
