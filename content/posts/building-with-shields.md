## Optimizing Ship Construction with Shields in Prosperous Universe

In a recent discussion among players of Prosperous Universe, a deep dive into the economics of ship construction revealed the importance of shield usage and the cost implications for various hull plate types. Here's a summary of the key points.
Efficiency of Advanced Hull Plates (AHP)

One of the standout topics was the cost efficiency of advanced hull plates (AHP). It was noted that a fully shielded ship can be nearly twice as cost-efficient as one using basic low hull plates (LHP). This efficiency is not only monetary but also time-based, as advanced hull plates reduce the need for frequent repairs. Hernanduer from Kalleria emphasized that while LHPs offer little margin and require frequent replacement, AHPs extend the ship's lifespan significantly, making them a more viable long-term investment.

## Market Dynamics and Production Costs

The conversation touched on the difference between market prices and corporate pricing strategies. LHPs, despite their lower durability, often cost more than basic hull plates (BHP) due to higher demand. The production costs for various hull plates were shared:

    SRP: 4700/u
    APT: 3800/u
    AWH: 5600/u
    AHP: 4100/u
    HHP: 3400/u
    RHP: 3300/u

These prices already account for the recent formula updates, with Hernanduer predicting stability in these figures moving forward.
The Shield Factor

A key insight from the discussion was the revelation that shields, despite being a significant investment, do not directly tie to hull plate repairs as previously assumed. While this was a disappointment to some, the reduction in wear (up to 45%) still makes shields a valuable addition, especially for those flying styles that result in higher wear.

## Strategic Takeaways

Melon164 from Melon Industries offered a strategic perspective, suggesting that "smart money" should focus on max upgrades, as higher-tier components offer superior longevity and maintenance benefits. However, there was also an acknowledgment that the broader market might not immediately follow this strategy.

Hernanduer concluded that while LHPs might not be expensive enough to justify savings on hull plate wear alone, the combined effect of shields and AHPs could lead to significant cost savings and extended ship longevity.
Final Thoughts

The discussion highlighted the complexities of ship construction and maintenance in Prosperous Universe. Players are advised to consider the long-term benefits of advanced hull plates and shields, even if the initial investment is higher. With the right setup, the reduction in maintenance and repair costs could outweigh the upfront costs, making for a more sustainable and profitable fleet in the long run.
