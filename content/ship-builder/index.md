This tool shows the current stock Archiel's inventory for [OOG Premium Shipbuilding](/shipbuilding/). Current stock is pulled from FIO, but be mindful that the information may be a few hours out of date, or there may be pending sale contracts. Ships are delivered on Heph, but the tool also shows stock on ANT. If a ship of one type is purchased, others may become unavailable. Contact Archiel on discord to purchase.
