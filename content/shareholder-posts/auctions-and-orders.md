## Introduction
We are the premier corporation in Antares space and the largest governance organisation in the universe. As a corporation, we work to ensure the stability of the Antares region, as well as creating a fun and engaging place for our members to enjoy the Prosperous Universe. 

Our corporation includes governance training and support, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities, including base teleports. Our friendly group has members that are active in all timezones.

### Corp Rules
* Continue to be an active contributing member of OOG.
* Willingness to aid in corp expansion goals.
* Leave the in-game corporation if you decide to stop playing.

### Onboarding Steps


1. Say hello in the [#general channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/854795108720443395).
2. Update the [Corp Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=0) with your company details.
    1. Add your [planets to the planets tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=0). 
        1. Add your company details at the end of the sheet in column A. Your user, company name, then company code.
        2. For each planet on which you have a base, find the associated column, and enter the number of each production building. Highlight any production buildings at the end of longer production chains in red.
    2. Add any goods you wish to sell via the internal corp market to the Prices tab. _See more details for how this works in [Selling Goods](#selling-goods).


## Trial Member Process

We have a 7 day trial period for all players interested in joining OOG. During this period, you have access to everything within the corp except corporate dividend payments. During your 7 day trial, feel free to ask questions, explore the Discord, and get to know us as a corp. We will do the same getting to know you as a player. After your 7 day trial is up, if we are a good match for each other, you will receive an official invite to the corporation in game.


# Internal Market

The corporation operates an internal market for goods, offering preferential prices to trial and shareholding members. You can find the current prices for goods in the [Corp Google Sheet, on the Prices tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022).


## Selling Goods


### Price Listing

If you wish to sell goods within the corp then you are encouraged to add these to the [Prices tab in the Corp Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022). If you have not already, add your user & company details as a new section prior to the ‚ÄúInactive / Retired Players‚Äù row. 

_Tip: If you want your name to appear when members search for goods, you need to make sure that every row relevant for your corp has your username in column B (this is hidden most of the time by shrinking it to 5px wide column, so can be missed easily). _

For example (in rows 136-139, columns A-D):

| Akyan | Akyan |  |  EPO @ 140 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Ingenious Innovations Inc | Akyan |  |  NR @ 350 |
| III | Akyan |  | C @ 500  | 
|     | Akyan |  | H @ 70   |

The listing of goods enables all corp members to:

* Price up expansion efforts by utilizing goods offered at discounted prices by members.
* Understand what goods are manufactured by other members, and enable decisions about how they might expand their manufacturing. Redundancy is generally good, so don‚Äôt be put off if a good is already offered by other members.


### Goods Auction

If you have stock you wish to sell then use the [#auction channel on discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755). You can use the /auction bot command to initiate a sale. The auction allows corp members to bid for a quantity of the stock you make available at the price you choose, when you finish the auction it‚Äôll automatically split fairly the amount available amongst all those who‚Äôve bid.


1. Open the [#auction channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755).
2. Type /auction and hit space
3. Enter the fields for the bot command
    1. Location - Where you wish the purchaser to collect the goods.
    2. Price
    3. Amount - The quantity of the good available for sale
    4. Item - The code for the goods. _For example, EPO for Epoxy Resin._
    5. Currency - e.g. AIC

	_It‚Äôll look something like this: \
_

4. Hit enter. 
5. Your goods will then automatically be posted to the #auction channel for members to bid on.  \
_It‚Äôll look something like this once you have bids:_

![alt_text](image2.png)


6. When you‚Äôre ready to complete the auction, at a time of your choosing, you can click the finish button. _The bot will then update the message to reflect who should receive the contracts_
7. Send the contracts to the successful bidders to receive the goods.
8. Fin.


### Fulfilling Orders

The members of the corp will post their own auctions in the #auctions channel, which you can choose to fulfil.

If you wish to sell any of your goods to them at the price & location they‚Äôve specified, feel free to offer by clicking on the fulfil all, or fulfil some buttons on order messages posted by the bot.

![alt_text](image3.png)

The bot will then automatically update the order to state that you‚Äôre fulfilling some or all of the order. Once registered, feel free to send a contract to the other member, if not already sent by them.


## Buying Goods


### Placing Orders

If you‚Äôd like to order goods from other members of the corporation the use the #orders channel on discord. You can use the /orders bot command to initiate a purchase. 

Before starting an order, check the [corp price sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022), to see what kinds of prices corp members are offering. You'll often be able to place an internal corp order below the CX prices. You can quickly find the price for a material by entering the code in C1, and hitting enter. You‚Äôll get results something like this:

![alt_text](image4.png)

To place a order:

1. Open the [orders channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/1156955200867811450).
2. Type /order and hit space.
3. Enter the fields for the bot command
    1. Location - Where you wish the purchaser to collect the goods.
    2. Price
    3. Amount - The quantity of the good available for sale
    4. Item - The code for the goods. _For example, EPO for Epoxy Resin._
    5. Currency - e.g. AIC

_It‚Äôll look something like this once you‚Äôre done:_

![alt_text](image5.png)

4. Hit enter
5. Your order will then automatically be posted to the #orders channel for members to bid on.  \
_It‚Äôll look something like this:_


![alt_text](image6.png)

6. Await a member to offer to fulfil the order. Once they do it‚Äôll change to look something like this:

![alt_text](image7.png)


7. _If a contract has not been sent by the fulfilling member. _Send a contract in-game to the person to match the order details in discord.

**Note: **If the person who fulfils your order adds the ü´µemoji, that means they would like you to send them the contract, rather than them creating it.


### Bidding on Auctions

You can bid on goods offered by other players, for each auction posted by the bot you‚Äôll see options to bid for the full amount of goods available, as well as a bidding for a subset of the goods:

![alt_text](image8.png)

Once you‚Äôve clicked the buttons the auction message will automatically update. If there are bids for more goods than available, then upon finishing the auction, the bot will automatically calculate a fair distribution upon the bidding members. 

When you are bidding, the prices are set (they don‚Äôt increase as you bid). If you want a different price for a bid or an order, contact the person directly.


# Ship Construction

The corp model for ship construction has the ship-builder purchase all of the components individually from corp members. You can coordinate your purchases in the [#‚Å†ship-building channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/944644507050323968). If you want to help make ship components, that's great. Discuss it in the channel and add yourself as a supplier to the corp shipbuilding sheet. Most ship building components have a few suppliers in OOG. Redundancy is good though!


# Bank of OOG

The corp "bank" is not a formal bank, but members of the corp are encouraged to request expansion financing from veteran members of the corp in the Bank of OOG Discord channel, particularly for bases that produce materials in high demand such as RATs, AL, or C.  Loans are available from the bank and can repaid interest free over periods from 20-60 days.  Opportunities to repay with materials produced versus cash may be available.  Other special financing may be available and the corporation may proactively offer loans for specific high-need projects as well (for example, a new HE base).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #bank-of-oog channel.
