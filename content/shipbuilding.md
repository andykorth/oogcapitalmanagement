# Premium Shipbuilding

To streamline the process of buying a new ship, we offer a single model with immediate delivery. We have no month-long order queues or confusing roster of ships. Our premium 2k/2k carrier is a fantastic balance of features for the price.

* Fuel-Saving STL Engine uses half the fuel of a standard engine
* Quick-Charge FTL Reactor, a great balance of cost with 1/5th the charge time
* Medium STL and FTL fuel tanks, for enhanced range
* Large Cargo bay, the 2k/2k offers the best balance for most needs
* Lightweight hull plates improve acceleration
