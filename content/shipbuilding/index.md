## Instructions

Contact Archiel (preferably via Discord).  Create a ship blueprint that matches your ship blueprint image. Rent 4 warehouses on Hephaestus to store the entire ship, or insert components into the ship as you accept the contracts. Make sure to click "start" in the shipyard after adding all the components.
