# Premium Shipbuilding

To streamline the process of buying a new ship, we offer a single model that is immediately in stock. We have no month-long order queues or confusing roster of ships. Our premium 2k/2k carrier is a fantastic balance of features for the price.

* Fuel-Saving STL Engine uses half the fuel of a standard engine
* Quick-Charge FTL Reactor, a great balance of cost with 1/5th the charge time
* Medium STL and FTL fuel tanks, for enhanced range
* Large Cargo bay, the 2k/2k offers the best balance for most needs
* Lightweight hull plates improve acceleration

Generally orders should be filled within 24 hours. Your ship will take 23 hours to build. All items are delivered on Hephaestus in ANT space, which has a shipyard for immediate construction. Full fuel tanks are included.
