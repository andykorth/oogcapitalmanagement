# OOG Capital Management — Mission & Ideals

*Distilled from shareholder discussion, Feb 2026.*

---

## What OOG Is

- **An ANT-first organization.** Our primary commitment is to the health, stability, and development of the Antares region. Members are based in ANT or actively working toward it.
- **A high-trust network of capable players.** When you see an OOG member's name on a contract, you accept it. That trust is earned through selective membership and maintained through long-term relationships.
- **A space for advanced, strategic conversation.** OOG is where you come to talk about macro trends, regional development, governance, and high-capital opportunities — not to ask basic questions or learn the fundamentals. That's what ADI is for.
- **A talent pool, not a command structure.** OOG does not issue directives. It attracts skilled, independent players who find each other and build things together on their own initiative. Anyone can step up to run a project; no one is required to follow.
- **An "anarchic democracy."** Decisions are made by open discussion and polls among all members. There is no central authority, no ruling council, no one who speaks for OOG. This is a feature, not a bug — it is the source of our longevity and our lack of PR disasters.
- **A corp you graduate into.** New players belong in ADI, where they can grow. OOG is where established players find peers who operate at the same level and can have the conversations that no longer fit in a general-purpose discord.

## What OOG Is Not

- Not a grant organization or new-player support service.
- Not a top-down hierarchy where some members' voices count more.
- Not an organization defined by any single initiative (shipbuilding, governance, gateways) — participation in any of these is optional.
- Not ADI with a tighter age gate.

## Core Ideals

- **ANT loyalty** — Members commit to the Antares region. Expansion outside ANT is individual; the corp's collective identity is rooted here.
- **Individual excellence** — We value players who are advanced or aspiring to become advanced in their lane: governors, shipbuilders, market-makers, toolmakers, logisticians. Members are "Master Builders," not followers.
- **Long-term commitment** — OOG is for players who intend to be here for years, not months. "I'm planning on playing the game for years, I can wait." That attitude is what we want.
- **Flat culture** — No rank colors, no tiered prestige, no one issuing orders. Anyone who tries to speak for OOG externally will be corrected.
- **Openness within selectivity** — We are selective about who joins, but once inside, OOG is a genuinely open and welcoming community. The selectivity protects the culture; it is not a social hierarchy.
- **Governance and regional development** — Governors and those interested in planetary development are a core part of OOG's identity and value to the ANT region, though governance is not required for membership.
- **Good judgment and discretion** — Members can be trusted with sensitive information. They express disagreement constructively and do not embarrass the corp externally.
