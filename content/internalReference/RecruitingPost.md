# OOG Recruiting — Revised Public Post & Internal Standards

*Distilled from shareholder discussion, Feb 2026.*

---

## Public Recruitment Post

🚀 **About OOG:**

We are the premier corporation in Antares space and the largest governance organization in the universe. OOG was founded in early 2021 and now governs over 1 million citizens in ANT space. We work to ensure the stability and development of the Antares region, and to create a high-trust home for capable, long-term players.

Our corporation includes weekly dividends, governance training and support, shipbuilding, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system, and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities including base teleports. Our members are active across all timezones.

📈 **Recruitment Guidelines:**

OOG is a highly selective corp with limited available positions. Each candidate is discussed internally, then offered a trial period, followed by a full corp invite.

We're looking for members who:

* 🤝 Are team players — active in the corp and broader community
* 📡 Are primarily based and active in **ANT space**
* 🤜 Have an **existing working relationship with at least one OOG member**
* 💰 Have a **Pro License** and plan to maintain it
* 🏛️ *Bonus:* Interest in planetary governance, or already a governor
* 🔧 *Bonus:* Interest in developing or contributing to tools for the PrUn community
* 🏗️ *Bonus:* Interest in high-capital production (market-making, shipbuilding, gateway development)

## How to Get Considered

OOG is not an open-application corp. The best path in is to get to know someone already in OOG and work with them on something — a contract, a project, a shared initiative. If they think you'd be a good fit, they'll bring you up for internal discussion.

You can find OOG members in the ADI discord, in ANT space, and participating in regional development projects. We also maintain a public discord that anyone is welcome to join.

## Internal Evaluation Standards

These are the standards used for internal discussion of candidates. They are guidelines, not rigid gates — exceptions can be made with member support, but the defaults exist for a reason.

### Hard Floors
| Criterion | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Account age | **30 days** |
| Bases | **3+** |
| Location | **80%+ of bases in ANT sphere** |
| License | **Pro License, active** |

### Strong Preferences (soft requirements)
- Has an existing working relationship with at least one OOG member (traded, collaborated, or worked together on something)
- Communicates well in English
- Active in other PrUn discords — demonstrates community engagement beyond just building
- Shows a team-player attitude; doesn't cause drama or embarrass the org externally

### Nice to Have
- Decent growth-to-account-age ratio
- Interest in planetary governance; already governing somewhere
- Contributes to PrUn tools, documentation, or community projects
- Well-known to the broader ANT/PrUn community for good reasons
- Interest in high-capital production verticals (ships, gateways, market-making)

### Trial Period
- **Length:** Minimum 14 days; leaning toward 30 days as a standard to signal long-term intent.
- **Expectation:** Trials should be **relatively active in Discord** during their trial period. Silence during a trial is a signal that the candidate isn't that interested.
- **Outcome:** If a trial member goes quiet or doesn't seek full membership, they are simply un-greened — no drama required.

### Pace of Intake
- Be deliberate. Rapid influx of new members shifts the conversation and culture downward.
- If demand is high, consider capping active trials (e.g., 2 per month), with candidates proposed and briefly discussed before a trial is offered.
- Walk-ins who haven't been discussed or vouched for should be directed to establish a relationship first, rather than automatically offered a trial.

### Rejections
- We don't need to formally reject anyone. The standard approach: let it fade if the group isn't enthusiastic, or DM the candidate privately to explain the timeline/requirement and encourage them to come back later.
- If there is genuine concern (not just "unknown"), anyone can raise a quiet veto in the discussion channel.

### What We Are Not Selecting For
- Raw account age beyond 30 days (time is a poor proxy for skill or fit)
- Willingness to join — enthusiasm to join OOG is common; we should select for fit, not flattery
- Players who haven't demonstrated any engagement with ANT or OOG members

## Internal Notes on Culture Fit

The most important and least quantifiable criterion is whether a candidate will contribute to the quality of the community. This means:

- Can they handle high-level strategic conversation without needing everything explained?
- Do they have discretion? Will they not embarrass OOG in other discords or external interactions?
- Do they respect the flat culture — they won't try to accumulate influence or speak for OOG?
- Are they in it for the long haul? ("I'm planning on playing for years, I can wait.")

A useful internal framing: *"Would you bet an amount of your reputation that this person will be good for OOG?"* That question cuts through proxy metrics and gets to the heart of it.
