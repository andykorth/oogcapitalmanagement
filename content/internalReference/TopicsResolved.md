# OOG Topics — Findings & Resolutions

Based on discussions in #strategy and #recruitment-discussion (Feb 10–19, 2026) and the recruitment survey (20 responses).

## 1. Discord Roles — Replace the "Governor" Role

**Consensus: Strong agreement to act.**

The purple "governor" role no longer accurately reflects either governor status or OOG seniority. There are respected long-term members without it and inactive members who have it.

**Resolved:**
- Replace with a new role for **long-standing, respected members** who also handle Discord admin tasks (role management, pinning, adding bots, etc.)
- **No separate color.** Near-universal agreement that a visible color hierarchy would create a "tiered ranking" feel contrary to OOG culture.
- **Selection method:** Nomination by existing members — someone the corp already listens to and trusts, not simply the oldest accounts. Archiel's proposal and sidepipe's framing both landed well: "If there's a person you already listen to a bit more because you respect their opinions, that's who should have the role."
- **Name:** Not fully settled, but most energy around something that doesn't imply superiority. Options with support: *Senior Partner*, *Veteran*, *Anchor Investor*. *Booger Keeper* was popular as a joke to signal that it's not a prestigious position.

**Open item:** Finalize the name and run an initial nomination round.

## 2. Formal Leadership Group

**Consensus: No.**

The reaction poll was decisive: ❌ 8 vs ✅ 3 against creating a centralized leadership group.

The discussion clarified an important distinction that had been conflated:
- **Discord admin** (role management, moderation) — needed, solved by the Veterans role above.
- **Organizational governance** — *not needed*. OOG's lack of formal hierarchy is widely credited as the source of its longevity and cultural health.

Key sentiment (sidepipe): "I don't want a COSM-style leadership that speaks and expects everyone to fall in line."

Key sentiment (tanda): "The only thing centralized leadership is going to be able to do is disenfranchise at least some of those opinions."

Key sentiment (exeler): "We're all equals here. We should keep doing what we've been doing — a good ol' poll and letting the OOG Shareholders decide."

**Resolved:** The Veterans role handles Discord admin only. Corp-wide decisions continue via open discussion and polls. No separate governance tier.

## 3. Planet Roles

**Consensus: Remove them.**

No meaningful dissent. These made sense when ANT had 5 planets and members relied on each other's local production. That era is over.

**Resolved:** Delete all individual planet Discord roles.

---

## 4. Planet Channels

**Consensus: Convert to a Forum.**

The proposal with the most support (exeler, sidepipe, others): replace the individual planet channels with a **single forum channel** with one thread per planet. This preserves the ability to follow specific planets, reduces channel bloat, allows self-service addition of new planets, and is easy to scroll or ignore.

puzzlingblueorange's concern about keeping planet-specific discussion filterable is *addressed* by the forum/thread model.

**Resolved:** Create a "Planets" forum channel with per-planet threads. Archive or remove the old individual channels.

---

## 5. Inactivity

**Consensus: Done and ongoing.**

Sidepipe completed a cleanup in mid-February, retiring a substantial number of long-inactive members. The last prior cleanup was August 2024.

**Resolved:**
- Inactive members move to a **Retiree** role (can still see public channels, always welcome back).
- Periodic review going forward — sidepipe has taken ownership of this.
- Activity indicator: production drop-off is the best available signal (days-active is not in FIO).

## 6. Intelligence / Space Politics

**Consensus: Use existing channels; no dedicated intel channel needed now.**

agm114 raised the idea of an intel channel due to concerns about discussing sensitive inter-corp intelligence in public. tanda distinguished between *intelligence gathering* (fine) and *espionage/active sabotage coordination* (not OOG's thing). General sentiment: sharing screenshots from private servers is bad; discussion of inter-corp dynamics is fine.

**Resolved:**
- Use **#space-politics** with threads for sensitive topics. Short thread titles let people choose whether to read.
- An intel/sensitive-discussions channel could live inside the Veterans/senior area if the group wants to add it later.
- No policy against discussing game intelligence; implicit norm against coordinating active espionage.

## 7. Recruitment Standards

**Consensus: Several clear signals from both discussion and survey.**

**Minimum account age:** 30 days — strong consensus. This is a *floor*, not a proxy for skill. jackinabox86: "Whatever the standard is, stick to it so we don't have to re-discuss this constantly."

**Skill / engagement floor:** 3+ bases — survey showed 0% disagreement (no 1s or 2s). This matters more than raw time played. puzzlingblueorange: "There are things you learn in the process of getting 3 bases that we don't want to be teaching inside OOG."

**Sponsor/relationship requirement:** The poll's top result (13/20 reactions) was option 3: "invite-only / needs an OOG member to vouch." The refined consensus is: *a recruit should have an existing working relationship with at least one OOG member.* This can be formalized as sponsorship (someone actively vouches) or simply be an implicit gate in discussion.

**Trial period:** The survey showed a preference for extending beyond 7 days. Discussion landed around **14–30 days**, with Discord activity during the trial being a strong signal of fit (50% rated it a 4, 20% a 5).

**PRO License:** Preferred but not a hard gate. Slight survey support, not overwhelming.

**Pace of intake:** No appetite for mass recruiting. Some appetite for slow, deliberate growth. exeler's proposal of capping at 2 trials/month got positive traction as a way to enforce selectivity and make membership feel meaningful.

**What OOG is *not*:** Multiple voices aligned on this. OOG is not ADI. It is not a new-player support org. It is not a grant organization. Basic player assistance belongs in ADI. OOG should be the place you *graduate into*, where conversations operate at a higher level.

## 8. Off-Topic Channel

**No consensus either way.** agm114 noticed there isn't one; swatacular expressed preference for keeping the discord "professional." Left as-is for now unless someone makes a proposal.
