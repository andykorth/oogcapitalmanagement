## Introduction
We are the premier corporation in Antares space and the largest governance organisation in the universe. As a corporation, we work to ensure the stability of the Antares region, as well as creating a fun and engaging place for our members to enjoy the [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com/). [Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761220?utm_source=OOGCapitalManagement)

Our corporation includes governance training and support, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities, including base teleports. Our friendly group has members that are active in all timezones.

### Corp Rules
* Be active in the corp discord, the larger PRUN community, or participate any of the corp goals that align with your personal goals.
* Uphold the friendly and helpful spirit of the corp.
* Leave the in-game corporation if you decide to stop playing. If possible, pay it forward with your assets. 

### Onboarding Steps

1. Say hello in the [#general channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/854795108720443395).
2. Check the bank and #membership-perks channel to see if you can get some welcome money.
3. Skim through the other channels to see what projects might interest you.

# Internal Market

The corporation operates an internal market for goods, offering preferential access to our trial and shareholding members. This is a great way to combat shortages and market shenanigans. 

OOG doesn't dictate any prices. When choosing a price, common techniques include looking in discord for previous auction prices or looking at bid or ask prices on the ANT CX. 

Our old [Corp Google Sheet, on the Prices tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022) contains historical pricing info, but it is pretty out of date now, and should only be used as a historical reference.


## Buying and Selling Goods

Currently, our buying and selling mostly happens with our [auction and order](/shareholders/auctions-and-orders/) system. Thanks to Exeler for fantastic work on this tool!


# Ship Construction

The corp model for ship construction has the ship-builder purchase all of the components individually from corp members. You can coordinate your purchases in the [#⁠ship-building channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/944644507050323968). If you want to help make ship components, that's great. Discuss it in the channel and add yourself as a supplier to the corp shipbuilding sheet. Most ship building components have a few suppliers in OOG. Redundancy is good though!


# Bank of OOG

The corp "bank" is not a formal bank, but members of the corp are encouraged to request expansion financing from veteran members of the corp in the Bank of OOG Discord channel, particularly for bases that produce materials in high demand such as RATs, AL, or C.  Loans are available from the bank and can repaid interest free over periods from 20-60 days.  Opportunities to repay with materials produced versus cash may be available.  Other special financing may be available and the corporation may proactively offer loans for specific high-need projects as well (for example, a new HE base).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #bank-of-oog channel.
