## Introduction
We are the premier corporation in Antares space and the largest governance organisation in the universe. As a corporation, we work to ensure the stability of the Antares region, as well as creating a fun and engaging place for our members to enjoy the Prosperous Universe. 

Our corporation includes governance training and support, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities, including base teleports. Our friendly group has members that are active in all timezones.

### Corp Rules
* Continue to be an active contributing member of OOG.
* Willingness to aid in corp expansion goals.
* Leave the in-game corporation if you decide to stop playing.

### Onboarding Steps

1. Say hello in the [#general channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/854795108720443395).
2. Update the [Corp Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=0) with your company details.
    1. Add your [planets to the planets tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=0). 
        1. Add your company details at the end of the sheet in column A. Your user, company name, then company code.
        2. For each planet on which you have a base, find the associated column, and enter the number of each production building. Highlight any production buildings at the end of longer production chains in red.
    2. Add any goods you wish to sell via the internal corp market to the Prices tab. _See more details for how this works in [Selling Goods](#selling-goods).


# Internal Market

The corporation operates an internal market for goods, offering preferential prices to trial and shareholding members. You can find the current prices for goods in the [Corp Google Sheet, on the Prices tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022).


## Selling Goods


### Price Listing

If you wish to sell goods within the corp then you are encouraged to add these to the [Prices tab in the Corp Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=489658022). If you have not already, add your user & company details as a new section prior to the “Inactive / Retired Players” row. 

_Tip: If you want your name to appear when members search for goods, you need to make sure that every row relevant for your corp has your username in column B (this is hidden most of the time by shrinking it to 5px wide column, so can be missed easily). _

For example (in rows 136-139, columns A-D):

| Akyan | Akyan |  |  EPO @ 140 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Ingenious Innovations Inc | Akyan |  |  NR @ 350 |
| III | Akyan |  | C @ 500  | 
|     | Akyan |  | H @ 70   |

The listing of goods enables all corp members to:

* Price up expansion efforts by utilizing goods offered at discounted prices by members.
* Understand what goods are manufactured by other members, and enable decisions about how they might expand their manufacturing. Redundancy is generally good, so don’t be put off if a good is already offered by other members.


# Ship Construction

The corp model for ship construction has the ship-builder purchase all of the components individually from corp members. You can coordinate your purchases in the [#⁠ship-building channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/854795108720443393/944644507050323968). If you want to help make ship components, that's great. Discuss it in the channel and add yourself as a supplier to the corp shipbuilding sheet. Most ship building components have a few suppliers in OOG. Redundancy is good though!


# Bank of OOG

The corp "bank" is not a formal bank, but members of the corp are encouraged to request expansion financing from veteran members of the corp in the Bank of OOG Discord channel, particularly for bases that produce materials in high demand such as RATs, AL, or C.  Loans are available from the bank and can repaid interest free over periods from 20-60 days.  Opportunities to repay with materials produced versus cash may be available.  Other special financing may be available and the corporation may proactively offer loans for specific high-need projects as well (for example, a new HE base).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #bank-of-oog channel.
