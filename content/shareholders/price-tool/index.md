# Bid creation price tool

Before using this tool, visit the [Storage Management](/storage-tool/) scroll to the bottom, and import modeled prices. These prices are imported from [Taiyi's Price Model](https://benten.space/calculator/pricecalc) calculator.

Prices listed here are the highest bid. If the highest bid is under the imported modeled price, then it will be marked green.
