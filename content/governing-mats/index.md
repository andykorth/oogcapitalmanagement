# Governing Material Efficiencies

Pricing data is pulled from Prunplanner's PP7d universe prices. Then we calculate the amount of upkeep per dollar provided by each material in each category. Generally you should try to fill materials from most upkeep per dollar to least, and fill as many as are needed to reach your target need %. See our guide on [learning how to govern](/posts/good-governance/).
