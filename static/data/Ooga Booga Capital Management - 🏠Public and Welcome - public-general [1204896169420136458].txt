Hi


[17-Feb-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hi KaiserZero, welcome! What brings you to OOG? Are you a prospective member?


[17-Feb-24 12:03 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Heho @kaiserzero_


[07-Apr-24 05:32 PM] katinga#0000
Hello!  Nice place you have here!


[07-Apr-24 06:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Welcome! Copying this over in case you can‚Äôt view the general channel yet, I forget how the roles work:


[07-Apr-24 06:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
TuffyLess: Hey guys,

Katinga may be interested in joining OOG so I gave him our Discord link here, so we all could get to know each other.

Can someone get him the Discord Roles when ya get a free moment, that are appropriate at this stage.

In the meantime Katinga, you should be able to see a couple Public channels/threads, which serve as a slight introduction.

Any questions or discussion items you have, plz feel free to shoot away. üôÇ  Many of us are in-and-out of here at various times daily.  
Welcome to OOG.


[07-Apr-24 07:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got you set up as a trial member. Welcome!


[07-Apr-24 07:20 PM] katinga#0000
thank you!  I'm kinda not sure where to start


[07-Apr-24 08:01 PM] tuffyless#0000
I'll take a shot at that üôÇ ... 

Auctions are where we sell materials to each other under the CX price.  
Use /auction to announce an auction where you are the seller.  
The seller both starts and ends the auction; they typically run from hours to days.
When the seller ends an auction, they then send the contd's in-game.

Orders are the opposite; this is where one of us is looking to buy a material for under CX price.
The seller will put in how many their will to buy at a stated price.  
Again, the seller sends the contd's in-game to the buyer, after they enter how much they'll sell here.

These are available to you as a trial member.

Trial membership lasts for ~7 days'ish starting today.

After ~7 days and if you want to become OOG, then you'll be added to the in-game corp.  That will afford you a 10% production bonus on Nike and a piece of the pie from all the weekly taxes collected by all OOG planet governors.

You'll then be encouraged to find a planet to govern.  Start with a low pop/outer rim planet to learn the ropes.  You'll need to keep the CoGC and POPI filled with material for continued planet CoGC bonus/population growth.  Also will need to interact with people on the planet, in in-game chat, as needed.

After awhile, you'll have learned how the basics of how the POPR works.  You can then decide to stay as gov of your 1st planet or to find another planet that is larger in populate/more busy.  The challenge of governorship will then be increased.


[07-Apr-24 08:03 PM] tuffyless#0000

A couple of us specialize in making ship components, used to build new ships.  They'll sell mat's to you via in-game contd's.

Others specialize in mats for HQ-upgrades.

OOG has a bank, but I've never been involved with it's inner-workings so someone else will need to fill you in on that.

The spreadsheet found in this thread will show you corp prices:

Guess I'll end with that 2 of your planets on near BEN region.  Proxion & Etherwind.

Most of the OOG players are focused in on the ANT region.  Many of us have bases outside of ANT of course but the core is in ANT.

The chances are low that you'll be able to get much direct shipping or material support for your bases outside of the core.

**Example**: you'll be able to buy consumables from the auction or order channel and have it delivered somewhere in ANT, most probably the ANT CX station, but it will most likely be up to you, to ship it yourself to Proxion.

[08-Apr-24 06:32 AM] katinga#0000
I do see a channel here for Etherwind.  As for Proxion, one of my long term goals is to move operations from there to Life.  I actually shut down my starter base at Gibson and moved it to Nascent.  I have goals to be more ANT centric, it just takes some time.


[08-Apr-24 06:18 PM] katinga#0000
What do you want to know about me?


[08-Apr-24 08:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
favorite vidyer game


[08-Apr-24 10:01 PM] katinga#0000
I thought vidyer was a blimp that flew over football games


[09-Apr-24 12:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
Nah that's goodya


[09-Apr-24 04:55 PM] zipatsu#0000
Just out of general curiosity, what kind of goals are you aiming for with your company at the moment? I saw that you're on Etherwind as well so if it's anything H2O related I can supply a fairly big batch of BSE at a greatly discounted price if it would help you get started ‚úåÔ∏è


[09-Apr-24 05:01 PM] katinga#0000
I am mining SIO and running burners for C for my smelters on Vulcan.  If it makes sense to you, I'm aiming to keep my company focused on raw materials to stray true to the company name.  So mining and smelting.  I would have set my ag operation on Deimos if I were able.  I had to settle for Proxion instead.


[09-Apr-24 05:09 PM] zipatsu#0000
Pretty much my entire company revolves around raw materials, (Nike & Deimos are there just to create my own BSE supply to keep costs down and Harmonia's creating some Agriculture products to sell in corp just because I don't want to give up my first base)  so that does make sense to me yeah üòÑ Way less of a hassle to keep things operating smoothly too.


[09-Apr-24 05:09 PM] zipatsu#0000
Guess Deimos was full then?


[09-Apr-24 05:10 PM] churavis#0000
We have Nascent for burning C if you'd like a planet with Resource Extraction bonus and no premium building mats


[09-Apr-24 05:18 PM] zipatsu#0000
I believe they're already on Nascent from the message above üòÖ


[09-Apr-24 05:20 PM] katinga#0000
my ALO mining op is on Nascent


[09-Apr-24 05:21 PM] katinga#0000
Yes.


[09-Apr-24 05:23 PM] katinga#0000
I could set up on Life, but that's more expensive


[09-Apr-24 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
Life is expensive


[09-Apr-24 05:24 PM] katinga#0000
Life.  Don't talk to me about Life.  Here, I am.  Brain the size of a planet...

I love the old BBC mini series


[10-Apr-24 08:13 AM] katinga#0000
I noticed Vulcan doesn't have its own channel.  Is that the stepchild of ANT or something?


[10-Apr-24 08:45 AM] domicius#0000
It does have a channel. All planets do.

Yeah the planet chats made more sense when there were like 4 of them


[10-Apr-24 11:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think it's practical to add them all , especially since everyone has a lot more bases and a lot more mobility/logistics than in the very early universe.


[10-Apr-24 11:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
That being said I don't really have a better suggestion for reorganizing them all


[10-Apr-24 11:49 AM] katinga#0000
maybe by region.  not sure what else to suggest.


[10-Apr-24 04:38 PM] katinga#0000

[15-May-24 06:08 AM] darjaves#0000
For the maker / designer of the bot. U can use this kinda code for the bot to specefic channel use

channel_id = 1156955200867811450
async def orders(ctx):
    if ctx.channel == bot.get_channel(channel_id):
        await ctx.send("what u wanne send")

This is python, but, like, this channel 1156955200867811450 ==> orders

Yep

The corporate production sheet, you can just add some rows, pick a color, and add what you'd like to sell. Since this is the public channel, you can find the sheet linked in the #general channel pins.

[09-Jun-24 01:24 AM] donmega1983#0000
Good morning. I have produced a CQL component. I don't need it anymore and would like to sell it. Can anyone use it? I'd say the starting price is 2 million CIS.


[09-Jun-24 08:17 AM] katinga#0000
You could offer it for auction?


[10-Jun-24 06:36 AM] donmega1983#0000
I haven't done that yet. How do you do that?


[10-Jun-24 06:36 AM] donmega1983#0000
I haven't done that yet. How do you do that?


[10-Jun-24 08:21 AM] churavis#0000
I already produce plenty of CQL and sell them to our corp at far less than CX prices. If I bought your CXL I would have to sell it on the CX myself, which would take time, tie up capital, and risk losing money if the market shifts. Considering this, I could only take it with a significant discount, something with a price around 1.2 million CIS. You could certainly sell it on the CX for more, but you'd be tying up your own capital and carrying the risk yourself while waiting who knows how long.


[10-Jun-24 12:51 PM] exeler#0000
There's a bot in this server that provides an auction command. It's better suited for selling multiple items more than a single item since it's not really an auction with increasing bids.

We do those in the #auctions channel, but I think that's for members of OOG and trial candidates only.


[10-Jun-24 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since the price is a bit high and in CIS, you might have better luck selling it on the UFO server: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/855496119713660949

Everyone welcome MaxKalina! Max is a returning player who is interested in learning more about ANT space. They're currently based mostly outside of ANT, but are rebuilding their bases, and looking for a future home. We chatted a bit about recruitment possibilities and how we're mostly focused in the ANT region, so we're gonna figure out if it might be a good fit in the future. 

Feel free to take a look at the rules in #public-welcome  and let us know if you have any questions about OOG!

Me and my partner will learn more about ANT space and discuss possible expansion in your space!
Bit about me: like those game a lot, had a pause because of hard time with my job.
My partner is not speaking English well. He had a big business in past, but lost it due to inactivity.
I am more specialized in food, beverages and all the consumables, chemistry.
Partner in construction, manufacturing, software and ship parts building.
I am repairing my buildings, as I was absent 2 years.

Hey guys!
So we decided to open bases in ANT space.
My partner - TimurOm (T-Const TCT) will start a mixed (resource extraction and metallurgy) base on Deimos, with future expansion on Nascent with relocation of his HQ on Deimos.
I will start a bit later a base on Norwick, moving there my food production. I will leave on Hortus only agricultural and chemistry bases.
It will take around 2 weeks to start our first bases in ANT space.

Hey guys! How are you?
We need an advice: which HQ based efficiency gain bonuses, main well developed ANT planets do have?
As I understood from the test server Fobos, Deimos and Naskent do provide electronic efficiency gain bonus. What about Norwick and other planets? 
This will help us to plan better our relocation.


[01-Jul-24 12:33 PM] max.kalina#0000
Am I right that all ANT space have only electronic efficiency gain bonus, based on wiki?


[01-Jul-24 12:34 PM] exeler#0000
I think the HQ bonuses are based on the faction, not on specific planets. 

So if you put your HQ on any ANT planet you'll get the electronics boost

Hey, since I'm on this Romulan kick lately, we can say that Etherwind is in the Neutral Zone, which is pretty much Romulan territory anyway, right?  I mean ever notice how quickly a warbird comes out of warp when you get too close?

Hey guys!


[10-Jul-24 11:50 PM] timomurbekov#0000
So I arrived to Deimos with all the materials for base, but I can't start base due no available plots


[10-Jul-24 11:52 PM] timomurbekov#0000
Your advice: to wait or to find another planet to settle?


[11-Jul-24 12:00 AM] domicius#0000
Might be a good question to ask on the help channel actually


[11-Jul-24 12:00 AM] domicius#0000
I imagine you can rent a warehouse and dump the stuff there, in case a plot opens up


[11-Jul-24 12:01 AM] domicius#0000
Or you can ask on the Deimos channel if anyone wants to give up a base


[11-Jul-24 12:02 AM] domicius#0000
@archielvahr is there a mechanism that adds extra plots for players?


[11-Jul-24 12:30 AM] timomurbekov#0000
@domicius thanks for the help, I thought that number (+58) means free extra plots and it was a surprise to arrive and only in this moment to be aware that it is not possible to build a baseü•¥

{Reactions}
üòï 

[11-Jul-24 12:37 AM] domicius#0000
I believe it means players above plot maximum

Ahh yeah Deimos is above the cap right now, the ghost plots mean new players had been starting there


[11-Jul-24 12:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Vulcan is a nearby alternative though, it has the same COGC


[11-Jul-24 12:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Downside is that it does need HSE (I think)


[11-Jul-24 12:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I haven't been watching the flow of Deimos.. but if it's 58 over I don't think I'd wait....

Hello OOG! Archiel invited me to the server so I could network. I lead Stardust Trading, a new corp focused on trading and services. We're not ready for our public launch yet, but I figured networking with OOG at least would be beneficial.

One of our core corp specialties is wholesale purchases and supply, so we are eager to help with anyone needing a buyer if they have a large amount of goods to move, and sometimes we are able to supply large amounts of goods regularly as well.

[29-Jul-24 12:58 PM] insulacrisium#0000
Yep, one of our biggest businesses is buying wholesale quantities from large suppliers regularly, and also buying surplus intermittently. We're up for pretty much any commodity. üòÑ


[29-Jul-24 12:59 PM] insulacrisium#0000
Yes, we also have supplies of a few intermediate ship components. I think the OOG shipbuilding program is cool, because it allows people to buy ships faster than most shipbuilders are able to.


[29-Jul-24 01:00 PM] insulacrisium#0000
I'm interested in seeing if there's anything we can do to help you all have better availability of ship components, since your availability is what sets you apart from other shipbuilders.


[29-Jul-24 01:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
@melon164  had mentioned needing DEC. I would certainly take some too.


[29-Jul-24 01:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Right now our biggest need seems to be LCB, MSL, MFL. I put up an order in our shipbuilding channel, so I'll give people a day or so to respond then let you know where supplies end up


[29-Jul-24 01:36 PM] melon164#0000
Yes, I would be interested in a price for 500 DEC.


[29-Jul-24 02:05 PM] insulacrisium#0000
I don't have an immediate supply of DEC, but I know a few people who make it. I asked them and I'll follow up here!


[29-Jul-24 02:11 PM] insulacrisium#0000
We have good supplies of MSL and LCB. MFL is tougher for us because of ZR being harder to obtain. However, if you're going to be buying it at scale, we probably have people in DUST willing to set up a base for it. We've just not done that yet because we didn't know that we'd have enough scale to make that worth it.

LCB and MSL likewise our supplier is interested in expanding, but I'd need a rough idea of weekly/monthly quantities we're talking about to be sure it's worth it first. I'd rather be a little understocked than end up overstocked and unable to sell our supply.


[29-Jul-24 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Thoughts everyone? Esp @hernanduer ? I think the first priority is making sure your supplier has their SKF busy at 100% before adding a second SKF. To keep things simple for them and us, maybe we do something balanced like 2x LCB, 2x MSL, 2x MFL per week.


[29-Jul-24 02:21 PM] insulacrisium#0000
I think I've already maxed out his SKF at our present volumes already, tbh. üòÑ

{Reactions}
üëç 

[29-Jul-24 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then some reference points on prices: Our internal prices are MFL: 80k, MSL: 100k, LCB 325k. Our external sales prices are a little bit higher, 125k, 150k, 420k respectively. At the external sales prices it's sort of just enabling sales of other components via batching the goods. So that has _some_ value just in terms of moving product. I guess we'll have to see what works for them.


[29-Jul-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
SKF are cheap to idle at least, so no worries if a 2nd isn't filled. I'm not sure what volume makes sense here though. If we buy from them at discounted but guaranteed prices only for the ship sales program, that might make sense. I already sell my SKF stuff at rock bottom internally, so I can't imagine them wanting to sell at those prices


[29-Jul-24 02:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make up the difference for myself by the odd 500-600k sales on CXs


[29-Jul-24 02:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, we get blasted for OOG ships not being competitive, but the LCB in our bundle is at 420k... so if someone can sell it for 600k on the CX, I wouldn't blame them.


[29-Jul-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
But those markups are similar for all the engine and ftl components too.


[29-Jul-24 03:17 PM] insulacrisium#0000
Interesting, so just so I'm clear, your external prices are what you'd sell the parts for if hypothetically you were selling them a la carte instead of all as a kit? (Which I know isn't what you actually do, but I suppose you still need a price on the contract selling just the one part.)

Our comparison typical price is about 600-700k for LCB and 160-175k for MSL (haven't dealt in MFL yet due to having difficulties getting a ZR supply), via CX ask sales. The CX is so high lately; I think there is a ship parts shortage.

It sounds like we're unfortunately at very different pricing then. How is your liquidity? One way I try to bridge the gap when I'm looking at selling something and taking a low (or no) margin is to see if the buyer has room to prepay. That has value to us, and some have so much free liquidity that it's a small cost to them.


[29-Jul-24 03:21 PM] insulacrisium#0000
My supplier is fairly vertically integrated, so tbh, it's probably somewhere further up his supply chain that I've maxed out rather than his SKF. But the way I'm looking at it, if we can justify adding capacity either via guaranteed sales, or likely sales, it may also help also with our CX sales availability.


[29-Jul-24 03:22 PM] insulacrisium#0000
---
I also have a supply of LFE, but I forget if that's useful for your ship design.


[29-Jul-24 03:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah unfortunately I have 100s of LFE and MFE and SFE and 50+ FFC. üòÅ

Generally liquidity isn‚Äôt much of a problem. Up to 20 million or 30 million could be floated easily for ship construction. Beyond that I would have to rope in other members of OOG.


[29-Jul-24 03:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
As far as those prices, yes, even though they are sold as kits every item has a price assigned to it. Due to how we source, the items, there isn‚Äôt a lot of wiggle room on prices unless it changes the price for a different producer. So if LCB prices go up then a different producer would need to drop their price or the ship kit price would have to change


[29-Jul-24 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a long time, we were selling ships only as components on the CX, because the prices are higher. But not all customers are willing to buy ships that way. So it doesn‚Äôt capture a very big part of the market.


[29-Jul-24 03:43 PM] insulacrisium#0000
Yeah, selling as kits seems like it lets you capture a higher market share (volume), but you have to go for lower margin. A worthy tradeoff.


[29-Jul-24 03:52 PM] insulacrisium#0000
Alright, I might have a little more wiggle room on price for something like a monthly supply deal, where you pay a month or two ahead of time for a predetermined amount. Maybe I could offer something just a little below your external prices so you had a little margin and I still had a little margin too. I think probably it wouldn't be mutually beneficial though unless like you said it was basically enabling sales of your other parts.

Maybe we can wait to hash out more details until any other people involved have a chance to chime in.


[29-Jul-24 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that sounds like some good options we can discuss and work towards.


[29-Jul-24 04:07 PM] katinga#0000
I would be interested in DEC as well


[01-Aug-24 12:48 PM] insulacrisium#0000
@melon164 @katinga I'm still working on finding a large enough supply of DEC. I found 200 DEC, but best price I could offer would be 19k/u for all of it. Let me know if that's of interest to you.

[03-Aug-24 01:54 PM] insulacrisium#0000
@archielvahr  On LCB, MSL, and MSL- we've been running the numbers.  We won't be able to produce MFL competitively enough to be of interest to you buying.  However, we could offer 8 LCB and 8 MSL per month at 130k per MSL and 410k per LCB, if it was prepaid a month ahead of time.  We can increase volumes past 8 per month as well, but would need some advance notice for planning.


[03-Aug-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lemme ask my shipbuilding team their thoughts, thank you for all your legwork!


[03-Aug-24 03:07 PM] insulacrisium#0000
No problem


[05-Aug-24 10:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sorry for the late reply, I think this sounds great, I'd like to go ahead with that. Feel free to send contracts for the prepayment, if you want to set it up in any particular way, we can do that


[05-Aug-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think we have two options for organizing it:
1) I send 8 * 130k + 8 * 410k in cash up front, you send the LCBs and MSLs as they are done for free.
2) I send you a 0% interest loan for that 4,320,000. Then I pay at the above rate each time the items are delivered. Every week a bit of the loan gets repaid with the money I sent to purchase that product. 

Option 1) is easy and I don't mind the risk. Someone would have to track deliveries to ensure they add up to 8 and 8 for that payment cycle.

Option 2) ties the payment to the delivery through the contract system. We can out the repayment by a week in case there's a delay, but you can always sell more components ahead of schedule, meaning you get free funds for the duration before the loan is due. (which is how Costco works their inventory, in the US, their product turnover is so high they sell the product before the payment is due to their suppliers for that payment).


[06-Aug-24 04:44 AM] insulacrisium#0000
Actually, I was thinking of for simplicity, having two contracts, one for 8 MSL, and one for 8 LCB, each with delivery due a month after payment is due, on the same contract.

However, if you'd prefer to get deliveries more regularly, maybe we could do contracts like that except for quantities of 4 and 4, and just do it biweekly.  Maybe that would be better anyway, so that I don't have to sit on them while you could be using them already.


[06-Aug-24 07:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, sooner deliveries is good. Happy to organize it whatever works for you. I figured your partners might need the money up front for the whole month

@archielvahr , I sent the contracts to you for 4 MSL and 4 LCB.  Are you the correct contract recipient?

I set the first delivery to be due in two weeks- does that work for you all?

Looking forward to partnering together!


[10-Aug-24 10:35 AM] insulacrisium#0000

I don't know if I mentioned it already, but we will probably have a good supply of WCB as well, if that's something that you all will need?


[10-Aug-24 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, those contracts look great, thank you!


[10-Aug-24 10:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think we have plans to sell WCB ships, but I think we would use them internally


[10-Aug-24 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also 410k per WCB?


[10-Aug-24 10:45 AM] insulacrisium#0000
My suppliers cost for WCB is a little higher than LCB for some reason.  I haven't asked why yet (or I forgot, lol).

It's 25k higher, so I could do 435k on the WCB.


[10-Aug-24 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think we'd only want a few so maybe I'll just consider that a one-off purchase of 4 WCB


[10-Aug-24 10:46 AM] insulacrisium#0000
must have something to do with FET vs AST prices


[10-Aug-24 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah TI has been high lately so it might be throwing those alloys  into disarray

[10-Aug-24 10:47 AM] insulacrisium#0000
sure, we can do one-offs on it.  We'd need some time on it though, since we're still scaling up WCB production.  Probably couldn't deliver on a quantity of 4 for about 4-6 weeks.


[10-Aug-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sure, no rush there


[10-Aug-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
They are likely to just end up in WCB upgrade kits for OOG members

Good day everyone!
So I am close to open my first base in ANT space.
It is gonna be Chemistry base, so I need an advice: Griffonstone or Bober.
Bober needs TSH, but it is in the heart of ANT, Griffonstone is a bit far away.
Bober has a bit more of ENG and SCI, but higher taxes.
Griffonstone has less open jobs and better POPI.
So I am in doubts.
What will you advice?


[11-Aug-24 05:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Personnaly I quite liked griffinstone. It‚Äôs still only 12hr away from Ant so you can do a round trip in 1 day

hi


[13-Oct-24 06:18 PM] gamgee4841#0000
for joining the corp? i'm on moria, i've been a player few years ago, a constructor


[13-Oct-24 07:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hi Gamgee and welcome to the discord! OOG is focused on the Antares region of space so I don‚Äôt think we would be a great match for you if you are mostly around Moria. Do you have plans to move to ANT?


[13-Oct-24 07:37 PM] gamgee4841#0000
for sure i will put more than one base on Antares


[13-Oct-24 07:56 PM] gamgee4841#0000
*near antares


[13-Oct-24 09:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I notice you played before back in May, but it looks like you've restarted since then. I think if you've only just started 20 hours ago, you should consider COLIQing and restarting in ANT space. Then check out the Antares Development Initiative, ADI. They offer a lot of help to new players to help you get started. I am one of the coordinators there, and we offer 1mil AIC grants to new players in ANT. So you'll get off to a fast start that way


[13-Oct-24 09:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
After that, once you're established with us, check back in, and we'll see if it's a good fit


[13-Oct-24 10:15 PM] gamgee4841#0000
no actually I played in 2019 for about a year. it was the beginning of PrUn, it seems to me there were many fewer players than now


[13-Oct-24 10:19 PM] gamgee4841#0000
back then I was a constructor with first base in moria anyway. for this reason I would like to keep the same start. I plan to pay for the pro version, so I should have access to loans, FX and local markets


[13-Oct-24 10:22 PM] gamgee4841#0000
being a constructor it shouldn't take me long to build a second base near antares. are you saying that this would slow down anyway?


[14-Oct-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it typically takes a month or two for someone without grant money or loans to get their second base started


[14-Oct-24 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Been a while since I started though, maybe someone else can hop in


[14-Oct-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think ADI would still give the grant once you got your ANT base going, but it's worth pointing out that Deimos is full, so starting on Deimos is the only way to get a base there, so that's a good reason to start in ANT


[14-Oct-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also ANT is a stronger region for constructors due to the abundance of aluminum, which is a better choice than Iron


[15-Oct-24 01:07 AM] gamgee4841#0000
are there good alternatives to Deimos to base?


[15-Oct-24 01:32 AM] gamgee4841#0000
since you will have a lot of experience regarding the right planets to make a base


[15-Oct-24 01:32 AM] gamgee4841#0000
i in the ANT space


[15-Oct-24 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Deimos is really strong for metallurgy. Vulcan is a good alternative for that. For construction, Nike is one of the best planets in the game. It has limestone available, and has the construction COGC, plus the OOG headquarters, for another 10% bonus.


[15-Oct-24 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
As for other planets in ANT that are good for starting, take a look at our guide here: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/starting-in-antares/

[15-Oct-24 09:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
Deimos + Nike is a really great pair for someone starting in construction. Because you can make your aluminum really effectively on Deimos, get the Limestone on Nike, and make the fabs there

pirates were quite aggressive a couple years ago. they got tuned down afaik.

I mostly focused on exploration before as a somewhat chill experience. There's loads of exploration been added... couldn't land on planets when I last played.


[09-Nov-24 12:28 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
that's quite a long time ago.
now we have third party tools that help you plot a course through different star systems that pay a lot of money for the exploration data.

@turlorn_angren  I've had some fun with VR ED, being able to freely look around while dogfighting was a huge boon. I was mostly in to exploration and getting cool screenshots (my profile pic), but my brother was really big into PVP and had some pretty wild encounters.


[12-Nov-24 06:19 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I think I stopped playing because of the grind. End game mods and gameplay are expensive and a chore to fund.

I'm not really sure what "joining" a corp really means or entails in Prun. I don't expect anyone to agree with all of my views, directions or assessments... as I would not agree with those from another person (or corp). I am, have been and will continue to be an independent actor within the game.

For a variety of reasons, I'm currently in the process of re-shoring a lot of my permits back into the ANT region. So I'm doubling down on this region of space in terms of bases, CX activity, developing new planets, and generally taking actions that increase the productive capacity of the region. I strongly suspect that my goals in this respect - align with the broader goals of the OOG community.

If your goals are the same as my goals - I think it makes sense to put myself in a position to make future developments, trade and collaboration quicker/easier. As far as "Joining" a group in Prun - I don't know what that really means at this point.

But to speak from my own experience - we help each other out, work together on big projects, boost new players, that sort of thing. I've never once been ordered to made to do anything I don't want to do (except the blood oath, which we don't talk about). But I did find a group of cool people to play the game with, bounce ideas off of, buy and sell stuff from and to. That sort of thing. I personally don't do shipbuilding, but lots of folks in the corp collaborate to build ships together


[21-Nov-24 07:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
For example, the internal market is entirely voluntary. You set your own prices, and you choose if you want to sell here or buy here. I make a lot of FIM - sometimes I sell it on the CX, sometimes I broprice it here because I can sell 2000 of it in a few days üòÑ


[21-Nov-24 07:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since you're quite advanced in the game, most of the perks probably don't matter very much to you. But there's (in my experience) not really any responsibilities either, so I'd encourage you to do the trial if you're interested or curious. No one will judge you if you decide it's not for you üôÇ


[21-Nov-24 07:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ for your size you probably enjoy buying here. Maybe at some point you will be selling here as well


[21-Nov-24 07:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions here or in DMs if you have any!


[21-Nov-24 07:58 PM] evov#0000
Yea, I don't think the membership "perks" apply to me that much.

It's mostly (for me at least) about
1. Getting more involved in a community who's goals align with my own.
2. Enabling more free/active trade, deals, arrangements with people. 

I think it helps remove the risk of piracy / someone operating in bad faith when dealing with someone active in a discord community. To me, that's a signal that they'll value their reputation above whatever potential gains they may make by stealing.

My experience with someone trying to invite me into the oog discord years ago, was that there were a lot of strings attached, so I declined and went my own way. If those strings aren't there anymore, drag me in.


[21-Nov-24 08:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Good enough for me!


[21-Nov-24 08:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
There is 0 strings attached as far as I am aware. Everyone is doing their own things but sometimes our interests align

So, I'm a pretty new player, being totally honest I have a tenuous grasp at best of the game, always seem to run out of fuel. ^_^ 

But, I'm Lilli, I like PrUN since I started about 23 days ago. I got the Star package and have yet to name anything, I like a lot of other games like Warframe and magic the gathering. So, yeah! 

And speak of the devil...

hi all üëã  some of us over in Benten space are starting to get off our butts and think seriously about gateways.  we are way behind you all OGG folks (based on [this](https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/what-we-know-about-gateways/) excellent post).  i wanted to reach out to see if we could share contact info, in case any coordination is desired.   is there someone in particular on your side that's coordinating things?

Hi and welcome! I guess I am doing a lot of organizing, much of Antares is aligned under the ADI gateway coop.


[02-Dec-24 09:36 PM] eminence32#0000
would it be better to move over to the ADI discord?  (i admit i'm not fully clear on the relationship between OOG and ADI)


[02-Dec-24 09:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Captain coleslaw and I had been chatting. I think the most important note is the gateway from Heph to Styx Planet c. We expect them a gateway from there to Katoa

what does being active in corp and community entail?

Basically any type of interaction, we don‚Äôt demand anything specific, but we are looking for players who aren‚Äôt totally invisible. So that can be chatting in discord, involvement in any of the corp projects. Or the auctions or orders. Writing blog posts or tools is amazing. Doing governance stuff or other cooperative projects like ship building.

Helping new people in the corp or in the game is also a great option. Basically anything that might interest you along those lines

What‚Äôs your favorite corvid?


[31-Dec-24 04:17 PM] _alecto#0000
Probably an obvious answer, but the raven. Very elegant, and they make for great poetry.


[31-Dec-24 04:19 PM] _alecto#0000
I also love that a group of crows is called a murder, and a group of ravens is called an unkindness.


[31-Dec-24 04:20 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
This raven drops by my house on occasion

That is an excellent raven. Looks very personable.


[31-Dec-24 04:22 PM] _alecto#0000
My guardian likes to feed the crows in her backyard. They're thugs. They're also weirdly protective of her.


[31-Dec-24 04:25 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Corvids are awfully discerning customers, they eat all the most expensive nuts I put out for them first like walnuts and cashews


[31-Dec-24 04:28 PM] _alecto#0000
I believe it. xD Very smart too.


[31-Dec-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a pet cockatiel and she will sometimes eat all the banana-shaped pellets in her tray. And sometimes she'll eat everything but the bananas. And the funny thing is they all taste identical, they just are shaped and colored differently üòÑ

Consider that SI bid is currently 1600 and one SI goes into producing one LCR...
I feel that your bid is somewhat on the low end üòÖ


[03-Jan-25 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hehe yeah, 450 days ago it was a better bid


[03-Jan-25 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
But I like to keep a lowball bid in for certain things because sometimes someone will just clear out their whole warehouse selling to bids

Hi and welcome @altf4forbetterlife ! AltF4 started on Deimos just recently and got a ADI grant to fill out a SME base there. Please tell us a little about your plans or goals in prosperous universe. And let us know if you have any questions about what OOG has to offer!

@altf4forbetterlife welcome!


[09-Jan-25 01:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
howdy


[09-Jan-25 05:46 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
o7 arch,max,hernanduer,zip ! As arch said, I started a AL SME base @ Deimos yesterday and it's operating atm. As for short-term goal, I'm planning to build a farm base on Promitor and a INC base on Odysseus to produce Carbon for my HQ SME base. Also a FE/STL base will be build on Vulcan recently and the frame will be almost the same as Deimos base. Words above are what I'm doing for sure and further plans still need to be done.


[09-Jan-25 05:46 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
The main reason joining OOG is that I need a community where I can learn and trade and talk üôÇ


[09-Jan-25 05:47 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
and your website is fantastic which is really impressive


[09-Jan-25 05:48 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm new to this game and still not very familiar to the whole production chain network, so I still need to learn and ask some questions before decide longer plan


[09-Jan-25 05:49 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I think that will be all, thanks for asking üôÇ @archielvahr


[09-Jan-25 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's a pretty stretched out plan, you'll be spending a lot of time flying around. Unless you started on Promitor, you won't be able to get a spot there. You'll probably want to use Harmonia and Nascent to keep Antares-centric. Most OOG members only operate in Antares space and while we don't make that a requirement, you often won't find any support outside of ANT


[09-Jan-25 06:00 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
well yeah I've considered harmonia but is that soil fertility acceptable ?


[09-Jan-25 06:00 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
not very sure about that


[09-Jan-25 06:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
best one around


[09-Jan-25 06:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
all of the contracts we do are in AIC so any planets and transaction will be in ANT space


[09-Jan-25 06:02 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
rgr that, Harmonia then üôÇ thanks for hint


[09-Jan-25 06:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I‚Äôm on mobile now but if you want someone can start the trial. Just set the trial role


[09-Jan-25 07:34 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
Yeah I'd like to start. üôÇ


[09-Jan-25 07:34 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I cannot set role by myself right?


[09-Jan-25 07:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nope only someone with moderator perms can


[09-Jan-25 07:43 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
rgr that


[09-Jan-25 07:45 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
actually I've got a question to ask. Unlike EVE Online or other real-economic MMO game, a significant difference in PrUn is the variety of essential consumption is few and due to player base the numbers are also low (ships won't be destroyed, no concept like "ammunition"), which makes me found difficult to decide what to produce. Any suggestions ?


[09-Jan-25 07:46 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
it's like, after step into settlers or higher tier, all products' 7d unit are low


[09-Jan-25 07:47 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so despite STL or AL, I'm not sure whether it's worth to build up huge production chain to produce something that can only sell like 100 or 200 per day


[09-Jan-25 07:48 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
HMS, for example, was my goal. but I've checked CX and it can only go like 200 per day


[09-Jan-25 07:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Pre fabs? Construction materials? Ship repair parts?


[09-Jan-25 07:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
DW? Or RAT?


[09-Jan-25 07:51 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I'll check those, thanks for your suggestions üòç


[09-Jan-25 07:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ofc!


[09-Jan-25 07:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The first 3 might be easier since you make AL


[09-Jan-25 07:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And some of those use AL to make


[09-Jan-25 07:53 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah that will be perfect


[09-Jan-25 07:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can also do MAT AL in a buffer and see what AL is used to make


[09-Jan-25 07:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If that helps


[09-Jan-25 07:55 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
oh wow is a useful command


[09-Jan-25 07:55 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
thx


[09-Jan-25 07:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yup üëç


[09-Jan-25 07:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If you type MAT and then the code for the material of interest you can see how it‚Äôs made, what building it‚Äôs made in, what it can make and what buildings etc


[09-Jan-25 07:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can also click on the squares of the resources and what nots to pull up information on that thing


[09-Jan-25 07:57 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
rgr that !


[09-Jan-25 07:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
o7


[09-Jan-25 08:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
DW / RAT are go to since everyone needs them. Construction with L/R/A fabs. Money printing with IDC. EPO that goes into construction.


[09-Jan-25 08:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
Now you can add into the mix some parts for Gates


[09-Jan-25 10:43 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
Thanks for helping !


[09-Jan-25 10:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
If you wanna get into construction (which basically a money sink for big players) check full chain starting from HCP->C->AL


[09-Jan-25 10:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
See if base has under 15 days ROI and build a chain


[09-Jan-25 10:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
If it doesn‚Äôt, just buy item from the market


[09-Jan-25 10:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
There is more too it, but you will see the pattern yourself


[09-Jan-25 11:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay I got the role  set, sorry about the delay!


[09-Jan-25 11:50 PM] archielvahr#0000

Panda_Derp_Drinking_Animated 

[12-Jan-25 10:20 AM] martin1194#0000
tbh, that is a bad offer.
That is an Arg planet, and the price is lower than the CX bid price.


[12-Jan-25 10:23 AM] max.kalina#0000
In such cases, it is better to place an order with +20-25% from CX price to stimulate someone urgently fulfill it. Also write in planet chat request about this ad.


[12-Jan-25 10:25 AM] martin1194#0000
The only the way can get stuff lower than CX price.
1. That is the production planet. Such as H2O.
2. People don't have any ship to transport them, and they will sell it at lower price in LM.


[12-Jan-25 10:26 AM] donmega1983#0000
uh No. the price is under 14 ‚Ç¨.


[12-Jan-25 10:31 AM] martin1194#0000
Opps. That is not ANT planet. mbmb


[12-Jan-25 10:31 AM] martin1194#0000
Cuz I based on AN1 price. : P


[12-Jan-25 10:32 AM] martin1194#0000
Forgot that is BEN planet. : P


[12-Jan-25 10:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
Your best bet probably would be planet chat


[12-Jan-25 10:32 AM] martin1194#0000

I guess he received loan at the start, maybe COLIQ several times before he find his way


[03-Feb-25 09:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
I believe he's having some sort of seizure


[04-Feb-25 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oof he bit off a lot there


[04-Feb-25 09:14 AM] zipatsu#0000
I'm not sure if it's possible to fill the contract in time even if he did get a full base sponsored so am holding off on paying until I get the H2O first  üòÖ

Hi, member of Parliament at Harmonia.


[04-Feb-25 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hello and welcome, I've seen you around on ADI too!


[04-Feb-25 11:04 AM] martin1194#0000
Appltree23 and I are in Harmonia being member of Parliament.


[04-Feb-25 11:05 AM] martin1194#0000
I sent the link to Appltree23 which you are provided.
He/She happy to join but unsure will have PRO or not in the future.


[04-Feb-25 11:06 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah thats basically my situation


[04-Feb-25 11:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
in about 2 weeks il know for sure if I have pro for 3 months (and maybe longer), or not


[04-Feb-25 11:08 AM] pagy1234#0000
(he)


[04-Feb-25 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hey that sounds great. Usually some level of Pro (or at least basic) is essential, otherwise you can't really work with us or send/receive contracts, so hopefully that works out. But you can totally learn the ropes with a free account. 

I'm guessing you saw our recruiting page already. Do you have any questions about what OOG has to offer? Or about the application process?


[04-Feb-25 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
I see you have two bases already, that's pretty great üòÑ


[04-Feb-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
just one question at the moment; Does OOG function more closely as a group, like with a focus on producing what other poeple need/want you to make then sharing it for low price? Or is it more alone in terms of make what you want, but be useful and contribute to projects?


[04-Feb-25 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
So we give a lot of freedom to our members- you never _need_ to participate in any of our specific programs. Like our auctions/orders - if you prefer to operate at market rates instead of selling at a discount, you can just opt out of that. Our members have a bunch of cooperative projects, Project-6115 in Nyx is open to all members if you want to join, fuel prodeuciton on Romulan, industrial center on IA-151, etc.


[04-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
But, typically if something sells out on the CX, there's probably a source inside OOG who can sell you some, so you've got a lot of resources like that. Plus mentorship and the bank, etc... those are all things you can opt into


[04-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
There's definitely no "hey go do this for the corp".


[04-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you want someone to give you ideas, we can usually brainstorm as a group and come up with ideas


[04-Feb-25 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
And sometimes people have sponsored base options, etc. Or partnerships with combinations of bases that support eachother. But those are pretty freeform when they happen


[04-Feb-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh that sounds pretty awesome, will get back to you on the pro license thing, but until then I must say that I am interested in joining


[04-Feb-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
:D


[04-Feb-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Awesome


[04-Feb-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the public channels are pretty quiet, but keep hanging out here


[04-Feb-25 11:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, I see that on your website it say "Each member will be internally discussed, then a 7 day trial is offered", so lmk if you need any information on what Im doing in the game or whatever and I would be happy to provide


[04-Feb-25 11:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sure. I guess my main question is... do you have any particular plans- things you want to get into producing, things in PRUN that you want to try out, etc


[04-Feb-25 11:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
my super long term goal would be to dominate a single market, simmilar to Kipatsu in H2O or something of the sort. more realistically I would like to expand to making a whole range of consumables, prefereably from scratch, right now I have norwick as my main base with 20 FP's producing DW and RAT (1100 and 450 a day respectively) and plans to expand my harmonia base to make my rat production self sufficent. my next base would hopefully be for H2O to make DW much cheaper to produce and to negate any of the market shenanigans.


[04-Feb-25 11:39 AM] martin1194#0000
It's hard. It is demand & supply issue.


[04-Feb-25 11:40 AM] martin1194#0000
RAT and DW price is going that high.
Because the profit rate isn't high.
Supplier convert production line to other more profit.
Same issue is appear in B fabs, also MCG.


[04-Feb-25 11:41 AM] martin1194#0000
Not the market shenanigans.

DW and COF not that profit right now.

Abandon DW and RAT.


[04-Feb-25 11:55 AM] martin1194#0000
I think if u producing DW. Buy H2O right now


[04-Feb-25 11:55 AM] martin1194#0000
H2O price will go higher


[04-Feb-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
already stocked up last night


[04-Feb-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Feb-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
could abandon DW end of next week, cannot abandon RAT for at least 30 days since I have too much stock of ALG and VEG


[04-Feb-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
roughly 8 days worth of H2O in storages


[04-Feb-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
about 14k


[04-Feb-25 11:58 AM] martin1194#0000

H2O price. D:

I actually cant buy more


[04-Feb-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
but once I expand my harmonia farm I can start producing HER and make FIM instead of DW


[04-Feb-25 12:01 PM] martin1194#0000
I am always import RAT for FIM production, you can sell me all of RAT at ask price if u need money emergency. üòõ


[04-Feb-25 12:01 PM] lancercaster#0000
Do you remember to add PG to your water?


[04-Feb-25 12:01 PM] martin1194#0000
PG not that profit for DW.


[04-Feb-25 12:02 PM] lancercaster#0000
I for one could not live without plastics in my water.


[04-Feb-25 12:02 PM] pagy1234#0000
I dont do that currently, may need to consider it. last time I did math for the difference was before all this H2O craziness


[04-Feb-25 12:02 PM] martin1194#0000
add PG = 2times more

[04-Feb-25 12:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
well, the time difference is what did it for me last time iirc, margin is better with PG but you just get way less money in total


[04-Feb-25 12:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
nvm


[04-Feb-25 12:03 PM] martin1194#0000
This is when H2O is 50


[04-Feb-25 12:04 PM] martin1194#0000
You can use this website for calculate


[04-Feb-25 12:04 PM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Feb-25 12:05 PM] lancercaster#0000
Oh. I guess the PG recipe is worth less than it used to be.


[04-Feb-25 12:05 PM] martin1194#0000
Cuz DW price very high. H2O still cheap.


[04-Feb-25 12:06 PM] pagy1234#0000
if H2O price goes up more, PG will be better than without


[04-Feb-25 12:06 PM] pagy1234#0000
will look at buying some PG


[04-Feb-25 12:06 PM] lancercaster#0000
I guess once Boucher is drained dry.


[04-Feb-25 12:08 PM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Feb-25 12:08 PM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Feb-25 12:10 PM] martin1194#0000
What is ur sell order?


[04-Feb-25 12:10 PM] martin1194#0000

oh yeah, I can stock up some rat and sell to you if you need? I usually sell at ask anyways.


[04-Feb-25 12:25 PM] martin1194#0000
Yes, of course.


[04-Feb-25 12:26 PM] martin1194#0000
cuz DW and RAT is fit to my production line


[04-Feb-25 12:28 PM] martin1194#0000
also it can help you grow faster. :goodluck:


[04-Feb-25 12:28 PM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Feb-25 12:33 PM] martin1194#0000
But you no need to fulfill all cuz maybe will have to change if the FIM not that profit.
But at least currently, the FIM is crazy in the entire universe.


[04-Feb-25 12:38 PM] martin1194#0000
Don't hesitate to sell me if you need money quickly. : D

As Archiel said, we have the /order system where you can request internal prices for anything you need actually. building MAT's, HQ MAT's. Most will fill your internal order under CX bid. 
For your H2O production plans, consider SE-110c. It looks far, but the yield is insane. You can post shipping ads if you need your ships elsewhere.


[04-Feb-25 02:50 PM] roche3950#0000
I may actually dismantle my ISA base soon


[04-Feb-25 02:50 PM] roche3950#0000
Would be happy to help you get set up Appl


[04-Feb-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
You get 200 PIOs when you start a base, the rest will come when the next workforce cycles


[04-Feb-25 04:30 PM] martin1194#0000
i see, that why 200 only :3


[04-Feb-25 04:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  That's how the game works. And only PIOs. But those 200 come with the base, so they get added to the planet's POPI report

oh nice, had a look at ISA, yield is very nice but ROI is still not amazing, 35 day for max area base, but something more reasonable for me like 6x RIG's 2x HB1's and 1x STO has a 57 day ROI


[04-Feb-25 08:23 PM] pagy1234#0000
might have to hold off on that for a bit longer


[04-Feb-25 08:24 PM] pagy1234#0000
but lets see, if H2O goes up any further it will probably make sense to do it.

that would be great, will need to check my options further though before I accept anything

[04-Feb-25 08:29 PM] roche3950#0000
Shoot me a DM; I'm gonna be engaged in something here for a couple hours and will get back to you when I can


[04-Feb-25 10:45 PM] bookliko#0000
2 things: for a base on ICA you need INS and HSE, which makes it expensivem BUT: You need to factor in cheaper construction mats due to not having to buy at CX price (butbat OOG instead)  Prunplanner gives you the option to define "empire prices" option to evaluate ROI with realistically (will post later where to do this)
Secondly, you can factor in that you produce your own DW and RAT. This has a high impact as well. You tell prunplanner this as well. It kind of iterates in a positive way. Will make more sense when you start playing with these numbers in pruneplanner


[04-Feb-25 11:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah I know how to change the CX settings in prunplanner, I have a market set up for the ADI internal market than I use sometimes, dont know how to make it calculate that I make my own DW and RAT though, I assume its just another change in the CX settings?


[04-Feb-25 11:43 PM] pagy1234#0000
once I figure out what exactly i'm building il send you a dm üëç

it iterates  pretty nicely to lower production costs

Should mention that i produce my own RAT input at HYF with also own production of NS and LST. Only missing a good yield base of N to have the full chain.

I think might be Pioneer


[05-Feb-25 09:37 AM] martin1194#0000
Because Pioneer cost is base on RAT+DW+OVE+COF+PWO
Any of these material price changed at CX, your cost also change.


[05-Feb-25 09:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
OHHH

Cx for DW is ~100

I was thinking of H2O lmao


[05-Feb-25 09:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You have a lower buy price for your RATs overriding the 165/u price that is on the CX


[05-Feb-25 09:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
That lower price makes it cheaper to feed your guys lowering your production cost


[05-Feb-25 09:52 AM] pagy1234#0000

We are definitely always interested in more ship builders though


[05-Feb-25 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
How it has been working lately is that I've been buying components from people in the corp and selling the ships as complete packages


[05-Feb-25 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
It is always a challenge to balance all the items needed, so members often also sell their ship components on the open market


[05-Feb-25 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the new HCBs will be needed for a while, and we always need more ASM production in general. My FTL engine supplies are dwindling a little. We'll have to check in and see if we need more people in that area.


[05-Feb-25 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also, have you checked out the ADI program yet, @shokanshi ? They offer grants that are super helpful getting more bases in ANT

Hey @shokanshi  and @pagy1234 , if you are both interested in joining, I think we could start your trials! I know you don't have Pro/basic yet, Appltree, but since you're essentially "pro" for your trial, I think it should work out okay.


[06-Feb-25 03:33 PM] shokanshi#0000
Yeah I am interested


[06-Feb-25 03:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Great! Welcome to your trial! The trial lasts one week, and as a trial member you have access to the whole discord and all of the services. So check out the auctions and orders, plus the ‚Å†shareholders-welcome  message. So the actual in-game invite comes after the trial, if we both feel like it's a good fit for each other.

Ayo, how big of a factor is weight for fuel consumption?

On ships


[11-Mar-25 05:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds pretty good to me, we're based in ANT but it's common for folks to have one or two bases outside of ANT (especially their starter)


[11-Mar-25 05:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
have you had a chance to check out ADI? And possibly get a grant from there?


[11-Mar-25 05:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
In theory it does matter how full the fuel tank is.. but in reality it's super minor and barely makes a difference

I did notice the programme. But not sure of the plan. I guess i can run the same with any goals the corp has?


[11-Mar-25 08:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think that's true. We are pretty free-form, so while we have group projects in OOG, we don't really push any specific goals


[11-Mar-25 08:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
And usually the group projects are just when some member wants to get something specific done and needs some extra help


[11-Mar-25 08:55 PM] jerry.9790#0000
Ok. My next base plan is some orchards in Lemura.


[11-Mar-25 08:55 PM] archielvahr#0000

The trial lasts one week, and as a trial member you have access to the whole discord and all of the services. So check out the auctions and orders, plus the ‚Å†shareholders-welcome  message. So the actual in-game invite comes after the trial, if we both feel like it's a good fit for each other.

It's been longer than a week, so probably not. If you haven't gotten an invite yet and you want to join still someone just needs to send one to you an invite in game

We tend to forget about when the trial ends for people üòÖ 

I probably should add a command for these to the bot so it's easier to keep track of them :think:

Did you have any long term plans, where you might want to be once you've got a few more bases set up? Or specific industries of interest?

Hello!!!

‚úåÔ∏è 

[26-Apr-25 06:47 AM] swatacular#0000
Hi all! I‚Äôm going to give a little introduction to get the convo started.
I‚Äôm an old vet returning from a few year absence.

I was a part of the GTU although I never partook that much because I was based in ANT and they were all based in MOR.

I was heavily involved in shipbuilding and still have a lot of shipbuilding materials, although having a few really spread out bases made managing my own bases a real chore.
I have a decent stockpile of old ship parts and cash, and I‚Äôm very interested in reviving a few bases.

I used to be a big spreadsheet simulator guy but now having gotten married and have 2 kids. I‚Äôll be a little less so, and as such I‚Äôm going to need help to really play as effectively as I‚Äôd like to. (Contributing bases to projects instead of just trying to run my own)

I saw there‚Äôs this thing called Gateways? That looks super interesting to me. More because of the long term reliability of it. I‚Äôd love to contribute what I can especially considering ownership shares are given out.

[26-Apr-25 06:52 AM] max.kalina#0000
Welcome!


[26-Apr-25 06:56 AM] max.kalina#0000
I guess you need a colossal volume on Fabs and construction materials to repair all you bases, I had the same when returned last yearüòé


[26-Apr-25 06:57 AM] swatacular#0000
Yeah. And also a total base plan overhaul if I want to change anything


[26-Apr-25 06:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Gateways are an upcoming thing the devs have planned, not in the game yet but well on the way for a couple of months now. Archiel and OOG have a big spreadsheet for all the information about the gateways if you are interested, materials are already being collected to build up the first few since they are massive undertakings (~300mil each)


[26-Apr-25 06:58 AM] swatacular#0000
As an example, I have a lot of ship parts but only 1 wcb and 1 LCB ship. I was about to get a second. I have to decide if it‚Äôs worth spending my limited (but substantial) funds on a ship


[26-Apr-25 06:59 AM] swatacular#0000
I just love the idea of a passive paycheck that I can collect when I‚Äôm busy with life. But I understand that playing bases will always be better than anything I can get passively


[26-Apr-25 07:00 AM] swatacular#0000
I mean my net worth is what. Maybe 50-70m with 40m Liquid?
That amounts to a 10% contribution to a gateway or a full restore of all my bases with about 20mm leftover for input buffers and a ship


[26-Apr-25 07:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
If you have the ships parts already then it could be a solid idea to make a 3rd ship, but if you dont need the shipping capacity then it would probably be better to sell the parts and get some cash to get running again


[26-Apr-25 07:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
How many bases are you at? I assume your worth is only low because of base degradation?


[26-Apr-25 07:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh wth, this is the OOG general chatüòÖ

[26-Apr-25 07:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
Mobile discord is so disorienting


[26-Apr-25 07:07 AM] evov#0000
I think it's a fairly interesting and dynamic time to rejoin the game. New ships have been made available fairly recently (5k5k), gateways are on the horizon. Market maker changes are shaking up a lot of area's, and I suspect the pop upkeep changes might open up some new markets/materials.

From my perspective at least, the last couple months has felt like a burst changes and shifting balance.

Yeah I noticed


[26-Apr-25 07:09 AM] swatacular#0000
Like I have a base on Malahat full idc edc and I kinda needed it to make WAI, but now I need to know if I should rebuild it or not. Cause running at 33% production i don‚Äôt think is worth the consumables


[26-Apr-25 07:11 AM] pagy1234#0000
Incase you havent seen, IDC is the hardest hit MM item. Unless you need it for something (probably the WAI) its not too good anymore to have it around

[26-Apr-25 07:11 AM] pagy1234#0000
Although MEA and FIM prices calmed down so its not terrible anymore


[26-Apr-25 07:29 AM] swatacular#0000
I was all set up for a mediocre AIR base


[26-Apr-25 07:29 AM] swatacular#0000
But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to really handle it without Corp help


[26-Apr-25 07:30 AM] swatacular#0000
It looks like AIR is where it‚Äôs at though, so I should really prioritize getting that running


[26-Apr-25 07:31 AM] swatacular#0000
I think there‚Äôs one ingredient that I don‚Äôt have any big source of. So I‚Äôd probably want to test out the OOG order system for that


[26-Apr-25 07:31 AM] swatacular#0000
Is the order/auction system used a lot?


[26-Apr-25 07:36 AM] swatacular#0000
I feel like I should set up the EDC IDC base even if it‚Äôs going to get hit simply because of the WAI needs and because MEA and FIM prices are going to tank with people killing their IDC EDC bases. But that‚Äôs a feeling and not backed by real spreadsheets


[26-Apr-25 07:36 AM] swatacular#0000
Unless corp has decent access to WAI


[26-Apr-25 07:41 AM] swatacular#0000
I have 8 bases with 9 permits. And I had never done much repairs so my bases were not really paying for themselves when I played. (Which I didn‚Äôt realize) so I was very slowly increasing by building new bases but not really just making tons of money


[26-Apr-25 07:49 AM] swatacular#0000
It was a real struggle to keep bases working and I never knew why


[26-Apr-25 07:50 AM] evov#0000
I do find it interesting how many people are looking to start making AIR. I wonder how many people have worked through the numbers themselves to decide if it's a good idea... or if people are just following a ranked list posted by someone else without actually knowing what their margins will be.


[26-Apr-25 07:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
Why would you do homework if someone did it for you kinda thing üòÖ


[26-Apr-25 07:51 AM] swatacular#0000
I was making air before it was cool


[26-Apr-25 07:52 AM] swatacular#0000
I was making air back when edc and idc was like 16k or whatever in 2022


[26-Apr-25 07:52 AM] marat_sh#0000
I‚Äôve started to make BAC for people who gonna go for AIR, but quickly realized how easy it is to make BAC so it‚Äôs probably gonna get overproduced


[26-Apr-25 08:01 AM] swatacular#0000
I‚Äôm getting excited to join you guys (if I‚Äôm approved)


[26-Apr-25 08:01 AM] swatacular#0000
Cause it‚Äôs so different playing with people that have bases nearby


[26-Apr-25 08:01 AM] swatacular#0000
I can tell from just this one conversation


[26-Apr-25 08:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, tbh the ranking list is a bit misleading, I went through a couple today, and turns out that some of the higher up ones are actually pretty bad in practice


[26-Apr-25 08:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
The inputs are not at all calculated in that equation that made the list, like how often are you going to have a full base of 1 high teir product right?


[26-Apr-25 08:24 AM] bookliko#0000
Oh yeah, it's very helpfull. Once you start the trial, you'll see the channels and what people are offering/asking 

Oh and welcome!!


[26-Apr-25 08:26 AM] swatacular#0000
Can someone explain to me the benefits of being a governor? Like what does being a shareholder mean in terms of payments? Can people make their main livelihood off it or does it barely pay for the costs of being the governor in the first place? I‚Äôm looking for a candid response


[26-Apr-25 08:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Very few benefits, you gotta deal with all the upkeep and stuff, and in 99% of cases you make no money. Govenors responsibility is to maintain planet happiness, pop, and upkeep, then reimburse themselves from taxes.


[26-Apr-25 08:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Not sure what you mean by shareholder


[26-Apr-25 08:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
member of parliment?


[26-Apr-25 08:30 AM] swatacular#0000
Well. I thought OOG was a group of governors that get paid dividends from taxes. Because I thought taxes go to the corp not the individual.
So i called these people who get dividends shareholders


[26-Apr-25 08:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh that corp shareholder thing, tbh I have no idea what its for, like once a week I get a "payout" of 180AIC


[26-Apr-25 08:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
but the planet taxes stay within the planet


[26-Apr-25 08:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
corp doesnt have anything to do with it


[26-Apr-25 08:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
it used to be a thing before goverment rework


[26-Apr-25 08:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
now it's transparent and dividends are just a remnants of forgotten era

[26-Apr-25 08:33 AM] swatacular#0000
Sweet


[26-Apr-25 08:35 AM] swatacular#0000
Can I run a planet how I want like by chatting in the planetary chat or are they gonna kick me out if I raise taxes above 2%


[26-Apr-25 08:36 AM] swatacular#0000
In other words. If I want to make profit off being a governor is that a thing or not really


[26-Apr-25 08:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
mostly not since people will see how much you spend on things


[26-Apr-25 08:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
you can "make money" by using gov items that you produce yourself


[26-Apr-25 08:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
you can do what you want (probably) as long as you dont run into that Master_Demon guy üòÇ


[26-Apr-25 08:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
that guy despises taxes lmao


[26-Apr-25 08:41 AM] marat_sh#0000
I pay like 50k total on all of my bases üíÄ


[26-Apr-25 08:41 AM] marat_sh#0000
in comparison to mil of profits


[26-Apr-25 08:42 AM] marat_sh#0000
I 100% sure random Joe from Deimos smelting plant pays more taxes than me


[26-Apr-25 08:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
im just under 50k aswell lol


[26-Apr-25 08:55 AM] bookliko#0000
Its a democracy mate, people will vote based on their interests. If you can convince the voters that taxes are good,then go for it üòÖ

Hey welcome! üòÑ


[26-Apr-25 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the meta around governing changed a lot since you started


[26-Apr-25 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Boo has a awesome writeup about the mechanics of it on the webpage. But the meta is still: governor is responsible for everything, the MPs might help, but you probably have to ping them. Things are usually pretty stable for incumbents, usually changes only happen when a governor gets burned out and someone new swaps in


[26-Apr-25 10:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
So if you're interested in a trial, it lasts one week, and as a trial member you have access to the whole discord and all of the services. Once you're in, check out the auctions and orders, plus the ‚Å†shareholders-welcome  message. The actual in-game invite comes after the trial, if we both feel like it's a good fit for each other.


[26-Apr-25 11:04 AM] swatacular#0000
Do I need an ingame invite? I kinda inherited a guild (I‚Äôm 100% owner) that has a HQ on Circe


[26-Apr-25 11:06 AM] swatacular#0000
I would like a trial, and I have a few questions that may be suited better in DMs


[26-Apr-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Welcome to the trial!


[26-Apr-25 02:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's good enough for me, hehe


[26-Apr-25 02:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
So yeah after a week the in-game invite will come


[27-Apr-25 12:57 AM] allocater#0000
We run a bunch of edc/idc corp bases on malahat, so you can get a full repair package and a 50d supply package for your base locally, by sending the contract for it to sidepipe or me, or requesting the needed materials on the LM. Price is 14mil for repair and 10mil for supply for 100% IDC. Discount if you have a percentage of EDC.


[27-Apr-25 08:00 AM] bookliko#0000
Can you tell me/us more about this Corp base? How does that work? The only thing I see is the few hundred AIC dividend. how do we all benefit from all that income?


[27-Apr-25 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
Basically, the program is funded by deposits in the OOG bank (which you can see in the sheet). You get a base for free and a cut of every IDC/EDC you produce. In exchange we take and sell the data cores, and supply your base with free repairs and mats


[27-Apr-25 08:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
And the profits are used to pay interest on the deposits in the bank


[27-Apr-25 08:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
@allocater can correct me if anything about that is changing since the MM changes are upcoming

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Apr-25 08:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
(And we can talk about specific amounts in the private channels üòÑ)


[27-Apr-25 08:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm 99% sure the dividend everyone gets is a bug at this point. The way it used to work before the politics update is that all the tax income from every planet with an OOG governor would get split among all corp members. So newer members would get a boost from the dividend, and older members would pay out of pocket to run their planets.


[27-Apr-25 08:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
We probably need to update some of those posts someday üòÖ


[27-Apr-25 08:53 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's long gone... I joined about two weeks before that went away early last year. üôÇ


[27-Apr-25 08:53 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, since then ADI has upped there grant from 200k to 1m AIC now... which is a pretty heathly jump start before you dip in to any other kind of assistance or borrowing.


[27-Apr-25 09:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
And if you do need assistance and borrowing, we have 0% interest loans üòé


[27-Apr-25 05:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah ‚Äúdividends‚Äù are the old system and I agree that there is some sort of bug where old money isn‚Äôt removed as the dividends are issued. But it‚Äôs a few hundred aic so no one cares.


[27-Apr-25 05:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you do plan for WAI make sure to also build the SE and SDs
