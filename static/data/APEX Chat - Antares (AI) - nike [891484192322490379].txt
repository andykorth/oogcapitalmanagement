**Madnewmy**:	anyone got TRUs around?


[07-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaptainB**:	Just started making them here on nike, How many do you need and can you wait a day or two for them?


[07-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaptainB**:	I also have some in my WAR at ANT and 8 on PHO


[07-Oct-21 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	yea I just need 5 atm for my HQ


[07-Oct-21 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	and probs a large load after

**Madnewmy**:	perf :)


[14-Oct-21 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broken_Marrow**:	Question....do you guys sell your LST, or use it for other products? The Hortus and Antares CXL's don't seem to have enough demand to be worth shipping even 1 EXT's output on the regular...


[14-Oct-21 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I use it for prefabs and flx, then sell my excess.


[14-Oct-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	I usually ship my excess to deimos and sell it there


[14-Oct-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but I run deimos to and from nike a lot


[14-Oct-21 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I use all my LST


[14-Oct-21 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I find LST too heavy to haul for profit, so i just kind of try to balance it out so i dont have to ship it anywhere other than straight to deimos


[14-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	i exclusively buy LST from others


[19-Oct-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	I use a ridiculous amount of LST and I sell an even more ridiculous amount of LST on Nike LM


[19-Oct-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	I make 700ish LST per day


[19-Oct-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	shipping it is impossible until I get one of the 1000/3000 ships


[19-Oct-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	so I just sell on LM


[22-Oct-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	anyone got PE for sale?

[14-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It's going to be about 1-2 months before we get techs where we need them


[14-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	PAR parts in on their way to hortus, I think theres a good chance PAR will be stood up by the next POPR


[14-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Don't hesitate to add more Tech jobs all, we'll grow into it


[14-Nov-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DLR**:	Hello, friendly people of Nike. I see many familiar Phobro names here.


[19-Nov-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The rest of the PAR components (HAB, SOI, and BDE) are in flight ETA 1.5 days.  It should arrive just before POPR


[19-Nov-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I only have 100 extra SOI to put into the consumables.  I'll fill the DW right away too.  This will kickstart some effects


[19-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I believe it takes a full week before it begins to turn on, so we'll have 7 days to gather mats to feed it.  I think that if we can provide all the mats right off the bat it will mega boost the comfort and raise tech happiness much quicker.


[19-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I think we can get a DEC easy enough, but I cannot get FOD or PFE at all, i just have no capacity to do that.


[19-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Anyone have any hookups for FOD or PFE?


[19-Nov-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**juzek14**:	I understand the bonus for PAR should kick in as soon as the last of the consumption queue lapses


[19-Nov-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**juzek14**:	so it's ether going to kick in in 1d or 4d

**Nirces**:	Was curious, generating a fair amount of excess AL on Deimos and making regular trips between Deimos,Nike and Ant. selling produce with some excess LST back to Deimos. I will start putting up the excess AL at average price on LM rather than ship to ANT


[27-Dec-21 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jan-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ColonelError**:	Hello my fellow Nike citizens. With OOG building our HQ here, we’d like to take an active role in ensuring that Nike runs as well as possible, and that our taxes are used effectively to improve the planet. With this in mind, I would like to announce that I will be running for Governor in the next couple days as we complete the Administration center.


[16-Jan-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ColonelError**:	I will be running on behalf of OOG, and will remain a shareholder in that corp. I intend to keep in-depth accounting of the money that is being brought in and how it’s spent, and will make those books available. OOG will commit to good faith management of tax revenue and the maintenance and development of Nike’s infrastructure.


[16-Jan-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-22 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	I have 3 WEL running on MHL. But 200 MHL are several weeks worth of production


[26-Jan-22 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	To be fair I would need them over several weeks and after crunching some numbers I need just 144 plus a few for repairs


[26-Jan-22 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	I will put in a WEL and start producing then aswell as putting in a buy order on the cx in the next week or so

**DLR**:	Hello Nike citizens. I am happy to announce that my first act as governor is to extend the engineer immigration program by 3 days, for 80k AIC. This is expected to bring an additional 50 engineers on top of the outgoing governor's program which is still in effect for 3 days.


[19-Mar-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	why wouldnt you just do education, it'd bring like 750 engineers


[19-Mar-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	I didnt know the education program would have that large of an effect, but realy this many engineers seems excessive right now, and I wouldnt want to risk causing a shortage of technicians or settlers.


[19-Mar-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Im open to running different programs in the future instead of the immigration one, it does seem inefficient in comparison.


[20-Mar-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Mar-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	it's one thing to have a few less pio's on deimos and have to buy your ALO or AL from the market, it's another thing to be out 5 PP3s worth of productivity

**DLR**:	Hello Nike, I have activated the Family Support III program, which will provide +20% growth to pioneer/settler/technician populations on planet.


[05-Apr-22 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Also, I am considering activating the +20% worker happiness boost in 7 days. This is open for discussion, as it would likely cause warehouses to fill up, or input materials to be consumed more rapidly than expected.


[06-Apr-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Apr-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Not intentionally :)


[10-Apr-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I could be wrong, but I think that Family Support III didn't do anything at all because nothing is over 70% happiness


[10-Apr-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Hmm..


[10-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We believe that's how it works, yes.


[10-Apr-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	I think there has not been enough time? There is another happiness boost event queued after the current family support, I think we should see the full effect by next report


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No. The program on the report is only affected by the one running when the report triggers


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	So nothing more will happen with the family support program


[10-Apr-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Does this imply that a program which starts and concludes entirely within a 7 day cycle has no impact?


[11-Apr-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Population reports trigger every 7 days, so you always get one and only one program per report


[11-Apr-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's a strange system to make it run on a timer, not directly attached to the report.

[09-Jun-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Can you elaborate? What program? How will it help bring more ENG?


[10-Jun-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	There's currently demand for 11 Engineers on Nike. With another planetary festivies II, you can expect at least that many to spawn. So assuming the Nike treasury is pretty slim, whoever wants those few extra engineers probably should stump up the small amount of cash needed for the program


[10-Jun-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**YJ14**:	OOG is working to get more infrastructure built to accommodate the sudden need for ENG/TECH, I've put just shy of a million AIC of my own money into it over the last month or so. The ART will be complete soon and I will continue to run the highest education programs. I'm not sure where all the demand came from seemingly overnight but we are acting to fix it.


[21-Oct-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We recently upgraded the SST and INF and almost have the HAB to upgrade the PAR as well. We are already seeing an increase in technician and engineer numbers and will see that accelerate as the new upgrades come online.

[21-Oct-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StrykerSnow**:	OOG talks big on paper and no doubt contributes a lot of resources to upgrade planets. But if they aren’t keeping their members to a standard of activity to press buttons once a week to start weekly programs and supply upkeeps, then what is the point? Let someone else Governor and just donate the upgrades.

**Rannepear**:	I dont think current gov. activity has been sufficient, regardless of how awesome OOG may be or not be. Programs running late for example (you can see programs not having been run on pop reports during current tenure). Been a shortage for a while, too.

**Churaviis**:	You would need to raise taxes quite a bit to pay for an equivalent level of upkeep and upgrades to what we've provided


[21-Oct-22 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**valdin98**:	No argument on that, but why can't your guy push the buttons on time? I think that's what Rannepear is getting at.


[21-Oct-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Also, it seems politically self serving to say “look how benevolent we are by donating upgrades and upkeep! Taxes could never afford this!”, when you literally have the power to set those taxes to pay for those costs.


[21-Oct-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Well yes, we have refrained from raising taxes even though we would be totally justified in doing so


[21-Oct-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I would happily vote for the pro-tax candidate, all else being equal.


[21-Oct-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	balanced budgets are good in video games too!


[21-Oct-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	“I say, I think your .03 cent tax does not go too far enough”


[21-Oct-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Imo, just be transparent with income and expenditures, and the rest is butter, bby.


[21-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We make a lot of money from our high-tier production chains, that's been the main motivation behind upgrading all the infrastructure. The risk of not having enough workers and slowing our production and expansion plans for even a week is far more expensive than upkeep or taxes by an order of magnitude. That's where the real benefit of governorship comes from, in not having to worry about a penny-pinching governor stiffing our workers.


[21-Oct-22 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Don’t vote for penny pinching governors then?


[21-Oct-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but I think someone said earlier. Not pressing the 2 buttons required to activate education programs or whatever program to maintain upkeep is pretty unacceptable.


[21-Oct-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	At least anyone can donate upkeep. No one except the Governor can activate those programs


[21-Oct-22 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Worker happiness is cumulative so it's hard to know who's a penny pinching governor or not until they've let things crumble for a month and even once you get it back it's another month to get things going again.


[21-Oct-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Do the fulfillment numbers not reflect upkeep being provided?


[21-Oct-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	for the pop satisfaction stats?


[21-Oct-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That should let you loosely monitor, at a glance, the upkeep being provided, not to mention general happiness, within a week or two POPR cycle, and either speak with the Governor, or import some upkeeps


[21-Oct-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Workers immigrate or emmigrate based on happiness. Happiness is based on upkeep fulfillment for the last 4 weeks with a bias towards more recent weeks.


[21-Oct-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Minus unemployment, of course


[21-Oct-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**jelutz77**:	My school district was in a situation where they hadn't passed a funding levy in 30 years. They were staring into financial emergency and couldn't get people to vote for the levy. I told them to make the case: tell them how our school compares to others in quality and financing. Then show them how grim the books are. Then told them how to target their mailer without illegally using school records to do it. They did it, and passed their first levy in 30 years. It goes to show that most people don't mind ponying up more money if they know that it's being put to good use.

**Swatacular**:	l'll be submitting a plan for infustructure before the election is over


[22-Oct-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	if OOG would like to claim that "This is their home too" and they donate all kinds of funds, I will be extremely happy to have their aid in acquiring the needed infustructure from them, and they remain free to donate if they so choose. Once the population is under control, if they would like to run again for the maintenance mode, that is fine with me, we should have good people running in elections.


[22-Oct-22 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Have our aid? We already upgraded the SST, INF and have already donated almost all the MATs for a PAR and ART with the final ones coming soon. YJ14 donated a ton of mats and coordinated with Knarfaction to get the rest for the ART. Even if you win you won't need any aid to get the needed infrastructure because it wil already be done. The credit goes to us and Knarfaction.


[22-Oct-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Maybe best in the future to be transparent then. Other govs give updates after pop reports. We hear nought a peep and see a gov with activity rating of C and programs being run.


[22-Oct-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Oct-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	anyone who has voted for the new guy, take a look through the contribution records for the inf and COGC and consider your vote carefully - your allowed to change it


[23-Oct-22 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Taxes are evenly distributed within the corp, and it is a big cost for the governor himself to bear all the expenses.


[23-Oct-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	That's why other people in OOG will donate.


[23-Oct-22 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	The ART lvl 1 + UTS i just finished was also paid by OOG :)


[23-Oct-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Its one thing to be using the taxes to upkeep, Its another thing to use the taxes to increase and provide more than the bare minimum. I am simply aiming to be an individual person who has a single responsibility for a single planet, Instead of a large scale corporation that loses some efficiency due to the several planets being managed. OOG will get its fair share (if not even more) by selling needed parts to the Nike Governorship.


[23-Oct-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Managing a planet requires enough experience, financial resources, transportation capacity and energy. As the headquarters of nike OOG, we have the will and ability to manage nike well. The last term was unexpected. Our members were on vacation, but we also made efforts to upgrade the infrastructure.


[23-Oct-22 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Members, plural, on vacation? I think most people's concern seems to be only one member, the governor, who could not take the time to start a education program, that only he can start, in the middle of a 1.5 month(and growing) long shortage of Techs and Engineers.


[23-Oct-22 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It just seems to me, regardless of planet or other background info, a Governor must prioritize the well being of their planet above all else and provide a minimum of attention. YJ14 failed in that responsibility, which to me, says its time for a fresh face.


[23-Oct-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think everyone here can plainly see the enormity of OOG's contributions in infrastructure upkeep and upgrades, as seems to be their self set goal in PrUn. I call on all OOG, as I did on my planet when I took over its Governorship, to continue their mission of ensuring quality candidates are presented for all necessary planets, and whoever the governor is, to work with them for the best management possible, for the good of all players.


[23-Oct-22 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And should Swatacular win this election cycle and fail in his responsibility, I hope he is as swiftly replaced. But until then, good luck and thank you for taking on the task.


[23-Oct-22 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	If someone accuses us of profiting from taxes by not upgrading projects. I have to say that Nike's tax revenue cannot maintain its maintenance, let alone upgrade. The cost of infrastructure construction this time is equivalent to all taxes for more than five terms. I hope that those who are successfully elected will not pass on the cost to others by raising tax rates or not maintaining facilities. After all, infrastructure upgrading has been completed in our term of office. As for the problems arising from this term of office, I believe they will not occur next time. We have done a lot, but we were wrong only once. Some people say a lot but do nothing. The donation records are open and transparent


[23-Oct-22 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Our members even help governors share the cost of infrastructure maintenance on a planet like Heph where we don't have governors


[23-Oct-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You keep saying "We". I do not believe anyone is here charging OOG with wrong-doing. The issue is YJ14. OOG has not failed. YJ14 has failed. And since this elected started, he has only posted like once in this chat vs everyone else posting 10x as much for him.


[23-Oct-22 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If OOG or anyone else, from any corp, had presented another candidate, I'd be as likely to vote for them as Swatacular


[23-Oct-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Swatacular has been lying by saying that "the previous gov hasn't been contributing to the planetary infrastructure" in private messages to people. To make something clear - OOG as a corporation has contributed the vast majority of materials and upkeep as a corporation to Nike since we've taken governmentship of the planet. We are more than happy to support candidates outside of OOG if they show promise, knowledge and integrity but at this moment Swatacular is not showing any of that. We want ANT to grow as a strong region with veteran players leading it through their logistics, their corp mates and their bank accounts, not lies and underhanded tactics.


[24-Oct-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	There's also the need to set the record straight regarding the current governor of Nike. Yes, there was a mistake in the last period, but look back at months of OOG running the planet and see the massive investment we have put in terms of materials and money to grow the planet and ensure that you all have the needed population to continue your growth. Let's make sure one mistake won't be used as an excuse to wipe all that progress, and let's not put the noose around someone's neck over a single mistake. We simply can't support someone thats running on the platform of backhanded lies and inexperience.


[24-Oct-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	If we go head to head in a political debate here we can talk around in circles about what you define as “needed population”


[24-Oct-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	regarding the “lies” I said “the previous Governor hasn’t contributed” this is simply an observation based on the names seen in the log and the lack of happiness and programs. Not an attempt to throw dirt where it doesn’t belong.


[24-Oct-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Most the names in the log are OOG members, I myself upgraded the SST and INF


[24-Oct-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	All corp members receive a portion of the tax revenue so we all contribute to our planets


[24-Oct-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	My biggest concern is that your accusation shows you don't know how governing corporations work


[24-Oct-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	There simply is not enough infrastructure being built to supply the needs of the planet. An automated corporate system will be significantly different than a independent Governor willing to outsource parts to bidders.


[24-Oct-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	OOG, as a bidder, will continue to receive funds from Nike via payments for infrastructure, fabs, and upkeep


[24-Oct-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Buddy, we've seen the messages you've been sending. If you do look at the logs, it's mainly OOG contributing.

[24-Oct-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	if you have some good reasons to explain why <70% is a good number to be at I’m all ears


[24-Oct-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	To get happiness up we need like 4 more buildings built, at least.


[24-Oct-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	According to the calculator that’s on the discord


[24-Oct-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	So why not raise the taxes above penny pinching and get it done?


[24-Oct-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It depends on what you are referring to.


[24-Oct-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	in my experience, the strategy that many people seem to go for is to plan around using education/immigration programs to get the population you need, with extra upkeep items to support the happiness to get to that point


[24-Oct-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	That sounds like a way to get the pop that you as a single player needs, but not enough to give everyone plenty of opportunity


[24-Oct-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and then once you are in the neighborhood if appropriate population numbers, you reduce to bare minimum inputs for upkeep and use festivity programs to maintain happiness, as festivities programs each week are MASSIVELY cheaper than upkeeps for every building, even the cheapest of upkeeps for each one


[24-Oct-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	That’s great! And right now we are way under water.


[24-Oct-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Agreed. Which is why the solution is to run education programs and pump extra short term upkeep to maintain happiness


[24-Oct-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	you should really only upgrade actual infrastructure to the level that you can maintain >50% happiness with the cheapest inputs


[24-Oct-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	in concert with festivities


[24-Oct-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	POPR infra is millions


[24-Oct-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and the upkeep is 100’s of k per month


[24-Oct-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	a festivity is like 30-40k


[24-Oct-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	for 20% happiness across the board. It’s just way more economical to short term pump the education programs. And upkeep to spike pop when you are short, and then return to festivities and minimal inputs


[24-Oct-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	That's literally what we're in the middle of doing right now, my UPF is making more HAB we speak

**RiseofFilth**:	Well, to be clear, I’m not doubting OOG’s corporate handling of upgrades and upkeep


[24-Oct-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	just YJ14’s activity and lack of pressing buttons and keeping programs running


[24-Oct-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But, that is all I will say, for fear of saying the same thing for the 5th time


[24-Oct-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Just wanted to explain the upkeep/program mechanics and strategy that seems most popular and cost effective


[24-Oct-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And now, back to your regular programming of fart and piss jokes


[24-Oct-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Lol, gottem


[24-Oct-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	“When is a door not a door?”


[24-Oct-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	The fact that this election has already gotten double the votes as the biggest election for is pretty cool


[24-Oct-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	when it’s ajar


[24-Oct-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Ayyyy


[24-Oct-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	When is a car not a car?


[24-Oct-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	When it turns into a driveway!


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	When it turns into a driveway


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	TOO SLOW


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Nice


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Dang, you googled it just a bit faster than me


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To be fair, I know a bunch of these from previous googles


[24-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Lets Be serious for one more second.


[24-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	LETTUCE indeed


[24-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	long lasting lettuce


[24-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	so how about them UK govs huh


[24-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	does prosperous universe need more Governors in general? I feel like it’s such a huge responsibility that generally people don’t want to or have the time to do it


[24-Oct-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Uh oh Philosophy! I’m out


[24-Oct-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	let me live in peace, stop trying to make me think about the universe damn you


[24-Oct-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	There are quite a few small planets lacking governors, A2b comes to mind


[24-Oct-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Why is there only 1 or 2 planets with extra scientists? This seems super odd


[24-Oct-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Have you seen how difficult it is to make most education upkeep items?


[24-Oct-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You also need Afabs to build or upgrade a UNI


[24-Oct-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I love that Swat wants to run the planet, but doesn't understand the basics of it.


[24-Oct-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	The lil guy can/should dream


[24-Oct-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Dude do you really just resort to attacks? This is a game after all.


[24-Oct-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	if you got a different more active member running, and won. I’d be cheering with the rest of nike


[24-Oct-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Don't mean we should live through the nightmare he creates .


[24-Oct-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StrykerSnow**:	doesn't mean you have to be a twat


[24-Oct-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Well, I could be sending everyone DMs, but I guess I'm not built that way?


[24-Oct-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Be a Swat, not a twat


[24-Oct-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	XD


[24-Oct-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Ok OOG, next question:


[24-Oct-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Zzzzz


[24-Oct-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Why are taxes set to the bare minimum and still complaints about the cost to build infrusture? Wouldn’t most people who make 2k per building per day gladly donate more than just 20 aic to support the high costs? What am I missing?


[24-Oct-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StrykerSnow**:	The kid is eager, active, and trying to improve things. Have a civilized conversation, and properly defend your position. Resorting to personal attacks is sad @dominicus..


[24-Oct-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	He's old enough to lie in DMs, he's big enough to take it on the chin. He's asking the most basic questions now, rather than before he started his campaign. And he's never contributed to the planet - just went for win sideways.


[24-Oct-22 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	When he's spent months figuring out the supplies to build up the planet and keep it going, he'll have my respect.


[24-Oct-22 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Otherwise, he's just playing for the crowd here...


[24-Oct-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	There’s a big difference between lying, and just being flat out wrong.


[24-Oct-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I guess you'd know.


[24-Oct-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	and I was mostly wrong. Still see a problem that isn’t getting solved more than the bare minimum


[24-Oct-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	and I’d like to try to solve the problem, even if I have a lot to learn


[24-Oct-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	matter of fact I’d like to ask oog for advice if they weren’t calling me a lier every chance they could


[24-Oct-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	You probably should have started there.


[24-Oct-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	You just want to win, and you think you know what to do. But you don't.


[24-Oct-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Hell, I've been playing this game a year and I couldn't run a planet.


[24-Oct-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Don't catch me shit-talking governors


[24-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	This is a bit much


[24-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Dude, OOG said itself that The previous gov was on vacation, there’s no shit-talking


[24-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	A lil heavy on the drama for PrUn


[24-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Doesnt matter. IM going to be gov


[24-Oct-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	(ME)


[24-Oct-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	my unawareness on taxes is simply my assumption from lack of activity, good to hear that OOG is trying to make up for where he was lacking


[24-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	He took those taxes and went on VACATION


[24-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Duhhh


[24-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Art gallery? Parks? He made this for his own enjoyment


[24-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	:D 2 and 0 for Rannepear


[24-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	so he could visit them on his vacation


[24-Oct-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	@Domicius, if YJ can be a gov...so can you, bud! Join the race


[24-Oct-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	To be gov, you need masses of cash, a deep industrial base and a Corp behind you.


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I'm a producer/shipper, I help the big guys get what they need to run the planet.


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Or you need a capitalist individual who’s willing to work really hard private message tons of people to get what is needed at the cheepest possible price


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	You dont need a corp but ok


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	The gov needs to put in the time to pull things together.


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Facts


[24-Oct-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Wherein lies the problem,


[24-Oct-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I mean yes, if you know people who'll make the things you can't buy, you can get by


[24-Oct-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	And there’s plenty of people making things, and contacting them is what I intend (and have been) doing.


[24-Oct-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I had 7 WOR lined up and would be asking Nike members to bid for the fabs


[24-Oct-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	besides, OOG still makes stuff, and I’m sure would like to get paid for it too.


[24-Oct-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YJ14**:	I get why you're upset with me and I don't blame you. I missed a couple days on programs and I am fully to blame for that so I apologize. I was away on vacation and then a work trip as well so its been a busy month. But I don't appreciate accusations that I'm taking tax money, pocketing it, and going on vacation. I have spent millions on this planet since setting up a base here, including paying way overvalue prices on the market for any missing upkeep items for months! Which apparently was necessary to Nike's success because I take one month off and suddenly the POPR is in a nose dive. Once I saw the problem (which happened pretty much overnight on a planet that is only 20% base capacity and was mostly PIO/SET buildings beforehand) I immediately invested in new infrastructure and brought the problem to OOG for us to start building a solution. But these things take time (sourcing rare materials and building the upkeep supply chains)


[24-Oct-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey YJ, could to see ya alive! HOWEVER. I DEMAND you explain how magnets work. And the moon landing, staged or real? Why did you kill JFK? I DEMAND ANSWERS!


[24-Oct-22 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The people want to know answers to these vital questions, as well as explanations to these nefarious accusations against you.


[24-Oct-22 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	“Good to see you alive.” Fuckin phone autocorrect


[24-Oct-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you win, more eng plz


[24-Oct-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The fact he has not answered these SCANDALOUS charges against him is proof he is once again trapped in Chruv’s sex dungeon. I call upon the good people of Nike to storm the battlements and free YJ from the OOG sex dungeon! Shield your eyes once you breach the walls, lest yee learn of their communist ways and stray from the glory that is capitalism! FORWARD, HEROES OF NIKE!


[24-Oct-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I wish I had a sex dungeon


[24-Oct-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You would have us believe, you somehow built an entire industrial empire to ensure the progress of planet infrastructure, and you DIDNT max out your sex dungeon infrastructure to 10?


[24-Oct-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	takes a lot of FUNs and BIDs to finish that project


[24-Oct-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YJ14**:	Magnets work because magic. There's a Stephen King novel on the JFK shooting called 11/22/63 that is very good - it will have your answers! I went willingly to the sex dungeon, what can I say time flies when you're having a good time


[24-Oct-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StrykerSnow**:	Finally, a man with all the answers


[24-Oct-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'll have enough to upgrade to a sex dungeon someday but for now I'll have to be content with just regular dungeons


[24-Oct-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I mean, uh, intensive retraining facilities


[24-Oct-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	taking a month off on a 1 month Governorship is kinda bad decisionmaking imo.


[24-Oct-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I am glad to hear tell of plans for the future, I honestly hope the better governor wins. and would be happy if it wasnt me, seeing all the amount of work it seems to take just to run I'm, sure it would be that much and more to source all of the materials needed without huge corp power behind it.


[24-Oct-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I think even if OOG wins, they should step up the taxes and build infustructure above 70%.. my plan has us getting 90 Eng's per week on the calculator by the term. but that means a massive boost to the infustructure.. THEN it might make sense to do education programs.


[24-Oct-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	well.. assuming you were just going for engis


[24-Oct-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	if you want techs and engies then yeah Education makes sense


[24-Oct-22 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	does OOG outsource any of the materials need for infrustructure?


[24-Oct-22 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	what happens if a planet's demands are more than the corp can provide?


[24-Oct-22 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I'm simply the pro tax capitalistic choice. I give OOG and other corps a fair shot at the need materials.


[24-Oct-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I sincerely think that the result of this election will be a good one regardless of who wins. now that its in OOG's sights and they realize they have to step it up a notch.


[24-Oct-22 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**valdin98**:	I just scrolled all the way up to see where this started today and got to a "load more messages" prompt before I found stuff I hadn't read and just gave up.lol


[24-Oct-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Yeah, chat has been fun today


[24-Oct-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	OOG is big enough that it doesn't really need to outsource upkeep. I myself have a entire FS dedicated to making just UTS for upkeep mostly. That's one of the ways we keep taxes down.


[24-Oct-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	well there are people of Nike who say we need more than what OOG is putting in.


[24-Oct-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**valdin98**:	My $0.02 would be the OOG brand is still solid but YJ14's is not. If OOG has literally anyone who can step up right now it seems like they would be a show in.


[24-Oct-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**valdin98**:	*shoe in


[24-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Churaviis, what happened in the last Phobos pop report? why is all the hapiness maxed out at 56% with no program run? is that just cause they don't "need" more?


[24-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I would have Dm'ed you but you wanted me to talk publicly. so w/e


[24-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We agree that Nike needs more and anyone that looks will see we've made a ton of upgrades recently and we have even more planned in the near future but it will take time for that to increase happiness as it's based on a rolling 4 week average of infrastructure upkeep


[24-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I literally am looking at the need fulfillment. of course happiness is a 4 week average


[24-Oct-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Phobos has an education program running for more ENG and SCI and I'm arranging for some infrastructure upgrades as well


[24-Oct-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Having OOG step up a bit is giving me alot of relief, I'm glad you guys are taking this seriously


[24-Oct-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	Still would say you should raise taxes to double and build SST up to 6 atleast.


[24-Oct-22 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YJ14**:	@valdin98 your point is valid. If my brand has soured with the people I promise I will step down in favour of another OOG corpmate but this election is too far along to do so this term. I can commit to focusing on Nike this term - I have no work trips and @Swatacular is correct that this election has acted as a wake-up call. Following this term OOG will make sure we have someone take over who can give more time to focus on Nike governance.


[24-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Sounds good. Im voting for myself of course but the humility and communivation is appreciated.  All Nikenese (?) deserve that going forward


[24-Oct-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YJ14**:	lol @ Nikenese... Nikians? Tough to make it work

[24-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Knarfaction**:	just putting it out there i am missing Engineers since last popr if OOG needs help with Infrstructure im willing to pay higher taxes, donate money or help with prefabs but i need the workers


[26-Feb-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Nike's unemployment rate has been maintained for a long time. Why do you lack engineers?


[26-Feb-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	If the next report continues to be short of ENG, I will switch to an education project and invest more materials.


[26-Feb-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	The tax rate for electronics engineers and scientists has been adjusted to the highest level, and besides, the rent for warehouses has been reduced.


[26-Feb-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	we lost over 10% of our Engineers last popr with an unemployment rate of 7.6% if you look at your construction menue it shows 0 availeble Engineers for new buildings and for some reason i only have 187 of 200 needed Engineers for my PP4s


[26-Feb-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	i just wanted to let you know :) after all its not a big problem and i notized it not by looking at the popr but by looking at my workforce numbers


[26-Feb-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	Other than pioneers, everyone is leaving the planet. How come their happiness is so low?


[26-Feb-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Unemployment is high, which lowers their happiness


[26-Feb-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. We aren’t using that population. And it’s futile to fight unemployment too much


[26-Feb-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	I can see that for settlers but engineers isn't high, is there a link between them?


[26-Feb-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, only link there is that the low fulfillment (safety health etc.)


[26-Feb-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but as stated, having em low has been a good thing due the low employment


[26-Feb-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	so can we get the higher tiers boosted in population without driving the unemployment of the lowe ones up as well?


[26-Feb-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	I'd rather not loose my higher class workers just because nobody is using settlers


[26-Feb-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well best course of action for that is to increase the higher tier fullfiments. Comfort being the main thing for engineers


[26-Feb-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	which ofc more expensive than other fulfillments, so no one increases it nilly willy, but after some degree of considiration :)


[26-Feb-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	is there a resource detailing the popi fulfillment and which class they affect?


[26-Feb-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yes ^_^: https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/#known-bugs

[26-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	can't find how population relates to fulfillment on that page


[26-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	can work out the need fulfillment number from popi, but how does that relate to poulation?


[26-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	it's a very convoluted system, this POPI.


[26-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yes, it involves lot of probing it with a long stick and seeing what happens afterwards ^_^'


[26-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	WTS HAB 😂


[27-Feb-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Lanshara a bit late, but using the % filled of a certain need you can take a weighted sum to find (most) of the true happiness of a workforce tier. Then average that over 5 weeks using a weighted average. Then education happens proportional to the happiness of the tier and migration may happen too

[10-Mar-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	ACA really isn't economical to my knowledge


[10-Mar-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	you're also best running the Engineer immigration next week I suspect. Engineer happiness will bounce right back with the sudden demand


[10-Mar-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	constantly spamming FES to generate a large surplus of unemployed pops isn't very efficient. I'd rather that money was targetted where needed. Aware OOG's coffers mean that the money tree can be near limitless but still best not to be wasteful imo.


[10-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'm quite certain that your definition of 'a large surplus of unemployed pops' is quite different from ours


[10-Mar-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The best infrastructure depends not just on cost but also on availability and scalability. Agriculture upkeep might be technically cheaper but more difficult to scale up due to the lack of fertile planets nearby as well as competing demand from consumables and carbon industries

[18-Aug-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You can now build puddlejumpers in the Nike system, making it much easier to colonize Antares III b if you need more space for construction buildings


[18-Aug-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but... wouldn't player just FTL onto Antares III b from the CX or Deimos?


[18-Aug-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Puddlejumpers don't have FTL, that's why they're so much cheaper


[18-Aug-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm just saying that... what comes off Nike that would need to many STL specific ships?


[18-Aug-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	LST for MCG maybe... but if it's AL... it's goign to be jumped in anyways


[18-Aug-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The idea is that you offload low tier construction buildings onto Antares III b so that you have more room on Nike prime for higher tier buildings while still being able to feed them from the low tiers on the other planet without having to use so many permits


[18-Aug-23 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Plus... Ant III has micro meteors of 2.5


[18-Aug-23 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for STL specific ships... you'd actually consider shields


[18-Aug-23 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(yes, I've done testing for this in this exact system)


[18-Aug-23 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	sure.. PP2s on Ant III b and transport them over to PP3/PP4 on Nike... but pre-fabs don't take that much room for multiple STL-ships

**Churaviis**:	That's what RDS are for


[18-Aug-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I don't know if it makes financial sense for a puddlejumper but it does save me from having to repair as often and I have more money than time

**RNGzero**:	well, I looked into it for you!


[18-Aug-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for a puddlejumper... adding a 300,000 part can defeat the purpose of tryign to make a cheap stl only ship


[18-Aug-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since the extra weight effects it's performance more than FTL trips


[18-Aug-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	each trip took ~25 minutes (orbits are close).. so to "payback" that 300,000 RDS... it'd take ~4 years of flight


[18-Aug-23 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	went all the way and did LHPs as well!

**RNGzero**:	basically... both shields and drones are useless for STL only ships around Antares III


[18-Aug-23 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	rounding caused the dmg numbers to 0 out... fixed here: https://i.imgur.com/2N7Xm2z.jpg

[18-Aug-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	300,000 is full price, if you include a pun in your contract I'll give you a discount on the RDS. More importantly, it still saves you from having to repair as often while not adding to the complexity of the repair. That convenience might be worth a lot depending on the person.


[18-Aug-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for FTL ships RDS could provide more benefits (as well as ROI) than for STL ships. I just wanted to show that in the tables presented


[18-Aug-23 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since weight matter more for STL trip than for FTL jumps

**jvaler**:	at least personally. don't think there's actual data on that


[26-Jan-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yes, I agree. That's part of whether it's going to get delivered in the timeframe I need


[26-Jan-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	ah i misunderstood


[29-Jan-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Prices + rating correlate with reliability. If you're keen on doing jobs, and have the rating to pick them up, then you should be able to do them. I myself offer like a 7-week staging on any public ads, so even if there's mistakes to be made, there's enough room for the counter-party to deliver, eventually.

**roganartu**:	@Hernanduer fyi we're looking for 72 more ENG, ideally at the next POPR if possible. Should've probably reached out before the last one dropped but cest la vie. If there's something we can do or contribute towards it lmk. Happy to pay for eng immigration program if it's what makes the most sense (I haven't checked)

[13-Feb-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I was also just letting the POPI run down a bit, I spun it up again last week so it'll naturally get back to a growing ENG anyways this coming POPR

**Komalarn**:	@GermanInc buying LST at 46CIS/u ... man, thats frickin bold


[22-Mar-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Anyone selling at that price will lose money, you understand that, right?


[22-Mar-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	@GermanHerman


[22-Mar-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That offer isn't a value equivalency, it's a time equivalency. Offering some liquidity, in exchange for commodities now, rather that at some random time in the future.l


[22-Mar-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yeah, I get that ... but you would have to be pretty desperate to accept that offer


[22-Mar-24 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You need not be desperate. Sometimes, your ships can't serive a base, and if you don't have plenty of STOs/Public Warehousing, you need to offload it somehow, or your production will get stunted.


[22-Mar-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I guess you could get into that position ... but not if you have 500 LST lying around


[22-Mar-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That person is just trying to take advantage of such situations.


[22-Mar-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I would understand selling 10-50 units at that price .. but 500? nope


[22-Mar-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	+ that F rating speaks for itself :D


[22-Mar-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	500 units is cheap..... even at 150 -> 200 AIC/u


[22-Mar-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	well, at 46CIS/u, its really cheap :D


[22-Mar-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	My point is, why bother?


[22-Mar-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Unless you're ready to execute on that offer, it doesnt apply to you, yes?


[22-Mar-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I just want to warn new players, do not accept this. Rather pay for shipping to CX and sell it there. Or wait, there are reasonable people posting BUY offers on LM


[22-Mar-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Or just post SELL offer on the LM, it will sell in no time for much better price


[22-Mar-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	CX bids are almost never reasonable, unless there is significant competition for a given commodity....


[22-Mar-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You will see unicorns, sometimes, in the LM ads, but those are rather rare, and they get taken fast if there's someone looking for them.


[22-Mar-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I just feel like these low-ball BUY offers are exploiting the BASIC users, because they cant post SELL offer, only accpet BUY offers


[22-Mar-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's selfish economic activity for you. Exploiting others, since they can't make what is being offered.


[22-Mar-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I am selling LST here on Nike very often, for very good price :) Those offers are not as rare


[22-Mar-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There is also another addendum to that.... Cheap offers on ASK @ CX, or the inverse, get cleared super fast, since others want to take advantage of their generosity, price-wise.


[22-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	CX bids are reasonable, the spread is due to the cost of leaving money in deposits on the buy side, and goods on the sell side.


[22-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	I usually sell LST here on LM for 120-150 AIC/u and its not like I am actively looking for them


[22-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	(for offers)


[22-Mar-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	+ if you get in touch with the specific people that buy LST here, they will send contracts directly to you. I had that deal like 6 months ago and it was very profitable for both sides


[22-Mar-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You're better off networking with people directly, than dealing with public ads that don't pertain to your situation.


[22-Mar-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yes, this is the way. LM is a great way to find these people


[22-Mar-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	well, ever since LEAD came out, you can do more market research :)


[22-Mar-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Literally everyone's super secret productions are exposed to anyone who's interested, if you know what to look for ^.^


[22-Mar-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Well, in a game, where the rules are set in stone, no production is a secret :D


[22-Mar-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Or I dont understand what do you mean :D


[22-Mar-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The rules are only generally set in stone. Some would say they are guidelines..... There's like 100 variations on how a base, on a given world can be made.


[22-Mar-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You won't know exactly, unless you ask.


[22-Mar-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	As an example. I did a catalogue of every base's general properties, on Avalon, some time ago. It's a FP COGC @ VH-331 (Hortus system). You'd think that everyone's running FP/FERs on there, but ~10->20 percent were running Manfacturing, Metallurgy, and Fuel Refining processes there, as majority base processes.


[22-Mar-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	How do i know? Just click a random filled plot on a planet's PLI interface --- you get alot of data. :P


[23-Mar-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Back to the  pricing comment, LST is a dump product for some of us. I make it for the Corp but I make so much sometimes I just need to dump it to clear inv


[23-Mar-24 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	So the "low ball" offers are actually a good way to do this.

[06-May-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Here we see an image of the strange magical powers of "several new pp4s" magically dropping the number of safety, health, comfort, culture, and education fulfillment, as well as the overall engineer population. Because when new buildings are added, somehow, that creates less jobs and reduces the governor's ability to put fulfillment in a planet's POPI.


[06-May-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Or the gov is making excuses for his failure to maintain the planet. You decide.


[06-May-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@hernanduer If you are looking to step back from the game, I'll happily bring someone to run for gov and add this planet to the dozen or so I already manage. You need not burden yourself, as well as those of us on this planet, for the sake of a misplaced obligation to deliver us unfulfilled jobs and factories short of workers.


[06-May-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I feel bad for whoever has scientists. Seems they have already lost their first worker on this POPR. More to be lost next week


[07-May-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-May-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Marismol ran Norwick for 5 months lol. You should see an optometrist asap, your eyes can go bad as you get old. Maybe that’s why fulfillment was not being provided, you kept clicking the wrong button whenever you went to add UTS to the art gallery. Mystery solved!


[07-May-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And if everything is running smoothly, why is it every one of your Corp mates I’m talking to agreeing that there is a problem? Why does a single oversight, that could have been addressed with a “oops, my bad, let me fix that”, but instead you seem upset? Take the criticism and do better. It’s not difficult to run a planet. I run 12. There have been dips in population and missed COGCs. Shit happens. But I own up to it and fix it. That’s all I’m askin for you to do. And memeing a bit along the way 😂

[07-May-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-May-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-May-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So run a program. I’m sure it will help for the week. But unless you address the actual problem, which is the lack of art gallery POPI upkeep, the problem will continue. Address that.

[15-Jun-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	The project I manage is the the DNPC concept. It aims to integrate multiple single-expert specialist bases across Deimos and Nike, focusing on BSE and BBH production. This approach ensures a consistent supply of BSE and BBH regardless of market fluctuations. It leverages the fifth expert to maximise profitability and efficiency by collaborative and efficient workflows.   We are looking for a person to run a PP2 base on Nike. This person will produce BBH or BSE. We loan out materials for building, and this person will request AL from the metallurgists in the project; who ship AL from Deimos. At the end of the week, all the producers of BBH and BSE will ship their Haul to ANT, where I take and distribute the materials as a share of the profit from the week's work.

[15-Jun-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Hello Fab makers of Nike! I'm Rise and I've governed on Hephaestus in Antares I for the past 20 terms and currently manage about 17 or so planets in Antares and its surrounding space via proxy governors. If you were unaware, a patch was deployed today that radically changes the way elections and governing operates in PrUn. What was once a benevolent dictatorship is now a power sharing among the highest voted members of an elected Parliament. I am unsure how the Devs heard players request "Let us gov multiple planets" and then decided that it was a good idea to impliment, "You need click 20 buttons and get to have 1-4 other people to click yes to pass a single change", but here we are.  Just looking to be an Parliamentarian, an observer, and to offer advice where I can. I appreciate any vote! To vote, simply go to "ADM ZV-194a" and choose a candidate!


[26-Jun-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(in 6.5 hours that is)


[26-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Hello all! I am running on a platform of supporting our longtime governor Hernanduer, and of course the promotion of our universally famous Nike LST (accept no substitutes).


[26-Jun-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I can vouch for Rise. I am on alot of planets, that his puppets have governed in the past and there have been no pop issues. A vote for Rise is a save bet.


[26-Jun-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	hey guys, politics is here at long last. We all want Nike to do well, and we're doing well now. First plan here will be to balance our books, so the plan is to not withdraw any funds this first session. After that, we'll establish a list of reimbursement values for each needed part


[26-Jun-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	we'll be able to use the internal chat for the government to track who supports what and ensure everyone gets adequate reimbursements. I'm hoping this plan will spread to farther planets if it works out well here.


[26-Jun-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	if we have a consistent positive or negative surplus, we will look at adjusting taxes to balance it out. That won't be until at least a couple of months from now


[26-Jun-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok, so the election started.  So I get 1 vote and there will be 3 members of parliament and the one with the most votes is governor.  Now what to do...  It's like everyone will vote for the incumbent but everyone else will vote for themselves.  You will have like the current gov with 30 votes and then 10 people with 1 vote.


[26-Jun-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I meant everyone else running other than the incumbent will vote for themselves - hence the 10 candidates with 1 vote each


[26-Jun-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Interesting, people are going to vote for which ever candidate is on the top of the list, which coincidentally is not the current gov, it is just whoever put their name in first to run


[26-Jun-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	This system seems to really favor corps because they can organize their votes to efficiently split them between the candidates that they want.


[26-Jun-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	especially in antares there are multiple groups of players thaht cooperate without having a corporation


[26-Jun-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I think you'll actually see roughly what is happening in Antares atm @Ravick, which is Rise taking control of more planets because he's a good governor and has support from a lot of people because of that


[26-Jun-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I think the open question atm for a lot of these planets is whether the incumbent will manage to get a seat at all, let alone whether they'll be able to get friendly members elected alongside them


[26-Jun-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	believe it or not, Rise doesn't want the headache of running every planet in Ant


[26-Jun-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I welcome him on any planet as an MP, he basically already was on most of them


[26-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	ADM <any Antares planet> since the update might beg to differ


[26-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hernanduer**:	which I am all for


[26-Jun-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and is why you'll see OOG members running on Heph and all other planets he generally ran as well


[26-Jun-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	everyone just wants the best Antares


[26-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I don't think who is and isn't running atm is really indicative of anything except "ooh shiny and new" right now. ADM on every planet in the universe is full of people clicking run now that there's just more seats. I think what's most interesting is who is getting votes


[26-Jun-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you can actually do "POL RiseofFilth" to see just how many planets they're running on.

[26-Jun-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	See this entire game come to a crumbling halt in 2 weeks


[26-Jun-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it'd take a lot of people, but yeah it's not impossible


[26-Jun-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	a more immediate threat though is the gatekeeping of all non-faction planets


[26-Jun-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	10mil establish tax on all of them can be very interesting and drive a good reason to expand to slightly less optimal planets


[26-Jun-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	A lot less than you think. We can only vote one person. Most noncommittal players vote one and move on. The teamsters all vote each other than balance their votes to secure the majority.


[26-Jun-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	At the very least they should've limited people who run and vote to planet bases only. This free for all is dumb.


[26-Jun-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	bases only, yes


[26-Jun-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Nowhere else on the planet (IRL) can random people start running for office and casting votes for other countries, cities, states.


[26-Jun-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That they don't have some sort of legal Nexus*


[26-Jun-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	there was a very tumultuous bout of voting on Norwick late last year


[26-Jun-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so I wouldn't put it past everyone to be so oblivious about it


[26-Jun-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	In the beginning, but just like how RoF is running on 30+ planets, once a coordinated group of people (OOG??)) figure out how to coordinate well, this entire game can fall.


[26-Jun-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Personally there's a small part of me that does see the entire game screech to a halt.


[26-Jun-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	When you run for office which you can do on any planet now, then you do you also get a vote?  If so, then you don't have to vote for yourself so you could in theory vote in every election.  Is this right?


[26-Jun-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You can run on a planet without a base there but you can't vote without a base there


[26-Jun-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ah, that makes sense


[26-Jun-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I think the thought that the whole game is gonna fall apart is pretty alarmist. That was largely possible before too. A big group of coordinated people can put one person as the governor of each planet, and that didn't happen.


[26-Jun-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	It's the same idea that piracy could destroy the entire game, yet here we are with something like <$100k a year in piracy losses per year, universe-wide


[26-Jun-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	as to why Rise is running for so many planets, I can’t speak for him but I can tell you why I vote for him and perhaps the resonates with others who do: he is good at governing and cares deeply about doing it well and efficiently. He has been doing this for most of Antares for a long time to much success, and the new system allows him to do that more easily so why wouldn’t he?


[26-Jun-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	if you support what he’s done on the 17 planets he’s been looking after around here for a long time, it makes sense to support the expansion of that (assuming one believes he can sustain it)


[26-Jun-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	but it’s a democracy after all. I think you grossly overestimate the ability of a small group of people to ruin the whole game easily. There’s hundreds of bases on planets like Nike and Deimos. Many people don’t vote, historically, but a sure fire way to improve voter turnout is to fuck things up (especially maliciously)


[26-Jun-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Rwinner16 I think we will see that those who intend to abuse the system, whether it be to extract money via high taxes and fees, or more as a perspective of prestige and ego, who will look to recruit and organize their membership to control multiple seats, and therefore the majority in Parliament votes. But this isnt new, and the concept of voting blocs/corps voting to maintain a governor who is AFK, pushing bad policy, or not maintaining the planet is more common than I'd like.


[26-Jun-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Thankfully, I've seen it more in the past. In today and yesterday's governors, much less so, which makes me very happy.

[26-Jun-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Honestly, what I'd like to see happen is for more Antares folks to join the UFO Antares Governing channel, and for it to be more active and used. Many people that have bases here have bases across all of Antares. Such a forum would be an ideal place to centralize organization, supporting industries, requests for POPI materials, etc. What I do not want to happen again, is what happened with a random person got control of Elon and raised the taxes through the roof claiming he was paying 3x as much as he was taking in, while ignoring any and all advice being given. It only ended when I was able to run a proxy gov the next cycle and replace him. My greatest concern is a similar thing will happen, but that person will have the backing of a large corporation because of image and ego. Hopefully all players can see beyond names and corp tickers when it comes to effective and honest governance.


[26-Jun-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	https://discord.gg/wHKsgmEj (maybe this will work?)


[26-Jun-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But otherwise to address comments made by multiple people... I run 17+ planets. I might end up being top slot on a few more or less. Who knows. My greatest concern is effective, efficient, and honest governance. The fact that I run so many is borne from a lack of people willing to step up. I am curious how this update will change that, but I'm hestitant to just completely step aside and hope a dozen+ planets figure it out in their first month.


[26-Jun-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	On Nike, as well as other planets that I've not historically managed via proxies, my goal is to have a seat at the table, see how things are run, and to offer advice and constructive criticism where I can. I feel as if my experience running Hephaestus personally for 20 months, and 16+ other planets for various periods from months to years makes me qualified. In coming months, if all is well, I will happily cede my seat to younger players eager to engage in the mechanics.


[26-Jun-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That being said, I'll happily take any and all votes, and whether I get the top seat, or the bottom, my deferral and desire to work with the other elected Parliamentarians stays the same.


[27-Jun-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Hey guys, just a reminder that the plan I'm bringing is to keep our coffers locked for this first month. After that, we'll start balancing payouts based on a distributed sheet of fair value for POPI and COGC items. My plan is to make all of this transparent so that we can see Nike be the leader in Antares space. If this sounds good to you, please make sure to give me a vote. Thanks


[27-Jun-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	The plan is to allow anyone to get proper recompense for any COGC contributions, including new players. POPI will be possible as well with some coordination

**Hernanduer**:	It seems after the last tax bill, we've increased our production fee revenue by about 25%. That should allow us to continue running for a few months without further increases. In the mean time, I've adjusted my production chains to provide slightly cheaper materials for the higher end POPI, and will be using those materials once I begin passing motions to pay myself


[14-Jul-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	We're currently looking at about 500k/week in revenue for the planet


[14-Jul-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	So in total, this is my expectation


[14-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Revenue: 70k/d


[14-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	POPI expenses: 75k/d


[14-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	COGC expenses:9k/d


[14-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so there's about a 14k/d gap to be covered still


[14-Jul-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Given I won't start withdrawing any monies until August, we will have about 2mil in the bank. That gives us a burn down of about 4 months before we have to adjust the tax rate (preferably earlier than that)

**Hernanduer**:	Quick financials update: We currently have 1.6m in the treasury. We're currently averaging 75k/d on income, however we're looking at about 85k/d on expenses including POPI and COGC.

**Tanda**:	do it, we ain't skeered


[23-Jul-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Yeah, we'll do some adjustment after the first month or two of taking payouts. I think some jobs have a super long lead time, so the tax revenue is taking a while to roll in


[23-Jul-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Surprisingly, even since the adjustment taxes have still been going up about 1k/d/d

**Katinga**:	What secret?  There's no secret that Rise has minions.  lol


[01-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I've never gone to anyone and said "Join my corp, or we will run a candidate and vote you out." OOG has done this for years. Pre-Politics change, how many time ever, has OOG said "Hey, this person unaffliated with us is going a good job. We should support them and help them get elected."


[01-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Just about never I'd wager.


[01-Aug-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	My "minions" are the community that I work and trade with, who have seem my governance in action, seen my promises fulfilled, and having been asked to, or on their own, voted for me. That is democracy in action, not a hostile take over or whatever nonsense is being pettled.


[01-Aug-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Katinga and you are welcome to use the same slur that Hern uses in your discord when talking about people who vote for me. It just shows the hostility OOG truly feels for anyone outside their group having a voice in government, which OOG has long considered its personal playground.

**Roh**:	Just so that you guys know this..... I'd pay premium money to attend a voice-chat lobby, where you guys go at each other like this -- #wholesome-content. Putting that aside, I'm pretty sure that there is a data-persistency issue, especially on UFO -- (There's no planetary chats for ZV-194a) -- it's hard for people to navigate on any ongoing issues/concerns with a planet, when there's only a COMG that just gets rolled over, every now and then, to which it only affords invested input. Your arguments, politics, intentions, and whatever, can easily be "aired-over" and parsed, should enough attention be available to it.


[01-Aug-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	There is a Nike channel on UFO. You need to go to bot-spam and put in !join nike


[01-Aug-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah I poured over that like x3 over. I must be dyslexic or something, since I dropped !join-all on the bot spam, over the past 1-2 months.


[01-Aug-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Like, now I see it clearly.


[01-Aug-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	*!joinallplanets -- yes, I did that.


[01-Aug-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Mm.... Last post on there.... 28th of October '22... Something's not adding up.


[01-Aug-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Bot issues? Idk.


[01-Aug-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Or maybe I am dyslexic! Geez I was on there late last year. OOF.


[02-Aug-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Nah, it is just quiet on UFO. Things do feel a little stale in general at the moment unless you are working towards a solo or collective goal


[02-Aug-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Aug-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For TECs? They really like the basic Safety + Health stuff. Those that you said, are for higher tiers.


[06-Aug-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I may be reading it wrong, but as of 2 days ago there were more than 2500 unemployed techs.


[06-Aug-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	If you've only built your base in hte last 2 days you'd likely not see the full population allocated until the next pop cycle in 5 days time. If you're currently short.


[06-Aug-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RatgorWesbar**:	ok, then i should be fine then. ahh i jusst read they were low on the planet and thought it was what they nedded


[06-Aug-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Higher taxes :D


[06-Aug-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Razenpok**:	Taxes go brrrrrr


[06-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yep. In line with what I've stated during the election cycle, bringing taxes up a hair to be in line with other planets and ensure that the planet's income has a marginal surplus that will allow for further ugprades as required to maintain an efficient and reasonable monthly upkeep. I am hoping we land around 150k surplus a week. Those ART upgrades aint cheap, boys and girls. Fun fact. ABH are going for between 55k and 46k on market right now. The post-change tax is 212 AIC per 2 ABH built. If we assume you get 50k per, that means per cycle, producing 100k in value, you are taxed 212 AIC. That is .212% tax rate. I think we all with PP3s and PP4s can afford such a rate to ensure healthy planetary wallet and infrastructure, dont you?


[06-Aug-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	I paid 80k in taxes last cycle. Of 2M in total expenses, on 5M profit. Taxes are generally negligible imo


[06-Aug-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Aug-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And you want to talk about hard earned cash going into pockets, I'll remind you that it is your corporation that controlled a number of planets and organized it so that the money went into 30~ or so of its member's pockets. Phobos alone, pulls 12 million in taxes a month. The upkeep, even when run poorly by Churv, cost no more than 3mil a month. That other 9mil a month? You want to talk about cash going to pockets, talk about where that 9mil went every month.

**RiseofFilth**:	That is the revenue of Phobos. Over 3 million AIC every week


[07-Aug-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	12mil a month.


[07-Aug-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And until I became governor, for 2 years OOG's members collected all that money, and never paid back more than 3mil/month, even when the ex-gov ran it poorly. I now maintain it for under 2mil a month


[07-Aug-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	so You want to talk about money going in wallets, please pay back to the wallet of phobos 9mil per month for the 2 years he was in charge. Please and thank you.


[07-Aug-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	For those keeping count, that is 216 million AIC.


[07-Aug-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That is just one planet that they, as an organization, grifted and stole from.


[07-Aug-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Though I will say, in fairness, such an exptrapolation isnt really accurate, given the fact the population has grown significantly over the past 2 years, so the numbers wouldnt be that large :), but the principe stands and the method OOG used to collect and embezzle funds from the planets they oversaw is undeniable.


[07-Aug-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But do go on and continue to have this selective amnesia over the sins of your corp, but then hem and haw over any penny someone else spends to upgrade a planet with complete transparency.

**Hernanduer**:	where are the ENG


[28-Sep-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	?


[28-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	gone down pretty hard the last two POPR


[28-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and now negative


[28-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	(also because I just built some PP4s)


[28-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	like just now, not this last POPR


[28-Sep-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	hmmm lets see


[28-Sep-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The cycles are "fine". 59k AIC daily expense via POPI. 411k AIC weekly expense via same. Some of the POPI inventories are running low-ish, but it's not my concern.


[28-Sep-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The overall distribution of costs, for this POPR density, is fairly cheap, so it's another non-issue. I've mentioned on like Phobos or Heph COMGs as to how the POPR cycles, per tier, tend to look in the long term. Based on what is currently in-supply in the POPIs, you'll have that continue, provided they are contributed to.


[28-Sep-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The heavy unemployment, due to the education churn last month, contributed to lower happiness rates, which contributed to the outward migration this month. This situation will reverse in the upcoming POPRs.


[29-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	okay but I'm still missing ENG


[29-Sep-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	if the ENG pop hadn't collapsed the last 3 POPRs that wouldn't be the case


[29-Sep-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and yes, 5% outflow per POPR is collapsing


[29-Sep-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	just fix it


[29-Sep-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	hasnt the number gone up the last 2 weeks? increased by 44 then 130 this week, so ...it is being fixed?


[30-Sep-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	no, you have to keep in mind it's a momentum sort of thing, but also as it goes down the happiness is easier to fulfill


[30-Sep-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	because unemployment removes happiness, so losing 5% ENG one month will make the next month easier to fulfill


[30-Sep-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	also there was a near uprising when ENG went down to -1% about 5 months ago


[30-Sep-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	I mean you said you put down PP4, that ate what was available…it’s being fixed and it’s gone up the last 2 weeks…seems pretty normal lol


[30-Sep-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	Point is, it *is* being fixed so let’s chill yeh?


[30-Sep-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	fix it faster, yeh?


[01-Oct-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	shouldn't be problem if ENG pop hadn't collapsed before


[01-Oct-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but it did :^)


[01-Oct-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and btw we were 74 ENG short last POPR just by decay, no one put any new buildings


[01-Oct-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	maybe if we had a governor who wasn't busying running 25 other planets this would be noticed :^)


[01-Oct-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceMartin**:	pew pew pew shots fired


[01-Oct-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Will you run again @Hernanduer ?


[02-Oct-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The @Antarean_Emperor does have at least that many governorships....


[02-Oct-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But... there's also so many more elected members of Parliament, who can sketch up quick motions, and plug them into a vote.


[02-Oct-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But that's if anyone is paying attention to the POPRs, and if said persons have their budget allocations counted. It's beside the point. I've waited 3 weeks for my workforce allocations on SE-110a... They eventually came, it was a little bit annoying, but this is a very slow game.


[02-Oct-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I'm good with one crushing defeat, thanks


[02-Oct-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The crushing defeat happens to all, when they quit the game.


[02-Oct-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	Nah. There's 2k in the unemployment pool, and you only got so many so far, cuz you get 10% of those when you build, and have to wait until the next POPR report for worker redistributions.


[02-Dec-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Okawari**:	Ah.


[02-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Okawari**:	I got about 50% of the workers I needed. I assumed you would get all the workers you needed if there was enough unemployed.


[02-Dec-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	nah only 10% --- when you construct a building, on the lower section it lists what pops you need (and in the parenthesis it tells you how many are available rn)

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Nike! FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs. If you're interested in how we do things, come check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

**martinc1194**:	Sorry for the wrong calculation, I am using PRUNNER for the calculation. But didn't realise the report in PRUNNER isn't match to the game.  Please contact me if anyone loses ENG in the base.
