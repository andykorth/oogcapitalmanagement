**Ryst**:	Ah, all my lonely planets aren't quite as lonely anymore!


[20-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Just try to protect you from becoming a hermit ;) Just tell me if I can contribute something here aswell.


[24-Jul-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@xensored, you can just leave POPI alone here for awhile as well. Happiness only affects population growth. And it only shrinks if happiness is less than 50% (I think that's the number). Since we have plenty of unemployed population available, I wouldn't add anything to POPI unless you plan to add a bunch of buildings. We could even let happiness and population decrease here for awhile and still be just fine.


[25-Jul-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	ok understand. I don't plan to add more buildings. Will not fill the upkeep next time then. thank you for the advise!

**Ryst**:	What's your plan on our little, out-of-the-way planet?


[21-Aug-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	I l plan a chemical base, for EPO, DDT and THF Production. Next up is my chemical base and in the next month I hope to migrate my POL from Gibson..

**Ryst**:	Looks like we have some POPI growth needs for SETs. I have some OFF coming to help with that. If anyone plans to add more production buildings, LMK, and I'll make sure to stay more on top of it. Definitely wasn't a big deal when I was the only one here. 🙂🤷‍♂️


[07-Sep-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	I plan to build up to 3 POL this month and a LAB in the end of the month, but need only SET for the LAB. I'm willing to help where I can with supplies.


[07-Sep-22 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	I'm planning to build some CHP POL and a LAB this month as well


[07-Sep-22 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	I'm also happy to help with supplies


[07-Sep-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	I'll send in a shipment this week to run the safety station if no one objects


[08-Sep-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll have some OFF here in a day-ish for the INF. That's the more important one since the PIO need shouldn't be too big of an issue.


[08-Sep-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	And thanks for all the offers to help. Anyone is more than welcome this time, but no need for the future. That's what taxes are for. This time just kind of caught me off guard. (I've been here for quite some time and basically just ignored POPI after it landed where I needed it to be.)


[15-Sep-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	TUB and fabs are on their way to bump the INF up to level 2. I think that's needed since we're at 100% on life support, safety, and health... and the setter pop only increased by 70 last POPR.


[19-Sep-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Placidus**:	hi, i've built 391/500 area here - EXT/SME/POL/CHP. i don't have plans to go above SET or above 500 area level currently. i haven't learn much about how planet maintenance works, but let me know if assistance needed anytime. I send a ship to and from here every few days. A bit unreliable at keeping an eye on chat boxes though!


[21-Sep-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Thanks, @Placidus. Will keep you in the loop.


[21-Sep-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Looks like we had better settler growth this time, but we're still lacking. I've set up the settler immigration program to run with the next POPR, so we'll get an extra 200 besides regular growth. That should get us back to some type of unemployment number...


[29-Sep-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Running another settler immigration program next POPR. We had a lot more growth this period, but it also looks like some folks added to their workforce...

**pounder**:	Hi, I'm thinking of building a LAB at some point. When would be a convenient time for that?


[09-Oct-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	We have some TEC unemployment,you would get some TEC immediately. I assume you'll get around 30 after the POPR. To support some TEC, we could fill the PAR again. @Ryst I can make some PFE here onsite just fyi if needed


[09-Oct-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	speaking of the people talking about unemployment a few weeks ago


[09-Oct-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	woof


[09-Oct-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm not helping when I put down a full base :D


[09-Oct-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cause it seems like I wasn't the only one to do it


[09-Oct-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lot of people are piling into chem atm


[09-Oct-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	EPO is hot


[09-Oct-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Is anyone not close to having a full workforce? POPR is always a bit confusing... I *think* the open jobs on this report are calculated based on what was open *before* the report ran and population increased. So, I think we're fairly close...


[09-Oct-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Anyway, please let me know if you are severely understaffed. Otherwise, I probably will just let normal immigration take over this time instead of running another program.


[09-Oct-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@xensored, I'll get back to you in a day or two after I hopefully hear back that everyone's workforce is close to filled.


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes you're right


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so there are no unemployed settlers


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because change > open jobs


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but there is a shortage of like 50 pioneers


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's fine


[09-Oct-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it'll be fixed next week


[10-Oct-22 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Yeah it should be fine for PIO/SET. My comment was only regarding TEC.


[10-Oct-22 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If he needs 70 TEC and may be others would like some TEC aswell, we should fill the existing PAR again. Or we just run a TEC program and let the PAR empty like it is. Depends on the need if it will be only 70 one time or more?


[10-Oct-22 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	I will need 150 TEC at the end of the month for LAB and TNP but not this week. I have to build the necessary prefabs first.


[10-Oct-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Placidus**:	I'm running PIO 440/460/475 (so 20 PIO short, hopefully filled next time, but not vital) and SET 575/575/620  (I've not built enough HB2, but run out of area and no plans to use a second permit here). I have no TEC requirement. Cheers.


[10-Oct-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Placidus**:	*575 (workforce) / 620(required) / 575 (capacity) for SET


[11-Oct-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	Just to be clear I should not build a LAB this report?


[11-Oct-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Incorrect. Build it right before POPR runs. So, soon, I guess. Within the next 10 hours.


[11-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	You'll be a little light initially, but building it before POPR runs should "entice" a few more TECs to show up.

[20-Oct-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Anyone willing and able to produce and sell CL here? I still need it but am going to stop producing it. And I'd rather buy it here than ship it from the CX. Won't really need it for a month or so, but wanted to give the heads-up if someone was willing.


[20-Oct-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	How much CL do you need?


[21-Oct-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	15-16 per week


[24-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	Anyone here who runs a CLF?  I need HMS produced and can supply input materials .


[24-Oct-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If no one does, I have a corp mate who was considering it. How much will you need?


[25-Oct-22 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	20 for the next month.


[05-Mar-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	How's everyone doing here for workforce? Anyone planning to add any settlers any time soon? Ping me, if so. Might need to update the INF at some point.


[12-Mar-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Or just contribute more to it...


[12-Mar-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I‘m fine. Everything will stay like it is


[13-Mar-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	I had a few changes last week. I will need 30 more settlers and 100 more technicians. After that the base is complete, no further changes planned.

[07-Jun-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	FYI, I haven't been slacking with POPI upkeep. It's just looked like we've had plenty of unemployment for awhile (and still do). I'll probably add a little to the SST and INF later in the week to see what happens with the report next week.


[07-Jun-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Everyone should still have a full workforce. But if you're planning to add a bunch of buildings or have any concerns, certainly let me know!

**KaiserZero**:	@Ryst when will be the next pop report comes out?


[05-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	~19 hours


[05-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KaiserZero**:	Nice. It will fill my current workforce after that time right?


[05-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	if there are enough workers, sure


[05-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KaiserZero**:	Good to hear. The timing I settled here I hope it fulfills the current workforce


[05-Sep-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	What did you build? CHPs? LABs? POLs?


[05-Sep-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	LMK tomorrow how your workforce looks. I can always run a program to pull in a bunch of one type of worker in a pinch.


[05-Sep-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KaiserZero**:	@Ryst CHP :) So need around 60% setts and 40% pioneers


[06-Sep-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@KaiserZero, how's your pop looking now? I assume you're more short on SET than anything else...


[06-Sep-23 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KaiserZero**:	@Ryst I am short about 200 pioneers and 250 settlers


[07-Sep-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	OK, just kicked off a SET immigration program. Hopefully that helps a bit for now. We'll see what POPR does next week. I'll run a PIO immigration program then, as needed.


[07-Sep-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Good to know! I just ran a SET Immigration program (ends in a couple days). Will take a look at POPI tomorrow and plan to run another program when this one expires, either SET or PIO.


[12-Sep-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll also start adding more to the upkeep of the SST and INF. There hasn't really been an issue with having enough workers until recently, so I've kept everything minimally stocked, which had been enough.


[12-Sep-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Depending on how many new companies settle here and the size of the workforce needs, we may need to bump up the SST to L2. But we'll see as things progress.


[12-Sep-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	In any case, I may bump up SET and TEC taxes a little. Again, we'll see as things progress.


[12-Sep-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Anyway, I'll keep watching chat to see when people settle here. But keep me in the loop if you have some timeframes and how quickly you want to build out your workforces.


[12-Sep-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	Will do, thank you! I just put down an HQ, probably won't actually build for another week though. iHelp and Knarfaction will be joining too. We can bring some extra DW and OFF, we've also got mats incoming already for a WH.


[12-Sep-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	as far as workforce I'll have 510 PIO and 1525 SET, iHelp will have 840 PIO, and I'm not sure about Knarf


[12-Sep-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I'm fine waiting a little for those SET to be filled, and also happy to contribute to any festivals or upgraded if you think that's needed


[12-Sep-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	OK, sounds good. I'll probably run another SET immigration program then since that's where we're likely to have the greatest deficit initially.


[13-Sep-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KaiserZero**:	Alright report comes out im just short with around 42 PIO which is not bad afterall

[20-Sep-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Also, thanks @Knarfaction for upgrading the SST & INF. They're both set to max level usage, and I've added a few more upkeep materials. So we should be mostly good in another week or so (unless you all have another friend who's planning to drop a full base yet). 🙂


[20-Sep-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	Sorry I missed this yesterday, I'm short 1136 SET and 210 PIO. I know mine was the biggest demand, didn't expect it to be filled super quick. I've got some OFF and DW I can donate later to help offset the cost of these programs. Thank you


[21-Sep-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	yeh missed it as well i´m missing 540 PIOs


[21-Sep-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	OK, well, there should be 200 more SET now that would've been divided among everyone who employs SETs. We were at 100% for life support, safety, and happiness last report. Plus the SST and INF are running on level 3 and have a bunch of upkeep mats stocked. So we should get a fairly large increase of both PIO and SET next week.


[27-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	It looks like we have plenty of employment (or rather, unemployment) here. So I set the SST & INF to level 2. Going to let the POPI decline slightly more this report, will top off the infrastructure with upkeep materials, and then see what happens on the following report.


[06-Nov-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xensored**:	@Ryst I changed my base layout and moved my 6 LABs from Griff here to produce my DDT on this base. So there will be a TEC demand of 420. I filled DW for the park, that should be sufficient. Let's see how it goes, no stress for the TEC, I can wait also some weeks


[01-Feb-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Sounds good. I started an education program since we have plenty of PIOs & SETs. Between that and the DW in the PAR, we should get a decent bump next week.


[07-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	got all TEC filled, thanks!


[07-Feb-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	thanks Aahz (even though you're not here yet xD)


[27-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Exobros**:	Always Happy when Planets I have a base on get named. :D


[30-Jun-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	CoGC stuff here in 12h unless someone gets to it sooner ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[03-Jul-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Thanks @CptColeslaw. Sorry for missing that... I've been on a mountain for the past week and a half. Thought I had everything covered before I left, but I guess not. I'll be back home and on a larger monitor later today and will be catching up over the next couple days...


[03-Jul-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	no worries! been there. mountains are the best, have fun :)

**CheeryMan**:	Hello everyone. I ahve finally arrived :D


[07-Jul-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	And a little disappointment, I have lack of pioners and huge lack of settlers :(


[07-Jul-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	pioneers are a little tight but Ryst running that program should fix it, and looks like there's plenty of settlers you'll just have to wait until the next POPR to get them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09-Jul-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	Should I bring in some SUN and OFF to help with Safety Station upkeep, or is someone else planning to cover?


[09-Jul-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**molp**:	I am bringing 150 OFF


[09-Jul-24 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**molp**:	in ~3h


[09-Jul-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I just arrived with 1800


[16-Jul-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Hey there, @Gravy


[16-Jul-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	welcome!


[16-Jul-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Hi guys!


[17-Jul-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Looks like we might be ever-so-slightly short on SETs but good on PIOs/TECs. Specifically @Gravy and @CheeryMan, can you confirm based on your workforces?


[17-Jul-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I'm short pioneers, but got all my settlers


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I only need 500 settlers so the round robin filled me and stole from someone with more


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I've got all my pio's. That's weird lol


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Crap, I realize now I don't have OVE


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	obviously my first base....


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I'm full up on both


[17-Jul-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	for numbers


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	Sorry, I rarely read COM chats


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	All's ok with PIO and SETs for me :)


[04-Aug-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Does anyone here make OFF that you'd be willing to sell to the ol' gov't for POPI?


[04-Aug-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I can certainly buy it from the CX, but figured I'd ask here first...


[04-Aug-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	absolutely. how much do you need?


[04-Aug-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I make CL/EPO here for turning into OFF, so only seems fair to help here, lol


[04-Aug-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Cool. Looks like 1500/month will keep both the SST and INF filled...


[04-Aug-24 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I can definitely do that. I'll send 2000 over now on my way to Tacotopia ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[17-Aug-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dlrow**:	50% off on on some HAL to free up inventory, posted on LM
