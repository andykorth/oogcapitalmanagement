@cdgwaddell What did you have in mind for a base?


[10-Dec-23 06:23 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Still figuring that out, I'm not sure if the 250k grant would cover establishing a 2nd base (I haven't sat down on prunplanner and the game to calculate that out), but my current base in promitor has moved towards Prefabs. I'm contemplating if we'd like to have fuel in Antares / looking at what seems to be lacking in the consumables... (I additionally make EXO / SUN / PE on promitor. I could go full PE but im not very trusting of prunplanners pricing / the economy doesn't move fast enough for that?)


[10-Dec-23 06:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Prunplanner's profit calculator is pretty consistent and accurate for the most part unless something drastic happens.


[10-Dec-23 06:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
250k isn't an amount for a full base but it is definitely a start, depending on choice.


[10-Dec-23 06:24 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I've noticed a few irregularities on some items, but mostly cause it's lacking data...


[10-Dec-23 06:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Have you set the pricing for the things you are looking at for the ANT cx buy/sell price?


[10-Dec-23 06:25 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I could probably establish a very basic Fuel Depot, but I'm still contemplating. (I haven't gotten to prunplanner, I'm trying to identify the best planets / figure out where I want to go)


[10-Dec-23 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Prunplanner would definitely the best way to go about doing that in my opinion.


[10-Dec-23 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
One option could be resource extraction, there's a consistent market for ores at the CX that pay a decent price.


[10-Dec-23 06:27 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I was looking at that, my current base (https://prunplanner.org/plan/VH-331a/cc647329-bec1-4fb7-a070-3f8aac68ea5e) needs basic resources and a lot of people need them...


[10-Dec-23 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
LST on Nike could be a good option as well.


[10-Dec-23 06:29 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
It could be and I could establish a construction company over in Antares


[10-Dec-23 06:29 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Meaning I could help us with future building supplies


[10-Dec-23 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you could get a supply of AL to Nike you could setup PP2s into Bfabs.


[10-Dec-23 06:30 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I was toying with my main plan to build in pp2s


[10-Dec-23 06:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know Afka and sidepipe are working on Harmonia at the minute, they could work on C production to offset the cost and you could have a little vertical plan going on.


[10-Dec-23 06:30 PM] cdgwaddell#0000

[10-Dec-23 06:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Essentially, there's plenty of options available.


[10-Dec-23 06:31 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I was gonna burn him in the incinerator a few days ago


[10-Dec-23 06:32 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Possibly, I was contemplating at some point dropping my farms and buying the agriculture so that I could expand the hub into more carbon production


[10-Dec-23 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
C is probably the biggest expenditure next to AL.


[10-Dec-23 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I produce close to 200AL a day on Deimos but that's all tied up in a project unfortunately.


[10-Dec-23 06:33 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Yes carbon is costly


[10-Dec-23 06:33 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Right now my production is efficient enough that prunplanner says I make it for about 127ish in my currency


[10-Dec-23 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's pretty good.


[10-Dec-23 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
C sells for what, 600 on ANT at the minute?


[10-Dec-23 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
620, with sell orders at 645.


[10-Dec-23 06:34 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Yeah, if I had any carbon on me/my base at the time I would have sent it all over and put out an ask for it


[10-Dec-23 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Carbon production within ANT could be a very useful endeavour in that case.


[10-Dec-23 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
We could potentially do something with Carbon.


[10-Dec-23 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'd need to make a spreadsheet for it though to see for 100%.


[10-Dec-23 06:36 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Let me look at a few things, check some costs I think I could rebuild my same base over on Antares if I find a decent enough base... But I'm not sure what the Antares bonus is


[10-Dec-23 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Antares bonus is electronics if I recall correctly.


[10-Dec-23 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which isn't all that useful, to be honest.


[10-Dec-23 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
You'd be better of looking for your COGC bonuses.


[10-Dec-23 06:37 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I think Insitor is agriculture bonuses?

I'll probably create up a plan draft tomorrow and we'll go from there.


[10-Dec-23 06:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
It isn't like we are in a rush with your flight time anyway.


[10-Dec-23 06:40 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Have a good one, I'm contemplating which planet to establish the next base on. Harmonia could allow decent carbon and jump me into Prefabs


[10-Dec-23 06:41 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
But Nike has the LST which I believe is a major component of my Prefabs so I might be able to do something with that


[10-Dec-23 06:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
LST is needed for Bfabs yes.


[10-Dec-23 06:42 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I'll setup a plan for Nike, we can always import my carbon from the HUB and have Antares be the construction base.


[10-Dec-23 06:56 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
https://prunplanner.org/shared/9e17f0a1-6bd1-4d67-921b-433802a70743 with this, I'd slowly plan to move the production at my first base to have more carbon or increase prefab production by bring some lst back, and then focus on making prefabs here Edit: we'd prob wanna do  the EXT and BMP first so it starts profitable and I move into PP1 on the 2nd base, not sure yet.


[12-Dec-23 04:27 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Oh yeah, forgot to mention Antra X landed at Antares station this morning.


[12-Dec-23 10:27 PM] cdgwaddell#0000

as of right now, I'd need max 7-8 a day

90k a day for the CL consumption alone.

hence HAL to CL üòÑ


[19-Dec-23 07:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
i know a guy for HAL. just need to figure out if it makes more sense to start with just chem plants, or to do very small scale DDT to start

How much Cl does your base use?

22.5/d

What did I do?


[21-Dec-23 03:47 PM] ohs_#0000
Honestly, This community is way better than any other MMOs I have ever participated in. I do however believe that some of this friendlyness will go away when more people join the game and there are more money sinks for the top players


[21-Dec-23 03:47 PM] ohs_#0000
for example, at the moment the majority of top players money sinks are helping out newer players and planet governance


[21-Dec-23 03:48 PM] ohs_#0000
but eventually more money sinks will appear and the grants will most likely dissapear


[21-Dec-23 03:48 PM] ohs_#0000
atleast some of them


[21-Dec-23 04:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
Makes sense. When you say more money sinks, do you mean more sort of end game features, or just more new players with roughly the same supply of grants?


[21-Dec-23 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Money sinks as in what takes money out of the game.


[21-Dec-23 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the minute there's very few things that take money out of play.


[21-Dec-23 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Market Makers on some commodities, HQ upgrades and APEX level upgrades.


[21-Dec-23 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
You could count consumable upkeep for planets and such but I don't.


[21-Dec-23 04:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was kinda wondering about inflation in the game in the longer term. It doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs many ways to add money into the game either, except maybe for market makers again?


[21-Dec-23 04:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
And 40k per new player


[21-Dec-23 04:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or any faction quests where money in > money out

Alpha started in 2017, ended in 2018 with first access, turned free to play (they opened up the "free" part of the game instead of forcing pro") in 2019, and updated through to 2023 within early access.

There's no real limitation as to where you can go, minus the starter planets that are full on plots.

You could go up there. It isn't *advised* since it'd take maybe weeks to get a ship there, but, you could do it if you wanted to.

i def enjoy the idea of setting up a satellite base at one of the two frontier regions but there's definitely a ton of lower hanging fruit out there so seems like more of a thing you'd do for bragging rights

looking at 600k with both luxuries being funded, and then like 65k for 5 days worth of worker consumables

But the base would be self sufficent but it would be ~60/day

or with MAI and no luxuries its 67/day @ 750k


[31-Dec-23 01:15 AM] avalock#0000
with luxuries its 84/day

KOM is Kombucha, Settlers use it as a lux consumable.


[31-Dec-23 04:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
ANT supply of KOM often isn't as big as the demand for KOM so the prices can get really high.


[31-Dec-23 04:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
It has settled down now to 1k but it was up to 5k per unit of KOM not too long ago.


[31-Dec-23 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
That'd mean.. 50k a day cost just for KOM on a 1000 SET base.

Iron is much less cost efficient than AL.

ahhh darn


[03-Jan-24 01:09 PM] limp_wristed#0000
or maybe a carbon farm on etherwind, but logistics would be more difficult


[03-Jan-24 01:09 PM] avalock#0000
my reasoning was because it seemed like it was use on quite a bit of stuff

[03-Jan-24 01:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Iron would be good if it wasn't for a very volatile market and also the space requirement to transport it.

[03-Jan-24 01:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
AL doesn't sell for much less than FE, and even sometimes sells for more, but takes up MUCH less space in both raw and AL form.

carbon needs to go down quite a bit for it to be cheaper in AI1 than the other 3 CX. I consume a little bit too, though less than i'd produce if i farmed carbon

[03-Jan-24 01:12 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're going for carbon you can mine ALO at the same time on Nascent. at least, that's what i do

it was ~600/u in november


[03-Jan-24 01:47 PM] jvaler#0000

Isn't it something like 48hrs awake is equivalent to being drunk? Similar to being under depth in the ocean (Except ~~that~~ thats nitrogen narcosis or something)

Nitrogen Narcosis or the Benz, depends


[05-Jan-24 04:00 PM] cdgwaddell#0000

oooh that I didn't know, I thought they were different things cause I learned the reason they use Trimix is at a certain depth the further you go the drunker you feel from the nitrogen narcosis

When your underwater the pressure pushes nitrogen in-between the hemoglobin and rapid expansion can rip the blood cells and lymphatic cells apart. Rather funny when it happens to someone else, not so funny when it happens to you, kind like depression drinking

Grants are done through a queue system, so currently you'd be 3rd in place for a grant, so it should get fulfilled relatively soon-ish.

Was it through AGP or was it through Cataclism's own project?


[09-Jan-24 08:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
If it wasn't through AGP you still get the 250,000k on top of whatever Cataclism gave to you.


[09-Jan-24 08:07 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
I am unsure where the funds came from if they were AGP or Cataclisms.


[09-Jan-24 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
From the looks of it, no, it was through Cataclism and his base planning.


[09-Jan-24 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
So we'll consider you in need of 250,000 at the minute.


[09-Jan-24 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Either way, it'll go towards the 750,000 goal for everyone regardless, so it doesn't matter even if you had received it.


[09-Jan-24 08:09 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Okay, I will accept it and earmark the money for later usage / future project.

Depending on the end needs of the project we should already have 3 bases offered up for C, that being
1 x Avacyn
1 x Waddles 
1 x Red
(I may be wrong, I cannot read what I wrote)
Plus 3 that we may or may not use


[10-Jan-24 08:37 AM] avalock#0000

Up to you, but C Might be safer for capital


[10-Jan-24 08:39 AM] avalock#0000

@avalock i don't really know much about what metals are good or profitable other than what i've already told you about SI. i've basically been doing max AL smelting on deimos my entire time playing, and my vulcan base is ""contracted out"" running FS recipes for someone else doing ship prod. which isn't very reflective of actual market demand lol

okay so i've got the 20 BMP base materials together but i actually have no idea what i want to do with it. 20 BMPs worth of REP is so overkill i'd crash the market trying to sell it all


[15-Jan-24 11:53 PM] jvaler#0000
also i have no clue where i'd get that many MFK from anyways. there's like none on CXOB

PE and MCG are where it's at, but also, 20 BMPs running REP is probably not enough to crash the market (it's what I'm about to do...) right now. Demand is high at the moment and that's good money. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[31-Jan-24 12:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Upgrading to LHP is about all that's worth doing in that regard, until you begin building another ship.


[31-Jan-24 12:19 PM] avalock#0000
ahhhhhhh


[31-Jan-24 12:19 PM] shagie#0000
FTL speed is a function of ship volume.  It gets _worse_ as the ship gets bigger.  For fuel and speed (SCB < MCB = WCB < LCB < VCB) - lower is better.
STL speed is related to acceleration and engine ... but avoid upgrading the engine on a starter ship since that's a $$$ piece and the standard isn't bad.


[31-Jan-24 12:20 PM] avalock#0000
yeah i just want to move more ALO

[31-Jan-24 12:22 PM] shagie#0000
Key things with WCB upgrade for starter - it has the minimum replacement cost.  The bridge and crew quarters stay the same... and that's another $$$ part of ugprade.  FTL emitters are a minor change, but not too bad (FTL emitter upgrade for going to a LCB gets more $$$ ... and it needs a larger CQ which is again more $$$)


[31-Jan-24 12:22 PM] avalock#0000
i unfortunately dont have the money to upgrade yet but maybe soon :hehe:


[31-Jan-24 12:23 PM] shagie#0000
The reason that you want a WCB rather than MCB for ALO and AL is that they are heavier than they are massive.


[31-Jan-24 12:23 PM] avalock#0000
yeee that makes sense


[31-Jan-24 12:25 PM] shagie#0000
You can carry 1000 AL in a WCB (2.7t / 1m3) with m3 being the limit.  You can only carry 740 in a LCB (even though its 'bigger' for the m3 dimension, that one gets hit with a limit on the t because its more than 2).


[31-Jan-24 12:26 PM] shagie#0000
You'll see similar things with hauling C (2.25 t / 1m)  and even rations (0.21 t/ 0.1 m3) where the WCB is the better choice for low tier massive stuff.


[31-Jan-24 12:27 PM] shagie#0000

Quick thing here:

Since we've had a massive influx of people and individuals from a wide-variety of planets our role system is somewhat outdated to cope with them all. As such, if there's any you are interested in being added, please let me know and I'll make them a role! At the same time, if you end up making a new base, just let me or a Coordinator know and we'll add the role to you.

Associate role fills that purpose, I was moreso meaning the planetary roles.


[03-Feb-24 09:18 AM] shagie#0000
Fair 'nuff.  I was thinking that associates were people within Greater Antares and a base ... and observers were people who were just here for the chat but didn't have any bases in the area. ... And Boucher isn't Greater Antares... right?


[03-Feb-24 09:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Associate is for people who aren't in ANT and are looking to move there, or otherwise, just those interested in viewing the Discord.

[03-Feb-24 09:32 AM] shagie#0000
It could.  It was designed for a particular style of game play and has been trying to get into the real world business use cases and community hosting... but with awkward funding models (and layoffs)  Slack has been doing anti-nonpaying user things for a while but they've got a solid business model, but if you're not paying some of its choices grate on the user and its _really_ intended for corporate structures.  Perrsonally, I like Zulip because its slack like and self hostable ... but there is strong inertia to discord because you can do easy cross discord links.

Thinking revamp of the channels, maybe a new automated role system for bases, updated spreadsheets for AGP, creating a spreadsheet for internal marketing listing, creating one for our shipping project, and looking into adding some more information to #associate-information and #deleted-channel to make things clearer.

Which would still get me 11k more than selling at AI1


[19-Feb-24 10:11 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah if you have the time it's honestly worth flying it elsewhere. That's a long time for a ship to be away if you're shipping is struggling, but we could probably coordinate something as ADI to get people's AL flown somewhere more profitable

I'm confused by all these channels. Do you have a guide on what to discuss in each channel? Do you have a guide on what each role means?


[07-Mar-24 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I am pretty confused by it too. Not sure on the distinction of the office/communal area. And bulletin boards tend to be empty. I'm not sure if "member" is higher than "associate". I think associates receive grants and members have taken a more involved step..? But that might be reversed


[07-Mar-24 01:14 PM] flor2081#0000
this layout is mostly copied from the AA server, where members are actually involved in the various projects and have access to more channels and all


[07-Mar-24 01:14 PM] flor2081#0000
and the bulletin channel's are also more active there


[07-Mar-24 01:15 PM] flor2081#0000

Bulletin boards were meant to be used for either important notices or for information.


[07-Mar-24 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I personally thought it made sense when I was making it, and for me it works fine, but it seems to be poor in practice.


[07-Mar-24 02:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think it makes sense when explained. Some of the channels are maybe unnecessary, but might get used more as the group grows. Maybe just a summary of what each role/chennel/category is for on the main #server-information


[07-Mar-24 02:19 PM] jvaler#0000
personally i think having separate associate and member channel categories is pointless and makes the server look way more complicated than it actually is


[07-Mar-24 02:22 PM] jvaler#0000
i assume it's there based on the associate member distinction in AA, but there the member only channels are also basically never used aside from the debt channel


[07-Mar-24 02:28 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Fair, I can't think of many reasons I'd want to discuss something privately with only members. Definitely not just general chat


[07-Mar-24 03:37 PM] flor2081#0000
well sometimes you may want to give a special deal to only people who you know "deserve" it if that makes sense


[07-Mar-24 03:38 PM] flor2081#0000
or only give discounts to people who are actively in the projects here


[07-Mar-24 03:38 PM] flor2081#0000
but yeah in practice it doesn't seem to work very well


[07-Mar-24 03:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah, those are some things that I *do* think deserve a separate space. but idk about the office and communal area and definitely don't think we need 2 bot-spams


[07-Mar-24 03:47 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah in my opinion member-bot-spam can go, communal and office channels merge into one, member bulletin board can also go


[07-Mar-24 03:47 PM] flor2081#0000
project information too, as each project already has an information channel


[07-Mar-24 03:48 PM] flor2081#0000
i'm not sure about doing member and associate internal prices too, I'd just merge that into 1 aswell


[07-Mar-24 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm quite happy with how it is, but if there's enough hate for it it can be changed.


[07-Mar-24 04:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do think everything there has a use and should be there, and I definitely want to keep the separation between Associate and Member categories.


[07-Mar-24 04:28 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't think the roles should go away, just the channels


[07-Mar-24 04:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah I definitely don't 'hate' it, I'm just trowin' ideas around. I also agree with the separation of member/associate

same, nice. I would say I can supply SI too, but I don't have a SME base of my own anymore (until I build Vulcan, but it'll be a while)


[25-Mar-24 12:06 PM] jvaler#0000
SI? for...?


[25-Mar-24 12:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
SEA


[25-Mar-24 12:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
S, SI, and PG

you're talking about BMPs on Hephaestus?

OH yeah i forgot SI was in SEA's recipe lmfao


[25-Mar-24 12:13 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah, I've got a stockpile at ANT for electronics on Phobos, but I don't produce it anymore. So idk how much I can SEll yet

I will be starting the Antares Initiative Shipping Insurance Program (AISIP) sometime over the next week or two in preparation for our shipping project.


[26-Mar-24 09:46 AM] talryk#0000
Ooooh, how‚Äôs that gonna work? :aerysWut:


[26-Mar-24 10:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Passive thing where through select regular LM or ADI people who ship will have their transports insured, so that should one party or the other fail to deliver, ADI will cover the costs.


[26-Mar-24 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
It'll work both ways so neither ends up getting screwed over, but the main benefit is for the people who regularly use the LM to ship contracts so that if a new player picks up their contract and quit, they don't end up losing out on their capital.


[26-Mar-24 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
This won't be too useful I suspect nor will there be much use often, but in the event something does occur, it'll be there.


[26-Mar-24 10:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
And it'll pave the way for our eventual shipping program of itself, in which I'd like to get regular shipments done specifically from the big planets like ANT to Deimos, Harmonia, Heph, Phobos, Nike, etc. and then expand it to the further out planets as we can.


[26-Mar-24 10:16 AM] talryk#0000
Getting big shipping lanes set. I like it!


[26-Mar-24 10:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's the goal.


[26-Mar-24 10:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm looking into how I can feasibly create such a thing and accurately display the progress of the shipping, or at least how to make it into a viable system that people feel is intuitive and useful to use.


[26-Mar-24 10:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
At the moment I've got plans to fund several people for either ship upgrades so they can work partially within the program, or for entirely new ships for it specifically.


[26-Mar-24 10:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you're planning on charging premiums / holding reserves for it, let me know. I actually do insurance in real life (unfortunately) so I can probably point you in the right direction. Though I'd imagine it'd be tough to price accurately since there's not a great way to estimate the risks involved


[26-Mar-24 10:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't personally plan on forcing any charge.


[26-Mar-24 10:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll be doing it out of pocket.


[26-Mar-24 10:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
The smart thing would probably be to charge a fee - but at the same time, since there's no real accurate way to divide funding and also a lack of transparency, and since that kinda goes against the whole idea of the Discord - I'd rather avoid that can of worms and just take the hits myself.


[26-Mar-24 10:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
holding reserves, then üòÑ

I‚Äôm hoping to offer some of that for sale here soon, once I have a big enough pile at ANT. I think cheap DDT can be helpful to farmers early on as a capital boost, and it‚Äôs not really super liquid on the CX

Submit a request for something to be shipped, it gets matched with a shipper who is available?, send contract ?

You could put a tiny bit of collateral into the contract?


[26-Mar-24 10:54 AM] talryk#0000
You know, I actually had this idea of having basically a shipping company dispatch sort of setup. Not sure how much people would take to that, though


[26-Mar-24 10:54 AM] coolfeather2#0000
Idk if you can set custom contracts up in-game or if they have to follow a template?

There is a flights endpoint to see a users current ship flight status and theres a ships endpoint for general ship data

Or just have them be manually updated.

As you have preset source and destinations, you can just manually set those based on ship Configs?

[26-Mar-24 02:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think exact distances from place to place, the fuel cost, and the arrival time can all be predicted from FIO if you have enough time. When getting info on a planet it gives you info on the orbit too and `/systemstars/jumproute/` gives you the distance in parsecs between sectors

[26-Mar-24 07:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It would be neat to have but I don't envy whoever needs to learn about orbital mechanics to simulate the motion of planets in every system on the path from the grocery store to your base

Sometimes, i feel like Alice in the wonderland, when I'm reading your conversation üòÖ


[26-Mar-24 07:41 PM] coolfeather2#0000
I don't think we need to be that accurate
Plus the fuel sliders are hard to get accurate results every time 
Don't know how that will factor in
But distance between would be good to estimate a rough cost for travel


[26-Mar-24 07:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well at least the FF cost should be pretty much already determined if you know the parsec distance, unless there isn't a direct "X parsecs traveled means Y fuel used"


[26-Mar-24 07:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And the default STL option when you plan a flight is usually 100-150 SF no matter the path


[26-Mar-24 08:14 PM] talryk#0000
Well the ‚ÄúX parsecs meaning Y fuel‚Äù also has to take the reactor slider into account, and that says nothing about differing FTL engines. But the orbital mechanics should be theoretically pretty easy, once the orbital period is established.


[26-Mar-24 08:16 PM] talryk#0000
Assuming that the azimuth and headings remain relatively constant between systems. Those would have to be determined ahead of time


[26-Mar-24 08:17 PM] talryk#0000
Er, bearings. Not headings.

Since my available toolset is pretty limited while I‚Äôm at work, I‚Äôve been just playing with experimental calculations based on Deimos‚Äô orbital parameters, and I‚Äôve noticed something peculiar. Based on the numbers and Milo‚Äôs claim that planetary movements are 20x faster in-game, Deimos should orbit in about 27 minutes. But I‚Äôve been staring at the MS screen, and it hasn‚Äôt moved a bit

[27-Mar-24 02:19 PM] talryk#0000

[27-Mar-24 03:31 PM] talryk#0000
So now the math is telling me 9.41 years for Deimos to make an orbit‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôve fried a wire in my brain somewhere, trying to work this out

It's anywhere between 9 years and 20 minutes

I've safely concluded it is in fact slower than about five minutes.

Anyway back onto the shipping project, perhaps we should start with a dedicated channel for shipping? (Unless I'm blind and there is one already)


[30-Mar-24 11:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
We had one but it got placed within the generalized channel of #trading due to confusion.


[30-Mar-24 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the Discord is overdue a bit of a makeover before we end up committing to anything, as well.


[30-Mar-24 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
For one, GAS needs to go, since that's not going to be a thing as far as I'm aware - unless someone wants to pick up the reigns.


[30-Mar-24 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
And then there needs to be some more bulletin boards written out and embeded as well to properly describe everything.


[30-Mar-24 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
No use in doing that until we have the layout down though.


[30-Mar-24 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm open to any suggestions regarding the layout, although the difference between Associate and Member is definitely staying since I think that's valid.


[30-Mar-24 11:38 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I still don't know the difference. The member channels are hardly ever used


[30-Mar-24 11:39 AM] jvaler#0000
only cataclism knew what cataclism wanted lol. idk what there is *to* pick up


[30-Mar-24 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Mar-24 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
Associates are people who are in the Discord, they are either not within Antares, do not have a license, or otherwise do not engage with ADI in a meaningful manner - basically just visitors.


[30-Mar-24 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
Members are those that predominantly have received funding through AGP or otherwise directly engage with Antares or ADI as a whole.


[30-Mar-24 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Coordinators are just people who I know and exist, basically.


[30-Mar-24 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Never really came up with much for coordinators.


[30-Mar-24 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Jvaler's duitiful contributions to giving people roles is appreciated though.


[30-Mar-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
i agree with there being a difference, but surely you've noticed how the member channels go basically unused in favor of the associate channels due to the fact that messages reach more people right?


[30-Mar-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
something should be done about that


[30-Mar-24 11:43 AM] jvaler#0000
cause otherwise the channels are just clutter if they aren't used


[30-Mar-24 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the issue is I never enforced member channels being used by people.


[30-Mar-24 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't really want to *enforce* anything, other than the general basics of decency and order.


[30-Mar-24 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Although I admit if we deleted the whole member category, nothing would change.


[30-Mar-24 11:44 AM] jvaler#0000
maybe that has to do with group size and activity. if there was more going on in-house the in-house channels might have more activity lol


[30-Mar-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
ohh that's kinda the deal with AA too. the project channels have activity but the "member" channels don't


[30-Mar-24 11:46 AM] jvaler#0000
maybe members-only channels are only needed if there's projects to be talked about going on?


[30-Mar-24 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I'll probably end up removing the member category, or at least shortening it to maybe two/three channels in the meantime.


[30-Mar-24 11:46 AM] coolfeather2#0000
Yep


[30-Mar-24 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe just leave #member-general #deleted-channel and #deleted-channel.

[30-Mar-24 11:47 AM] jvaler#0000
and maybe #deleted-channel  if we ever want to set up a FIO group for inventory checking

Bulletin and project is empty, do you plan to use it?


[30-Mar-24 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[30-Mar-24 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000

question: what's the difference between the office and communal channels? they seem to be used for interchangeable purposes


[30-Mar-24 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm glad you asked.


[30-Mar-24 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just wrote up a draft message in #associate-information for that exact question until I find the motivation to move it to a refined and polished embed.


[30-Mar-24 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now I admit there's overlap between office and planning, but since we spoke so much in both indiscriminantly I was hesitant to shorten it down into one.


[30-Mar-24 11:56 AM] jvaler#0000
oh perfect lol


[30-Mar-24 11:57 AM] jvaler#0000
i think they have their place. base planning and theorizing can kinda be separate from the rest of the intracacies of the game


[30-Mar-24 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll have a think about how to better visualize that into writing.


[30-Mar-24 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
I must admit getting ideas from head to keyboard isn't my strong point.


[30-Mar-24 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
But yes there is definitely a use in seperating the two.


[30-Mar-24 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now I do have one question.


[30-Mar-24 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the interim before we sort the logo situation, do we still like this one we are using now or would we rather go back to the regular Antares faction logo?


[30-Mar-24 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was in a rush to part myself from the game's logo for reasons but this one didn't grow on me like I thought it would.


[30-Mar-24 12:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the logo is just inoffensive. just using the default antares logo is a bit unoriginal


[30-Mar-24 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree with the default one being unoriginal.


[30-Mar-24 12:01 PM] bojangles_1#0000
It doesn't bother me either. Gets the point across. Mars and stuff


[30-Mar-24 12:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

Doesn't say "development" to me


[30-Mar-24 12:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since this is all about development, we could do some sort of stylized sunrise on mars


[30-Mar-24 12:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Current one doesn't either, I thought it would work as interim logo


[30-Mar-24 12:06 PM] jvaler#0000
it's grown on me but i'm down for whatever. i just don't think using the antares faction logo works cause this group isn't the antares initiative, just an advocacy group for it


[30-Mar-24 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
The person who I was looking into making a logo for us that has a similiar project going on for prun ended up using AI for their logo.


[30-Mar-24 12:08 PM] coolfeather2#0000
I thought office was like an "administrative" building for developing the group 
Planning was for smaller projects and base discussion
Communal area was just general


[30-Mar-24 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Mar-24 12:18 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
One thing i would like to put forward is clearing up #internal-offers .
i feel like that should only be for posting your prices and nothing else, potentially if you're giving away free materials or something but deleting the advert once you've finished giving away or you run out etc.

i just feel like atm there is alot of clutter messages clogging it up.
main thing being, post your prices/giveaways, keep your business deals/ general trade talk for #trading or #member-trading


[30-Mar-24 12:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree with this.

[30-Mar-24 12:19 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
because even if your prices change or your stock changes, you just edit the message so there is no real reason it should be crammed up with stuff really.


[30-Mar-24 12:22 PM] coolfeather2#0000

It might have become like that due to people not understanding how it operates

Not to speak for everyone, but I think many of us are willing to help out. But again ultimately up to you how you want that to be implemented


[30-Mar-24 02:38 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah i get that, even if you made it so coordinators are in some sense moderators to an extent, able to delete messages or something they'd be able to keep on top of the clutter or something. 
But yeah i understand your view towards that.

Ok, so I have an etremely rough sketch for a flag idea. Three circles representing the Mars system, with a sledge hammer laid in the center. A smattering a smaller circles in the lower right representing the myriad of planets now occupied by the Initiative. The gray parts are where I'm probably going to shade the flag. I'll post the sketch in a moment.

Thoughts?


[30-Mar-24 09:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What about putting the hammer + moons lower down and then the myriad planets fill up the upper portion, being cut off by the border to imply there are many


[30-Mar-24 09:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The 2 moons at the bottom as the start of Antares and then the many new planets to follow above, you know ?


[30-Mar-24 09:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
ooh, thats cool. yeah I like that concept and those suggestions


[30-Mar-24 09:09 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Yeah, Lemme adjust real fast to get an idea of what its going to look like. I"ll post the result in a moment


[30-Mar-24 09:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If you are planning on shading and a less minimalist look, then an aluminum sheen somewhere feels appropriate. Don't know how you are going to style it


[30-Mar-24 09:12 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Was actually debating on doing it in a charcoal brush style. Been messing around with that drawing style. I really like it and this will just give me some more practice


[30-Mar-24 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I kinda like the idea that instead of the sledgehammer we have the main part of the AI logo perhaps.

[30-Mar-24 09:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I was thinking the new planets would be about the size in the first picture and the hammer would be just reaching the middle


[30-Mar-24 09:19 PM] bojangles_1#0000

I think the goal of ADI is to help people get a start or expand in Antares, not to be an exclusive corp. But I think that helping people start a *new* Antares based corp is 100% in line with the goal here. If you guys want to go for it let me know. I can help get you set up with some of the discord tools and other stuff that many corps use to organize themselves

Australis is in OOG, works with AA projects, and helps here. I'm in KAWA, part of an AA project, and help here. Obviously being part of ADI isn't an exclusive thing, just a loose collective of people helping each other out

[01-Apr-24 04:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[01-Apr-24 04:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
meh, there's plenty of reasons to want to start a corp beyond the internal market and some other stuff. Since there's not really any mechanical benefit in game people start "corps" for all sorts of out of game social reasons too

[14-Apr-24 04:48 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
Either way, spent my first couple of days getting my bearings - got a second smelter and stocked up on consumables, should be good for about 2 weeks now chipping away at AL production‚Ä¶. Otherwise i just do contracts and wait for the numbers to go up. I guess thats all i can do for now right?


[14-Apr-24 12:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah, maybe plan next bases


[14-Apr-24 12:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, AL Deimos is one of the least profitable starts. So any other base you make will be making more money


[14-Apr-24 12:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Speaking from experience


[14-Apr-24 12:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We might be planning to spam a bunch of PG bases soon so you might want to jump on for your next base

Hardly one of the least profitable.

Think we went through this already in the official Discord.


[14-Apr-24 12:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yes and my opinion didn't change. I updated the graph and it's still the bottom of the barrel by a significant margin and it has been this way since I joined. I gotta do something else rn so I won't argue more


[14-Apr-24 12:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Either way, Metzger, AL into Bfabs is extremely profitable and can net you a solid income.


[14-Apr-24 12:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Deimos to Nike is also pretty easy on shipping, too.


[14-Apr-24 12:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Shipping requirements also go down quite a bit when translating from AL to bfab so you can let it stockpile for a while and ship it all at once.


[14-Apr-24 12:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not to mention a full Nike base of pp2s is pretty easy on consumables, and Deimos smelting only requires pio consumables which are relatively abundant and aren't too expensive either.


[14-Apr-24 12:54 PM] jvaler#0000
ngl i can't agree with this anymore. looking at the numbers nowadays 25-30k/d for a minmaxxed base is pretty pitiful


[14-Apr-24 12:56 PM] jvaler#0000
AL @ 550/u is a much bigger difference than i thought


[14-Apr-24 12:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm holding firm on the point that Deimos is a great starter with good prospects for profit.

I'm not really an expert or that much of an analyst, but with the vertical integration that I have going on my supply chain, each individual AL unit costs ~285 AIC to make

You'll be doing plenty of waiting regardless of where you start off.


[14-Apr-24 01:04 PM] jvaler#0000
definitely disagree. other starts just make you better money for your investment, which makes you grow faster. FRMs are very cheap(great ROI period) and have about the same returns as AL SME right now


[14-Apr-24 01:04 PM] jvaler#0000
if not better depending on what you make


[14-Apr-24 01:05 PM] jvaler#0000
last i checked my 13 FRM harmonia base was ~35k/d making GRN & HCP

Doesn't invalidate Deimos as a solid starter.

You have stable income, good market, good location, and the ability to vertically integrate further.

And the market for bfabs is very strong.


[14-Apr-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
bfabs aren't a consideration for deimos metallurgy start without a loan/grant


[14-Apr-24 01:07 PM] jvaler#0000
though maybe a lot of the value is in the fact that deimos has no more plots

Leslie managed a base with no grant.

Either way, I think I'm going to be firm on my Deimos opinion, not least because it is probably the only reason I'm at the place I am now and had I picked any other planet I probably wouldn't still be playing.

It worked fine for me and I still hold the opinion it'll work fine for others and opens the door for plenty of options.

the market's changed though. AL isn't at 600/u anymore and probably won't be for a while

[14-Apr-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000

SME base is pretty cheap. I just think we already won the cheap AL fight and we should guide new players towards other materials if they are interested. Maybe one day we would have cheap AL and the cheapest PG in the universe too

i think looking at vertical integration and ignoring individual bases' profits is a mistake. 

you have to think of the AL you make as if you were selling it, because that's how much you're "saving" in costs of buying it


[14-Apr-24 02:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Daisy chain production for PG. It is used in tons of common mats from DW to bfabs and would complement cheap AL. The most costly material in making PG is C so it makes sense focusing on producing it in house in order to not mess with CX (I think the price rn is alright, if anything maybe should be a bit more expensive). Should be 3 groups, people on Harmonia making agri products, then a yet unknown planet burning for carbon and then the last group spamming POL somewhere, maybe Elon. New players can start and be helping immediately along any step.

No concrete numbers on how many of each group are required and how much of the weekly trade we need to be making to affect the price

Same boat, but if your newer (I am too) it seems like most in game corps are defunct / people don‚Äôt use them, probably since there‚Äôs no real advantages to them. I was told to check the ufo when I asked what you were asking while looking and I found this one instead.

if you've got all the stuff you just need to ship it to a shipyard and it'll take like 1 day to actually build

Is that a similar process ? I mean take the required items to a shipyard (and then maybe there is an upgrade button ?)

yes you can make an upgrade blueprint with the command `BLU`

[22-Apr-24 11:55 AM] evany.#0000
a more general question - flying/fuel wise is there a way to get 'optimal' for longest time i just sent ships at the 'default' but it seems like if you tinker with the bars you can get them to go lower and still be faster in some situations


[22-Apr-24 11:55 AM] evany.#0000
is there a way to reliably select the cheapest/fastest (optimal) fuel levels?


[22-Apr-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
not that I know of, you just have to click around a bit until you get the shorter route


[22-Apr-24 01:10 PM] jvaler#0000
there's a known bug where theres 2 separate flight paths your ship can take, and clicking anywhere on the fuel bars will randomize between the two. (randomized but not always 50/50 for unknown reasons)

one of the paths is most often strictly superior to the other, so it's always good to compare both.
in my experience this superiority doesn't exist in STL-only flights

Is it possible to increase production order queue capacity beyond five slots?


[03-May-24 01:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah. Upgrade your base HQ. Not sure when the first one is tho


[03-May-24 01:37 PM] darkgineer#0000
Thanks, found it in manual:
> Levels 5, 10, 13, 16, 18 and 20 grant you additional queue slots to make managing your production queues easier.

Do you mean as in a second ALO extraction base?


[06-May-24 11:05 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Or just another extractor on your current base?


[06-May-24 11:05 AM] avalock#0000
another base


[06-May-24 11:05 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000

Well let me know when you start stocking up ALO, cause I‚Äôll buy it off you, you name a price and I‚Äôll pay it

Any reason not to upgrade a ship to WCB + LHP ? I was planning on doing that soon for both my ships


[06-May-24 06:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
super worth it. I also usually recommend MFL too, gives you more range for possible CX to CX travel (or similar long distances, without haveing to fill up at every stop)


[06-May-24 06:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe I'll add an MFL eventually but I have never once sent a ship to another CX and I don't see myself doing that rn. As long as I can get to another CX and refuel I don't care really

my deimos base is mostly empty, i was thinking of making it an extraction/smelting base and exporting the AL, would it be more beneficial to just focus on extraction and sell raw ALO?


[07-May-24 10:57 AM] avalock#0000
imo would be good to set up a simulation if you want ALO mining or AL smelting only with like prunplanner

Projects are set up differently. Everyone runs them on their own set of rules


[11-May-24 03:05 PM] realharvey#0000
Projects have the advantage, that you can run multiple bases on the same planet with different users to be permit efficient


[11-May-24 03:06 PM] realharvey#0000
In alot of projects multiple people work together to create everything for one thing they want to produce


[11-May-24 03:06 PM] realharvey#0000
and everything of that endmaterial that is produced is split between everyone


[11-May-24 03:07 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000

those projects are setup in a way that it's beneficial for everyone involved. They give newer people quite a headstart


[11-May-24 03:10 PM] realharvey#0000
you could use such a project to start with a steady source of income with low risk and fund your own adventures with that


[11-May-24 03:15 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
hmm, i'm not too sure. i've never really seen a project that i'd want to get invested in. I'm mainly focusing on plastics and looking to govern a planet, so i don't want to get myself bogged down. i think defo in the future i'll maybe look into it

how many major pipelines would you say the antares area has?


[13-May-24 03:15 PM] realharvey#0000
what do you mean by pipelines?


[13-May-24 03:16 PM] realharvey#0000
do you mean the ANT to HRT route? Or in System shipping?


[13-May-24 03:16 PM] tanda#0000
well, for example, I know of Harmonia>Nascent>Deimos>Nike


[13-May-24 03:17 PM] flor2081#0000
boucher>harmonia>norwick


[13-May-24 03:18 PM] flor2081#0000
well, there's lots of planets with the same CoGC so I think people just kindof choose whatever


[13-May-24 03:19 PM] jvaler#0000
harmonia doesn't really need boucher... i think that's only the case in AFC because it's right next to life's HYF


[13-May-24 03:20 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah true, put life somewhere in there too then üòÑ


[13-May-24 03:24 PM] tanda#0000
do you guys import water from boucher to harmonia due to lack of infrastructure on Ice Station Alpha?


[13-May-24 03:25 PM] tanda#0000
seems like a lot further to travel for water


[13-May-24 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
I bring it from Etherwind ü•≤


[13-May-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
we do it in a big project, and mining on boucher is a lot more efficient so it uses less permits (RIG is way better than EXT), and we just have a dedicated person for shipping


[13-May-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
but if you're just doing FRM you don't need a full boucher base, etherwind or ice station alpha should be fine for that


[13-May-24 03:29 PM] jvaler#0000
RIG vs EXT doesn't apply to boucher vs ISA cause both are rigs


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] jvaler#0000
despite the name...


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
oh what


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
which dipshit named it ice station


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] jvaler#0000
ikr


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
okay my bad


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] jvaler#0000
the main difference between the two is the hostile conditions of ISA


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] jvaler#0000
HSE on 35 rigs is pain


[13-May-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
then this should scare you off plenty üòÑ

[13-May-24 03:31 PM] jvaler#0000
right


[13-May-24 03:32 PM] jvaler#0000
though tbh i'd take HSE rigs > needing extra LCBs to compensate for the distance to boucher


[13-May-24 03:32 PM] jvaler#0000
but rise is also a shipbuilder so their situation is probably different. they seem to have infinite logi capacity


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] flor2081#0000
haha true true


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] flor2081#0000
did he say he makes like 1 ship a day? or was that a week


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] jvaler#0000
it was per day iirc


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] flor2081#0000
oh yeah he said per day


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] flor2081#0000
thats a lot actually


[13-May-24 03:33 PM] flor2081#0000
who buys all that


[13-May-24 03:34 PM] jvaler#0000
who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[13-May-24 03:35 PM] jvaler#0000
well actually 1 person knows


[13-May-24 03:36 PM] flor2081#0000
prob just roganartu and memory constantly expanding haha


[13-May-24 03:38 PM] realharvey#0000
rise said he got some large orders in recently


[13-May-24 03:38 PM] realharvey#0000
guys being crazy ordering multiple ships at once


[13-May-24 03:39 PM] flor2081#0000
hah yeah thats kindof how it goes when you've got enough money, I ran out of ship space a couple weeks ago, got mad and instantly bought 3 ships


[13-May-24 03:40 PM] realharvey#0000
lol I never have any liquid cash really to be able to even get one ship


[13-May-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
rise accepts purchases on credit


[13-May-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
to be paid off... whenever


[13-May-24 03:40 PM] realharvey#0000
I know


[13-May-24 03:40 PM] flor2081#0000
oh yeah he does

[13-May-24 03:41 PM] realharvey#0000
but I cant order 3 ships like that :D


[13-May-24 03:41 PM] jvaler#0000
well 3 is a lot lmao


[13-May-24 03:41 PM] tanda#0000
I guess it's better than having all those assets sitting around when you're the top dog, huh


[13-May-24 03:41 PM] flor2081#0000
no cause now I'm poor üòÑ


[13-May-24 03:41 PM] flor2081#0000
who'd have thought feeding 3 people's bases is kindof expensive (looking at you harvey)


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] realharvey#0000
yeah because you've indirectly build 6 Bases in a short time frame


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] flor2081#0000
hahah timing


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] realharvey#0000
I am totally innocent


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] realharvey#0000
I got caught in a I want to make big  RAT pyramid scheme


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] flor2081#0000
its going better than I expected though


[13-May-24 03:42 PM] flor2081#0000
am happy


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
wait what's SEARC?
south eastern antares... something something?


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] flor2081#0000
that was merged to become HCC


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
oh huh


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] flor2081#0000
that was the fk-794d projects


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
ohhhhhh


[13-May-24 03:43 PM] flor2081#0000
making rat/dw/cof like the prom/avalon projects


[13-May-24 03:44 PM] flor2081#0000
so they merged because they did the exact same (besides fim/mea)


[13-May-24 03:44 PM] flor2081#0000
i think south eastern antares rat cooperation?


[13-May-24 03:44 PM] flor2081#0000
not sure about the R, something like that


[13-May-24 03:44 PM] jvaler#0000
sounds about right


[13-May-24 03:44 PM] realharvey#0000
but what could go possibly wrong there?


[13-May-24 03:46 PM] flor2081#0000
haha

apparently someone else made buildings at the same time as me


[13-May-24 03:47 PM] flor2081#0000
still I set up earlier than I originally planned so I dont mind waiting a week, and someone just fulfilled all popi so next week will be fine


[13-May-24 03:48 PM] jvaler#0000
i see an opportunity for a real south eastern agri co-op now üßê

uh you mean afc? i dont get it üòÖ


[13-May-24 04:04 PM] jvaler#0000

i made a pikachu in the sheet

but demeter/hermes *are* east

ah right

in the AFC sheet? that thing is impossible to navigate

thought they wouldnt appreciate it if I did it in an active one


[13-May-24 04:06 PM] flor2081#0000
honestly I've got half my bases there but I don't know the planets in antares


[13-May-24 04:07 PM] flor2081#0000
I'm always very surprised when my deimos->ant goes so much faster than elon or something

insitor influence... üòë

Vote Antaren no matter Who :Salute:


[13-May-24 04:12 PM] flor2081#0000
8 now, but like half of my bases are CAAP/HCC so most supplies are done by rise and rog


[13-May-24 04:13 PM] flor2081#0000
and i've been strongly neglecting my adalina/berthier/curie bases, just started them up again yesterday


[13-May-24 04:13 PM] jvaler#0000

i forget who it was and where though


[13-May-24 04:17 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
When should you ideally begin repairing buildings?


[13-May-24 04:17 PM] flor2081#0000
hm, that couldve been me yes


[13-May-24 04:17 PM] flor2081#0000
uh, bit before they reach 33%


[13-May-24 04:17 PM] flor2081#0000
i think thats literally the bottom


[13-May-24 04:18 PM] flor2081#0000
ideally at around 90 days, or 45


[13-May-24 04:18 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
My Phobos PIO are probably eating eachother by now üòÇ


[13-May-24 04:18 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I only fill it up once my stock of SIO runs low


[13-May-24 04:18 PM] flor2081#0000
but depends on the planet's conditions, it always rounds up so sometimes when you have stuff like TSH it will be best to repair at 30 days instead of 45

[14-May-24 03:36 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[14-May-24 03:37 PM] avalock#0000

[14-May-24 03:38 PM] jvaler#0000
what planet did you have in mind?


[14-May-24 03:38 PM] avalock#0000
nascent probably, ALO is my most profitable


[14-May-24 03:39 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[14-May-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
i can see it, but my nascent base's ratios are already perfect for me :/


[14-May-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
if anything i might put it down on ISA when i finally make a base there


[14-May-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
but i bet others have a nascent HQ, i'd ask around in UFO or planetary chat maybe

Can someone explain, teach me how to read such charts or point me to a guide of sorts? I'm kinda dumb in these ways, *father only taught me to write code*.

you wanna know how candles work?


[15-May-24 07:07 PM] darkgineer#0000
*They burn, ain't they?*


[15-May-24 07:10 PM] avalock#0000
The green is buying, red is selling, 

Low - Lowest point something was bought or sold
Open - Where the price was at the start of that segment
Close - The price was at the close of the segment
High - Highest point something was bought or sold

the bottom is for volume, it's general buying or selling volume

SMA (10) is the simple moving average across the last 10 segments


[15-May-24 07:12 PM] avalock#0000

[15-May-24 07:12 PM] avalock#0000
what you have on the top right


[15-May-24 07:12 PM] avalock#0000
so each candle stick is 4 hours worth of trading


[15-May-24 07:13 PM] darkgineer#0000
Uh-huh. If green is buying, what does four consecutive green candles on my screenshot mean? In like generic language.


[15-May-24 07:14 PM] avalock#0000
the opens were higher than the closes :hehe:

i think this is my last aluminum mine expansion for a bit, then its saving time for ship parts


[16-May-24 09:30 AM] avalock#0000
:0_think: is it possible to make a contract with yourself for budgeting


[16-May-24 09:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt think so - are you just trying to save a certain amount for ship parts?


[16-May-24 09:40 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[16-May-24 09:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
I usually just track it in a Google sheet or something like that: bank account - saved for ship = available cash


[16-May-24 09:43 AM] realharvey#0000
You can put up a very cheap buy order for a product. Money will be subtracted and nobody will ever fill that


[16-May-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
Also, if you have an estimate of how much you can save per week, I could do a 0% loan so you pay back about that amount per week. Up to you though üôÇ


[16-May-24 09:47 AM] avalock#0000

Do you know how to upgrade ships & such?


[16-May-24 09:55 AM] avalock#0000
yeeeee, i‚Äôm thinking of doing a like step by step process, fuel saving engine + wcb the rest build on later


[16-May-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs a good plan. Upgrading to LHP is well worth the money later on as well. I actually still need to do that on two of my ships


[16-May-24 09:56 AM] avalock#0000

[16-May-24 10:24 AM] avalock#0000
with some BHP and SSC


[16-May-24 10:24 AM] realharvey#0000
go with LHP instead of BHP


[16-May-24 10:25 AM] realharvey#0000
LHP is in almost all cases better than BHP in the current ship meta


[16-May-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
yeah i just wanted to have small changes on the stuff i wanted first :hehe:


[16-May-24 10:31 AM] realharvey#0000
You shouldn't upgrade a ship in smaller steps


[16-May-24 10:32 AM] realharvey#0000
You'll waste material this way unfortunately


[16-May-24 10:32 AM] realharvey#0000
no materials gets refunded when upgrading

just be careful of the traded volume - unless you plan to use the HAL yourself, you'll drive the price down really quickly

I love sci-fi that explores interesting questions without actually trying to "answer" them. Build a whole world/scenario around a "what if" then just explore that space. After the first book he goes on to answer to many of the questions explored in Dune and his answers kinda sucked imo

[24-May-24 08:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000

man, why is FIO so unreliable? It works great but not all the time


[24-May-24 09:21 PM] jvaler#0000
it's been pretty reliable for the past few months, at least ever since they got past those constant issues back in october(?). hasn't been anything in the FIO server status channel in PCT for a few months


[25-May-24 01:09 AM] akyantor#0000
Made a schoolboy error yesterday. Didn't properly read a logistics contract and assumed the drop off was the market... only to realise it was YK-266... where I have no reason to go. :S


[25-May-24 01:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well


[25-May-24 01:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Now you have a reason


[25-May-24 01:11 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah well, lost use of that ship for a couple of days. üôÇ


[25-May-24 11:56 AM] chobbycock#0000
Is there anyone that could help me out getting my first 2k2k upgrade?


[25-May-24 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Generally it‚Äôs better to upgrade to the WCB the 1k volume 3k weight one


[25-May-24 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs drastically cheaper


[25-May-24 11:58 AM] chobbycock#0000
I was planning on doing one high volume and one high weight, but the volume one requires a large crew quarters


[25-May-24 11:58 AM] chobbycock#0000
So I thought a 2k2k ight be a good compromise


[25-May-24 11:58 AM] tanda#0000
I don't think there's a good use case for high volume in ANT space right now anyway


[25-May-24 11:58 AM] tanda#0000
certainly not as your second ship


[25-May-24 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think that a 1k3k will be sufficient for now


[25-May-24 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
For both


[25-May-24 12:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For the 2k2k you will also need to get a crew quarters and a bunch of emitters


[25-May-24 12:00 PM] chobbycock#0000
I'm tryna set up a fuel base and also thinking about farming, so I thought high volume would be better for that


[25-May-24 12:01 PM] chobbycock#0000
So a 1k3k is the cheapest and easiet to do then?


[25-May-24 12:07 PM] jvaler#0000
3kt/1km^3*
the 1kt/3km^3 is the most expensive


[25-May-24 12:10 PM] chobbycock#0000
ah yea, thats the one I meant


[25-May-24 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sorry I gots it backwards üòÇ


[25-May-24 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs the WCB one that fits a lot of weight


[25-May-24 01:56 PM] avalock#0000
it's probably annoying to do it like this but :smug:

you might try tiering it out a bit? I'd go for 500's before a bunch of 100's

so maybe like 3 100's and 2 500's

[27-May-24 01:38 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, some people make a LOT of LST there


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess it's quiet heavy, so a pain to move about?


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] avalock#0000
~2.7 tons, not the heaviest tbh


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] jvaler#0000
same as AL


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs not light tho


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But doable


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] tanda#0000
I actually was nearly recruited for running a full LST base on Nike a few months back


[27-May-24 01:39 PM] jvaler#0000
definitely should have a WCB for it


[27-May-24 01:40 PM] jvaler#0000
but that's why nike is such a good construction planet, the LST is right on-site


[27-May-24 01:40 PM] jvaler#0000
so you only have to import 1 heavy thing, AL


[27-May-24 01:40 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, seems like a great fit


[27-May-24 01:41 PM] avalock#0000
:Giggle: that's why I'm tempted to flip it on LM


[27-May-24 01:45 PM] avalock#0000
like if most of the buying volume is aiming at 100-115 on AI1, with people buyiung @ 150 - 170 (high 180, low 130 over 7 days), You could probably aim 130 LST/u and make ~62.5% profit in LM

@Project Associate @Project Member Good evening all! It has come to my realisation that the time for me to leave has come and gone, and as such I'll be handing the title of Interim Administrator over to the wonderful @jvaler . As for what this means in practice, probably not much in the meantime, although ADI will be at the full control of Jvaler should they deem anything necessary.

It has been a real pleasure these past months and I hope you all continue to grow Antares in my stead. :antares_initiative:

yeah, it was one of the starters added to the list after the start of the universe. It's not even technically in CI territory, which is why it can have 0 taxes

also why it's the ultimate move in the Antares takeover to win governorship there then change the currency of taxes to AIC on a CI starter üòù

but yeah, etherwind is a really good but really weird starter


[29-May-24 07:30 PM] copiousdude#0000
Montem and Vallis for sure


[29-May-24 07:33 PM] jvaler#0000
those are the only 2 starters? üßê


[29-May-24 07:34 PM] copiousdude#0000
I think there is one, maybe two more, but I don't KNOW them.


[29-May-24 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000
ah


[29-May-24 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000

[29-May-24 07:34 PM] copiousdude#0000
Sorry, that one got me at first too. There is a list of the starters floating around.


[29-May-24 07:35 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[29-May-24 07:35 PM] copiousdude#0000
Someone posted it in the last few weeks on the official or UFO discord, it gets posted occasionally


[29-May-24 07:36 PM] jvaler#0000
wait i actually don't remember the antares starters myself lmfao. ik there's deimos and phobos... but is harmonia actually a starter?


[29-May-24 07:36 PM] jvaler#0000
surely


[29-May-24 07:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
hmmm, might just be 2?

[29-May-24 07:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's from the old tutorial video though, so it might have had some added later, like Etherwind was


[29-May-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
Harmonia I believe is actually a starter. Lot of newbies on that planet

verdant? that's surprising


[29-May-24 07:38 PM] jvaler#0000
but makes sense, victualler start wouldn't make sense there otherwise


[29-May-24 07:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Umbra I thought might be a starter, Nemesis surprises me. Why does nobody choose Nemesis, lol


[29-May-24 07:39 PM] jvaler#0000
ikr??? nemesis has incredible fertility it's crazy


[29-May-24 07:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
location I guess


[29-May-24 07:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
better fertility than Prox but a few jumps further from CX


[29-May-24 07:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but the H2O concentration...


[29-May-24 07:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Nemesis is great


[29-May-24 07:40 PM] jvaler#0000
FRMs are so easy on logi though it really shouldn't matter. and it's not like you're worrying about distance to CX on the start screen afaik


[29-May-24 07:44 PM] jvaler#0000
well even if i know the starters the bot seems broke so i can't get ranks working üò≠


[29-May-24 07:44 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe i'll ask their discord


[29-May-24 07:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000

its full of love ‚ù§Ô∏è  just spreading the love of Antares


[29-May-24 07:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
listen, I love Antares, but I hate to admit that it's supply of fertile planets is... lacking


[29-May-24 07:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
let Benten and Hortus feed Antares to do cooler things, lol


[29-May-24 07:51 PM] jvaler#0000
hmph


[29-May-24 07:51 PM] jvaler#0000
we have harmonia and demeter


[29-May-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
harmonia is definitely starter


[29-May-24 07:52 PM] jvaler#0000
it certainly is a starter

I didn't realize Demeter is in the KI area though. there's a lot of good stuff around there

KAWA used to get a *ton* of H from KI-401d, and PiBoy uses that whole system for INS now


[29-May-24 08:01 PM] jvaler#0000

[29-May-24 08:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that whole system is undervalued, I think now that you and some other bigger players are developing it we'll see more movement there eventually


[29-May-24 08:03 PM] jvaler#0000
we'll see... have yet to get any hermes converts from demeter planet chat


[29-May-24 08:03 PM] evany.#0000
what do you do out there


[29-May-24 08:03 PM] jvaler#0000
food industries


[29-May-24 08:04 PM] jvaler#0000
personally it's my KOM & COF source. i grow HER on demeter

maybe they use it for Hdyroponic Farms? Fertility doesnt matter then


[30-May-24 07:19 AM] jvaler#0000
seems like an odd location then, it's really far away


[30-May-24 07:47 AM] flor2081#0000

bc Tc is used in nuclear medicine


[30-May-24 10:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000

there should be boron in game and then B+SIO should make glass

[30-May-24 10:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well you would still need Sodalime eg NA

@evany. me and @sidepipe are discussing ways to help early-midgame players get their hands on their first WCB. we'd like to know what was your experience with schaitr like? specifically the wait time


[31-May-24 12:41 PM] evany.#0000
timely !

I requested may 14
he acknowledged may 14
he told me 9days
he said may 24 ready for pickup (10 days)

so fairly close


[31-May-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
oh wow okay, way quicker than i thought


[31-May-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
and faster than rise, given their current backlog...


[31-May-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[31-May-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
ty


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] evany.#0000
one thing i'd add for people in that position is get your SSC and LHP over to heph FIRST.


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] evany.#0000
you cannot fit the WCB parts + that in a single starter ship


[31-May-24 12:45 PM] evany.#0000
in my case i ended up having to bring a ship back to pick up the other parts to deliver them to shipyard and then i was able to upgrade


[31-May-24 12:45 PM] evany.#0000
so if there are others getting their first WCB - i'd encourage you to deliver the other parts first on your trip back from moria so your not waiting the extra ~16 hours


[31-May-24 12:52 PM] igfloz#0000
@evany.  what was the cost for parts  + ship build if you can give an indications of a goal wallet required


[31-May-24 12:54 PM] evany.#0000
he does deals for 650k for WCB kit

> Standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k) - these are the basic parts required to upgrade to a WCB-capable ship
> Enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k) - the added fuel tanks provide longer range for your ship

[31-May-24 12:57 PM] evany.#0000
the common advice and something i found form tinkering is to install an LHP for a 10% faster ship too.

so total components you will need to source by yourself: (these are the components you should pre-stage on heph too)
LHP 68
SSC 32

the components provided are the: (these are provided in his kit)
LFE 1
LFL 1
MSL 1
WCB 1

I've bought 14 upgrade kits from shaitr now to distribute to new KAWA members, super responsive and fast to deliver even though I requested some different parts


[31-May-24 01:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
note: shaitr's kits don't include LHP or SSC. if anyone here is upgrading starters I think that KAWA could supply those for cheap


[31-May-24 01:46 PM] jvaler#0000
ooh okay so they do allow pre-buying kits for mass distribution?


[31-May-24 01:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah, still a strict rule of one kit per player and within 180d though, so I keep a list for them to make sure nobody intentionally or accidentally double dips

[31-May-24 02:37 PM] jvaler#0000
so i *could* take the rise route and contract out the production to these new players, or the roganartu route and make a co-op, but i'd rather just not. nothing easier than just throwing money at a problem right? lmfao

I'm a little way from needing a ship upgrade, but I wondered why WCB rather than LCB? I'd have thought LCB would be more flexible.


[31-May-24 03:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
LCB is definitely more flexible, but the upgrade to WCB is cheaper. I think going to LCB requires a new crew quarters and a few other parts


[31-May-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah the best plan is WCB upgrades and new LCB ships


[31-May-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
imo


[31-May-24 03:59 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah, that rings a bell. There are some parts that change based upon the user selectable ones. I guess that makes it more expensive.


[31-May-24 04:01 PM] jvaler#0000
yup. LCB is 2,000m^3 as opposed to the 1,000m^3 WCB. that increase hits certain volume threshholds that require you to upgrade your crew quarters and quite a few FTL emitters

was also sad seeing them fighing the burnout just because they felt obligated. I've been cutting back a lot of responsibilities fighting a similar burnout so it was sad seeing that he'd just gone a little too far to pull back in time. So many AA projects and other things that just felt like obligations. My position in KAWAs production felt like that for a bit until I figured out a kind of 'compromise' to make my life easier without totally bailing out on the things I said I'd produce

now I just have simpler bases overproducing some simpler products. I sell the excess on CX and use the money to fund newer players bases to produce the things I used to or had committed to. I like the social side of the game a lot, so just simplifying the in-game stuff in exchange for more corp coordinating and helping is good for me

mostly. it's like 90% up to date but I'd need to rebalance a few things to account for recent changes.

this is my first shipping lane plan, but it's outdated. I have more bases and more ships now

I don't do anything fancy like that atm, just help you understand your flow rate between sectors and where it'd be good to build warehouses and maybe offload some of the shipments to contracts

I'm working on a discord bot that helps plan very profitable shipping lanes from contracts


[01-Jun-24 05:47 PM] lossi#0000
Which is, coincidentally of course, why I help people find where it might be efficient to drop some of their load in contracts instead of internal

[01-Jun-24 05:59 PM] jvaler#0000
and even if you are... sometimes it's still easier lol

i'll only send out a WCB to collect my C from nascent when i have 1k to fill the cargo, but i don't need a 1k buffer on any of my planets so it gets to sit at ANT


[01-Jun-24 06:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
I also do the ANT - everywhere routes üòÑ


[01-Jun-24 06:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
only exception is harmonia -> norwick and the SE-110 system, since I've got a little STL ship for that. I'll probably do more if I can find / make a tool that will tell me how much to load at ANT and how much to offload at a given stop


[01-Jun-24 06:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I forget that kind of information the instant I close Prun for the day


[01-Jun-24 06:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just have an irrational distaste for flying empty anywhere, so the to/from CX doesn't make me happy üòÜ Also, since KAWA mostly trades internally instead of using CX, most of the hubs where I buy things are actually just planets. So building on those planets and working them into a cohesive shipping pattern is just necessary to some degree with the ratio of bases to ships I have


[01-Jun-24 06:47 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just also find loading/unloading ships to be the most annoying and tedious part of the game... so I like setting up consistent routes so that at each stop I know "load a, b, and c, unload x, y, and z, go" and it's pretty thoughtless and efficient


[01-Jun-24 06:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
instead of "ok, I've got a ship at BEN now, where does it need to go? what does it need to take?"


[01-Jun-24 06:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That does have some benefits though, so I *am* currently moving towards more of a hybrid I think, that uses certain planets as hubs, then ships that just fly between hubs. So basically every trip will be to/from BEN, ANT, or Proxion ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[01-Jun-24 06:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
anyway, I'm done rambling now üòÖ


[01-Jun-24 06:55 PM] evany.#0000
It‚Äôs actually why I avoid non market to planet trips because if I stock two planets supplies onto one ship I need to figure out how much to send and then again how much to unload, then I get lazy don‚Äôt balance it and drop half only to find one base has 34 days and the other has 9


[01-Jun-24 06:56 PM] evany.#0000
Being able to trade goods without the contract system would be much better too, not sure why I can‚Äôt just open a trade window and dump it in if both players are online. Crazy

KAWA has a cluster of bases on JS-570a for processing tons of HAL, and Umbra for PG. Good stuff


[03-Jun-24 08:13 PM] jvaler#0000
nothing beats the quality of HAL on HALcyon, especially when produced by Hal98. you know this...


[03-Jun-24 08:14 PM] jvaler#0000
clearly KAWA needs more antares operations smh


[03-Jun-24 08:18 PM] jvaler#0000

[03-Jun-24 08:20 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeeeah, but it doesn't really take much HAL to provide for lots of EPO. And JS-570a also has LST for FLX. Brokkraf is also a KAWA planet kind of so that's cool

people always say that but it's not like it matters, right? you should be doing 13 FRMs anyways cause water is cheap


[03-Jun-24 08:24 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
idk it's pretty convenient to set up 12 FRM and a rig and produce more than enough H2O for the whole base...

you can always divide out the material prices to make sure they line up w/ what you'd expect


[10-Jun-24 06:53 PM] .shiva.#0000
they're certainly making less money now though. BSE/BBH are kinda running into the MM price a bit

@.shiva. @nyanism @igfloz @chobbycock @neeko.cat @akyantor 
okay i'm finally getting around to putting that order in, sorry for the delay. i'd like to confirm with you all your responses so i don't over/under-order.

so, to be clear, based off your response you would like to recieve 1-2 WCB upgrade kits by using a 0% interest no deadline ~900k AIC/ea loan provided by myself and sidepipe?

Yea me too, defo starting to get bottlenecked by my starter ships


[12-Jun-24 04:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
yep, still in. To clarify, the only thing we'd get directly is the normal WCB kit from Schaitr? We'd source the LHP/SSC ourselves right? (I already did so for LHP)


[12-Jun-24 04:09 PM] jvaler#0000
i've decided to source the LHP myself and then bundle it's price into the loan, that way it's easier on y'all. that's why it's ~900k, currently the source would be the CX but that can fluctuate. and if i find a cheaper alternative i will lower the loan accordingly

if you terminate the shipping contract the shipment should unpack, but i wouldn't do that until he has agreed to return it

we're not making them, we're buying them from schaitr. the project is purely financial, like how AGP is


[16-Jun-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
the order is already in and the batch size would make a count of 13 or 14 awkward. i feel like you'd be better served buying the kit from schaitr yourself? cause you'd be last in line in our already somewhat long queue


[16-Jun-24 12:13 PM] razesdark#0000
I read about it in the announcements after asking. Given the timeframe, I'dd probably either not require the loan as I would easilly be able to save up for the kit before then. 
I have no idea what the availabilities for the parts are usually like but I guess I'll start shopping around for parts.

don't quote me on this but i _believe_ jvalers plan was to supply people with access to the program to get 'easier' access to them, but also to keep a stockpile so people could buy them off of ADI directly if they weren't interested in the grant itself

by the time your big enough to need the upgrade your probably 2-3 bases and its hard to have the stocks on planets to maintain your planets with quite small buffers that your likely running due to it basically being a 2-3day trip each direction + moving stuff to heph (1 trip for wcb ocmponents, 2nd trip for ssc/lhp).


[16-Jun-24 07:19 PM] evany.#0000
at least it was for me, but i could just be bad. idk

üò¨ oops
that's a good idea, though given schaitr likes to keep track of the names of people who purchase kits i'm not sure that'll work
i should ask though


[16-Jun-24 08:38 PM] evany.#0000

i thought it was like 370 or so.


[16-Jun-24 08:39 PM] jvaler#0000
the idea was to "ease" the financial burden by making it 0 cost upfront via loans from us, and for us to also cover transportation of the kits in bulk


[16-Jun-24 08:39 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe not 6, but i've felt like our new membership rate has somewhat stagnated so i'm worried if we start something like that up it won't get used


[16-Jun-24 08:40 PM] tanda#0000
well we also haven't really been advertising

If we're going to be advertising, it'd be nice to have a project we'd be recruiting for. Maybe we finish INS and then try to get people in SE-110 to do something


[16-Jun-24 08:44 PM] tanda#0000
good luck on the homework!


[16-Jun-24 08:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

Nope

[16-Jun-24 08:49 PM] tanda#0000
well, that's fair considering the major rework coming up on that area


[16-Jun-24 08:53 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There's INS, then some sort of governing goods, then maybe something in SE-110 (I am not aware of what's really needed from food industries)


[16-Jun-24 08:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe Rfabs


[16-Jun-24 08:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't really see a reason to speculate the details that far ahead

Although those 2 permits of FPs might be worth splitting onto 1 on SE-110a and 1 on Norwick if you don‚Äôt have one there yet. But that can be a later step if you need a few more FPs

that must only be that high because of how expensive AL is right now

FP being almost as high on your graph as INC are is worrying though

AML has always been #1 on the chart for as long as I checked it, lol


[16-Jun-24 09:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It costs like 12 mil to build so not very viable


[16-Jun-24 09:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The FP is making DW btw


[16-Jun-24 09:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think it's because of the spike today

It would also be a pain in the ass to repair. Though if we get a bunch of people AML bases, Afabs will probably be more active on CX

[16-Jun-24 09:39 PM] jvaler#0000
that's true, 1 HYF base feeds many COF bases


[16-Jun-24 09:40 PM] jvaler#0000
but you could also reduce the overproduction by partly making HCP for INC to run higher input recipes

Is there an easy way to convert currency? Other than buying stuff at the associated CX and selling at another


[18-Jun-24 11:34 AM] chobbycock#0000
I have a massive amount of BBH I'm struggling to shift at a price where I'm making profit on it, but some of the other CX's there's a market, but I'd then be getting my profits in a different currency


[18-Jun-24 11:38 AM] tanda#0000
Take a look at the FX,  but if you're hauling out to sell, you should be hauling back to sell as well


[18-Jun-24 11:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
You can also buy EDC with the profits and haul them back to your CX to sell


[18-Jun-24 11:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
But if you do that, you may want to see if the difference in prices is a better deal than using the FX


[18-Jun-24 11:45 AM] chobbycock#0000
What is EDC?


[18-Jun-24 11:45 AM] chobbycock#0000

[18-Jun-24 11:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
MAT EDC üòâ


[18-Jun-24 11:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
They‚Äôre entertainment data cores - the market maker buy on them is really high (11,500) and they‚Äôre very lightweight, so it‚Äôs an efficient way to move currency around


[18-Jun-24 11:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think on most CXs people offer them for sale at a bit above the MM


[18-Jun-24 11:48 AM] chobbycock#0000
Ah ok, so they're basically an alternate way of exchanging currency?


[18-Jun-24 11:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
Not on purpose, but they‚Äôve become that


[18-Jun-24 11:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think Interstellar Gaia offers them on all CXs at 11600 - 11700, so you can use them to exchange currency at a 1% loss


[18-Jun-24 11:50 AM] chobbycock#0000
Ah ok, that's not too bad then


[18-Jun-24 11:51 AM] chobbycock#0000
Alright cool, I'll look into that, becasue having like 3.5 mil worth of BBH I can't shift is getting really annoying when I want to expand


[18-Jun-24 11:57 AM] igfloz#0000
@chobbycock  Have you considered offering any on the internal market ?


[18-Jun-24 11:58 AM] igfloz#0000
I doubt you will shift any large numbers, but it could be a revenue source


[18-Jun-24 12:00 PM] chobbycock#0000
I'm planning on do it for future stuff I make, however with this massive batch, I was still getting everything set up, plus I bought it when people were selling it for a significant discount to make profit, so I need to sell it quite high to break even, and theres already internal market prices that are too low for me to match with this batch I have


[18-Jun-24 12:01 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, starting up has been a bit of a challenge for me also


[18-Jun-24 12:06 PM] igfloz#0000

my spreadsheet doesn't seem to be cooperating for me to do full calculations, but we should only need an additional 136 LHP by at least like 7/3/24. maybe a few days after as shipping will take a minute

[19-Jun-24 09:46 AM] chobbycock#0000
Ah ok, I'll make sure I double check that then


[19-Jun-24 09:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
And be cautious if you‚Äôre arbitraging things that aren‚Äôt super liquid - you can end up with a bunch of money tied up in inventory that way.

I can supply mass MG and H

I got like 3500 MG chilling at ANT rn doing nothing ü´†

Only thing is I do all my operations on Heph and ZV-759g

We already got more MG than we need


[23-Jun-24 11:23 AM] tanda#0000
the PE manufacture base on Heph that is being stepped up is going to require a lot of H

i need H too

[23-Jun-24 06:44 PM] tanda#0000
by the way, since we don't need a full base of AR, and it's not really going to make you money, you should consider only running 20 RIG and then about 4 COL for H


[23-Jun-24 06:45 PM] tanda#0000
the H is much more valuable than the AR

I thought they were just gonna resell because I undercut y'all by a bit, but that doesnt make sense if he bought you out too

Happens a lot that Amp buys my afabs to flip them


[24-Jun-24 10:02 AM] jvaler#0000
only 2k spread isn't much of a resell anyways

if you do like a water or gas base you basically need a volume hauler eh?


[24-Jun-24 04:23 PM] jvaler#0000
water's actually best in an LCB, and so is a lot of gasses


[24-Jun-24 04:24 PM] jvaler#0000
it's only stuff like H that benefits from a VCB, making them incredibly niche

[24-Jun-24 09:05 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm shutting down all but one of my bases over the next month, so that part is fine. I just want to be able to govern still


[24-Jun-24 09:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
so maybe I'll just become a puppet master in the new system like Rise is in the current one. lol. I'll just coordinate everything and ask others to run üòÜ


[24-Jun-24 09:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
paying just to be able to govern seems not worth it


[24-Jun-24 09:06 PM] tanda#0000
honestly considering the sharp increase in people needed, I'm thinking about helping govern some of the less populated planets I'm on


[24-Jun-24 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
oh crap, MCG has gone up by like 6 per unit


[24-Jun-24 09:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
depends. might actually be *less* people needed now that you can run on multiple planets. KAWAs governing team will go from about 12 governors to a team of about 8 governing *more* planets


[24-Jun-24 09:45 PM] tanda#0000
that many people wanted out of it?


[24-Jun-24 09:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
some did, others just aren't interested in learning the new system. It definitely adds a lot of steps to something that used to be pretty simple for one person to manage. This system has some cool potential for groups like us, but definitely adds some complexity that will probably push many current governors out


[24-Jun-24 09:49 PM] jcheung#0000
what's involved with governing?


[24-Jun-24 09:49 PM] jcheung#0000
gist i got out of tutorial was you get taxes and then you pay for a bunch of stuff


[24-Jun-24 09:49 PM] jcheung#0000
and if you don't pay for it people get mad


[24-Jun-24 09:50 PM] jcheung#0000

managing population infrastructure to ensure that all bases on the planet have enough workers to fill all their buildings, then adjusting taxes to hopefully make enough to break even


[24-Jun-24 09:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it's... a lot. and totally unneccessary for 95% of players to even learn, lol. Some of us are weird and think it's fun though, despite being mostly thankless extra work üòÜ but that's kinda this whole game so...

[24-Jun-24 09:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, governing smaller planets can be really fun - they‚Äôre fairly cheap, and it can be a lot of fun to help meet the needs of a small but growing population (both workers and players)

[24-Jun-24 09:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
But jokes aside, governing smaller planets is a lot of fun. It‚Äôs a nice way to interact with players other than buying and selling stuff


[24-Jun-24 09:59 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Yeah. I'm curious to see how the changes will affect player interest in goving. Ultimately, I would be surprised if much changed, other than added complication of having wrangle more cats to do the same work and press more buttons to activate the same programs and taxes.


[24-Jun-24 10:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm worried that there already really isn't enough players to fill up the game and multiple gov positions means more players needed


[24-Jun-24 10:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think the parliaments will shrink if there‚Äôs not enough to fill them. So like if 3-4 people run on a 5 MP planet, only 3 will end up in parliament


[24-Jun-24 10:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I mean, I dont really worry about that too much. The fact I can now directly control the majority of the planets I already govern through proxies is a big plus


[24-Jun-24 10:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
The only downside is, for the larger planets, getting other folks who dont mind the daily/weekly clicks to do it along with me


[24-Jun-24 10:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Providing the upkeep is the easiest part (only because im established and have dedicated production)


[24-Jun-24 10:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000

The ideal was democracy but the end result will likely be one governor and a majority of rubber stamps üòÑ

Democracy is the worst form of government... except for all the others


[24-Jun-24 10:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And, like in real life, most voters tend not to care about the day to day. They dont want to think about it, they dont want to be involved, they just want it to "happen"


[24-Jun-24 10:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000
at least in PrUn, there are clear success/failure metrics that one can objectively say, "This is good", or the opposite


[24-Jun-24 10:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well @riseoffilth if you don‚Äôt know what to do with your money. You could idk maybe give me a ship ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[24-Jun-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
how much do ships cost to build/upgrade?


[24-Jun-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
not that i can afford it


[24-Jun-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
...or have the ability to get them


[24-Jun-24 10:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can get a starter ship upgrade kit for 650k


[24-Jun-24 10:42 PM] jcheung#0000
what does that include?


[24-Jun-24 10:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
WCB LSL MFL

late game permits cost tens of millions of credits, whereas early game permits are pocket change


[24-Jun-24 11:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
This is also true


[24-Jun-24 11:07 PM] jvaler#0000
so it's more efficient to prop up less established players than dump that money into more personal HQ upgrades

[25-Jun-24 06:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Message length limit usually isn't an issue


[25-Jun-24 06:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Also it's been there for as long as i remember. 
There's reasons for it. Remember that every single message that you've sent is saved


[25-Jun-24 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
And 2,000 characters (i swear it used to be 1,500) is enough for normal use unless you're...
- arguing with someone
- writing a list
- writing a story
- going over code (which if long enough messages auto convert to text fole)

at least if you have the tile wide enough so the lines don't wrap

yup. all the typos I ever made in planet chat are preserved for all time üòÑ

some channels aren't in that server, but you can still access them on the FIO site


[27-Jun-24 09:18 PM] jvaler#0000
it has the same chat log feature

[28-Jun-24 10:43 AM] jcheung#0000
this trip had apparently 3 paths to take, dropped half the travel time while i was fiddling with it


[28-Jun-24 10:44 AM] jcheung#0000
and used less fuel to boot


[28-Jun-24 10:44 AM] jcheung#0000
...i wish it didn't have such a wide split


[28-Jun-24 11:29 AM] jvaler#0000
3?


[28-Jun-24 11:29 AM] jvaler#0000
i've never seen that before lol


[28-Jun-24 11:31 AM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. The first one was 11 hrs ANT to Deimos
Second was 7.5 hrs
Third was 5 hrs that i got while i was deciding what time i wanted it to come in at, and then lost it... took like 50 clicks to get it again


[28-Jun-24 11:32 AM] jvaler#0000
hmmm


[28-Jun-24 12:03 PM] evany.#0000
yeah its really weird what it chooses


[28-Jun-24 12:03 PM] evany.#0000
i get that with deimos all the time. its between 2-7 hours


[28-Jun-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
you've also gotten 3 different calculations before?


[28-Jun-24 02:02 PM] evany.#0000
many times


[28-Jun-24 02:02 PM] evany.#0000
usually ones around 2 hours which ican find about 30% of the time
then 4 hours probably 50% of the time


[28-Jun-24 02:03 PM] evany.#0000
the remainder im just trying to goto bed and its like 6h53m and im just like fuck it go i dont care goodnight ship and i hit send

is there a way to join a planet chat without being a site owner?


[28-Jun-24 02:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No?


[28-Jun-24 02:17 PM] jcheung#0000
ah well


[28-Jun-24 02:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
At least I don‚Äôt know of any method


[28-Jun-24 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000
i meant on the same flight at the same time


[28-Jun-24 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000
cause i've never seen 3 different calculations for the same flight, only 2


[28-Jun-24 03:47 PM] jvaler#0000
ingame? no


[28-Jun-24 03:47 PM] jvaler#0000
but you can view any of them on the FIO website, or that discord only if it's been manually added


[28-Jun-24 04:19 PM] evany.#0000
i dont pay that much attention but i'm pretty sure there is no rotations its noe like places are orbiting or something i dont think ? no solar system 
i routinely find 2 4 and 7 hour trips between ant and deimos which is a wild variance


[28-Jun-24 04:19 PM] jvaler#0000
that's cause of deimos' orbit


[28-Jun-24 04:20 PM] jvaler#0000
so the answer is that you haven't seen 3 different calculations on the same flight?


[28-Jun-24 04:48 PM] nyanism#0000
there is actually rotation

[28-Jun-24 05:07 PM] .shiva.#0000
note the trails


[28-Jun-24 05:07 PM] .shiva.#0000
also means planets closer to the sun have much lower variance in flight time


[28-Jun-24 05:37 PM] jcheung#0000
bleh. didn't realize that if i didn't accept the faction contracts they don't send new ones üò¶


[28-Jun-24 05:47 PM] igfloz#0000
They will in a day or so - the old ones just get cancelled


[28-Jun-24 05:48 PM] jcheung#0000
this one was aged "3 days" and when i canceled it it instantly gave me a new set


[28-Jun-24 05:49 PM] igfloz#0000
hmm, had you accepted it ? I think mine change every 2 , maybe 3 days


[28-Jun-24 05:49 PM] igfloz#0000
...however, I mostly ignore them, and I get new ones regularly


[28-Jun-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
no, but i had rejected two of the three


[28-Jun-24 05:56 PM] igfloz#0000
You only have to accept one. The other 2 will auto cancel. No need to reject specific faction contracts


[28-Jun-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
i was undecided on if i wanted to take the third


[28-Jun-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000

i have a dumb question


[30-Jun-24 06:50 PM] jcheung#0000
the system that has harmonia in it, is there any reason why one of the other worlds wasn't built up to have food industries cogc?


[30-Jun-24 06:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Most people make GRN to make C on Harmonia? Not sure just supposition


[30-Jun-24 06:51 PM] jcheung#0000
hmm.


[30-Jun-24 06:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also those planets could just suck?


[30-Jun-24 06:52 PM] jcheung#0000
i mean, they do, but unless i'm sorely mistaken, which i could be, it looks like 'life' was set up as a hydroponics world

well that's what norwick is for. afaik the rest of the planets in harmonia's system have at least 1 red environmental condition making them more expensive to build on


[30-Jun-24 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000
but norwick is a triple green so it's cheaper to build there


[30-Jun-24 07:35 PM] jcheung#0000

Should we have a separate shipping channel? I don't know how it goes for late-game players, but in the early game, I sure fly empty a lot of times and can offer shipping opportunities here and there


[01-Jul-24 11:11 AM] evany.#0000

i'd be down for that

i'll make a channel for that


[01-Jul-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
okay it's made
is the bot message okay? or is the "time-sensitive" too restricting?


[01-Jul-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
i just feel like any recurring shipping offers will get drowned out so it's not worth bothering with


[01-Jul-24 11:44 AM] razenpok#0000
Maybe put "one-off" in the message instead?


[01-Jul-24 11:44 AM] razenpok#0000
And yea, recurring offers will get drowned out


[01-Jul-24 11:46 AM] jvaler#0000

Maybe things will calm down once my initial fill of these places are done


[02-Jul-24 08:17 PM] jcheung#0000
Especially once i get over my desire to not use up a ton of fuel per trip >.>

thankfully during the week I just chill and route my ships around my wakeup and home arrival times


[02-Jul-24 08:18 PM] tanda#0000
during the weekend is when I get tempted to accelerate


[02-Jul-24 08:18 PM] tanda#0000
my fuel depots are actually pretty close to exhausted


[02-Jul-24 08:19 PM] jcheung#0000
It's annoying when an extra 100 fuel gets you only like half an hour off


[02-Jul-24 08:21 PM] jcheung#0000
I know it's only 1.5k but that's not exactly little to me üòÇ


[02-Jul-24 08:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So don‚Äôt use the extra 100 fuel


[02-Jul-24 08:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Either that or ship sits idle for 10 hrs

you could do a funny goofy and be the first to re-colonize apothecary ever since last universe


[02-Jul-24 08:59 PM] jvaler#0000
but IY-028b is probably the more reasonable pick


[02-Jul-24 09:00 PM] jvaler#0000
~~well that or KI-439b, but it's kinda far for resource extraction~~ nvm that's metallurgy CoGC


[02-Jul-24 09:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or there is one with HAL and Chem CoGC

[02-Jul-24 09:02 PM] jvaler#0000

I so far don't *dislike* the game. As for liking it, i believe I've been told my brain is broke and i don't know how to like things. Too late for a refund


[02-Jul-24 09:10 PM] avalock#0000

[02-Jul-24 09:11 PM] jvaler#0000
i've seen at least 2 (maybe 3? i forgor) PRO sales in my time playing. a year might be too much when you could get a ~~20%~~ 15% discount later

I need to do some maintenance on my #internal-offers post


[02-Jul-24 09:37 PM] tanda#0000
give me a sec, I'll get a price


[02-Jul-24 09:38 PM] avalock#0000
sounds good


[02-Jul-24 09:38 PM] avalock#0000
i gotta find how much i need


[02-Jul-24 09:39 PM] avalock#0000
3,900


[02-Jul-24 09:39 PM] tanda#0000
looks like a good internal point after the price breaks in kevin I should be able to offer it at 110 internally


[02-Jul-24 09:39 PM] tanda#0000
man, I just saw the buy orders, if we're targeting 115 on the ANT market we have a huge task ahead of us


[02-Jul-24 09:40 PM] avalock#0000
i have the 429k rn so whenever i can drop by i‚Äôll do that


[02-Jul-24 09:41 PM] avalock#0000
cause 3900 @ 110 = 429k


[02-Jul-24 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
okay, no rush. I've only had time to make 1.8k


[02-Jul-24 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
probably around 36-40 hours


[02-Jul-24 09:42 PM] avalock#0000

What's a fuel planet in ANT ? Don't really know them


[05-Jul-24 09:05 PM] tanda#0000
looks like we only have two options: ZV-759e and LS-746b

[05-Jul-24 09:06 PM] tanda#0000
neither is great for fuel refining resources, but LS-746b is cheap to set up on and ZV-759e is close to the CX


[05-Jul-24 09:07 PM] tanda#0000
@puncher23  it's a bit more advanced, and a bit more expensive, but I just moved my PP2's and LST consumption next door to ZV-194b from Nike (but only because I needed Nike for #kevin-operations

[05-Jul-24 09:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@puncher23 We also have a slot for a PE producing base if you are interested


[05-Jul-24 09:08 PM] helminsted#0000
so then! when is a good time to start the moving? realistically i'll keep my current base in Katoa but move my HQ and center attention to Antaries space


[05-Jul-24 09:09 PM] avalock#0000
@histidinedwarf btw do you like my bars ü§£ I built the top one myself


[05-Jul-24 09:10 PM] tanda#0000
how's your logistics just supporting Katoa? can you manage with one ship?


[05-Jul-24 09:10 PM] helminsted#0000
yes i can and usually only use one ship for most traffic


[05-Jul-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
then I would say pick a planet, prep it out for around 750k cost in PRUN planner, and send a ship towards the ANT CX


[05-Jul-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
put in for your grant, and you should be approved and ready to start shopping by the time the ship gets here


[05-Jul-24 09:12 PM] helminsted#0000
sounds awesome =]


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Neat sliding stats but bars on each side are not my style. Reminded me that I wanted to try a vertical bar


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] avalock#0000
I like top bar from kali, might try just the top bar


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also, didn't know you can modify the corner of the window like that


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] avalock#0000
which corner?


[05-Jul-24 09:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The trans flag over the top right of firefox


[05-Jul-24 09:14 PM] avalock#0000
OH yeah thats just a firefox theme


[05-Jul-24 09:14 PM] avalock#0000

[05-Jul-24 09:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
About the grant, we have very little criteria for it besides actually being in Antares. We have some members with heavy pockets desperate to lighten the burden


[05-Jul-24 09:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
:)


[05-Jul-24 09:16 PM] puncher23#0000
The grant though does require you to build a base on a certain planet with a certain setup producing certain items or am i just misreading things.


[05-Jul-24 09:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
With the grant you can do whatever


[05-Jul-24 09:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The loan is for a specific base


[05-Jul-24 09:17 PM] tanda#0000
Keen, there's about 3 different financial incentives going right now


[05-Jul-24 09:17 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok I had no idea a loan was even an offering üôÇ


[05-Jul-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
one is strings free 750k grant from ADI. It just needs to be used in Antares space


[05-Jul-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
for kevin, there's a separate grant and a loan that are available


[05-Jul-24 09:19 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok I gotcha loan is for base making and assisting with projects roger


[05-Jul-24 09:19 PM] puncher23#0000
I think i got confused lol


[05-Jul-24 09:19 PM] tanda#0000
it is rather a lot, and some of these projects are new


[05-Jul-24 09:19 PM] puncher23#0000
Change my name to keenfused..


[05-Jul-24 09:20 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok so to get the grant i just need to dock at Antares space station if I read this correctly


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
not even that. Honestly start planning out how to spend it, post a request down in #agp-operations telling us what you want to do with it, and someone should fulfill it soon


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
money can be transferred through contracts without any ship movement.


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok do i need to show  a Prun snip of the plan or just verbal explain it.


[05-Jul-24 09:22 PM] tanda#0000
you WILL need a ship docked to take advantage of the #internal-offers


[05-Jul-24 09:22 PM] tanda#0000
you can do either one


[05-Jul-24 09:22 PM] helminsted#0000
can we take both grants with the promise of fulfilling both requirements and etc? because i'd love to make an absolute wave of progress for the projects you all had in mind =] i ask with innocent respect and genuine willingness to contribute to the projects of stuff


[05-Jul-24 09:23 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok i have a ship docking in about 3.5 hours  coming in from Ben


[05-Jul-24 09:23 PM] helminsted#0000
i'm in it for the awesome stuff i get to be a part of, not here for pocketing extra funds for myself


[05-Jul-24 09:23 PM] tanda#0000
I don't see why not. You would just need to let us know which base you planned on fulfilling if you wanted to help with kevin


[05-Jul-24 09:24 PM] helminsted#0000
awesome =] let's do it


[05-Jul-24 09:25 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok i put in the request to AGP ill let you all know when the ship slides into first base and cannot thank you enough for the boost it will be a massive game changer.


[05-Jul-24 09:26 PM] helminsted#0000
yeah this is so cool to be a part of xD just when i thought the single player life would be nice, teaming up is so much better

[05-Jul-24 09:42 PM] jcheung#0000
well you don't have to screen share


[05-Jul-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000
you need to be in voice to screen share


[05-Jul-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000

[05-Jul-24 09:53 PM] puncher23#0000
what i have so far 3 hab a pp1 a pp2 mk2 im assuming and an extractor


[05-Jul-24 09:53 PM] jcheung#0000
i don't know if you want to mix PP1 and PP2, let me double check


[05-Jul-24 09:54 PM] puncher23#0000
The extractor is getting limestone which with silicon makes MSG which is for buildings  so kind of made sense to make it


[05-Jul-24 09:54 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so pp2 can do anything a pp1 can, with a different recipe.
since you don't have a nearby source of iron production, it's going to be easier to ship AL than FE for the most part


[05-Jul-24 09:54 PM] puncher23#0000
I want to not only make B  blocks but the L blocks so was told to have a mk2 by my guys  so i could build more items


[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] riseoffilth#0000
the only thing PP1 is good for is BDE


[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] riseoffilth#0000
everything else is more expensive

[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] puncher23#0000
I am mining AL on Deimos and have a smelter in place and the planets are close so i can move it


[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] jcheung#0000
i thought so


[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] puncher23#0000
Yeah i import Iron from Ben when peeps come over.


[05-Jul-24 09:55 PM] riseoffilth#0000
(though if you have better access to FE over AL, it might be better)


[05-Jul-24 09:56 PM] puncher23#0000
Yes i have access to Fe from corp


[05-Jul-24 09:56 PM] puncher23#0000
Mind you once the aluminium kicks off I wont need FE but that takes time:)


[05-Jul-24 09:57 PM] puncher23#0000
But since I am going to not just be stopping at 2 bases if i need B mats later be nice to have.


[05-Jul-24 09:58 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok so for now lets go with this idea now i need to sort out cost and not sure where to add core onto this build


[05-Jul-24 09:59 PM] puncher23#0000
I think i need to link a cx for prices?

I'm sorry daddy


[06-Jul-24 08:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Fun fact to everyone here. 

If you produce PE on a planet with 20 credits tax on Pios, that tax will charge you approx $5.4 credits per PE job, that produces 200 PE, worth $1800. That is 0.23% effective tax rate on your production valve.

If you make EDC, with a build time at 100% of one day, sale value of 11500, you get taxed less than 200 credits(assuming a tax rate of 600 for engineers), for an effective tax rate of 1.5%.

you can still affect CX prices

like for example, there's a project currently to lower the price of INS a few credits


[11-Jul-24 01:08 AM] jcheung#0000
theoretically you could produce it too. you just won't have discounted feedstock and it would be harder to coordinate the grant to help build the bases

well point of interest ordering in any location field is sorted now, but that makes antares station like 6th in the list when typing "ant"
luckily "sta" can be used in the meantime to maintain the "sta" -> down arrow -> enter workflow

[11-Jul-24 09:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
I wonder if the autofill thing was pretty straightforward since the LM basically creates a contract anyway


[11-Jul-24 09:22 AM] jvaler#0000

[13-Jul-24 06:32 PM] jcheung#0000
get every warehouse i possibly can up to lvl 3 everywhere in antares space


[13-Jul-24 06:32 PM] jcheung#0000
to include totally uninhabited worlds

that would be an interesting mechanic for governments: Seizing the warehouse contents from deleted accounts and selling them off by lots


[13-Jul-24 06:49 PM] evany.#0000

well the credits have to go somewhere, right?


[13-Jul-24 06:49 PM] evany.#0000
this player was coliq'd in / deleted
72hours aftewards auctions all their shit


[13-Jul-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
or randomize it so one timezone doesn't get it


[13-Jul-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
the auction starts between 72 and 96 hours after the user is deleted for each warehouse / base they owned not all simultaneously


[13-Jul-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
totally randomly


[13-Jul-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
15 minutes bidding war and top bid gets it and the money gets deleted/given to npc


[13-Jul-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
not a bad idea at all


[13-Jul-24 06:53 PM] acramernc#0000
the gov owns the warehouse, it would make sense for the money to go to the gov


[13-Jul-24 06:54 PM] igfloz#0000
wait.... as player storage + WH storage appears to stack, when a player leaves do the Gov get both WH and STO contents ?


[13-Jul-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
I would say no, technically the players storage is not in a building owned by the government


[13-Jul-24 07:27 PM] evany.#0000
naw money in a game like this needs to get deleted otherwise we will get rampant inflation eventually.


[13-Jul-24 07:27 PM] evany.#0000
we need sinks!


[13-Jul-24 07:28 PM] evany.#0000
the basic consumables and such might be enough really (not enough information to say one way or another)


[13-Jul-24 07:30 PM] acramernc#0000
repairs and consumables are a sink


[13-Jul-24 07:30 PM] evany.#0000
lots of sinks lots of faucets


[15-Jul-24 09:56 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
It sounds like the devs are focusing on infrastructure. My expectation of when gateways will be here changed from 10 years to only 2 years !


[15-Jul-24 09:58 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I thought gateways would be a per-system type thing but per-planet are cool too. And they're adding more fuel :)


[15-Jul-24 10:05 AM] acramernc#0000
hmm, will be interesting to see the specifics of how those get implemented, seems like they could easily become quite a mess

[15-Jul-24 10:07 AM] acramernc#0000
I imagine they are going to have to make some pretty serious upgrades to their navigation algorithm


[15-Jul-24 10:19 AM] realharvey#0000
There are a lot of cool infrastructure ideas which have different levels of complexity. Being able to Build other Commodity exchanges (for Organisations for example) would also make a very interesting one. But like the navigation one they are aiming for its very complex and requires some things to be redone. (assumption)


[15-Jul-24 10:21 AM] realharvey#0000
For the Beginning of the infrastructure phase I would have loved to see a more simple object that we can build that is easier to implement


[15-Jul-24 10:21 AM] realharvey#0000
to get the required systems going and being able to iterate on that


[15-Jul-24 10:21 AM] realharvey#0000
A more simple thing would have been an Planetary Elevator for example which would remove the need to land on a planet


[15-Jul-24 10:22 AM] realharvey#0000
once build you only need to be in orbit to access your base storage


[15-Jul-24 10:23 AM] realharvey#0000
it's less fancy, but in my opinion a great starting point to test how Infrastructure works and can be handled


[15-Jul-24 10:27 AM] acramernc#0000
i really would like them to have worked on private exchanges or better contracts first, but such is life lol

{Reactions}
üëç 

[15-Jul-24 10:33 AM] realharvey#0000
I do believe private exchanges is even more difficult


[15-Jul-24 10:35 AM] acramernc#0000
idk, i think they could be pretty simple


[15-Jul-24 10:37 AM] acramernc#0000
creating them would be no more complicated than the gateways, except I imagine they would be done through the corporation


[15-Jul-24 10:38 AM] acramernc#0000
and then they are just another destination, or more likely another screen attached to an already existing location


[15-Jul-24 11:00 AM] jcheung#0000
I mean a private exchange could be a corp project and just be a warehouse with extra steps


[15-Jul-24 11:18 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't love the idea of private CXs, especially as the first infrastructure project. I see how it can be used for outer rim planets but I suspect it would mostly be used for in-corp trading and it'd spread the market even thinner


[15-Jul-24 11:20 AM] acramernc#0000
i don't think it would drive any additional in corp trading, it would just move trading from places like #internal-offers  into the native game


[15-Jul-24 11:21 AM] acramernc#0000
might even decrease the amount of in-corp trading since you probably wouldn't be able to list the same products on multiple private cx


[15-Jul-24 11:23 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
wdym ?


[15-Jul-24 11:27 AM] acramernc#0000
lets say i have 10k PG and i'm a member of KAWA and this server, if i go and list that PG on the ADI cx, it won't be available on the KAWA CX, wheras as it is right now I would probably have listings in both servers


[15-Jul-24 11:27 AM] acramernc#0000
assuming both cx have escrow setup / enabled


[15-Jul-24 11:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
ah yeah, good point. if it takes the goods out when you list it, you can't offer them multiple places


[15-Jul-24 11:29 AM] evany.#0000
the only way you'd be able to offer them at both would be if you started to get into private access lists to groups of players / corporations 
i.e list on a private cx
that private cx has permissions for both adi and kawa residents to use


[15-Jul-24 11:29 AM] evany.#0000
access lists like that the players are probably "upto" the challenge, but from what i've seen of the development team not so much..


[15-Jul-24 11:29 AM] acramernc#0000
could also be worked around by selling into bids


[15-Jul-24 11:30 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
You still have one stock of PG. I don't get how it makes a difference. Either way you still have access to contracts and private CXs are an alternative, there being another alternative to contracts physically can't make in-corp trading any harder


[15-Jul-24 11:31 AM] evany.#0000
i think his point was that you'd have to tear down the order from t he private cx


[15-Jul-24 11:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
which makes it no easier than the current system, just replace the CX


[15-Jul-24 11:32 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
What is the audience for a private CX in your mind ? @acramernc


[15-Jul-24 11:32 AM] .urpalhal#0000
OOG has an auction discord bot


[15-Jul-24 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Private CXs are not what this game needs at all.


[15-Jul-24 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
There's so many infinitely more important and beneficial things they could do infrastructure wise than private CXs.


[15-Jul-24 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, if there were way more players, maybe. But then you just end up with people flocking to the cheapest corp market and utilising that instead, in reality just moving the problem elsewhere.


[15-Jul-24 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
My first thought for some form of major infrastructure would have to be either some form of better transportation across stars or between stars, or space elevators.


[15-Jul-24 11:40 AM] acramernc#0000
I think it would just streamline the frankly obtuse system we are stuck with rn of searching a discord channel for a listing and then making a custom contract


[15-Jul-24 11:41 AM] acramernc#0000
if i could just throw a bid up for 1k RAT whenever i get low instead of having to watch sidepipes stock levels it would make my life much easier (no shade to sidepipe, he has the tastiest RATs)


[15-Jul-24 11:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I go back and forth. on the one hand, in-corp trading is a thing and it's not going away, so I'd love for that to be easier. on the other hand, further subdividing the market isn't great for those who don't have the option of in-corp trading


[15-Jul-24 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Really in corp trading isn't something that should be encouraged.

I mean it works well for those involved, sure, but it does hurt the entirely of the game in a complete sense.


[15-Jul-24 11:45 AM] evany.#0000
if i had a wish list with the game most of it would probably be simple things..

with ships let me choose route paths rather then guessing and arbitrarily selecting fuel choices to hope to get 'good path'
give me a consumables hold on ships and allow me to give ships/crew consumables and allow me to setup queues
i.e go here, pick up this, deliver it here, fulfill this contract then pick up this and go here.. give it some arbitrary limit e.g 24hours so i don't have to alarm clock
fix contracts, how is it easier to use the market then it is contracts. 
ui issues-- why do i have to type something then wait for a context/dropdown box then choose the thing in the dropdown box only now i can hit the send or confirm button?
allow me to pre-set inventory levels i.e base ABC should have 100 of these, 50 of those and 90 of this.. let me hit a fill ABC button on my ship from CX rather than me referencing (likely something out of game, or PMMG) something else just to sanely fill containers?

those would be my 5 personally..


[15-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm 50/50 on whether this would actually reduce the need for searching


[15-Jul-24 11:45 AM] evany.#0000
i'd be curious to see what other peoples "five" would be


[15-Jul-24 11:46 AM] acramernc#0000
i mean, if they gave us a proper api and let that api create contracts then we could design external tools that would do all of this for us


[15-Jul-24 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would imagine that'd go against automation.


[15-Jul-24 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's unlikely to change.


[15-Jul-24 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
its likely only reason we have api is for web/steamclient sync to begin with


[15-Jul-24 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
And automation should definitely not be in the game imo.


[15-Jul-24 11:48 AM] acramernc#0000
all i'm suggesting is that the api would allow you to create contracts, not accept or execute on them


[15-Jul-24 11:49 AM] acramernc#0000
the only thing automated there is filling out a form


[15-Jul-24 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
i actually specifically asked molp about something like that recently


[15-Jul-24 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
although made on my end, not as part of the game... was told that as long as it doesn't generate traffic, it's fine


[15-Jul-24 11:51 AM] acramernc#0000
yeah the devs current policy is "no tool is allowed to initiate a call to the server"


[15-Jul-24 11:54 AM] razenpok#0000
1. Repeat contract button in CONTD
2. Open buffer-as-tooltip when hovering over things that open new buffer (e.g. hover over RAT, a MAT RAT tooltip shows above the cursor)
3. Close all floating buffers button
4. 2-3 choices available as "Last used locations" in contract creation buffer
5. User connectivity status in COMS, or anywhere else where you can see a username


[15-Jul-24 11:54 AM] evany.#0000
#5 like a friends list ?


[15-Jul-24 11:55 AM] razenpok#0000
Nope, it's like a red/green dot near a username in COMS


[15-Jul-24 11:55 AM] razenpok#0000
Like, "This user is online"


[15-Jul-24 11:55 AM] razenpok#0000

I think actually making the recurring button on contracts do something would be about as much in-corp trading support I'd like.

I tried it first because I heard a very cool story. There's a Russian youtuber that reviews MMO stories from stuff like Eve and one of them was about screeps. Player A captured a base of player B. B wrote the AI so that bases missing energy get resupplied by bases nearby. A took advantage and accepted the energy then dumped it on the ground. B's AI drained every base trying to supply the captured base


[15-Jul-24 12:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I wish it was a bit more gradual with automation, kind of how factorio is gradual with automation, where you start by manually doing stuff and then make more and more automated systems. I felt I had to have a whole system built to just start

[17-Jul-24 08:50 AM] jvaler#0000
debilitating is a bit far... but it's more like depression i think. i mean it basically is right?


[17-Jul-24 08:51 AM] avalock#0000
ohh yeah i just thought like‚Ä¶ not having the uhhhh motivation to do anything


[17-Jul-24 08:52 AM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah


[17-Jul-24 08:52 AM] jvaler#0000

[23-Jul-24 01:07 AM] razenpok#0000
I'll probably do bhp->lhp replacement on my 500/500 starter. Same 150k, but more straightforward benefit

Gateways seem to be coming along much quicker than I had anticipated.


[23-Jul-24 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Definitely something I'd like to see more of.


[25-Jul-24 03:36 PM] xtc69#0000
when you deconstruct do you get full mats ?


[25-Jul-24 03:37 PM] jvaler#0000
within a certain timeframe yes, but over time you'll get less back due to building degradation


[25-Jul-24 03:37 PM] jvaler#0000
you would have had to repair that degradation anyways though so it's not necessarily less efficient to deconstruct things
(except for habitats and storages, those don't ever need to be repaired so try not to deconstruct those if you don't need to)


[25-Jul-24 03:37 PM] jcheung#0000
i think it's 2 hrs?


[25-Jul-24 03:38 PM] jcheung#0000
....1 hr for sure


[25-Jul-24 03:38 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought it was like 24hrs lol


[25-Jul-24 03:38 PM] jvaler#0000
idk


[25-Jul-24 03:38 PM] jcheung#0000
off to read the tutorials


[25-Jul-24 03:38 PM] jvaler#0000
i doubt that's listed info but maybe


[25-Jul-24 03:39 PM] jcheung#0000
i know i read it somewhere


[25-Jul-24 03:40 PM] xtc69#0000

[25-Jul-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
oop


[25-Jul-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
okay i'm pretty sure that's already at maximum degradation so you'll get nothing back, right?


[25-Jul-24 03:40 PM] xtc69#0000
haha been a min since i have played so going to be behind on some things


[25-Jul-24 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000
yech. that's a lot of degredation üòÇ


[25-Jul-24 03:41 PM] jvaler#0000
so that building is technically running at 0 degradation cost, but it's also a super inefficient use of your consumables


[25-Jul-24 03:41 PM] jvaler#0000
and consumables cost much more than degradation


[25-Jul-24 03:41 PM] jvaler#0000
so i'd say either repair or deconstruct it


[25-Jul-24 03:42 PM] xtc69#0000
going to deconstruct it


[25-Jul-24 03:42 PM] xtc69#0000

might be better to just restart isnt lol


[25-Jul-24 03:44 PM] jvaler#0000
yeaah i'd restart tbh. you haven't generated enough profit for repairing everything to be worth it. you'll have more stuff by just COLIQing


[25-Jul-24 03:46 PM] xtc69#0000
going to have to finish the contracts first


[25-Jul-24 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000
if you've got PRO you could be eligible for AGP to give you 750k AIC for free too


[25-Jul-24 03:46 PM] xtc69#0000
yeah still be worth restarting to though right


[25-Jul-24 03:47 PM] xtc69#0000
even if i do get that


[25-Jul-24 03:47 PM] jvaler#0000

at the moment i'd say it's pretty good yeah


[25-Jul-24 03:52 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm not sure what the best necessarily is atm, but AL SME on deimos isn't the shitshow it was a few months ago anymore. (C prices had skyrocketed and AL prices hadn't increased yet to match)


[25-Jul-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
just remember to use the FLX recipe


[25-Jul-24 03:54 PM] igfloz#0000
...plus there are older players that are looking to settle on Deimos (that can't right now- planet full) ....Deimos as a starter is pretty good with what I have learned so far


[25-Jul-24 03:55 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i think you'll be glad to have deimos under your belt if you ever choose to go into construction later on. basically everything within that requires AL

[25-Jul-24 06:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, that looks like a good start. You are extracting a lot more ore than you are using, so you will have access to sell. Your net profit will probably be higher if you build more SMEs than EXTs.

three was a full week of no sales


[25-Jul-24 06:38 PM] jcheung#0000
AU is best refined where it's used because refining it adds a shitload of mass


[25-Jul-24 06:38 PM] jcheung#0000
From my understanding


[25-Jul-24 06:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah from 11.58t to 38.64t


[25-Jul-24 06:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would say refine gold only if you have specific buyer


[25-Jul-24 06:40 PM] marat_sh#0000

spliting same order in two doesn't do anything


[25-Jul-24 06:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
3 / 3 spit is same as 3


[25-Jul-24 06:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
3 orders would use 50% of the day and other 3 orders would use other 50%. It's same as one 3 orders use 100% of the day


[25-Jul-24 06:49 PM] xtc69#0000
aww k


[25-Jul-24 06:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
3 of 50% + 3 of 50% = 3 of 100%


[25-Jul-24 06:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
since it's a Metallurgy planet I would swap for more SME


[25-Jul-24 06:51 PM] xtc69#0000
so max SME going to cost roughly 1m for everything so going to have to split that in half for grant right

was thinking of doing just half of that size first


[25-Jul-24 06:53 PM] xtc69#0000
to get money rolling first


[25-Jul-24 06:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
Sounds good on paper


[25-Jul-24 06:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
Some times if you wouldn't have sales for Al


[25-Jul-24 06:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can split some of your smelting for Ti


[25-Jul-24 06:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
and just buy ore

[25-Jul-24 06:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
something like this


[25-Jul-24 06:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
for each 2 orders of AL you would have 1 order of Ti


[25-Jul-24 06:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
Ti would be better for ROI if you can reliably sell it


[25-Jul-24 07:01 PM] xtc69#0000
yea if the demand was there


[25-Jul-24 07:01 PM] xtc69#0000
starting to understand for sure


[25-Jul-24 07:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
I mean Ti is selling better then AU for sure but not in the same volumes as Al

looking at 10k daily cost for food just making sure that is right wish i could add fuel on each trip roughly


[25-Jul-24 09:37 PM] jcheung#0000
have too much housing


[25-Jul-24 09:38 PM] jcheung#0000
i would personally try to squeeze in some more EXTs, but that's up to you


[25-Jul-24 09:38 PM] jcheung#0000
use "optimize" by the housing


[25-Jul-24 09:38 PM] tanda#0000
squeeze in the EXTs, if you have excess, I can buy all of it at market rates


[25-Jul-24 09:38 PM] jcheung#0000
i would also put in some STOs


[25-Jul-24 09:38 PM] tanda#0000
I would recommend two, personally


[25-Jul-24 09:39 PM] jcheung#0000
that said if you're set on having exactly this design, remove 2 HB1's and that should (i think) also reduce your 10k workforce cost a little?


[25-Jul-24 09:40 PM] tanda#0000
you only pay (or employ) the pops you have both housing and jobs for


[25-Jul-24 09:40 PM] jcheung#0000
just checked via prunplanner


[25-Jul-24 09:40 PM] jcheung#0000
you pay upkeep on housing, not employed


[25-Jul-24 09:40 PM] tanda#0000
so that's just an extra 200 room. You could definitely do better with that space, at the least

thankfully housing does not require upkeep itself, but we don't pay for pops we don't have jobs for


[25-Jul-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000
hmmm.


[25-Jul-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000
oh, stupid me i decreased instead of increasing


[25-Jul-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000
heh


[25-Jul-24 09:43 PM] tanda#0000
but yeah, that housing is definitely better used for STOs


[25-Jul-24 09:43 PM] tanda#0000
if nothing else the QOL improvement is huge


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] jcheung#0000
at minimum 1 STO is a godsend


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] jcheung#0000
it's like triple the base capacity of CM


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] xtc69#0000
didnt even see that housing lol


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] jcheung#0000
more, actually


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] jcheung#0000
i see stupid things, and then i miss obvious stuff


[25-Jul-24 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, one STO brings you up by 5k storage


[25-Jul-24 09:47 PM] xtc69#0000
StO is housing right the next tier


[25-Jul-24 09:47 PM] jcheung#0000
no


[25-Jul-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
no, STO is storage units


[25-Jul-24 09:47 PM] jcheung#0000
it's a warehouse block


[25-Jul-24 09:47 PM] xtc69#0000

I think my new screen setup has made me start avoiding warehouses in general


[25-Jul-24 09:54 PM] jcheung#0000

Is it not heresy to join other Corp Discords??


[26-Jul-24 11:55 AM] jcheung#0000
ADI isn't a corp


[26-Jul-24 11:55 AM] jcheung#0000
and neither is AA


[26-Jul-24 11:56 AM] jvaler#0000
well


[26-Jul-24 11:57 AM] jvaler#0000
it's the distinction between "group" and "corp" imo. "corps" tend to have more rules regarding member trading behaviors and stuff, like KAWA for example


[26-Jul-24 11:58 AM] jvaler#0000
ADI is a "group" in that you can associate with anyone and really do whatever you want. specific projects/programs *within* ADI tend to have more structure


[26-Jul-24 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I liked to think of ADI as Antares itself, where no matter the corporation we are all the same since we are all Antares.


[26-Jul-24 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
In my eyes the whole exclusivity of corporations is a bit too restrictive and doesn't promote the same level of faction-wide growth as just open cooperation between members of a faction.

I'd recommend it strongly.


[30-Jul-24 01:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
hey ADI, I don't like campaigning in discord but it seems that's the only way to get things done.
I have exciting plans for Nike in making it an example for all Antares planets to follow.
Unfortunately, it seems Rise doesn't feel the same way and would rather spend all the money we have on supposed gains in efficiency that will take a decade in real time to pay off. He would rather increase POPI levels spending millions, to save a couple thousand a week! Sounds ridiculous to me!
Please vote for me, I'm always here to hear any inputs and advice!


[30-Jul-24 01:50 PM] riseoffilth#0000
You use inputs that cost 3mil+ a month to oversupply the planet, claim it‚Äôs all free and from your generosity and charity, and expect folks to thank you for it. Waste is waste. I plan on upgrading the planet and reducing monthly spending by from your 3mil+ down to under 2mil a month. I did it on Phobos and I‚Äôll do it on Nike. You could have done it too, but for some reason, choose more expensive inputs. To me, that‚Äôs bad governing.


[30-Jul-24 01:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
I've said numerous times what my planned expenses are once I no longer am donating old POPI parts. Expected spend: 2.28million


[30-Jul-24 01:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
or about 75k/d


[30-Jul-24 01:51 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And in a couple months when it‚Äôs done and running smoothly, I‚Äôll happily step asside and let someone else run for Gov. If it‚Äôs you, I hope you continue my example.


[30-Jul-24 01:56 PM] jcheung#0000
May i have more details of your "plans" and where they differ from rise's?
With the limited information you have provided so far, i don't particularly see any reason to switch over


[30-Jul-24 02:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
Sure! I'm aiming to utilize the more interesting mechanics, such as reimbursements for any inputs into the COGC through motions for anyone. This will hopefully allow younger players, such as those in ADI, a reasonable way to quickly get rid of some produced items. I hope to extend this to POPI in the future.
Beyond that, now that I'm aware of potential improvements to the POPI levels, I'll take a deeper look at modifying those such that we can maintain a minimum cost going forward.


[30-Jul-24 02:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
I try to have an open door to inputs, and have tried to express that as clearly in game chat as possible. I've been providing weekly updates, something Rise hasn't done on any of his other planets, and aim to continue to provide those so that everyone on the planet can be as informed as possible.
I can show my plan (something Rise seems reticient to do) for POPI and how we aim to keep taxes as low as possible. Thanks to the buffer I've given us this past month in funds, we have options available.


[30-Jul-24 02:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
So far, no one has ever come to me with any concerns. I've been running this planet for well over a year, and am saddened to see that proven history doesn't matter at all.


[30-Jul-24 02:03 PM] hernanduer#0000

[30-Jul-24 02:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes, I'm sorry about that, I'm not sure where or how Rise gets his votes, and I don't particularly like using non-game chat


[30-Jul-24 02:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
but no one seems to use it, we can stop the discussion here if you'd prefer


[30-Jul-24 02:10 PM] Deleted User#0000

Can you define "get rid of produced items"?


[30-Jul-24 02:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
sure, I had excess POPI I was providing because I thought they were more interesting to make


[30-Jul-24 02:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
items like BID


[30-Jul-24 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh, you mean for others to provide to POPI and COGC. I mean that as an outlet for their items, instead of hauling them to the CX


[30-Jul-24 02:14 PM] jcheung#0000
No, i meant define it a bit more as used here


[30-Jul-24 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
with POPI items, I hope it to make sense for others to make and bring the POPI need items to Nike, donate them, and to have reimbursement amounts that incentivize that action.


[30-Jul-24 02:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I hesitate to use the word "donate" since you will be compensated for it


[30-Jul-24 02:16 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Contribute?


[30-Jul-24 02:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah yeah


[30-Jul-24 02:16 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Sell?


[30-Jul-24 02:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe once the store front is in, sell would make sense, but given the delayed repayment, ehhh


[30-Jul-24 02:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
that reimbursement would be a weekly passed motion that includes repayment to all players who have contributed in the past week


[30-Jul-24 02:18 PM] jcheung#0000
Wish i was at my computer to look at more things, but why BID? Is it just literally only to provide a sink for that material / because it's interesting?


[30-Jul-24 02:18 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Do you feel that might be a little spammy for everyone contributing 50 mcg?


[30-Jul-24 02:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
well that was just because I liked the idea of making non-standard items, and since OOG divded dividends the way it did, I would never get back all my money anyways, so I just did what I liked


[30-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's no longer the case


[30-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe, there might need to be a limit of like 1k AIC worth of items


[30-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
you can pass it all in a single motion though, so beyond having to click a dozen contracts or more as a government member, it's not a big deal


[30-Jul-24 02:20 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I always forget that üòÇ. That is a nice feature


[30-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why I was hoping to trial run with the COGC first


[30-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
before adding in POPI in the near future


[30-Jul-24 02:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmm. I mean, doing exotic inputs like that to sink/subsidize those items might be good, but at what cost? How much extra cost a month is there consuming exotic stuff?


[30-Jul-24 02:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh, that's part of the change with my next term (assuming that occurs.) I will no longer be providing those


[30-Jul-24 02:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
that is why the cost comparison Rise made above doesn't make sense - I'm simply emptying old inventory


[30-Jul-24 02:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Btw if it feels like I'm attacking, I'm not trying to-i just only have mobile right now which sucks for research and i only have a month of experience


[30-Jul-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
no no, I'm happy for the questions. I want to understand where everyone is coming from


[30-Jul-24 02:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
for reference, this is my expected plan barring any increase in POPI building levels

@hernanduer some say this, not me of course, but some‚Ä¶ fulfillment numbers have been a bit all over the place in the past month, from 60% down to 20% and now this past week or so, back to 60%+ to 50%s across the board. I‚Äôve heard reports that a 3rd SST input was used. Those same report list that as the most expensive input, where as SST upgrades tend to pretty cheap in the world of POPU inputs. Why not upgrade POPI BUIs instead of using drastically more expensive inputs, across the board? I have the occasional HOG and IDC and what not, but I don‚Äôt throw them away for funsies when cheaper options exist.

hmmm, so this really begs the question


[30-Jul-24 02:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
are you not using the current OFF prices on your planets Rise? How inefficient are you being? HMmmmmmm üòâ


[30-Jul-24 02:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I don‚Äôt use market prices for anything I do


[30-Jul-24 02:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Market prices have no inherent bearing on the actual cost of production with a reasonable markup


[30-Jul-24 02:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
So it'll never make fiscal sense for someone to supply parts for your planets?


[30-Jul-24 02:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Some indirect influence, absolutely.


[30-Jul-24 02:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
Unless you've agreed to some kind of deal


[30-Jul-24 02:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
they could just sell on the CX, after all


[30-Jul-24 02:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If they are buying from market? Absolutely not. Which is why one of my main goals atm is loaning and granting money to people with the goal of increasing global supply of essential items like OFF, to lower CX prices


[30-Jul-24 02:42 PM] jcheung#0000
Rise seems to have his own market lol


[30-Jul-24 02:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It is my dream that one day, anyone can govern with the money collected by taxes, without having a vast collection of bases and excess production to be charitable benefactors, rather than governors, of a planet.


[30-Jul-24 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm aware, there's a whole discord server on it


[30-Jul-24 02:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
To do that, some influence is required to shape the market üòÇ


[30-Jul-24 02:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Tbf, it ain‚Äôt my discord. And it‚Äôs definitely not dedicated to me üòÇ


[30-Jul-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
As a new player though, it really feels like the taxes are super low


[30-Jul-24 02:44 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Kinda sorta not really.


[30-Jul-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
So this can probably be done now if people weren't such bitches about paying taxes


[30-Jul-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
Again, opinion


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If you completely buy from market and are slavish to its prices, it‚Äôs market manipulation, and supply shortages, then absolutely.


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] realharvey#0000
No one has anything against paying taxes if the money is spent in a meaningfull way.


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Because you will pay excessive amounts for regular stuff just because some rich asshole bought it all up.


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Because they can


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Because they know govs will be forced to buy it anyways


[30-Jul-24 02:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I don‚Äôt like to play that game


[30-Jul-24 02:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I like to play my own game and come to a mutually beneficial arrangement for us all. Steady and consistent supply at fair and profitable prices


[30-Jul-24 02:47 PM] riseoffilth#0000
OFF is WILDLY profitable. And you can do it as such, and make like 60k/day per base at 80/u


[30-Jul-24 02:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It just isn‚Äôt a item many people recognize, so getting people to make it at scale requires a push. But once they do? $$$


[30-Jul-24 02:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And that benefits all planets


[30-Jul-24 02:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
idk. there's a lot of factors that go into KAWA's calculations for internal pricing based on ROI. And our prices correlate with CX prices *really* well actually. So I think think the market stabilizes around good prices pretty effectively and shortages resolve themselves fairly efficiently. Our price calculations when compared to CX do make it more apparent what items are *wildly* overpriced though, and OFF is almost on the top of the list right now...


[30-Jul-24 02:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
OFF is almost as overpriced now as HMS was a few months ago, and that stuff was wild

whats the thought on C?


[30-Jul-24 02:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Agri has gone up across the board. I think that, and lack of C production, caused the spike


[30-Jul-24 02:49 PM] igfloz#0000
..or people switching from RAT to C production ?


[30-Jul-24 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
Funnily enough i personally feel like the ease of switching production is actually a negative


[30-Jul-24 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
That rat price increase is scaring me

[30-Jul-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
Guess I better get started on that next FP base


[30-Jul-24 02:55 PM] realharvey#0000
Okay, we're getting a bit far away from the Nike governing discussion. Rise now has the most votes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he will take over the leadership completely. Do you think you can come to an agreement? This discussion so far has been the most rational and free of personal attacks, which I think is very constructive.

Yeah, ideally both of you can compromise and meet somewhere in the middle


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I would have loved to come to an agreement, but he said nothing in government chat about his concerns and instead DMd everyone on the planet to vote for him üò¶


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's the point of the government chat...


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
The only agreement possible now is him to drop and rejoin the race and recoup the votes to be a member


[30-Jul-24 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
And of course I take his input (he does actually have to provide input though) and make things better for everyone


[30-Jul-24 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
I won't be voting to reimburse for POPI level increases though, they don't make sense... (with the current market)


[30-Jul-24 03:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
unless reasonable numbers are provided**


[30-Jul-24 03:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
@hernanduer despite what you think, despite the history, I would not be pushing for the votes for the top spot, if I felt you open to discussion.

We have chatted many a times in many planet and discord chats. You and your Corp have a well known reputation for ignoring and quashing all criticism. You, as well as your Corp are active hostile to feedback. And the way your Corp managed funds before the changes, I abhorrently disagree with. It is theft and mismanagement to the highest degree of planet funds.

But the patch changed that, and being the outsider who complains about stuff and spends hours arguing is not as fun as it once was. I‚Äôm more interested in getting stuff done, and my lingering impression of you is not one of working together. To this day, on (most) every planet a OOG candidate runs on, it is 90% OOG members and almost no one else voting for you. Surely you **MUST** question why that is.


[30-Jul-24 03:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Regardless. I work with Archiel on phobos, I would with paris on various planets, I work with anyone who wants to be worked with. I‚Äôm happy to offer help to all.


[30-Jul-24 03:05 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Ignore everything before this month, I see Nike‚Äôs fulfillment dumb and wasteful, and the concept of charity run planets is ridiculous and ego centric, in my view.


[30-Jul-24 03:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
Eh, well it's a similar spread of poison over time. It'll take time to recover I imagine. I know we disagree with how the funds were kept, we saw it as helping new members. The funds were coming to us anyways (often in very low amounts, OOG consistently had the lowest taxes,) what we did with that money was our discretion. We as a corp chose to spread it around to our newest members.


[30-Jul-24 03:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
I clearly see you think that way at this point. I thought I made it clear my intentions were to build a reasonable wallet


[30-Jul-24 03:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
I made it clear so many times that I would begin withdrawing funds after the first government was over


[30-Jul-24 03:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
and at reasonable amounts - not charity, hell I buy most on the CX


[30-Jul-24 03:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
We needed a buffer, and instead of injecting funds like some players were doing, I chose to let the planet build its own funds


[30-Jul-24 03:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
and I did that by continuing to supply all the POPI I had already manufactured, whether they made the most sense or not, because to me it was about getting Nike into a state to pay for its own needs after this FIRST month


[30-Jul-24 03:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
it also made sense, so the first two weeks, many jobs were still switching off of OOG payment and onto government payment


[30-Jul-24 03:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm not sure how I could've made it any clearer this charity was temporary


[30-Jul-24 03:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
There is clearly a more optimal path that costs less across almost every type of fulfillment. No bullshit, no politics, honest answer. Why not just dig in and invest in POPI BUI upgrades to enable a cheaper operating costs?


[30-Jul-24 03:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I don‚Äôt give a shit about credit. I went for Phobos because it was dumb as rocks what was happening there


[30-Jul-24 03:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
I haven't run the numbers yet because I didn't think we were at a point it needed to be run


[30-Jul-24 03:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I went in, took money, and used it to fix it.


[30-Jul-24 03:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
clearly you had


[30-Jul-24 03:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
you could have brought it up instead of going around my back


[30-Jul-24 03:12 PM] realharvey#0000
hey lets stay away from accusations


[30-Jul-24 03:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
bah, I just mean he's saying it all now, it's clearly something he's been thinking about


[30-Jul-24 03:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
why not mention it?


[30-Jul-24 03:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
he saved it all for the election because why?


[30-Jul-24 03:13 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I could have brought it up, and you, given all previous experience would have ignored me. I have the votes now to force the upgrades and make the planet cheaper to operate for everyone who comes after me


[30-Jul-24 03:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
by using the money I've saved


[30-Jul-24 03:14 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I actually didn‚Äôt. I was kind a looking at things, but not really doing the math. Then you posted in Nike local and I looked at the totals and was like ‚Äúhuh‚Äù, and then went and did the math. That‚Äôs when I was upset and asked for votes


[30-Jul-24 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
I still haven't seen your math though...


[30-Jul-24 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's another part, it's promises but where is the math?


[30-Jul-24 03:14 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I saw an issue, and I could argue it for 2 days while the election ended, or get the votes and force changes I think need to happen


[30-Jul-24 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
you also need 2 seats by the by, not just governor


[30-Jul-24 03:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I trust in Paris‚Äô character that if I have good intentions, he would not oppose me making upgrades to the planet.


[30-Jul-24 03:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe you 2 could block me


[30-Jul-24 03:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I hope you don‚Äôt, but maybe you can.


[30-Jul-24 03:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
the upgrades don't make fiscal sense, show the math


[30-Jul-24 03:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
what's the ROI?


[30-Jul-24 03:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
years?


[30-Jul-24 03:16 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If we can delay this explicit point an hour or 2, I‚Äôd be happy to. I‚Äôm at work still and can‚Äôt quite link spreadsheets so easily


[30-Jul-24 03:16 PM] realharvey#0000
I also had my prejudices about Hernanduer before. But when I spoke to him today about my concerns in a neutral, non-accusatory way, I was very surprised at how objectively you can deal with them.

Unfortunately, you both provoke each other very quickly. But at the end of the day, you're both actually pursuing the same goal.

it really saddens me but that's all people care about

As I‚Äôve stated before, I‚Äôm only in this to improve and upgrade the planet. I have no interest in goving beyond making these upgrades happen, and once it‚Äôs done and settled, I don‚Äôt plan to run on Nike for gov again.

[30-Jul-24 03:23 PM] realharvey#0000
How about this: We wait until Rise is home and then he can share his calculation and why he thinks it's right for us to upgrade POPI infrastructure. We implement this on the planet and you can continue to run the planet and are still open to constructive criticism @hern?


[30-Jul-24 03:24 PM] realharvey#0000
Maybe some people are even donating or selling cheaper Fabs for better infrastructure. Sounds like an all win situation for me


[30-Jul-24 03:26 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I‚Äôve stated my reasons for being skeptical of that working. It is the fact that I spoke to people, who agreed with my concerns and voted for me, that we are able to have this conversation and not be ignored, which is something that has consistently happened in the past.


[30-Jul-24 03:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôve got cheap stuff fabs. I‚Äôve sold to all y‚Äôall at low prices before. @riseoffilth , I get your motivation in terms of POPI upgrades. It just feels a little in bad faith to not at least mention it in gov or planet chat first


[30-Jul-24 03:27 PM] realharvey#0000
I actually don't agree this time. Even before Hern noticed that you've been in the lead in terms of votes hern has been well responding to other opionions and was open for discussion


[30-Jul-24 03:28 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Before he asked for votes, we were neck and neck naturally for 4 days straight. So I did too, and shared my reasons for doing so. People agreed, that that‚Äôs why this conversation is happening and being taken seriously


[30-Jul-24 03:28 PM] realharvey#0000
And I am just talking about "today". I know how discussed between you went before


[30-Jul-24 03:29 PM] realharvey#0000
I think you have a lot of prejudices about each other


[30-Jul-24 03:31 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Historical prescient has influenced me, previous chats in Nike local of missed and unfulfilled COGCs, of negative engineer growth when there are already open jobs. And what happens when these problems have been called out before? Criticism and insults at those who raise concerns, not an acknowledgment of error and mistakes.


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yes I understand that, but you‚Äôve also put out your fair share of criticism and insults man. I just feel like this was a missed opportunity to work together, that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm not trying to come after either of you


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'd agree, but I tried to make it clear it's supposed to be a fresh start


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It is


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
and we had a decent conversation in government chat


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
NOT about this, obviously


[30-Jul-24 03:32 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Hence my straight forward candor.


[30-Jul-24 03:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
I won‚Äôt get any more involved than that. I like working with both of you. Just feel that this could have gone differently, that‚Äôs all


[30-Jul-24 03:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
and that's why to me it's more a betrayal


[30-Jul-24 03:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000

I was hoping we were on a similar path here, but yeah


[30-Jul-24 03:37 PM] realharvey#0000
So far, Rise has not had the impression that if he makes a suggestion, you would agree to it or work on it together. (With your past I think you can understand that) So I wouldn't say it's betrayal.

But the way it looks here now, you two can have an objective discussion.


[30-Jul-24 03:38 PM] riseoffilth#0000
You‚Äôre match making and diplomatic tone is making me gag.

[30-Jul-24 03:38 PM] realharvey#0000
you cant argue with that booty


[30-Jul-24 03:42 PM] realharvey#0000
There are only two possibilities: Either you both wage ‚Äúwar‚Äù and see who can gain the most influence in Nike, or you work together to see what's best.

I know Rise's calculations, so I believe him when he says that POPI infrastructure upgrades are cheaper at the end of the day.

But I also like Hern's ideas and I think that with less planets to run, he can look into it more.


[30-Jul-24 03:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
My concern about the calculations is: are they "Rise" numbers, or are they real numbers? Because I want it to make sense for others to contribute


[30-Jul-24 03:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
and if they can just take it to the CX, well...


[30-Jul-24 03:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
but we can talk about that after, if I'm no longer governor then that's a permanent decision. I'll take my cares somewhere else, we're making fun things in far reaches with gateways coming soon


[30-Jul-24 03:44 PM] realharvey#0000
you can still mainly run the planet


[30-Jul-24 03:45 PM] realharvey#0000
and rise said after POPI-Upgrades are done he'll stay away from elections on nike


[30-Jul-24 03:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
eh, sure, but clearly people would rather he run it than me, based on the votes


[30-Jul-24 03:45 PM] realharvey#0000
But thats just because Rise has way more influence


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Disagree


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
yep


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why it's his choice on what to do


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I didn‚Äôt message most people and say, do you know me? Vote for me because you know me


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúsee my OOG ticker? See my Corp affiliation? Vote for me‚Äù

I said ‚Äúlook at the POPI inputs. Those are not the cheapest inputs. I will upgrade the infrastructure and leave in 2 months. If you agree with that, vote for me‚Äù‚Äù


[30-Jul-24 03:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
sure, but I've shown you what my actual plan is

[30-Jul-24 03:49 PM] igfloz#0000
ok ok.... I have read most of this and I am (happily) surprised that there has been discussion here (with some err, moderation ?) - but both of you sometimes react badly and give (in my opinion) a petulant reaction. You both seem to be still arguing the same points and looking to dig a little more just for effect. Let Rise get home, produce figures, make a substantial case, etc. etc. - discussion can continue obviously, but just calm down üôÇ


[30-Jul-24 03:49 PM] realharvey#0000
Let's be honest. With your influence you can frame most things the way you want


[30-Jul-24 03:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000

@hernanduer I think if you can live with not having the most votes for a month and agree to the POPI Infrastructure upgrades that rise proposes you can actually keep governing the planet the way you did it. (As long as you respond well to **objective **criticism.) (And I hope your numbers are correct rise üëÄ üòÇ )


[30-Jul-24 03:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
No, I don't want to continue running


[30-Jul-24 03:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
after this election (if I lose)


[30-Jul-24 03:58 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 03:58 PM] riseoffilth#0000

@akyantor said before and I‚Äôll say again, love to have new people in office learning about the game. I like less the ‚Äúvote [xxx] no matter what‚Äù crowd, but in this case, I support the result, if not the method.


[30-Jul-24 04:05 PM] akyantor#0000
It's fair to say that no-one has a perpetual right to govern a planet. Also fair to feel frustrated if you're pationate about the work you've done to look after a planet, and don't feel like folks respond/support that effort.


[30-Jul-24 04:06 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Without a doubt. It is my sincere hope that once the products start hitting the market from the efforts I‚Äôve pushed to make cheaper gov POPI products, it will be more accessible to everyday folks


[30-Jul-24 04:06 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, and that's definitely a good thing.


[30-Jul-24 04:06 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And therefore making governing more accessible


[30-Jul-24 04:07 PM] akyantor#0000
More governing folks pinning upkeep costs to the market also will encourage more folks to get interested in upkeep good production.


[30-Jul-24 04:07 PM] akyantor#0000
In a transparent way.

[30-Jul-24 04:07 PM] hernanduer#0000

[30-Jul-24 04:08 PM] realharvey#0000

[30-Jul-24 04:08 PM] realharvey#0000
but campaigning in politics has never been easy


[30-Jul-24 04:08 PM] realharvey#0000
I''d love if people that go voting actually read the party-programms


[30-Jul-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
because a lot of people actually vote against their own interests


[30-Jul-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
but thats just how things are


[30-Jul-24 04:09 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, it'd be good if more folks too an interest. There's still remarkably few people who engage at all.


[30-Jul-24 04:09 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Like the many times people vote for the sitting(while afk) governors in elections past

[30-Jul-24 05:24 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and even if you did, I wouldnt. Governors arent kings, no one is entitled to it. I want elections based on merit and ideas, on plans and eventually actions. After the way (#1) OOG collects money and (#2) attacks dissent, my 3rd least favorite thing about OOG (in the past üòâ ) is that protectionism of your members to your own candidates, even when it is clear they are unfit, inactive, or inattentive. It is my contention, forgoing everything before this past month, that you are unfit given your poor usage of expensive popi inputs and lack of urgency or stated planning to upgrade POPI BUI. 


For an example of this, you can just look at ENG numbers of the last 4-5 POPRs, ENG went from 15% to .5% (now going back up). While this isnt inherently bad and population does fluctuate, there is clearly inconsistent fulfillment levels. I cant speak as to what was in the POPI 4 weeks ago, but what I see now is dumb. I realize youve addressed this by saying you make it yourself and were getting rid of some items that you dont use anymore? idk.

-To me, BID in the VRT just doesnt make sense. Why would you not sell that and use the money more efficiently? 
-Why put TUB and HD into UNI, and let one run out? We DONT EVEN USE SCI. like. WHY. education has minimal impact other pops and isnt cost efficient, certanly not with 2 inputs, let alone 1.
-ACA. You put in Glass. Glass? Glass. DW is cheapest. Why glass? Don't say you make it yourself. you could by 2x as much DW by selling the glass.
-PAR: PFE input costs 40% more than DW. SOI input costs 80% than DW. upgrading PAR seems the clear choice. Yes it is expensive, but it literally lasts forever, and PAR/comfort is REQUIRED for literally as long as the server runs. I get ROI is a like, a big thing to some people. But Id almost always rather invest a couple mil in upgrading a planet to make it permanently better and cheaper than weasel and say "*oh well its cheaper this way as long as the server is reset in 6 months*"


[30-Jul-24 05:27 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and for the SST and INF, i dont think ive ever seen any person with more brain cells than fingers use 2 inputs on a INF. It is so cheap to use. It goes from being 800/day/level to 3300/day/level. TUB is 3x as expensive. and SST and INFs are the cheapest POPI build costs of any of them


[30-Jul-24 05:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
again, rude


[30-Jul-24 05:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and like, I just dont even think any change is needed at all on SST, just stop using the 3rd input. OFF price aside, its not a difficult production to stand up. And 145 is an insane price. there is no way anyone or someone around couldnt produce some for you much cheaper, below 100


[30-Jul-24 05:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
literally, ill sell it to you for 80/u


[30-Jul-24 05:30 PM] riseoffilth#0000
it sounds harsh, but its just my way of being emphatic


[30-Jul-24 05:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's really not, you basically called me retarded


[30-Jul-24 05:31 PM] riseoffilth#0000
i'll amend. "Current company excluded, who are possibly just na√Øve"


[30-Jul-24 05:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
To bring this to my original point. I would not drop out, because I despise the way OOG votes as a block, without looking at the merits of the candidate. And I have presented what I believe are legitimate grievances, and voter apathy aside, people voted for me in good faith.

You are welcome to offer a rebuttal and swear up and down about your plans and motivations and goals and intents. You should earn your votes through actions and promises kept, not by the corp tag next to your name. I'm not going to do what you should be doing every day, which is earning the votes through those actions and promises kept.


[30-Jul-24 05:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
You didn't earn your votes beyond making the effort to go bother people to vote, that's why it's saddening that that's all it takes


[30-Jul-24 05:36 PM] riseoffilth#0000
There are days left to make your case ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[30-Jul-24 05:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
as far as these concerns, instead of bringing them to the parliament, you've elected to play the political game solo and make sure you win


[30-Jul-24 05:36 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 05:37 PM] riseoffilth#0000
some folks in this very chat and discord are voters


[30-Jul-24 05:37 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Convince them ( and then keep those promises)


[30-Jul-24 05:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's why I came here


[30-Jul-24 05:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll ignore your critique of the input choices, since I've made clear about a dozen times that those will be cleaned up once I start paying myself


[30-Jul-24 05:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
For INF to be a single input, you will need to upgrade it to minimum level 8 - that's about 1.5-2mil in costs


[30-Jul-24 05:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
for the PAR to upgrade to level 6, that drops you to DW and PFE only, you'll need another 1mil


[30-Jul-24 05:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
all these changes, and you drop the per day cost by maybe 12k


[30-Jul-24 05:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
that will take 8 months to recoup, so yeah, not forever


[30-Jul-24 05:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
let's say we drop the HD from the UNI, now you actually need PAR 7 - that's another 750k


[30-Jul-24 05:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
and only drops your cost by 3k


[30-Jul-24 05:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
and this is all sitting with ENG right at 50% - which gets you basically the numbers you see now, 0-4% unemployment


[30-Jul-24 05:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
the coffers won't even pay for all of these changes at once


[30-Jul-24 05:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
and maintenance - so you're also saying to drain all the money I've donated


[30-Jul-24 05:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
because that's what it is - the taxes haven't paid for it yet - it's donations from me


[30-Jul-24 05:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
and then what? claim some moral victory here? some efficiency victory? I don't really understand. The money you want to use to do this didn't just appear out of nowhere


[30-Jul-24 05:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
I donated to allow the planet/government to build a wallet which it can later use for improvements. If we use it here for these changes, excellent. But you act like my own ineptitude has gotten us into some sort of hole, when it's exactly my own choices that give you the ability to make the choices you want to make!


[30-Jul-24 05:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
You're literally using my money, making these changes, and then calling me a retard for giving you the money to make those changes


[30-Jul-24 05:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
like what


[30-Jul-24 05:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
lets say 8. thats 3 levels, from 5-8.

What QTYs and prices are you using to create that number?


[30-Jul-24 05:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
cause im looking at 250-300k per level or so


[30-Jul-24 05:50 PM] riseoffilth#0000
(ignoring the building materials already in it)

cause I think I can reasonably say, I can procure BBH at 1800/u, bde 1700, bse 1500, bta 1000, tru 300, mcg 30


[30-Jul-24 05:51 PM] riseoffilth#0000
my math says level 5-6 is 266k


[30-Jul-24 05:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
With market prices, 213 BBH/BDE, 142 BSE, 106 BTA, somewhere around 1.5mil


[30-Jul-24 05:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's not fair to use internal prices, you said that a bunch of times


[30-Jul-24 05:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Hern, wasnt one of the greatest arguments and responses to my criticisms against OOG and their method for collecting money for various planets that "The size of our corporation and internal economy allows us to run and produce things cheaply, to source material to build planets no one else could"


[30-Jul-24 05:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and your telling me, that no one in your corp has BBH for anything less than CX


[30-Jul-24 05:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
people come and go, no one's making excess bfabs


[30-Jul-24 05:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
or if they are, I don't see why it's fair to charge them less to upgrade the planet


[30-Jul-24 05:55 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I never said it wasnt fair, I said I never use market prices, because its heavily manipulated


[30-Jul-24 05:56 PM] riseoffilth#0000
real cost of production is completely separate than MMs or whatever Bfabs are bouncing off of these days


[30-Jul-24 05:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think as a public facing entity, you should always use the market


[30-Jul-24 05:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
privately, do whatever, but governments should always use the CX prices


[30-Jul-24 05:56 PM] riseoffilth#0000
That would make planets subject to any type of market manipulation across any possible input


[30-Jul-24 05:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
they're funded by the people, they should pay people price - if the government of a planet thinks it's wise to stockpile to avoid people doing very naughty things - then that's the government's perogative


[30-Jul-24 05:57 PM] riseoffilth#0000
"huh, the only OFF for sale is 10k per unit. Well, Hern said, we have to buy, WEEEEEeee" and brrrrrr goes the planet wallet lol??


[30-Jul-24 05:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
but you see, no one is ever going to help pay for the government if you do everything with special prices


[30-Jul-24 05:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
why would I contribute OFF when I can sell it on the CX for more?


[30-Jul-24 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
it makes no sense - you have to use market prices updated regularly


[30-Jul-24 05:58 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Why would I ever give a friend a discount on any product?


[30-Jul-24 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
why does a planet have a friend?


[30-Jul-24 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
you're representing a planet, not yourself


[30-Jul-24 05:58 PM] riseoffilth#0000
because its treated us all so well

[30-Jul-24 05:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
my point stands on the initial betrayal of the mechanics - we should've had this whole conversation in government chat


[30-Jul-24 06:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
not out here - you didn't even try, despite your reservations (which I... somewhat understand)


[30-Jul-24 06:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
very much makes you out to play by yourself basically


[30-Jul-24 06:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
my way or the highway


[30-Jul-24 06:01 PM] riseoffilth#0000
My point stands that OOG has historical precedent for having a "join OOG or we vote you out" mentality and reacts to any and all criticism or complaints with excuses and hostile attitudes.


[30-Jul-24 06:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
man like I said, people come and go, and idk who was here before I even started playing, but it sounds like they were the one to give you that initial impression


[30-Jul-24 06:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
that was like, 1.5 years ago


[30-Jul-24 06:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
are we cliquey though? Well yeah, that's the point of a guild, you stick together

that's our (OOG) greatest fear, given the number of planets you're supplying


[30-Jul-24 06:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
it'd literally crash Antares


[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yo


[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000

and not just "rely on market"


[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[30-Jul-24 06:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think everyone here knows how much influence that's given you


[30-Jul-24 06:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
and despite your protests, AA is basically centered on you


[30-Jul-24 06:08 PM] riseoffilth#0000
dont tell Bob that


[30-Jul-24 06:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
Bob is quiet, only Deimos people even know him


[30-Jul-24 06:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's kind of our concern, without you there leading it, who knows what'll happen. Maybe good, maybe bad. But risk analysis says 1 guy running 30 planets and twice as many _other people's_ bases, is concerning to us


[30-Jul-24 06:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
again though, distracting from initial conversation. This is just our current thoughts on the "Rise running all of ANT space" line of thinking


[30-Jul-24 06:10 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If I'm done being sarcastic and otherwise flippant, I am very aware of the vulnerability of centering power on myself. The great strength in a strong center figure is also a weakness. Hence why I am giving out money and bases as quickly as I can for supporting the industries necessary for governing cheaply and effectively.


[30-Jul-24 06:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and why I am always seeking new people to involve in parliament and goving to hand off responsibility to


[30-Jul-24 06:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and why on Nike, gaining the Gov seat will give me the power to effect and enact what I feel is the necessary change. After this 1-2 months, I will not seek the governorship


[30-Jul-24 06:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
well let's hope it doesn't crash and burn


[30-Jul-24 06:12 PM] riseoffilth#0000
similarly, I plan on stepping back from at least half of planets I currently gov by Nov or so. Maybe new year


[30-Jul-24 06:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's basically what I'm saying about Phobos too since it's only been a month


[30-Jul-24 06:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
your main hiccup here is you're not getting people to use the CX


[30-Jul-24 06:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
so you'll have to coordinate these handoffs of contracts between other players


[30-Jul-24 06:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
for supplying things - and also they'll have to be responsible for sourcing more of those items


[30-Jul-24 06:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
if that person quits or whatever


[30-Jul-24 06:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's just not a lot of resiliency


[30-Jul-24 06:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If only there was a hub of communication that we could all be in, and share and list resources outside of the market, which is infinitely vulnerable to manipulation


[30-Jul-24 06:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
clearly you weren't done


[30-Jul-24 06:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and by the strength of friendship and this place of *discord*, we could ensure a healthy system to prevent abuse and manipulation

[30-Jul-24 06:17 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I feel confident in the system we are building


[30-Jul-24 06:23 PM] riseoffilth#0000
At the risk of speaking of grand economic theories, I think the CX is an incredibly poor metric and standard to hold any pricing to. An organized and coordinated internal market among a capable and diverse group of individuals, able to respond to supply changes and pricing manipulations, is the best possible way to ensure integrity and to prevent abuse. This is not to say we shouldnt participate in the market, but that we should keep lines of communication open and trading amongst ourselves flowing for important projects. In a perfect world, we would be able to produce enough supply to force the market to a certain price point and standardize things, but I fear that given this is a game lacking certain legal regulations, it would always be vulnerable to bad actors.


[30-Jul-24 06:23 PM] riseoffilth#0000
So, I will continue to work towards that and use a reasonable internal pricing.


[30-Jul-24 06:24 PM] riseoffilth#0000
So, on that, I can upgrade the INF to 8 for 900k, ezpz


[30-Jul-24 06:24 PM] riseoffilth#0000
next question


[30-Jul-24 06:28 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and you can too, for a higher price, but I think Nike can afford it. You could raise the taxes in line with other planets, (say a 10-20% depending on pop), but even if you didnt, youve run the planet for 2 years or something? When we start getting into the years territory, upgrading things to save on higher inputs and the ROI you get from it stops being as daunting.


[30-Jul-24 06:28 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Personally, I think its likely the game/server will still be running in a year or 2


[30-Jul-24 06:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
unless there is some outrageous ROI, I'm all in on pushing the planet to upgrade so that it is cheaper and easily to maintain in the long haul.


[30-Jul-24 06:30 PM] riseoffilth#0000
By my estimations, by having some targeted upgrades, you can drop the 3.3mil+ **we** are spending in my internal price value, to 1.8mil internal price value


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
you've spent most of the conversation talking about inefficiencies on prices, but then go to use solely your internal market which I don't have access to


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
see how that's not fair?


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Well, SILLY, here ya go


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
well I still mean that it's not something others have access to either


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's exclusionary - quite literally what you're complaining OOG is doing


[30-Jul-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
(or was doing)


[30-Jul-24 06:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's a separate market outside the game and, despite gripes about the CX, the CX will never get used if you don't try to

[30-Jul-24 06:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
so my greatest concern now, with you taking over, is that Nike will forever be stuck with your market, since its taxes will be set to your internal prices

not external CX prices

[30-Jul-24 06:39 PM] riseoffilth#0000
@hernanduer BUT YO, this is like, a perfect opportunity to harmonize and come together. What if we standardized internal pricing on some key goods. Maybe push a newbie or two to dedicated some production. Sell to market at whatever, drive prices down, but hold some in reserve for governing support.

OFF, DW(maybe? price is pretty good atm), UTS, HD, PFE?


[30-Jul-24 06:39 PM] riseoffilth#0000

i know yall have an internal market, though from my understanding, its like some bidding chaos or something insane


[30-Jul-24 06:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
we can offer that to anyone in Antares who is a governor


[30-Jul-24 06:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Internal price, profitable, absolutely profitable, but not reliant or standardized from the CX


[30-Jul-24 06:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
You're still taking over my governance on the planet without any pre discussion, so any sort of harmony like that would have to wait or be with someone else

1. I was just gonna give you cash cause i have too much


[30-Jul-24 11:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
2. We, the collective we, are always looking for new players to invest in and offer loans to build up their bases, and get new bases, to produce materials essential to our existing industries, or to supply the market to fix what we perceive is a shortage.


[30-Jul-24 11:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
its not a literal "give" of permit, more a "Hey, here is money. Go set up a base here and make this thing we like and sell it back to us"


[30-Jul-24 11:42 PM] revoric#0000
noooow im understanding lol


[30-Jul-24 11:44 PM] revoric#0000

do you have any particular interests?


[30-Jul-24 11:46 PM] revoric#0000
one of my personal goals would be to make a branch of planets ( with multiple players)  far from a cx producing enough to sustain itself.

[31-Jul-24 12:04 AM] revoric#0000
currently i have only been thinking in terms of what my needs are, though probably a mistake to try to do everything on any scale less then dedicating a planet to one industry.


[31-Jul-24 12:09 AM] jcheung#0000

[31-Jul-24 12:10 AM] riseoffilth#0000

[31-Jul-24 01:35 AM] finestone#0000
Setting up Pop Infrastructure and governing an outback planet sounds like a fun goal! it will be expensive and will need constant pop upkeep. though for really small pop planets with just pioneers i think just DW can last them a while. It also depends on which pops that you (and others) are going to use on the planet. Are other people going to go live out there with you? more people = more upkeep. So you will need a good financial base and some capitol to initiate.


[31-Jul-24 01:44 AM] finestone#0000
If you are simply wanting to setup the basic infrastructure for unsettled planets you wont have to go to far just try to find good planets. Then once people move in you could "hand off" the governship and upkeep to them and go "colonize" more planets but that will take time. The farther away the planet from a CX the less appealing due to transportation costs. You could also advertise giving people colonization "packs" that have a lot of the basic goods to entice them to move to your settled planets as an idea. All in all this will be a huge net drain on your wallet but could prove to be a fun time. Hope this summary helps.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 AM] realharvey#0000
You'll also have to run a lot of supplies down there in the beginning. And you need a lot of ships for that. The further away the more ships you are going to need

Long Story short: Discussion about Nike was way more friendly. 

Hern feels like rise winning the election was hostile and would have liked if he adressed his concerns with him before gaterhing votes for the overtake.

Rise explained on why he did that and what he is planning to do with nike and that he wants to give up leadership after he fixed what he felt needs fixing

Hern is sad about the lack of appreciation from the community and not getting votes even tho he run nike for a long time with almost no hickups and has no current plans to get back to nike when rise takes the lead no matter for how long

Though to be clear, harmonia should make GRN or HER. Life and HYFs should make the HCP


[31-Jul-24 01:23 PM] riseoffilth#0000
HCP is a more expensive recipe than GRN at farms

Nevermind me, GRN => C is the best currently


[31-Jul-24 01:41 PM] jcheung#0000
I think the main question if you have both a FRM world and INC world, is do you want to optimize for yield per time, or yield per input


[31-Jul-24 01:47 PM] razenpok#0000
You want to optimize space bucks per everything ü´∞

All of them are gaseous, so that means AEF instead of MCG


[31-Jul-24 01:58 PM] jvaler#0000
i think that's a false dichotomy tbh

you just wanna optimize for consuming your entire agri output, which will always be best yield and best speed cause it's the most you can do with your agri.

low agri output is single input GRN C, higher output is a mix of single input and double input, higher than that is full double input, etc.


[31-Jul-24 01:59 PM] jvaler#0000
i guess the real question is "do i want more INC to run more single input orders or do i just want to use a higher input recipe"

that would actually be a nice feature for it. have an input that lets you put in an "estimated" amount of fuel for input/output flights


[31-Jul-24 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000
There was a fuel price change? You mean like MM?


[31-Jul-24 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000
I kind of do


[31-Jul-24 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000
I need to do it more though


[31-Jul-24 02:42 PM] revoric#0000
i wonder if it would be useful to make fuel depots. we all use fuel lol


[31-Jul-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
I just use the cx as a depot now


[31-Jul-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
And drop a couple hundred on each base for when i inevitably forget


[31-Jul-24 02:43 PM] revoric#0000
as im sure 90% do


[31-Jul-24 02:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
We need gate system that goes from every planet to CX... Not local markets or Fuel depots


[31-Jul-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
(Made use ofthose piles this week, thrice. See if i remember to refill them)


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] revoric#0000
oh? will we ever get the ability to build such gates?


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Soonish


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
currently in development


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
first wave will be Planet Gov owned


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
later by players


[31-Jul-24 02:45 PM] revoric#0000
npc with their cool tech


[31-Jul-24 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
My main question though, is.... will these gate distance limits operate through jumps, or through physical proximity of the stars


[31-Jul-24 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Because if by physical proximity, there's a few trails that could cut a lot of jump distance off


[31-Jul-24 02:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
we will see, I don't think it was explaned yet


[31-Jul-24 02:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
I wonder if it would work like Gates from X universe


[31-Jul-24 02:50 PM] .shiva.#0000
NPC is a little misleading, the inital ones are *Government* owned


[31-Jul-24 02:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah probably should say, 'neutral' owned


[31-Jul-24 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
Eh. I could see rise as a npc


[31-Jul-24 02:52 PM] revoric#0000
lol


[31-Jul-24 02:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
I see what you mean now

Oh. I mean it's climed overall in the last year from what i can tell


[31-Jul-24 03:06 PM] revoric#0000
does that mean more people burning it and less people making it?


[31-Jul-24 05:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

Also progress on the gateways seems a lot faster than what I am used to


[31-Jul-24 05:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I wonder how they pull it off to make it fun. It'd be boring if every planet had a direct jump to the CX


[31-Jul-24 05:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Unless it's made to be expensive enough to build/maintain


[31-Jul-24 05:26 PM] jvaler#0000
i still see ppl saying bad things about fuel refining start lol


[31-Jul-24 05:26 PM] revoric#0000
do we have any fuel engineers on here now? Harmony seems like a good H planet, QJ-382f has he3, though it is far for me and its seems we are starved a bit for easy he3 sources in faction territory


[31-Jul-24 05:26 PM] revoric#0000

we have one but he doesn't post on cx i think he just does a bit for himself and occasionally adi internal


[31-Jul-24 05:29 PM] jvaler#0000
but yeah you'll have to go outside of faction space for HE3

How long (approxiamatly) does it take you to sell Al?


[01-Aug-24 08:30 AM] jcheung#0000
depends on how much you want for it


[01-Aug-24 08:30 AM] jcheung#0000
if you sell at bid price, instant.


[01-Aug-24 08:31 AM] jcheung#0000
for the moment, asking for around 800 is pretty reasonable and can offload over a couple days


[01-Aug-24 08:31 AM] jcheung#0000
but AL price looks like it's slowly starting to come on down


[01-Aug-24 08:40 AM] perac1#0000
And, if I cancel my selling order and I don't have any ships at station, does my Al stay at station, or it dissapears?


[01-Aug-24 08:41 AM] jcheung#0000
No warehouse?


[01-Aug-24 08:42 AM] perac1#0000

FIO offers perms, for those interested, to view current stocks, if you're interested, along with those who use it regularly...


[04-Aug-24 03:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
On a to/fro relationship though.


[04-Aug-24 03:16 PM] jvaler#0000
ik we use that in AA projects. but it doesn't let you set buffer amounts. i've heard KAWA has an in-corp bot that *does* let you set buffer amounts, but i don't know much about it


[04-Aug-24 03:18 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Buffer? Meh. You've set your prices. Can setup a #Thread_Store somewhere, where you want it posted. Takes some intake though, for FIO settings edits.


[04-Aug-24 03:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Of course ---- as-is. It doesn't work for short-term deals.


[04-Aug-24 03:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Better for long-term stuff.


[04-Aug-24 03:19 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah the FIO settings are way too big of a hassle to guide every new player through that wants to buy from me


[04-Aug-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can probably think of Commodity.Classes. It would be easier to tier up people, in that regard.


[04-Aug-24 03:20 PM] akyantor#0000
I think the easiest way to consolodate an internal store is to ask folks to publish a CSV version of their store page in a prescribed format. You can then create a sheet that pulls each of them in (it'd require a one off action for each new storefront). *It's conceptually the same as how sidepipe, I and others, publish now, just switching from HTML to CSV, and in a consistant structure.*


[04-Aug-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Idk what your're offering though. Short reccommend.


[04-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jvaler#0000
like what tanda has? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTurW5x7j7Puz9hKpoI5wvLw0W0dr9OvkzDgMotlLT1NI8mE7cie_VWb1vmK5W6RZRo34mPQxCZRgaV/pubhtml?gid=1964780185&single=true

i've tried to extract data from these before but everything online says it isn't possible


[04-Aug-24 03:21 PM] akyantor#0000
There's an option to publish these as CSV rather than HTML.


[04-Aug-24 03:21 PM] akyantor#0000
Let me create an example


[04-Aug-24 03:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Test it with someone in here....


[04-Aug-24 03:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If it's easy, portable, ready to understand, and actionable, you may have something viable.


[04-Aug-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
Here's an example for my storefront:
- [HTML Version](https://ingenious.foo/store)
- [CSV Version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQyIiYe6LaI_KVXb6uIcf3XHnLOBdl3MxU5koX8JtnhCvhefnH_YDTzCVkbmT7qCF4QMxIvGVtMIVAP/pub?gid=2074260768&single=true&output=csv)

You can import the later into your own Google sheet using this formula: 
=IMPORTDATA("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQyIiYe6LaI_KVXb6uIcf3XHnLOBdl3MxU5koX8JtnhCvhefnH_YDTzCVkbmT7qCF4QMxIvGVtMIVAP/pub?gid=2074260768&single=true&output=csv")


[04-Aug-24 03:27 PM] akyantor#0000
If everyone uses that same CSV format, then should be fairly straightforward to create a consolodated store.


[04-Aug-24 03:28 PM] jvaler#0000
oh and so if you only publish the sheet without the IMPORTDATA you can hide the auth key?


[04-Aug-24 03:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Will still need some sort of organization, to keep everyone's post up-to-date... A discord thread maybe?


[04-Aug-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
Correct. You don't need any key, just import the data. The keys are all within the persons own sheet, sharing only those materials they wish to include in the CSV


[04-Aug-24 03:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And what if you don't parktake in sheets?


[04-Aug-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
Then you'd have to stick with the oldschool post method ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[04-Aug-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
Any solution would require some tool that not everyone might use.


[04-Aug-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
I don't think this would be a mandatory thing for internal offers, just an optional optimisaiton.


[04-Aug-24 03:32 PM] jvaler#0000
it's not necessary, but having everything consolidated could make it much easier to find what you need


[04-Aug-24 03:33 PM] akyantor#0000
100%


[04-Aug-24 03:33 PM] akyantor#0000

[04-Aug-24 03:34 PM] akyantor#0000
But that unblocks that bit at least.


[04-Aug-24 03:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

#market-forces


[04-Aug-24 03:37 PM] jcheung#0000
I have an idea for that. If the storefronts are created alike, then you can have another sheet reference them and complile them into a master list


[04-Aug-24 03:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd recommend pins and/or threads for such use, especially if more go after it.


[04-Aug-24 03:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Individual updates are preferred.


[04-Aug-24 03:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Master updates have a common point of failure, that who will likely be sending out the conts....

Can you fully read what i said, and what i replied to?


[04-Aug-24 03:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I agree to what you said. Differ on the method of implementation.


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Compilation is a different step, which is seperate from the user, who creates their own sheets.


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Unless you'd like to do that for everyone.


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
Clearly you didn't, because individual updates was what i said, with an automatic compilation


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Then, you become the weakest link, of potential failure, if ever something RL happens..... Second sentence (second clause)


[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
First sentence, I agree.


[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Fully.


[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm sorry, have you actually utilized google sheets before?


[04-Aug-24 03:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I only use G-docs, for a copy of Archiel's Gov sheet (this is direct feedback, through market research inquiries)...


[04-Aug-24 03:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not everyone is familiar, or uses G-sheets thoroughly, or well.


[04-Aug-24 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
There are dozens of skilled programmers in here, which are basically really advanced spreadsheet users. I'm sure that if i make something and then fall off the wagon, they could pick up the slack


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, programmers. I don't make my IRL money, in programming. Nor do others.


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You know your stuff, probably a good # of others do as well..... But that's limiting the scope of what you want done.


[04-Aug-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Alright. What is your automated information collection and sorting idea that doesn't rely on an individual to operate it all


[04-Aug-24 03:46 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It doesn't have to be an #all-done-by-you thing either. I'm just pointing out a serious concern, that can maybe be worked on by another.


[04-Aug-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Because pins and threads aren't it, since that's basically the current system


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Elaborate your methodology. Pins/threads are a discord thing. If it can be done via g-docs simply, 'splain it.


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just so that everyone's on the same page.


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
I can't to someone who thinks that if i make something in google sheets and i walk into a black hole that nobody can pick up the slack


[04-Aug-24 03:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Simple language. I can probably help you do with what is needed, but I like to talk dumb, while knowing, that I also know a fair bit of programming.


[04-Aug-24 03:49 PM] jcheung#0000
I have my doubts


[04-Aug-24 03:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm not trying to dick you down, I'm just trying to make attempt, at a minimally-viable product.


[04-Aug-24 03:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Something you can pitch to most people, who will get your idea, like it, and contribute.


[04-Aug-24 03:49 PM] jvaler#0000
the whole idea of this is to move the storefronts off of discord, that way stock can be updated by FIO instead of manually.

each person will have their own sheet template for them to input their data into (what's for sale, their prices, desired buffers, etc.), then they will publish their processed data into a web .csv.

i will then take everyone's published .csv's and compile them in my own spreadsheet so that everyone's information can be viewed and searched for in one place

^^ Yes.


[04-Aug-24 03:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@jvaler has it --- but 1-2 more people, who will do "mirrors" of what's done, would be great.....


[04-Aug-24 03:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Redundancies, if ever @jvaler goes dark, for whatever reason.


[04-Aug-24 03:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
or just share admin perms, via gsheets.


[04-Aug-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Why the hell do you need to mirror


[04-Aug-24 03:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not my problem üòõ


[04-Aug-24 03:52 PM] jvaler#0000
if i go dark ADI goes dark lol. if i'm not online there's no way for me to hand off the server's ownership to someone else


[04-Aug-24 03:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
LOL


[04-Aug-24 03:52 PM] jvaler#0000
so redundancy in an internal offers spreadsheet is like a secondary worry if i happen to dissapear


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
but unless i die that's not gonna happen


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, think we're overthinking it. If everyone publishes a CSV in the same format, it's a very small job to build a new version of the combined storefront.


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Married?! Kids!? Old?!


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Sry, but I have to ask.

You don't have to give me details...


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
no i'm very young lol


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Even so, you can simply just... not check the box that disallows copying


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No issues apparently....


[04-Aug-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
most likely cause of death would probably be from a car


[04-Aug-24 03:54 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Fair response, which covers my issue.l


[04-Aug-24 03:54 PM] jcheung#0000
And so long as google doesn't discontinue sheets, a copy will be available


[04-Aug-24 03:54 PM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah this is true too


[04-Aug-24 03:54 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, it looks like there's a viable concept.... Now a product test.


[04-Aug-24 03:54 PM] jcheung#0000
No we, only one of us things it would be difficult


[04-Aug-24 03:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Gimme a populated test sheet. I will tell you what I think of it, and so with others. Discord poll for community input.


[04-Aug-24 03:55 PM] evany.#0000
whats an ELP


[04-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm i'm gonna get feedback on the process. i need to know what people value to be put in the template


[04-Aug-24 03:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
[BUI.ELP] in APEX game


[04-Aug-24 03:56 PM] evany.#0000
thx


[04-Aug-24 03:56 PM] jvaler#0000
like, do people need the ability to set sale locations on planets or is having everything assumed to be on ANT enough?


[04-Aug-24 03:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I also know what people value.... But for those who dont? #do-and-learn?


[04-Aug-24 03:56 PM] jcheung#0000
That could be a column of its own


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No; but giving ratios for delivery locations would be nice.


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] jvaler#0000
ratios for delivery locations? what's that mean


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] jcheung#0000
Ticker / stock / location
RAT /2038 / ANT, HRT

If you have distributed production....


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Some at Mor, Some at Hrt... The most at ANT... IDK what you do üòõ


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I'd be minded to keep it simple... material, stock, location, user, price. This replicates what we have now.


[04-Aug-24 03:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Neither will anyone else, unless they have your FIO perms, at least.


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Then you can split location by whatever standardized separator


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] jvaler#0000
oh multiple locations? how would stock work for that? do you just sum both locations' stock into 1 number?


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
I think you push that onto the person producing the view, and have one row per location.


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Either individual line items per location, or just that it's available


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
That way the consoldated view is simple


[04-Aug-24 03:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Can if you want do, but add a column for disclaimer, with different CXs as variable cards.


[04-Aug-24 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
I may have imagined just a condensed list when i wrote this specifically


[04-Aug-24 04:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Consolidated is simpler for FIO. Diverse is simpler for client realities. 1st is easier to simply implement, just add wildcards when you know it's not like 100% ANT


[04-Aug-24 04:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Idc, what you do, btw.


[04-Aug-24 04:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A simple mockup first.


[04-Aug-24 04:01 PM] jvaler#0000
that makes the most sense, but it also sounds really difficult with how some of the functions i'm relying on work


[04-Aug-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
.....a mock up would be more effort that it's worth


[04-Aug-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
What's the fio output data that you get, i haven't messed with the API outputs yet


[04-Aug-24 04:02 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm in the middle of repurposing the personal sheet i made into a template, so i'll have something to show soon

It's merely something that you can throw in front of someone, and say, this is what's i'm offering as my FIO store!

[04-Aug-24 04:05 PM] jcheung#0000
No, they're literally building the product which is shifting each time they make a change. Any "mock up" would require functional formulas and be no different from the final version


[04-Aug-24 04:09 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I get that... But they're dropping FIO input functions, pulling API data, which looks like you could filter out what you're not willing to sell to others... Minimally viable product (you just just drop in a note, saying what is not for sale, and post that AS-IS).


[04-Aug-24 04:09 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah it's like 50% functional right now


[04-Aug-24 04:09 PM] jvaler#0000
a lot of it is already made and/or can be repurposed


[04-Aug-24 04:09 PM] jcheung#0000
Cool. Then you can filter each cx by default and then have a line for each item with location tag?
Maybe also an area for limited entries, maybe.... 5 non cx locations and 2 tickers at each location?


[04-Aug-24 04:10 PM] jvaler#0000
can't quite picture this in my head lol sorry


[04-Aug-24 04:10 PM] jcheung#0000
Let me get thome


[04-Aug-24 04:10 PM] jvaler#0000
alr


[04-Aug-24 04:12 PM] jvaler#0000
if we were to do custom locations i was thinking i could import the FIO .csv that lists every planet in the game, then just turn that into a dropdown you can search and select from

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Aug-24 04:12 PM] jvaler#0000
so that solves specifying what are valid inputs, but there's still the issue of how to process that into something functional


[04-Aug-24 04:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Functional? Maybe. What do you want to be displayed?


[04-Aug-24 04:18 PM] jvaler#0000
i imagine this? so you'd have 1 row per location that way you can specify a different stock and buffer in each location


[04-Aug-24 04:20 PM] jvaler#0000
it'd be very easy to *replace* the ANT default location with another location, but it will be difficult to be able to make listings *in addition* to the ANT default location


[04-Aug-24 04:21 PM] tanda#0000
most of the time goods will be sold at the point they are produce or as side deals


[04-Aug-24 04:22 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not sure the sheet would necessarily need to cover those cases


[04-Aug-24 04:23 PM] jvaler#0000
sold at the point they are produced? as in on-site? i feel like those cases are actually much less common than stuff being traded at ANT


[04-Aug-24 04:23 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, that's what I mean. Sometimes I'll sell some LST to someone who needs some or someone will pick up AL at Deimos


[04-Aug-24 04:24 PM] tanda#0000
but those are generally with repeat partners or people who ask for one time deals


[04-Aug-24 04:24 PM] tanda#0000
95% of the time if I'm looking through the trade channel I'm expecting ANT pickup


[04-Aug-24 04:24 PM] jvaler#0000
ah okay


[04-Aug-24 04:24 PM] tanda#0000
That and as a proof of concept, the smaller scope the better


[04-Aug-24 04:25 PM] tanda#0000
other things could be added in later


[04-Aug-24 04:25 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's a fair argument


[04-Aug-24 04:25 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i'm thinking the effort needed to be able to list multiple locations isn't worth how little it would be utilized


[04-Aug-24 04:25 PM] akyantor#0000
95% of the ADI internal trade is at CX, so perhaps don't complicate it for the first iteration


[04-Aug-24 04:25 PM] jvaler#0000
buut i could run a poll


[04-Aug-24 04:27 PM] jvaler#0000
for something to show sure, but once it's implemented we'd want to keep template revisions to a minimum. cause each person would have to create a copy of the new template and fill out their information again


[04-Aug-24 04:28 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah, fair point


[04-Aug-24 04:28 PM] tanda#0000
default FIO import data imports all items in all locations for everyone, so maybe just keep that, and then just filter down to ANT until you can find a way to implement it on the master side?


[04-Aug-24 04:29 PM] realharvey#0000
maybe make a template that holds way more information than we are displaying in the first iteration?

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[04-Aug-24 04:29 PM] realharvey#0000
So if we decide we want to display some more information


[04-Aug-24 04:29 PM] realharvey#0000
the template is already there


[04-Aug-24 04:29 PM] realharvey#0000
and you just fill some more fields


[04-Aug-24 04:29 PM] realharvey#0000
or you just fill it full beforehand


[04-Aug-24 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that may work. Consolodated view just filters to ANT only to start...


[04-Aug-24 04:32 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't think the issue is actually on the compiled side, it's on the template side. because currently i have each listing specified based on a checklist next to every single ticker. so you checkmark what items you're selling and it adds a single entry of that to the "offered tickers" column.

to be able to have multiple locations would require duplicate rows of tickers, which i have no idea where to begin to do that

It's a compliment. Yes you, do stand for whatever includes you! Lest not something of yours, actually come due? Idk. The person who wanted full, individual automation, now stands aback, against another's temptation! 

Find out a common cause and effort, of any who want, in this befitting desert.

**My long previous argument of inclusion of ther #programmers, who want to contribute to this, still stands** Find a common solution, both of ye, so that many can rejoice, in bountiful glee!

[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Like per automated // collated private-stock listings "But I won't have anything to do then!?!?" If you like it, go with it. If not, then say what you'd like, to keep you in the game.


[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Alright, i have to ask. Are you a manager type? You seem like that manager type who ate a thesaurus and gets physically ill if they use words containing less than 5 letters and constantly needs tl know everything instead of letting people work in peace

You want high, all the time? Just talk with #Joe_Biden, in APEX general chat in-game.

I don't do those drugs, at any time though.


[04-Aug-24 05:18 PM] jvaler#0000
the contention is that not everything needs a different perspective. 

for example in #associate-planning, pointing out that you'd need an FTL-capable ship to use demeter is pointless because that's the case for basically every planet in the game. hell, demeter doesn't even have a shipyard to make STL-only ships possible.


[04-Aug-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
it completely derails the conversation


[04-Aug-24 05:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Demeter -- Hermes, is an off-CX system, that needs pure FTL comittment. There's a few others, that don't need such service, all the time.


[04-Aug-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
what does off-CX mean?


[04-Aug-24 05:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, you'll wan't some FTL service, eventually, but it depends on the STO/WAR investment put into each base, by each person -------- off-CX = everything in a system, that doesn't have a CX.


[04-Aug-24 05:20 PM] jvaler#0000
so off-CX = 99% of planets?

[04-Aug-24 05:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It depends on what you need supplied immediately, every few days, or it can just grind by itself. I'll note 2 systems. FK-794 + SE-110. They have inherent RE/AGR/FP COGCs, with chains that can be easily serviced with STLs, provided FTL exports, at some point in time, depending on when you need those exports done.


[04-Aug-24 05:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Your example, now?


[04-Aug-24 05:24 PM] jvaler#0000
you said everything that isn't in the CX system is an off-CX planet...


[04-Aug-24 05:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

If you don't like a given talk, I'll cut-off, at request, with no harm done, beef, or ill issue, on my end.

Convince me, on specific issues, with evidence, reason, and whatever you like.... I'f I'm inclined = you'll get full support from me.


[04-Aug-24 05:30 PM] evany.#0000
its not their job to convince you, not everyones looking for a debate. as someone that enjoys a healthy debate from time to time its just not that important most of the time if you decide to drop a single AML off-cogc.


[04-Aug-24 05:32 PM] jcheung#0000
are CXs even on planets? thought they were on stations orbiting the star


[04-Aug-24 05:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, I get it. My point, is that even small debates, can give out little ideas... Like your AML off-cogc... You don't have to try to convince me either! I'm perfectly fine with you having the better idea --- I might even swtich my operations to suit that idea!


[04-Aug-24 05:33 PM] jvaler#0000
that's correct


[04-Aug-24 05:33 PM] jcheung#0000
therefore, all planets are off-cx üòâ


[04-Aug-24 05:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Set, by the few people that actually vote for COGC application --- YES!


[04-Aug-24 05:34 PM] jvaler#0000
huh? CX =/= CoGC


[04-Aug-24 05:34 PM] jcheung#0000
what the actual... hell does COGC have to do with CX


[04-Aug-24 05:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not argument... Little observation though... freudian slip!?


[04-Aug-24 05:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Most CX operational areas have diversified operations, to include enough COGC applications, per planet, within decent reach of a given CX?


[04-Aug-24 05:35 PM] jcheung#0000
i think you've lost the plot


[04-Aug-24 05:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It would be nice if CX == COGC influence, but right now, it doesn't... Per the point... Almost all planets are Off-CX, unless you can guarantee service?!


[04-Aug-24 05:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^^ Is that good enough?


[04-Aug-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
what point


[04-Aug-24 05:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
this one


[04-Aug-24 05:38 PM] jcheung#0000
there are zero CoGCs influenced by CX, and zero CXs affected by CoGCs.
additionally, to what you just quoted, let me break that down for you.
CXs are physically distinct entities from planets. they have zero relation to planets other than being physical entities orbiting a stellar furnace.


[04-Aug-24 05:38 PM] jcheung#0000
it would be like calling the international space station a moon


[04-Aug-24 05:39 PM] jcheung#0000
therefore, since they are distinct entities not physically coupled, all planets are off CX, and all CXs are off planet


[04-Aug-24 05:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Extremely fair, however consider those companies, operating majorly, within a given CX, have matching faction bonuses, which is concurrent with their faction's designation. BEN companies, have a flat production bonus, to MAN COGCs + base production, which is irrelevant of what any of those companies actually do. Per your point, the COGCs might not be directly influenced by the CX, but statistically, those additional bonuses should convey some sort of opportunity cost preference, regarding those processes which people would better like to run + what's available in the given area, around BEN, compared to others.


[04-Aug-24 05:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This is also extremely general.


[04-Aug-24 05:43 PM] jcheung#0000
first of all, those are not COGCs


[04-Aug-24 05:43 PM] jcheung#0000
actually, that's the only thing that has to be said


[04-Aug-24 05:44 PM] jcheung#0000
well, i guess i can add


[04-Aug-24 05:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No, but their input price points are influenced by the efficiencies not only inherent via faction bonuses, but also those seen via CX price spreads, and nearby resource deposits.


[04-Aug-24 05:44 PM] jcheung#0000
second, faction bonuses apply across the entire galaxy


[04-Aug-24 05:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you are all over across the galaxy.


[04-Aug-24 05:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Otherwise, starter bros only really have Faction + non-faction areas, directly available to them, via accessible shipping, with their limitations.

how i finally finished it was i attached the contract to my base screen and had it nearly fill up the inventory panel

[05-Aug-24 01:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It bounces into a different topic. People have free will in what/whom they choose to engage with. Maybe Hal would have a better idea as to why it happened? I'm staying impartial, even --- even if it's an extremely touchy subject. If I was in australis's shoes, I would have loved to expressly stated any concerns, against any others around prun, should I have had them. Else, I would have given a short sentence as to why I am leaving. Few do that, and I don't blame them. But I don't blame him for not doing so.


[05-Aug-24 01:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Keep up with the contention, though, on whatever I type. You have my full consent. The purpose of competition, should be to arrive at a better method/solution to any problem at hand, and I have no problem with it. üòÑ


[05-Aug-24 01:27 PM] igfloz#0000
I'll apologise right at the start of this, cos I thnk this might come across as me personally attacking you - but your like Tigger on acid, bouncing into any and every thing with an opinionated and sometimes I feel, devisive input. Who knows, maybe astra just left because he didn't want to put up with such discord ? - I know I have hovered over the block button a few times

@scintillating_iridescence a considerable number of members have expressed that they find the constant arguments started by you make the server unpleasant to talk in.

i'm asking you to please tone down the level of argumentative counterpoints being brought up at every opportunity. not everything needs to be a debate. 

i'm not going to take any other action yet as i'd like to give you a chance to behave better.

K. I'll still offer my responses, but if I notice things start to get rolling down a chain of argument, immediately after, I won't add anything more. Is that fair?


[05-Aug-24 01:50 PM] jvaler#0000
there's no need to start most of the arguments in the first place. so many of these are just debates for the sake of debate. the original responses brought up are usually based in semantics and hypotheticals ungrounded from reality, which are frustrating and not constructive.

before responding, ask yourself "is this relevant?" and "is this constructive?"

[05-Aug-24 01:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Duly noted. I'll let others do the pitching in, and if I find something that's missing, from a discussion on relevant Prun things, I'll pitch in, only afterwards, in a limited setting, with a guarantee that you'll get no further argument from me.

[05-Aug-24 06:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Profits are a thing. Uhm. ROIs of capital investment, versus expected returns, on a base are also a thing.


[05-Aug-24 06:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lower POPI tech production, like rats/dw offer good ROIs, but they're determined by your capital sinks in the bases. Higher tech production, basic example: EDC/IDC, offer better capital sinks, which turn over a greater # of money in game, but at a lesser sales turnover + marginal gain.


[05-Aug-24 06:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

I wouldn't worry. As long as you end the week with more assets than in the beginning you will be fine


[05-Aug-24 06:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmmm. Fuel use is just a small percentage of your activity. If you always burn least, it's no issue.


[05-Aug-24 06:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Eh, you look fine. Private projects get accounted in very different ways from what the in-game accouting system is meant for. In-game accounting deals with pure CX-sales, minues CX-purchases, that were plugged into production ques. If you deal a lot with private project stuff, your in-game accounting won't look right.


[05-Aug-24 06:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lots of null cost item transfers, that get plugged into production costs as null values, that eventually get sold at the CX, at a huge profit? Idk.

I saw suggestions to do Manufacturing on Hephaestus. Having just COLIQ, do I just fly to Hephaestus and then create base or is it recommended to start on Phobos first and *later* move over?


[07-Aug-24 12:18 PM] evany.#0000
if your going to do manufacturing i'd encourage you to start on deimos


[07-Aug-24 12:19 PM] evany.#0000
then get your grant and drop on say heph or nascent or something along those lines.


[07-Aug-24 12:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A Demios start is preffered --- not that it's better, just that any open space for your plot, is running out. (It's been at current #s for like a few months, but it could easily disappear at any time). Same goes for Harmonia.


[07-Aug-24 12:20 PM] evany.#0000
i'd argue it is better, but opportunity is the same


[07-Aug-24 12:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I argue the plot #s will get filled out soon..... Since Joshua just Coliq'd, well we could just drop in an easy grant for an additional permit, and get him on Harmonia, if he'll be in ANT, long term?


[07-Aug-24 12:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Deimos is filled.


[07-Aug-24 12:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
but not if you're still in the starter screen.


[07-Aug-24 12:23 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
Im still in the starter screen üôÇ


[07-Aug-24 12:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And Harmonia is like at 15 open plots, so you have like a month?


[07-Aug-24 12:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hephaestus isn't close to getting filled. Manufacturing options in ANT space are rather open, but should you eventually like to diversify, you may lose that opportunity in say ~1 month? Just so that it's out there.


[07-Aug-24 12:25 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
Sounds like a plan, then. I'll run a few errands and then start base on Deimos.

[07-Aug-24 12:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, I'll be doing a product trial, for dope/stupid levels of increased RAT/DW/COF production, to be exported into ANT, with 1-4 weeks. For those who would be interested in running such a thing, poke me in-game. I can give you metrics on the weekend, and a user experience, within like a month, when I start. There is a warning.... it's #expensive.

But also, if you are COLIQ ing, restart on promitor or Deimos

^ If that one will thoroughly stay, would I ask a little grant, if I may? Get him on Harmonia, if he will do.

This of course needs some negotiation, and discussion. ~15 Harm plots are still open to all, lest not some hopefuls be brought to a stall.


[07-Aug-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Point being, you have ~15 players to drop on Harm, after they drop on Deimos. After which, you will only be able to convince a COLIQ to drop on only either.


[07-Aug-24 01:38 PM] tanda#0000

[07-Aug-24 01:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm not going to argue with anyone, but i've done forward-forecasts, and these thing are hard maths. IF you don't negotiate with the new people, to contribute to Harmonia, at whatever is negotiated,... welll someone else will.


[07-Aug-24 01:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And since Deimos is beyond entry, for anyone who hasn't dropped their starter plot there, Harmonia is simply next in line.


[07-Aug-24 01:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
<-- Was very lucky to get on Promitor, and Deimos, and Harmonia... This things just disappear, with universe age x player count.

[09-Aug-24 04:54 PM] igfloz#0000
I had to google, lol -  black printer ink is No.9 on the list of expensive fluids


[09-Aug-24 04:59 PM] jcheung#0000

Mmm, black printer ink... That sounds like a complete oligopoly, with DRM-imposed market, and consumer controls -- aka artificial scarcity. Lets see. Other things are limited via patent/monopoly production. And the few other things are literally limited, due to pure production limits, like the horseshoe crab blood, and the venom.


[09-Aug-24 05:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I feel for the horseshoe crabs though. They're caught, and then brought into collection labs, to be only strapped in, with IV lines stuck into their bodies, for continuous collection. The scene is pretty much something out of that Daybreakers film, which came out some while ago.


[09-Aug-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
i feel bad for them


[09-Aug-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
but they save so many lives


[09-Aug-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
....now insulin, that makes me mad


[09-Aug-24 06:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah; I think some not-for-profit startup lab, was wanting to re-engineer a generic insulin (since well you know, the chemical process notes kinda disappear along the way), some time ago. I haven't heard anything from it, so I'm guessing they got stomped on, through legals means, or through not getting any funding.


[09-Aug-24 06:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's also sort-of a Catch-22.... De-profit, a profitable industry (patented insulin manufacturing processes + sales/distribution), and you'll be cutting into the pension/retirement funds, that many, many public sector + well-to-do private sector employees are invested in. An alternative is needed, in that regard.


[09-Aug-24 06:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or not. But trying to fight/change some sort of social/financial relationship, that has been established for decades, including the amount of investment that many have hanging on potential outcomes, is a lost battle on paper.

long term obs to build ships but need to build Food supply i think next

my only base i have


[17-Aug-24 03:12 PM] tanda#0000
okay, ALO is a pretty safe starter bet, but have you run the numbers on having just enough EXT to feed a planet full of SME?


[17-Aug-24 03:12 PM] xtc69#0000
would it be worth to build more permits


[17-Aug-24 03:12 PM] xtc69#0000

[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] tanda#0000
early HQ levels are pretty cheap, but also they only get you half the space as a new planet


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] xtc69#0000
was thinking on building new HQ on different planted next might be best investment long term


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] tanda#0000
a very common early step for people to take is building out Deimos and then securing their carbon production by settling Harmonia and Nascent


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] xtc69#0000
but i only have 700k


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] xtc69#0000

speaking personally, from my past experiences, I would minimize the number of EXT I had


[17-Aug-24 03:18 PM] xtc69#0000
guessing the ALO long term is bad

and ALO is better sourced from Nascent than Deimos


[17-Aug-24 03:19 PM] tanda#0000
don't get me wrong, Harmonia is dead simple to keep supplied, but it's still going to tie up a ship for one day out of 5


[17-Aug-24 03:19 PM] xtc69#0000
how much are ships atm ?


[17-Aug-24 03:19 PM] tanda#0000
4.4-6m for a usable ship

you need to create the shipping issues before you solve them


[17-Aug-24 03:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would say you can burn a bit more fuel before you need to make an upgrade


[17-Aug-24 03:22 PM] marat_sh#0000

[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] xtc69#0000

[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] xtc69#0000
aww okay i see


[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] xtc69#0000
seems like one ship just seats and does nothing atm


[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] tanda#0000
AL is easier to ship than ALO. It's why I recommend keeping the number of EXTs you have to a minimum


[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] xtc69#0000
yeah i forgot about the weight issue


[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] tanda#0000
then when you get your Nascent base, you can put them there to feed your Deimos base

I do 1) **FLT + LMOS** on the first; 2) **CXOS + CONTS** on the second; 3) **FIN + FINLA + FINBS + FINIS + FXOS** on the third/fourth. You can have your WF burn inventories on any other ones, but I usually include them on my base screens, and idk if you'll be able to fit everything on what you've got going --- those are best done in-game imo.

There's also APEX mobile, that you can buffer on your phone, but you'll have to set it up, since it's a different instance from what you've got going on the browser. Useful for some things, like the WR workforce inventories/burn, but for others it's just tiresome.

Deimos has 0 available plots, so if you wanna start fresh it's nice to have a base on that planet for future

i suspect AL refining will die down a little here soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è


[19-Aug-24 01:51 PM] flor2081#0000
its actually really good to start on promitor and expand into antares


[19-Aug-24 01:54 PM] flor2081#0000
its considered the best starting planet


[19-Aug-24 02:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
base outside of Antares? Heresy


[19-Aug-24 02:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
jokes aside... Yeah promitor is an amazing planet


[19-Aug-24 02:02 PM] flor2081#0000
you'd be moving into antares after starting on prom, so that'd be even better because you're betraying IC


[19-Aug-24 02:02 PM] flor2081#0000
..does that convince y'all antares lovers? üòÑ


[19-Aug-24 02:03 PM] igfloz#0000
3 cheers for betrayal !! hip hip ?


[19-Aug-24 02:05 PM] ohs_#0000
Might try this out


[19-Aug-24 02:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am not a metallurgist so you might want to ask some people around here some advice


[19-Aug-24 02:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
Like EXT to SME ratio


[19-Aug-24 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will run some math at some point, but I'd be surprised if Prom was really that great. I mean if you're gonna run an all FRM planet, it's the best of those... but I don't think that means it's automatically your best first planet


[19-Aug-24 02:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ Not really amazing for starting but in general very good planet


[19-Aug-24 02:08 PM] flor2081#0000
i mean, if you're doing farming/FP it's the best out of all starter planets


[19-Aug-24 02:08 PM] flor2081#0000
like higher ferility than harmonia for example, and its really close to the cx


[19-Aug-24 02:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
any future plans on expanding plots on planets in the future?


[19-Aug-24 02:23 PM] realharvey#0000
Prom Avalon and Helion. Super good planet combo for a farming start. Right next to the CX. Pretty much unbeatable


[19-Aug-24 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
quick question


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
slow answer


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] laaxus#0000
is coffee and pwo worth it ?


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
usually, yes


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
when first starting out though, it's hard to say


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not just usually always


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
well, i say usually because of cashflow constraints


[19-Aug-24 03:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Even when starting out


[19-Aug-24 03:22 PM] laaxus#0000
so I must always make sure that my workers have everything and never runs out


[19-Aug-24 03:22 PM] laaxus#0000
ok


[19-Aug-24 03:22 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah there's 2 sides to that, but basically: always worth it unless you're reaaly trying to minmax


[19-Aug-24 03:22 PM] flor2081#0000
always just go for the highest efficiency, so following the CoGC, max experts, etc


[19-Aug-24 03:22 PM] laaxus#0000
trying too hard to minmax does not last
Most efficient while being lazy is the way to go


[19-Aug-24 03:23 PM] razenpok#0000
Wait, for minmaxing it's also always worth it


[19-Aug-24 03:23 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah you can argue that the money you use to buy the COF/PWO can be put into building more buildings earlier


[19-Aug-24 03:23 PM] flor2081#0000
but its kinda difficult to really prove that with numbers


[19-Aug-24 03:23 PM] jcheung#0000
imo it's worth it unless you just simply don't have the funds to stock it.... plus it's not worth it to me to make a CX run for one consumable if my ship will be nearly empty for both legs


[19-Aug-24 03:23 PM] jcheung#0000
but if you have to choose between consumables and feeding your factories, feedstock 100% is a better choice


[19-Aug-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
feedstock plus rat and dw are bare minimums


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] razenpok#0000
Well, not buying lux goods in the beginning means you will be able to buy more stuff to stock up your base => less ship travels


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] jcheung#0000
that's what i was trying to get at


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] razenpok#0000
Ye


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] flor2081#0000
but you can also buy building mats earlier and thus grow quicker


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] jcheung#0000
financially constrained at the start


[19-Aug-24 03:25 PM] flor2081#0000
which is the argument i meant


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But you‚Äôll make more money bc you‚Äôll be more efficient


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
but i'm not a fan of that, just buy cof and pwo üòÑ


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] jcheung#0000
that's debatable


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
new building is better than that 20%, or so i've been told, i havent seen anyone that actually did the numbers


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
lemme see if i can find earlier arguments of this


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] razenpok#0000
But you'll need to make more trips to cx and spend money on fuel


[19-Aug-24 03:26 PM] jcheung#0000
you'll be forced to run ships at lower fill to CX because if you don't, you won't have feedstock


[19-Aug-24 03:27 PM] razenpok#0000

[19-Aug-24 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
this is the first question I asked myself after watching the third tutorial video


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] razenpok#0000
It's basically a couple first weeks in the game when it matters


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
because each situation is different, and differing market conditions for fuel change the calculations


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] realharvey#0000
its complicated because you have to factor a lot of stuff into it. Flight times, convinience etc.


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] laaxus#0000
true


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well imo you‚Äôre probably gonna get a grant so money doesn‚Äôt really become a problem


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] laaxus#0000
i'll change the topic


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] realharvey#0000
and no one is really deep enough in the early game to figure it out


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
variables include, but are not limited to, cost of fuel, cost of feedstock, cost of consumables, cash on hand, distance to CX


[19-Aug-24 03:28 PM] laaxus#0000
how does efficiency work ? They produce faster or they produce more ?


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] realharvey#0000
and after early game you always get all luxury consumables anyway.


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] jcheung#0000
faster


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] realharvey#0000
Thats probably why no one did the math


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] laaxus#0000
then it's definitly not worth it


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] laaxus#0000
until the ship is full

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] laaxus#0000
imo


[19-Aug-24 03:29 PM] jcheung#0000
maybe not *full* but at least 40% utilization imo


[19-Aug-24 03:30 PM] razenpok#0000
And I think it was *maybe* also relevant in the early days of the universe


[19-Aug-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
well usually people do the math, others point out that the math is wrong, everyone gets mad and everyone gives up üòÑ


[19-Aug-24 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
also if you jam the sliders far to the left you can be more fuel efficient, but slower. if you need to go even slower, take some gas out of your tank


[19-Aug-24 03:30 PM] realharvey#0000
I wouldnt go with full or not full. Just like once every 7 days head to the CX at min speed and buy some new buldings and consumables

oh, wait the fuel in the ship increase weight ?


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] jcheung#0000
no


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] laaxus#0000
is it significant ?


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] laaxus#0000
ok


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] razenpok#0000
yes


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] razenpok#0000
no


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] razenpok#0000
Ship itself weighs a lot


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] jcheung#0000
the engine in a starter is powerful enough that a full ship isn't limited by weight


[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] realharvey#0000
its a rounding error at most

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[19-Aug-24 03:31 PM] jcheung#0000
but the travel slider is based on how much fuel you have in the tank


[19-Aug-24 03:32 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have 100 units of fuel, STL slider far right is 100 units, far left is minimum it will let you...


[19-Aug-24 03:32 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have 1000 units, far right is 1000 units


[19-Aug-24 03:32 PM] razenpok#0000
Yes, that's correct


[19-Aug-24 03:32 PM] jcheung#0000
but far left will be higher than the minimums at 100


[19-Aug-24 03:33 PM] realharvey#0000
TLDR: just tank you ship full and put the slider to minimum

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[19-Aug-24 03:33 PM] jcheung#0000
well


[19-Aug-24 03:34 PM] jcheung#0000
what i'm trying to say is if it arrives at 4AM and you wake up at 8AM you can take some fuel out and arrive at 7:30


[19-Aug-24 03:34 PM] razenpok#0000
Or two or three (or four even) ticks away from the minimum. It will slice travel time by a lot, while not adding much to fuel consumption


[19-Aug-24 03:35 PM] realharvey#0000
while this is true. At the beginnung you have 2 idle ships. So just run them on absolute minimum


[19-Aug-24 03:35 PM] razenpok#0000
Fair


[19-Aug-24 03:35 PM] razenpok#0000
~~slower flight means more ship damage and repair costs~~


[19-Aug-24 03:36 PM] laaxus#0000
absolute minimum seems also to increase dmg

another thing you can do, which may come back to bite you

looking at my flleet: I havent repaired anything yet. lol


[19-Aug-24 03:36 PM] jcheung#0000
you can sell some of the fuel you get from the tutorial contracts


[19-Aug-24 03:37 PM] jcheung#0000
SF and FF are pegged basically to max

I don't want to wait 3 days for one trip


[19-Aug-24 03:39 PM] jcheung#0000
note that sometimes using more fuel is less efficient


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] realharvey#0000
there is also usually 2 ways the ship can fly. You could get 2 different results with the same fuel slider setting


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] laaxus#0000
yes, no point for the ship to spend fuel if it goes faster than the production


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] jcheung#0000
sometimes i'll add a tick or two and the time will increase 4 hours instead of going down


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] jcheung#0000
not what i'm talking about, but that's another good point


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] laaxus#0000
ideally, the ship should be moving constantly


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] laaxus#0000
at the rythm of production


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] realharvey#0000
no it should not. At the beginning you would be wasting fuel with this way of thinking


[19-Aug-24 03:40 PM] laaxus#0000
basically doing jit


[19-Aug-24 03:41 PM] realharvey#0000
ah okay with this yes


[19-Aug-24 03:41 PM] tanda#0000
Ideally for the ship, but not for you. Even later you don't want that level of micromanagement


[19-Aug-24 03:41 PM] laaxus#0000
it's not like I have many things to do


[19-Aug-24 03:42 PM] flor2081#0000
i have 15 ships, 4 of those are moving (:


[19-Aug-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
basically if you open your system map while doing STL planning you see the ship track. it'll look something like...

if you tick up enough, it may flip to the other side of the star

[19-Aug-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
when if flips, it'll add some time to your travel


[19-Aug-24 03:43 PM] laaxus#0000
just checked, the fuel weight 100T when full


[19-Aug-24 03:43 PM] realharvey#0000
this can maybe change a travel from 24hours + to 8 hours in some cases lol


[19-Aug-24 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
then, what harvey mentions here, if you just click the slider repeatedly without moving it anywhere, eventually you'll see two different times... STL it's usually not worth it, because the fuel cost also goes up a bunch, but FTL this can cut hours off your travel for 1-20 units more fuel


[19-Aug-24 03:44 PM] laaxus#0000
so the fuel is between 7% and 11% of the total weight, depending on cargo


[19-Aug-24 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
don't worry about fuel weight in a starter ship


[19-Aug-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000
the engines don't care about load % in a starter-they're G limited


[19-Aug-24 03:45 PM] realharvey#0000
don't worry about fuel weight ~~in a starter ship~~

What kind of production is lacking in the current antares market ?


[19-Aug-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
RATs?


[19-Aug-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
i think AL is slowly coming down


[19-Aug-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
MCG is still pretty okay


[19-Aug-24 03:52 PM] jcheung#0000
C.... hmmm


[19-Aug-24 03:52 PM] jcheung#0000
C is still pretty high


[19-Aug-24 03:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[19-Aug-24 03:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[19-Aug-24 03:52 PM] marat_sh#0000

Oh I was not planning to adapt for now


[19-Aug-24 03:53 PM] laaxus#0000
was just wondering


[19-Aug-24 03:53 PM] laaxus#0000
usually, when something is not produced enough to meet market demand, it's because there's a reason


[19-Aug-24 03:53 PM] laaxus#0000
and that would have been interesting


[19-Aug-24 03:53 PM] realharvey#0000
You make me mad. But I like you. So I try to live with it


[19-Aug-24 03:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I think whatever you are capable of producing right now is being produced in adequate quantities


[19-Aug-24 03:54 PM] jcheung#0000
lately i think it's been because people have been chasing other profitable things and ignoring staples


[19-Aug-24 03:54 PM] flor2081#0000
i dont have enough ships so I bought the bottom 2 a couple of days ago, and i've got another one ready to be built right now


[19-Aug-24 03:54 PM] jcheung#0000
which means once stockpiles run out people start buying things up


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
which is why :RAT: is rocketing up


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] laaxus#0000
Ok another question, how does the game handle the infinite inflation issue ?


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] realharvey#0000
so you made my ships with rise take so long


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] laaxus#0000
what are the money sinks


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] flor2081#0000
no i bought in gtu, slightly cheaper than rise, and faster (:


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
planets


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] laaxus#0000
outside of fuel consumptions


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
planets need upkeep


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] realharvey#0000
ah the guy with extreme long queue times?


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
it's not enough to fully control inflation though


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
when there are literal money printers


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] razenpok#0000
Ooh, that's a great question


[19-Aug-24 03:55 PM] flor2081#0000
nono, gtu has a shipbuilding team aswell


[19-Aug-24 03:56 PM] flor2081#0000
lemme find it


[19-Aug-24 03:56 PM] razenpok#0000
Pop upkeep, fuel consumption, repairs, etc. are *not* a money sink

[19-Aug-24 03:56 PM] razenpok#0000
They are a resource sink, since the amount of money doesn't change in the system


[19-Aug-24 03:56 PM] laaxus#0000
Following this chart, it seems like the prices are going up, which seems surprising when economies and industries are developing

[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] razenpok#0000
Market makers are the money sink


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] flor2081#0000
no


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] flor2081#0000
HQ are the more sinks


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] flor2081#0000
market makers are the opposite, they give more money than they take away, i believe (look at IDC/EDC)


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] razenpok#0000
Also no


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] jcheung#0000
this directly contributes to money not entering the system


[19-Aug-24 03:57 PM] razenpok#0000
HQs are a resource sink as well


[19-Aug-24 03:58 PM] jcheung#0000
resource sinks ARE money sinks

Okay, for the meme bingo we need a "what I make myself is free" conversation


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] laaxus#0000
imagine the following scenario :
I create a new account
I buy ressources on the market
I give it to the planet

The planet absorbed ressources, but the amount of money in the economy increased


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah i guess you're right


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
but


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
MM's are no money sink either


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
well, not in total anyways


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
now, trace the material back to the source


[19-Aug-24 03:59 PM] flor2081#0000
they inject way more than they take away, with IDC/EDC


[19-Aug-24 04:00 PM] jcheung#0000
at each production stage, you lose fuel for transport, taxes, workforce consumables

Here, I also had this exact question and got an answer


[19-Aug-24 04:00 PM] jcheung#0000
granted the taxes is lateral movement


[19-Aug-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways. to control inflation all the devs have to do is just tweak the MMs of the money printers


[19-Aug-24 04:02 PM] laaxus#0000
thanks


[19-Aug-24 04:02 PM] realharvey#0000
we get regular economic reports. Currently there is no real inflation hitting us


[19-Aug-24 04:02 PM] realharvey#0000
there is also a lot of money disappearing with people quitting


[19-Aug-24 04:03 PM] razenpok#0000
Interestingly, the money supply in the game is relatively stable


[19-Aug-24 04:03 PM] laaxus#0000
What would explain this curve ? Player activity ?


[19-Aug-24 04:03 PM] jcheung#0000
oh, also FX trades also sinks a little money

concern 

[19-Aug-24 04:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Another sink is big players improving their HQ. At level 25+ a single HQ lvl is the output of many many small players


[19-Aug-24 04:05 PM] flor2081#0000
level 60 is absolutely insane


[19-Aug-24 04:06 PM] flor2081#0000
apparently thats not a money sink but a resource sink

[19-Aug-24 04:06 PM] realharvey#0000
whatever prun is doing. The amount of currency apparently stays the same. So no marketmaker or money printers really have a bad influence on inflation


[19-Aug-24 04:07 PM] laaxus#0000
Last question before I go to sleep, what drives this curve ? player activity ?


[19-Aug-24 04:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think they tweak the cost of EDC/IDC with that in mind

Also, higher end stuff is more profitable. So as players mature they consume more and more and produce less and less

200 x 31  = +6200   (MCG)
-8    x 99  = -792      (SIO)
-16   x 118 = -1888    (LST)
-70   x 16 = -1120      (SF) 
-8     x 89 = -760       (DW)
-8     x 153 =-1224    (RAT)
-1      x 128= -128      (OVE)

Total = 288

Am i missing something ?


[20-Aug-24 02:18 AM] jcheung#0000
Eesh. That's a small quantity to ship


[20-Aug-24 02:18 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah I know but I can't create SIO and LST out of thin air


[20-Aug-24 02:19 AM] jcheung#0000
Uhm. Wonder if we can arrange for some cheaper LST for you....


[20-Aug-24 02:19 AM] jcheung#0000
Technically you can, or at least with inputs of rat and dw, but that needs another base üòπ


[20-Aug-24 02:20 AM] laaxus#0000
I do have H and C,  so maybe I should spend them to create PE


[20-Aug-24 02:20 AM] jcheung#0000
If i didn't just climb up into bed, i would funnel you some funds to reduce that SF cost üò¨


[20-Aug-24 02:20 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok, I have an idea


[20-Aug-24 02:20 AM] laaxus#0000
Im gonna sell my fuel


[20-Aug-24 02:20 AM] laaxus#0000
I have a whole ship doing nothing


[20-Aug-24 02:21 AM] jcheung#0000
~~hey, i mentioned that last night~~


[20-Aug-24 02:21 AM] laaxus#0000
So i'm gonna sell one ship worth of fuel,  this should give me enough capital to reduce that fuel cost


[20-Aug-24 02:21 AM] jcheung#0000
If you have time to wait, list it for 15.9


[20-Aug-24 02:21 AM] laaxus#0000
~~I do not know what you're talking about~~


[20-Aug-24 02:22 AM] jcheung#0000
Anyways


[20-Aug-24 02:23 AM] jcheung#0000
The OVE cost may not be fully spent in this batch btw


[20-Aug-24 02:23 AM] jcheung#0000
How WF consumables work is a little weird


[20-Aug-24 02:24 AM] jcheung#0000
They take a day's worth of consumption, round up and anything over one day moves the next consumption time


[20-Aug-24 02:24 AM] jcheung#0000
So one unit of OVE may actually be good for multiple days depending on consumption


[20-Aug-24 02:25 AM] jcheung#0000
....not in a good position to want to look


[20-Aug-24 02:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Did anybody do a recipe profit calculator ?


[20-Aug-24 02:32 AM] laaxus#0000
for each recipe, take the market price and output price  from the market and calculate the profit ?


[20-Aug-24 02:32 AM] laaxus#0000
Are market price accessible from an api ?


[20-Aug-24 02:32 AM] flor2081#0000
you can easily do that with prunplanner

[20-Aug-24 02:58 AM] laaxus#0000
Ok prun planner is really nice


[20-Aug-24 04:08 AM] laaxus#0000
Question :
What is the maximal size of a base on a planet ?
I see that lvl 1 base has 500 area, and that an additionnal permit give 250 more.
So I guess the maximum size is 1000 area then you are forced to do another base on another planet ?


[20-Aug-24 04:11 AM] finestone#0000
yes and it is generally considered bad to use permits in that way as permits get very expensive so new planets are a more effective use of permit "space"


[20-Aug-24 04:12 AM] finestone#0000
there is a tradeoff for shipping and fuel cost and alot of people do still run "multi-permit" bases so do what you want!


[20-Aug-24 04:13 AM] laaxus#0000
It's hard to guess which side of the trade off is good


[20-Aug-24 04:13 AM] finestone#0000
It really depends on your size and how serious you want to play the game. If you are spending alot of time and are very wealthy (Pro membership, multiple ships) and want to maximize your optimazation you should not run multi permit bases. The only exception i can think of is maybe a super high end Corp HQ.


[20-Aug-24 04:15 AM] laaxus#0000
let's imagine I produce P from B 
So B -> P

To produce B then convert it to P before selling it might be more efficient on one base

but maybe then only producing B on one base, then shipping to another base in which it's converted to P is better, considering base area limits


[20-Aug-24 04:15 AM] finestone#0000
COGC usually makes that irrel


[20-Aug-24 04:15 AM] laaxus#0000
COGC ?


[20-Aug-24 04:16 AM] finestone#0000

[20-Aug-24 04:17 AM] finestone#0000
For example your BMP base needs to be on manufactoring planet.


[20-Aug-24 04:18 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, it's advertising electronics


[20-Aug-24 04:18 AM] finestone#0000
did you start phobos


[20-Aug-24 04:18 AM] laaxus#0000
yep


[20-Aug-24 04:19 AM] finestone#0000
yeah me too. Simply put phobos is a crappy new player planet


[20-Aug-24 04:19 AM] finestone#0000
as the capital for electonics is too high


[20-Aug-24 04:19 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, it's not too late for me to delete and restart


[20-Aug-24 04:20 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't even have 24h of gameplay with the current account


[20-Aug-24 04:20 AM] laaxus#0000
if you think it's worth it


[20-Aug-24 04:20 AM] finestone#0000
There is a command for it


[20-Aug-24 04:20 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[20-Aug-24 04:21 AM] finestone#0000
I would just reccomend selling RAT's until you can up HQ and and build a new base on Antares I - Astraeus


[20-Aug-24 04:22 AM] finestone#0000
you can essentially dissemble your base on Phobos and just leave it empty for a bit it will be a good planet later. and move to all BMPs on Astraeus. then once Astraeus is full you can think of something else or fill up phobos with electronics.


[20-Aug-24 04:25 AM] finestone#0000
so that is the reason bases are usually "one dimensional" and yes sometimes shipping is a big deal but usually coordinating with a another player is a better use of both your permits than splitting the base.


[20-Aug-24 04:25 AM] finestone#0000
Hope that helps im off to bed


[20-Aug-24 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
What is convered by the manufactoring ad ?


[20-Aug-24 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
anything produced in a bmp ?


[20-Aug-24 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
I think I'll liquidate and start again on Astraeus


[20-Aug-24 04:28 AM] razenpok#0000
Huh what


[20-Aug-24 04:28 AM] finestone#0000
any building with Expertise "manufacturing"


[20-Aug-24 04:28 AM] razenpok#0000
*If* you want to liquidate and restart, do it on Hephaestus at least

Why Deimos is good ?


[20-Aug-24 04:34 AM] razenpok#0000
Why Deimos: planets have a limited number of plots, and Deimos is full currently. But new players can settle over the plot limit, so it's your best shot at getting a plot there


[20-Aug-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
and it's an important planet to have I guess ?


[20-Aug-24 04:35 AM] razenpok#0000
For example, I'm waiting until it gets down from (+37) to make a new base there (probably will never happen)

You can settle wherever tbh, so if you want something else then go for it

I literally bum rushed to Deimos, when I found out that it had like 3 open plots available.... 2 weeks later, it was closed out, forever.

This was with a similar situation at Vallis, which was almost closed out.... I picked Deimos, and now I have a base there, but I will never get on Vallis, unless I coliq.


[20-Aug-24 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
Well well well


[20-Aug-24 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
I coliq ed and realised that i can only start on deimos, phobos and harmonia


[20-Aug-24 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
and can't choose anything else apparently


[20-Aug-24 05:07 AM] laaxus#0000
Might as well start on deimos then


[20-Aug-24 05:19 AM] realharvey#0000
Best Planet anyway in Antares since you can't get a plot there anymore


[20-Aug-24 05:19 AM] phoenix09891#0000
are plots actually being freed up from people who have quit? or do those plots remain until someone destroys their own CM on the planet?


[20-Aug-24 05:26 AM] flor2081#0000
inactive accounts get deleted like once every week, which opens up some slots every time


[20-Aug-24 05:26 AM] flor2081#0000
but after a certain amount of plots over the limit, even the purging of inactive accounts wont bring it below the limit


[20-Aug-24 05:27 AM] razenpok#0000
God bless the tedium of this game that grants us mortals the free plots by purging the least patient ones


[20-Aug-24 05:27 AM] flor2081#0000
so deimos is basically lost, while harmonia will hover around the plot limit for a while

Hello there, would anyone know why Elon ( Anteras Space ), has a chemistry cogc? I think that either resource extraction or manufacturing will be a better option


[20-Aug-24 08:28 AM] chobbycock#0000
Does anyone here have a need for MLI or BAI? I started producing them and realised there isn't much of a market. So unless someone in here could use them, probably gona stop that production


[20-Aug-24 08:31 AM] realharvey#0000
because Antares needed more chemistry planets, that are reasonable close to the CX and dont have super expensive buildings MATs


[20-Aug-24 08:31 AM] realharvey#0000
The need for COGC Chemistry planets is bigger than the ressources that get extracted there


[20-Aug-24 08:32 AM] skyrey#0000
What is produced on all these chemistry planets?


[20-Aug-24 08:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
For me, I have 8 chem planets just to keep fed my PP3 production


[20-Aug-24 08:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
It‚Äôs a lot of EPO and the CL to make it


[20-Aug-24 08:38 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Mostly


[20-Aug-24 08:38 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

NS or PG are in the same range


[20-Aug-24 08:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
EPO / NS / CL / PG / TCL - are all in good demand


[20-Aug-24 08:48 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah they can all be reliably sold at the CX


[20-Aug-24 08:49 AM] skyrey#0000
I will write it down for myself


[20-Aug-24 08:51 AM] skyrey#0000
I am currently working on this idea. I have the Harmonia base built, slowly developing the Nascent base ( 7 out of 33 planed incinerators ). and I am yet to start work on the Hephaestus base. Hopefully within the next 2 months I will be done with this circle and will start looking towards other industries


[20-Aug-24 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000

You can always get loans to accelerate it. In the beginning the ROI is so good it‚Äôs easy to repay the loans


[20-Aug-24 09:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Chemistry just underpins so many industries, it's not even funny.


[20-Aug-24 09:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
For instance, no FIM/MEA or LUX consumables without DDT. No DDT without pre-processing HAL through CHPs (chem). No volume-based RAT/CAF/RCO/HCP production without NS. You'd be stuck dealing with the basic RAT/OVE recipes from just FRM outputs.


[20-Aug-24 09:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lol, no cheap DW, without the PG either. Even with the stabilized H2O prices, there're still a bit too high, if you were to make the DW via tap (the no PG recipe).


[20-Aug-24 09:55 AM] jcheung#0000
no fabs either


[20-Aug-24 09:55 AM] jcheung#0000
or few fabs


[20-Aug-24 10:35 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
B-fabs?


[20-Aug-24 10:36 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
People are likely focusing on the higher tier L/R/A fabs, and just forgetting about the liquidity sinks that the B-fab MM.ASK.AI1's are.


[20-Aug-24 10:45 AM] jcheung#0000
metal refining takes chem for better yield, so it'll spike the price on b's... and then make l/r/a impossible if chem wasn't there afaik


[20-Aug-24 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
what is the issue with bfabs production ?


[20-Aug-24 11:35 AM] jcheung#0000
similar to RATs. people looking to make better profits and overlooking them. fortunately the MM exists, or the price would be a lot higher


[20-Aug-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
ah I see


[20-Aug-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
per base, the other fabs make more money


[20-Aug-24 11:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
After a while the permits for new bases are extremely expensive


[20-Aug-24 11:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So not for a while but at some point profit per permit is very important


[20-Aug-24 11:45 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So you have a pressure to move up the tiers of products


[20-Aug-24 11:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
mmm....


[20-Aug-24 11:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

You basically have a a period of quick growth, between B and R-fabs, that tends to get cripped by the exponential costs of A-fab HQ upgrade cost sinks.... That's where I think people are seriously reconsidering their tech utilization, when they are experiencing exponential costs, per month of HQ upgrades + base installations on inhospitable worlds, and they're trying to eek out as much money as they can.

[20-Aug-24 11:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm not saying it's bad or anthing, it's just that EDC/IDC farmers have positioned themselves extremely well, 1-2 years beforehand, to benefit from the resultant supply increases of R/A-fabs + FIM/MEA, which are expected when the greater population seeks better margins, and thus competes with one another, through time.


[20-Aug-24 11:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You also have the shipbuilders, but they're marginal in terms of net volumes of those things required, per month.


[20-Aug-24 12:00 PM] laaxus#0000
From what I understand, it's better to produce A fab yourself, as you need it anyway, so you can get it for much lower than market price + make a profit from selling it ?


[20-Aug-24 12:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Maybe, up to a certain point in the universal development.... We've passed it like 6 months ago. Now A-fabs are cheaper en masse, than R-fabs, which make IDCs more profitable than EDCs.... The same situation is happening with MEA, over FIM.


[20-Aug-24 12:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Aggregate competition does wonders, to push down cost-metrics.


[20-Aug-24 12:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Especially, when most people go chasing after those Prunplanner net_profit #s. It's just things to consider.


[20-Aug-24 12:13 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

Today you can get loans and end up with 15 bases within a few months


[20-Aug-24 12:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Chem bases a have a ROI of 14-21 days


[20-Aug-24 12:16 PM] laaxus#0000
ok I understand now
Each base makes much less money than the one before


[20-Aug-24 12:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You have a situation of margin squeeze. More suppliers/competitors, which will price another out per update of CXOS orders. More peeps in-game == this sort of thing happens much faster.


[20-Aug-24 12:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Still being a returning player, game is easier to start now than a year ago

[20-Aug-24 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000
if rat prices is going up, maybe investing in a rat mass production might be a good investment long term

Glossary has anybody made one for the game..outside the list on cx markets?


[20-Aug-24 02:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's all pretty much in-game commodities, buildings, commands, trading keywords, currencies, CXes?


[20-Aug-24 02:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
if you don't find a keyword in-game, we're referring to a rl term --- just google it.

it must be so hard for a new player starting on deimos without capital


[20-Aug-24 04:01 PM] laaxus#0000
like, almost no recipe is profitable


[20-Aug-24 04:02 PM] laaxus#0000
I don't understand the metallurgy business, there's almost no trade for metallurgic end product  ?


[20-Aug-24 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Making Aluminum from ALO using Flux should be okay...?


[20-Aug-24 04:03 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[20-Aug-24 04:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's the long term goal for a full Deimos base, but the margin holds for a smaller base too


[20-Aug-24 04:05 PM] igfloz#0000
errr.... so why am I constantly transporting ALO to Deimos for others to smelt ?


[20-Aug-24 04:05 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah but I meant, for every other metallurgic building outside of sme/ext, I couldn't find one recipe worth doing ?


[20-Aug-24 04:06 PM] laaxus#0000
is deimos just a big AL factories ?


[20-Aug-24 04:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
There are other better recipies, but AL is traded very heavily. You can do better with steel, titanium, copper, lithium.


[20-Aug-24 04:07 PM] igfloz#0000
ah, I'm guessing that people might only smelt on Deimos, then transport the AL to another planet that benefits from another COGC, like construction


[20-Aug-24 04:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Are you using prunplanner for those decisions? maybe there's a setup issue there that we could help with?

[20-Aug-24 04:08 PM] laaxus#0000
it's ok, my capital will go to a pe production anyway, i was just bored and tried to think what I will do with deimos later on


[20-Aug-24 04:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I recommend Aluminum because it's easy to move, in very high demand, and the ore is pretty available


[20-Aug-24 04:09 PM] laaxus#0000
so I was looking through the metallurgic buildings like FS, GF, HWP, SKF, ASM


[20-Aug-24 04:10 PM] laaxus#0000
just to see what It would look like


[20-Aug-24 04:10 PM] laaxus#0000
but those building had no recipe worth doing


[20-Aug-24 04:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah. I have all those buildings except GF. I make pretty good money with them


[20-Aug-24 04:11 PM] laaxus#0000

But I think igfloz has a good point, a lot of those products go into construction fabs, and the markup ends up there

[20-Aug-24 05:05 PM] marat_sh#0000

[20-Aug-24 05:09 PM] acramernc#0000
is prun down?


[20-Aug-24 05:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
seems to be working for me


[20-Aug-24 05:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I‚Äôd say never. Actually upgrading is best at the beginning and gets worse and worse.
The first permit for a base gives 500 area then the 2nd and 3rd give 250.
When permits start to get expensive you want to maximize them and therefore have 1 permit bases


[20-Aug-24 05:15 PM] acramernc#0000
ooop just had to clear my cookies


[20-Aug-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Depends a lot on desired activity level


[20-Aug-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Upgrades only give 250 area while new bases give... i think it was 495 after CM?


[20-Aug-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
So you lose a lot of value


[20-Aug-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000

I was looking at United Faction Operations for a corporation to join, but there seems to be very few in general - less in Anteras space. 

Is there a Discord server where corporations usually post recruitment notices, or are there just few corporations publicly recruiting?


[20-Aug-24 06:19 PM] jcheung#0000
That's the best place. ADI does have one but they basically use it to boost production on Elon


[20-Aug-24 08:54 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, all of the recruitment notices should be in UFO, under the recruitment board. You need to opt-in seeing the recruitment ads, to see that channel.

so i missed all of them, and had that nagging feeling all of today that i was missing something


[20-Aug-24 09:32 PM] jcheung#0000
now that everything else arrived though, i can see clearly what i'm missing


[20-Aug-24 09:33 PM] tanda#0000
ah, alright. Burn's great for tracking established bases. I definitely use PRUNplanner for initial load in though


[20-Aug-24 09:33 PM] jcheung#0000
i started off with that


[20-Aug-24 09:33 PM] jcheung#0000
but after the base was built i got lazy and decided to default to burn


[20-Aug-24 09:34 PM] jcheung#0000
it doesn't help that this base takes about 30 inputs between WF and feedstock

I agree on this, but there a lot of planets with the right GOGC, where I need more then MCG ... this make the production in the starting time (atm me after 6 months) harder. On long term the profit is calculated per permit and not per base :/

after HQ 20 - for example 21 ~8 Mio | 22 ~12 Mio | 23 ~16 Mio | 24 ~20 Mio | 25 ~24 Mio ... the people take their money and order ships for every route and have more ships between the planets üôÇ

it's just a bug. the game will literally never put it into your ship if you have a warehouse

[21-Aug-24 08:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
I like to think and hope that it's more 1) - I could see the argument for "we have limited dev-time, and we want to spend it on adding new features rather than QoL improvements"


[21-Aug-24 08:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, if you'd consider that a QoL improvement, is a new feature? win-win!?

Those base CD-AAAA-XXXX numbers are randomly generated. Each person has a hidden ID, which connects those CD numbers, to their account, which are listed in descending order, from the date of creation. 

All you need, is a user generated, priority display #, which is easily had from a copy-pasta from anything on the Production Queue window... So yes... I'd hate to to know how many dev hours it would take, to do that.

[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
wait, wouldn't it just be 26^4 * 10^4, no factorials? Since there's 26 choices for each letter and 10 each number?


[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes it would.


[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
(also, is that i3? üôÇ  )


[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Okay, we might run out....


[21-Aug-24 08:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yes it is --- too lazy to switch to dwm.


[21-Aug-24 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
I've always liked i3. I'd switch to it if I ever get around to doing linux on the desktop


[21-Aug-24 08:41 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a better workflow, than with the usual GUI interface that you'd get with desktop editions.


[21-Aug-24 08:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
it syncs well with many minimalist programs, that accept keybinds.


[21-Aug-24 08:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
https://suckless.org/ mmm, the good stuff


[21-Aug-24 08:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I used a lot of emacs in college - mostly org-mode for keeping track of homework and stuff, and notes. That really made me appreciate tiling windows. Not that emacs really counts as minimalist software


[21-Aug-24 08:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

I'd pay more in PRO subscriptions, just


[21-Aug-24 01:11 PM] laaxus#0000
where do you buy a ship ? how much does it cost ?


[21-Aug-24 01:11 PM] realharvey#0000
about 5-8 million


[21-Aug-24 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000
I guess I'm gonna wait a few month


[21-Aug-24 01:13 PM] realharvey#0000
you wont need them for a while anyway


[21-Aug-24 01:13 PM] realharvey#0000
first you you are going to do is upgrading your current ships to bigger cargo holds


[21-Aug-24 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
it's possible ?


[21-Aug-24 01:14 PM] realharvey#0000
yes


[21-Aug-24 01:14 PM] realharvey#0000
not sure what the price for such an upgrade was


[21-Aug-24 01:14 PM] realharvey#0000
between 0,5-1,5 million irc


[21-Aug-24 01:21 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, there are LCB for sales at 715K


[21-Aug-24 01:23 PM] laaxus#0000
but like nobody buys it on the cx

[21-Aug-24 01:23 PM] laaxus#0000
I guess that's because people directly buy where's its produced ?


[21-Aug-24 01:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
you basically order them


[21-Aug-24 01:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
since not everyone can afford them


[21-Aug-24 01:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
also you probably want WCB instead of LCB

[21-Aug-24 04:10 PM] igfloz#0000
I think all he does is shipping conts


[21-Aug-24 04:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And shipping


[21-Aug-24 04:25 PM] flor2081#0000
you can also rent his ships haha


[21-Aug-24 04:25 PM] flor2081#0000

It‚Äôs another community like this


[21-Aug-24 04:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Corps have a HQ that boosts production efficiency on said planet


[21-Aug-24 04:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That‚Äôs about it tho atm


[21-Aug-24 04:28 PM] razenpok#0000
Usually, corps are more tight-knit?


[21-Aug-24 04:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They don‚Äôt have to be


[21-Aug-24 04:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
yup, depends on the corp


[21-Aug-24 04:29 PM] laaxus#0000
I thought corp would cooperate to do a larger scale business than a single one could not do


[21-Aug-24 04:30 PM] flor2081#0000
some do that yeah, others just kinda use it as a group-chat, or offer cheaper internal prices


[21-Aug-24 04:30 PM] flor2081#0000
like here basically


[21-Aug-24 05:09 PM] jcheung#0000

Better install pmmg and look at XIT FIN_SUMMARY


[22-Aug-24 06:18 AM] laaxus#0000
is there any tool that calculates flight length and cost ?


[22-Aug-24 06:19 AM] akyantor#0000
There is a single option for this in game. If you use the command BLU, and then click on "Test" for your current ship configuration (there should only be one for a new player). You can play around with flight length/cost.


[22-Aug-24 06:19 AM] laaxus#0000

what's the best way to control which buildings are prioritized when I don't have enough workers to staff all buildings? if I empty the production queue of a building, does that mean that the workers will get assigned to a different building?


[22-Aug-24 10:38 AM] laaxus#0000
I was doing an excel sheet to see if high volume trading had potential.
Half way in, I release it does not
But I still gonna finish the excel sheets out of spite


[22-Aug-24 10:40 AM] jcheung#0000
you don't. if you just built them within the last few hours you can get a full refund


[22-Aug-24 10:41 AM] jcheung#0000
and then rebuild them closer to POPR


[22-Aug-24 10:41 AM] wooden_turtle#0000
I see, thanks!


[22-Aug-24 10:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
What sort of trading? BID.CX1 to ASK.CX1? BID.CX1 to ASK.CX2? LM.COGC to ASK.CX1?


[22-Aug-24 10:52 AM] laaxus#0000
what do you mean by cx2 and lm.cogc ?


[22-Aug-24 10:56 AM] jcheung#0000
high volume trading does have potential... if you have a lot of money to back it up


[22-Aug-24 10:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Margin trading a commodity on a single CX. Margin trading between two CXes. Buying up cheap goodies at a LM, and shipping them over to a CX for sale.


[22-Aug-24 11:01 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's enough margin, between any of those three, for such things to be viable... You just need to know your commodity markets. Of course, viability simply includes some marginal profit rate, which is far less than ideal, on say a single order transaction. It's best done long-term. Just ask Mr. Insulcris regarding how viable such things are.


[22-Aug-24 11:01 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or lowstrife, or Amp partners. :/

it changes things a bit, gonna update


[22-Aug-24 12:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
2-3 day CX --> CX transits are the norm, per minimal fuel usage.


[22-Aug-24 12:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You might have less, depending on your cargo lading, + orbits.


[22-Aug-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
Well then I can say that it is not worth it, unless you have LOT of capital (and even then, I'm not sure)


[22-Aug-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
Much better to invest in buildings


[22-Aug-24 12:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's better to invest in permits, until like HQ level 52?!?


[22-Aug-24 12:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Of course, it's a mixed bag. If you can't ship your exports from all of those permits, then they're kinda useless?

[22-Aug-24 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
yes


[22-Aug-24 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
buy in one cx, sell in another


[22-Aug-24 12:50 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That‚Äôs a good way to get some use out of your starter ships


[22-Aug-24 12:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Best revenues from opposite CX sectors, makes sense.


[22-Aug-24 12:51 PM] laaxus#0000
In the very beginning, while your base do nothing, yes I agree


[22-Aug-24 12:51 PM] laaxus#0000
but now that I took a loan, my bases are PUMPING, so much that I'm 100% sure that my next investment is upgrading my ships


[22-Aug-24 12:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you are how many days in game?


[22-Aug-24 12:51 PM] laaxus#0000
3 ?


[22-Aug-24 12:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's cheap WCB upgrade offers on UFO... If you're not dealing with heavy ores/metals, you might want different things. You have time to consider it though.


[22-Aug-24 12:53 PM] realharvey#0000
You don't really need bigger ships until you have 2-3 full bases


[22-Aug-24 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000
I do have 2 full bases


[22-Aug-24 12:54 PM] laaxus#0000
and the ships are constantly going from and to the cx because of the input needs


[22-Aug-24 12:54 PM] laaxus#0000
so I would really like upgrading my cargo capacity


[22-Aug-24 12:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Plan ahead. Ships aren't cheap.


[22-Aug-24 12:56 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, I saw the 600k upgrade plan on another server


[22-Aug-24 12:57 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm gonna buy it in around 10 days, and I should have enough stock by then to survive 3-4 days with lighter logistics


[22-Aug-24 12:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
.... Make it 45 days, or so...


[22-Aug-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
Why ?


[22-Aug-24 12:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's a base repair guide somewhere...


[22-Aug-24 12:59 PM] igfloz#0000
You need to repair bases every 90 days. I think thats what Roh is referring to


[22-Aug-24 12:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But: 1) You'll save your money for the needed cylic things (base repairs, inventory resupplies). 2) You'll still be under the age-deadline for those other-server offers.


[22-Aug-24 12:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm referring to a 45 day cyclic repair period, for most bases.


[22-Aug-24 01:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It keeps your productive output, at like 99.3% of projected Prunplanner figures, throughout, so that you get minimal lag in production.


[22-Aug-24 01:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Cuz, after 45 days of no-repairs... you start to get the lagz


[22-Aug-24 01:00 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't see myself expanding a third base currently, would be possible at high ship speed, but the micro management would be too high


[22-Aug-24 01:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you are doing what, exactly? just general deets, I don't need prunplanner specs


[22-Aug-24 01:01 PM] laaxus#0000
Pe production on hephaistus, AL production on deimos


[22-Aug-24 01:01 PM] laaxus#0000
roughly


[22-Aug-24 01:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you're importing C, no?


[22-Aug-24 01:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
for Heph.


[22-Aug-24 01:02 PM] laaxus#0000
C and H yeah


[22-Aug-24 01:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
how many permits did you apply already?


[22-Aug-24 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
My hq is lvl 2


[22-Aug-24 01:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Consider that the upgrades have a few weeks waiting time if you want the cheap one


[22-Aug-24 01:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So you could get on the list now to have it when you need it


[22-Aug-24 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
oh good to know


[22-Aug-24 01:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This is a 1 permit, 500 area plan for C-production anywhere. Maybe it'll let you help cut down on your short-term logistical requirements.... Multi - permitting is generally preferred for those, who still haven't upgraded their starters, as it helps to cut down on exports, by maximizing I/O commodity compression ratios.

[22-Aug-24 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
This seems like a low roi base
Shouldn't i try to focus on ROI ?


[22-Aug-24 01:15 PM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, I have time to spare so I'm gonna try a few things in planner


[22-Aug-24 01:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The key details are in the top right... total Production Overview... You're cutting out agri imports to burn at a C-base instance. You can also feed subsequent C outputs, into another 500 base area segment of BMPs, which will only require you to import H?


[22-Aug-24 01:24 PM] laaxus#0000
but i'll also have to supply this new base, with water and anything
How does this improve my situation of "I want to reduce the number of flight" ?


[22-Aug-24 01:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You tell me. I'd think it's pretty nasty.

[22-Aug-24 01:25 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
At Heph... like 2-3 days of flights, to a 3 permit instance.


[22-Aug-24 01:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or less. The orbit intervals get you done in like 1.5 days, overall, for weekly requirements.


[22-Aug-24 01:27 PM] laaxus#0000
you want me to build the farm and inc on hepha ?


[22-Aug-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
its not a farm


[22-Aug-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's HYF


[22-Aug-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
and still, you tell me


[22-Aug-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
weigh your expansion options


[22-Aug-24 01:28 PM] laaxus#0000
I thought I should use permit to build other base 
Wouldn't it waste the building cost of hyp and inc and HB1 ?


[22-Aug-24 01:28 PM] laaxus#0000
I mean


[22-Aug-24 01:28 PM] laaxus#0000
I get your point


[22-Aug-24 01:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You will have limited shipping options, for years.


[22-Aug-24 01:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Each new base, on a new planet, will require more shipping provisions.


[22-Aug-24 01:29 PM] laaxus#0000
in a few month, the current cost of building those building will be peanuts in my weekly benefit


[22-Aug-24 01:29 PM] laaxus#0000
so I could upgrade the base in the current time


[22-Aug-24 01:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Thorough planning in the early game, (you right now), will save you headaches later...


[22-Aug-24 01:33 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
personnaly i prefer the 1 base 1 permit strategy


[22-Aug-24 01:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ I'll counter with.... It's a late-stage min-max strategy.


[22-Aug-24 01:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Unless you're going to be offering free FTL ships to people, they will have to purchase their ships on their own means.


[22-Aug-24 01:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
+ you can time repairs with permit reduction to place a new base


[22-Aug-24 01:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ I'm doing that now --- decoupling x2, 3 permit bases, to expand RAT/DW production around ANT space.


[22-Aug-24 01:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would benefit more from expanding current planet - > use building to make stuff - > when repair time refund the base -> place a new base


[22-Aug-24 01:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Of course... I have built up my shipping capacity, to be able to do such things now.


[22-Aug-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
other option : rush harmonia base and let it empty for the current time

[22-Aug-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
deimos hepha yes


[22-Aug-24 01:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
rush Harm.


[22-Aug-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I rushed Deimos back in my day --- no regrets.


[22-Aug-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It was at basically the same free plot margin.


[22-Aug-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Give it ~2 months, and the whole influx of newbros at ANT, will be rushing Harm, along with you.


[22-Aug-24 01:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
Bruh I hate that plot limit is a thing


[22-Aug-24 01:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
FOMO is real with this one


[22-Aug-24 01:39 PM] laaxus#0000
This'll change if/when the game become much more popular


[22-Aug-24 01:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It is... I've tried to explain it in UFO discord lounge.... The old timers don't notice it... But the newbros will be noticing it, and they will be forced to settle more inhospitable planets, along the way.


[22-Aug-24 01:39 PM] laaxus#0000
if the playerbase multiply by 10, the dev WILL have to do something


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No they won't.


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The scheme is by design.


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
it's either more place or new server


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No new server either.


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
players gonna second base on one green in 2 years bruh


[22-Aug-24 01:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I like the idea of getting your one faction space planet then having to move out


[22-Aug-24 01:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
it gonna be a division between new and old players like in EVE


[22-Aug-24 01:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I've focused on Insitor faction specialties... Of course I'm losing out on the higher tier margins, but there's plenty of others who are doing just that.


[22-Aug-24 01:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
We shouldn't focus to much on higher margins... do what you enjoy doing... like @avalock ... Blood is chewing rocks and having the time of their life

[22-Aug-24 01:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's also side-arguments to the higher margin stuff....


[22-Aug-24 01:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
LUX consumables don't actually contribute all that much to productivity bonuses, and they're an incredible pain for new-bros to get their hands on, either self-production, or raw purchases via CX.


[22-Aug-24 01:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
Not really true, Lux for Pio and Set are not that expancive and increase your daily margins


[22-Aug-24 01:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's hard to get them in the first few days but after that it's just another consumable


[22-Aug-24 01:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Weigh the increased margins, versus the capital sink required to get those additional margins.


[22-Aug-24 01:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a decent inquiry. I don't need a response on it, just food for thought.


[22-Aug-24 01:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
both will go up... your revenue and consumption


[22-Aug-24 01:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
prun planer always shows daily increase of marging with addition of lux


[22-Aug-24 01:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
plus you don't consume that much


[22-Aug-24 01:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
my 1700 pio eat 8.5 COF a day


[22-Aug-24 01:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
not that much


[22-Aug-24 01:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No. But when COF is like 8x that of OVE, it might be a good question to look into.


[22-Aug-24 01:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's very easy to overproduce OVE


[22-Aug-24 01:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
that's why price is so low


[22-Aug-24 01:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
same with I if you overproduce it


[22-Aug-24 01:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
OVE prices are so low, since people are making surplus RCOs, enough to keep their prices low.


[22-Aug-24 01:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You'd see the same with COF, but CAF/COF is a harder tree to get into, especially with the NS/H2O requirements.


[22-Aug-24 01:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's just an issue with a recipe


[22-Aug-24 01:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
COT base is expancive to make + you could be making NL / KV instead of COT


[22-Aug-24 02:01 PM] archielvahr#0000

It's a plot limit thing, if you do HYFs. :/


[22-Aug-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you do HYFs, you don't get the fertility bonus, so you could run them anywhere. ANT has a couple HYF planets, like Thalassa b


[22-Aug-24 02:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Boucher/Etherwind/Kinza/Pyrgos are much better for water extraction rates.... But liquid water is basically a scarce commodity if you want triple-green base environments.


[22-Aug-24 02:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Thalassa c has higher water extraction than all those üòâ


[22-Aug-24 02:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
no it doesnt.


[22-Aug-24 02:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ice Station Alpha is basically B tier... Harmonia is C tier.


[22-Aug-24 02:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
ANT is basically screwed on the water.


[22-Aug-24 02:05 PM] archielvahr#0000

HSE + INS cuts down on the break-even PPUs for water from SE-110c.


[22-Aug-24 02:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's good enough for HYF at SE-110b.... But it's super sketch.


[22-Aug-24 02:09 PM] archielvahr#0000

Apparently, HSE+INS doesn't even make a dint in the break even pricing of H2O extraction, LOL!


[22-Aug-24 02:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
6.85 ICA per H2O from say Boucher, versus 9.21 AIC per H2O from Ice Station Alpha.


[22-Aug-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's higher upfront costs, but that shouldn't really matter much to people these days


[22-Aug-24 02:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Sketchy, being that I'd love a triple-green water world around ANT, with SE-110c's density. But we're not getting that.

Nope.

ANT prices are currently a little lower than other regions, that is a good insight. PP30D or 30DUNIVERSE are the better long term models. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[22-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
What JeanPaulMarat has shared is a little more complicated but you get really nice returns doing a mix of metals like that


[22-Aug-24 04:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would lower the Li unless you can find a buyer It's not traded daily


[22-Aug-24 04:40 PM] laaxus#0000
I do not have the same li price

[22-Aug-24 04:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can change the sell price here to better represent what you are trying to do... but you will have to update it manually or remove it once price is stable


[22-Aug-24 04:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
even at 1700 it's still one of the better options

[23-Aug-24 06:52 AM] tanda#0000
yes, as long as a recipe can be run (you have the ingredients) it will alternate as slots open up


[23-Aug-24 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
and that scales up, too. If you have 7 recurring orders, the top 1 will go to the bottom of the order queue when it gets started


[23-Aug-24 06:53 AM] laaxus#0000
neat


[23-Aug-24 09:21 AM] riseoffilth#0000
but annoyingly, if one recipe runs out, it will just sit there and block a build slot from being utilized


[23-Aug-24 09:21 AM] riseoffilth#0000
bafflingly stupid design

is there any way to show the burn for the inventory of a base, like for the consumables ?


[23-Aug-24 09:28 AM] riseoffilth#0000
download the PMMG extension on firefox or another browser that it works on


[23-Aug-24 09:28 AM] riseoffilth#0000
follow the installation process, make an account, etc


[23-Aug-24 09:28 AM] riseoffilth#0000
then the command "XIT burn_[planetid]"


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] laaxus#0000
incredible, thanks


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] riseoffilth#0000
be aware, if you change recipes, the data of "burn" still lists the old items, and if you lack those items, it will falsely tell you that you are out


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] riseoffilth#0000
you would have to wipe your cache to correct


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] laaxus#0000
reloading the page isn't enough ?


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] riseoffilth#0000
it is not


[23-Aug-24 09:31 AM] razesdark#0000
How do you even make a FIO account for the PMMG extension?


[23-Aug-24 09:31 AM] riseoffilth#0000
it wont *not* tell you what you currently need, but the function that lets you look at all bases at a glance, that shows you which one has the least amount of days worth of materials, will read the lowest/incorrect item


[23-Aug-24 09:31 AM] riseoffilth#0000
i may be misattributing the account thing for FIO for PMMG


[23-Aug-24 09:31 AM] riseoffilth#0000
its been like a year since i did this


[23-Aug-24 09:32 AM] razesdark#0000
I looked at the FIO website and it doesn't have a link to a registration form that I could find.
I read somewhere that you should find instructions in the extension, but I can't seem to find that either.

I was under the impression that PMMG and FIO was the same plugin since it lets you use your FIO account as well, so I only PMMG installed

@cptboby you should rent a warhouse on Antares commodity exchange

`WAR ANT` into a buffer and you can rent one there

[23-Aug-24 12:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[23-Aug-24 12:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
closed means that I accepted it

[23-Aug-24 12:26 PM] igfloz#0000
correct


[23-Aug-24 12:27 PM] igfloz#0000
a WH or base storage is required to deliver


[23-Aug-24 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
100 AIC per warhouse (WAR) is pretty cheap and worth the cost

100 per week its pretty cheap


[23-Aug-24 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000

[23-Aug-24 12:28 PM] igfloz#0000
You will end up renting multiple WH as your needs grow


[23-Aug-24 12:28 PM] cptboby#0000
if i need more than 1 wh i will probably have a lot of cash to burn too

[24-Aug-24 05:13 PM] laaxus#0000
In general, how do you detect that the current production is higher than the current demand ?


[24-Aug-24 05:14 PM] laaxus#0000
I feel like that supply of pe is higher, because the ask offers keep coming, with lower and lower price
While there's no new bid offers


[24-Aug-24 05:15 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not concerned yet, because there's a big bid offer that would still guarantee profit for me


[24-Aug-24 05:15 PM] jcheung#0000
That might be in indication it's coming down, or just a small lull


[24-Aug-24 05:17 PM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, my biggest beginner mistake was not to keep a large enough liquidity wallet


[24-Aug-24 05:17 PM] laaxus#0000
because that forces me to buy at ask price and sell at bid price


[24-Aug-24 05:18 PM] laaxus#0000
when I want to buy at bid price and sell at ask price


[24-Aug-24 05:19 PM] razenpok#0000
In the beginning, you don't have much choice. Either that, or you sit on liquidity and not use it to generate more income


[24-Aug-24 05:20 PM] igfloz#0000
Not really, you can still put it up at ask price, but you might find it may take a few days to sell. I think it comes down to "how much (and how quickly) people want it"


[24-Aug-24 05:20 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah but I received a large amount of cash from grant + loan
I invested a lot and keep around 1/4 as liquidity, then I realised I needed to store a few days worth of consumption on each base for convenience
Which reduced my liquidity to not so much


[24-Aug-24 05:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
I look at what volume the good is being traded daily at ASK


[24-Aug-24 05:22 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm forced to sell at bid price else I can't buy the input goods for production
Today I put all I've produced on ask, if in 2 days it didn't sold, I'll have to sell at bid

max out your queue


[24-Aug-24 05:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
produce 5 items and adjust the daily production

yes, I'm producing pe, but also mcg exo and rep


[24-Aug-24 05:25 PM] laaxus#0000
I'll see how it goes


[24-Aug-24 05:25 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah on the right side you will see how much you produce daily


[24-Aug-24 05:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
aim at half of daily volume at ASK


[24-Aug-24 05:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
it will be harder for items that are not being traded daily and you will have to make your strategy


[24-Aug-24 05:28 PM] laaxus#0000

...and thats kinda where my "how quick people want it ($$ or product)" statement comes from. If ya wanna turn a quick buck, you're gonna sell at bid. If ya wanna make profits, you set up asks


[24-Aug-24 05:31 PM] laaxus#0000
You're both the seller and the buyer
What can I do, what can i say ?


[24-Aug-24 05:31 PM] insulacrisium#0000
yep, spread trading


[24-Aug-24 05:32 PM] laaxus#0000
I mean, that's what happens when the spread is 10% of the ask price


[24-Aug-24 05:32 PM] laaxus#0000
but still


[24-Aug-24 05:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
He is a trader, they make money from trade difference between ASK and BID


[24-Aug-24 05:33 PM] insulacrisium#0000
you have to consider the time-value of your money too.  Sometimes you can earn higher returns by getting a lower price instantly, and reinvesting the money into production expansion.  While more established players have less options to increase their ROI, so they let their money sit in bids for longer time periods.


[24-Aug-24 05:33 PM] laaxus#0000
it works, until I sell thrice the anteras global demand at his bid price and still make a profit

I need a contract supplier for PE anyway.  Mine went inactive.

For the current market, it's not worth it to me at 9.5.  I can source it much cheaper in BEN (which is where my current PE source is) than even ANT bid price.  In fact, I'm exporting from BEN to ANT.  However, if you successfully crash the market in ANT, then I'll stop importing there, and if you still can keep prices down, then maybe we can talk about meeting between ask and bid.

I'm doing my best to make them, but base decoupling to SE-110 is 21 days out. There's also no shipyard at Harmonia's system, so further RAT production is troublesome, atl least for me.

I'm working on establishing SE-110 this coming week. Should have the majority of the materials ready to go


[24-Aug-24 07:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd like to say its due to the influx of new players, but from what Ive been seeing, the larger, more established players, have been buying out my ASK.RAT orders, intra-day.


[24-Aug-24 07:05 PM] tanda#0000
possibly the majority of older players have mostly stopped producing RAT?

Most of the RAT uptake , into higher tiers, is into FIM/MEA production, when  considered in-volume, is used by the SE/SLs  for EDC/IDC production.

if PE falls enough, I might consider slapping down some PP1's strictly to make BDE


[25-Aug-24 03:34 AM] akyantor#0000
I use some of my PE for that purpose, as there's generally not all that much non-MM offers for BDE


[25-Aug-24 03:34 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, I've nearly continously used my own supply of BDE rather than selling it, for expansion.


[25-Aug-24 03:34 AM] laaxus#0000
isn't it better roi wise to just buy from MM ?


[25-Aug-24 03:35 AM] tanda#0000

[25-Aug-24 03:35 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm pretty sure I'm making it for well below the MM price given I'm manufacturing the input materials.


[25-Aug-24 03:36 AM] akyantor#0000
Even buying the materials has a 10 day ROI at the current price.

[25-Aug-24 03:37 AM] laaxus#0000
if you say so


[25-Aug-24 03:40 AM] tanda#0000
looks like if you're buying PE straight off the market, you can make BDE at 1700/unit


[25-Aug-24 03:40 AM] tanda#0000
it gets cheaper when you manufacture PE, obviously


[25-Aug-24 03:41 AM] laaxus#0000

[25-Aug-24 03:41 AM] tanda#0000
opportunity cost is a slippery slope


[25-Aug-24 03:41 AM] laaxus#0000
If you sell at ask price and buy at ask price, it doesn't increase profit to produce your input goods


[25-Aug-24 03:41 AM] tanda#0000
to me the opportunity is being able to supply cheap bfabs


[25-Aug-24 03:41 AM] tanda#0000
make that ADI grant go farther


[25-Aug-24 03:42 AM] akyantor#0000
It ignores the liquidity point too. If there's more demand for BDE than PE then it doesn't matter if on paper you could make more by selling the PE, as eventually the price is driven down.


[25-Aug-24 03:43 AM] akyantor#0000
There will always be demand for BDE as folks need it to expand / repair existing bases, whereas there **may **be a smaller pool of available buyers for the intermediary product.


[25-Aug-24 03:44 AM] laaxus#0000
i see


[25-Aug-24 03:47 AM] akyantor#0000
That said.. a lot of people have the same opinion about the buy/sell point for intermediary products. I tend to lean towards buying consumables, but building out the full supply chain for an end product (for example I make nearly all the products to enable me to make bfab/lfab - which makes expansion very cheap for me as I'm only paying the consumable cost). There are plenty of folks who don't do that though.


[25-Aug-24 03:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I was offering the bfabs/lfabs to ADI, but in a rapid expansion phase at the moment so is currently unavailable. I'd intend on making it avaialble again to help folks maximise their ADI grant, as Tanda and other folks have done with reducing the cost of goods like INS. For example, I was able to offer BDE at 1,600/u... well below market.


[25-Aug-24 05:16 AM] jvaler#0000

1) when the (CX) Price doesn't exist ( no ask order for exemple) it put 0, leading to false calculation of profit and roi


[25-Aug-24 11:01 AM] avalock#0000
ahhh okay


[25-Aug-24 11:01 AM] laaxus#0000
2) When there's a large spread, I would like to be able to calculate and compare the profit for the AVG,ask,bid (and custom) Price


[25-Aug-24 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
3) with this sheet, I'll know the roi of every recipe in Real Time, without manually checking them 1 by 1


[25-Aug-24 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
4) I needed the data for future project and the api is lacking

you can split by space, -, x, =, >, `,`


[25-Aug-24 12:53 PM] jcheung#0000
though perhaps starting split with ` : ` followed by `=>` would be best, then you have building, list of inputs, list of outputs


[25-Aug-24 12:53 PM] jcheung#0000
and can further split from there


[25-Aug-24 01:00 PM] laaxus#0000

I might be able to export into the format I desire using python and panda


[25-Aug-24 01:01 PM] razenpok#0000
Use json endpoints then, they are structured better

that's what shows up when you try to place a buy order at the same price as your own ask order, right?

a second person would just buy from said ask order then lol

do what's done with H2O.AI1 and just make the spread as small as possible

A lot of people use it (basic consumable for Settlers) but you don't need it in large quantities


[26-Aug-24 10:41 AM] marat_sh#0000
so the price will stay at high point for a while unless people dump their PT stockpiles


[26-Aug-24 10:59 AM] jvaler#0000
it's not really lmfao

[26-Aug-24 04:03 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm building a FP base
For now I'm buying from the market
IF it increases the prices and incentive more farming, then great


[26-Aug-24 04:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
The return per dollar on FP bases is good, but the return per permit is poor, as you grow the latter becomes much more important than the former.


[26-Aug-24 04:04 PM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, at the moment, what I need is big ROI


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] laaxus#0000
the cost of expanding is low so low ROI > Revenue per permit


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] laaxus#0000
however, I'd like your opinion


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
that is indeed the case for a good while


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] laaxus#0000
what's good profit per permit ? Medium ? Bad ?
What's your benchmark ?


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
60k+ I say pretty good


[26-Aug-24 04:05 PM] jcheung#0000
to start i think 30-50k is reasonable target


[26-Aug-24 04:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
120k+ amazing


[26-Aug-24 04:06 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
can only speak for myslef, i was aiming 75k once past hq 10


[26-Aug-24 04:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah if you are brand new and you have unused permits, I would say go for it


[26-Aug-24 04:06 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
1-10 roi roi roi


[26-Aug-24 04:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
higher profits do help cover the ship youll end up needing


[26-Aug-24 04:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
thats a secondary thing to consider. if your base needs 50% of a ship, it cost 2.5-3 mil extra


[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
if it need only 1 lcb per week, thats only 800k-1 mil in ship


[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
+ if you time it correctly you can scrap the permit instead of repairing it


[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] laaxus#0000
wdym ?


[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
buildings lose condition


[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] marat_sh#0000

[26-Aug-24 04:08 PM] laaxus#0000
agree until now


[26-Aug-24 04:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's for future when you will value permits more then cash


[26-Aug-24 04:09 PM] laaxus#0000
Oh ok I understand
When your base needs to be repaired, you can just destroy the building and start anew


[26-Aug-24 04:10 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah You get some materials back


[26-Aug-24 04:10 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
anew with something more profitable


[26-Aug-24 04:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ yeah something more profitable, don't destroy building just to build the same one again

Anyway, H production so hot right now


[28-Aug-24 04:31 PM] laaxus#0000
Another day spent improving my excel sheet


[28-Aug-24 04:31 PM] laaxus#0000
In game time played : 15m max


[28-Aug-24 05:41 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't even build my own H extraction base I don't have the shipping capacity to export it


[28-Aug-24 05:41 PM] laaxus#0000
what a hard time to be a pe producer


[28-Aug-24 05:47 PM] jvaler#0000
oh wait yeah H is more expensive


[28-Aug-24 05:47 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm ngl i didn't even notice üò≠


[28-Aug-24 05:48 PM] jvaler#0000
"what could H cost, 200 AIC/u?"


[28-Aug-24 05:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's ether someone stopped dropping H at CX or People foundout about PE


[28-Aug-24 05:50 PM] .shiva.#0000
PE is still making money hand over fist though?


[28-Aug-24 05:50 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah but not as much


[28-Aug-24 05:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
easy to make and being bought in large stacks


[28-Aug-24 05:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
either way works for me Since MCG is hot as well üòÖ (not as hot as two days ago)


[28-Aug-24 05:54 PM] .shiva.#0000
oh no the ROI is like almost a week now instead of like 3 days lol


[28-Aug-24 05:54 PM] laaxus#0000
MCG ROI also decreased but I don't know why


[28-Aug-24 05:54 PM] jvaler#0000
16d is pretty bad actually... hm


[28-Aug-24 05:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
17k+ MCG in ask orders


[28-Aug-24 05:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
that weren't there two days ago


[28-Aug-24 05:55 PM] jcheung#0000
MCG went back up recently to MM for a bit


[28-Aug-24 05:55 PM] laaxus#0000
wth


[28-Aug-24 05:56 PM] laaxus#0000
my theory is that everybody followed archiel article and printed PE
Price fell
Everybody swtiched to MCG
Price fell


[28-Aug-24 05:56 PM] jcheung#0000
So if i had to guess, the price surge kicjed a couple people into putting out some of their stockpiles


[28-Aug-24 05:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
There was 0 supply of MCG for a few days


[28-Aug-24 05:56 PM] jvaler#0000
i didn't realize PT was as good as it is rn tho... i'mma drop my CXOS down to 450 AIC/u


[28-Aug-24 05:57 PM] jvaler#0000

[28-Aug-24 05:58 PM] jcheung#0000
BMP products are easy to see a lot of variability because of how quick they output. What people seem to like to do though is retool the entire base to chase the best profit, which means the not-best sees a massive output reduction


[28-Aug-24 05:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've been slowly getting reps down from 780 since i've started making them üòÖ


[28-Aug-24 06:00 PM] laaxus#0000
REP is the highest recipe by ask price


[28-Aug-24 06:00 PM] jvaler#0000
ty for braving the CX for me lmao

i'm always scared to lower the price of my big orders due to resellers


[28-Aug-24 06:01 PM] jvaler#0000
yup i was checking BMP prices and noticed that, which made me check and decide to lower mine


[28-Aug-24 06:02 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe i could make a dent in my stock, it's a lot of illiquid value atm :P


[28-Aug-24 06:02 PM] laaxus#0000
4k is 2 weeks worth of sales


[28-Aug-24 06:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
probably a bit more


[28-Aug-24 06:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would say around 2.5-3 weeks


[28-Aug-24 06:03 PM] jvaler#0000

[28-Aug-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
my vibes have been telling me to make RATs for a while


[28-Aug-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
the wallet begged to differ


[28-Aug-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
but now look at all this fancy infrastructure I own!


[28-Aug-24 08:05 PM] sidepipe#0000

I partnered with Evayoo out there, so not having to drop 3 bases in a go helps

[29-Aug-24 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000

[29-Aug-24 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
give me 1M and I crash the med market


[29-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
#agp-operations is about the best you get probably


[29-Aug-24 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I could fill every bid order in a week


[29-Aug-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
nah it's ok, I'm doing fine


[29-Aug-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I just can't invest in a chem base right now


[29-Aug-24 11:49 AM] jcheung#0000
why not?

[29-Aug-24 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
there's a couple people that offer loans too


[29-Aug-24 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
at pretty decent rates at that


[29-Aug-24 11:50 AM] laaxus#0000
I took a loan for a RAT base


[29-Aug-24 11:50 AM] laaxus#0000
(which is a far better and safer investment)


[29-Aug-24 11:50 AM] laaxus#0000
so I'm waiting a bit  to pay it back


[29-Aug-24 11:51 AM] laaxus#0000
and, then I'll see


[29-Aug-24 11:52 AM] jcheung#0000
lowstrife?


[29-Aug-24 11:52 AM] jcheung#0000
or someone else

Shrewdsum


[29-Aug-24 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
lowstrife and evolivolution offer 3% loans as well. taking one of those may not be the worst idea


[29-Aug-24 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
I fear taking a loan, making a base and not being able to supply it


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
fair


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] laaxus#0000
I'll wait a week


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
what's your current shipping capacity look like


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] laaxus#0000
2 starter ship


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
sorry, i mean utilization


[29-Aug-24 12:02 PM] laaxus#0000
they're moving constantly at slow speed


[29-Aug-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
I could increase the speed but that would eat my profit


[29-Aug-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm in the queue for upgrading my ships


[29-Aug-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000
once I have that, I'll be MUCH more confident


[29-Aug-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000
and it doesn't hurt to accumulate a bit of cash meanwhile

Everything that is over 3500$/d I consider profitable


[29-Aug-24 07:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
REPs price is pretty high still but it's not being traded in high volume


[29-Aug-24 07:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
MCG is very HOT now


[29-Aug-24 07:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
PE is the most stable


[29-Aug-24 07:59 PM] dizzplaced#0000
My figures take a worst outlook from a buy/sell bid/ask


[29-Aug-24 08:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
I see


[29-Aug-24 08:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
my settings are set to BUY from ASK and SELL at ASK


[29-Aug-24 08:00 PM] dizzplaced#0000
I only have 2 ships. MCG sucks with only 1000t of capacity


[29-Aug-24 08:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah try to mix them in


[29-Aug-24 08:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
my sweet spot is 1000 MCG per day


[29-Aug-24 08:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can do more if you only care about MCG


[29-Aug-24 08:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
but I produce 6 other things


[29-Aug-24 08:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can try to find a deal with EPO and sell OFFs to @riseoffilth


[29-Aug-24 08:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am sure he needs them in large quantities


[29-Aug-24 08:04 PM] jcheung#0000
I doubt dizz would be pleased with the OFF prices


[29-Aug-24 08:04 PM] jcheung#0000
But they are indeed secure


[29-Aug-24 08:04 PM] jcheung#0000
And also high volume so they mix well with MCG


[29-Aug-24 08:05 PM] dizzplaced#0000
-16k per day after feeding the workers


[29-Aug-24 08:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah Rise gets OFF at 85/u if you reduce production cost you can get better margin


[29-Aug-24 08:05 PM] jcheung#0000
What are you using to calculate?


[29-Aug-24 08:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
Manufacturing is pretty hungry on inputs


[29-Aug-24 08:05 PM] jcheung#0000
That doesn't feel right


[29-Aug-24 08:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
My daily input is 153k üòÖ

[29-Aug-24 08:07 PM] marat_sh#0000

[29-Aug-24 08:08 PM] razenpok#0000
I'm at 104k according to prunplanner, or at 80k according to pmmg


[29-Aug-24 08:08 PM] razenpok#0000

[29-Aug-24 08:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
Main problem with OFF is the EPO price

[29-Aug-24 08:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Well. Either way i don't swe how you're getting negatives with OFF assuming you're using CX values


[29-Aug-24 08:13 PM] dizzplaced#0000
You get negatives after you factor in cost of consumables


[29-Aug-24 08:14 PM] razenpok#0000
To be fair, BMP output productivity has fallen **hard** this month


[29-Aug-24 08:14 PM] jcheung#0000
Figured it out. This doesn't take into account cogc or experts


[29-Aug-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
we got 2-3 new players on manufacturing I think


[29-Aug-24 08:14 PM] razenpok#0000
Or lux probs


[29-Aug-24 08:15 PM] jcheung#0000
Probably assumes 100% which would be lux but no cogc or expert


[29-Aug-24 08:15 PM] dizzplaced#0000
Yea it doesn't. I have a modifier for each base since that changes things


[29-Aug-24 08:15 PM] razenpok#0000
I don't think it's new players. I see some oldies undercutting the bmp markets

I had the same situation you are having right now... I've started on phobos got 3 bmps... received 750k... build new bmps on heph and slowly disassembled phobos base in a span of 4 days


[29-Aug-24 08:19 PM] dizzplaced#0000
I've managed to get it done in around 36hrs but I was almost at the end of a production cycle


[29-Aug-24 08:19 PM] dizzplaced#0000
7mins left and I'll do the teardown on Phobos


[29-Aug-24 08:20 PM] marat_sh#0000

Ast is good for WLPs since they take a lot of area and HSE scales per building instead of area

[29-Aug-24 08:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
printers take very little area though


[29-Aug-24 08:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
All of them should be settled since there is just 5 planets with manufacturing... but Ast shouldn't be the second option

does that count as an explosion?

i meant chemical reaction explosive

You can get legit explosions if you send enough electricity into water


[29-Aug-24 10:20 PM] jcheung#0000
Breaks it down into hydrogen which explodes nicely


[29-Aug-24 10:36 PM] tanda#0000
yep! H + O +O = quite a lot of heat

why does this never recommend an Antares planet


[31-Aug-24 07:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
mmm


[31-Aug-24 08:00 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Because Antares is hard level difficulty?


[31-Aug-24 08:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Message molp in-game... Like you, I didn't see an ANT faction recommendation. Most new-bros pour over the wiki information, like its their Bible (it actually is).... This is #factional_discrimination, if I ever seen it!


[31-Aug-24 08:03 PM] tanda#0000
Isn't Antares as a faction relatively new? with the other factions being older?


[31-Aug-24 08:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes? But it largely shouldn't matter. The wiki should be #even_keel (distributed).


[31-Aug-24 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
I'm just thinking it probably hasn't been rewritten in a while


[31-Aug-24 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
which is a different even bigger issue


[31-Aug-24 08:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's distinct realities, which players will pour over, check up on "official" wiki pages, and make their decisions on.


[31-Aug-24 08:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
No it very likely hasn't.


[31-Aug-24 08:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I had... a listing of "starter" planets....


[31-Aug-24 08:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Could this be had, once more?


[31-Aug-24 08:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Someone has that info.


[31-Aug-24 08:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's thoroughly relevant, in that --- all the newbros who ask questions, within in-game COMGs, are getting sent directly to the APEX wiki links... And they are told to learn all of it, exactly. Since ANT starter planets are not being mentioned within the starter profession recommendations --- you're basically losing potential market share, of what will eventually be, in 1-2 years.


[31-Aug-24 08:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
.... Initial conditions largely dictate individual company expansions, opportunity cost, options... Et.c. E.g. A starter in Insitor space, with x2 500 t/m3 FTL ships, would not want to expand to ANT space, before a certain HQ and ship # basis... IF they would instead have started out in ANT (Harmonia/Deimos, or others), they would be immediately incentive'd with expanding their operations in ANT space, and not HRT, BEN, or anything else, due to #reasons. <---- is done.

that's the case if edges are unweighted and using bfs, but as soon as it becomes weighted, you need djikstra and it becomes  O((V + E) log V)

[03-Sep-24 10:02 AM] laaxus#0000
So yeah, to find the best investment, you have to consider many option. Ofcourse the recipe profit is a great indicator, but it does  no matter if you can't sell your production long term, or if you can't supply. Therefore, the number of available bidders, the volume and weight of the recipe and the distance from the cx all matters. However, with a clever mix of recipes, you can reduce the shipping cost and therefore increase overall profit in some case. But there's more to it, for example, the ...

Hello, in the planning stage of a production expansion and Id like to check for interest on having bases sponsored. Anyone here would be interested in a sponsored base bringing in 50k/day? I would take care of materials and pay an amount every week covering the consumables and payment


[03-Sep-24 05:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Still in the planning phase but before going further i want to see if its something interesting anyone


[03-Sep-24 05:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Either that or i would subsidize the base cost with a grant of 1mil in exchange for supplying a certain commodity at a preagreed price for 6-8 weeks


[04-Sep-24 03:48 AM] laaxus#0000
~~is there any new player in here that don't know what to do with one of his ship ?
I'm willing to give shipping contracts above market rate for the next 3 days.
@dizzplaced @shadowfax6562 @getonthetrain maybe ?~~

Edit : I found a solution


[04-Sep-24 03:52 AM] realharvey#0000
What shipping route and what's your rate for that


[04-Sep-24 04:05 AM] laaxus#0000
ANT -> norwick
Norwick -> ANT
3 (maybe 4) times for a beginner 500T starter ship

Or

ANT ->  Norwick
once for a 2k/2k ship (3K/1k works too but i'll only pay for 1K tonnage then)


Using this comment I believe the standart market rate  would be 32k for a 2kT cargo.
I'm willing to pay 12.5k per 500 Tonnage, meaning 50k for the 2k/2k, or 15k per trip (30k for the round trip) for the beginner starter ship
I believe that's fair

[04-Sep-24 04:09 AM] realharvey#0000
so 50k for back and forth with a 2k2k?


[04-Sep-24 04:10 AM] laaxus#0000
I won't be able to fill the 2k/2k on the return
but essentially yes


[04-Sep-24 04:10 AM] laaxus#0000
do you think it's fair ?


[04-Sep-24 04:24 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Back and forth fuel/depreciation costs for a 2k, is around 10k net.


[04-Sep-24 04:25 AM] realharvey#0000
I cant really answer that question. I don't do shipping because its a lot of busy work for not much profit. But that is very subjective. It might be more interesting for newer People


[04-Sep-24 04:25 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Beyond that, its up to those contracting themselves, with another, to figure things out.


[04-Sep-24 04:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Newer people easily phase out of contract shipping, when they figure out that they can make more revenues, weekly, by using their ships to supply their bases.


[04-Sep-24 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
but not for the newest players who only need one ship to supply their only base.


[04-Sep-24 04:28 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes.


[04-Sep-24 04:29 AM] realharvey#0000
I can fly that route once for you with a 2k2k to help you out if its urgent. But otherwise its not interesting for me


[04-Sep-24 04:30 AM] laaxus#0000
it's kinda urgent, one of my 2 ships is upgrading and I just can't supply my norwick base atm

how soon could you leave for norwick ?


[04-Sep-24 04:31 AM] realharvey#0000

You can change jobs at any time. I've seen old timers who switched jobs in their 40-50's, into better things.


[07-Sep-24 02:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes. most "careers" are just jobs.

I'm also certified in Dante which is like Audio and Video over IP


[07-Sep-24 02:47 PM] avalock#0000
actually pretty cool stuff, even if its a bit of shit


[07-Sep-24 02:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Most of the industry standards in networking are just industry knowledge examinations - no schooling needed, but you'll probably have to do a bit of reading.


[07-Sep-24 02:47 PM] avalock#0000
yeee I'm doing a CCNA course rn, just finishing up a chapter atm

Looks like LBH, LSE, and BBH are the money makers for PP2 right now

LBH BBH and LTA


[07-Sep-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
LTA has liquidity issues


[07-Sep-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
BBH is better due to volume


[07-Sep-24 04:19 PM] laaxus#0000
at least, you'd make money by selling at bid price


[07-Sep-24 04:19 PM] laaxus#0000
unlike lse


[07-Sep-24 04:19 PM] laaxus#0000
(tho I admit the roi at bid price for LTA isn't great)


[07-Sep-24 04:20 PM] razenpok#0000
LBH has probably the best balance between liquidity and profit


[07-Sep-24 04:20 PM] tanda#0000
when it comes to construction mats I generally don't sell at bid prices anymore (thank god)


[07-Sep-24 04:20 PM] tanda#0000
now I just need a bit more buffer so I never buy at ask prices ever again


[07-Sep-24 04:21 PM] razenpok#0000
~~You sell at internal prices instead :kekw: ~~


[07-Sep-24 04:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
wow


[07-Sep-24 04:21 PM] tanda#0000
hey, those are still considered so I make a profit


[07-Sep-24 04:21 PM] tanda#0000
just not a lot

Anyway, thank you again for your offers, I appreciate them a lot :blobheart:

If a certain Rise will reach out promising riches beyond imagination, draw a circle with salt and ask him to retreat to Hephaestus immediately


[07-Sep-24 04:58 PM] farnite#0000
LOL


[07-Sep-24 04:58 PM] tanda#0000
alternatively just accept that one permit is a pretty small price to pay


[07-Sep-24 04:58 PM] tanda#0000
and then draw a circle of salt around the sponsored base

Low profit, but is profit you won't have had for some time otherwise

how much are you paid for edc?


[07-Sep-24 07:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Sponsored bases usually confer full build + repair materials + consumables + a flat weekly rate for permit use....


[07-Sep-24 07:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So, probably not enough.


[07-Sep-24 07:16 PM] avalock#0000
woah that must be a cool rave

How to deal with the logistics of a metallurgy base? Even with a WCB it would still require frequent visits

[08-Sep-24 02:27 PM] tanda#0000
the best advice would definitely be make sure you're set up on a planet with access to the ore that you need


[08-Sep-24 02:27 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm running ALo between Nascent and Vulcan for my smelters. 2 STO is a must in my opinion

I service Deimos once every 5 day as it stands right now

{Reactions}
concern 

[08-Sep-24 02:28 PM] tanda#0000
my ore is more expensive buying from the local market rather than producing it on Nascent


[08-Sep-24 02:28 PM] tanda#0000
but in exchange I have a lot more Carbon too


[08-Sep-24 02:28 PM] igfloz#0000
....and I also made sure I had stock at the smelting base before putting the smelters down


[08-Sep-24 02:28 PM] laaxus#0000
currently, I have 4 ext on deimos, 
priority is things I supply
Then when I run out, I smelt AL


[08-Sep-24 02:30 PM] razenpok#0000
Ok, I guess no way around it, thanks everyone

That‚Äôs a big part of why I‚Äôve never really done metallurgy - not that food production is much better. You just trade weight for bulk


[08-Sep-24 02:31 PM] tanda#0000
Really not a huge issue with import export if you accept that you're only ever going to get ALO off the LM


[08-Sep-24 02:32 PM] razenpok#0000
... but you still need to export


[08-Sep-24 02:32 PM] tanda#0000
yeah! every 5 days


[08-Sep-24 02:32 PM] razenpok#0000
Is it more like 3.9 days due to m3?


[08-Sep-24 02:33 PM] igfloz#0000
I could maybe help you out with ALO. I don't want to over extend myself as I am already feeding another person


[08-Sep-24 02:33 PM] tanda#0000
no worries, I don't have channels for that because it's such a shipping headache I don't want to pawn it off on anyone else either


[08-Sep-24 02:35 PM] igfloz#0000
well, if you looking for some one day, ping me, I've normally got 2K @ Deimos


[08-Sep-24 02:35 PM] tanda#0000
I suppose? I don't watch the clock on that closesly, just how much AL is there. When it hits 1k I send a ship

basically ties up a ship almost full time, right?


[08-Sep-24 02:40 PM] igfloz#0000
yes it kinda does, but I use the ship to transport GRN  >> Nascent for a customer, ALO >> Deimos / Vulcan, so it's not entirely a waste. I make profits üôÇ


[08-Sep-24 02:40 PM] tanda#0000
that's good. I have the same trade route, but instead I ship back C from Nascent


[08-Sep-24 02:41 PM] laaxus#0000
or be like me and send a ship every day


[08-Sep-24 02:41 PM] tanda#0000

@tanda I just read the server info and ADI has no IG corp, but there is something called CULT.

yes, it's a small little group focused around Elon


[08-Sep-24 04:44 PM] tanda#0000
there's an HQ there that boosts our bases on that planet, it helps with the PG project but otherwise is just a cool tag


[08-Sep-24 04:45 PM] tanda#0000
it's just an extension of ADI as a whole


[08-Sep-24 04:45 PM] nanacheesecake#0000

[08-Sep-24 04:48 PM] jvaler#0000
yup
we like to keep project creation and management as open as possible, so anyone is welcome to create their own projects.

[08-Sep-24 05:05 PM] avalock#0000
oooo


[08-Sep-24 05:06 PM] avalock#0000
2k/2k might be good for 3rd ship for me


[08-Sep-24 05:06 PM] avalock#0000
cause it would be the one that runs from KI401d to aceland


[08-Sep-24 05:06 PM] avalock#0000
and i could have a stop at elon along the way for resource extraction


[08-Sep-24 05:07 PM] tanda#0000
oh definitely. two WCBs should be enough for the minerals, as those are mostly a lot closer in than 401d is

I am sure some traders will be on it like they are on MCG


[09-Sep-24 08:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
this looks like a good trade deal


[09-Sep-24 08:18 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
This shortage started at BEN actually, the spike at ANT is likely from the complete lack of supply there and traders trying to fix it there. So it's not just trading, it's a supply shortage. I know that at least 7 H bases were built in BEN this week though so... that's up to 8-9k H/d at least


[09-Sep-24 08:19 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Should correct soon, especially in ANT


[09-Sep-24 08:20 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm also trying to become a MM for H at BEN too, which will hopefully help prevent this in the future...

Those aren't corrections, unless 50 newbros have dropped on Katoa. Long-term players are dropping off like flies --- it's not funny, even though it kinda is.


[09-Sep-24 06:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's also the consideration of "THE" inflationary economy, which we're all experiencing atm. View the most recent economy reports. Add the true values from Liquidity sinks, (should be negative), with the Liquidity taps (should be positive). 

Those liquidity taps will continue... Ad infinitum. Some newbros may shove a stop-gap plug to collect some B-fab / fuel revenues... But there's a thorough prioritisation on the EDCC/IDC, such that..... **prices will will still go up, on the basic stuff**


[10-Sep-24 01:16 AM] cptboby#0000
I would love to,but i have neither the capital nor the ships to do it yet


[10-Sep-24 01:21 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, if you don't have the capital, you should not invest in it


[10-Sep-24 01:21 AM] laaxus#0000
It's a bubble, I'm quitte sure the market is correcting

WHAT IF
They are introducing a new kind of H-based fuel => demand for VCB ships goes up => more ships are built => production of everything else leading to ships also gets stimulated => people produce less IDC/EDC for more profits elsewhere

[10-Sep-24 12:49 PM] kahetabi#0000
Looking for corp on Harmonia


[10-Sep-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
BRM only base makes 521/d on 840c....
16 CHP on REA needs 917.14... if you add 1 EXT to the CHP with 1 expert that cuts it down to 884.63... import 364 BRM/d or get a second base to support you
12 CHP / 4 EXT would need 567/d, yield 274 REA/d import 46 BRM/d
or 4/2 expert would be 517/d, yield 255 REA/d


[10-Sep-24 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend playing a few weeks before joining a corp


[10-Sep-24 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
they have different view on how to play


[10-Sep-24 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
you should join a like minded corp

well


[10-Sep-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
a corp with HQ on harmonia would boost their output

ADI does have a corp, but its HQ is on Elon to boost output there


[10-Sep-24 01:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think 90 is a fair price... since it's not traded daily and you don't use that much of it


[10-Sep-24 01:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's like ~5% of cost to make a REP


[10-Sep-24 01:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
INS in the other hand is ~80% of the cost


[10-Sep-24 01:29 PM] laaxus#0000
For now, I believe 80 is fair enough


[10-Sep-24 01:29 PM] laaxus#0000

doing a Chem COGC might be a good idea or it might be a terrible one. Definitely the EXT base needs the Resource Extraction COGC in order to get closer to 1:1

is it sustainable? no


[11-Sep-24 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
but it will pay itself off fast, and then you can just do DW


[11-Sep-24 08:31 PM] jvaler#0000
CX items still come from somewhere
and CX agri can't be relied on for large quantities


[11-Sep-24 08:31 PM] jvaler#0000
and then DW price crashes...

I have definitely strongly considered the FP base due to the short term profit of it, but then again I've considered a lot of things for Phobos

go to BEN area of influence. Etherwind, Proxion, Milliways.


[13-Sep-24 12:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you could also go to SE-110 (Thalassa) --- we already mentioned it, like 5j from ANT


[13-Sep-24 12:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Could also go to FK-794 (Boucher system -- same arrangement as Thalassa; 1 RIG base, 1 HYF base, 1 FP base --- but there is a deficiency since we all need another FP base around both of those latter systems).


[13-Sep-24 12:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Else, we're exporting excess agri surplus to somewhere else.


[13-Sep-24 12:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
unless you are totally strapped for capital and opposed to taking loans, set up a HYF base. (you do need FRMs if you need HER). Demeter is good for farming in ANT space. Thalassa as shown above.


[13-Sep-24 12:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
ISA is closer.


[13-Sep-24 12:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
These distances do make a difference, if you're running HYFs.

[13-Sep-24 01:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or Phobos, or Heph. >:O


[13-Sep-24 01:02 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm making a shit ton of money of out heiph and phobos, no way I'd put fp on them


[13-Sep-24 01:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ye, I wasn't ever going to plant down electronics on Phobos, so I just reverted it to an FP base. üôÇ


[13-Sep-24 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
works


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] jvaler#0000
what is with these phobos FP people


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] jvaler#0000
is norwick not good enough for you? smh


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
norwick is far


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
too far


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
we need a gateway


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
i need 2 per HYF base. üòõ


[13-Sep-24 01:05 PM] jvaler#0000
too far from what?


[13-Sep-24 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
doesn't HYF produce less than 2 base ?


[13-Sep-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
it's like 12-16hrs from ANT, it's not that bad at all


[13-Sep-24 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
or do you mix FIM and MEA with it ?


[13-Sep-24 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, but I have to supply it about once every 2 day


[13-Sep-24 01:07 PM] laaxus#0000
meaning I have a LCB being 50% of the time on norwick, going back and forth


[13-Sep-24 01:08 PM] jvaler#0000
from harmonia?


[13-Sep-24 01:08 PM] jvaler#0000
harmonia doesn't produce 0.5 LCB of agri per day


[13-Sep-24 01:08 PM] jvaler#0000
or are you buying water to make DW too


[13-Sep-24 01:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The ratios that I build for... make for 1 HYF base --> 2 FP bases.... They usually include some form of water extraction, so I'm also making DW + COF to buffer out local consumption, to cut down on the weekly upkeep requirements.


[13-Sep-24 01:11 PM] laaxus#0000
I don't have a HYF base yet, I'm supplying from ant


[13-Sep-24 01:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm sold on the SE-751b FP planet proposition. It's not too bad. You drop the ADM, where as I drop the COGC/LM/ a handful of WARs + 2-3 of SSTs

The upkeep will be extremely minimal --- we just ship in a ton of stuff, keep it in WAR, and just keep plugging. 

I'll start to send over the PPS stuff over the next few weeks, and will base-drop in > 45 days. üôÇ


[13-Sep-24 01:21 PM] laaxus#0000
@scintillating_iridescence @archielvahr why not turn se-110e into another FI planet ?


[13-Sep-24 01:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
FP?


[13-Sep-24 01:21 PM] laaxus#0000
food industries


[13-Sep-24 01:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
gaseous


[13-Sep-24 01:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
AEF > MCG --- they're both + INS


[13-Sep-24 01:22 PM] laaxus#0000
yet still less cost for a fp base than se-110a

[13-Sep-24 01:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I dropped on SE-110a, since I have 6k t/m3 logistics, dedicated, in-system, daily.


[13-Sep-24 01:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yes, 6 STLs. Stupid? Maybe. But I'd be paying out x3 as much for dedicated FTLs to service other planets, outside of system.


[13-Sep-24 01:24 PM] laaxus#0000
are STL ship that much cheaper than FTL ?


[13-Sep-24 01:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
basically 1/3 cost?


[13-Sep-24 01:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
or less


[13-Sep-24 01:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh yeah, they're crazy cheap in comparison


[13-Sep-24 01:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
@scintillating_iridescence I'm also open to dropping FP on 110e if that makes more sense, I haven't run the numbers on if it would be cheaper to colonize 751b or 110e


[13-Sep-24 01:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lets run the numbers... I've pre-built dedicated shipping capacity for my agri system @ SE-110?

[13-Sep-24 01:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But, on previous operational experience at FK-794 (Boucher).... it's literally not much of an issue.


[13-Sep-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The market availability of AEFs would be of foremost concern, since I don't make them.... Do you?


[13-Sep-24 01:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
nope üòÑ


[13-Sep-24 01:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
but there is a reasonable supply on the CX - about 5k at ANT for below 3.5k a piece


[13-Sep-24 01:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
SE-110d is extremely viable, on a logistics view.

SE-110d MCG + SEA + INS + RE COGC....... We're better suited at the other site.


[13-Sep-24 01:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
so 751b it is? üôÇ


[13-Sep-24 01:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
apparently


[13-Sep-24 01:31 PM] laaxus#0000
why se 751b ?


[13-Sep-24 01:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Least cost option....


[13-Sep-24 01:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
MCG + INS, compared to all of the other extremes around the space


[13-Sep-24 01:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
+ no current COGC.


[13-Sep-24 01:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
and reasonably close to SE-110b since I have extra space there for more HYF üòÑ


[13-Sep-24 01:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[13-Sep-24 01:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll see if I can put together a bill of materials for SE-751b this evening after work so we can look at the costs for the infrastructure. I'm guessing if I do just the ADM and you're getting COGC, WAR, and 2-3 SST, that's probably not quite 50/50 (i.e. puts most cost on you), but we can figure out the details when you're closer to having a free permit üôÇ


[14-Sep-24 07:55 AM] skyrey#0000
75 days, no loans taken:

I have a base setup that makes 53 000 according to PRUN

All buildings repaired 

~10 days supply at both bases 

My total equity is around 1 150 000 AIC, but I have around 450 000 in grain and carbon stock, which I can easily liquidate at Anteras 




I feel like it is good progress for how casually I am taking the game

[17-Sep-24 10:18 AM] laaxus#0000
however, I would not recommend upgrading until you CANT expand anymore


[17-Sep-24 10:21 AM] manhim#0000
Oh yeah, I'm just looking right now. I'm kind of an overplanner.

yeah, but you're right. Breaching the contract was the escalation

if you haven't written off the product, who the heck breaches a contract when there's open communication

[17-Sep-24 08:45 PM] jcheung#0000
When you breach a contact, you basically say "I'm going to trade your reputation for my cargo"


[17-Sep-24 08:46 PM] tanda#0000
yep, and I think it really should only be done if you're ignored/blocked or the player straight up isn't playing anymore


[17-Sep-24 08:47 PM] jcheung#0000
In my eyes, the shipper isn't a pirate, since they made am effort


[17-Sep-24 08:47 PM] jcheung#0000
The cargo made it to NC1


[17-Sep-24 08:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah


[17-Sep-24 08:47 PM] jcheung#0000
They just didn't have time to deliver


[17-Sep-24 08:48 PM] jcheung#0000
Or was unable to deliver because it was awaiting extension


[17-Sep-24 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000

I get that. I just produce the two things and am feeling mischievous enough to try a similar method to sacrifice short term liquidity for greater profit per unit

it only works if you have tons of liquidity
I would recommend just selling at first

[19-Sep-24 03:25 PM] laaxus#0000
nope, full of debt (good debt tho)


[19-Sep-24 03:26 PM] igfloz#0000
I took the ADI grant to get me spun up (Harmonia) - but no further loans


[19-Sep-24 03:29 PM] realharvey#0000
loans make a big difference in terms of growth


[19-Sep-24 03:29 PM] igfloz#0000
To be clear, the ADI grant allowed me to fully fund Harmonia and also start burn items @ Hephaestus (slowly) - I now have bases on Nascent, Vulcan, Nike etc.... so I'm not hoarding the $$, I have spent a fair amount.

It's a sandbox game. Set your own rules/limits etc. Play it how you want to play it. I've done it without any loans, because I want to be able to measure my choices... decisions. If you can just borrow (or be gifted) lots and lots of $... it sort of trivializes the importance of the choices you make that will save 10 AIC here, 1k AIC there etc.

Can i ask where the margins come from in this game?


[21-Sep-24 03:46 AM] cruelcoin#0000
As in, (excluding giga companies like amazon etc), in a healthy market with healthy competition, markets tend towards 7-10% profit.
Companies compete away eachothers margins to that point (ideally).


[21-Sep-24 03:47 AM] cruelcoin#0000
But the margins on my Ration production for example are way in excess of that.


[21-Sep-24 03:53 AM] evov#0000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you're talking about valuation, not profit, when you're referring to the 7-10% profit for companies?

I think mostly, in both rl and in prun, the question comes down to.... How much return can I get on my money +consider risk +consider cognitive load/time availability.

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[21-Sep-24 03:55 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I think it is net profit for that %.
It's only logical too that companies will spring up to seize margin, to the point of loss of attractiveness.


[21-Sep-24 03:56 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Could it be the sign of an aging/maturing player base that's moving towards higher end production?


[21-Sep-24 03:56 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Thus reducing production on the entry level?


[21-Sep-24 03:59 AM] evov#0000
Well, there are limitations in the game. We can't have 100 bases. Bases are limited in size. There are limited developed planets where you can build bases. So we're forced to choose between this thing, or that thing.


[21-Sep-24 04:02 AM] evov#0000
I would say.... there's 2 primary measures of profitability in the game.... 2 ways people measure how juicy a base/building/production line etc is.

1. RoI - How quickly does a thing pay for itself.
2. $/Area - How much $ per day can you squeeze out of a permit.


[21-Sep-24 04:04 AM] evov#0000
When newish - (less than 20 permits say) - RoI tends to be the most important thing. You just want to be growing and expanding and building more bases more faster.

After 20ish permits - the permit cost starts being more expensive than the cost of building the base. At this point, it's generally a bit more important to maximize the $ you can squeeze out of each permit each day, rather than trying to multiply money faster.

Makes sense, thank you.


[21-Sep-24 04:10 AM] skyrey#0000
The answer is a lot simpler:

1 - under population of the world. There are numerous potential industries and niches in the market - but only a few thousand players in total. 

2 - High paced production and the ability to change the entire production line in a day at a minuscule comparable cost allows active players to be very efficient. With this advantage over reality players can be significantly more efficient

[21-Sep-24 04:11 AM] skyrey#0000
Thus high profit margins


[21-Sep-24 04:11 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I'm trying to set up PRUN in such a way that it doesn't mark water as a profit item where i produce it, nor as a cost in the base i ship it to to be consumed.


[21-Sep-24 04:11 AM] skyrey#0000
It is a profit item as if you later on use it yourself. That profit from one base is taken on as a cost of production in the other


[21-Sep-24 04:12 AM] cruelcoin#0000
But to keep it level in terms of same value in/out, i should set my cx preferences for water to be average for my local market?


[21-Sep-24 04:13 AM] skyrey#0000
I for example grow Grain and use it to make Carbon. But my water and grain production outpaces my Carbon intake. Thus I sell the excess as additional profit


[21-Sep-24 04:15 AM] skyrey#0000
Well. If water was a sell of 100 and a bid of 90. By supplying the water directly to yourself rather than selling it to the CX at 90. You do not have to pay the 100 per unit of water for your second base. Thus this vertical production system saves you 10 spread per unit of water used


[21-Sep-24 04:17 AM] skyrey#0000
If you set it up average, it will not account for you supplying yourself at more favourable prices. Bypassing players who engage in commodity arbitrage


[21-Sep-24 04:17 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I see.
So 110c set water sell price to cx bid, and 110b set water buy price to cx bid.


[21-Sep-24 04:17 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Makes sense, thank you.


[21-Sep-24 04:21 AM] skyrey#0000
If we look at Anteras CX:

If you sell water, you get 36 per unit.

If you buy water, you pay 44.80 per unit.

If you were to sell your water from one base and buy the water for another, then what you are asking about makes sense.

But because you produce the water yourself, you are able to sell it to yourself at 36 per unit. Saving you 8.80 per unit


[21-Sep-24 04:38 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Ok. Bear with me please.
My thinking then is:
- Empire buy price is the local cx buy price (assuming i'm buying everything i don't produce myself).
- Empire sell price is the local cx sell price (assumes i sell everything i'm not shipping to another planet)
- To cover where water is being sent to another base of mine, i set that planets water sell price to cx sell.
- that receiving planets water buy price is set to cx sell for the cheaper rate?

As in screenshot? Have i understood you correctly?

[21-Sep-24 11:20 AM] jcheung#0000
ship speeds are constrained by a couple different things, i don't know all of them, but here are a few...
ship mass, engine thrust, squishy tolerance (g-factor)
the starter ship, engine thrust is high enough that even at max ship mass, you wouldn't survive at max thrust... so it throttles down

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Sep-24 11:20 AM] jcheung#0000
if you install a high-g seat, then the limitation switches over to ship mass because you can burn harder

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Sep-24 11:25 AM] kynadre#0000
And then at some point, the ship can't accelerate to 10g due to ship mass anyway, like when it's fully loaded and a larger cargo bay had been installed, so the actual blocker becomes engines if those high-g seats are to have any effect xD

Just like im going ANT to Deimos and Nike so like is it worth chaining these in a certain order

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Sep-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
It can be, i do something similar sometimes.
It mostly depends on what cargo needs to be moved. In your example, it would be very easy to say.... for example, pack consumables for both deimos and nike, then pack feedstock (ore, flx, o, etc) for deimos.
Once there, pick up whatever AL/FE or other materials you made and head to nike with nike consumables and the refined metals.

You likely will still need to make some dedicated runs for that, but it makes more sense than backtracking the refined metal to ANT since deimos is between ANT and nike


[21-Sep-24 12:16 PM] martinswdev#0000
Yeah so is there a tool that will show me that deimos is between the two, other than working that out on the map ?>

also consider that a, b, c, d, e is the progression from middle of the system outward, though ofc. there's orbits to account for


[21-Sep-24 12:40 PM] kynadre#0000
so whatever's near the middle of the system takes your (with starter ship, rough estimated) usual 100ish STL fuel to fly into from outside, but once you're already in the middle, it's really easy to hop between planets next to each other

So Snorka just joined the APEX server, like a few hours ago... I'd say wait 1-2 weeks, before you use Luxury consumables (PWO/COF+).


[21-Sep-24 12:50 PM] kynadre#0000
tbh the profit bump it gave me after my first shipment made it justifiable for me like on the 3rd day of production... had and made just enough from starter that I could build a 2nd production building and grab the luxuries


[21-Sep-24 12:50 PM] kynadre#0000
was a significant bump up having the LUX vs. not

COF is a bit pricey per day after all but the padded overalls (PWO) aren't bad at all


[21-Sep-24 12:52 PM] tanda#0000
PWO are cheap and very slow to consume, I recommend them. COF is expensive


[21-Sep-24 12:52 PM] kynadre#0000
definitely never worth going to market just to pick up 1-2 things on their own, fuel costs too expensive... pick them up when you make a substantial trip


[21-Sep-24 12:52 PM] martinswdev#0000
interesting, do we have any math for the fuel usage for weigth / distance etc from devs ?

[21-Sep-24 12:53 PM] kynadre#0000
I generally figure if I have to fly into the Antares 1 from another system it's going to cost me like 3,000 round-trip for the STL fuel costs


[21-Sep-24 12:54 PM] kynadre#0000
so I want that trip to count when I make it, be making a decent sized sale, purchase, to have me set for a week+

that's been my take anyway, the couple of days I've been here and poking at things


[21-Sep-24 01:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
generally, 150 SF / 150 FF, for longer distance flights. If you're just dropping something off in orbit, then it's like 75 SF. None of this makes any mention to the orbital states, when you take off. Sometimes you'll get lucky.. Other times you get shafted.

that'd be interesting to observe orbital states over the course of a day and see how that impacts fuel usage leaving a system...


[21-Sep-24 01:14 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm assuming the game doesn't let you park at the edge of a system for a while to wait for a planet to get closer, or in the end it'd cost you more fuel since you'd have to stop and then get going from a stop again


[21-Sep-24 01:18 PM] tanda#0000

I've been wanting to get someone to screen record some MS (system map) stuff, for like a whole day at least, just to get some intervals, to be plugged into some orbital equations... But no dice.

Molp + friends just need to drop me the orbital functions/tables, since reverse-engineering optimal STL slight times, between in-system planets, is just a complete PITA.

[21-Sep-24 01:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I mean, MAYBE, STL travel in ANT, would be more viable than in BEN, based on the orbits themselves... But people don't play this game for that; they need stuff transported, whenever they deem it so --- thus its best to bet on the best metrics (FSE stl engines), and simply hope for the best.


[21-Sep-24 04:26 PM] evov#0000
I recognise that shipping can be a constraint for people. But generally, I refuse to accept shipping contracts because there's no way to know if they're auto supplied or not. As in... they may not have the stuff ready to go when my ship is actually there with empty space. Buying the stuff on planet and picking it up myself is just easier.

[21-Sep-24 04:41 PM] evov#0000
Not everywhere has warehouses. I feel like shipping contracts should function like an escrow thing, like the way CX sales work.


[21-Sep-24 05:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
From what I've seen, shipping contracts have defaulted to FSE fuel use rates + depreciation value... They're not paying for the premium of service, rather they're defaulting to the least common denominator of some sort of contractually assured servicing... I'm not buying into that at all. Evov has his fair points as well. 

You've basically got a propaganda machine going on.. "Ohh hey.. it's extra income, I might as well just take it"... Well half of the galaxy is assuming people will do such that, and they're basing their rates off of such... 

This has been going on for years, so it's less of a gripe, and more of an observation.

However, a single person can only do so much to combat such trends. Efficient markets theorem? Maybe.

if the intent is that a player picks something up on the way to do something of their own at the same time, and they both fit, they make sense. If it's the only thing someone does with their ships, it appears many are breakeven at best and that's bad form

yeah, its using pegboard... but I wonder like.... is there something better maybe :thinking2:


[21-Sep-24 08:20 PM] avalock#0000
I guess you want even vacuuming nvm


[21-Sep-24 08:20 PM] avalock#0000
I was thinking uneven vacuum holes


[21-Sep-24 08:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh

[21-Sep-24 08:21 PM] avalock#0000
the stupid ideas are gonna come out now


[21-Sep-24 08:21 PM] avalock#0000
I gotta hide them before someone comes in and tells me what to actually do so I don't mess up, but then I get spiteful and do the wrong thing anyways cause I'm a silly dog


[21-Sep-24 08:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Peg board


[21-Sep-24 08:22 PM] avalock#0000
yeah! pegboard prolly fine


[21-Sep-24 08:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And some 2x4s


[21-Sep-24 08:22 PM] avalock#0000
yeeeee


[21-Sep-24 08:23 PM] avalock#0000
I could prolly get some stuff printed out too


[21-Sep-24 08:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And then some aluminum channel pieces or something to hold plastic and make seal with pegboard


[21-Sep-24 08:23 PM] avalock#0000
and like I feel my gf would maybe end up using this too :3


[21-Sep-24 08:23 PM] avalock#0000

Bed leveling is the pits. You might need to use AL tape to fix the lows

I've also been looking into building a NAS with an ITX board (I have a 2u case with an ITX layout, and want to use it)

But its been difficult to find what I need lmao


[21-Sep-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
decided to look at super thermally conductive tapes


[21-Sep-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
and one roll of one inch wide, 36 yard long for $150 was not what i was expecting

[21-Sep-24 09:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
if you end up building a NAS, let me know what software you end up using (if software is the right term). i've been kicking around the idea of a small NAS for file transfers and stuff but never really got around to it


[21-Sep-24 09:11 PM] avalock#0000

that's the linux distro with the built in docker stuff, right?


[21-Sep-24 09:17 PM] avalock#0000
Oh yeah HAL would be better to ask, I'm just doing silly projects lmao

I have a small server with proxmox on it, and that's how I run most of my homelab stuff


[21-Sep-24 09:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
so I think casaOS would replace that more than handle NAS stuff


[21-Sep-24 09:19 PM] avalock#0000
:o

there is a janky way to set up raid for CasaOS as well but I think Raid support is coming to CasaOS

klipper is still better than marlin or other


[21-Sep-24 09:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
so would this be running a NAS in CasaOS on a seperate machine? if I were to set up a NAS with it, that is

yeah definetly, its just she brought up an issue and I was like "What if Pi clusters"

yeee, I didn't till now :P


[21-Sep-24 09:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could set up CasaOS on your current machine


[21-Sep-24 10:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
in a VM? or would it replace proxmox?


[21-Sep-24 10:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
that probably also tells you my level of knowledge on this üòÑ


[21-Sep-24 10:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i think you could run it in proxmox


[21-Sep-24 10:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but you could replace proxmox with it


[21-Sep-24 10:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
CasaOS is basically just a dressed up Portainer running on debian


[22-Sep-24 02:24 AM] pxlfox.#0000
‚úÖ  construction materials and supplies are bought. Great call to look for #internal-offers, @tanda. PrunPlanner said I would roughly need 1 mil for construction and supply, but it did cost me just around 600.000 AIC, so 400.000 left to use for something else... just have to think about a good next step.

My ships will probably need 24h so send all to Deimos. Production should be up and running on Mo or Tue and then we are starting to flood the market with more AL!


[22-Sep-24 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
At what percentage should I repair my ships/buildings?


[22-Sep-24 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I saw people mentioning around 80%


[22-Sep-24 06:18 AM] evov#0000
That's my understanding.. that you only start to notice it slowing down after 80%. But... I'm going off what other people say as well, so don't have any firm numbers or proof for you.


[22-Sep-24 06:31 AM] laaxus#0000
@razenpok I just observed something


[22-Sep-24 06:31 AM] laaxus#0000
It's a fact that ANT is more expensive than BEN, in almost everything

[22-Sep-24 06:33 AM] laaxus#0000
the expected behavior would have been for the price to go down


[22-Sep-24 06:33 AM] laaxus#0000
yet it does not


[22-Sep-24 06:33 AM] laaxus#0000
does it mean that people does not import from ben ?


[22-Sep-24 06:33 AM] evov#0000
I do


[22-Sep-24 06:34 AM] laaxus#0000
yes some people do, but it seems like the imports are not enough to affect the fx price


[22-Sep-24 06:34 AM] evov#0000
I don't use the FX market though.


[22-Sep-24 06:39 AM] evov#0000
The FX traded volume there, 750k... over what time frame is that? The last 3 days?


[22-Sep-24 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[22-Sep-24 06:46 AM] evov#0000
That's a very small % of the trade between the 2 cx's. I think the only thing the FX market is representative of, is the net sum of people who like using the FX market.


[22-Sep-24 06:55 AM] evov#0000
Since I've been tracking my CX activity - From this friday going back 41 days...
My CX Sales at Benten - 21mil
My CX Buys at Benten - 29mil

People will often use MM products (IDC/EDC/CBL etc) to transfer cash between CX's. That far exceeds whatever volume the fx market does imo


[22-Sep-24 07:01 AM] evov#0000
ANT and MOR are typically more expensive for most of the consumables and things like that. Compared to HRT and BEN, ANT and MOR are generally just more highly developed. We make more high end stuff here.

But the price difference in consumes / fuel etc isn't massive.  e.g. -> Consumes price index for each of the areas.

Drones are used for higher-end building maintenance, right?


[22-Sep-24 11:36 AM] tanda#0000
they can be used for some really bad upkeep for higher end POPI. I'm looking at SRD ship repair drones though


[22-Sep-24 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
There's a fee for fx. Most people trade direct 1:1


[22-Sep-24 11:45 AM] laaxus#0000
fee is negligible honestly


[22-Sep-24 11:46 AM] laaxus#0000
out of a 1M trade, you lose 1k


[22-Sep-24 11:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yep, for SDP, EMC, and HOS upkeeps. You're never really going to see their use, anytime soon, since Building such POPI is prohibitively expensive, as compared to the cheaper alternatives, and you have price floors for the drones as well, due to MM policies.


[22-Sep-24 11:46 AM] laaxus#0000
it's like 10 minutes of profits for me


[22-Sep-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
I turn over about 1-2M on the FX per week


[22-Sep-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs just smaller trades and people who can‚Äôt be bothered to find someone to trade 1:1


[22-Sep-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000
I wished I could directly buy from another cx in AIC

without having to manually convert on the fx


[22-Sep-24 12:08 PM] avalock#0000

just put like a small exchange fee or something

[22-Sep-24 12:09 PM] laaxus#0000
wdym, it would increase FX traders profit


[22-Sep-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh, I thought you just meant directly through the game, not placing orders on the FX automagically


[22-Sep-24 12:11 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, what I said was, let me see the price in AIC, and let the system automatically put a fx order and convert


[22-Sep-24 12:11 PM] laaxus#0000

Does anyone remember the story about a person who bought up all the carbon from Hortus on the first day of the universe for like 1000 each to haul to Moria?

can someone explain to me what's a ticker and what's a buffer in apex?


[23-Sep-24 11:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
My guess is - if I open a new window and enter a command, what I get shown is a ticker.


[23-Sep-24 11:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
fixing it to a specific screen is a buffer?


[23-Sep-24 11:43 AM] razenpok#0000
buffer is any floating window in apex


[23-Sep-24 11:43 AM] razenpok#0000
But people also call any docked tile as buffer also


[23-Sep-24 11:43 AM] razenpok#0000
Ticker is a material abbreviation, for example ticker of Iron is FE


[23-Sep-24 11:44 AM] razenpok#0000
A ticker can have a CX id in it, for example AL.AI1


[23-Sep-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000

irl, ticker is used in exchanges, like a ticker for Apple company shares is AAPL

Like, @pxlfox.  your company ticker is BIT


[23-Sep-24 11:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000

it once was a buffer, and no longer is. It has been blessed to remain permanent... until the game forgets you did so and reverts it, so you have to do it every time you log in ... thus it is still a buffer until you whack it with a hammer to become permanent :pepebless:

you say FLX slows it down, it actually technically doesn't


[23-Sep-24 12:44 PM] jcheung#0000
if you look at output, the time per AL base is 4 hrs per AL
FLX recipe is closer to 3.7 hrs per AL

it uses MediaWiki, a free software. I setup a fresh copy on my personal server and using it there.


[23-Sep-24 12:44 PM] jcheung#0000
so it's both faster and uses less input materials


[23-Sep-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000

BSE isn't terrible, but basically anything else you produce in the same building will make you more money.


[23-Sep-24 05:04 PM] evov#0000
If you believe you can make good profits, selling it below 1650, then yes, you'll probably be able to sell a lot since there's virtually no competition.

All of the price models have their own issues. There is no "correct" choice. But you should understand the pros/cons of whatever option you're using.
Time averaged data (e.g. PP7D_AI1 ) falls down a bit when there's sharp movements in the AI market. It means you'll be late to the party to realize you're losing money or making the wrong thing etc.

does anyone know how consumable affect the efficiency of production? Pioneers need 3 basic and 2 luxury materials. If you provide everything you get a 100% efficiency, if you only provide basic ones, they cap at around 70/80%, if I remember correctly. What happens, when all or just a few basic materials are missing? Can people leave your company, if you don't provide the required materials?


[24-Sep-24 01:09 AM] laaxus#0000

They only leave if there isn't enough workers of that type ln the planet


[24-Sep-24 02:16 AM] jcheung#0000
And that starts subtracting from the people who have the highest usage first


[24-Sep-24 04:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I hate the fact, that CUO is so hard to get. At the same time it triggers the gamer in me, because he sees it as a challenge not many are willing to accept ü•¥ it‚Äôs going to financially ruin me to setup a production line, just so I can brag with: I‚Äôm making copper üòÇ.


[24-Sep-24 04:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or it makes me rich, but I doubt that possibility


[24-Sep-24 04:33 AM] laaxus#0000
The only issue with cuo is the shipping


[24-Sep-24 04:33 AM] evov#0000
Buy CUO from wherever it's cheapest, send it to your smelters, smelt, profit.


[24-Sep-24 04:33 AM] laaxus#0000
you need 1 cuo ext base, 2 cu sme bases and then you produce 600 cu a day


[24-Sep-24 04:33 AM] laaxus#0000
(and fill the need for the whole galaxy)


[24-Sep-24 04:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, shipping, logistics, relatively low demand


[24-Sep-24 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I believe the low demand comes from high price


[24-Sep-24 04:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But if you lower the price, your profit is eaten up by the shipping


[24-Sep-24 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
If you own the cuo and sme base, you could sell the CU for 1600


[24-Sep-24 04:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[24-Sep-24 04:39 AM] evov#0000
And that's assuming that the people building the gateways will source their stuff from the CX rather than just building a production line themselves for it.


[24-Sep-24 04:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could make CBS with your excess CU and sell it to the MM


[24-Sep-24 04:41 AM] laaxus#0000
but that defeat the whole goal


[24-Sep-24 04:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But other then that, CU seams to be a dead end and for that way to hard to get


[24-Sep-24 04:42 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm yearning for people to use the cx rather than building their whole economy vertical

Refer to my purchases of copper/copper ore over the last 40 days.
CBS does use copper, but not THAT much

At the end of the day, do what makes you happy. Build, make, expand etc. I do think demand for CUO will go up. I'm not sure if it'll go up enough to require an extra 300 CU per day

ROI = Output - Input?


[24-Sep-24 04:55 AM] laaxus#0000
ROI = number of days you expect the ship to be paid for itself

[24-Sep-24 04:58 AM] evov#0000
Get fuel costs from the CX. Work out fuel costs. Add a bit for repairs (I have no idea how to cleanly calculate repair costs). And then add on whatever the capital cost of the ship is worth for a day.


[24-Sep-24 04:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Thanks üòä


[24-Sep-24 04:59 AM] evov#0000
Opinion's vary - but I'd say a ship like that is worth 30k per day.


[24-Sep-24 04:59 AM] laaxus#0000
The issue is this strategy is that storage is free


[24-Sep-24 05:00 AM] laaxus#0000
I could technically produce CU for 600 and be the sole supplier of the galaxy


[24-Sep-24 05:00 AM] evov#0000
Storage on the CX is free


[24-Sep-24 05:00 AM] laaxus#0000
but then the rich player will just buy my production and store 2 years of use

[24-Sep-24 05:00 AM] laaxus#0000

[24-Sep-24 06:07 AM] laaxus#0000

[24-Sep-24 06:07 AM] laaxus#0000
you should smelt the cuo and ship the cu


[24-Sep-24 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Since prices are better?


[24-Sep-24 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But then again, I need logistic capacity


[24-Sep-24 06:08 AM] evov#0000
Since total demand for it is lower. Doing a half half base - you miss out on efficiency. But... you don't risk over-supplying the market like crazy.


[24-Sep-24 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I know it‚Äôs less then optimal


[24-Sep-24 06:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
True - and saving on shipping


[24-Sep-24 06:10 AM] evov#0000
Maybe. Depends where it is. Still need to ship the CU back and the O out there. Do what makes you happy, but I strongly advise to stay away from logistics heavy project until you're more established.


[24-Sep-24 06:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I know, just thinking


[24-Sep-24 06:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Maybe setup intermediate bases I use later for CU smelting - dunno. Have to think about it


[24-Sep-24 06:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Shipping cu as much easier than shipping cuo


[24-Sep-24 06:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Iirc


[24-Sep-24 06:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But CU is heavier, or are we talking about price / mass


[24-Sep-24 06:13 AM] evov#0000
But that's like saying - It's easier to deadlift something than benchpress it! .. yeah, good point, but we're trying to move a tractor, so just wait till the towtruck gets here?


[24-Sep-24 06:15 AM] laaxus#0000
You're under valuing the cost of a ship


[24-Sep-24 06:16 AM] laaxus#0000
A ship is from 4 to 6 M depending on how much you are ready to wait


[24-Sep-24 06:16 AM] laaxus#0000
A low shipping base truly has value


[24-Sep-24 06:17 AM] laaxus#0000
But a cuo base would require a dedicated WCB


[24-Sep-24 06:18 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
While CU might be attractive... You're still looking at a surplus market for it on the CX. It's an intermediate product, with no immediate-end use customer on the other side of any sales transaction. You're better off redoubling on vertical integration with that metal, at least on the metallurgical side, since it'll cut down on overall logistical requirements...

And the end-use | retail markets for any of those CU derivative products are niche, and have little sales turnover on a daily/weekly cycle.

[24-Sep-24 06:26 AM] evov#0000
Here's your path to getting the copper ore base you want - 
Figuire out what it'll cost you.  ( you'll want 3 x WCB ships to handle the volume/distance) I can deliver that to you by the end of the week if you've got the $$ for it. Your base, will cost you 1.5mil + some amount of consumables. I'd suggest at least a couple weeks.. might take time for your CUO to sell.

So maybe allow 2mil for the base+consumes. And the ships are 5.6mil each.

So you'll want an 18.8mil loan. Have a chat to some of the loan providers and find out what that looks like.

You could get away with 2 ships... if you crank the fuel sliders to full all the time.


[24-Sep-24 06:30 AM] laaxus#0000
Your best bet is to sell it at hortus then put LM offers to ship it to ant


[24-Sep-24 06:30 AM] laaxus#0000
Loans are at 3% a week at best


[24-Sep-24 06:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Some are better than that... You just need to give out some really good reasons as to why you need capital injections, to boost ADI projects, or ANT CX supply side prospects.


[24-Sep-24 06:31 AM] laaxus#0000
To buy 3 WCB just for one base is an awful investment


[24-Sep-24 06:33 AM] evov#0000
Just to put it into perspective - you can get your first 20 permits unlocked for less than 12mil


[24-Sep-24 06:33 AM] evov#0000
20x whatever cheap ass low margin janky base you can put together will earn a lot lot lot lot lot more than whatever you're thinking of doing with copper


[24-Sep-24 06:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Most peeps are getting seriously dicked around permits 6-->8, since they only have starters... If they meet the WCB upgrade options... Okay they might just get to permit 10-->12 without issues...

[24-Sep-24 06:38 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I've done better. Fully funded 1 player, up to like 12 HQ permits, with x2 WCB upgrades, as free grants, since I know they were going to have issues, at any time, without them, either on capital injections, or shipping requirements... They're currently doing their best to figure things out, with LCB/WCB orders on the long-term.


[24-Sep-24 06:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, they've already paid for those.... But I'm sure all of you are aware that ship building ques.... are tedious...


[24-Sep-24 06:40 AM] evov#0000
No ship building ques here üôÇ


[24-Sep-24 06:43 AM] evov#0000
I think as people progress through the game (as measured by permit count) the metrics and the things that are important change. Below 20... it should all be about logistical and capital efficiency.

20-30 - start refining and cleaning up how you're using permits.. upgrading bases etc.
30+ Start looking towards things that aren't directly tied to permits to make $


[24-Sep-24 06:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Are you multi-permiting you‚Äôre bases?


[24-Sep-24 06:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000

Yes, you can.


[24-Sep-24 06:46 AM] evov#0000
I multi permited at the start. But....buying FTL ships at the start wasn't an option, loans weren't really available etc.


[24-Sep-24 06:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
2 years + ago... loans weren't a thing, unless you were "well connected". The ship building markets/planets were also less developed, if not entirely non-existent. Lots of things have changed within these past 1-2 years.


[24-Sep-24 06:49 AM] evov#0000
Right now, once you've got 4 or 5 bases you could probably afford a loan to buy a new ship


[24-Sep-24 06:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I like the idea of extracting and smelting something else, easier then copper‚Ä¶ maybe LI? (Didn‚Äôt looked at the recipe - dunno if it‚Äôs actually easy)


[24-Sep-24 06:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
FE | AL are your bread + butter. (also their derivatives)


[24-Sep-24 06:51 AM] evov#0000
And the ship upgrade kits are much much cheaper, you could upgrade your 2 starter ships much much earlier than we were able to. So today.... while I think multipermiting is ok... it's no longer optimal.


[24-Sep-24 06:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Those who partake in those more troublesome metals are: 1) your shipbuilding conglomerates, or individuals, and/or 2) your margin farmers (y'all know who they are).

Id say so the CXPX | CXOB market research, and look into the LEAD production stats, for those who partake within individual commodity markets..


[24-Sep-24 06:55 AM] evov#0000
I did FE -> STL on vulcan for a while once upon a time.


[24-Sep-24 06:55 AM] laaxus#0000
Yep, that's what I understood too


[24-Sep-24 06:56 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That should give you a good enough base of info, to sketch up bases, of some sort.


[24-Sep-24 06:56 AM] evov#0000
Crash = Sell lots into it so price goes down? Or Crash = Buy all of it so there's none left?   .... I feel like either meaning works.


[24-Sep-24 06:57 AM] laaxus#0000
Sell


[24-Sep-24 06:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Meh... Marginally better prices at ANT, than anywhere else... The volume differentials are the key.


[24-Sep-24 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
The trader is the only worthwhile bid order


[24-Sep-24 06:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lots of supply from Rise, at fairly low intervals... Should help the relative capacitor industry somewhat.... Pankillers, wtf... Why do you need LI?


[24-Sep-24 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
And no one pay at ask


[24-Sep-24 06:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Once it's Gone ...


[24-Sep-24 06:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Once its gone... The next supply will be coming in soon. üòõ


[24-Sep-24 07:00 AM] laaxus#0000
If you need li, don't h√©sitate to put a bid order


[24-Sep-24 07:03 AM] evov#0000
I use LI

[24-Sep-24 07:09 AM] laaxus#0000
You might buy 100 li a day, but seeing no bid orders doesn't give us, small producers, confidence


[24-Sep-24 07:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmmm....


[24-Sep-24 07:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
LEAD has a production stat... Should it also have a consumption stat?


[24-Sep-24 07:13 AM] evov#0000
You can look at production stats for all the things that use it I guess


[24-Sep-24 07:13 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah. The score #s are kinda vague, though.


[24-Sep-24 07:14 AM] evov#0000
For me it's capacitor banks that I make. Sometimes POW. Capacitor banks are usually limited by production or price of BE though.


[24-Sep-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Would you buy be from the CX or you prefer producing everything yourself


[24-Sep-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Be wise


[24-Sep-24 07:15 AM] evov#0000
Depends on volume.


[24-Sep-24 07:16 AM] evov#0000
I DO produce BE myself. But there's other things those buildings produce that I need also.


[24-Sep-24 07:19 AM] evov#0000
For me at least - I make and use BE/ZR/BOS .. sometimes TA. So I split production between those as needed. If I can buy BE cheap enough, I can make more of the other things.


[24-Sep-24 07:20 AM] laaxus#0000
That's the current state of the order book

[24-Sep-24 07:21 AM] laaxus#0000
an aml base produce 130 be a day


[24-Sep-24 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
would you buy be for 1700 ?


[24-Sep-24 07:23 AM] evov#0000
sometimes


[24-Sep-24 07:23 AM] evov#0000
sometimes more than that. I've paid 2k for BE before.


[24-Sep-24 07:23 AM] evov#0000
It's not ideal but it's still doable.


[24-Sep-24 07:24 AM] laaxus#0000
why not put a bid order and see what happens ?


[24-Sep-24 07:24 AM] laaxus#0000
surely, you have the monetary fund to do it ?


[24-Sep-24 07:24 AM] evov#0000
Well... 1. I don't have infinite money. What I have is being used.
2. I don't need BE right now. My bases that use it have enough to keep them going.


[24-Sep-24 07:25 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lol... Try better ways, at creating instant dump opportunities.


[24-Sep-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, you just bought 50M worth of AL


[24-Sep-24 07:26 AM] evov#0000
That was across all the CX's. Only about 30mil of that was in ant.


[24-Sep-24 07:26 AM] laaxus#0000
when you could have put an AL bid and spare atleast 2-3M


[24-Sep-24 07:27 AM] evov#0000
If you're that interested - this is my current market positions

[24-Sep-24 07:28 AM] laaxus#0000
Oh wow


[24-Sep-24 07:28 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Welp. ADI now has that tool, to splurge their time on.


[24-Sep-24 07:28 AM] laaxus#0000
Did you build that tool ?


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Anyway sorry If I sounded agressive, was not the point


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] evov#0000
Once a week I'll take down all my orders and do a stock take. As at friday (before I bought up AL) this was my holdings

[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That tools is just another FIO end-point derivative... It's been up for years.


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] evov#0000
Not my tool/website no.


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm just trying to understand the behaviors of players


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's better ways to get real-time player action data... But we need a private server instance to constantly pull FIO data....


[24-Sep-24 07:29 AM] evov#0000
I feel like I'm as open and honest about my game/positions as is possible... no secrets here.


[24-Sep-24 07:31 AM] evov#0000
I don't have any secret back door or insider information on anything.
I just use the fio cx prices list. and copy/paste my own details into sheets. I don't run fio or any extensions and play on the steam version.


[24-Sep-24 07:32 AM] evov#0000
So any info or insights I'm able to get... is directly from that info.
The only thing I've got that everyone doesn't have access to... would be my historical trades... and I link them publicly all the time.


[24-Sep-24 07:36 AM] laaxus#0000
Btw @evov  @scintillating_iridescence, if you guys could change/add/remove things from the game, what would they be ?


[24-Sep-24 07:36 AM] evov#0000
I think the start should be faster for new players.


[24-Sep-24 07:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It already is, you just need Pro/Basic.


[24-Sep-24 07:37 AM] evov#0000
MM's should be dynamic... not static.


[24-Sep-24 07:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's the inventive model the devs have installed. I can only push people along it.


[24-Sep-24 07:38 AM] evov#0000
Multi item contracts would be good. Like... the ability to container things. So you can ship/trade etc multiple different items.


[24-Sep-24 07:38 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Starter bases should not be "instanced", rather they should be allowed via a "timer". so 90 days from account registration, you can plop down bases, at whatever planet you like, with no restrictions


[24-Sep-24 07:39 AM] laaxus#0000
But why ?


[24-Sep-24 07:40 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I've pointed this out in UFO, and in here.. You have plot "creep"... Starters get to only pick 1 locked-out world... And then they have to look for less viable options, out in the expanse.


[24-Sep-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I agree on everything evo


[24-Sep-24 07:41 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can make it work... But with the exponential functions that determine HQ upgrade costs + linear ship build costs, with all the logistical requirements that some heavy I/O base would require, really cuts down on the expansion rates for anyone.


[24-Sep-24 07:42 AM] evov#0000
Yea, plot limits feels kinda dumb. I'd get rid of those if possible. But also with the universe design... I think there needs to be better quality planets (or at least higher density resources) the further you go out. I think devs have mentioned this before, and it's just how this RNG universe got generated.


[24-Sep-24 07:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
"terraforming"


[24-Sep-24 07:42 AM] laaxus#0000
God I wished


[24-Sep-24 07:43 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That idea has been floated around UFO a few times... The devs aren't biting on it.


[24-Sep-24 07:44 AM] laaxus#0000
The issue with no plot limit is that there isn't a reason to have 2 diff√©rent planet with the same cogx


[24-Sep-24 07:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I mean, when your entire technical infrastructure, revolves around people getting uni degrees, in like a month, and your entire production facilities, just revolving around fancier "box" names... You're kinda limiting yourself as it, but this is just jokes at the current conventions.


[24-Sep-24 07:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Plot limits, and COGC distributions are 2 different things.


[24-Sep-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
Nvm I was thinking of permit limit


[24-Sep-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
Mb


[24-Sep-24 07:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Plot limits tend to force people out, after a certain population density.... COGC distributions are largely a "convention" with just tons of inertia behind them.


[24-Sep-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes let's get rid of plot limit


[24-Sep-24 07:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can, for instance, refocus COGC benefits, to simply POP production benefits...


[24-Sep-24 07:46 AM] evov#0000
Just due to lucky timing, I have a base on Promitor AND Deimos. I don't feel like people should be restricted from joining one or both just because they started later.


[24-Sep-24 07:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You'd be able to blend in lots more industries, on the crowded worlds with that, than just focusing on COGC perks, which have their own logistical trains, which need to be taken care of, lest your bases stall.


[24-Sep-24 07:47 AM] laaxus#0000
My dearest wish is to give an incentive for people to go horizontal, but I can't see it happening without experts being at  company level


[24-Sep-24 07:48 AM] evov#0000
Change the CoGC so the benefit is lower, and make it a gov based festivity... could make things more interesting on planets. Allow 6 or 7 experts to balance it.


[24-Sep-24 07:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Plz no.


[24-Sep-24 07:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The festivities are an "active" tool for POPR management.


[24-Sep-24 07:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I honestly dislike cogc
What do they bring ?


[24-Sep-24 07:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You only get 1 per week, with the current interface.

If we'd have to run COGC programs, via the LR, potentially lots of places would get depreciated, in terms of POPR longetivity, for the higher tiers.


[24-Sep-24 07:49 AM] evov#0000
They make 1 planet distinct from another... but yeah.. I tend to think they'd be better off if they're reduced in strength a lot.


[24-Sep-24 07:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's just the player determined COGC conventions... In truth, even on say Avalon, there's like 30-50 bases that are running non-FP/FER/INV processes on there.


[24-Sep-24 07:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just because it's an MCG planet.


[24-Sep-24 07:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Base activity summaries, under say the COGC buffer would be nice... Who's doing what industry... Now that I mentioned it.


[24-Sep-24 07:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Without such a summary, I have to click 400 PLI buffers, and tally them all up, just to know who's doing what, at any given instance.


[24-Sep-24 07:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
FIO is a community API, right


[24-Sep-24 07:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Can anybody use it?


[24-Sep-24 07:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
it is


[24-Sep-24 07:54 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yes


[24-Sep-24 07:54 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
just register for a free account....


[24-Sep-24 07:54 AM] laaxus#0000
What if cogc was Dynamic to what kind of industry is on the planet ?


[24-Sep-24 07:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There was something about ‚Äûdon‚Äôt use external tools to automate stuff‚Äú in the rules‚Ä¶ this is not included by that, I assume?


[24-Sep-24 07:55 AM] laaxus#0000
You can't automate in game


[24-Sep-24 07:55 AM] evov#0000
I could be wrong, but I think if you want to get the FIO CX prices and use them in a spreadsheet to work out your own stuff.... it's something like this

Or what about planets that can maintain multiple COGC, but each permits allow you to use 1 at a time?


[24-Sep-24 07:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Might as well remove cogc

{Reactions}
üëç 

[24-Sep-24 07:56 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, the current consensus regarding COGCs will probably hold true, in the long term.....


[24-Sep-24 07:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I would just like the devs to reinstate corp functionality, allowing either multiple corp HQs, per organization, or multiple corp membership.


[24-Sep-24 07:57 AM] evov#0000
Without cogc's you'd have a lot more ON planet colaborations


[24-Sep-24 07:58 AM] laaxus#0000
Ah yes planets might become vertical


[24-Sep-24 07:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Cuz, they basically broke corps after the politics update. There is no corp accounting. Corp accounts were basically reverted to "no use" after that update... You can only have 1 corp HQ, so it's basically a nominal membership, since so many industries require more production efficiencies, after you get beyond a certain point of game progression.


[24-Sep-24 08:00 AM] evov#0000
If cogc's didn't exist... I could imagine building HYF's on planet, someone else building INC... to sell C to people smelting... because the planet has some AL on it that others are already mining.


[24-Sep-24 08:01 AM] evov#0000
But cogc's do exist. So 20 people mine AL here... ship it to somewhere else where it gets smelted, and everything needed gets shipped there, and shipped back to the cx etc etc. Remove them or greatly reduce their potency.


[24-Sep-24 08:01 AM] laaxus#0000
Or just give a CX to every planet


[24-Sep-24 08:02 AM] jvaler#0000
funny that it's selling at afab prices


[24-Sep-24 08:02 AM] evov#0000

[24-Sep-24 08:03 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Also A-fab printers, and ship engine printers.


[24-Sep-24 08:04 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Niche mats, for niche peeps.


[24-Sep-24 08:06 AM] evov#0000
I don't think the number of PP4's come anywhere near the number of SE's that are built around the place.


[24-Sep-24 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
I just wished the CX was the actual best place to sell things


[24-Sep-24 08:09 AM] laaxus#0000
New Idea, what  if the faction shipping contract were actually shipping player stuff, but it's subsidized because it goes to the CX ?


[24-Sep-24 08:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's an idea floating around the forums, to add NPC shipper ability to HQs, wherein you can que up a number of commodity shipments, per period..


[24-Sep-24 08:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It still underlies the "issue" of getting more logistical capacity to your operations, on the cheap.


[24-Sep-24 08:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Unrelated but I'd love a Prun foxhole like gamemode


[24-Sep-24 08:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's called Screeps.


[24-Sep-24 08:13 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a better Prun... But your whole base can be wiped out in like a day, if you don't do coding for a living. :/


[24-Sep-24 08:13 AM] laaxus#0000
Oh, another game I'll fall into


[24-Sep-24 08:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's Patrician III (a better Prun, on just pure Prun stuff)... But it was made in like 1999.....


[24-Sep-24 08:16 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Should you ever play it... It'll make you think as to why the current state of Prun, is what it is.


[24-Sep-24 10:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Another idea is to do the same I'am already doing, but make it bigger. Nascent (QJ-149c) is a great candidat to just extract ALO. Then I could build up more SME on Deimos and make more money just of AL.

Just the ore alone would give me around 61.000 profit a  day


[24-Sep-24 10:08 AM] laaxus#0000
Just buy the ALO from avacyn


[24-Sep-24 10:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but then again there is shipping


[24-Sep-24 10:14 AM] jvaler#0000
shipping is why nascent is actually kinda mid imo. 327 ALO/d at a day-long trip distance is significant


[24-Sep-24 10:14 AM] jvaler#0000
getting PP2 on nike to use your AL in would be a better investment imo


[24-Sep-24 10:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
is it worth diversivy? Like for me to produce fuel, carbon, rat or so?


[24-Sep-24 10:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or is it better to stick to what you're already doing and build up horizontally/vertically


[24-Sep-24 10:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I see your point...


[24-Sep-24 10:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Lesser shipping with higher profit...


[24-Sep-24 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
D√©pends if you put more value on profit or stability


[24-Sep-24 10:25 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I guess diversity is more stable, going vertically is more profitable?


[24-Sep-24 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
Exactly the inverse

{Reactions}

[24-Sep-24 10:27 AM] manhim#0000
Being diverse requires you to stay on top of more markets and exposes you to more risks, but is generally going to be more profitable.


[24-Sep-24 10:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But doesn't it make you less volatile to market change?


[24-Sep-24 10:27 AM] manhim#0000
Going vertical means that you own more aspects of your own supply chain, so there is less risks.


[24-Sep-24 10:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
like if AL prices drop, basically all my profit atm does too


[24-Sep-24 10:28 AM] manhim#0000
It's the amount of risks exposed, but each risks are more isolated from each bases basically.


[24-Sep-24 10:29 AM] razenpok#0000
Producing diverse goods is safer than producing one good
Producing things vertically is safer than producing things using CX for inputs


[24-Sep-24 10:29 AM] razenpok#0000
That's two axes of risk-management


[24-Sep-24 10:30 AM] razenpok#0000
Safe, but less profit ofc


[24-Sep-24 10:32 AM] manhim#0000
Vertical integration also allows you to stockpile materials and use them when the price of those material rise, so you're more resilient to market changes.

But if your end-product crashes, your whole vertical integration could collapse as well.


[24-Sep-24 10:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sooo... a mixture of both should be the goal?


[24-Sep-24 10:32 AM] manhim#0000
Yup


[24-Sep-24 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000
the only goal is to have fun


[24-Sep-24 10:33 AM] manhim#0000
Just make sure to study your products well before you diversify


[24-Sep-24 10:33 AM] manhim#0000
That too

personnally I have a mixture of base, going from the safest low profit to the riskiest


[24-Sep-24 10:35 AM] jvaler#0000
if you want money get a heph BMP base :^]


[24-Sep-24 10:35 AM] laaxus#0000
i would recommend just doing a FP base on norwick once he has a WCB


[24-Sep-24 10:35 AM] razenpok#0000
If you want fat stacks of cash get a HAL base on Halcyon :Clueless1:


[24-Sep-24 10:36 AM] laaxus#0000
PE price has fallen to 8


[24-Sep-24 10:36 AM] jvaler#0000
PE isn't the only BMP product


[24-Sep-24 10:36 AM] jvaler#0000
there's always good stuff to produce


[24-Sep-24 10:37 AM] manhim#0000
Heph BMP is probably going to be my next base once I max my Deimos permit.

basically the same as having a ALO on Nascent, based on PrunPlanner


[24-Sep-24 10:39 AM] jvaler#0000
ya :/


[24-Sep-24 10:39 AM] razenpok#0000
Ye, but people really like to buy HAL


[24-Sep-24 10:39 AM] jvaler#0000
basically the story of all resource extraction


[24-Sep-24 10:39 AM] razenpok#0000
I think Hal is always out of stock these days


[24-Sep-24 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
everybody want the resource material, nobody want to buy a whole ship for the shipping


[24-Sep-24 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
just shovel money into darkfuel to do it for you :P


[24-Sep-24 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
which honestly isn't too bad of a strat ngl


[24-Sep-24 10:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
HAL is definitely less supplied then AL, that's true. But I don't feel like this is the holy grail of rock cash


[24-Sep-24 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
i think i shill darkfuel too much...


[24-Sep-24 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
does he have a public channel ?


[24-Sep-24 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
or should I dm ?


[24-Sep-24 10:43 AM] jvaler#0000
you just post an ad to ANT LM


[24-Sep-24 10:44 AM] jvaler#0000
30k AIC gets you picked up by them


[24-Sep-24 10:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That's kinda a problem. Resource extraction is an easy industry to go into, so perfect for new players. But the shipping requirement makes it basically impossible to have more then one EXT site.


[24-Sep-24 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
30k fixed ?


[24-Sep-24 10:45 AM] jvaler#0000
basically


[24-Sep-24 10:45 AM] jvaler#0000
for both LCB and WCB


[24-Sep-24 10:45 AM] razenpok#0000
VCB?


[24-Sep-24 10:45 AM] jvaler#0000
never tried üßê


[24-Sep-24 10:48 AM] jvaler#0000

[24-Sep-24 10:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
is EXO something people buy?


[24-Sep-24 10:50 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd say so


[24-Sep-24 10:50 AM] jvaler#0000
being a SET consumable it gets decent attention


[24-Sep-24 10:51 AM] razenpok#0000
How does he even keep up with this amount of ships üíÄ


[24-Sep-24 10:51 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[24-Sep-24 10:51 AM] razenpok#0000
I bet it's such a chore


[24-Sep-24 10:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, looking at  the supply/demand and trade volume rn


[24-Sep-24 10:51 AM] jvaler#0000
lots of them sit idle at the CXs waiting for ads


[24-Sep-24 10:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm trying to sell 2.5k EXO and I just can't


[24-Sep-24 10:52 AM] jvaler#0000
the ROI is atrocious, but the roleplay must be fun to them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[24-Sep-24 10:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I keep lowering the price


[24-Sep-24 10:53 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah that'd be an issue lol
it always has customers being a mid tier consumable, but it's also prone to overproduction because of it's simple recipe and how little is actually needed by SET


[24-Sep-24 10:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So as far as I see it I can either setup a ALO or HAL base, which would cap out my shipping capacity, but would make a stable amount of money - ROI of about 2 weeks. Or go with a PP2 planet on Nike and make my AL to something more valuable.


[24-Sep-24 10:56 AM] laaxus#0000
maybe look for a leased base

basically, you rent one of your permit


[24-Sep-24 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
for an usual 50-55k profit per day


[24-Sep-24 10:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm still not really sure what that is


[24-Sep-24 10:58 AM] jvaler#0000
they provide the inputs at a static price, you sell them the output at a static price.


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
and they usually provide the construction material needed to build the base


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] jvaler#0000
that's how i got my start, rise had me making AL for them on deimos for ~45k/d


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
feels like working for others, tho


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
it is


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] jvaler#0000
~~i still sell them the AL @ 600/u even though i have to source all my C, O, & ALO nowadays...~~


[24-Sep-24 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
but it is the safest base you can get


[24-Sep-24 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
no income is safer than a leased base


[24-Sep-24 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
IDC base is a close second but you don't have a 20M on you, have you ?

I think a good safe base with lot of profit and reasonable risk is a norwick FP base


[24-Sep-24 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
a safer base with less profit is the hepha bmp base


[24-Sep-24 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
no perfect solution, only trade offs


[24-Sep-24 11:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
that's RAT, DW, COF, and so on, right?


[24-Sep-24 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[24-Sep-24 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
FIM and MEA too

[24-Sep-24 11:28 AM] laaxus#0000
so be carefull


[24-Sep-24 11:28 AM] laaxus#0000
most people with a fp base have a hyf base to supply it


[24-Sep-24 11:28 AM] laaxus#0000
this is why I say this is more risky than bmp


[24-Sep-24 11:29 AM] laaxus#0000
For example, I single handedly bought the whole supply of nut


[24-Sep-24 11:29 AM] laaxus#0000
in ant


[24-Sep-24 11:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Well, my thing with BMP is... 1 - there is nothing usefull I can do with AL there (which isn't that bad, but a bit sad), but 2 - I would constantly have to look what's on demand and plan accordingly (which isn't that bad, but having a base producing wares passively is easier for the mind)


[24-Sep-24 11:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I see...


[24-Sep-24 11:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Guess a BMP base is the safer bet for now. I could even start small, setup the base an a few plants to beginn with


[24-Sep-24 11:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and expand


[24-Sep-24 11:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
well, time to research - thanks guys ‚ù§Ô∏è


[24-Sep-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I would agree on this decision


[24-Sep-24 11:35 AM] laaxus#0000
even if my FP base goes bad, I have other bases to hold me up


[24-Sep-24 11:35 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't have such securities


[24-Sep-24 11:38 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, BMPs can be more active management to keep profitable, but just because of the diversity of recipe options they're pretty consistently profitable if you pay attention. Get PRUNplanner CX settings set up good and keep an eye on what the most profitable recipe is. Do a mix of the highest profit recipes, paying attention to actual traded volume. If input prices go up or output price goes down and your margin gets smaller, just switch to a different recipe. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

to be fair that's a large number of EXOs


[24-Sep-24 12:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
how many do you produce per day?


[24-Sep-24 12:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
daily sales at ASK is around ~200 EXOs


[24-Sep-24 12:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
Sorry But I am not going to wait 12+ days for you to sell your order before I can sell mine


[24-Sep-24 12:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
I produce ~100 EXO per day which is in the constrains of daily sales


[24-Sep-24 12:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
plus it leaves some room for other people to sell as well


[24-Sep-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
none, I produced it that time when the price was 284


[24-Sep-24 12:59 PM] laaxus#0000

[24-Sep-24 12:59 PM] laaxus#0000
I did


[24-Sep-24 12:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
were you producing more then 200 per day?


[24-Sep-24 01:00 PM] laaxus#0000
no, i just put it at 270 I believe, didn't pay attention to it, and saw that I had like 500k worth of exo sitting 3 days ago


[24-Sep-24 01:01 PM] igfloz#0000
This keeps me comfortably selling internally. I too thought what a good investment EXO was to produce, but quickly reduced my production when my stock started climbing

so we get price competition -> drop of the price

You can sell that 2.5k but it will take a while + if we are not going to cover all dailies

that's what I do. I post less then 100 EXO so other people can also sell

but if you start grabbing all of the daily sales... we see the price decrease

same thing happend to REPs

if you're super looking to get into CU @pxlfox. (and you've brought it up a lot), you need partners to pull this off at this stage

the real question would be what you want to do with it, and maybe find a way to do that somewhere out there so you're not shipping 5k a week tonnage back in

I think CU might be a mass-add on refinement


[24-Sep-24 08:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Can't check right now


[24-Sep-24 08:29 PM] jcheung#0000
So bringing the ore close to consumer (cx in their case) is probably wise


[24-Sep-24 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
eh, no you're right


[24-Sep-24 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
because CU is incredibly oxygen heavy


[24-Sep-24 08:32 PM] jcheung#0000
Now there might be some better places to refine it


[24-Sep-24 08:32 PM] jcheung#0000
Than deimos


[24-Sep-24 08:32 PM] jcheung#0000
But probably not many


[24-Sep-24 08:33 PM] tanda#0000
right next to an oxygen tap or a CX are your options I think


[24-Sep-24 08:33 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. Or next to someone who consumes it


[24-Sep-24 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmmm. I wonder if there's any O sources near the CUO


[24-Sep-24 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
Since overall mass is reduced


[24-Sep-24 08:37 PM] tanda#0000
KI-446b and KI-840c Look like the best nearby match


[25-Sep-24 01:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, someday, I will setup a low profit CU operation where I just flood the galaxy with cheap CU - not not make any profit, but just to prove a point

Is there any reason not to start productions with settlers, other then the higher supply costs?


[25-Sep-24 04:25 AM] evov#0000
Depends on the planet. Sometimes higher teir pops aren't present in high numbers on a planet, so you have to wait for pop to fill. This is unlikely to be the case for setlers, but something to keep in mind when going up the worker tiers.


[25-Sep-24 04:26 AM] evov#0000
Usually... Settler tier buildings are more expensive, so build cost and repair costs typically go up along with worker tier (roughly)

Moving the discussion from #agp-operations to here, so we keep the chats clean üòõ

I feel like PP is a good Indicator if something might be profitable or not. What would I need to check to be sure, tho. Definitely trade volume and logistics. But if PP says this base will put out roughly 40.000 a day I feel like it probably will, won‚Äôt it?


[25-Sep-24 04:50 AM] kynadre#0000
It's very easy to overrely on that rough estimate especially if it's assuming everything at the long-term buy/sell values and not the immediate ones

*can't sleep for other reasons but bouncing up and down waiting for the market haul home to max out the base*


[25-Sep-24 05:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd just like to point out, that the Prunner | Prunplanner software(s) were intended to simply base design | planning for people, as they basically do the same matrix multiplication that any spreadsheet does [i.e. lots of concurrent calculations that transpose production ratios, and material stats, into something human readable]. 

Market activity/reality, however is driven by player choice and preference. While you might have strong correlations, regarding PP metrics, at any given point, those metrics are just underlined with assumptions, and may not represent any tangible reality, into the long-term.


[25-Sep-24 05:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But the general maths of how Prun works, is that you pick something to do, and then do it in the long term. Your invariable colony costs (HABs, STOs) eventually fully depreciate over 6 months. You'll usually get max experts, on whatever you do on a base, within 45 to 180 days. You'll soon be able to pitch in BID orders for all of your weekly production inputs + consumables + repair mats, and should sales turnover be whimsical on the ASK orders at any CX, you can always ask around to see who would be willing to purchase whatever you make, at any given price point (provided you have done your homework, and maintain at least a BASIC license).

[25-Sep-24 05:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Do all of that, and you'll probably be fairly insulated from whatever the market throws at you. Of course, should you deem it necessary to just deconstruct that permit due to "market forces", you'll just be losing all of that long-term infrastructure, and experts, and you might regret such a decision, when the next month rolls around.

[25-Sep-24 05:43 AM] kynadre#0000
learning to read trends, esp. over the last 30, 60, 90 days, daily trades volume, volumes already (over)stuffed on market, seeing the production chains to see how much it's actually used,


[25-Sep-24 05:45 AM] kynadre#0000
and of course, how much it's going to require your ships to be moving every day...


[25-Sep-24 05:55 AM] evov#0000
Again, I'm not intending to shit on PP as a tool, because it can be great. The issue is the false confidence it inspires in people. So a few points people need to... more strongly consider.

1. Shipping costs. When you look at the roi number or the profits etc, none of it mentions shipping. It does an AWESOME job of working out the daily volume/mass requirement, even if I don't really agree with the way it's calculated. But people rarely consider how that translates into the ongoing cost of shipping, or the captial expense (what % of a ship will this base soak up)

2. Pricing - There's a lot of different pricing methods. They all have pro's and cons (the pros and cons of the different methods could be an entire discussion on its own). Understand that there are different options, they will yield different results, and for the love of god stop looking at a base planner using one specific set of pricing models and think it somehow represents with certainty the ground truth of the matter.


[25-Sep-24 06:00 AM] evov#0000
The things it does really well ( I use it for this most of the time )

Base planning - Playing around with building counts, mixing between HB1/2 etc and the split HABs HBC etc. It's awesome for that. I did build that functionality into a spreadsheet before PP was a thing.... I discontinued that part of my sheets once PP came out.

Once you've got a base built/planned/modeled - It does a really good job of material flows. Seeing how much AL / H2O etc you're consuming and using across multiple buildings using different recipies. I think this element is great and can be helpful for scaling bases when setting up multi base projects.  ( For very large / complicated projects, I'd still use custom sheets however. But for 2 or 3 base setups, pp works great )

The planet search is a really nice tool. New to me, but I'd give it a thumbs up. Still - people need to consider the jumps/distance and how that will affect shipping requirements when using this tool.

The best feature of prunplanner is the CX settings imo


[25-Sep-24 06:02 AM] evov#0000
Disagree.


[25-Sep-24 06:03 AM] kynadre#0000
re: values I think the best way to use those is 
1) is this already flagged as a loss production if you were to buy at insta-buy and sell at insta-sell? 
2) if not, what are your investment costs that eat into your revenues? 
If your revenues are REALLY high compared to "profit", consider this item a PITA item
3) if that isn't bad, look at the estimated hauling m3/t per day
4) if that isn't bad, actually look at the market to see supply/demand, trends over 60 days, current listings & how many of those are super-stuffed you can ignore, etc.

Basically, it helps you see what you want to research further in game. But most importantly it helps you see red flags if you know where to look


[25-Sep-24 06:08 AM] evov#0000
One of the things you'll eventually run into as you move into higher tier production.... often the CX data isn't great. The volume of trades is low and out-dated. Over-reliance on whatever PP shows, means people are less inclined to actually check the data they're using... where's it comming from, is it dependable/up to date.  For making rats and low tier, market saturated items... it's probably fine (mostly). It's just really important to know where you're getting the numbers from, and why.

it uses whatever you set it to


[25-Sep-24 06:11 AM] laaxus#0000
You set it yourself ?


[25-Sep-24 06:12 AM] evov#0000
And if, for reasons above, you have different settings for each base?


[25-Sep-24 06:12 AM] evov#0000
Or you set custom input prices for things you make yourself or buy from someone.


[25-Sep-24 06:12 AM] jvaler#0000
then you still chose those settings yourself. not a black box


[25-Sep-24 06:13 AM] evov#0000
You end up with a growing list of critical numbers that are not shown when you're looking at it. And... when people link a base, there's no way to see what numbers they're using.


[25-Sep-24 06:13 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah sharing a plan doesn't share any of their cx settings, which sucks


[25-Sep-24 06:14 AM] evov#0000
Small ui changes to it would help solve those things, for sure.


[25-Sep-24 06:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't disagree


[25-Sep-24 06:16 AM] jvaler#0000

Me, looking at someone else linking their thing... it is.


[25-Sep-24 06:17 AM] jvaler#0000
when you open a shared plan you get no pricing information, it assumes nothing. you either ask the person who shared it what their settings are, or use your own


[25-Sep-24 06:20 AM] evov#0000
e.g. - Deciding what to make with a smelter -
The process to check or verify what price is being assumed for the inputs or the outputs can be a pretty slow process.

[25-Sep-24 06:30 AM] evov#0000
Just as an exercise, how would you use PP as a tool to work out how much you think you should be charging for something? Is the item in question over priced or under priced on the cx?


[25-Sep-24 06:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I look at roi if the base cost <2m, profit/d else


[25-Sep-24 06:35 AM] laaxus#0000
Using ask-ask price


[25-Sep-24 06:36 AM] evov#0000
Most people in here have smelting bases I think, so I'll try to keep it relevant to that. Say I want to buy CF off you. I'll buy all you can make, what price will you sell it to me for?


[25-Sep-24 06:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Depends 
If my base is already built, I want the same roi as the best recipe (maybe lower if that's a long term thing)
If you ask me to build the base from scratch, I'm expecting the roi of another good base


[25-Sep-24 06:38 AM] laaxus#0000
Tho it's a bit harder to know if a recipe is over profitable, or under profitable


[25-Sep-24 06:38 AM] laaxus#0000
As Price only have meaning in relation to another


[25-Sep-24 06:38 AM] evov#0000
Its not even hypothetical, I use plenty of CF, if the price is right I will buy heaps, I just need you to give me your price.


[25-Sep-24 06:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm. I'd prefer to leave the overall decision of "how much should I charge for this", up to a given player, since most could have a variety of operational decisions to take, regarding what they make. 

But looking at Prunplanners screen overview... Once you've setup your Input price flows... You then just take your daily Costs + Depreciation, and divide them, with your daily unit outputs. (you can do a weighted cut, if your base is a mixed-output setup). That'll get you with approximate break evens, for you to make your decision on.


[25-Sep-24 06:39 AM] laaxus#0000
I Can tell you that in 30-45 min once I'm home


[25-Sep-24 07:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's not that I don't know what CX setting prunplanner is pulling, it's that I don't know if it's reasonable. Like I just made a planet to smelt LIO into LI. You can set it to ANT CX BID or ANT CX ASK or PP30_Universe (my preference). But as EvoV said  you have to understand that _none_ of those numbers might really make sense. And a lot of times they can fluctuate wildly. 

Some people pick one and decide it's an authoritative and actual representation of their product's value, when it's really just a very wiggly number. Turns out LI at 1800 vs 1600 ends up being very different for my base's profitability. And it traded at both those numbers in the last 24 hours:

[25-Sep-24 08:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
COGM + x% or the last ask, whichever is greater üôÇ


[25-Sep-24 08:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
but would be the same amount of sales as COGM + 1$ ?


[25-Sep-24 08:15 AM] marat_sh#0000
or selling goods at cost to make at the begining to get people hooked


[25-Sep-24 08:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
no, but no one has good tools to guess price elasticity


[25-Sep-24 08:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
you just gotta go for it and see what happens


[25-Sep-24 08:15 AM] razenpok#0000
There are irl tools for that, but they cost a literal fortune

[25-Sep-24 08:16 AM] evov#0000
One of my more recent models I made to help get ship pricing sorted works well for that sort of elastic pricing where there's limited info on nearby items on the CX. (which is needed when dealing with things were lots of the inputs aren't on the cx)

[25-Sep-24 08:17 AM] manhim#0000
Pretty sure you can get that info from their statements/reports since it's a publicly traded company


[25-Sep-24 08:18 AM] razenpok#0000
That, ye. Bloomberg Terminal is just a tool that aggregates data from lots of those


[25-Sep-24 08:18 AM] razenpok#0000
And you can traverse the graph


[25-Sep-24 08:18 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, that terminal is quite an advantage when trading


[25-Sep-24 08:19 AM] evov#0000
My (UPI) model takes CX prices as inputs only for raw goods (extracted stuff like ALO/H2O etc) base consumables+repairs. Everything else is derived from those numbers.


[25-Sep-24 08:19 AM] razenpok#0000
I think it's more about investment and fundamental analysis

Before anyone highlights the RoI numbers looking funny - they include 90days of consumables and associated ship capital costs.


[25-Sep-24 08:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
In this case there is a price override set for the material. But the fact it doesn‚Äôt really show that anywhere you are making decisions is important to know.


[25-Sep-24 08:28 AM] jvaler#0000
oh üòí well

[25-Sep-24 08:30 AM] laaxus#0000
6100/u at current AL price, 5700/u if AL price goes back to 720/u,  2100/u if you supply me the AL for for free (290 AL a day for 58 CF a day)


[25-Sep-24 08:31 AM] evov#0000
./shrug I don't know what AL prices will do.


[25-Sep-24 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm just saying that I can't give you CF at 5700 right now, it would way too unprofitable


[25-Sep-24 08:33 AM] evov#0000
So if I give you the AL, you'll sell the CF to me at 2100/u?


[25-Sep-24 08:33 AM] evov#0000
That removes the AL risk for you yeah?


[25-Sep-24 08:33 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, that's basically it


[25-Sep-24 08:33 AM] evov#0000
Done. I'll draw up the conts if you want.


[25-Sep-24 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
let me just smelt the input materials I have stocked, then I'll turn my SME base into full CF

I would appreciate that, thank yoy


[25-Sep-24 08:35 AM] evov#0000
Before I bankrupt you, you do understand that CF uses SI right?

I think I'm getting a very good deal, yes.


[25-Sep-24 08:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
COGM for SI is ~1.1k Laaxus just puts the margin of Si into CF


[25-Sep-24 08:38 AM] marat_sh#0000
If he can't sell Si as it is, it might be better to sell Si in form of CF in bulk to you


[25-Sep-24 08:39 AM] laaxus#0000
I think I am also getting a good deal out of this


[25-Sep-24 08:39 AM] laaxus#0000

[25-Sep-24 08:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm looking at the Supply/Demand and Traded Volume graphs in PP and just want to be sure I understand them correctly. The bar in the S/D graph drops into negativee - so there is  a higher demand then a supply, right? But also, there is like no traded volume - do I interpret that right?

[25-Sep-24 08:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So people produce there KV themself... or don't trade it on the CX?


[25-Sep-24 08:42 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, people produce kv themselve


[25-Sep-24 08:42 AM] laaxus#0000
because kv has an enormous spread


[25-Sep-24 08:42 AM] laaxus#0000
and by producing themselve, they earn that spread


[25-Sep-24 08:43 AM] marat_sh#0000

[25-Sep-24 08:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but as far as I see there is money to get there - I would probably have to sell to the ask price, right?


[25-Sep-24 08:46 AM] marat_sh#0000
There is 100% money in KV and NL


[25-Sep-24 08:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
you just  make it more appealing then making it yourself


[25-Sep-24 08:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
If you drop the price too much people would just buy bulk from you


[25-Sep-24 08:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's a good thing and a bad thing


[25-Sep-24 08:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I buy NL üôÇ


[25-Sep-24 08:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
Start with like 1-2 WPLs and see how KV moves


[25-Sep-24 08:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I can't afford to build more then that atm anyways xD


[25-Sep-24 08:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
I like to build 1 or 2 buildings before I can see if items sells or not


[25-Sep-24 08:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
not invest into a whole base


[25-Sep-24 08:49 AM] evov#0000
NL and KV will 100% sell (price depending naturally)


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
both of them needed in sizable quantities so self producing takes time


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
time that people would rather not wait


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This feels like a good step, tbh. Would setup on Hephestus, right by the CX


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
ROI looks good


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
not really


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
WPL takes a lot a space


[25-Sep-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
you might want to build on the planet with expansive materials since it would take less of them


[25-Sep-24 08:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
Antares I - Astraeus is a great WPL base


[25-Sep-24 08:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
another factor I wasn't aware of üëÄ


[25-Sep-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
on heph you want to build what 'has large import/export' or 'buildings that take little space'


[25-Sep-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
so for heph BMP -> PPF


[25-Sep-24 08:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
later you can build expancive buildings there like shipbuilding stuff


[25-Sep-24 08:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
but it's for very late game

I literally just set up a base for this so let me get back to you üôÇ And I was a good girl and made sure I had enough cash for 10 days of production inputs before also buying the base upgrades


[25-Sep-24 11:57 AM] kynadre#0000
@laaxus nice, and love that AL works as the most cost-effective smelt for SI, too. CF producers unite!


[25-Sep-24 11:58 AM] kynadre#0000
my base will put out 16/d at first while I work out my cash buffers for keeping my ships hauling the heavy stuff, so hopefully eventually I can be importing my ALO rather than extracting


[25-Sep-24 12:40 PM] kynadre#0000
Since I'm trying to understand and learn more (of course...), I have a question about the screen setups. In some cases multiple sections resize together, and in others they don't... with screenshots with lines it'll make more sense...

[25-Sep-24 12:41 PM] igfloz#0000
You can drag (resize) each buffer horizontally and vertically to make them match up. I normally start by creating a new screen and then quartering it


[25-Sep-24 12:42 PM] kynadre#0000
So, with the red lines, if I raise one of the two sections up or down, both raise up or down together. The yellow lines aren't affected by how the red lines move. Similarly, the yellow lines move up or down together, and don't affect the red

[25-Sep-24 12:42 PM] kynadre#0000
How do I subdivide so that the red lines and/or the yellow lines can be further subdivided, so I have more separate height control for each subgroup?


[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] igfloz#0000
They both raise, because you sliced a buffer vertically (but they are still kinda attached)

{Reactions}

[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] kynadre#0000
how do I detach?


[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Pop the two bottom out to floating buffers


[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Then delete the tiles


[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Then split the columns


[25-Sep-24 12:43 PM] igfloz#0000
I don't know. I tend to build my layout 1st, then copy paste screen codes into each


[25-Sep-24 12:44 PM] kynadre#0000
I mean so they're part of the permanent screen, but I can adjust the heights independently


[25-Sep-24 12:44 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh, it can be done, thanks - every day a school day üôÇ


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Once columns are split, then the two columns will move left/right together but up/down for the two sub tiles will be independent for each column


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] kynadre#0000
Ooooooh


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] kynadre#0000

[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
The box on the inside is constrianed by the box on the outside


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] igfloz#0000
^^^ thats what I was trying to say (they are kinda attached)


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah, I see what you mean now that I think about it


[25-Sep-24 12:45 PM] kynadre#0000
because of the sequence and "direction" I had split them, it believes they're attached when I don't intend them to be


[25-Sep-24 12:46 PM] kynadre#0000
so I have to redo it to split different heirarchy

[25-Sep-24 10:56 PM] avalock#0000
uhhhh the plan is

fixed dog (male + female combined) tattoo back right shoulder
tria-prima alchemy symbols on right proximal phalanges 
four elements on the left prox-phalanges
symbol of chaos back of left hand
various sigils stylized to look like PCB wires on forearm
(bicep WIP, probably to do with drone things)
neck - Collar of flowers 
chest- octopus tatt :3
spine- entire astrology birth chart
potential stuff for jaw line thinking a smol version of the 4 elements


[25-Sep-24 10:57 PM] avalock#0000
and then would love art to combine the themes in between

guages (currently growing)
septum
nose ring
eye brow at somepoint

[26-Sep-24 01:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
just had my first oopsy... 
I'm currently stocking for KV production, but didn't noticed how extremly expensive TCL is...


[26-Sep-24 01:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So I have to buy in smaller quantities and ship more often for now,


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
yep


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
it's a lesson :p

[26-Sep-24 02:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I was planning to do so, until an aluminium bear made me a better deal


[26-Sep-24 02:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
My production won't be high and my cash reserves not deep enough at the beginning, that I could let it sit on the CX for 30k. Therefore I would sell it at ask, with is way lower.


[26-Sep-24 02:50 AM] razenpok#0000
fyi, KV market is *very* slow

[26-Sep-24 02:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
that too


[26-Sep-24 02:50 AM] laaxus#0000
you meant selling at bid, right ?


[26-Sep-24 02:51 AM] evov#0000
Selling at any - 14 units per week is what's moved on the ANT market for KV


[26-Sep-24 02:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Selling for the price people want it


[26-Sep-24 02:51 AM] evov#0000
Probably because the price is quite high here. Look at Moria - 621 units per week... at a price that's more....... buyable.


[26-Sep-24 02:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
27.000 is the price you're evaluating KV, right @evov ?


[26-Sep-24 02:52 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I think 27500 is what I've got it as.


[26-Sep-24 02:52 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, 27500 seems a fitting price


[26-Sep-24 02:53 AM] evov#0000
If TCL price changes a lot, that will change a bit though.


[26-Sep-24 02:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Well, for now I‚Äôm fine. Going to try to setup a functioning production and see where it takes me


[26-Sep-24 02:54 AM] razenpok#0000
TCL is extremely overpriced rn, COGM is 1900 or smth

[26-Sep-24 02:55 AM] evov#0000
And yet... Ant is the cheapest place to buy it still.


[26-Sep-24 02:55 AM] evov#0000
I've been sending my TCL off to Ben and other area's to sell as needed.


[26-Sep-24 02:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Isn‚Äôt it just H, O and C? Something like that?


[26-Sep-24 02:55 AM] evov#0000
CL


[26-Sep-24 02:55 AM] razenpok#0000
CL O H


[26-Sep-24 02:56 AM] evov#0000
H and O have been unusually high lately. Not sure what CL has been doing. Maybe that's part of why TCL is expensive... input price spikes, people stop making it etc.


[26-Sep-24 02:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
CL is at 3300 üëÄ


[26-Sep-24 02:57 AM] evov#0000
Yea, well, I don't expect TCL to be dropping any time soon then.


[26-Sep-24 02:57 AM] razenpok#0000
that's "normal" price for quite some time now


[26-Sep-24 02:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Looking at the recipes, they don‚Äôt seem to be that difficult


[26-Sep-24 02:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But then again, I don‚Äôt know how much it actually costs to produce them


[26-Sep-24 02:58 AM] evov#0000
Nothing in the game is difficult.


[26-Sep-24 02:58 AM] akyantor#0000
CL is a mare to make space / speed wise.


[26-Sep-24 02:59 AM] akyantor#0000
And is used in lots of "useful" production chains... like EPO


[26-Sep-24 02:59 AM] evov#0000
Get HAL - send it +H2O to some CHP's. Make CL. Add O/H -> Make TCL at a LAB. Make PG in a POL (also on a chem planet) - Send the PG + TCL to your WPL... make KV

[26-Sep-24 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This would probably explain why there isn‚Äôt much trading for those products


[26-Sep-24 03:01 AM] evov#0000
CHP/LAB/POL - all chem


[26-Sep-24 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Many people are probably producing it themself


[26-Sep-24 03:01 AM] laaxus#0000
I think you're forgetting how expensive lab are


[26-Sep-24 03:02 AM] evov#0000
Ok... so... get someone else to supply your TCL and produce KV for them while you make money. Once you've made enough, to buy some LAB's, start making the TCL for yourself.


[26-Sep-24 03:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
‚Ä¶ I might have spend to much money on building. Getting the restocks will be‚Ä¶ interesting

well - as all raw resource extraction sites - you need good logistic capacities to pull it off

SE-100 is a big boy club for agricultural / FP production. If you just want SE-110c (Ice Station Alpha --- water)... You'd need at least 1 LCB supplying that place, weekly. Jump intervals between ANT, and there are rather short. If you're delivering to anywhere else than the CX, you'd want at least 2 LCBs.


[26-Sep-24 07:44 AM] evov#0000
imo the boucher trio is the better option. Cheaper planet conditions, higher water density. Transport is the only potential downside compared to icestation if you're aiming to send stuff back to ant


[26-Sep-24 07:46 AM] evov#0000
From memory, the boucher set has Nitrogen extraction + chem planet in the next system over for local NS production to feed the HYF's.


[26-Sep-24 07:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000

Avoid it until you go into 15+ Permit territory


[26-Sep-24 08:09 AM] evov#0000
It was my 3rd base when I started. The shipping sucked back then, but now with the HYF and FP bases next door it's even less of a concern imo.

It is in the agri / food business though.... which doesn't always have the juiciest margins.

its not really reasonable when you are just using one Planet in that system at early stages in the game


[26-Sep-24 08:37 AM] kynadre#0000
I mean ultimately the challenge with O and H2O appears to be shipping weight, right?


[26-Sep-24 08:45 AM] evov#0000
and volume. For h2o (as an example) a 2k2k ship will carry 10k H2O.  If you convert it into DW first ... it'll carry 20k DW  ( 28k worth of H2O )

it makes sense once you conquer the logistics demand with some capital and I think that makes sense as a next step for me, too, the H20 and O

buy ads


[26-Sep-24 08:52 AM] evov#0000
Thats what I used to do. If you pay someone 40k to transport 10k H2O ... you're losing 4/unit. And it's almost free to make. I think production cost for H2O on boucher is like.. 3.6/unit

It'd be a few permits in for me to think about an extraction base, so I have more income flow to afford the upgrade to my logistics, but it's definitely a thought


[26-Sep-24 08:53 AM] evov#0000
I'm not saying it's the best choice.. but if it's something you want to do, there's usually ways to work around limitations.


[26-Sep-24 08:54 AM] kynadre#0000
right


[26-Sep-24 08:54 AM] kynadre#0000
Plus there'll be others looking to do the same when they see price spikes and ads popping up, or just making it themselves dedicatedly


[26-Sep-24 08:54 AM] kynadre#0000
what isn't made easy thanks to others is simply dealt with in our own production chains and then remains invisible on market as needed


[26-Sep-24 08:56 AM] evov#0000
Like, right now, people are buying h2o, on boucher for 32/unit. Set up the base, sell it on the LM and go back once every 60 days to top up consumables and do repairs... ends up being the lowest logistics drain in your empire.

I mean, I would make a water base but it is not feasible with the standard starter ships. So it's up to more advanced players to provide the market, but most use the water for their own production.

Regarding an SE-110c base, I'm looking for additional supply out there. I'm partnered with someone already but one full base does not supply two HYF, and I am thinking about dropping another out there to start working on things like FIM and MEA


[26-Sep-24 07:53 PM] evov#0000
I like seeing people try new and interesting ways of making money. Love your work @skyrey 

I'm about 5 weeks into my (use capital to play with the CX instead of expanding bases). No idea if I'm making money or losing money at this stage, but doing a different thing means there's new/different numbers that I care about, so it's prompted me to make different tools.

If you are interested in more market play stuff, what I found helpful was copy/pasting my trades to a sheet so I could break the numbers down and pull out useful information about my CX activities.


[27-Sep-24 12:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It was already discussed, but I can't find it in the chats anymore üôà
But if I want to calculate the production costs of a material, its bascially:

cost of input materials + cost of workforce (consumables) + building degradation + shipping costs

right?


[27-Sep-24 12:58 AM] evov#0000
That's what I would count as the production cost.

If the System was called Aeolus and had 4 gas planets, they could have been called Boreas, Zehpyrus, Notus and Euros, like the 4 Anemoi ^^

Yes. We want to grow the system as we have Jotu right there as well. As i dont need as much extraction as i have atm i also have MHL cooking there. Makes good cash

the thing is my smelter is making 3 stages of process, in a 5/4/4 ratio


[27-Sep-24 12:06 PM] kynadre#0000
5 AL 4 SI 4 CF


[27-Sep-24 12:06 PM] jcheung#0000
one at a time

[27-Sep-24 12:06 PM] kynadre#0000
I don't have enough ALO to keep the AL moving, and I need the AL for both steps 2 and 3


[27-Sep-24 12:06 PM] jcheung#0000
so what you can do is set up that ratio as recurring, and then manually inject non recurring items


[27-Sep-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
granted you're at the part right now where you need to build up stockpiles


[27-Sep-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
you have... how many queue slots?


[27-Sep-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
5?


[27-Sep-24 12:09 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah


[27-Sep-24 12:09 PM] jcheung#0000
so like... i would make up a stack that looked similar to this (input missing is recurring)

[27-Sep-24 12:09 PM] kynadre#0000
Exactly, stockpiles so I can set those as recurring


[27-Sep-24 12:10 PM] jcheung#0000
then if needed, push the AL to the the top

I just re-set my O and ALO queues to 1-order recurring, that's a fantastic help there


[27-Sep-24 12:11 PM] igfloz#0000
It will rotate through the queue anyway, so with that list example you will be producing 3 X more  AL than SI and CF

{Reactions}

[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] jcheung#0000
once. then it settles back into 5:4:4 runs until another manual injection is made

[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] kynadre#0000
I gotta work on the ratios time-wise vs. slot-wise too, because 5AL for 4SI and 4CF, well, some of those slots move way faster than others, so it's actually more cycling during the day


[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] igfloz#0000
of course - I see the bottom AL are not recurring


[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] jcheung#0000
don't try to match by time


[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] kynadre#0000
that's where PRUN sort of gave me hiccup in planning, because I was going by daily rates


[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] jcheung#0000
match by number of batches


[27-Sep-24 12:12 PM] kynadre#0000
so now I have to figure out the actual batch #s ratios


[27-Sep-24 12:13 PM] jcheung#0000

right. that's the ratio you want to plug in

[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000

[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
Gotcha, okay


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
so that's slot ratios


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
Thank youuu


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
now, you might want to actually split the AL into two smaller batches


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
Seriously huge help, I know it's taking a lot of your effort to explain here


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah for sure


[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
like 2 AL, 3 AL, 4 SI, 4CF

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Sep-24 12:14 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah that makes sense, accounting for the run size


[27-Sep-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
leaves you a slot for manual injection and reduces the stockpile size you need on AL

{Reactions}

[27-Sep-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
also just to make sure, this is what i mean, this slider controls how many batches are run off per queue slot

[27-Sep-24 12:16 PM] jcheung#0000
so in prunplanner your goal is to just tweak batch sizes to get your output/d to be in line with whatever you're trying to do-produce x, or consume x amount

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Sep-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
then you export the ratio of batches into your production queue


[27-Sep-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
oh. one last thing


[27-Sep-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
if a recurring order is unable to be performed due to lack of materials


[27-Sep-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
it will tie up one production slot and the second queued item will jump the queue when a second production slot opens up

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Sep-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have 3 things that can't be done, then it'll tie up 3 production slots and the 4th will go


[27-Sep-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
...actually i think it might just apply in general to all orders, recurring or not

and if you want a couple units of AL to get started i can either sell you some AL or loan you some AL to be repaid at a later date

150 available currently

Yeah it's just a basic math error on my part, that I assumed I'd already have the ALO needed for the daily production because I make it locally... but that'd require my smelters to stop for a day to build it up

I set it up for 2-2-1 recurring AL and 4 each recurring CF and SI, that should keep the AL going quicker and I can always adjust queue later if any buffers get misbalanced

Of course, a couple sets of eyes looking over anything, does wonder.... You'd have like a better "Lore section" on the APEX wiki, if the devs would flick on the green light for community contributions. It's hard to come by though, with only like a handful of entries. 

I do keep the custom requests I've done for others, though...

Regarding, say, VH-331c (Beanironia):

```
The stout and steadfast farmers of VH-331a, faced a dilemma in the near past, being troubled by the means of their toiling about, were brought to realize the nature of their caste. They drivelled amongst another: 'We labor all day and night, and we yield nothing short of a mountain of bean. Yet we grow dismal in our plight, as we have nothing else to improve our scene!'. 

And so a few lofty souls set out to VH-331c, deeming their goal as noble and worthy, to burn by fire, the exact thing with which they all desire. To convert by combustion, and to claim those trace metals of much need, bothering not to lend credit on any sensible heed. And so they dithered, and withered, for years on end, gaining very little to contribute towards what they wanted to extend. Through the effort, a few gave demur: 'We have none of this, yet all of that -- to where else shall we be cast?'. Yet under their feet by which they stood, lay an irony that is truly vast.

-----------------------------------

There's a few morals actually shoved in there. Opportunity costs, of doing your thing efficiently, versus doing something inefficiently. Seeking input from others. Resource density concerns. Commodity t/m3 concerns, especially when shipping things over....

#1 thing, and I don't mean it as an offense as I'm guilty, too, as are like 50%+ of English writers: when to comma, and when not to


[27-Sep-24 02:23 PM] kynadre#0000
there is a veritable fountain of commas springing forth that doth make me suspect your comma key is half-sprung and on edge of breakage XDD ‚ù§Ô∏è

also, it'll significantly help with flow, which is the reason I bring it up :this:


[27-Sep-24 02:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
When you enforce the "modern" standards, yes my comma usage is rather asinine, but I use the commas to enforce dependent clauses. It's hard to notice in text, since most are usually de-sensitised to the mountain of drivel that they read through each day. If I were to drop voice recordings here, it would be much more noticeable, regarding my intonation, and participle clauses for any set of ideas.


[27-Sep-24 02:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I type as I would like to speak. It's rather drawn out in-text, and as such it is a poor-read.


[27-Sep-24 02:28 PM] kynadre#0000
it also indicates that you're breaking mid-clause, and as a transcriber I can confirm that vocal styles are indeed punctuated differently by commas and periods than they are punctuated by breath verbally

I wonder if any said vocalities, actually do go to the gym? A developed capacity for pleural capacity, could perhaps modify such tendencies? This of course is a #hard question, since you probably know very well the set of personages who do partake in the activities that you're interested in. 

But I'll state that almost the entirely of the Middle | Early - Modern English, is entirely dependent on abitrary declinations made evident in certain publications, which were then thoroughly published and advertised as a de-facto standard for a "modern" British Empire. Before that, much of the written, and spoken discourse, was entirely free-form, with emphasis on the sounded form of the words and sentences, rather than with any conventional style. 

I'm just old fashioned, and how I write just seems natural to me? :/

Ye. I'm usually straining my eyes in attempt to read the non-native English speakers, who message me on Steam... BUT as long as they can structure their syntax/grammatical logic in accord with the usual terms of the language, then I don't have any issues with it. You usually get the same things in America, or England (yes I'm making fun of y'all), mis-spellings, improper articulations, short-cuts in syntax or actual logic.. But it's all fine, imo, if the idea gets across.

Currency limitations seem like the likely culprit. If so you're looking at a potential of a limited CX activity operator, who needed something fast into a few weeks ahead, who just couldn't bother with slow FX exchange metrics. 15-20 permits perhaps? 

CX natural lows are a consideration, but we're having constant influxes of newbros every week, for several months now..... An ideal market correction is likely at hand. There's just little market on the actual order completions.

[27-Sep-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah. Most of any real economics issue just returns to the dynamics of production and consumption (capital investments ftw)... If they try to rely on arbitrary currency valuations, then they're just using some middle-man, to evaluate their I/O functions. It's not a good idea, and it's why I'm rather hard leaning on the #real metrics of say this new gateway stuff.

[27-Sep-24 03:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Prun devs are actually doing a good job for the most part. They have limited funding, and they want to keep in-game content rolling into the future, and with the gateway possibilities, you're looking at tangible cost cutting, regarding player realities. Of course, there's significant "investment considerations" at play, but if those things are just rendered to "on-principle" returns, you'll then be looking at significant operational realities, in like 1-2 years. 

Most of the current FTL shipbuilding has been had within the same period. When me, Evov, or others were first diddling with Prun... There was nothing of the sort available for purchase @ UFO, or elsewhere, aside from GTUs pilot programs. Prun is a **very** long-term game.

Of course... I have 32 STL ships situated at the CXs for quite some time already. I'm easily keen, and ready, to start making use of any gateway routes that are made available. However I installed those STLs, on the basis of the alpha-universe gameplay (we're in beta), wherein CX localisation of production activity was the key not only for profitability, but also for tangibility (shipping requirements).

No idea, no-one cares about RoI when your permits start costing 50mil.


[27-Sep-24 03:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's more capital invensive, rather than dollar figures... The dollar figures feed into the ROIs... all dependent on active CX factors.


[27-Sep-24 03:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Permit investment is a thing as well. But if you're going to be logging in, for years... That stuff is just an operational inconvenience. It's a good metric to tender to those youths in Prun... But after several years of profitable gains compounding themselves.... It just turns into a daily churn.


[27-Sep-24 03:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
#Hazy_Fuzz? Maybe. You've got several "margin" enthusiasts who are keen on the EDC/IDC revenues. There's others who are potentially more quiet regarding their operational goals, regarding those things. 

But what you usually get, is an immediately "liquefied" commodity, which you can easily transport to a CX | Currency of interest, within 1-2 days, which will likely net you such liquidity, at better rates, than what the FX market can absorb on a weekly basis. I've done the analysis for a friend, maybe 2 months ago. 

Maybe one of you can retort against me, with better info as to why peeps are doing the EDC/IDC.... But I'm usually of the opinion that you can sink serious capital into those operations easily, and it'll net you healthy operational revenues (from capital investment #s via PP, or some other solution * daily profit proceeds). 

But you'll get better ROIs/turnovers with most PIO | SET processes...

You'll get better margins with whatever remains of the PIO |SET processes...

You'll get much better margins, but lower turnovers on the higher stuff...

And everything else in-between, will depend on how fast you can move your production, on the CX, and also through private contracts.


[27-Sep-24 03:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Evov plopped like 5 days ago why they needed to get into EDC | IDC stuff. They needed the operational revenue.. It's the traditional argument for such things.


[27-Sep-24 03:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
We're like what? 700+ days in-game... The arguments for EDC | IDC, were originally conceived within the confines of private interest groups, some -650 days after that. It's "been a long road"?

#Shit-posting upon #shit-posts... I believe that I've achieved a level of #meta-posting that few will be able to replicate... 

However, there is still a level of #foreshadowing, that is yet to still be had, all dependent upon your Prun Dev cycles. Sooner... Later... Maybe? 

Reshuffles are expected, as I'm not expecting current Dev efforts to be warranting any sort of #universe-wipe anytime soon, for like a decade?!? Yet, they will eventually come. :/

[29-Sep-24 12:13 PM] igfloz#0000
Haven't looked at MED. The COT I feel is similar to NL, overpriced !!

well that's what happend when people get used to vertical integration

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Sep-24 12:44 PM] kynadre#0000
Exactly this. The real demand is hidden because players fulfilled it themselves when they'd much rather use those bases for something else


[29-Sep-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
it kinda make sense right now Since there aren't that many players and instead of waiting people make it themselves


[29-Sep-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
so it kinda grew into it


[29-Sep-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
BUT with more new players it will start changing soon ish


[29-Sep-24 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000
Not really


[29-Sep-24 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000
Vertical means selling at ask


[29-Sep-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
+ because of permit limit, you have to diversify cogc if you want to stay in one faction space

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Sep-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
In that case, might as well do vertical


[29-Sep-24 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
I hate permit limit tbh


[29-Sep-24 12:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
I haven't played EVE so I don't know if they have a 'permit limit' or something similar to not allow you to grow exponentially


[29-Sep-24 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Just make the settling cost grow with the number of base in the planet


[29-Sep-24 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
But allow players to have Infinite permit on the planet


[29-Sep-24 01:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
plus I can't really think about any other player driven economy games


[29-Sep-24 01:16 PM] manhim#0000
There is a limit on the amount of stuff you can build at any point in time, but nothing limiting you by location.


[29-Sep-24 01:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
so like a global queue?


[29-Sep-24 01:17 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, kinda


[29-Sep-24 01:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
Interesting ü§î


[29-Sep-24 01:18 PM] manhim#0000
And once you maxed the skills, you cannot grow that amount. That's when bigger producers start paying for more alt accounts.


[29-Sep-24 01:19 PM] manhim#0000
(which is allowed in Eve)


[29-Sep-24 01:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
What stops IRL companies to exponentially expand?


[29-Sep-24 01:22 PM] manhim#0000
Laws and regulations


[29-Sep-24 01:23 PM] manhim#0000
Mainly around antitrust


[29-Sep-24 01:24 PM] manhim#0000
Also, logistics and realism


[29-Sep-24 01:25 PM] marat_sh#0000
Interesting... but I do think current permit limit is kinda small


[29-Sep-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
wait really? i thought it was against the rules but conveniently ignored so they can make more money from subscriptions


[29-Sep-24 01:31 PM] manhim#0000
You cannot multibox or use any kind of automation, but it's ok as long as each orders/actions are inputted manually

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Sep-24 01:31 PM] jvaler#0000
huh okay


[29-Sep-24 01:31 PM] kynadre#0000
it's very well known for industry and mining players (like myself) to have multiple accounts active at the same time and tab through them to apply individual orders


[29-Sep-24 01:32 PM] kynadre#0000
as long as you're not using macros or software to duplicate commands across multiple accounts at once, or make commands for you automatically, it's okay. You just have to get really comfortable with swapping between screens basically constantly yourself XD


[29-Sep-24 01:32 PM] kynadre#0000
mining and industry in Eve really couldn't function without it tbh


[29-Sep-24 01:33 PM] kynadre#0000
there's nowhere near enough industry-inclined players to meet the needs of the PVP players if everyone only single-boxed


[29-Sep-24 01:33 PM] manhim#0000
It could, but would require rebalancing cause you'd lose like 60 to 80% of all mining inputs ü§£

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Sep-24 01:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
so I guess you can't infinitly grow since there is limited throughput for mining


[29-Sep-24 01:40 PM] manhim#0000
You can't cause you can only build 10 things at once at any point in time.


[29-Sep-24 01:40 PM] manhim#0000
Except if you pay for like hundreds of accounts


[29-Sep-24 01:42 PM] manhim#0000
Also, on Eve, space is much bigger, so logistics are a much more difficult constraint on time spent. And you can only have 1 ship transporting stuff per accounts at a time.

[29-Sep-24 01:42 PM] manhim#0000
You're also vulnerable to pirates all along the way


[29-Sep-24 01:42 PM] kynadre#0000
there's also the high risk of PVP when shipping is involved, as well as the chance of threats to your stations where you've got production, as well as your mining operations


[29-Sep-24 01:42 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah, not just NPC pirates but player pirates


[29-Sep-24 01:43 PM] kynadre#0000
also competitive player groups who want your space and the resources in it


[29-Sep-24 01:43 PM] kynadre#0000
stuffing your ship to the gills is a great way to lose months worth of work


[29-Sep-24 01:43 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, building super capital takes over 1 month at a single location that can be blown to pieces by anyone motivated enough

i'll just never undock üòÑ


[29-Sep-24 01:46 PM] kynadre#0000
you can sub the accounts with in-game currency


[29-Sep-24 01:46 PM] kynadre#0000
and a lot of those operations are profitable enough that they'll far more than sustain their account cost


[29-Sep-24 01:47 PM] kynadre#0000
when I go dedicatedly mining for a month it'll cover the cost of my miners for half a year


[29-Sep-24 01:47 PM] manhim#0000

and that's where collaboration comes in to play, to work together with other players to build a bigger, more protected house, work together to defend it, do diplo with neighbors to be friends instead of food (or make consequences of hunting not worth their time)

[29-Sep-24 01:49 PM] kynadre#0000
guarantee you this game's got a whole slew of "market PVP"

[29-Sep-24 01:49 PM] kynadre#0000
destruction necessitates creation, creation necessitates destruction, indeed


[29-Sep-24 01:49 PM] kynadre#0000
esp. when a game doesn't have durability / replacement over time as natural factors


[29-Sep-24 01:51 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, but I don't think that this same approach could work with PRUN, unless the PvP is more in the form of automated buys from NPCs that gain more momentum the more people trade with them or something.


[29-Sep-24 01:52 PM] kynadre#0000
PVP is "player vs. player" by definition


[29-Sep-24 01:52 PM] manhim#0000
EvE then :p


[29-Sep-24 01:52 PM] manhim#0000
(Technically PvP cause the players are the ones running the momentum)


[29-Sep-24 01:52 PM] kynadre#0000
so competition over marketplace domination, squabbling over who gets the sale or how a planet will be COGC'd, the war of votes over various planetary bonuses & leadership, vertical integration to cut out middlemen


[29-Sep-24 01:53 PM] kynadre#0000
when you reframe it as "competition" there's a lot of it without direct combat


[29-Sep-24 01:56 PM] marat_sh#0000

it's def. a penalty to shipbuilders that free to play and basic can only have two ships active at a time, but from a gameplay sense once someone gets to where they want more, moar, MOAR!!, then they're probably more likely willing to subscribe

there's so many things related to planet management. I'm glad they have that aspect of the game, but I bet it's a major "gotcha!" for folks who go out to uninhabited planets to set up XD

So when a planet looks like this, does that mean there's more safety and health buildings (and related resources) needed for settlers and pioneers to have higher happiness, for instance? And that would improve their efficiency?

I guess the perspective that it's shipbuilding buildings, but that shipbuilding has so much downtime or uncertainty that there's gotta be something to fill the gaps

Like IDC takes millions to get even 1 software going. While newer players are locked out.


[02-Oct-24 11:10 PM] getonthetrain#0000
However, if it was ship compnents - then newer players could find a market on the lower level components while wealthier players could buy from them and complete the higher level chain. Eventually, that newer player could save up and work up the chain themselves

afaik tanda would be right here. the reason why SET is crashing so hard is because whatever temporary boost that was inflating things was removed, so it's self correcting now. nearly 10k unemployed.


[02-Oct-24 11:30 PM] jcheung#0000
that said there's enough PIO being uplifted to more than offset the SET pop loss


[02-Oct-24 11:31 PM] jcheung#0000

that as engineer pop increases it boosts education just a bit that some pioneers will promote more

For those that you do use, you just divide out what they're using per day, in a ratio of 100 (so if you employ 1800 PIOs, just divide out daily usage by 18).

[05-Oct-24 05:55 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah. Peer-to-peer material transfer conts follow the same rubric as CX purchase overflow conts, with just the simple addition, or removal, of a payment term. You don't see such things often, though.

But shipping conts are a whole different monster, as exact space is required, since the stuff is transferred into an escrow of 1 unit each.

where you have to retype the number to save it

there's also the one where if you edit a contract with an auto provision it pre-fills to warehouse if that was the original, but will set to - if you don't change it to - and back to warehouse

it'd be really, really nice when doing a contract draft, if you pick up a draft you did earlier, if it'd let you set a price per unit again instead of having to do the math on the total sum

[10-Oct-24 02:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
if I remove 12% from the 720min (12h), I get 10h 30min, which is close to the 10h 40m apex is showing, but not quite right


[10-Oct-24 02:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[10-Oct-24 02:53 AM] jcheung#0000
prunplanner is off a bit with time and quantity i've noticed


[10-Oct-24 02:53 AM] jcheung#0000
but the daily is very close to accurate


[10-Oct-24 03:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yeah, just another reason the take the numbers from PP with grain of salt, and not as the holy grail of profit üòÖ


[10-Oct-24 03:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but the numbers are close, you're right


[10-Oct-24 09:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Is there a better way to setup contracts then to create blueprints and send them to the player?


[10-Oct-24 09:25 AM] realharvey#0000
Sadly no


[10-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
No. But you can prefill them, rename and save if you think you'll use it more than once


[10-Oct-24 12:27 PM] jvaler#0000
it's a different amount of ore


[10-Oct-24 12:27 PM] jvaler#0000
but the time difference is so small it looks like it makes up for it. so the rate per day comes out accurate

[10-Oct-24 12:28 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Hm, weird


[10-Oct-24 12:28 PM] jvaler#0000
iirc there's been discussion in PCT about something to do with prunplanner's rounding. i don't remember what it was though


[10-Oct-24 12:29 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, I made myself a sheet to calculate the production costs of materials and was a bit confused by the differences.


[10-Oct-24 12:30 PM] pxlfox.#0000
But the results are really close to each other, so it‚Äôs probably negligible


[10-Oct-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
i've seen it come up around 4 times in the last 3 months, once brought up by me üòÑ


[11-Oct-24 08:43 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think the numbers pulled from FIO for natural resources allow you to calculate the amount produced per day, then you actually have to work backwards to get the recipe time. So the amount per day will probably come out right even when the quantity and recipe time are off


[11-Oct-24 10:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
What would you say is a good profit/day for a 1-permit-base?


[11-Oct-24 10:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
or is that more of a flavor thing?


[11-Oct-24 10:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Depends on cost of base, shipping required, distance from the cx and how sure I am I can sell the production


[11-Oct-24 10:38 AM] laaxus#0000
My personnal rule of thumb is
60k->80k : ok, could be better
80->100k : good
100k+ : very good


[11-Oct-24 10:38 AM] laaxus#0000
but that's because I like high profit for medium risk


[11-Oct-24 10:39 AM] laaxus#0000
some people prefer medium profit for no risk


[11-Oct-24 10:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm currently setting up some sheets to calculate the production costs of materials to get a sense for "what's a good price"


[11-Oct-24 10:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And the best you can get with AL (witch is basically my main industry atm)  is around 60,000 (with the current CX)


[11-Oct-24 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
you also have to take into account that, early on, what matter is roi, but latter on, what matter is profit per permit


[11-Oct-24 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, my starting sme base is my less profitable one


[11-Oct-24 10:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
very interesting to see those numbers tbh


[11-Oct-24 10:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but how do you get 100k with a base? üòÖ


[11-Oct-24 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
FP base producing fim/cof at ask price is juicy right now for example


[11-Oct-24 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
the easiest way to increase profit for your base is to buy at bid and sell at ask


[11-Oct-24 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
but that requires capital


[11-Oct-24 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
or you can invest more
Lower roi, but higher profit / permit


[11-Oct-24 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
the extreme of that is an IDC base


[11-Oct-24 10:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
thank you üòä


[11-Oct-24 10:56 AM] jcheung#0000
my numbers for starting out are a little more relaxed than laaxus.
20k - not great but gotta start somewhere/pay the bills
30k - acceptable
60k - good
100k - excellent
150k+ - are you sure this is sustainable?

after you have several bases and a good cashflow, then you can start revising upwards


[11-Oct-24 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, I wouldn't recommend my benchmark to new players


[11-Oct-24 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
after all, let me stress it again, what I am doing is **risky**


[11-Oct-24 11:35 AM] razenpok#0000
Jcheung is more relaaxus you would say


[11-Oct-24 11:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
My rule of thumb is also around 60-75k per base. Partly because I do vertical integration, which means I make a lot of lower-profit goods for myself just to make sure I have a consistent supply of them


[11-Oct-24 11:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
So I have FP bases that make over 100k a day, but also farms that make less than 20k. But if you look at the farms and FPs together, they average about 65k per permit which is good enough for me üòÑ


[11-Oct-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
I have some electronics bases (not IDC) with some pretty crazy profit numbers, but a lot of it sells pretty slowly on the CX


[12-Oct-24 12:38 AM] evov#0000
At low permit counts - Profit per base is far less important than RoI.

Even at high permit counts - RoI is king . . . .provided you're including the cost of the next HQ upgrade in your numbers.


[12-Oct-24 02:08 AM] evov#0000
If anyone is looking for an area to get into. Probably plenty of opportunity in this area imo

[12-Oct-24 03:17 AM] evov#0000
I don't think I'd send one of my own ships from ANT to MOR if the margin on the trip was only 30k.


[12-Oct-24 03:19 AM] laaxus#0000
isn't 30k the price from that guy that have 120 ships ?


[12-Oct-24 03:20 AM] evov#0000
No idea, I have a bajillion ships so I don't out-source shipping. I just know that when I fill up a load to go from ANT to MOR - I'd expect it to make 50-100k on average. So 30 just seems a little low.


[12-Oct-24 03:21 AM] laaxus#0000
I'll see


[12-Oct-24 03:21 AM] laaxus#0000
if in a week, nobody took it, I'll increase price


[12-Oct-24 03:25 AM] evov#0000
Just to put it in perspective - 30k, minus roughly 5k in fuel for the trip if you go slow and stretch it out to nearly 2 days = 25k.

That's about what the daily interest accrual is on the sort of loan you'd likely need to buy one of those ships.

Which is why about 50k is usually the min I'd be looking to make on a trip like that when doing any CX-CX trading.


[12-Oct-24 03:26 AM] laaxus#0000
if someone had to move a ship from Ant to moria for another purpose, he'd be happy to earn 25k on that trip, rather than -5k


[12-Oct-24 03:26 AM] laaxus#0000
your argument is sound from an investment pov


[12-Oct-24 03:27 AM] laaxus#0000
but it's different from market price


[12-Oct-24 03:29 AM] evov#0000
Or maybe they've got plenty of ships sitting around doing nothing, but don't have enough money to buy their own PE in ANT and sell it in MOR. There's plenty of potential scenario's - I'm just pointing out the economics of it is all.


[12-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jvaler#0000
it is, but that's cause they have 120 ships =P


[12-Oct-24 12:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You want at least 30k in returns, from say a LCB contract. Better yet if you can pull off 60k, from shipping inefficiencies, which make themselves known in the LMs (eventually)... At 60k returns, you're basically at 1/2 the ROI rates that you'd otherwise get from pushing the capital investment into new HQ permits.

[14-Oct-24 04:27 AM] akyantor#0000
There isn't an ability to trade on margin in the game, so it's definitely more market making than margin trading. 

They are committing both cash for the requests, and goods for the offers up front. In this case at a very large scale (about 0.5 billion in buy orders on various CX): https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/view-company?company=INGA

They're probably reflected by the general price inflation that is taking hold across all sectors... But I'm not going to be dolling out free margins to another player, just because they have sufficient capital to run all of those margin trading orders.


[14-Oct-24 02:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

Maybe related, maybe not, TA is one of the "critical points" needed for making gateways where existing CX supply isn't going to cut it. Potentially, people are getting in early to buy up stock for production of gateway parts.

This seems probably a very basic question, but I started on Harmonia and have a base that is producing somewhat well for a couple days into the game, but I have seen other Harmonia owners mention a local Ice Station Alpha, which i assume means a shorter trip time, and they are using it for water production to fuel farm settlements on Harmonia, once i get enough saved up I want to expand there to free up space on my harmonia base for more farms. Is there an easy way to find Ice Station Alpha? I dont have it on my map that i can find in Antares IV

The reality is that prices have memory. People get used to something being worth a certain value and are comfortable continuing to sell at (or refusing to pay more than) what they're used to. To put it in perspective, my rea CX trade activity   (note, I'm not actively trying to sell it, I've been using it mostly )

[17-Oct-24 09:09 PM] evov#0000
Kinda depends on what brm is worth. Kind of depends how much is being made and how much demand there is for downstream products.


[17-Oct-24 09:10 PM] tanda#0000
well BRM costs 25 to make. Transport is the real killer. Cut out that and REA is cheap


[17-Oct-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
I didn't even really strongly consider starting a REA base until I saw all the gatefuel used REA to be honest


[17-Oct-24 09:11 PM] evov#0000
I guess renegades agree's with your thesis on REA pricing.


[17-Oct-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
shortages correct in time, but new demands generally stay


[17-Oct-24 09:12 PM] evov#0000
You're assuming the "old" price was "right" .. and that it wasn't undervalued at the time. Maybe the new price is the fair/reasonable point for it to be at.


[17-Oct-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
the only assumptions I made were honestly "I hope the price doesn't crash to 450/unit because then the margin is super tight"


[17-Oct-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
I looked at actual cost of production as a baseline for value rather than historic valuation


[17-Oct-24 09:17 PM] evov#0000
Rea is basically just for ships and sci consumables. So it's not exactly a super high volume item with unlimited demand. It's just a middle point between those demands and BRM production. People will repurpose existing CHP bases to make it IF it looks profitable for them AND they can get their hands on BRM.

And honestly, it's only really critical for ships... people with FER's will gladly just make ALE or GIN if Rea price is too high.


[17-Oct-24 09:19 PM] tanda#0000
I get it's niche, but it's also niche, easy to transport, not made in any bulk when it's not 800/unit, and has future demand expansions.

How does the MTRA action in PMMG work?


[19-Oct-24 12:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
In XIT action?


[19-Oct-24 12:03 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Yes


[19-Oct-24 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Uh you open a buffer with MTRA


[19-Oct-24 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Then the XIT action will cycle through the materials and amounts


[19-Oct-24 12:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You just need to hit the change and transfer button that appears in XIT action buffer


[19-Oct-24 12:04 PM] pxlfox.#0000

[19-Oct-24 04:50 PM] evov#0000
I think if it's only 1 CX, price spikes last less than a week because CX-CX shippers/traders will jump all over that margin like a fat kid on cake.

One of the major things I look at when anticipating a major shortage - volume. How much gets traded over a week, how much supply on the CX.

Roughly, 25k traded per week.  60k+ available on the CX. I might be wrong, but I wouldn't be too worried about anything other than a short term regional spike. If it does run dry I'll throw a few thousand up there.


[19-Oct-24 04:50 PM] tanda#0000
I'm no longer worried, lol. I bought 1k instead of 100 and I'm good for a few base refills now

probably because of AL price increase

At least anecdotally, it seems like there are lots of people selling into MOR, but not many buying there for export. FX volume from NCC out is quite low


[20-Oct-24 11:58 AM] kelvinfu#0000
Prices at moria tend to be high, so people sell stuff to lowstrife and don't have much to ship back out.


[20-Oct-24 12:01 PM] kelvinfu#0000
I know my production pipeline buys inputs at HRT and eventually sells pretty much everything at Moria.

XLOOKUP function - Microsoft Support
Use the XLOOKUP function when you need to find things in a table or a range by row. For example, look up the¬†price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID. With XLOOKUP, you can look in one column for a search term, and return a result from the same row in another column, regardless of which ...


[21-Oct-24 02:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
ok - next: I found the new "tables" in sheets. Is there a way to reference data dynamically? 

Let's take this not so imaginary example:

I want to create a shipping schedule and have a table with all my ships, there name, volume and mass capacity. 
On my second table, the schedule, I would love a column, where I can select all given ships in the first table (like the select buttons, but dynamically). Is that possible?

[21-Oct-24 02:41 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Next, I would love a column in the "schedule" table with the already occupied space (lets call it A) and a second column (B), which takes the maximum volume/mass of the given ship (defined in the "ships" table), and substracts A from it, and prints out the still available space in B.


[21-Oct-24 02:42 PM] laaxus#0000
for example, in a not so imaginary example, I wanted to print (for a building) every profitable recipe, ordered by profitability


[21-Oct-24 02:43 PM] laaxus#0000
so I took the range, put a filter for profitability, sorted by profitability and printed


[21-Oct-24 02:43 PM] laaxus#0000
downside is that there is 40 null lines below it

Uh. Going off memory, go into "data validation" (how you made it a dropdown) and then there should be an option for data from range

I'll commonly just manually search stuff within specific groups this way... it's not as "clean" but functional for my needs -> For example - If I've got a full list of all the recipes in the game, put them in a table, and I want to look at just ones with an electronics COGC -

[22-Oct-24 05:38 AM] realharvey#0000
Cost per unit is 6,24 so there is still enoguh margin. Current C prices skyrocketet at ANT but you shouldnt buy it for that price.

if whoever bought 12k c had just thrown a buy order for like 800/u i'm sure it would have been filled out within a few hours

PE looks very terrible if you just source from one CX. I agree on that lol


[22-Oct-24 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
it gives people adrenaline rush


[22-Oct-24 05:41 AM] realharvey#0000
there are currently no buy orders getting filled on C. I am always 1 AIC ahead of others


[22-Oct-24 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
I was saying the same about someone buying 10M worth of Al


[22-Oct-24 05:42 AM] realharvey#0000

I do believe, that we should encourage more people to get into the C production business


[22-Oct-24 09:14 AM] realharvey#0000
C prices on ANT are currently fluctuating quite a lot, If we'd trade more internally of that we would prevent those CX shenanigans that inflate the C prices


[22-Oct-24 09:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I've been doing that


[22-Oct-24 09:15 AM] laaxus#0000
But people keep recommending BMP for the agp


[22-Oct-24 09:16 AM] tanda#0000
Problem is c production is two bases


[22-Oct-24 09:17 AM] realharvey#0000
Yeah no real way around that. Also shipping is to heavy


[22-Oct-24 09:18 AM] razenpok#0000
C production can be a one three-burn base on Harmonia


[22-Oct-24 09:18 AM] razenpok#0000
For a beginner that's a very viable option


[22-Oct-24 09:42 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, no bad thing to say split the 1m between forming two bases to get a C chain moving... it's essentially how I started and very reliably money.


[22-Oct-24 09:42 AM] akyantor#0000
You don't have to sink all the money into one base


[22-Oct-24 09:43 AM] akyantor#0000

If you're not filling out two full bases straight away it's perfectly doable

Let me look at the recipes‚Ä¶


[22-Oct-24 11:36 AM] realharvey#0000
you should focus un single or double inputs first


[22-Oct-24 11:36 AM] realharvey#0000
one base can not supply a tripple burn base afaik


[22-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
or just buy every input from the cx


[22-Oct-24 11:38 AM] realharvey#0000
CX Supply is not enough for that


[22-Oct-24 11:38 AM] realharvey#0000
enough water to supply a base? Yes. Anything else? Oh boy you will be screwed soon


[22-Oct-24 11:38 AM] laaxus#0000

A full HER base might look more appealing but it does produce 40 HER a day. Daily traded on ANT CX is also 40. Overall also quite low Supply/Demand which means no one should rely on the cx for HER

[22-Oct-24 11:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
Which as mentioned before has low traded volume on the CX. Not that it‚Äôs not worth it, but is it worth it for Pxl to take that risk?


[22-Oct-24 11:54 AM] getonthetrain#0000
If you don't buy from the CX, people don't put their products there. If you do, they will. Things will fix themselves in time.


[22-Oct-24 11:54 AM] realharvey#0000
They will, but I would not recommend starters to take that risk

if you have a full FRM base producing her, I'd buy your whole production at min(2400, ask)/u @pxlfox.


[22-Oct-24 11:56 AM] realharvey#0000
When you go the FIM -> MEA route you are not putting a lot of strain on the CX market, since it isnt as volume intensive


[22-Oct-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
starter ? no


[22-Oct-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
for a starter, certainly not


[22-Oct-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
for a third base onwards ? why not


[22-Oct-24 11:57 AM] realharvey#0000
In my opinion you should be in 10th base territory to take such risks

there is a little bit of Greens to burn on the market actually. But you'll burn 150 a day. So other than MAI I wouldn't to heavily depend just on CX for C production

well, C fits really good into my current production lines. And its the base for a lot of other stuff, so I guess I will get it sold one way or another

something isn't right in my calculations, and I'm not sure what üòÖ 
I'm trying to get the efficiency of a building, by setting the experts and COGC, but my result is off. 
I'm always expecting the 100% from happy pops.

+ efficiency bonus from COGC
On Deimos with 4 experts, this calculates to 144,74 %
APEX says, my buildings work with 149% efficiency... what am I not seeing?

[28-Oct-24 01:48 AM] evov#0000
I think the "market" and how it feels, very much depends on the specifics. Which CX? Which MAT? What sort of volume?

The past few weeks I've been tracking my CX activity. Happy to share any details from my end if it helps.


[28-Oct-24 01:57 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, if people want more market activity, it requires less person to person, out of market deal


[28-Oct-24 01:57 AM] laaxus#0000
But nobody wants that


[28-Oct-24 01:58 AM] laaxus#0000
People would rather have a deal with someone than putting a bid order


[28-Oct-24 02:03 AM] evov#0000
Case by case imo. I find a lot of bid orders are just quicker and easier. I'm open to doing person to person deals, but it's hard to beat the ultra low time overhead that comes with putting up a bid order.


[28-Oct-24 02:05 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, there was this Guy that considered quitting the game because    he Lost his 12k monthly fim supplyers


[28-Oct-24 02:05 AM] laaxus#0000
When all he had to do was putting a bid order


[28-Oct-24 02:05 AM] evov#0000
This is (aprox) my net CX activity over the past 2 and a bit months. I think I messed up on copying the trades over one week, so it's not 100% accurate.. but reasonably close I think.

[28-Oct-24 02:10 AM] evov#0000
So while dealing person to person is great in theory - it's just not practical at higher volumes I think.


[28-Oct-24 02:20 AM] evov#0000
It looks like I'm going bankrupt in a hurry, but over that period my cash position dropped by about 85mil, I get cash via ship sales through private contracts and my warehouse stock position went up by . .  more than that. So it works out ok.


[28-Oct-24 02:50 AM] laaxus#0000
The good old d√©ficit spending strategy


[28-Oct-24 02:53 AM] evov#0000
It's moreso that CX activity and Contracts (person to person) ballance each other out. I'm a net Seller when it comes to person to person contracts, which makes me a net buyer on the CX.


[28-Oct-24 02:57 AM] evov#0000
Out of curiosity, is there actually much interest in filling big buy orders via contracts? I don't see that sort of thing listed too often so I just assume it's not really much of a thing.


[28-Oct-24 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Contracts makes sense for commodity with low trade volume


[28-Oct-24 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
But for high volume commodity, I just don't get it


[28-Oct-24 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000
There was this Guy buy 12k fim a Month from that trader that left the game (insular something) ?


[28-Oct-24 03:02 AM] evov#0000
If the price is right - I'd buy something like 1.5k DW and 1.5k RAT per day. Since I don't make either of them myself and that's about what my workers consume.


[28-Oct-24 03:06 AM] laaxus#0000
You have private contracts for those ?


[28-Oct-24 03:12 AM] evov#0000
nope. CX. The only private contracts I do at the moment are -
Ship Sales
Dmos initiative - ( Something I provide for some newer players where I'll supply the inputs + transport for free, and buy the outputs at a set price, paying now and picking up when it's done )


[28-Oct-24 03:14 AM] laaxus#0000
then I don't understand this sentence


[28-Oct-24 03:14 AM] laaxus#0000
are you running on your reserve ?


[28-Oct-24 03:15 AM] evov#0000
Yes. I aim to maintain a stockpile of about 100 days of operation for consumables / repairs.
Each week I'll update my stock list and go shopping on the CX as needed.


[28-Oct-24 03:15 AM] evov#0000

[28-Oct-24 03:16 AM] evov#0000
So I don't need to worry about RAT since I've got more than I need. But I'll be actively buying DW if the price is right. If the price is (in my opinion) temporarily too high... I'll let it sit low for a while and buy up when it gets cheaper.


[28-Oct-24 03:17 AM] laaxus#0000
why not just put a bid order at the price you consider right ?


[28-Oct-24 03:17 AM] evov#0000
Because it just pointlessly soaks up capital to put bid orders up that won't get filled.


[28-Oct-24 03:19 AM] laaxus#0000
I did not expect to read this from someone hoarding WIN & AL


[28-Oct-24 03:20 AM] laaxus#0000
what's your "right" price for RAT & DW ?


[28-Oct-24 03:20 AM] evov#0000
And not all CX's are equal for all materials. So... DW for example, it makes sense for me to buy it in BEN .... but doesn't make sense to buy it in ANT.

History is a good guide. Where keeping track of my CX activity comes in really handy.  DW for example -

[28-Oct-24 03:23 AM] evov#0000
So if I've averaged buying it at 80 / unit over the last 2 months.... I'm probably not going to go all in on buying it while it's in the high 90's right now.


[28-Oct-24 03:24 AM] evov#0000
DW is a bit deceptive on the numbers because I sold a ship in exchange for DW a while ago. So that topped up the DW storage tanks for a while üôÇ


[28-Oct-24 03:26 AM] finestone#0000
I came from Sim Companies where there is a tax on CX when posting so naturally personal contracts were better


[28-Oct-24 03:29 AM] evov#0000
The CX doesn't have a 'tax' exactly. But it does have a cost.
Personal contracts are typically instant. You agree on the trade, and it's done. 

CX Sales ( Red Ask orders ) - Your stock/capital sits there for some period of time.
CX Buys ( Green Bid orders ) - Your cash/capital sits there for some period of time.

Not a tax, but it's still a cost. Selling into (Green Bid Orders) - You don't waste capital because the trade is instant... but you eat the lower cost. Same in reverse when buying from (Red Ask orders)


[28-Oct-24 03:32 AM] finestone#0000
That is certainly true! I think a small tax when posting sell orders would be nice to avoid the "Crazy high price posting for storage" it would also cause a deflationary force. Though in this conversion you were already discussing the dislike of people not using the CX more so maybe this game isn't quite ready for that yet.


[28-Oct-24 03:33 AM] evov#0000
Local markets is the other point of trade that people don't really talk about much.


[28-Oct-24 03:33 AM] finestone#0000
True i wish more people used LM


[28-Oct-24 03:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I would use LM if they were cx with limited comodity trade


[28-Oct-24 03:34 AM] finestone#0000
LM is kind of a pain to use though they need to make them like mini CX i think


[28-Oct-24 03:34 AM] laaxus#0000
LM could be a popi, and each level would give another commodity that could be traded


[28-Oct-24 03:34 AM] evov#0000
On the set of planets I'm developing now - I'm aiming to keep LM fee's and Warehouse fee's at zero if possible. I think on planet trade via LM's is a net win if used properly.


[28-Oct-24 03:35 AM] finestone#0000
All good points i like using personal cons for better deals and supporting someone that i routinally work with, that being said i try to use the CX as much as possible


[28-Oct-24 03:37 AM] evov#0000
Yea, they've all got costs. Personal contracts are good financially, they just (in my experience) have a lot higher cognitive cost. You spend more time/energy dealing with them to get the same volume of goods traded compared to using the CX.

[28-Oct-24 03:42 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, personnal contracts are usually more efficient when the price is agreed on
Just because


[28-Oct-24 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
the CX is best to find out what is the correct price at the current moment


[28-Oct-24 06:21 AM] realharvey#0000
The reason why "CX"-Trading isnt happening a lot is mostly because of the low player count we have currently and how long it takes for the market to correct itself. There is not a lot of Commodities on the CX that you can really rely on to plan your bases.

When I consider planning a base, I always take into Account: What can I take from the CX to save myself some permits and what do I have to vertically integrate myself? A lot of it comes down to: I have to integrate it myself otherwise the market will explode in prices because there is no supply. 

You could argue that if I do create that demand, supply will catch up. Which is true. But it takes way to long for it to do so. People that have cheap permits don't have the capital, to quickly setup a base to satisfy that demand and established players have to high permit costs to make that supply shortage worth their while.

Another thing is: People chase high profit bases when planning their bases and consider less how their base will impact the CX dynamic of all commodities that arre involved in it. This leads to almost no one increasing the supply of a commodity because that would only lead to 50k profit per day.

So what is the takeaway from it? I do believe that with growing player numbers the CX will become more and more attractive and the amount of commoodities you can savely rely on there will increase with time.


[28-Oct-24 06:26 AM] evov#0000
I have noticed the materials I can count on the CX to supply has steadily grown over the months/years.

I remember a point when I was setting up for making Afabs, where I felt the need to make my own CL, and EPO, and NR, and TCL and KV etc. Now . . . most of those things are available in sufficient qty's on the CX that it's not mandatory to make it yourself.


[28-Oct-24 06:56 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It sounds to me, that a central forum, where the current market state (demand, supply, development) is discussed, could benefit new and old players and help Antares as a region to grow in a more organised way.

Stating what materials need to have more supply, would give new players with available permits an incentive to expand into those fields.

Older players have often a more broader view on how different materials are interconnected, can better determine what markets need to be stocked up, and maybe even have the funds to further stimulate growth by funding new players into needed fields.


[28-Oct-24 06:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
After all, this is a game, so a more developed and stable market is beneficial to the whole player base. There is no real benefit to keep secrets and making ‚Äúbig bucks‚Äù, since there is nothing really to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.


[28-Oct-24 07:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I was thinking about collecting daily or even hourly snapshots of the market via FIO and generate weekly reports of the market movements, like e.g. traded volume, volume growth, price movements, etc. To have something searchable and sortable and maybe some logic, which points out under- or overstocked markets, production costs vs ask-price. Something like that.


[28-Oct-24 07:07 AM] tanda#0000
I know of a few tools like that and they're held very close to the chest


[28-Oct-24 07:08 AM] tanda#0000
not going to say having a public one would help me, as I have my own progression path, but I certainly would find it interesting


[28-Oct-24 07:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I wouldn‚Äôt make it public‚Ä¶ but am happy to share it with the ADI members.


[28-Oct-24 07:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It would definitely help to make more informed decisions, I hope.


[28-Oct-24 07:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm sure there are tools like that. And I do not wonder, that they aren‚Äôt made publicly available‚Ä¶


[28-Oct-24 08:46 AM] realharvey#0000
I do believe that analysing the market would be interesting. But with current player numbers it's not really predictable. If a commodity suddenly spikes in Saleprice, you can predict that more people will produce it. But predicting that spike is almost impossible since you dont know what are people are plopping down in terms of bases


[28-Oct-24 08:48 AM] tanda#0000
I can tell you CL will be seeing a demand increase, lol


[28-Oct-24 08:48 AM] tanda#0000
Just dropped one EPO base, another coming soon


[28-Oct-24 08:49 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah but thats just because of insider informationen


[28-Oct-24 08:50 AM] realharvey#0000
market for now has been very stable in terms of price and traded volumes


[28-Oct-24 08:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But that‚Äôs what I propose. Having an ADI channel to specifically discuss further expansions. Not sure, if people are willing to participate and it isn‚Äôt perfect, since not everybody in ANT is in this discord.


[28-Oct-24 08:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We could at least anticipate changes, or adjust the market quicker.


[28-Oct-24 08:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Thinking about it, that‚Äôs basically what bigger player do - buying in new players, so they don‚Äôt have to integrate everything by themself üòÖ 
Just #yapping ideas everybody else already had


[28-Oct-24 08:55 AM] realharvey#0000
in Another Discord we had anticipated a high increase in C demand. It took us 4-6 Weeks to react to it. (And Capital was no issue)


[28-Oct-24 08:57 AM] realharvey#0000
in Prun it comes down to: You make a good guess to how the market will react to your base, or you try to vertically integrate as much as possible to reduce risk


[28-Oct-24 08:58 AM] realharvey#0000
Even with my own experience I found it rather difficult to make good recommendations in terms of Bases you should aim for.


[28-Oct-24 08:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So it‚Äôs just like the real world‚Ä¶ just with fewer people in the market


[28-Oct-24 09:00 AM] realharvey#0000
I do think if you would analyse this it could help us make better estimated guesses. But here I would analyse which commodities can be reliably be bought from the CX.


[28-Oct-24 09:00 AM] realharvey#0000
Like O, H, MG, C (mostly) are pretty stable and you can rely on it from the CX


[28-Oct-24 09:01 AM] realharvey#0000
So what I am trying to get to: Have an overview with well fed data telling you if your Base alone will crash the market prices or just move it very little


[28-Oct-24 09:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Speaking about C
When I started C was very stable. Then somebody decided to buy all of it and market rose.
Same with AL (tho in ANT is stabilised quite quickly)
So I agree to you, looking at the past is not a guarantee for the future


[28-Oct-24 09:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Well, just have to code it then‚Ä¶ see you in a few weeks or so, if I don‚Äôt quite earlier üòÖ


[28-Oct-24 09:08 AM] realharvey#0000
I could assist in analysing data. I am quite good in Excel. But getting the data with nice timestamps etc. is not what I am good at :D


[28-Oct-24 09:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
One thing regarding CX vs contracts:
if I see some market cappers, like Gaia for example, sitting above the bid of somebody I know from here, I will directly send you a contract with the bid price you posted. 
I get there strategy and I‚Äôm fine with it, but I don‚Äôt like the idea to sell to them, so it just gets reposted more expensive


[28-Oct-24 09:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That‚Äôs very nice of you, but I will probably code it in PHP, since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs definitely more work, but gives me a bit more freedom about what I can do.


[28-Oct-24 09:11 AM] realharvey#0000
Reselling will always be a thing. But it also has advantages: -You get your money instantly and dont have to regulary adjust your sell orders because you are being undercutted


[28-Oct-24 09:18 AM] razenpok#0000
And in case of gaia: they resell stuff, but not with a big markup. So, you can view them as more of a market maker. I find that their orders actually stimulate the niches where there's not a lot of natural supply/demand

[28-Oct-24 01:45 PM] kynadre#0000
very much this, if someone shows, "Hey I have interest if someone would do this" by putting up the buy and sell orders, it helps folks realize there is demand


[28-Oct-24 01:46 PM] kynadre#0000
that ppl would offload it from their bases to buy from someone else if they did it at X price


[28-Oct-24 02:05 PM] realharvey#0000

*me* : now that I've been playing for more than 2 month, I'am finally wise and do not make silly mistakes !
*alse me* : produce 5 times the weekly trading volume of a commodity


[28-Oct-24 02:56 PM] realharvey#0000
for which commodity?


[28-Oct-24 03:01 PM] laaxus#0000
HSS,
I've been doing fairly well selling HSS, LC, HMS ... low volume but high profit
Then, I had a stock of HMS, and LC sitting, so I decided to produce only HSS for a few day
Now I have 600 HSS with 560 still coming

I'm ok, the stock will sell but it'll take time


[29-Oct-24 01:28 AM] evov#0000
The problem with the CX snapshots.. is that it gives a lot of very precise information about volumes, but it's very misleading about it's accuracy. You can see in very fine detail how much volume is on the market, how much is moving etc.... but you have zero idea of how much is sitting in people's warehouses or being traded privately.

There are several items where I have a lot more of it in my warehouse than exists across all the CX's. And I'm reasonably confident that there's more than 10 other people who could say the same.


[29-Oct-24 03:18 AM] realharvey#0000
When it comes to the CX there will always be problems. People with Capital can always mess with things and you can end every analysis with: But a big boy with capital could ruin all your thoughts.

[03-Nov-24 02:35 PM] jvaler#0000

Also vibes üòÑ


[03-Nov-24 02:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
basically if I run into "I'd really love to resupply this base today, but all of my ships are busy" often enough, it's time for another ship

[03-Nov-24 02:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I remember seeing someone‚Äôs formula somewhere but I don‚Äôt remember it. But uh if I can‚Äôt keep on top of my shipping then I know it‚Äôs time for a new one


[03-Nov-24 02:38 PM] igfloz#0000
I've been trying (and sometimes failing) to just keep going with my 2 starter WCB upgrades. Finally ordered a 2k/2k - I have no idea how much downtime any of my ships are going to have short term....so yeah, how the hell "should" we plan ?


[03-Nov-24 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm getting the vibes my near future expansions need a new ship


[03-Nov-24 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
I brought on one for the expansion out in Thalassa and it's been two new bases since then, so I guess vibes is right


[03-Nov-24 02:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think you could do the math for it - each base needs resupplied every x days, which requires y tons / m^3, plus accounting for approximately how long the trip there and back takes


[03-Nov-24 02:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I've never felt the need to try it so far


[03-Nov-24 02:42 PM] tanda#0000

[03-Nov-24 04:34 PM] manhim#0000
I've started working on something for average daily volume and weight per routes, but timing trips and accounting for other ship limitations isn't planned.

Adding ship trip times and planning routes would probably be too complicated to be handled in pure sheet without making my brain explode.


[03-Nov-24 04:37 PM] manhim#0000
I'd like to be able to take data straight from PRUNPlanner to help for that.


[03-Nov-24 04:42 PM] tanda#0000
you could do that, but it would require an extension


[03-Nov-24 04:42 PM] tanda#0000
and a website instead of a sheet


[03-Nov-24 05:09 PM] realharvey#0000
I do believe the gutfeeling approach is the best one. Sure you could calculate the theory. A) planets are moving and flight times change. How often you are able to login is also different.


[03-Nov-24 05:10 PM] realharvey#0000

[03-Nov-24 05:40 PM] tanda#0000
going to need to figure out xit actions soon


[03-Nov-24 05:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
If I was to calculate it, I‚Äôd basically just do 12 hour intervals - I only fly my ships in the morning and evening anyway. So each base needs resupplied every 10 days, you figure out how many ships each base takes and choose a reasonable value for how long the trips take. I assume you‚Äôd end up with an answer pretty much the same as the gut feeling approach, which is why I haven‚Äôt done it üòÑ


[03-Nov-24 05:47 PM] tanda#0000
I agree with the 12 hour thing. In the morning, ships need to be in before 5am, and between 4 and 9pm for turn around


[03-Nov-24 08:29 PM] evov#0000
r.e. Ship count -

When I feel comfortable just sending ships out once per day (24 hr intervals) ... I've got enough. If I feel like I need to jump on before work to take advantage of any of those 12 hour flight times... I'll think about making more.

Any spare shipping capacity I've got gets split between 
- sitting idle at the ANT cx - ready to leap into action when needed.
- flights that don't make sense logistically, but cognitively make life easier ( sending out near empty ships to resolve "now" type issues, without caring enough to fill them up )
- cx-cx trading
- renting them out via shipping contracts whenever a friend puts up a bat signal and needs help.

Well yes ok, but he had the stock and the capital to pull the same move that forces everyone to buy/sell at his prices at any price point he wished.
He could have done it at 40/45/50

Yeah i'm very happy i refactored my rat base on harmonia into a pure farming base.

oh so he's got us fixed back to where we were a few months ago. He did have us fixed at 40/45 for a while. I guess he finally has stocks built up enough to enforce that price point at all the CXs

My goal in the game is to provide reasonably cheap H2O to mainly the Antares CX and as best as I can to the Moria CX, I realize that the 1 million H2O listing for 40 AIC/u might make it appear as if I'm going for a 5/u margin but I assure you that the entirety of that listing  is :H2O:  I produced myself that's just there to prevent the price from instantly jumping to 60+ should my 100k listing run out before I have time to refill it.

All the H2O that I'm currently producing and buying will be listed for 35/u which provides me with a 0.10 AIC margin and that's only because I can't list both the sell and the buy for 35 ‚úåÔ∏è

it's detrimental for everybody (except C seller) but I guess it's fun


[04-Nov-24 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, this might just show that there isn't enough production of C right now, so maybe price will correct

or players might go further vertical


[04-Nov-24 08:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs purely a carbon problem - you could do the same on any number of markets if you had 20-40M AIC to spend


[04-Nov-24 08:44 AM] sidepipe#0000

[04-Nov-24 09:17 AM] manhim#0000
We could organise a strategic reserve of C. Have consumers pay a nominal fee for producers to stockpile C, then have them (or trusted brokers with money to spare) release the stockpiles based on sets of rules. The C could then either be released on CX for everyone's benefit, or to the sponsors/benefactors of the reserve.


[04-Nov-24 09:17 AM] moke.#0000
I'm invested elsewhere right now. No reserves to dick around to drive up prices on stuff I sell

I was able to get my C order filled at a reasonable price thankfully, but I've been considering starting up my second base soon, might be looking to move into C now, but I can't imagine this will be the new norm for it


[04-Nov-24 10:15 AM] mancules#0000
Is it worth trying to jump on the train if I have to completely upstart a base or do y'all expect prices to normalize before I would start seeing meaningful returns?


[04-Nov-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
if you consume c, then it's never lost


[04-Nov-24 10:18 AM] laaxus#0000
and it's hard to estimate how fas  the market will correct itself


[04-Nov-24 10:19 AM] tanda#0000
So many things consume C it will always be profitable. Chemistry actually uses more C than Metallurgy


[04-Nov-24 10:20 AM] tanda#0000
And yeah INC and FRMs are cheap cheap cheap. You can expect a 30-40 day ROI


[04-Nov-24 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
No way the roi is so low ?


[04-Nov-24 10:38 AM] tanda#0000
I usually think of worst case scenarios


[04-Nov-24 10:38 AM] tanda#0000
Which would be the market correcting back to 650ish


[04-Nov-24 11:09 AM] evov#0000
I find it amusing that in the same block of conversations... we have people crying about water being too cheap, and carbon being too expensive.

The price is what it is. It's an economics based sandbox game, people are gonna do all sorts of crazy shit for their own reasons. Factor this in when deciding how much stock you want to hold onto.. or buy extra inputs ahead of time etc.

Personally, I like seeing craziness on the CX. It makes things interesting and dynamic.


[04-Nov-24 11:28 AM] tanda#0000
Carbon is especially bad for this to happen to due to how many newer players rely on the CX for supply. That's when older players have to step up and help out, though

coke is a refined coal

so you would still need INC, but be able to feed it with something other than FRM outputs


[04-Nov-24 11:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
for coal to exist, there had to be life first. So we're basically skipping million of years by burning the trees directly


[04-Nov-24 11:33 AM] jcheung#0000
that said i wouldn't complain at all if you could go straight from deposit to SME


[04-Nov-24 11:33 AM] jcheung#0000
arguably minerals have a longer lifecycle


[04-Nov-24 11:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but technically there could be planets around there with fossil fuels. like coal and oil. Maybe even planets already barren

fertile planets by default should have coal/oil deposits

does "fertile" mean, we can plant stuff there, or that there is actually life there?


[04-Nov-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
It means you can place farms and orchards there


[04-Nov-24 11:39 AM] marat_sh#0000

I imagine Harmonia like a planet completly cultivated with farms. There are no forrests, except the ones planet for wood harvesting. Every bit of water is used for aggregation. No native plant or wildlife - just monocultures of grain and beans

Though you could make the case that there‚Äôs population in the game other than what we see in POPRs, since all the MM goods need to go somewhere

There are probaly children, elderly people and others, who don't work

A triple input C base is, as long as you can provide the inputs yourself, is probably the most efficient one, isn't?

efficient by production, yes

the most profitable is a one input iirc

[04-Nov-24 01:01 PM] jcheung#0000
depends on if you can afford the inputs


[04-Nov-24 01:02 PM] jcheung#0000
because the output always remains the same (which bothers me a lot) you need to spend a lot more permits


[04-Nov-24 01:02 PM] jcheung#0000
so with your 0 input number, divide that by 4


[04-Nov-24 01:03 PM] jcheung#0000
that said... it's still the most profitable by time

[04-Nov-24 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
what is the normal price for that?


[04-Nov-24 07:32 PM] evov#0000
Depends on the CX. If I had spare ships around I'd probably take a 2k load somewhere for 50k.


[04-Nov-24 07:32 PM] evov#0000
r.e. Carbon - I've got about 5k in my stockpile. I'll keep slowly feeding it into the CX till the price drops far enough.


[04-Nov-24 07:33 PM] jcheung#0000
yulun does it cheap, under 10/t


[04-Nov-24 07:33 PM] jcheung#0000

okay. i figured out who's fucking with the market btw


[04-Nov-24 07:33 PM] jcheung#0000
it's carboonium inc


[04-Nov-24 07:34 PM] jcheung#0000
CO CRBM


[04-Nov-24 07:35 PM] evov#0000
But it's only messed with in ANT - other CX's are still typical prices. So.... only takes a few days for CX-CX traders to start moving product around I'd imagine.


[04-Nov-24 07:35 PM] jcheung#0000
idk why they think people will bite at 2k/u

Yeah, that's where I kinda burned out. Planning is fun, but eventually you expand so far that maintenance eats into planning time. I think when I get back into it I'm gonna just build 2 or 3 temporary bases at a time. Produce massive amounts of simply supply chains, then demolish on the repair day instead of maintaining it and move on to the next project. Great for resource extraction of obsucure resources too

Amazing for STL only ships, *especially* once you have gateways up


[08-Nov-24 10:05 AM] evov#0000
At the moment all the planets are set up to support up to Engineers  ( maybe some very light sci ) -   I found that in order to find suitable places to build higher tier stuff, I had to look to other regions to cover my needs.


[08-Nov-24 10:05 AM] evov#0000
Yea.. but I still don't think STL only ships make sense.


[08-Nov-24 10:06 AM] evov#0000
Location wise - it's within range of ANT cx and HRT cx when gateways become available. And before gateways - it's less than 24hrs flight time at low fuel usage from either cx.


[08-Nov-24 10:11 AM] evov#0000
As population on the planets grow and slots open up for immigration programs, we'll open it up for more people to join. But it will remain invite only since taxes will be higher than usual, the overall goal of the project is to fund and build gateways, so it's really only suitable for people who are aware of the goals/direction and are on board with that vision.

I am going full extraction economy (still horizontal but I don't have to pray to sell items)


[09-Nov-24 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I would say the other half is how companies have limited permit per planet (and therefore cogc)
Meaning it's almost always economically optimal to diverse
My opinion is that permit should not have diminishing area, and that a company should be able to get as many permit as they desire

+ experts being company wise and not planet wise


[09-Nov-24 10:28 AM] razenpok#0000
There would be no reason to colonize non-optimal planets then


[09-Nov-24 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000
in my vision, there would be 3 kind of experts
planet level : increase production for a specific recipe (or maybe for an output good ?)
company level : increase production for a specific building (or group of building, for those building with few recipes)
Corporation level : increase production for a specific cogc


[09-Nov-24 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
with this setup, it is necessary to colonize other planets, as you basically need one planet per recipe/output good


[09-Nov-24 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000
I have another, separate hot take :
there should be not plot limit, but they should be rented
and each new plots on the planet would increase the price


[09-Nov-24 10:44 AM] tanda#0000
I think I may wind up buying out the BE market at ANT soon


[09-Nov-24 11:11 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Market turbulence isn't all that bad, however it might be a good question to ask yourself, in whatever you do... 

"What do I really need the market for, in terms of repairs, consumables, production inputs, ships, fabs.... That I just cannot do without, lest whole planets or production chains simply stop, or I have to go through extra pains or expenses to keep them running?

I think it means rather than using a lot of your own outputs to build increasingly complex items before selling at the end as a finished product


[09-Nov-24 12:32 PM] tanda#0000
you have a lot of more simple input and output goods that you buy and sell


[09-Nov-24 12:34 PM] laaxus#0000
my defintion are :
Vertical : build element of the same supply chain
Horizontal : focusing the company on a specific cogc or product (like zipatsu with water)


[09-Nov-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000

[09-Nov-24 04:38 PM] evov#0000
Disagree. INS ran out in BEN while there were plenty of BID's active. C skyrocketed in ANT while there were plenty of BID's active.

I use bids a lot, but it's tangential to the issue.

The core of the issue of items running out is that too many people are trying to use "Just in time" logistics and not keeping enough of a buffer on hand.

RL examples of this occurred during the Covid period where plenty of business' / industries saw similar issues. All of a sudden supply of critical parts could take weeks or months instead of days, which would then cause downstream delays of higher order products.

The solution for the most part - increasing buffers and being a little bit less "lean". While supply was certain, "Just in time" manufacturing logistics was "the way" - it was the most cost effective way to make stuff, and while supply was certain and consistent it worked great.

Having increased buffers allows the price to rise more gradually without supply dropping to zero. It affords more time for people to recognise there's a shortage and spin up new industry to supply into that shortage. When buffer size is too small it's like - Things are FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE, that's a bit expensive, OH shit the market is all out of X and my factories are now idle shit shit shit reeeeeeer <insert blame problem on other people instead of blaming myself for not having enough of a buffer>


[09-Nov-24 04:39 PM] tanda#0000
we're talking about two different things


[09-Nov-24 04:40 PM] tanda#0000
I'm talking about lightly populated markets that have very little to no traffic. If I'm both selling and buying in that market it helps 1)attract buyers who will use that product 2) attract producers who may otherwise have never produced that product


[09-Nov-24 04:41 PM] tanda#0000
I've seen it help take off the SFK, GC and THP markets just a little bit


[09-Nov-24 04:46 PM] tanda#0000
You might be trying to reply to Laaxus' statements regarding bids. I was specifically intending to state that bids are only ever a long term solution, they don't help in short term crises


[09-Nov-24 04:51 PM] evov#0000
For spooling up new markets - bids and asks on the cx play equally important roles imo.
I think the core of the issue in a lot of those markets though, is that you get a lot of items only get used in 1 production. So it requires a 1 to 1 production line and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to either spool up markets for the products or to lean on the CX for them.

( And yeah - to me it looked like a continuation of the "C market running dry" line of thought" - is what I thought I was commenting on sorry )


[09-Nov-24 04:52 PM] tanda#0000
I will admit I only started selling THP because PP4's turned out to be more expensive than I initially expected


[09-Nov-24 04:53 PM] evov#0000
and THP has been super proffitable to make for a while probably played a role in that choice üôÇ


[09-Nov-24 04:57 PM] evov#0000
-> Example of some items that have 1 - 1 production/use where I feel like vertical integration is going to remain the default best choice for a while.

I don't think it plays that big a role in stopping market shortages though. I think holding onto large amounts of stock.... and either stop buying, or selling back into the market... that's what helps mitigate the damage people experience from shortages.


[09-Nov-24 05:03 PM] igfloz#0000
There might also be the issue of producing 1000 of an item /week, when the market only sells 10 / week.

[09-Nov-24 05:06 PM] igfloz#0000
I figure it happens many times, to many players...... I also figure (I wonder ?) is this one of the reasons newer players don't stick around ?


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] evov#0000
Unlikely, but who knows. I think people stop playing games or leave communities for a wide range of reasons.


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] laaxus#0000
I think a bigger factor is that most players expect instant rewards, high dopamine game


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] laaxus#0000
tiktok addicts and so on


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] tanda#0000
the dopamine is in the planning


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
I mean there's instant rewards, and then there's the tutorial saying go fuck off for 12+hrs before you can do anything else, after about 5-10min...


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
the onboarding isn't great


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, i'm sorry but the set of people being turned on by planning and excel sheets is (quite unfortunately) rather small


[09-Nov-24 05:09 PM] evov#0000
As you progress through the game, you do need to (imo) change your direction... modify your goals, come up with new goals. Recognize that your circumstances have changed and that the thing you've been working towards for the last 3 months.... you've achieved... and now you need to come up with something new to work towards -   I think that can sometimes be a road block for people.

[09-Nov-24 05:25 PM] evov#0000
I honestly think one of the relative advantages I have in this game is that I play it raw. Steam version. No addons.

It forces me to make my own tools to help run/manage things. This means I'm often looking at different information / have a different perspective on things.

Sometimes that just makes life harder haha... but sometimes it means I see things others don't.

[09-Nov-24 06:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I would almost entirely agree with this sentiment... However, give me the chance to expound on this, by bringing all of it into some abstraction.

Lets say, if you're focused on the short-term realities of what you do, then you could have an "operational" mindset --- short term objectives, be they from day-to-day, towards week-to-week:

* You don't have any structure regarding what you intend to achieve in-game; you're always "reacting" to a given FIO/APEX market situation in any market region, and you may have organised some metrics, but such is dis-jointed, distracted, or generally not becoming of a joint-strategic effort, with your own means, towards some specific goal.

Short-term ASK/BID operations fall into this category, along with short-term production goals. Macro-economic strategies will not pivot based on these in-game actions, but all other micro-economic strategies will.


[09-Nov-24 06:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The inverse of this is a "structural" mindset --- long term objectives, be they from month-to-month, or towards year-to-year:

* You have planned out serious, long-term structural investments, which you intend not only to invest in-game, but to achieve them through an attrition through time. You're not really reacting on any FIO/APEX market situation, since you have your bases covered, and are only really having to deal with your "retail" market operations on the CX.

All other considerations are handled with your own permits, your own logistics, your own partnerships, or whatever else can be had, since you're no-longer on an "Input-based" operational metric, but on an "Output-based" structural metric.

Macro-economic strategies will pivot based on this... If you can out-produce a competitor, on a better break even-price... If your competitor doesn't pivot, then they will eventually break.


[09-Nov-24 06:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I suspect that everyone is within the range of these two disparate means of in-game activity. If you're not, then it would be my recommendation to consider the #other-half?

I hope that my edits are making my ideas more readable to everyone. If you want less, well god'darn, now y'all are asking for som'real hill-billy talk.

I'm barely on Discord anymore. It's the weekend and you'll get a little bit of Roh....

But Evov... people are different... But do they know why they're different, or even of the choices they pick?


[09-Nov-24 07:17 PM] evov#0000
The only thing that differentiates Roh, from someone's malfunctioning LLM project they're testing out here... is the time spent typing the responses. This is how I know Roh is a person and not a . . . Roh-bot

more data points


[10-Nov-24 04:55 AM] laaxus#0000
but then I'd have to use date and not weeks
and the x axis would become unreadable


[10-Nov-24 04:56 AM] laaxus#0000
the data points issue will resolve over time


[10-Nov-24 05:15 AM] evov#0000
How did your equity double in a week? Going from 3mil to 10mil seems.... like rapid growth.


[10-Nov-24 05:15 AM] laaxus#0000
leased bases


[10-Nov-24 05:16 AM] evov#0000
Any debt / outstanding loans should be subtracted from current assets.


[10-Nov-24 05:16 AM] laaxus#0000
i'm using pmmg equity, which do that for me I believe


[10-Nov-24 05:18 AM] evov#0000
I'd worry less about prettiness, and more about refining data to give an accurate representation. Otherwise it will set unrealistic expectations (for your future self) and potentially other new players wondering what they're doing wrong if they're not making 7mil a week by week 3.


[10-Nov-24 05:20 AM] laaxus#0000
What would you do ?


[10-Nov-24 05:22 AM] evov#0000
.... subtract outstanding loans/debt from current assets. Or find another way to measure financial growth gives the answers you're looking for. Other than taking a random set of numbers and making a pretty graph out of it... what's the objective of the chart? What are you trying to see/figure out?


[10-Nov-24 05:23 AM] laaxus#0000
Total money earned over time, is what I'm kinda looking for


[10-Nov-24 05:24 AM] evov#0000
So, net wealth, including permits / ships / bases / cash / stock etc?


[10-Nov-24 05:24 AM] laaxus#0000
exactly


[10-Nov-24 05:27 AM] evov#0000
Do you know exactly what pnmg equity includes/doesn't include and how it's calculated?


[10-Nov-24 05:30 AM] laaxus#0000
from what I understand, pmmg does buildings + stocks + cash


[10-Nov-24 05:31 AM] laaxus#0000
but does not include HQ + ships


[10-Nov-24 05:31 AM] laaxus#0000
because you technically can't sell them, so it technically can't be part of "equity"


[10-Nov-24 05:32 AM] evov#0000
What do you want to use the information for? Like, what choices or decisions will it inform and allow you to make better choices etc?


[10-Nov-24 05:32 AM] laaxus#0000
it's less about the decision process, and more about the feeling of progression


[10-Nov-24 05:33 AM] evov#0000
Do you know the value of the loans/debt etc? Just manually subtract it?


[10-Nov-24 05:34 AM] laaxus#0000
When in 1 year, I'll see a the pmmg equity line go down by 10M because I upgraded HQ, it would feel like i'm doing something bad 
Hence why I'm trying to make my own line


[10-Nov-24 05:34 AM] laaxus#0000
it substract the total owned value, including interest


[10-Nov-24 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
hence why it's technically possible to have a negative pmmg equity


[10-Nov-24 05:35 AM] evov#0000
Ok, so what did you do in that week that made you gain 7mil?


[10-Nov-24 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I received 2 leased bases


[10-Nov-24 05:36 AM] laaxus#0000
so my equity went up by the base value + production/workforce stocks


[10-Nov-24 05:37 AM] evov#0000
How does the base lease work? You get given bases, and pay them back over time by supplying discounted goods?


[10-Nov-24 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
the terms depends on the person


[10-Nov-24 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
but in this case


[10-Nov-24 05:38 AM] evov#0000
Well, in this situation, the person is you. So . . . how are they set up?


[10-Nov-24 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
I receive the construction material, the commodity needed, and I give them the production, and I'm paid a fixed amount for that service


[10-Nov-24 05:39 AM] evov#0000
For how long?


[10-Nov-24 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
undetermined


[10-Nov-24 05:40 AM] evov#0000
So you can cancel that deal tomorrow?


[10-Nov-24 05:40 AM] laaxus#0000
technically yes
I did it with one of the 2 bases : I gave back exactly what I received (construction material + input goods etc)


[10-Nov-24 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
but won't do it, because It's a mutually beneficial deal


[10-Nov-24 05:41 AM] evov#0000
Ok, sure. So that's a loan then? If you give back the cost of the base when you end the deal?


[10-Nov-24 05:42 AM] laaxus#0000
is it really a loan if the deal doesn't end ?
But yes, it could be considered a loan
The key difference is the lack of risk


[10-Nov-24 05:45 AM] laaxus#0000
I could make a leased base column now that we're talking about it


[10-Nov-24 05:45 AM] evov#0000
If you want to track YOUR GROWTH - you should probably not include the value of assets that are given to you. Such as those bases. Otherwise, you'll get a very unrealistic view on how you're doing. When the slope of the graph is primarily determined by the types of bases people gift you, and not by the production + market activity you do... it's not really a reflection of anything other than the points in time you took leased base deals.


[10-Nov-24 05:46 AM] evov#0000
I think the sort of info you're looking for.... you really need to subtract debts/loans/value of leased bases etc from it. That way it shows the net sum of your actual earnings.


[10-Nov-24 05:49 AM] evov#0000
Also using the log scale - I can imagine those 2 things combined, 2 months from now you'll be looking at it wondering why it feels like you're not getting the forward movement you might expect.

[10-Nov-24 06:04 AM] jcheung#0000
Why is there such a large gap between 2m and 4m


[10-Nov-24 06:06 AM] laaxus#0000
because it's a log scale


[10-Nov-24 06:08 AM] jcheung#0000
Then shouldn't the gap between 0 and 2 be larger?


[10-Nov-24 06:08 AM] laaxus#0000
a log scale never start at 0


[10-Nov-24 06:09 AM] jcheung#0000
Also why do you start at week 2? Didn't have week 1 data?


[10-Nov-24 06:10 AM] laaxus#0000
in this case, it started week 1, after I got my AGP grant


[10-Nov-24 06:10 AM] laaxus#0000
week 1 is 1.2M, I have to check my other computer for data


[10-Nov-24 06:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Do you switch scales at 10m?


[10-Nov-24 06:13 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[10-Nov-24 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
that's how google sheet does its log scale


[10-Nov-24 06:14 AM] evov#0000
It's just a log scale - which .... don't understand why you'd want to use a log scale for this but... ./shrug


[10-Nov-24 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
1-2-4-8-10


[10-Nov-24 06:15 AM] laaxus#0000
personnal preference


[10-Nov-24 06:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Idk, maybe I'm too used to seeing evenly spaced log scales and the labels on the left actually follows a log10 pattern


[10-Nov-24 06:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Like 10 100 1000 10000 etc


[10-Nov-24 06:17 AM] laaxus#0000
spreadsheet charts are bad


[10-Nov-24 06:18 AM] evov#0000
It's just missing a stack of lines so it looks different to whatever log graph stuff you might be used to seeing I'm guessing.

the repair mechanics of this game make me really annoyed

Why‚Äôs that?


[11-Nov-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
it's tedious, expensive


[11-Nov-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
fairly frequent

do something similar to planet stuff for upkeep if i understand it correctly


[11-Nov-24 04:54 PM] jcheung#0000
throw some amount of materials into a stockpile and it just auto consumes it


[11-Nov-24 04:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like provide a maintenance kit instead

[11-Nov-24 04:55 PM] tanda#0000
one of the issues with this games tiering is that means you have to have 3-4 different types of repair kits to consume

i don't even want kits


[11-Nov-24 04:56 PM] tanda#0000

[11-Nov-24 04:56 PM] jcheung#0000
just let me feed the materials i already need to bring into my buildings

[11-Nov-24 04:57 PM] jcheung#0000

The F word in that statement makes it all the more palpable ! - ...and I do agree with you

Allow repairs to be done similarly to workforce consumption
I‚Äôve been stewing over repairs for the last several weeks‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but every time I look at repairs I just lose motivation to continue doing anything.  So what if instead of having a narrow one day window for ideal repairs every whatever period, resources were just consumed ‚Äúdaily‚Äù like workforce consumables instead?  Any...

[12-Nov-24 05:08 AM] brelov#0000
If you need a separate building, engineers and stockpile materials to repair your ships then wouldn't that make it more inconvenient for new and f2p people? You can't exactly provide repairs to others if they can't accept contracts either.


[12-Nov-24 05:14 AM] brelov#0000
I'd rather pay for higher quality fuel that doesn't wear down your engines as much


[12-Nov-24 07:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, if this idea would make you feel better, I just ship in full production building construction mats to my bases. I repair every 45 days usually (it's not a strict rule for me). You get insufficient sums when your operation is like at day 135 -> 180, or less, due to things like BTA/LTA, or whatever buildings require only like 1 unit for the repairs. It's a ratio thing.

Around that time, I just ship back the leftovers, and bring back a fresh stock. It's turns the issue from repairs every 45-> 90 days, to every 6 months or so. I have the capital to sustain this, and the storage.


[12-Nov-24 07:22 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think PMMG extended also has semi-automated inventory transfer functions that will do most of that routine, and annoying work for you, once you set it up. Don't ask me how they work, as I haven't fiddled with them yet.


[12-Nov-24 07:24 AM] tanda#0000

I have my own custom Burn sheets that keeps tracks of my materials for repairs. I set it to "Top off" rather than provision because I don't want to overstock too much on repair materials.

That way, I always have the materials needed for repairs on hand. The next thing would be to have a sheet that warns me when it's time to repair, but I'm using XIT REPAIRS for now. It's just that it doens't keep track of varying building ages which I'd like to keep track of.

Who is min-maxing their repairs beyond their first 5 bases?


[12-Nov-24 08:19 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Or maybe focus on the expensive high tier ones and eyeball the rest


[12-Nov-24 08:23 AM] taiyibureau#0000
I have given up that min-maxing in favour of just eyeballing repairs. Less tedium which kills my enjoyment.


[12-Nov-24 08:48 AM] frentic#0000
This is an intersting start of a good topic. Repairs are really troublesome to do. I dont know if I agree with your suggestion yet per-se, but repairs is definitely needing some love.


[12-Nov-24 08:48 AM] frentic#0000
this is a neat spreadsheet üòÑ


[12-Nov-24 08:49 AM] jcheung#0000
Throw in your five cents


[12-Nov-24 08:49 AM] jcheung#0000
Considering that the cost of one of my base repairs is in the millions?


[12-Nov-24 08:49 AM] frentic#0000
I now use prunplanners new repair feature and my repair spreadsheet is now retired.


[12-Nov-24 08:50 AM] frentic#0000
I need to min-max repairs on my IDC (SL) bases because of huge costs, but only those that really get my full attention...


[12-Nov-24 08:52 AM] taiyibureau#0000
If you manage IDC then you can focus on those. I really hope you don't have more than a couple of those.


[12-Nov-24 08:53 AM] taiyibureau#0000
And even there. No harm in giving yourself some slack by planning to repair a couple days early and have a wider window before the number ticks over to the next integer


[12-Nov-24 08:54 AM] frentic#0000
Its not because of IDC per-se, was meaning that there are buildings with r-fabs that if you dont watch closely the repair costs can be overwhelming.


[12-Nov-24 08:54 AM] frentic#0000
idc is one example üòÑ


[12-Nov-24 08:54 AM] taiyibureau#0000
See my suggestion on repairing a couple days early to have some slack


[12-Nov-24 08:59 AM] frentic#0000
Its kind of interesting how every aspect of the game is intricate... repair is not an easy one... I mean, ok, I can give myself some slack by repairing earlier... but earlier then what? 30 / 45/ 60 / 90 days? what is the best window? (hint: it depends on the type of building)

These questions are not very impactful for bases with < 1 mil repair tags.. but on 20 SL bases that the repair tag approaches ~9mi fast... its def worth the study. üôÇ


[12-Nov-24 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000
That's still a narrow window


[12-Nov-24 09:02 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Not enough so send an emergency ship in case you forgot?


[12-Nov-24 09:02 AM] jcheung#0000
I want to expand it. I won't die on the hill of it being like consumables, but it needs some change


[12-Nov-24 09:02 AM] jcheung#0000
Not when I'm saturated on shipping


[12-Nov-24 09:02 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Found you issue üòÑ


[12-Nov-24 09:03 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Though I am not against your suggestion on a foundational level


[12-Nov-24 09:03 AM] jcheung#0000
Difference between me and you? I'm not as established. Repairs can be debilitating for less established players


[12-Nov-24 09:04 AM] taiyibureau#0000
High capital bases require a lot of capital? If you are dabbling with high tier you better have some cash to throw around


[12-Nov-24 09:05 AM] jcheung#0000
Even without high capital bases


[12-Nov-24 09:06 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Is it that bad? I find it to be a fraction of a percent of the base cost (daily)


[12-Nov-24 09:07 AM] frentic#0000
Well, I dont believe the issue is with the repair costs, but with the repair mechanics.

Maybe a place where you add the items and "configure" a day to be consumed and repaired would be nice... like setting up prod orders but repair orders with a due date to happen...


[12-Nov-24 09:08 AM] taiyibureau#0000
What you are describing here sounds suspiciously like player burn-out which has been seen far too many times

I wonder if there's a reason for it


[12-Nov-24 09:09 AM] taiyibureau#0000
From quick expansion and really pressing down the pedal


[12-Nov-24 09:09 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Maybe cut down on the number of bases


[12-Nov-24 09:09 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a little more nuanced. Many people will point their fingers at "shipping" at being the issue, or other things. Still the underlying issue is usually long-term expansion strategy, and application of a company's working liquidity (player decisions).


[12-Nov-24 09:10 AM] taiyibureau#0000
What I am saying is it might have less to do with the repair mechanic but with your general "workload"


[12-Nov-24 09:10 AM] jcheung#0000
Expansion and regular runs aren't a problem for me, my issue is needing to hit narrow windows


[12-Nov-24 09:10 AM] frentic#0000
I dont know why are we diverting from "can we improve repair mechanics" to "you're complaining because of burn out, heres what you need to do with burnout: 1. 2. 3.."

[12-Nov-24 09:12 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Dunno, maybe because that has a higher chance of happening than the devs changing the repair mechanics.
But I don't necessarily want to divert from the suggestion. It is still a decent idea, but I have not found the repair thing to be that tideous, that's all


[12-Nov-24 09:12 AM] frentic#0000
Sure, for you theres nothing to improve, noted. üôÇ


[12-Nov-24 09:13 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Improving APEX repair mechanics is something that we can rummage through for days, for suggestions, but we're ultimately not in control, of such patches should they ever happen.

As for jc's tight schedules, I can outsource my fleet, to pretty much hit most of your stuff, on basically a <1 day shipping intervals. Ohh wait, there's the non-multi item contract issues... Ooph...


[12-Nov-24 09:15 AM] jcheung#0000
If we "rummage for days" and present a coherent squeak, we might get grease


[12-Nov-24 09:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
How long have we been rummaging on these things, on the forums?


[12-Nov-24 09:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A few years, i'd bet.


[12-Nov-24 09:15 AM] frentic#0000
Hey @scintillating_iridescence , just realized on your suggestion: maybe if they improve shipping contracts that might indirectly make repairs easier to handle too

Some things I'd like to see
Greetings all, and especially the Devs.  I‚Äôve played an uncountable number of games in my life (and I‚Äôm not young!) So have plenty of depth to make some creative criticisms.  #1: Flee Play. Sorry, this game is not free in any sense of the word. In order to engage in the MMP part of the game, you need to pay. There is really no exception to this....

[12-Nov-24 09:19 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
at least back to 2021, there's also MoonSugar's notice, which wasn't that long ago, which echoes many same ideas.


[12-Nov-24 09:20 AM] jcheung#0000
1) bulk suggestions in one thread are never productive
2) does not actually reference the same thing i do


[12-Nov-24 09:20 AM] jcheung#0000
They want most of the cost converted to cash and mcg


[12-Nov-24 09:21 AM] jcheung#0000
Also, when developing large things, 3 years is really not that long


[12-Nov-24 09:22 AM] jcheung#0000
Especially when it's integrated and affects multiple systems


[12-Nov-24 09:22 AM] frentic#0000
oh nice finding, never saw that one: "#10: Building Upkeep. I really really really hate the way building upkeep is done." hahahah nice


[12-Nov-24 09:23 AM] frentic#0000
there are some suggestions there that were added to the game.


[12-Nov-24 09:23 AM] frentic#0000
cool to see what the game state was back then


[12-Nov-24 09:23 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
```I really really really hate the way building upkeep is done. It makes no sense at all. my building is 0.01% damaged, and it now costs me at least 25% of the starting materials to fix it!``` Yeah maybe, but he's hitting on the same point... Add another 20% to that condition, for say like 90 day repairs, or less, and you've got the same issue. It probably wont help, but it's in the feedback section of those forums. I don't see a #feature-request tag on there. So maybe there's a bit of dev tunnel vision. Who knows?


[12-Nov-24 09:24 AM] frentic#0000
Nah, devs see it all for sure.


[12-Nov-24 09:25 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Maybe the repair could just consume the building materials fractionally just as consumables are done? Then there are no large jumps in the repair costs

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[12-Nov-24 09:26 AM] taiyibureau#0000
It's not consumed automatically as consumables but it hits a similar vein


[12-Nov-24 09:27 AM] jcheung#0000
Speaking from working with game devs on other servers, if it's a multi-item thread they might glance at it once... Then forget about it because when they want to reference it it's hard to find. Also convos are mixed and they need to work to pick out specific thoughts about a specific item.


[12-Nov-24 09:28 AM] jcheung#0000
Workforce does not consume fractionally


[12-Nov-24 09:28 AM] jcheung#0000
It consumes a whole and adjusts the next consumption time


[12-Nov-24 09:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think I might have a good question, for anyone to query on the forums, somewhere in UFO or PCT...


[12-Nov-24 09:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
With long-term play times, comes great responsibilities. With so many bases to build and repair, ships to fill and send out, consumables to restock, and production queues to tinker... Should these player workflows be a hidden constraint (of some math scaling/function, pick one), just like the linear I/O's for ship production, or the exponential build costs for more HQ permits?

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[12-Nov-24 09:35 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Dev response to that will tell you if all these "issues" with current mechanics are intended/not, and if there's any interest to make them better.


[12-Nov-24 09:35 AM] jcheung#0000
What?


[12-Nov-24 09:36 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Why do we have to click so much? Why no automation? In shorter words.


[12-Nov-24 09:40 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or let me phrase it another way. If jcheung had the liquidity, and more ships than they needed, to get all his base repairs set and done on time, per their condition limits, would his problem be solved?

Or would another problem creep up in terms of the time needed to do the in-game buffer magic to get it all done.

Forget the exact repair mechanics. Assume that devs make it better in 3 months.


[12-Nov-24 09:40 AM] jcheung#0000
How do you glean that from your previous? Not seeing the connections


[12-Nov-24 09:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Add more bases, ships, inventories, cx ask/bid orders, contracts, et.c.


[12-Nov-24 09:43 AM] frentic#0000
I believe there's a line dividing automation between an active-game and an idle-game. Nowadays its too active, almost no automation... but we're moving towards more automation (pmmg actions is a good example). It's a tricky subject from a games perspective.

Multi-item-contracts, Multi-shipping-routes, etc...


[12-Nov-24 09:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Should the given interaction stay the same. I'd say for jcheung to keep playing for 2 years, and then to come back and tell me how they feel about my question. It's hard to explain if you haven't gone through the click-suffering like some others have. I used to spend like idk, 10 minutes to get all of my stuff done when I started out, less then a year. Now it's a multi-hour thing.

But there's nothing stopping us from making a relevant feature request on the forums, explaining how we want these repair mechanics to change.


[12-Nov-24 09:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And most importantly... why they need to change.

Old hats have different problems from newbies


[12-Nov-24 09:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Prun is a time-dependent game. You'll get that hat in like 100-200 days or so.


[12-Nov-24 09:52 AM] laaxus#0000
My opinion is the following :
I play this game because it requires little time a day
Therefore
The higher is making decisions time / executing decisions time, the better


[12-Nov-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
I like this game because I make decisions


[12-Nov-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
not because I click 100 buttons to execute those decisions


[12-Nov-24 09:54 AM] laaxus#0000
There are games where pressing buttons is part of the fun
SC2
the piano

I don't believe PrUn to be one of them


[12-Nov-24 10:00 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well lets see. Prun is basically an idler, that requires you to input actions and make decisions. Per jc's issues, it shouldn't be a a time-zone warfare thing, that other MMOs definitely have. 

Besides the idea to make base repairs a consumable type of thing, there is potentially another idea....

* Make it scalable --- So I only have xBBH, xBDE, xBSE........, on a base.. But not enough to repair fully... Can we update the BRA buffer, so that we can make partial repairs?


[12-Nov-24 10:01 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
... Mmm, yeah that's not going to work at all, with their current implementation.... Oooph.


[12-Nov-24 10:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Oh, yeah I think I might have found an immediate feature pitch to the repair issue...

Just add a few 0's to the production outputs of any fabs/construction materials, and then divide their MAT t/m3 metrics by that same base 10 figure, and edit everyone's CX/INV entries by the same multiple and divide their prices by the same multiple, and all other linkages or whatnot. 

Degradation/repair estimates are actually fractional (look to current MCG figures, because it's easily evidenced, due to higher #s), but since current fab figures are basically in the single digits, this results in discrete cut-off points for repairs, due to ratios and funky math.


[12-Nov-24 10:11 AM] jcheung#0000
It's not fractional, it's ceiling


[12-Nov-24 10:11 AM] jcheung#0000
Any unused is voided


[12-Nov-24 10:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's cuz they round up. So you need 1.1 ABHs to repair, but they only come in single digit increments, so it's 2 ABHs to repair fully.


[12-Nov-24 10:15 AM] jcheung#0000
Aka, ceiling


[12-Nov-24 10:16 AM] jcheung#0000
Not fractional


[12-Nov-24 10:16 AM] jcheung#0000
Fractional would leave you with .9 ABH


[12-Nov-24 10:23 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, yeah. It'll still result in the same problem. There should still be enough ideas dropped here recently, for us to start pushing in a maintenance update regarding repair/depreciation mechanics, on the **forums**.

I would rather we just make a repair consumable that can be made from all build Mats and higher tier buildings just consume said upkeep consumable faster.


[12-Nov-24 05:34 PM] finestone#0000
Example: for New Building or existing PPP/BMP
1 of each BMAT = 10 Building Upkeep Supplies
1 of each LMAT= 40 UPK
1 of each RMAT= 150 UPK 
(Optional) additional TRU/PSL recipes to decrease time
etc.
EXT uses 1 UPK/day/week
AML uses 30 UPK/day/week
etc.
(Ratios were just an example and done quickly do not hate on the ratios)

It also reduces Fab cosumption


[13-Nov-24 02:38 AM] evov#0000
I'm not sure I actually understand the issues people have with current repair mechanics.

Do people feel like the cognitive load is too high?  - I feel like repairs are lower cognitive load than workforce consumables.

Do people not like the crossover points... i.e. feeling like if they miss a breakpoint of 45/60/90 days they're somehow losing out on a massive amount of profit? - Of the people concerned about this, have you actually looked at the cost per item produced difference between each of those repair intervals? Have you looked at how that compares to the cost of lost production efficiency?


[13-Nov-24 05:01 AM] jcheung#0000
Really, you feel they're lower? Huh.


[13-Nov-24 05:03 AM] jcheung#0000
My thoughts is that to find and track the breakpoints is needlessly complicated


[13-Nov-24 05:03 AM] jcheung#0000
If you're early on the repair, you waste materials


[13-Nov-24 05:04 AM] jcheung#0000
In fact, as far as i can tell, you almost never have everything in perfect alignment


[13-Nov-24 05:05 AM] jcheung#0000
Plus once you start losing efficiency, your cogm starts to slowly creep up


[13-Nov-24 05:08 AM] jcheung#0000
If i had a factory line irl, i would have parts be purchased and maintenance be ongoing preventatively, not all in one go every specific period


[13-Nov-24 05:09 AM] evov#0000
100% the cognitive load on repairs is lower. The game has a built in tool to tell you how many of what item you need if repairing today/tomorrow/day after.


[13-Nov-24 05:09 AM] jcheung#0000
And then i also wouldn't waste materials rellacing perfectly good parts either


[13-Nov-24 05:09 AM] jcheung#0000
But that ingame tool is very broad


[13-Nov-24 05:10 AM] jcheung#0000
The day after i repair it's going to give me an amount


[13-Nov-24 05:10 AM] jcheung#0000
If i just blindly follow that, and repair every day, it's going to be super expensive


[13-Nov-24 05:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Repair should be a consumption


[13-Nov-24 05:11 AM] evov#0000
Ok, so I'd break it down into 2 parts. 1. When should you repair.   2. After you've decided 1. - the process of repairing.

The in game tool handles #2 great imo.

I think people's main issue is #1 - uncertainty about WHEN to repair.


[13-Nov-24 05:11 AM] laaxus#0000
And automatic


[13-Nov-24 05:12 AM] laaxus#0000
#2 is way too cumbersome


[13-Nov-24 05:12 AM] laaxus#0000

[13-Nov-24 05:16 AM] jcheung#0000
My complaint still stands


[13-Nov-24 05:17 AM] evov#0000
I'm still trying to understand the core issue you're concerned about. Is it the .... chunky.. nature of the repairs? You'd like it if they were smoother?


[13-Nov-24 05:28 AM] jcheung#0000
Yes. Less waste, simpler for people to do intuitively.
For consumables i can go "i maintain this stockpile target."
For repairs, if i don't have third party tools and knowledge, i would have to know that repair costs round up to the next whole, and any extra is wasted, (the following two parts are not the parts that annoys me as this work has already been done, but it applies to anyone who doesn't have access to third party tools) i then have to record the cost of repairs each day over a long period, say 100 or 200 days, then calculate the cost breakpoints and productivity losses to get a handful of specific dates where repair would cost the least. Then i have to be online and active on one of those specific dates, and if i miss it because i forgot about it, well, have to wait for the next period which is usually a month away.
I can't schedule maintenance so that it takes automatically on that date chosen
I can't nist have a stockpile for my maintenance personnel to work out of
No, i have to be present for the repair and it has to be initiated by me, at the time of repair start, and any excesses are wasted


[13-Nov-24 05:29 AM] jcheung#0000
There's a few different ways that i would be satisfied with it


[13-Nov-24 05:29 AM] jcheung#0000
Among which would be allowing me to pre-queue the repair days or weeks in advance


[13-Nov-24 05:30 AM] evov#0000
Ok I think I understand your perspective a bit better. It's about the fact that there's a "therotical optimal" time to repair, and you feel like you're being punished by doing it wrong. And doing it wrong is very easy to do because there's a lot of hoops to jump through to figure out what the optimal is... and then further hoops to jump through to put that optimal plan into action?


[13-Nov-24 05:30 AM] jcheung#0000
In short, yes


[13-Nov-24 05:31 AM] jcheung#0000
Plus if you were to make the repair costs more passive, you can introduce breakdowns which randomly degrade lines a point or two


[13-Nov-24 05:32 AM] evov#0000
I think it's mis-placed anxiety. I don't think the difference between getting it perfect, vs getting it wrong, is as big as people are concerned that it is.

Give me an example of one of your planets - The planet, a bui you have there, something you produce out of it etc. And I'll print out the production cost differences that different repair timings have on it if you like.


[13-Nov-24 05:33 AM] evov#0000
The tldr of it - I suspect - is that low tier goods built on high teir planets (TSH/HSE etc) will be punished a bit. Everything else won't be much of a concern.


[13-Nov-24 05:38 AM] jcheung#0000

Where you buy your inputs or consumables plays a much much bigger role than when you repair I find.

[13-Nov-24 05:42 AM] evov#0000

Looking at daily run cost


[13-Nov-24 05:43 AM] evov#0000
Yea, it changes. But when you look at production cost per unit - it's very minor. And that's really the metric that matters.


[13-Nov-24 05:44 AM] evov#0000
And it matters far less then a lot of other things that go completely under the radar for most people.


[13-Nov-24 05:45 AM] evov#0000
If you're producing t1 goods on high tier planets .... yea, it makes a meaningful difference I think. TSH is painful like that.

Full disclosure - I'm not modeling the drop in efficiency that happens as your repair cycle gets longer. So in reality - the shorter cycles will be better than what I'm showing.

[13-Nov-24 05:54 AM] jcheung#0000
I did notice that


[13-Nov-24 05:55 AM] evov#0000
Realistically - on a planet like deimos - the difference in production cost for goods with different (or even random) repair timings ... falls within the range of differences of planetary production fee's that exist. Or the difference of buying DW through bids vs asks.


[13-Nov-24 05:57 AM] jcheung#0000
So if we were to swap to percentages which might more easily translate to more expensive structures and look only at repair costs, repairing at 7 days early goes from 160 > 172, or 8.75% increase in repair cost for being early...
Being late increases it by 38.75%

Okay, i guess i can live with opening up the repair window slightly.

Still the whole rest of my complainst stand. I still have to meet a fairly narrow window without any base game tools to aid me with long term success


[13-Nov-24 05:59 AM] evov#0000
Yea, unfortunately as far as base game tools go - this is the best I have to offer -

Last repair - 11 days ago

For me, I do load up (at the moment) 60 days of consumables each time I repair, so noticing my consumable stacks get low is kind of a trigger. It's also pretty easy to add a schedule to a sheet to track when you've got a repair comming due.

I suppose that I don't have to drop screenies, but this one I've dropped before on UFO. 

When I was going through my own growth pains, I just chose to do a top-down approach, modelling for simplicity, and pure retention of daily production realities on my bases. I looked into the publicly posted functions...

 I could have chosen 90 day repairs, or 30 day repairs, but for the buildings that I predominantly use, a 45 day repair period was chosen since the building MAT ratios basically fit the bill that I was looking for.

In keeping with that, I have retained a 99.6% efficiency with say Prunplanner metrics, and my weekly I/O requirements are basically unaffected. If I kept to say 90 day repairs, I'd have a 96% efficiency, losing 3.5 days out of every 90, and I would definitely notice the I/O stuff when I got close to say 70 days from last repairs.

[13-Nov-24 06:13 AM] evov#0000
I used to use 90 day repair cycles for everything because it was less strain on logistics... and ships are expensive.

I'm less concerned with shipping constraints now.... so I do 60 days.


[13-Nov-24 06:18 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I suppose JC will just have to run his own utility cost metrics, for the things that **matter** to them, in the long term. Else he/she will just be tearing all the hair out of their scalp, on a weekly basis, trying to min/max everything with determined game metrics, and RL schedules.

~~Probably some parsing to cull the inactive/deleted accounts, if there are any ^^...~~

~~LEAD integration of some sort ^^...~~

But eventually, historical MAT.CX orders. If they're in a time series, you'll get to see who's doing what with anything on the markets, and you'll get very nice depth charts that show you how things are changing... Maybe a 2d waveform. I'd prefer a 3d waveform.

In game Prun is good on the overall stats, but not on the player behavior....

Yes, I've seen it happen before... People setting their market orders with very discrete price points. Price updates between them, and their immediate competitors (of scale, not in price), and everyone else is simply ignored.

But it was a private server, and yeah I lost the credentials... It's probably on piece of paper somewhere in the house. Ohh well.


[13-Nov-24 07:00 AM] tanda#0000
how easily can CONS be read? you could pull from that

I would recommend taking a look at https://discordapp.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1292871586705051729 @tyrandia


[13-Nov-24 10:05 AM] tyrandia#0000
Okay!


[13-Nov-24 10:06 AM] laaxus#0000
You don't need to check everything


[13-Nov-24 10:06 AM] laaxus#0000
but PrunPlanner is a given


[13-Nov-24 10:06 AM] jcheung#0000

Chemistry and manufacturing shipping isn't terribly bad depending on what you're making either


[13-Nov-24 10:08 AM] tyrandia#0000
Gotcha.


[13-Nov-24 10:10 AM] jcheung#0000
As a side note, some of the shipping problems will lighten up when you upgrade your ships


[13-Nov-24 10:11 AM] jcheung#0000
Common upgrade path is to take starters and upgrade to WCB (3000t, 1000m^3)


[13-Nov-24 10:11 AM] tyrandia#0000
Makes sense.


[13-Nov-24 10:11 AM] jcheung#0000
Which is between two and six times more stuff moved per shipload


[13-Nov-24 10:12 AM] jcheung#0000
We're trying to spin up an upgrade program here, projected costs around a million (give or take a bit) per ship


[13-Nov-24 10:12 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend taking a look at 
https://discordapp.com/channels/855488309802172469/1202242406494244924 
Which is basically every deal corps in the universe offer (take a special look at shipbuilders, lowstrife bank and Schaitr starter ship offer)


[13-Nov-24 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Up in MOR there's also another guy that does upgrade kits too


[13-Nov-24 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Which is similarly priced


[13-Nov-24 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
(The aforementioned Schaiter)


[13-Nov-24 10:21 AM] realharvey#0000
And always feel free to ask for suggestions or help. There's probably people that can help you out when you are in a pinch


[13-Nov-24 10:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
Prices shift around occasionally, but here's a guide with some starter ideas I recommend: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/starting-in-antares/

You'll want to make up the bases in prunplanner and check the current profits before deciding.

Before the politics update, the currency was based on the currency of the govenor's corp.

[14-Nov-24 02:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
if you just do PLI with no argument, it opens the planet search bar, and you can search names in that without PMMG. IDK if that would be an issue though because the names and ids both show up in that search...

We are Antares. We uphold to the Greek tradition, foretold and tendered by our ancestors. Antares is not where we are, but who we are. It's never established anywhere, yet it always hold a place in every Antarean's heart. Be bold; Be brave. Seek to support your fellow Antarean, and promote our common cause!.....


But if you're going to adapt the naming tradition of Antares (Greek), into a Mesopotamian one... Do you want us to start sounding like that garbled Black Speech from LotR? It's incredibly similar, linguistically (this is a proper joke, btw...)

That is, you trust that they‚Äôre going to deliver on their obligations when you close the contract

of course... we're all on discord.


[15-Nov-24 10:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Why? Correlations. Social birds tend to be affected by negative sentiment, so they usually have a high reliability if you communicate your needs, or concerns to them.


[15-Nov-24 10:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sure, and that works great if you recognize the person. It just seems weird (to me) to hold someone‚Äôs shipment hostage because someone else burned you on payment. I feel like it sets the wrong tone for what is otherwise a perfectly normal business transaction


[15-Nov-24 10:17 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah it does... They probably don't know that, since they haven't been told the usual "norms" of Prun.

it wasn't really ever intended for ADI to have a shipping *network*

that's a lot of cont burden for little benefit imo


[15-Nov-24 05:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ye.. I tried to suggest somewhere this week... that current "interactivity" mechanics... loading up ships.. (getting reps done), getting conts fulfilled, dropping/purchasing regular CX orders... adds up when you get larger... and larger.. over time as a company (this is mathematically guaranteed per dev mechanics)... Becomes an absolute burden....


[15-Nov-24 05:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you make a "mistake" well then it just adds to your own workflow... jcheung9941 may have something to add about that....


[15-Nov-24 05:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But my point being?... If you're paying for addtional "perks", montly, yearly or whatever... And those "perks" just become a complete strain on your motivation, your dedication... your productivity, due to little #"BS" mechanics that don't really pertain to RL workflows with job/recreation/sleep/gaming...  and only, and eventually become negative-feedback mechanisms (look it up if you don't know... on wikipedia....)

Then it brings the whole #profit-based mechanic system into question.. Mind you, not only has the accounting system "in-game" been borked, but corp accounting, dividends, and whatever, have just been completely rolled over since the politics update....


[15-Nov-24 05:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I don't mind the banter, but if you're paying for the development/conitinuation of the game, IF not just its "development", then you should have a say in what actually gets done... with the game.


[15-Nov-24 05:38 PM] jvaler#0000
i do wonder what the funding split is between players and the govt grants


[15-Nov-24 05:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But... When you have a whole "redirection" against QoL updates.. and towards an unspecified, and "targeted" agenda, being Gateways, and the overall out-flux of materials, and liquidity, from generally established, and growth-based economic models...

Towards a long-term, unspecified, rather vague.... And per my own half-shod estimates, #haphazard investment schemes... It begs the #question in my book as to what the incentives actually are...


[15-Nov-24 05:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This is just a philosophical question, btw... nothing against any of y'all...

Sinking a lot of resources into putting a LCB on my ship.
The CQM and the LFE's are more than the fucking LCB.....

Looking forward to being able to do my own shipping again.


[18-Nov-24 02:51 AM] evov#0000
Are you modifying a ship into a LCB ship?


[18-Nov-24 02:51 AM] evov#0000
Or just building one from parts off the cx?


[18-Nov-24 03:15 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Modifying with parts from the cx.

I bought the LCB from you actually.


[18-Nov-24 03:17 AM] evov#0000
I would - strongly - advise, don't modify your starting ships into LCB's. Modify them into WCB's (3k1k heavy).

you can upgrade your ship to WCB for 600k using Schaitr deal


[18-Nov-24 03:19 AM] evov#0000
Ship upgrade path - in my opinion -  

1. Convert 1 starter ship to WCB
2. Convert 2nd Starter ship to WCB
3. Start buying LCB's
4. Augment your fleet with more WCB's/VCB's as needed.

All ships (again, in my opinion) - would look like this -

Yeah my thinking was that for my ration/water production, volume and mass are largely equal, so i benefit more from a LCB>
That, and i'm now sunk cost, so i'm fairly committed, just need to ship it all to a shipyard now.

Next one would definitely be a WCB for flexibility/cost


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] laaxus#0000
Even tho you transport water, I would still recommend the WCB path


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] evov#0000
There's reasonable debate over if you really need a Large FTL tank. Some debate over if you actually get much benefit out of the QCR over an RCT -    but for the most part, if you're deviating from these ship designs .. you'll know exactly why you're doing it and for what specific purpose.


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] laaxus#0000
just because it's cheaper


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] laaxus#0000
LCB as a new player is a signficant investment


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] laaxus#0000
that could be generating money as a base


[18-Nov-24 03:22 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Tell me about it


[18-Nov-24 03:23 AM] evov#0000
You'll also find it's cheaper if you buy a whole ship from a ship builder ( either myself of one of the others ). Buying the parts.. you end up paying more I think.


[18-Nov-24 03:23 AM] cruelcoin#0000
In truth, i'd had a bottle of wine at that stage, and "fuggit, i'ma buy this LCB".

@evovDo you deliver to Antares/norwick/harmonia?
If so, cost extra vs Hephastus?


[18-Nov-24 03:26 AM] evov#0000
Yea... mostly because I cant be assed re-doing the contracts haha.

I did offer supply at the ANT CX for 100k cheaper. But virtually everyone preffered delivery to Heph with full tanks. So that's the standard that I offer.


[18-Nov-24 03:27 AM] evov#0000
Mostly because if people are buying a ship, their shipping capacity is limited. And it would take you 4 trips with a 500/500 to transport the parts to a shipyard.


[18-Nov-24 03:29 AM] evov#0000
For reference - current ANT CX value of the fuel to fill the tanks is 94,400.   So it really is just the best fitting option imo.

I know it was mentioned somewhere, but I can't find it. 
How much do buildings degrade per day? 
E.g. I have `x` construction materials, that cost `y` - how much of it degrades per day?


[19-Nov-24 11:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm finding formulas for building costs and efficiency, but not the daily degradation rate


[19-Nov-24 11:16 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's an inverse logistic curve. Let me give you a picture with explanation and a link.


[19-Nov-24 11:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
isn't the degradtion linear? The efficency is not, but the repair costs should be, aren't them?


[19-Nov-24 11:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Formulae: You can run the calculations on a single-column sheet, then run a difference between each to show you the delta between each day. No it's not linear. https://pct.fnar.net/building-degradation/index.html

Degradation rates are a two step calculation. 1) Calculating the delta (difference) per day, which translates to a **ratio of days old**, from day established. 2) Those figures should give you good metrics on what you'd want to repair with, as repair costs are always whole numbers, and the repair BRAs always round up.

Picture is over 180 days, after which your buildings just don't degrade.

Your condition % in your BBS buffer is not a "repair" value. It's a building productivity value, which gets plugged into your PROD queues, for daily cycles (efficiency).

We've got this recorded in #prun-resources


[19-Nov-24 11:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I worked through the resources you linked above ^^


[19-Nov-24 11:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The repair costs (amount of materials needed to repair something) is *technically* linear, but since you can't repair 0.234 BBH (less then one), it "ticks" up, as the guide explains. I was looking for 1/180 (or ~0.0055555), which is the rate buildings degrade per day.


[19-Nov-24 11:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Not to be confused with the efficency of the buildings, which is, as you mentioned above, not linear üôÇ


[19-Nov-24 12:23 PM] pxlfox.#0000
As far as I see it, building repair costs are... neglectable. For the materials I checked them so far, they make less then 1% of the production costs

tldr -< New project I've been focusing on - Area 151 - has 3 planets currently open for new members. IA-151 B (Electronics), IA-151 D (Chemistry) and IA-151 E (Metallurgy ) If anyone's interested in joining onto these planets, hit me up. >


- Area 151 - Open for recruitment -
For the last month or two, most of my spare resources in the game have been dedicated towards getting this project off the ground, and I feel like the time has come to make it a bit more public and open it up for broader involvement from the Antare's (and potentially Hortus ) community.

The goal of the project is to build up an industrial hub in a location well suited to the placement of future gateways. I've set up 5 planets ( IA-151 a/b/c/d/e ) with cogc's for Construction / Electronics / Manufacturing / Chemistry and Metallurgy. The intent with the project is to charge higher than normal taxes (mostly on the higher tier pops) and to use the combined tax base of all the planets in the project to fund the construction of gateways. 

The hope, is that having this mix of CoGC planets in the same system, less than a day's flight from ANT and less than a day's flight from HRT, will provide benefits in terms of logistics, potential collaboration and availability of higher teir pop, that exceeds the cost of the extra taxes.

We have base establishment fee's on the planets, but it's not something we expect anyone to actually pay, they're just there to make sure that only people who are aligned with the broader goals of the project put bases down on the planets. It also allows us to better control the influx of population demand, so we can run immigration programs specifically for each person when they join to help reduce waiting time between joining and getting their population filled.

At the moment, we have inactive Immigration programs ( and as a result an opening for a new base ) on the following planets.
IA-151 B (Electronics)
IA-151 D (Chemistry)
IA-151 E (Metallurgy)

If anyone's interested in joining Area 151, or if you have any questions, hit me up.

Sure would come in handy if there was a system out there, friendly to high teir pops that had Electronics, Chemistry, Manufacturing and Metallurgy in the same system. A person could probably just print capacitor banks there if they were so inclined.

[23-Nov-24 10:26 PM] tanda#0000
@earthforged I've gone ahead and given you the project associate role so you can see and talk in the majority of the server. Perhaps that will give you the information you need to make decisions on next steps


[23-Nov-24 10:26 PM] tanda#0000
What are you looking to accomplish/specialize in?


[23-Nov-24 11:10 PM] antisyntax#0000
I wonder if PRUN ever plans on allowing scripts to play the game? I love the idea of designing a script that will control my empire lol.

I know you can pull data from the FIO API, so it's already half there, I think. I'm not that good at coding so I don't know the difficulties in allowing scripts to control a user's company, but I like the idea of automating selling and buying resources at certain price points, etc.


[23-Nov-24 11:10 PM] antisyntax#0000
it sure would free up a lot of time being able to automate shipping and moving around resources lol


[23-Nov-24 11:11 PM] tanda#0000
I honestly doubt it. For a game this niche, it is unlikely that they'll upgrade their servers much further. Even a couple basic trading scripts would likely be able to crash the server easily


[23-Nov-24 11:11 PM] antisyntax#0000
you think?


[23-Nov-24 11:11 PM] antisyntax#0000
Just from the increased activity, or...?


[23-Nov-24 11:12 PM] tanda#0000
Just from the volume of demands such scripts would be able to pass to the server. We currently already have issues and memory leaks infrequently (we are in early access after all). But the devs already kinda took their stance on "nothing automated can pass commands to the server"


[23-Nov-24 11:12 PM] antisyntax#0000
aww oaky


[23-Nov-24 11:12 PM] tanda#0000
Which I really don't expect them to deviate much from (and yeah they can really bog down a server easily)


[23-Nov-24 11:13 PM] antisyntax#0000
even if they restricted the amount of actions / calls per hour?


[23-Nov-24 11:13 PM] tanda#0000
Nothing is stopping you from using a custom setup to pull data off the FIO API and abuse xit actions to minimize your contribution


[23-Nov-24 11:13 PM] antisyntax#0000
XIT Actions?


[23-Nov-24 11:13 PM] tanda#0000
you should see some of the excel sheets some of the old timers have


[23-Nov-24 11:14 PM] antisyntax#0000
yeah i'm working on an spread sheet, but since its in Numbers (and not Excel or Sheets), i can't import live data, so i'm making a discord bot to pull price data so i can just easily look at the message and update the spreadsheet


[23-Nov-24 11:14 PM] tanda#0000
PMMG has a command called "Xit Action" which is basically a script that can execute a series of moving/buying commands almost entirely. STill requires the user to hit the button to finish the action, though

[23-Nov-24 11:16 PM] antisyntax#0000
its just easier with the implimentation, but that's getting off-topic


[23-Nov-24 11:16 PM] antisyntax#0000
and can this be implimented into a Python script somehow?


[23-Nov-24 11:16 PM] tanda#0000
Not sure? I'm pretty well out of the coding game by about a decade. All of it is starting to look like wizardry again


[23-Nov-24 11:17 PM] antisyntax#0000
although honestly buying and moving items isn't the problem. its shipping things every day. I don't have that much time to play but every few days, so i like the idea of taking a week or two break and knowing that my shipments aren't getting backed up, since they need babied a lot more often than consumables


[23-Nov-24 11:18 PM] antisyntax#0000
like i can buy a month of consumables and just do other stuff for a few weeks, but i need to constantly give shipping commands, since i only have two ships


[23-Nov-24 11:18 PM] tanda#0000
As far as idle games go, this one is pretty not idle


[23-Nov-24 11:18 PM] antisyntax#0000
or else i'll be suffering for weeks after, constantly shipping and hoping nothing gets too full/backed up


[23-Nov-24 11:19 PM] antisyntax#0000
i mean i know its not an idle game, its just, the reason i took a few months off (and regretted it because everything decayed and i lost a LOT of equity), is because once you get more than 1-2 bases, things take a LOT of time and mental focus to manage


[23-Nov-24 11:19 PM] antisyntax#0000
that's why i believe being able to automate some of the more tedious stuff will free me up to be able to worry about expansions


[23-Nov-24 11:19 PM] tanda#0000
But yeah, xit actions is pretty targeted at those with multiple ships and 15+ bases who have to manage the mental overhead of figuring out *what* to ship during their play windows

like if it was just AL, i could sit back and do a shipment every week or so


[23-Nov-24 11:22 PM] antisyntax#0000
the problem is, besides spreading consumables across the bases, is moving resources across PROD lines

More storage makes life easier stock more. Sell stuff on your planet you produce

Not going to say it's the right way? But I religiously avoid transporting ALO


[23-Nov-24 11:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
i mean i've got some STOs, and i'm selling the AL pretty much every day or two, its just constantly moving ships around the three bases


[23-Nov-24 11:24 PM] tanda#0000
I source from the LM or from partners I know who already import. It cuts down my shipping a lot


[23-Nov-24 11:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
that would be nice, but isn't ALO kinda expensive?


[23-Nov-24 11:24 PM] finestone#0000
yeah Im just saying is there a way to make it so you dont have to move ships constanly?


[23-Nov-24 11:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
maybe once my products stockpile enough i can start sending full ships

[23-Nov-24 11:25 PM] antisyntax#0000
but right now i was kinda backlogged on GRN & HCP, so i let harmonia run dry of consumables until i got more storage


[23-Nov-24 11:25 PM] antisyntax#0000
and now i gotta build it back up since nascent is starting to run low for the INCs


[23-Nov-24 11:25 PM] antisyntax#0000
but even so im moving ships around on a daily or bi-daily basis


[23-Nov-24 11:25 PM] finestone#0000
I run 2-3 STO on all bases for this reason and buy all warehouse slots


[23-Nov-24 11:25 PM] tanda#0000
so my Nascent base does nothing but (used to) run Single Burn GRN to C. It helps cut down that route so that you're only sending a ship to Harmonia> Nascent every 5 days rather than having to do that + Run another ship out to Nascent and back every two days for ALO pickup.

guess i *will* be playing PRUN on Chrome after all (sigh)


[24-Nov-24 12:22 AM] antisyntax#0000
its still a little weird since Apple likes higher DPI than the monitor has, so the text is a bit hard to read, but i got it to where its somewhat readable, just may give me eye strain after a while

Salary

wouldn't project staff just be project members ?

"yet". volunteer positions, payment is in service

All the ddt and ns I bathe in


[25-Nov-24 02:37 PM] jvaler#0000
staff helps with the operations of the server, stuff like role management and posting to information/announcement channels
coordinator is meant to mostly represent who runs/organizes co-op projects, like stuff under CULT or contributors to AGP. the idea is they get perms for co-op information channels, but i think the perms are all fucked up rn


[25-Nov-24 02:39 PM] jvaler#0000
when making staff i just rolled over anyone who was coordinator into staff, as that was previously their effective role. so there's some staff that probably shouldn't be staff as they aren't quite as active in ADI


[25-Nov-24 02:39 PM] jvaler#0000
but i'd feel bad de-roleing them, and it's not really hurting anybody so


[25-Nov-24 02:40 PM] astra1414#0000
understandable


[25-Nov-24 02:41 PM] astra1414#0000
the role colours look more uniform


[25-Nov-24 02:41 PM] jvaler#0000

Coordinators used to be a bright yellow üü®


[25-Nov-24 02:42 PM] jvaler#0000
still is, it's just staff color takes precedence. if someone had coordinator but not staff they'd be yellow


[25-Nov-24 02:42 PM] jvaler#0000
do you wanna be yellow? =P


[25-Nov-24 02:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
For what it‚Äôs worth, I think the orange-red is appropriately ominous üòé

[25-Nov-24 02:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, I‚Äôd never say no to a purely cosmetic role


[25-Nov-24 02:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it‚Äôs probably better that I stay this color - less confusing for everyone üòÑ


[25-Nov-24 02:43 PM] astra1414#0000
so what im hearing is you are requesting a permanent sidemotion to coordinator for the role colour.

for the sake of diplomacy i don't think ADI should recognize etherwind as our territory. laaxus is just a rogue agent

hold on, i just realized something. Us antares folk are descended from martian terraformers according to the handbook


[25-Nov-24 02:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
and earth was destroyed by a killer asteroid which is why it's not in the game (afaik)


[25-Nov-24 02:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
but what happened to mars?


[25-Nov-24 02:56 PM] astra1414#0000
id guess it depends entirely on how self-sufficient mars was before it all happened


[25-Nov-24 02:57 PM] astra1414#0000
iirc it does state that although antares left for the new space early they got there last because of technological differences


[25-Nov-24 02:57 PM] astra1414#0000
whether or not mars would've survived on its own if it had a significant technological difference i dont really know


[25-Nov-24 02:58 PM] astra1414#0000
maybe it's still out there and if we unify the galaxy we get to go home or something, that'd be cool

Basically fancy savings account where you can‚Äôt remove the money until the term is up


[25-Nov-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
You deposit money for a fixed term, if you pull out early you lose the interest. If you keep in, you have a higher than standard interest rate


[25-Nov-24 03:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
fwiw, you can get savings accounts at several places that are tied to the federal funds rate


[25-Nov-24 03:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Some do allow you to add more money as you want (while the term is valid)


[25-Nov-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
Though I'll admit i (incorrectly) read this as 6%

10% interest doesnt make you any money if it bankrupts your lendee

well my bulletin post specifies 3%, but they ask for stuff like 8 week repayment on an interest style loan where they pay 33% of the loan in interest


[25-Nov-24 03:50 PM] tanda#0000
Hey, it keeps the payments flat and that's really useful


[25-Nov-24 03:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Brb gonna go find the old loan CONT


[25-Nov-24 03:52 PM] jvaler#0000
more so it keeps payments low at the penalty of high interest. if you just want to keep payments flat you go for annuity


[25-Nov-24 03:53 PM] tanda#0000
Oh I thought that's what you were talking abour

if you think about it is actually quite healthy. you give x amount to someone, they use it to do y and they end up with z extra money. they pay you back more than you gave them while they make more, and so now you can continue on giving loans and continue the cycle

[28-Nov-24 12:03 AM] finestone#0000
Or maybe optimize your bases to reduce shipping üôÇ


[28-Nov-24 12:27 AM] evov#0000
People (especially newer players) very heavily under-estimate the cost of providing logistics (ships) to run their bases.

This is a list I made showing the capital cost of ships required to cover each process. ( real costs will vary depending on flight times/fuel use )

If you're short on ships, stay away from the top of the list, lean into the bottom of the list imo.

My suggestion is to just include the Price of a ship when planning your base


[28-Nov-24 12:34 AM] laaxus#0000
If you need a 2k/2k once a week to supply your base, add 1/7th of a New 2k/2k as part of your roi calculation

[28-Nov-24 06:17 AM] jcheung#0000
technically there's ways to adjust the shipping cost


[28-Nov-24 06:18 AM] jcheung#0000
although


[28-Nov-24 06:18 AM] jcheung#0000
what's the other criteria for this? what distance is stuff being shipped? how much time does this cover?


[28-Nov-24 01:39 PM] evov#0000
These are the baseline shipping costs I used. They will differ a lot based on what you're doing. The relevant point isn't the raw cost of it but the relative cost  i.e. recognizing that some things are MORE costly vs LESS costly to set up.

It does use MFL tanks so that's a bit odd, but it still works good on 90% of applications


[28-Nov-24 03:12 PM] antisyntax#0000
3%. is this 3% interest, or 3% weekly payments?


[28-Nov-24 03:14 PM] jvaler#0000
3% interest that compounds weekly

the interest alone is 70% of my total net profits for a 6mil loan

that sounds like your repayment period is too long then, or you're using the interest loan type

@jvaler are you okay with a 20-week loan for 6mil (8.22mil after interest)?


[28-Nov-24 06:23 PM] antisyntax#0000
i know im paying my arm and leg for interest, but thats the highest length I can do, and its still 411k / week, which is about 30%-ish interest (yikes)


[28-Nov-24 06:23 PM] antisyntax#0000
but idk if you are okay with a loan that long


[28-Nov-24 06:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
(annuity loan iirc)

[28-Nov-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
what's the repayment rate you're looking at for the annuity loan?


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
i did whatever loan was the same amount every month


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
7 day, 20 weeks, 3%


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] jvaler#0000
right that's annuity


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] jvaler#0000
but what repayment rate setting


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh. its 20 weeks, so i guess 0.05


[28-Nov-24 06:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
i tried to do a 26-week to make it an even half-year, but it only let me do 20 max

[28-Nov-24 06:50 PM] antisyntax#0000
i have no idea where i got my math from


[28-Nov-24 06:51 PM] antisyntax#0000
i produce 200 AL / day. at 700 AIC (even though its 720 right now), thats 140k... a day.


[28-Nov-24 06:51 PM] antisyntax#0000
That's almost a million a week


[28-Nov-24 06:51 PM] antisyntax#0000
so i could wait 6 weeks to get a ship, or be in debt for 20

[28-Nov-24 06:54 PM] antisyntax#0000
but if i make a million a week gross, i'll just wait a few months and buy a ship cash


[28-Nov-24 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
i have no idea what it actually means lmfao
i just know higher = higher payments, shorter time


[28-Nov-24 06:54 PM] antisyntax#0000
that way im not paying 8 million for a 6 million ship, and paying for it over 20 weeks

[28-Nov-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
You already have to transport the AL, right?


[28-Nov-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
drop a base on Nike and upcycle your AL into BSE/BBH


[28-Nov-24 06:55 PM] antisyntax#0000
yes. i'm doing a Harmonia>Nascent>Deimos>ANT run


[28-Nov-24 06:55 PM] jvaler#0000
what base is this LCB for anyways?


[28-Nov-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
That'll make a faster profit turnaround and leave you with a decent base for further expansion


[28-Nov-24 06:56 PM] antisyntax#0000
the LCB is to help reduce the load of ALO to Deimos


[28-Nov-24 06:56 PM] tanda#0000
and require roughly the same amount of shipping


[28-Nov-24 06:56 PM] antisyntax#0000
basically 2 ships move around the loop


[28-Nov-24 06:56 PM] antisyntax#0000
the third ship is for moving consumables, repair supplies, new bases, etc.


[28-Nov-24 06:56 PM] antisyntax#0000
the reason i chose the LCB is it holds more ALO than the WCB


[28-Nov-24 06:57 PM] tanda#0000
I never did ALO on Nascent, but I was able to manage the Harmonia>Nascent>Deimos route with two 500/500 ships

[28-Nov-24 06:58 PM] jvaler#0000
how are you managing it currently? LM shipping?


[28-Nov-24 06:58 PM] tanda#0000
I think that's probably a better short term change. Shipping contracts can help a LOT with short termish shipping issues


[28-Nov-24 06:59 PM] antisyntax#0000

[28-Nov-24 06:59 PM] jvaler#0000

i like the idea of not suffering for weeks if i take a few days off lol


[28-Nov-24 07:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
but i *just barely* have more logistics than i have items to move around


[28-Nov-24 07:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
so i can technically run two ships every day and be fine


[28-Nov-24 07:00 PM] antisyntax#0000

Another suggestion would be to increase the amount of INC you have on Nascent, reduce the amount of EXT


[28-Nov-24 07:01 PM] jvaler#0000
darkfuel has WCBs/LCBs that they use for 30k+ AIC contracts
if you dm them to let them know you posted LM ads to deimos/nascent they'll (probably) reliably run them for you. i'd bump the price up to like 35-40k though given ANT -> nascent -> deimos and possibly -> ANT again is more than a 2 leg trip

[28-Nov-24 07:02 PM] antisyntax#0000

source half of your ALO from LM on Deimos at market rates or above ask

other than consumables ofc


[28-Nov-24 07:04 PM] antisyntax#0000
not to mention, i've got my building ratios out so that i rarely have excess. if i source half my ALO, then my nascent base will be idling too much

They do also get filled on Deimos too, often by people with mining bases on Nascent


[28-Nov-24 07:07 PM] antisyntax#0000
so, tldr: buy some ALO locally/ANT CX, build a Nike base for BFABS, sell excess materials, engage in shipping contracts, and wait on getting a third ship?


[28-Nov-24 07:08 PM] antisyntax#0000
maybe buy some consumables from internal so i'm not spending half my profits on food lol


[28-Nov-24 07:08 PM] tanda#0000
If it's this much of a stretch to pay for a new ship, I definitely think so. I didn't buy an LCB until roughly base 6?

[28-Nov-24 07:09 PM] antisyntax#0000
and once i get some stockpiled mats, i can run the ships less often, and fill them before sending them

And you already need a 3rd ship?


[29-Nov-24 02:54 AM] antisyntax#0000
not technically yet, i plan on getting a fourth base, and will definately need it then


[29-Nov-24 02:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That‚Äôs harsh


[29-Nov-24 02:55 AM] antisyntax#0000
mainly because the time between stops is so long, that by the time my loop comes around to the same base, its long been starved of materials for my PROD lines


[29-Nov-24 02:55 AM] antisyntax#0000
and i can't even think of taking a day or two off or everything backs up

It is good to see that our that our in-house #bankers are making good use of my tools. (FYI : an updated sheet was dropped via https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1247251299620225087/1307774936060002304 , which fixed a few bugs).

There are two ways to increase your daily ROIs...

1) Increase the #thickness of the loans. (I.e. more money dolled out for HQ/ship/buffer upgrades).

2) Increase the #length of the loans. (I.e. more terms, up to the max that can be had via in-game CONTD buffers --- **stable** and **annuity** type loans are actually compounding in nature, whereas **interest** loans are simple interest, over the loan term. --- glhf?)


[29-Nov-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
yes i absolutely love your calculator, and ty again @jcheung for the bugfixing


[29-Nov-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
your calc is one of the reasons i opened up my loan offer lol


[29-Nov-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
makes it so much easier to understand


[29-Nov-24 07:49 PM] jvaler#0000
and faster to test loan parameters


[29-Nov-24 07:51 PM] jcheung#0000
was an easy fix, the hard part would have been making it üòâ


[30-Nov-24 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I remember that we talked about about Antares being so expensive


[30-Nov-24 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, it seems like MOR is the most expensive cx to me


[30-Nov-24 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
Maybe it's only for what I'm producing


[30-Nov-24 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
but I get much larger return by just exporting there


[30-Nov-24 08:35 AM] jvaler#0000
that's always been morian propaganda üôÑ


[30-Nov-24 08:36 AM] jvaler#0000
(i have no idea i have no reason to interact with that CX lol)


[30-Nov-24 08:41 AM] realharvey#0000
But when evverything is more expensive there is it even worth getting that currency?


[30-Nov-24 08:44 AM] jcheung#0000
some input materials are cheaper up there


[30-Nov-24 08:44 AM] jcheung#0000
that said it's so damn far i only go out there because i end up there for other reasons


[30-Nov-24 08:44 AM] laaxus#0000
The FX rate is close enough to 1


[30-Nov-24 08:45 AM] laaxus#0000
and you can pay large bill in any currency (shipbuilders and other)


[30-Nov-24 09:56 AM] jvaler#0000
you can also ship IDC/EDC to convert currencies

[01-Dec-24 07:00 PM] jvaler#0000
OH i get it, you had to build your base before POPR ticked over, so the previous period had a bunch of open jobs that were already going to get filled by the existing population

[02-Dec-24 08:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
problem is that it's required in large quantities and very inconsistent since it goes to production of crew quarters which are only needed in specific amount


[02-Dec-24 08:57 AM] realharvey#0000
Roh's statement is right. But due to low player count the "you will get buyers" part can take quite a while. I check out opportunities for new bases like once a month and if there is a well priced input good in decent stock I'll decide to source it from the cx instead of doing it myself


[02-Dec-24 08:59 AM] marat_sh#0000
üíØ % Lower player count doesn't help with the problem


[02-Dec-24 09:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
I do wish PPF products were more available on the market because you need really weird amounts of them for electronics. I'm sure there would be enough demand out there for a few bases if all the electronics peeps stopped making their own (I'm part of that problem üòÑ )


[02-Dec-24 09:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[02-Dec-24 09:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But... The overall architecture of in-game economic/production I/Os is definitely not helping... You've usually got your outputs following a hierarchical method of production from lower tiers --> higher tiers... And even when you get to those higher tiers, the applications are incredibly niche. (basically only shipbuilding, high tier POPI upgrades, and HQ fabs, across all connected industries)...

This is also underlies the basic consumables, across all tiers, which are usually locked behind higher processes..


[02-Dec-24 09:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
major problem with vertical integration is lack of BIDs


[02-Dec-24 09:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Farming / Food Industries has a nice mix though. Many basic things get cycled through a PIO workforce, and the rest (even if they require TECs to get the inputs), are then cycled in through SETs, for the final retail products. Other things are much worse... AML/ASM loops? PIOs for extraction/smelting, and then straight to TEC/ENGs for refinement, and then back to say TECs for final retail production.


[02-Dec-24 09:43 AM] realharvey#0000
and people dont put up bids because it binds a lot of their liquid cash into that until some one decides "oh thats enough demand lets produce it"


[02-Dec-24 09:56 AM] moke.#0000
People are also impatient and will just buy the cheapest that's already there to do whatever quickly


[02-Dec-24 10:01 AM] laaxus#0000

Comparative advantage
Comparative advantage in an economic model is the advantage over others in producing a particular good. A good can be produced at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade. Comparative advantage describes the economic reality of the gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nation...


[02-Dec-24 10:19 AM] marat_sh#0000
I also wish that permit area was not a thing, but instead you have 100% organization for productivity and it will decrees the % of organization with additional buildings until you get to -99% organization malice and have to create a new base


[02-Dec-24 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000

Oh he had buy orders to buy RATs and no sell orders, so it's even worse than people buying stock and reposting it, the plan was to buy the stock and delete the RATs. So by puttins MM Rats into his very high buy order, you can at least get the buy orders off the table

we gotta do something about the C prices in ANT. Idk how, but we gotta do something. It costs the same amount as AL, which makes it unprofitable for anyone w/o a INC base. New players won't want to make AL if it doesn't make any money. If they buy C at 701 and sell AL at 701, where's the money for consumables?


[03-Dec-24 08:59 AM] antisyntax#0000

Not really - when I started 3 months ago, 700-750 was a totaly normal price. Back then, allocator even sat on the market and regulated it. I gues after the recent attacks, they left

C market was back then even considered really stable


[03-Dec-24 09:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000

I just crossed a personal milestone in the game that I felt like sharing. I raw dog the game with no addons so I don't have any "line goes up" graphs showing net worth etc. But, I have been manually tracking my cash + holdings at each of the CX warehouses for a while, doing a stock take and updating once per week. I've finally crossed into the triple comma club of cash + CX stock.

My last 3 weeks, and today finally crossing that line.

Doesn't include ships/permits/bases/stock on bases etc etc. Just cash on hand and current CX value of stock in the 4 main CX warehouses. But it's been a good "financial health" measurement I've been using for a while now.

[07-Dec-24 03:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah. Most of the starter planets have a revolving-door phenomenon with their plot figures. Most of the people on them are TRIALs (like 80-->90%). They're quickly kicked out once they lose interest in the game and no longer log in regularly. It'll be the third time I've seen Deimos being open/closed to non-starter colonists, since like ~1 or ~1.5 years ago.

SF.AI1 has more between it and the MM, but the price is even closer to it relative to FF

Well, I can definitely say I'm not going to start producing Fuel personally, do you think this might be worth a CULT project?

are they all for INS? and how many chem planets do you need for that much THF?


[11-Dec-24 12:52 AM] tanda#0000
one LAB base supplies enough THF for 5.5 INS bases. I'm still relying on sidepipe for now, but I know I gotta get my own supply

I only have 4 INS bases right now though

I think we need like, an economic allert channel or soemthing. Where people can raise the alarms if any sector of our CX is under attack. There's plenty of proud Antarean's with sizable private holdings of a lot of resources, collectively we can stabilize most potential threats - the issue is knowing about it because tbh, I don't spend a lot of time looking through the markets.

Not sure if I want to be pinged everytime someone thinks something is too expensive haha. But yeah... I think market price awareness is a good "crowd sourced" comodity, and serves a win win transaction -   People with spare stock get to sell into an above average priced market. People looking to buy get availability + price lowered.

Now that my IDC base loan is repaid, I'd like to use the money it prints to create potential markets on the ANT cx

For example, I'm planning to produce PPF product at a low price, and put it on the market, even if it's not bought

to create a stock, until people feel like they can rely on it

And i'd like your thoughts on other potential bases like this


[13-Dec-24 04:36 AM] laaxus#0000

I feel like the only one in town, who wasn‚Äôt in the new cool club yet, without any IDC base. It feels like everybody has one. üòÖ
But I kinda hate the thought of one. They are just printing money. In a game sense, that‚Äôs great, but as for the markets and communities, that‚Äôs really not doing much.

(Not judging)


[13-Dec-24 07:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Either way - I think I want to generally go into resource extraction and refinement, so LIO is something on my radar


[13-Dec-24 07:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I decided to only get one (the allocater one) and to use the money it prints to develop antares


[13-Dec-24 07:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It just takes too much shipping capacity I don‚Äôt have as of now


[13-Dec-24 07:49 AM] laaxus#0000
i don't see the point of having a full fleet of IDC base


[13-Dec-24 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
but one IDC base allows me to sell at a loss to create market for example

r.e. IDC bases - I think they have a place. I don't like them from a game design aspect - I dislike the zero input nature of them. But . . . they are in the game, and unfortunately because they have very little reliance on anything else, the best way to diminish their relative strength is to get as many people as possible putting down IDC bases until the rest of the economy inflates to match.

[13-Dec-24 09:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
I personally think it‚Äôs better for MMs to use as much of the economy as possible since they create a basically infinite demand for stuff. But none of the other MMs are even close to the profitability of EDC/IDC in terms of $ per base area per day


[13-Dec-24 09:16 AM] tanda#0000

even HAL has a limit on what you can sell, plus you need to ship it


[13-Dec-24 09:23 AM] razenpok#0000
The risk is in the cost of input goods and repair materials


[13-Dec-24 09:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but you won‚Äôt get rich off a bunch of cheap Halcyon bases with high margin - ROI is meaningless without considering  the size of the investment

[13-Dec-24 09:26 AM] razenpok#0000
That is far from the truth. If an IDC base is smth like 20m, with 300k profit the ROI is almost 2 months

money benefits those closest to creation, therefore IDC owners benefit the most and inflict inflation upon the rest

And you can theoretically achieve that with some other high tech buildings, but not in practice because there‚Äôs not enough demand for the products of those buildings

My main criticism is that we should have to sacrifice more goods to the infinite money pit, not that the pit exists in the first place üòÇ

[13-Dec-24 09:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
There‚Äôs basically two levers that the IDC/EDC affect the economy through - driving up the cost of SCI / ENG upkeep, and introducing more money into the system. The first indirectly increases prices for everything else because it drives demand for upkeep items, fabs, etc. The second is inflation and is basically magic to me. But if we‚Äôre concluding that the point of those MMs is to drive growth in the economy by being an infinite money pit (which is sort of what I‚Äôve settled on), wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense if it used more stuff, and did so more directly?

If you make the money tap consume a lot of resources, it will lead to an even bigger inflation


[13-Dec-24 09:37 AM] razenpok#0000
Since it will leave the economy with more money and less goods


[13-Dec-24 09:38 AM] getonthetrain#0000
but you see, the whole of the economy would be involved so everyone is affected and everyone also benefits


[13-Dec-24 09:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs fine, inflation is healthy for a growing economy

the IDC logistics chain benefits only a small portion of the game, with some 2nd layer production during building or repairs


[13-Dec-24 09:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs a big part of why it‚Äôs still in the game tbh.


[13-Dec-24 09:40 AM] razenpok#0000
That's basically irl money-printing :kekw:


[13-Dec-24 09:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
Look, I‚Äôm not saying that EDC/IDC isn‚Äôt a good (or at least acceptable) solution to providing the game with currency and some amount of infinite demand so there‚Äôs always _someplace_ to sell your stuff. I just think there can be better solutions (from the perspective of a player)


[13-Dec-24 09:42 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Exactly, IDC works - but there are better ways to do it that involve everyone in the game from starter player to OG's


[13-Dec-24 09:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
The other MMs exist, I just wish they were way more profitable than IDC so there was a rational incentive to go through all the trouble of making the goods


[13-Dec-24 09:45 AM] getonthetrain#0000
That would be a start


[13-Dec-24 09:46 AM] razenpok#0000
The problem here is that if you make low-tier MMs more profitable than high-tier MMs, people will just stick with low-tier MMs


[13-Dec-24 09:46 AM] razenpok#0000
So it should be other high-tier MMs


[13-Dec-24 09:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I mean - AIR, LOG, stuff like that


[13-Dec-24 09:47 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Laaxus and I have said from the start it should be ship components


[13-Dec-24 09:47 AM] getonthetrain#0000
which touch the entire production chain and give everyone a chance to benefit from


[13-Dec-24 09:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think we can all agree that making 300k / day off the RAT MM probably wouldn‚Äôt be ideal


[13-Dec-24 09:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
I guess I should clarify that i don‚Äôt think anyone making non-MM goods is irrational. I just mean IDC is a rational choice over the other high-tier MMs because it‚Äôs less work for more money üòÑ


[13-Dec-24 09:56 AM] razenpok#0000
Hmm, I think the problem with having a long chain of materials leading to money printing is supply chain issues. If you somehow disrupt money-printing, it will (in time) lead to deflation, which is bad for economy and trading


[13-Dec-24 09:56 AM] razenpok#0000
With shorter chain there's less chance of disruption


[13-Dec-24 09:56 AM] razenpok#0000
Noooo, you just called us irrational and we are having a holy war

But that would be a more interesting market indeed


[13-Dec-24 10:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
Plus I think you can mitigate that by having a few different high-level MMs that are all profitable. The current system is theoretically just as vulnerable to that

Yep, IDC/EDC are as vulnerable, just less so

you're missing the point that people that make non-MM items above resource extraction face  all the same risks as MM goods without the benefit

For example, at some point you need fuel


[13-Dec-24 10:09 AM] razenpok#0000
And you need to make it, then ship it


[13-Dec-24 10:09 AM] razenpok#0000
You need ships, etc


[13-Dec-24 10:09 AM] getonthetrain#0000
you would need more fuel to make actual goods


[13-Dec-24 10:10 AM] getonthetrain#0000
therefore benefiting the fuel makers more

[13-Dec-24 10:10 AM] razenpok#0000
I don't understand this point, sorry


[13-Dec-24 10:11 AM] getonthetrain#0000
to make ship components or any high level good you would ship more often and therefore use more fuel


[13-Dec-24 10:12 AM] getonthetrain#0000
from raw resources to smelting to manufacturing to electronics to construction or back to smelting or manufacting planet, etc


[13-Dec-24 10:12 AM] razenpok#0000
That's on the surface. Don't forget that you need to feed SCI and repair SL, and that's a whole chain in itself which requires fuel and everything else


[13-Dec-24 10:13 AM] getonthetrain#0000
tiny compared to everything else

You've got numbers for that? (I don't, just vibes)


[13-Dec-24 10:13 AM] getonthetrain#0000
you disagree that IDC supply chain uses far less than ship components supply chain?


[13-Dec-24 10:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
you could quantify all the things that go into an IDC. SCI upkeep, fabs, repair materials, upkeep for the planet, fuel for the shipping at every step including what goes into the planet upkeep and parts for that, etc etc.

[13-Dec-24 10:14 AM] getonthetrain#0000
ship component supply chain also uses SCI pops


[13-Dec-24 10:14 AM] getonthetrain#0000
in addition to every other pop level


[13-Dec-24 10:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
i get your point that IDC indirectly touches everything, but the other MMs are more direct because they use more goods, which use more pops and bases, which use more shipping, etc etc


[13-Dec-24 10:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
that's sort of what I mean - IDC does everything I want an MM to do, but it does it too indirectly


[13-Dec-24 10:15 AM] sidepipe#0000

[13-Dec-24 10:15 AM] razenpok#0000

[13-Dec-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
The issue with IDC is that they are not forced to inject the money it generates back into the economy


[13-Dec-24 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
so theorically, one player could just see its AIC number go up and few things would change

Again, fair, and would look more interesting


[13-Dec-24 10:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
From a player perspective, I want the game to reward me for moving up the supply chain and making more advanced things (and that's because I personally find the production more interesting than making money). But there are huge parts of the tech / production tree of the game that just have very limited demand eventhough they have MMs because they're just so much less profitable than IDC. The rational choice for me is to convert most / all of my bases to IDC and just rake in that cash forever. But I think it would be good for the economy of the game to more strongly encourage making those complicated items, because for AIR / LOG / Ship Part you make, there's so many inputs that you basically can't do it on your own. You need to choose a point to stop making extra bases and just buy goods from the market

[13-Dec-24 10:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
I like the fact that they've been re-evaluating some of the MM prices. I think it'd be great if they continued with that - it wouldn't be fair to just drop EDC/ IDC out from under everyone, but if the profitability steadily got worse and encouraged folks to diversify to the other MMs, that would be a good thing. I don't envy trying to balance that though

yeah, that's where the balance comes in. trying to make a bunch of different MMs _roughly_ equivalent while dealing with the fact that prices for the different inputs fluctuate would be a lot. I still think it'd be a better result if the new status quo was just a more complicated (i.e. more inputs) MM, but my dream is that a couple different choices would be viable enough that you wouldn't see the huge concentration we do now

Well I think the MM bids were supposed to be a way for people to clear out inventories on some of the more complex POPI upgrade/upkeep materials, since running those BUIs without an adequate market is harsh on your ROIs and weekly revenues... 

But once the fab/consumable markets for those higher end processes became more available/cheaper, and people realised just how minimal work those EDC/IDC were for the returns... 

(not ROI metrics, but capital turnover, or huge capital investments, which then churn out much higher permit revenue metrics than basic processes),...

then it sorta got out of control imo... (fyi we're looking at a doubling of global currencies in circulation, from 01-2024, to 12-2024) üò¢

I think there's 2 completely separate lines of thought people are going down.  1. Are zero input MM's good vs bad for the game.   2. Are zero input MM's good vs bad for WINNING at the game.

Unless anyone here is a Dev, 1. seems somewhat irrelevant.

Ultimately, EDC/IDC farms are somewhat immune from "attack". I've tried. And it's a fruitless endeavor. The only way to diminish their relative strength, is to inflate the rest of the economy to match their profitability ( or convince Dev's to continue nerfing them ). Having more people make EDC/IDC's, seems to me to be the shortest path on both those failure modes.

They make good $/base numbers, but their RoI isn't great. If you're constrained by #permits - IDC's make a lot of sense. If you're constrained by $$ they're not that great of an idea.

Ultimately they‚Äôre the rational action for endgame players, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good thing


[13-Dec-24 06:00 PM] roche3950#0000
There should be no convergence point, so to speak, for people to end up focusing on no matter what path they take in the game

I would consider myself an "end game" player. I have 37 bases. Only 2 of them are IDC bases.

[13-Dec-24 06:20 PM] igfloz#0000
Surely currency and market revolve around
a) Player numbers
b) MAT availability on the CX 

Some of the conversations up above  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  don't seem to take any of this into account, they seem to read as an expansive explanation, without really explaining anything. I think I must be pretty dumb as I don't understand most of what has been said previously.

I'm not looking for another expansive explanation (which I won't understand) - I just look at demand vs availability. EDC / IDC is just a golden goose in my opinion. If it keeps laying, I'll keep feeding


[13-Dec-24 08:03 PM] roche3950#0000
It *is* a golden goose


[13-Dec-24 08:04 PM] roche3950#0000
and it‚Äôs entirely rational to keep feeding it while it lays


[13-Dec-24 08:04 PM] roche3950#0000

Lol igfloz.... Thanks for putting a smile on my face, and making my weekend just a little bit better. But I'm like 100% dumber than you. Satisfaction Guaranteed. üòõ

As with life -- if it ain't broke, then don't fix it.


[14-Dec-24 07:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But the devs are not publishing all of the metrics that can be found in their database, so that Prun stays as a **game**, and doesn't turn into the lunch room of an economics department at your local university. 

Everything else, like global in-game stuff, is just out of any player's/corp's control, and should be irrelevant unless someone is trying to play g*d.

*But sometimes the discussions in here are a little interesting. They help my brain JUI'ces FLO, even though it's just one big mush anyways.* :/

[14-Dec-24 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
How much TCO do you consume per day ?


[14-Dec-24 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
because I feel like one base would be enough to supply the whole universe


[14-Dec-24 01:17 PM] tanda#0000
it probably would! I only use 3 TCO a day to run 2 TNPs

it's not a great plan


[14-Dec-24 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
but it's a plan nonetheless


[14-Dec-24 01:19 PM] laaxus#0000
with 3 TCO per day, you're good for a year with 2-3 of production of full production


[14-Dec-24 01:19 PM] laaxus#0000
so you could just drop a base


[14-Dec-24 01:19 PM] laaxus#0000
mine for a week


[14-Dec-24 01:20 PM] laaxus#0000
send the WCB back with the base materials, and enough TCO for half a year


[14-Dec-24 01:21 PM] tanda#0000
or bribe someone with a TIO base on SE-648c to just run TCO for a 2 days

But I think I'm getting more fun, with looking into the company names + "lore" involved... Bumblr Industries @ FLX.AI1... A mix between Bumble (wow it's a dating app, wtf!?), and Tumblr.. 

Bumble and tumble in the markets you may, but in a month  you shall find the humble way? (short term market manipulation never work out).

I kind of do this for personal use. I aim to keep 100+ days of consumes + repairs on hand in ANT. When there are price spikes / market shortages, I'll dip into this supply to help stabilize/profit from the market instability.

For reference - this is my list of consumes/repairs. How much I'm aiming to hold, how much I have, black/red to let me know how much I can sell / how much I should be trying to buy. I update this list once a week.

[15-Dec-24 07:26 PM] evov#0000
I have no idea what the market value is, but it's somewhere in the 300mil region. I suspect there's a few other ANT based players that have a similar stockpile. So I think half of the instability issue could be resolved with a "market watch" type channel, since there's already quite a lot of volume sitting in people's warehouses imo... just need up to date info / knowledge of market fuckery in order to react to it.

IDC related questions just get dodged :D


[18-Dec-24 12:29 PM] tanda#0000
It's far too much a hot topic for them to address directly


[18-Dec-24 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000
Part 1 :
- they've been struggling to find influencers to advertise the game, but now they've started working with an agency and hope it helps increasing the number of player
- German translation being completed allowed them to put the "german" tag on steam, which helped a bit. They will integrate community translation once they're done
- They talked about politic and parliament slightly but I was looking at something else,  but they're really satisfied how people are actually running for parliament
- One day, they'll incorporate the parliament context (aka systems) into corporations 
- They like the external tool, they copied burn rate from pmmg because he believes that's great for every player, they're a bit depressed to see how some can develop new features so fast (joking)
- Roadmap has been updated
- They present the new Roadmap (honestly just go read it)
- Multi item contract is planned


[18-Dec-24 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000

The government of KI-401b is currently offering an incentive initiative due to high unemployment. This is a metallurgy planet with good concentrations of FEO, ZIR and TIO. We have 600 Techs whose bases have since closed down and need jobs! The planet is under new management now and we will work hard to keep your buildings fully employed! (Me and Okawari)

We are offering a 50k grant for placing a new base and an additional 50k grant for using some of the available Techs on a new or existing base. I will be offering SEA at 100/u and Tanda is offering INS at 110/u. 

This has been posted on the Bulletin-Board and will up for quite some time, So if its still up there it is still active. Thanks All!

I can't find where the previous discussion on PE was. I feel like it might have been in the now removed members section of this discord, maybe it was somewhere else. Either way - I have .... plenty... of PE.. I'll keep dumping it into the market till the price gets back under 10 or 11/unit

[23-Dec-24 07:39 PM] evov#0000
If it gets up to 700/u I've got around 5k PT I can use to ensure supply. Until then, I feel like it's worth it to just let the BMP enjoyers have a little bit of a payday.


[23-Dec-24 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000

[24-Dec-24 01:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
They bought a couple big batches at like 14/u and are now selling at 9


[24-Dec-24 04:47 PM] evov#0000
Yea, there's not really much else you can do. Just keep reposting smallish batches so they don't get any sales + start up production to try to fill in the gap that they're buying.

I keep re-posting flx every time I log on, but sometimes it just gets cleared.

Looks like I'm going to need some extra helping hands to settle Kevin and KI-401c before too long


[26-Dec-24 07:05 PM] finestone#0000
what did you have in mind?


[26-Dec-24 07:06 PM] tanda#0000
It looks like I need some PIO consumption on both planets and I also have enough pop on Kevin for a whole other base of PP3


[26-Dec-24 07:07 PM] tanda#0000
honestly if someone were to copy my Rfab setup and plop it onto one of the planets it would work pretty well

why is KI-401 wrecking my ship


[26-Dec-24 08:54 PM] tanda#0000
it's only 2.6 micrometeroid


[26-Dec-24 09:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is it a gas giant penalty or something?


[26-Dec-24 09:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's a long STL flight, I think it's proportional to duration for that leg. Is that radiation from the K type star? I don't really remember the rules for that


[26-Dec-24 09:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know Hern had reverse engineered all the damage types


[26-Dec-24 09:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see my unshielded ship takes 10x the damage as my shielded one:

1.8% is bonkers though


[26-Dec-24 09:17 PM] tanda#0000
I ask because I just went from KI-401c to Kevin and had similar results


[26-Dec-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
so I *think* it's system related


[26-Dec-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
but Thalassa doesn't eat my ships like this


[26-Dec-24 09:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's solar radiation from kevin being so close to the sun


[26-Dec-24 09:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can replicate it in the BTF


[26-Dec-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
I see that too, but it's still high going 401c to 401d


[26-Dec-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
which is quite a bit further from the sun


[26-Dec-24 09:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm still testing...


[26-Dec-24 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
so are K types just that much stronger radiation? Or do you think a variety of factors are at play?


[26-Dec-24 09:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nah, I just tried them all, whipple shielding is the one that mitigates it from KI-401a to KI-401d


[26-Dec-24 09:22 PM] tanda#0000
oh jeez. So it's just a factor of distance


[26-Dec-24 09:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think so


[26-Dec-24 09:22 PM] tanda#0000
at least whipple shielding is cheaper than radiation shielding


[26-Dec-24 09:22 PM] tanda#0000
... I think


[26-Dec-24 09:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah Akyan is sellin' em cheap on the CX


[26-Dec-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
looks like I should drop that particular ship back to BHP too


[26-Dec-24 09:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
We've got AHP on the books too!


[26-Dec-24 09:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is a STL ship?


[26-Dec-24 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
no, it is FTL capable as well, but considering the expense involved here, I'm just going to dedicate that ship for that area


[26-Dec-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
and yeah, running basically the same setup with BHP and AWH, it's 1/6th the damage sustained


[26-Dec-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not sure I want to go higher plate levels due to the accleration tradeoff


[26-Dec-24 09:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's too bad AHP aren't a bit lighter


[26-Dec-24 09:29 PM] tanda#0000
eh, it looks like it's not even worth it to drop back to BHP


[26-Dec-24 09:30 PM] tanda#0000
.02% less damage


[26-Dec-24 09:30 PM] tanda#0000
nothing like 1.8% per transit vs .3% lol

Is kinda neat


[28-Dec-24 11:30 AM] jvaler#0000
?


[28-Dec-24 11:32 AM] jcheung#0000
It's a way of doing secret santa with nobody knowing the pairs except for the gift giver, not even the organizer


[28-Dec-24 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000
right, what's the way?


[28-Dec-24 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000
You define an order for people to go in
Each person, in order, writes down a pair of numbers
When last is finished, first gets list. Scrambles order. Shifts second half down by one. Swaps the second half of their code with a new number.
Each person can choose to shift down one, or not. Then swap their code with new number.
Last person does not get to shift down, just swap their number
Back to first. Swap first half of code with name. Repeat for all.
List can be publicly posted at this point, i think


[28-Dec-24 11:37 AM] jcheung#0000
Name is the giftee, code is the gifter


[28-Dec-24 11:39 AM] tanda#0000

[28-Dec-24 11:40 AM] jcheung#0000
Granted if one person screws it up, it all breaks


[28-Dec-24 11:43 AM] jcheung#0000
Basically all you need is 3 numbers that identify yourself to you


[28-Dec-24 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
Then you find the correct id each time you get the list and replace the correct part with another thing


[28-Dec-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
I have an easier one


[28-Dec-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
Everybody put its name in a bol


[28-Dec-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000

I know the universe needs COF and all, but it's hard to look at the much higher investment of the HYF/FP base when just DW makes twice the profit


[28-Dec-24 02:55 PM] jvaler#0000
it's what i'm here for


[28-Dec-24 02:58 PM] tanda#0000
The necessary infrastructure to run one full base of COF (while making DW on site to lessen shipping costs) costs 2.3mil and has a total profit per day of 145k
But a FP base on Phobos making just DW still makes 149k per day with only 870k cost

[28-Dec-24 03:48 PM] laaxus#0000

[28-Dec-24 04:00 PM] jcheung#0000
then each traded person knows who potentially held whatever number they handed out

But as long as they don't know the map


[28-Dec-24 04:01 PM] laaxus#0000

ah, so not as simplistic as 1 > 2, 2 > 3?


[28-Dec-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
congrats, you found a different way to do this


[28-Dec-24 04:03 PM] jcheung#0000
except whoever knows the map will also know the pair that he holds, and can potentially affect who gets what

It took a while. But with everyone forever undercutting him I don't think they actually sold too much flx at all really.


[29-Dec-24 06:52 PM] .shiva.#0000
Yeah i doubt it


[29-Dec-24 06:52 PM] .shiva.#0000
Wonder how much he lost buying stuff up then


[29-Dec-24 06:53 PM] .shiva.#0000
I just got another 5k back at 101 from him


[29-Dec-24 06:53 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I appreciate the donation


[29-Dec-24 06:54 PM] .shiva.#0000
And he gave me ~3.5mil for whatever I'd sold before


[29-Dec-24 08:17 PM] jcheung#0000
wow he sold a lot for very very little


[29-Dec-24 08:17 PM] jcheung#0000
coulda just relisted for a reasonable price üòÇ


[30-Dec-24 02:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ohh it's over? Geez.. I was gonna start to root for the guy, since they we're gonna lose in the long term anyways....

That sort of market fixing does work, you just have to be like lowstrife, and provide BUY.CX orders, at margin, against the ASK.CX orders. 

Anything you get sold, you just funnel into the ASK.CX bids you got, which are in-line with everyone else. Huge buy-outs + relists will always fail, unless you're actually going to use the stuff purchased.


[30-Dec-24 11:00 PM] jcheung#0000
well, it probably would have worked if they weren't so greedy


[30-Dec-24 11:45 PM] finestone#0000
Flux is also just a terrible item to do it too.


[30-Dec-24 11:46 PM] jcheung#0000
volume is too high, yeah


[30-Dec-24 11:49 PM] tanda#0000
The items they choose aren't intended to make them money. It's designed to enable a prolonged attack on ANTs economy


[30-Dec-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
they could easily have crept it up like 50-100 and held it there decently


[30-Dec-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
which would have bleed us in the long run


[30-Dec-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
tripling the price just gets people to release stockpiles and change gearing


[30-Dec-24 11:50 PM] tanda#0000
It also encourages new players to quit, and discourages players from expanding into affected industries


[30-Dec-24 11:51 PM] jcheung#0000
that's fair


[30-Dec-24 11:51 PM] jcheung#0000
but like i said, 50-100 increase would likely have done more lasting harm


[30-Dec-24 11:51 PM] tanda#0000
The first part is what concerns me the most


[31-Dec-24 04:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't understand, are you a NCS producer or consummer ? @realharvey

Not market watch worthy, but RG is starting to look really empty

[31-Dec-24 07:46 AM] jcheung#0000
given some advance notice i can gear up to make some


[31-Dec-24 08:26 AM] roche3950#0000
I can also pivot to RG a bit


[31-Dec-24 08:26 AM] roche3950#0000
would need a couple days


[31-Dec-24 08:32 AM] jcheung#0000
given a three day notice i'm willing to make 34/d (or earlier if PG is delivered to deimos) [note to self: 7:4]


[31-Dec-24 08:36 AM] jcheung#0000
if demand is high enough, then i can step it up to 44/d [note to self: 19:10]


[31-Dec-24 08:54 AM] roche3950#0000
At full tilt it looks like I can make 72 per day


[31-Dec-24 08:55 AM] roche3950#0000
if PG is a factor @jcheung I have a little bit in flight to ANT as we speak (I'm meaning to sell it anyway)


[31-Dec-24 08:55 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm siphoning off some GL time for some other stuff üòì


[31-Dec-24 08:55 AM] roche3950#0000
imagine not, but I'd rather have asked than not :)


[31-Dec-24 10:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If anyone's going to pivot to RG... I'd suggest to get into negotiations with anyone who's needing a constant supply of RG, or GL, among other things.

It's one thing to "claim" that a market is running out, with a weak advert on anything in hopes of "boosting" productivity.... It's another thing to offer tangible sales turnovers, to anyone who might think of spinning up a base for the stuff. 

Don't let your fellow Antareans dry out on the surplus markets. Negotiate with each other, and purchase what others are making, or could make.


[31-Dec-24 10:16 AM] tanda#0000
Cmon Roh. It's me we're talking about here


[31-Dec-24 10:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
;P

It's not about you, it's about the commodity market. RG is very niche, being used for LC/WS (SCI consumables), shipbuilding, or POPI upkeep/upgrades... and nothing else. 

If you know your weekly metrics, then you can pitch an advertisement in-house. Anyone with a spare permit should be keen, as a Metallurgy COGC, GF base (for GL/RG+), is an easy revenue/upkeep stream. However they just need the sales turnover, which they're unlikely to get at the CX.


[31-Dec-24 10:39 AM] roche3950#0000
uh ... prefabs too?


[31-Dec-24 10:40 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Let see, a 12 GF base at a Metallurgy COGC, at a price point of 900 AIC per unit of RG (700 RG weekly per that design), gets you that much.

[31-Dec-24 10:40 AM] jcheung#0000
if you had read what we said, "given advanced notice we can pivot", we are not moving *now* to it


[31-Dec-24 10:41 AM] jcheung#0000
in fact all i'll be doing in prep is moving a small amount of PG to deimos when i next remember to do so, and thinking about buying SEN


[31-Dec-24 10:42 AM] jcheung#0000
if you would like it more clearly stated for you


[31-Dec-24 10:42 AM] jcheung#0000
i won't swap until someone reaches out to me and goes "hey, i need RG"


[31-Dec-24 10:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Through all this time time, you should know that I only hand out potential ideas.

If you stand for more players, other than just yourself, maybe you could state "we" thoroughly; else I'm of the opinion that everyone's a separate entity, and will do whatever they want in-game.


[31-Dec-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But im with you on the swap thing. No need to pivot unless someone gives deets, and requirements.


[31-Dec-24 10:47 AM] jcheung#0000
it's hard to see it now that it's been pushed offscreen, but if you scroll up, there were two of us that stated we could be on call for RG production. so yes, i speak for more than myself.
if someone sees this discussion about a niche market shortage and decides to drop a base for it, that is their prerogative as well


[31-Dec-24 10:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, I'm not scrolling up, lol. I will scroll down though. Discord's a relay chat app... Not a bulletin board forum.

@jvaler did you receive your secret santa gift ?


[31-Dec-24 11:35 AM] jvaler#0000
i don't think it's that deep... it's just FLX, it doesn't make-or-break a SME base


[31-Dec-24 11:36 AM] jvaler#0000
haven't logged in in like 36hrs idk


[31-Dec-24 12:09 PM] jvaler#0000
please don't post walls of text explaining econ 101... it's unnecessary and just floods chat with messages that aren't really useful


[31-Dec-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
"if you want more production, communicate and cooperate" - obviously, which is what people were already doing before the walls of text disrupted it


[31-Dec-24 12:30 PM] tanda#0000
Well this is the second time they've done this general thing. First time was with Carbon. 
Yeah this time it was just FLX, but these events seem clearly intended to disrupt.


[31-Dec-24 12:58 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i suppose so. FLX is just a bad pick for a target


[31-Dec-24 01:02 PM] .shiva.#0000

do you know how to use PrunPlanner @freeloader4 ?


[04-Jan-25 08:08 AM] freeloader4#0000
i saw it but didnt want to watch a guide how to use it so i just started using a spreadsheet


[04-Jan-25 08:08 AM] jcheung#0000
it's worth taking some time to poke around in it


[04-Jan-25 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
well, you can use a spreadsheet, it's a perfectly valid choice


[04-Jan-25 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend to learn how to use prunplanner  still


[04-Jan-25 08:09 AM] jcheung#0000
it's arguably faster than a sheet when you get used to it (is pretty quick), but sheet is more customizable depending on your skills


[04-Jan-25 08:09 AM] freeloader4#0000
alright that was enough to convince me then, ill watch a video later


[04-Jan-25 08:09 AM] laaxus#0000
because it'd allow you to verify the numbers of your spreadsheet


[04-Jan-25 08:09 AM] laaxus#0000

I've just starting using RPrun, and I notice on CONTC it says (auto) for my loan contracts. Do installments just pay out automatically if I let them hit the deadline? I've been making payments a little early to make sure I don't miss them.

just trying to figure out what a good price is now that DW is so expensive


[04-Jan-25 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
though 800 isn't too bad. Ideally, I feel like COF should have a lower ROI than DW, but that's just kinda tough to achieve with the price of DW right now

at 850/u, you get this roi


[04-Jan-25 12:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
so 850 is about on par with DW at current prices (ROI wise)


[04-Jan-25 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
which isn't bad - I guess it's less a case of COF not being profitable enough and more that DW is too profitable


[04-Jan-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000

Running packages from a base to a nearby CX is quite a common task, for example


[04-Jan-25 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
The ones to deliver items can sometimes use items you already have on the planet, and can pay a bit better than CX ask price-sometimes

If you disable the top bar buttons in rprun they use the default alphanumeric sort order so you can just put numbers at the beginning of their names.

I don't know if they keep that order if you turn it back on but they might

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05-Jan-25 03:52 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I am told they also use the same order as the top bar so if you hade enough of them so both the ones you want are on the top bar you can reorder them there and then unhide


[05-Jan-25 03:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
The setting to disable it is screen-tab-bar (in XIT SET FEAT) 

Reenabling it, however, restores the bad sort.

(This sorting issue was about the only feature of rprun that I needed to get rid of immediately, so I'm glad I didn't use it long enough to want the top buttons)

why do you want to use numbers tho? You can just rearange the top bar as you wish with rprun


[05-Jan-25 04:20 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
bercause I have like 5x as many screens as fit on the top bar even on doublewide monitor.


[05-Jan-25 04:20 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
so rearranging them needs the hide-tab trick which is just annoying


[05-Jan-25 04:21 AM] realharvey#0000
how many screens do you have?


[05-Jan-25 04:21 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
right now about 20 but I expect that to grow


[05-Jan-25 04:21 AM] realharvey#0000
I have 12 with 25 Bases


[05-Jan-25 04:22 AM] laaxus#0000
One screen per base gang


[05-Jan-25 04:22 AM] realharvey#0000
I had that before. Until I realised I dont really use most of the base information


[05-Jan-25 04:23 AM] realharvey#0000
I narrowed it down to: Prod Window + Storage and a Burn window


[05-Jan-25 04:23 AM] realharvey#0000
but you can combine multiple bases per burn window


[05-Jan-25 04:23 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I also didn't feel it was a huge advantage to have the top bar at all, and since I wasn't used to it, it was easier to just disable it and get the sorting I wanted


[05-Jan-25 04:24 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
maybe I'll want a different setup when I have more than 2 bases and 1 cx


[05-Jan-25 04:24 AM] realharvey#0000
I love the top bar. But everyone has their own approaches


[05-Jan-25 04:25 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, pretty much.,

Anyway, if sorting the menu is important, you can disable the top bar feature and get it.


[05-Jan-25 04:25 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
and failing that, you can hide tabs and reorder them with the extra effort.


[05-Jan-25 04:26 AM] realharvey#0000
first time I hear about this issue. Guess most people dont have that many screens


[05-Jan-25 04:27 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
When I asked about it on the rprun channel on the community tools discord, they also suggested using very short names, like "A" "B" "C" etc to max the number of tabs that are visible.


[05-Jan-25 05:46 AM] tanda#0000
20 screens for 2 bases?üò±


[05-Jan-25 07:34 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I mean, some of it was saving the default screens since I was new (maybe 3-4), but also stuff like several screens for trading supplies and inputs which I thought might be useful at first.

I dunno, I'll figure out which aren't useful eventually I guess.

10 screens per base is a little much


[05-Jan-25 10:08 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
With the backups and the ones that don't scale with number of bases... when I get a third base, it will probably only be 7 screens each, then 5, etc...

[05-Jan-25 10:30 AM] jcheung#0000
open `xit note` , create new, record the buffer command


[05-Jan-25 10:30 AM] jcheung#0000
then you can recreate it later if you're really curious


[05-Jan-25 10:33 AM] jcheung#0000
if it's something you don't look at regularly, it has no business just adding clutter and making your experience that much worse


[05-Jan-25 10:33 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I appreciate your thoughts, but my experience is quite plesant

[05-Jan-25 10:34 AM] jcheung#0000
was just a suggestion after all


[05-Jan-25 10:34 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Also, its not individual buffers, its screens (layouts, etc).


[05-Jan-25 10:35 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
and I currently have all of the "backups" sorted to the bottom anyway


[05-Jan-25 10:35 AM] jcheung#0000
why do you need to preserve layout?


[05-Jan-25 10:36 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
It doesn't cost anything and I'm still new so I might find use later?


[05-Jan-25 10:36 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Some screens are the vanilla verson of screens I've updated to use rprun buffers, like the default finance and contracts views.  That way I can remove rprun should the mod break something and get them back instantly.

what'd be a nice QOL is if the trade charts I have on saved screens would remember and correctly pull data for the ranges I'd set for them the last time I looked at them


[05-Jan-25 10:55 AM] kynadre#0000
whenever I reload the game they end up just a tiny sliver at the end of the chart and I gotta go clicky-clicky to unset and re-set get it to work again


[05-Jan-25 11:16 AM] tanda#0000
Been a while since I posted my screens, so here they are. There's some I'm not showing here but they are for very specific purposes or about to be deprecated. (Travel is now just a giant MU buffer)

I've put 100 up on the CX for the moment. I'm trying to meet a goal of building and stocking all the parts needed to build 1 full gateway. The TSH requirements for that = 1200.

Including the 100 I just threw up on the cx I've got 942 TSH at ANT. I'll keep producing till I reach that goal and then play it by ear.

I don't think there is much reason to produce it. It's heavy and it costs almost nothing


[09-Jan-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
That was part of my thought. If i can bring the asks up a few points it becomes reasonable for a new player

We are currently experiencing fewer playernumbers. I don't think we should encourage them to go for products where the mm is totally fine

Out of curiosity, is there a power ranking or generally agreed upon list of the largest/most influential corps and player organizations anywhere? Are there any planets that are held exclusively or in their majority by single corporations or players?


[11-Jan-25 11:08 AM] tanda#0000
I would say that power ranking the corps is probably pointless. It's too abstract/hard to pull together that information.


[11-Jan-25 11:08 AM] tanda#0000
Largest Corporations is easy, though. Biggest ones by member count are GTU, KAWA, and LMAO


[11-Jan-25 11:10 AM] tanda#0000
It would be equally hard to say about Corp only planets, but if you see a planet with only one plot gone, that's held by a single player

is it just player churn?


[11-Jan-25 11:21 AM] tanda#0000

funnily enough, #1 increased their production within the last week


[11-Jan-25 12:49 PM] jcheung#0000
ah. oh. i was #1 on 90 day


[11-Jan-25 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
looks like melon dropped out entirely, and faster than freight picked up the pace (i dialed back a little)


[11-Jan-25 12:50 PM] moke.#0000
Also, there's a single class (technicians) that require SC, and its .1/100 techs


[11-Jan-25 12:50 PM] moke.#0000
I don't think its really going to be a "big" consumable


[11-Jan-25 12:51 PM] jcheung#0000
right, i'm just shocked i was top 3


[11-Jan-25 12:51 PM] moke.#0000
I found out I was top 5 for a few things the other day that surprised me


[11-Jan-25 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
there's only one thing i expect to see myself for in top 5...


[11-Jan-25 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
_looks_


[11-Jan-25 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
yep, there i am


[11-Jan-25 12:56 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh jeez, I'm #1 ALO for 30 days......... thats very surprising !


[11-Jan-25 01:00 PM] igfloz#0000
.......and I make very little AL


[11-Jan-25 01:00 PM] tanda#0000
Both. At the same time. But in all honesty, the more expensive it gets the more likely people will produce it


[11-Jan-25 01:01 PM] igfloz#0000
But consumption won't increase to match. As Moke says, it's only Techs that use it


[11-Jan-25 01:05 PM] tanda#0000
I just want production increased enough that we aren't stuck in this weird state of constantly nearly running out


[11-Jan-25 01:05 PM] jcheung#0000
well, this is part of the reason i started making it and listed it in #internal-offers


[11-Jan-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
because i saw nobody else was making it and the markets even like 7 months ago was thin


[11-Jan-25 01:06 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh, I think I see where you are coming from. yeah, I suppose if someone is buying 2 months of burn and leaving 10 items for everyone else, that person could be "creating" a problem ?

[11-Jan-25 01:07 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm still only buying for 10 day burns


[11-Jan-25 01:09 PM] igfloz#0000
maybe I should have said "if multiple people are buying 2 months stock"


[11-Jan-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
I decided to buy 100 days of workforce consummables


[11-Jan-25 01:10 PM] jcheung#0000
realistically though


[11-Jan-25 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
someone buying 2 months at a time should be fine..... as long as you don't have half the player base buying at the same schedule


[11-Jan-25 01:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean we kinda are? we just don't have an ingame ADI "corp"


[11-Jan-25 01:13 PM] jvaler#0000
we host a number of projects that could be considered "corp activity"


[11-Jan-25 01:46 PM] evov#0000
The industrial hub I've built up has (at the moment) 9 planets in it. Systems IA-151 and IA-158.
158e supports scientists, the rest can support up to engineers (at the moment)

It's within 1 day's flight from both ANT cx and HRT cx and will at some point in the future have a gateway linking it to the ANT cx and possibly to HRT further down the line.

I'm looking for new people to join the project all the time, so if anyone is interested in helping to build and grow this industrial hub, let me know.

in other news TRU prices have recently climbed for some totally unknown reason


[11-Jan-25 04:40 PM] moke.#0000
I mean, I produce too. Too many low volume orders undercutting too much at once.

Cost me less than a million to get it from 400-750. Half of what I have posted on mine that I've produced myself.

TRU is a readily made material, people will boost production to take advantage

[11-Jan-25 04:55 PM] igfloz#0000
lol, fair enuf I suppose


[12-Jan-25 04:28 AM] finestone#0000
how does increasing TRU price by 300 hurt new players?


[12-Jan-25 12:19 PM] igfloz#0000
I've slept since then, but I was probably thinking along the lines of uplifting the price of anything could impact newer players, not just TRU specifically üôÇ


[12-Jan-25 12:20 PM] finestone#0000
but doesnt that just create more opportunities for new players to make money?


[12-Jan-25 12:21 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, I suppose. I was probably just thinking of base build / burn mats impacting newer players - i.e. making it more expensive for them to get up and running


[12-Jan-25 12:22 PM] igfloz#0000
...but in reality, I suppose this really only starts to hurt when it comes to base 2 or 3


[12-Jan-25 12:57 PM] jcheung#0000
The RAT prices probably hurt more than anything


[12-Jan-25 12:57 PM] igfloz#0000
heh, and COF right now, lol

we've been dealing with these DW prices for 3 months now


[12-Jan-25 01:01 PM] igfloz#0000
I think it was Tanda that mentioned previously (or maybe in another channel) - the price is one thing, but the fact that there is not a lot up for offer is a real concern


[12-Jan-25 01:01 PM] igfloz#0000

actually looking at the charts, it seems like its been that way for a while. why process aluminum ore then?

tbf this game has been backburnered for a few months now, so i've just been steadily increasing my equity by just running my loops

[12-Jan-25 06:59 PM] tanda#0000

[12-Jan-25 07:00 PM] tanda#0000
Better than burning yourself out and stopping playing


[12-Jan-25 07:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
yeah see i did that... took like a month to recover


[12-Jan-25 07:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
had to ship consumables, repair buildings, restart prod lines, was fun /s


[12-Jan-25 07:00 PM] tanda#0000
I bet. I dislike repairing bases intensely

‚òùÔ∏è 

[12-Jan-25 07:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
so now i ensure i have roughly 30 days of consumables. its expensive, and thats where most of my equity lies lol, but if i go awol for a few weeks again,  not the end of the world


[12-Jan-25 07:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
sure ill lose a ton of money because i won't have the space to continue producing


[12-Jan-25 07:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
and ill just burn through my consumables


[12-Jan-25 07:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
but restarting it is as easy as doing one loop


[12-Jan-25 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
I've somehow mostly transitioned to having bases with 20+ days of storage


[12-Jan-25 07:02 PM] tanda#0000

but i could have and see an important 8 or so


[12-Jan-25 07:03 PM] jvaler#0000
same
i wish more stuff in the game acted like consumables and recurring orders, where it's just automatically subtracted from your inventory as long as you have a stockpile. having to manually intervene instead of just drop off items is annoying.
at least CoGC/POPI upkeep doesn't have the same kind of time-sensitive window of efficiency that repairing has

once that comes out, man ill be able to actually go AWOL and not worry about anything


[12-Jan-25 07:05 PM] antisyntax#0000
as long as my ANT warehouse has a month or so of consumables, i can just let it go on autopilot


[12-Jan-25 07:05 PM] antisyntax#0000
i also can't wait for player CX's / player stations


[12-Jan-25 07:06 PM] antisyntax#0000
especially if there is a docking whitelist


[12-Jan-25 07:06 PM] antisyntax#0000
because then we could just do the internal offers on the ADI space station w/o needing to deal with contracts


[12-Jan-25 09:10 PM] jcheung#0000
I thought it was like 4:6


[12-Jan-25 09:10 PM] jcheung#0000
Going off memory tho


[12-Jan-25 09:11 PM] antisyntax#0000
i was going off carbon to aluminum, but i was doing C:ALO not C:AL, so i guess its more 1:4


[12-Jan-25 09:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh


[13-Jan-25 12:14 PM] freeloader4#0000
is there a way to remove a permit from a base, I have 2 and would only like it to have 1

yes


[13-Jan-25 12:15 PM] laaxus#0000
you lower your area used to under 500


[13-Jan-25 12:15 PM] laaxus#0000

Im split between farming, and water. Dunno whats better/more fun/profitable/easier


[16-Jan-25 09:16 AM] jvaler#0000
we also have deimos if you wanna smelt AL, antares is renowned for our strong AL industry

[16-Jan-25 09:17 AM] jvaler#0000
water as in DW or H2O?

No idea, people say both are in short supply, and both are good, but not to do both?

cause for H2O in antares that's best done on ice station alpha, but that planet's quite expensive to build on

something you could do is actually start on norwick, the food industries CoGC planet, as opposed to phobos

[16-Jan-25 09:19 AM] jvaler#0000
you'd just pack your starter things into a ship, fly over there, and plop your base down

but you know how when you first start you have a limited selection of starter planets? you're not actually technically limited to those


[16-Jan-25 09:21 AM] jvaler#0000
you can just take your things to another planet and start there instead

he can't, he is a free player


[16-Jan-25 09:23 AM] jvaler#0000
nearest to the CX is technically phobos, but it sucks cause it's electronics CoGC.

however, hephaestus is even closer to the CX, and i consider it an honorary starter. you just need to know about it first to start there. it has a manufacturing CoGC, which can be lucrative if you pick the right recipes to make in your BMPs


[16-Jan-25 09:23 AM] laaxus#0000
it's still very profitable


[16-Jan-25 09:23 AM] laaxus#0000
even if it's electronics cogc


[16-Jan-25 09:24 AM] jvaler#0000
that's only because DW FP are profitable

[16-Jan-25 09:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
What profession do i start with?


[16-Jan-25 09:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Victualler?


[16-Jan-25 09:29 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah that's the one


[16-Jan-25 09:29 AM] jvaler#0000
i think you'll get building mats for a FRM as well as the FP, but you can always just sell those mats


[16-Jan-25 09:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
I need the fp no?


[16-Jan-25 09:30 AM] jvaler#0000
for the DW plan, yes


[16-Jan-25 09:30 AM] jvaler#0000
i meant selling the FRM mats


[16-Jan-25 09:30 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, how can I see what's the MM bands ?
Can't we give the grant through market manipulation ?


[16-Jan-25 09:30 AM] laaxus#0000
like, he buy something for cheap, and then sell it back to use for much more


[16-Jan-25 09:30 AM] laaxus#0000
and he gain the difference


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
Hahaha


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] jvaler#0000
doesn't the FIO prices endpoint have MM data?


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] laaxus#0000
idk


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm supposed to work right now


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] laaxus#0000

[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
Wouldnt it also just sell to the person who has oldest bid?


[16-Jan-25 09:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
I can check


[16-Jan-25 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
hence why we must find a product with close to no bid and ask


[16-Jan-25 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
like jui


[16-Jan-25 09:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh fair enough


[16-Jan-25 09:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Where tf you gonna get 1mil AIC worth of something no one wants or has


[16-Jan-25 09:33 AM] jvaler#0000
there's a number of dead-end commodities that haven't had uses implemented yet


[16-Jan-25 09:33 AM] jvaler#0000
MTC for example


[16-Jan-25 09:35 AM] jvaler#0000
that or intermediates that have only a single use, so most people who consume them just produce it themselves, like IND


[16-Jan-25 09:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ah ok


[16-Jan-25 09:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ok, im in the game

[16-Jan-25 09:37 AM] pagy1234#0000

[16-Jan-25 09:37 AM] jvaler#0000
you can


[16-Jan-25 09:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mved both since both have tons of stuff onboard


[16-Jan-25 09:38 AM] jvaler#0000
if it's empty, you should send it to the CX to go ahead and buy your H2O


[16-Jan-25 09:38 AM] jvaler#0000
so you can start producing sooner


[16-Jan-25 09:38 AM] jvaler#0000
oh it has stuff too?


[16-Jan-25 09:38 AM] jvaler#0000
nvm then


[16-Jan-25 09:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh yeah and its weirdlt split


[16-Jan-25 09:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
All construction in one


[16-Jan-25 09:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
And all nessessities in other


[16-Jan-25 09:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
But i do start with 32 water


[16-Jan-25 09:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
So that should be alr


[16-Jan-25 09:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
Wait the CX is farrrr


[16-Jan-25 09:43 AM] jvaler#0000
iirc CX <-> norwick is 16hrs lolol


[16-Jan-25 09:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
@jvaler should i just send a ships to cx anyways and load up a bunch of water before i start producing?


[16-Jan-25 09:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
Meh, thats alr


[16-Jan-25 09:43 AM] jvaler#0000
probably... 32 isn't gonna last you long


[16-Jan-25 09:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah i can either send a ship to cx as soon as im set up, or do it now and delay setup


[16-Jan-25 09:44 AM] jvaler#0000
you also need to buy luxury consumables while you're there


[16-Jan-25 09:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
Nah il send my nessessities ship now, might aswell grab extra stuff


[16-Jan-25 09:45 AM] pagy1234#0000

Oh yeah, fair point


[16-Jan-25 09:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ig i can always resell it lol


[16-Jan-25 09:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
I will need some construction material right?


[16-Jan-25 10:00 AM] .urpalhal#0000
To make the base? Yep


[16-Jan-25 10:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
What exactly will i need?


[16-Jan-25 10:00 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh uh


[16-Jan-25 10:08 AM] jcheung#0000
you still need some to start off


[16-Jan-25 10:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would put some numbers into prunplanner and it can tell you exact numbers on construction stuffs


[16-Jan-25 10:08 AM] pagy1234#0000
PP is telling me i need 125x H2O a day PER Fs


[16-Jan-25 10:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok


[16-Jan-25 10:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Do you see the button on the left side that says construction? That‚Äôs where you can see how much of each building mat you need


[16-Jan-25 10:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
I havent got a base yet


[16-Jan-25 10:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
Still moving to norwik


[16-Jan-25 10:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
if you haven't got a base yet


[16-Jan-25 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
you also need the CM


[16-Jan-25 10:13 AM] jcheung#0000
and also housing

After


[16-Jan-25 10:23 AM] jcheung#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
Most trades already went through


[16-Jan-25 10:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
Maybe just starting off with 2x hb1 and 1x FS


[16-Jan-25 10:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh yeah I would‚Äôve done this‚Ä¶


[16-Jan-25 10:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean sure


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, the issue is that he spent all his capital on goods


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
so now that market manipulation idea is not possible anymore


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
it is


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
if the goods are at CX


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ah shoot.


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
we can just liquidate it


[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm pretty sure free player can't buy goods outside of the MM range ?

[16-Jan-25 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
when you don't have cash, you kinda have to


[16-Jan-25 10:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Or


[16-Jan-25 10:25 AM] jcheung#0000
you do quantity, within the ask and bid bands


[16-Jan-25 10:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I have a code for temporary free pro


[16-Jan-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000

U sure?


[16-Jan-25 10:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
Dont wanna be wasting your codes

[16-Jan-25 10:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mean, if you are really sure about it then its fine with me too


[16-Jan-25 10:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Who else is gonna use them? I can‚Äôt use them on myself

[16-Jan-25 10:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Wym?


[16-Jan-25 10:34 AM] .urpalhal#0000
The free pro codes give pro but then you go back to free not basic after


[16-Jan-25 10:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
Alr, i got PRO


[16-Jan-25 10:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
How do i get the grant now?


[16-Jan-25 10:37 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Make plan in Prunplanner then the sharks judge and provide feedback and give out cash


[16-Jan-25 10:37 AM] laaxus#0000
#agp-information


[16-Jan-25 10:37 AM] jcheung#0000
i meant if like someone gets pro and then loses it


[16-Jan-25 10:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ah cool, il check it out


[16-Jan-25 10:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[16-Jan-25 10:38 AM] jcheung#0000
goes pro not from gift code


[16-Jan-25 10:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes I know it‚Äôs temporary


[16-Jan-25 10:39 AM] jcheung#0000
if *i* were to try to use it when pro expires


[16-Jan-25 10:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean I think you would go to basic


[16-Jan-25 10:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Not free


[16-Jan-25 10:39 AM] jcheung#0000
go on


[16-Jan-25 10:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc *you* bought pro before


[16-Jan-25 10:40 AM] jcheung#0000
go on


[16-Jan-25 10:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000
That‚Äôs all I got


[16-Jan-25 10:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I think only free players can activate pro code ?

[16-Jan-25 10:41 AM] .urpalhal#0000

thats unfortunate


[16-Jan-25 09:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm like 75% sure. Maybe I'm thinking about the... no basic players can use a code rule..?


[16-Jan-25 09:35 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm 99.9% sure...
if you've already used a key for 1 month of PRO you can't use another key, people have tried


[16-Jan-25 11:41 PM] pagy1234#0000
damn ok


[17-Jan-25 04:14 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
are there ship repair calculators to help figure out "when to repair a ship" similar to the base repair calculators in refined prun and prunplanner?


[17-Jan-25 04:15 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
like, when will the next big items tick over.


[17-Jan-25 04:16 AM] .shiva.#0000
Doesnt really matter as much, 80% is when they start significantly slowing down though


[17-Jan-25 04:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
do most people just do 79-81% or so then?


[17-Jan-25 04:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
mostly I'm trying to figure out the cost to plan for more than "optimal time" I guess.  I can see the current cost, but not the cost in another 10% of repair need (or 9.5% if that saves a significant amount)


[17-Jan-25 04:19 AM] .shiva.#0000
Its not going to be a ton more. Extra hull plate or two


[17-Jan-25 04:21 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
ok thanks


[17-Jan-25 04:22 AM] .shiva.#0000
Theres a fixed cost + something that scales with the dmg%


[17-Jan-25 04:22 AM] .shiva.#0000
So as long as you don't constantly top it up, its kinda w/e


[17-Jan-25 04:23 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
yeah, given that I'm still pretty poor, I'd love to know where the next hull plate or SSC tacks on.  that 3k is small but still noticable to me üôÇ


[17-Jan-25 04:23 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
but the total isn't much compaired to base repair, its true


[17-Jan-25 04:24 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
As long as I'm not going to need to come up with, like, an ENG (its just hull plates and SSC etc), then I can worry less though.


[17-Jan-25 04:43 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, there are 2 schools :
- Repair at 80%, that's when it starts to be annoying and it doesn't cost much
- Never repair, it doesn't slow it down that much anyway


[17-Jan-25 04:43 AM] laaxus#0000

[18-Jan-25 08:02 AM] laaxus#0000
Idk


[18-Jan-25 08:03 AM] igfloz#0000
I'm bringing back small amounts of LIO and HAL from a faraway place - not enough to feed a full SME base, but possibly it could help for you to keep injecting LI production in between other SME ingredients ?


[18-Jan-25 08:04 AM] laaxus#0000
HAL isn't an issue, I have my own HAL production

[20-Jan-25 12:38 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[20-Jan-25 12:39 AM] jvaler#0000
efficiency = speed in prun, not yield

my math has some flaws then


[20-Jan-25 04:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
Actually, just because im curious, is 141% good? Or are there some simple ways to bump this up?


[20-Jan-25 04:39 AM] laaxus#0000
most aim to 160.5

you most probably have both luxuries + 3 experts

Yeah spot on


[20-Jan-25 04:41 AM] laaxus#0000
100% is basic consummables + 0 expert

How much of a given market do you guys think would need to be produced to move the needle down on it?


[21-Jan-25 05:19 PM] tanda#0000
is 20% additional production of a given market's volume enough to lead to a gradual price drop?


[21-Jan-25 05:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd think so -  it kinda depends on what you‚Äôre making


[21-Jan-25 05:26 PM] jcheung#0000
120% rat? Probably not.
120% hse? Probably.

[21-Jan-25 05:27 PM] tanda#0000

[21-Jan-25 05:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Meanwhile i was thinking about trying to see how complicated hiting a bunch of newbies to make RAT materials would be (basically rise, but much much weaker)


[21-Jan-25 05:30 PM] tanda#0000
Honestly I think if you use Thalassa, a single 2k/2k could service the supply chain for up to 3 FP bases


[21-Jan-25 05:30 PM] jcheung#0000
Also what time frame you looking at? Just 1 week?


[21-Jan-25 05:30 PM] tanda#0000
since October. Prun planner's market exploration puts at a supply/demand deficit delta of 450k over the last 90 days


[21-Jan-25 05:31 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh, nice. Has there been overall growth in consumption or has that been steady


[21-Jan-25 05:32 PM] tanda#0000
seems pretty steady. Looks a bit like we lost a couple smaller suppliers with the Holidays and have yet to pick up replacements

MOR is fine somehow, HRT is 250k in deficit, and BEN is 220k in deficit


[21-Jan-25 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
so ANT is the sore spot it seems


[21-Jan-25 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
HRT is likely in deficit due to MOR's demand


[21-Jan-25 05:43 PM] tanda#0000
if we sum everything together and then slap an additional 20% on top, we're looking at a production target of 12k per day


[21-Jan-25 05:53 PM] jcheung#0000
How many bases is that


[21-Jan-25 05:54 PM] tanda#0000

[21-Jan-25 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
That's a lot of support bases


[21-Jan-25 06:01 PM] tanda#0000
for 12k production: 7 FP, 5 HYF, 3 H2O, 2 hybrid NS production bases


[21-Jan-25 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Tbh i wonder if this should be done in west antares


[21-Jan-25 06:01 PM] tanda#0000
for 7.2k production for local market: 5 FP, 4 HYF, 3 H2O, 1 NS


[21-Jan-25 06:02 PM] jcheung#0000
Is hyf the best option available?


[21-Jan-25 06:02 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it takes about 20 FRM bases to hit the production numbers needed


[21-Jan-25 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Fk


[21-Jan-25 06:03 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, FRMs are just not up to it.


[21-Jan-25 06:04 PM] tanda#0000
There might be a way to hybrid production that is more efficient than pure HYF, but Harmonia is also 4 jumps away, and these bases will eat a shipload of imports in about 2 days


[21-Jan-25 06:05 PM] jcheung#0000
I'll take a gander and see if i have anything to add. What recipe?


[21-Jan-25 06:05 PM] tanda#0000
recipes used for this comparison was BEA/GRN/NUT for FRM and ALG/MAI/VEG for HYF

[21-Jan-25 07:47 PM] tanda#0000
aww, but we were arguing/debating


[21-Jan-25 07:52 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, but i was arguing about google sheets with someone


[22-Jan-25 07:03 AM] laaxus#0000
can we steal promitor


[22-Jan-25 07:03 AM] laaxus#0000
and bring it back to zv-307


[22-Jan-25 07:03 AM] tanda#0000
Lol no. We got agri hard mode here


[22-Jan-25 07:04 AM] laaxus#0000
imagine all the new member of the adi we would get


[22-Jan-25 07:04 AM] tanda#0000
Though like jcheung was saying, it might be worth looking at doing something like this in BEN or HRT


[22-Jan-25 07:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
we can take planets?


[22-Jan-25 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
unfortunately not


[22-Jan-25 07:27 AM] realharvey#0000
We should be able to move planets. Slap 102939388 Ships with a tow onto the planet and pull it over to antares


[22-Jan-25 07:53 AM] flor2081#0000
just have to wait until they add terraforming


[22-Jan-25 07:53 AM] flor2081#0000
maybe that'll even happen within this decade ü§î


[22-Jan-25 11:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
No ships needed, just a few big thrusters‚Ä¶


[22-Jan-25 11:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Remembers me at Planetary Annihilation, the game xD


[23-Jan-25 08:06 AM] brelov#0000
No need for thrusters just sling a small black hole past the system and it'll drag everything along in a new orbit

with rising costs of H2O and falling DW price, what are some things I should do to save money?


[23-Jan-25 08:45 PM] tanda#0000
DW isn't dropping much if at all, and H2O has been stuck at Zipatsu's 1mil sell order for a minute, lol. You have time. Best option is to start planning out your next base

All my consumables have been full for a bit, just the occasional top up


[24-Jan-25 12:00 AM] jvaler#0000
i mean like going from 1-3 days worth of stock in the base to 7-10 days worth


[24-Jan-25 12:00 AM] jvaler#0000
but maybe you haven't done that so idk

I have 16 Ships. Not sure how many it where around that time

Mostly Aluminium Alliance Cooperations. Also another 2 Base Cooperation with Xflqr.

[24-Jan-25 01:46 AM] jvaler#0000
looks like it was mostly inventory


[24-Jan-25 01:46 AM] jvaler#0000
might have been CAAP payout, it was delayed for a while so it built up a bit


[24-Jan-25 01:46 AM] realharvey#0000
I had the same tho


[24-Jan-25 01:47 AM] jvaler#0000
maybe cause you've got 2 shares i have 4? idk...


[24-Jan-25 01:48 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah that might be it. I have 4 permits next permit aswell, so I can catch up with you in terms of afabs :D


[24-Jan-25 01:48 AM] jvaler#0000
you've got 4 free permits?? o.O


[24-Jan-25 01:48 AM] realharvey#0000
nooo

that's right there was reorganizing lately

I had 1 free permit and added one of my chembases


[24-Jan-25 01:55 AM] realharvey#0000
it's good that we still keep steadily growing. We can comfortable still give grants and help players by buying their stock to give them liquidity

[24-Jan-25 01:58 AM] jvaler#0000
maybe i should


[24-Jan-25 01:58 AM] realharvey#0000
I only do if someone is looking for a buyer or has too much stock


[24-Jan-25 01:59 AM] realharvey#0000
and if its too good of a deal I overpay

or too much to manage?


[24-Jan-25 02:02 AM] jvaler#0000
kinda the latter


[24-Jan-25 02:02 AM] jvaler#0000
i run some bases i don't really care about


[24-Jan-25 02:02 AM] jvaler#0000
so i'm gonna try and shut them down


[24-Jan-25 02:03 AM] jvaler#0000
but they're either lent out or part of co-op obligations


[24-Jan-25 02:03 AM] realharvey#0000
I did a lot of restructuring aswell lately. I had 4 smelting bases. Annoying to manage


[24-Jan-25 02:03 AM] jvaler#0000

[24-Jan-25 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
I heavily recommend a FRM base as your second


[24-Jan-25 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
it is the cheapest base possible


[24-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
and have a very good roi


[24-Jan-25 11:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah absolutely, I always try to keep 300k in cash at all times


[24-Jan-25 11:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
lol, yeah thats a big bonus


[24-Jan-25 11:10 AM] realharvey#0000
at your stage you dont need that much cash sitting around


[24-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, I'd say that 100k is enough


[24-Jan-25 11:11 AM] pagy1234#0000
bruh, 100k is my daily spending on H2O


[24-Jan-25 11:11 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah but you sell your production right away


[24-Jan-25 11:11 AM] realharvey#0000
unless you sell to sell orders


[24-Jan-25 11:12 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah idk, i feel way more comfortable knowing I can afford 2-3 days of stuff since it does happen that my ships get delayed


[24-Jan-25 11:12 AM] pagy1234#0000

what do you recomend I should produce?


[24-Jan-25 11:13 AM] realharvey#0000
something RATional maybe


[24-Jan-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
doesnt nessessarily have to be best profit, as long as theres a need for it


[24-Jan-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
lol ok


[24-Jan-25 11:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
make some plants at harmonia and ship to norwick for processing ig would be the plan


[24-Jan-25 11:14 AM] realharvey#0000
yep


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Depends how risky you wanna be üòÑ
Rat is low risk medium reward
HER is medium high risk, high reward


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
@pagy1234 do you still have free space on Norwick for more FPs, or is it all full?


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
still space


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I honestly would recommend starting with her


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
then switch if it stops being that profitable


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you‚Äôre interested, I have a stockpile of materials that I need someone to chew through to make RATs


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mean, i dont mind taking a little risk since i can just cancel production and swap to RAT


[24-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
HER ROI is twice higher than the other recipes, atm


[24-Jan-25 11:16 AM] laaxus#0000
like, HER roi is like, 5 days ?


[24-Jan-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
I assume il be buying them from you?


[24-Jan-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn, thats pretty neat, il do some checking on PUP


[24-Jan-25 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
Either that or I can pay you for processing and setting up some FPs and I can pick up the RATs


[24-Jan-25 11:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôll have to take a look at what all I have, and it wouldn‚Äôt be long term because I just need to get rid of this surplus, but just wanted to throw it out there as an option


[24-Jan-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think il buy them, il make maybe 2 more FP's for it and turn 2 of my currently DW FP's to RAT, then just process the stock slowly


[24-Jan-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
how much are you sitting on rn?


[24-Jan-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly,
Take a loan from jvalier
Buy Sidepipe entire stock
Process the stock and sell the rat
Profit


[24-Jan-25 11:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
Like 4000 veg and 6000 alg, but I‚Äôll have to take stock at all of my bases, and I‚Äôll probably keep some for emergencies üòÑ

You can take a loan from me üòõ


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] laaxus#0000
loans are not the only way


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] laaxus#0000
Sidepipe could jsut delay payment by 30 days


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
that would probably work


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
But seriously, let me take a look at what all I have when I‚Äôm back at my PC and I‚Äôll let you know what‚Äôs available


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
cannot, pro is gone by then


[24-Jan-25 11:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
I do offer credit üòÅ


[24-Jan-25 11:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, thanks


[24-Jan-25 11:22 AM] laaxus#0000
and you should look into the third plant, I know MAI market is rough right now


[24-Jan-25 11:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think MAI or MUS would work


[24-Jan-25 11:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm switching from FRMs to HYF, hence the surplus of weird stuff


[24-Jan-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, I don't know how underage you are, but you should consider buying at least one month of pro to get basic for life
This would allow you to accept contract, even if you can't send them


[24-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
One can pay pro with paysafecards which you can buy in store with cash

(I don't know your situation, I'm just saying that when I was underage, that's how I made my online payments)


[24-Jan-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
its not about not having a card, its that my parents wont let me spend much on videogames


[24-Jan-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
so cash or not they probably wont allow


[24-Jan-25 11:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I see


[24-Jan-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000

MUS doesnt work, unless I missed the recipe


[24-Jan-25 11:40 AM] pagy1234#0000

nvm, completely negligable, 500 aic a day difference


[24-Jan-25 11:43 AM] jvaler#0000
iirc GRN, BEA, VEG is the best FRM-only RAT recipe


[24-Jan-25 11:43 AM] jvaler#0000
cause GRN & BEA grow the fastest


[24-Jan-25 11:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
i think thats right, but I dont have GRN or BEA


[24-Jan-25 11:44 AM] jvaler#0000

Archiel and Exeler are the main producer of HE in Ant space - both from OOG


[27-Jan-25 06:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Most of it goes probably into PSK


[27-Jan-25 06:41 AM] tanda#0000
I think the majority of that probably goes into OOG's own shipbuilding


[27-Jan-25 06:42 AM] tanda#0000
I really do need to secure that supply line for myself, but it's hella shipping intensive


[27-Jan-25 07:04 AM] realharvey#0000
I am considering plotting down a base for that. But it does not look like there is enough demand to support a full permit


[27-Jan-25 07:05 AM] realharvey#0000
Current plan would make 318 HE per day


[27-Jan-25 07:18 AM] tanda#0000
In the next couple months, I'm planning to quadruple my usage


[27-Jan-25 07:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
based on my assumption that HE seems to be a pretty small market, with most of the demand being ship building, wouldnt it be pretty simple to dominate the market, and therefore shipbuilding aswell?


[27-Jan-25 07:23 AM] zipatsu#0000
Yeah, it's going a bit faster than I thought it would. The hope is that the ones that bought large amounts will be good for a while so that I have the chance to catch up ‚úåÔ∏è


[27-Jan-25 07:28 AM] realharvey#0000
if someone tries to dominate a price people will just get their own HE. When prices are to expensive on the CX and "unreasaonable" people just start producing their own


[27-Jan-25 07:29 AM] realharvey#0000
I could easily pay someone the base to plop down and buy all that HE of them on planet


[27-Jan-25 07:30 AM] realharvey#0000
how much demand would that be?


[27-Jan-25 08:07 AM] pagy1234#0000

[27-Jan-25 10:12 PM] evov#0000
HE has been low for about a month now though.


[28-Jan-25 12:20 AM] evov#0000
On a semi related note, I've been on the lookout for my next "project" to work on in the game. One of the idea's that made the shortlist was to start up some MM operations for the ANT CX. Similar to what lowstrife does for/to the MOR CX. 

For the most part in the game, I've been focused on production capacity. Building long logistic chains to solo produce complicated items ( afabs, then ships, now gateway gates ). While I intend for that to remain a core part of what I do in the game, I'm looking to branch out into something new and the MM game seemed like one possibility. 

Before doing it though, I just wanted to throw the idea up here to get thoughts/feedback from people. Do people think it would be a net benefit to the ANT community? Would it "feel bad" to look at the CX and feel like an individual was in control of or manipulating certain markets, or would increased supply / stability /liquidity on the ANT CX feel good and make it easier to do business in the region?

Having large bid to sell into is a nice security to start a base


[28-Jan-25 01:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
When I started, allocator was MMing the C market (that‚Äôs a few months ago)  and I was confused and thought, that‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù, because somebody ‚Äúcontrols‚Äù the market.

As an establish player, I appreciate and acknowledge the benefit MM players have. 

Especially fixing crucial markets, for example DW, RAT, C, etc. gives a feeling of stability.

Or even establishing viable ask/bid orders for markets, which are undersupplied.


[28-Jan-25 02:35 AM] realharvey#0000
I don't consider DW or RAT cruicial markets. They have MM you can buy from. Consumables don't have that big of an impact on profit

i'd say KAWA(castillo-ito corp) is more coordinated than ADI, but not necessarily richer. and their AGP-equivelant (BEST) only gives out 500k as opposed to our 1mil

in terms of being built up, moria would be the contender with antares. i don't know which is more built up, but i'm gonna pretend it's antares.

I just sent one


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
Not sure where to ask this, but here seems most appropriate maybe. I need some advice on when to sell DW, prices are dropping but last time something simmilar happened they rebounded within 2 days, can anyone predict if that will happen again? or if I should sell fast at slightly lower price since they wont rebound?


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] jcheung#0000
it depends on your finances


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have 2.8k DW sitting in CX but idk


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'd say that's entirely up to how quickly you need cash


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] jcheung#0000
if your finances are comfortable, hold at the higher price


[28-Jan-25 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
it's a little of a gamble though


[28-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
hmm, well if thats the way it should go then I probably should sell soon


[28-Jan-25 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
since it could also just crash completely the next day *stares at the NL market when he got started*


[28-Jan-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
lmao, i hope not


[28-Jan-25 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
nah it probably won't crash


[28-Jan-25 11:57 AM] jcheung#0000
i mean, it isn't likely, no


[28-Jan-25 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
demand is high and it trades fast


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
and usually that only happens once you've spent a few million to get into a market üòÖ


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
someone did just throw out an offer for 50k DW @109aic which turbo sucks


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
like BWS üò≠


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] jcheung#0000
*stares at NL again*


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] igfloz#0000
I think we are still shy in daily requirements for DW on the ANT CX, so the price will trend up at some point - all the lower bids will soon sell out


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
i usually trade at 112 but that bloke blocked the market


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
104 it is for today D:


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] igfloz#0000
I feel your pain, been there too brother


[28-Jan-25 11:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
@pagy1234 I'll buy your DW @ 112 if you send me a contract


[28-Jan-25 11:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm short on DW right now anyway so I might as well buy from ADI üòõ


[28-Jan-25 11:59 AM] realharvey#0000

Enough retooling/increase in production capacity has happened in the market finally


[28-Jan-25 12:01 PM] roche3950#0000
So DW price will finally start to crack after ‚Ä¶ what has it been, 30-45d?


[28-Jan-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah tbf it was nearly at MM


[28-Jan-25 12:01 PM] realharvey#0000
people are still plopping down DW bases to this day. So the market will not be as profitable anymore in a few months


[28-Jan-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
but H2O prices wont let this price drop go very far


[28-Jan-25 12:02 PM] igfloz#0000
once the DW price has stabilized at a comfortable number - people will start making COF again..... and then that price will slowly drop


[28-Jan-25 12:03 PM] realharvey#0000
DW price could go down to 80 and stilll be very profitable at current h2o prices


[28-Jan-25 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's why I'm making more COF now üòõ


[28-Jan-25 12:04 PM] realharvey#0000
70 AIC/u is like the lowest where someone could still consider producing it


[28-Jan-25 12:04 PM] realharvey#0000
the current profit margins you can make with DW are not what you should expect from your bases in general


[28-Jan-25 12:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
if DW was at that price I would have made only 67.2k on that 2.8k DW


[28-Jan-25 12:06 PM] realharvey#0000
a full permit of FP DW base makes 148k profit per day


[28-Jan-25 12:06 PM] realharvey#0000
thats insane for a base that is this cheap


[28-Jan-25 12:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
I would have 55k profit at the end of each WEEK with my current expenses if DW goes to 80 :D


[28-Jan-25 12:07 PM] realharvey#0000
how many FP's do you have?


[28-Jan-25 12:11 PM] pagy1234#0000
15


[28-Jan-25 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
by the time DW crashes that far, you should hopefully have enough cash to either make an H2O base or switch those over to RAT / FIM / etc


[28-Jan-25 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
if it ever does, that is üòÑ


[28-Jan-25 12:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, im getting RAT going soon, already starting to move small shipments of your VEG  and ALG to Norwick to start processing as soon as my GRN production start going.


[28-Jan-25 12:32 PM] realharvey#0000
do you use prunplanner? Because that sounds not right


[28-Jan-25 12:32 PM] pagy1234#0000
I have loans to pay outüòî


[28-Jan-25 12:32 PM] pagy1234#0000
Would be 450k a week @80aic


[28-Jan-25 12:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
But loans eat up around 400k currently


[28-Jan-25 12:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
Wait no, somethings fully wrong with my math


[28-Jan-25 12:35 PM] realharvey#0000
going out positive while still repaying a loan is still very good


[28-Jan-25 12:36 PM] pagy1234#0000
So, i know im paying just about 400k in loans a week


[28-Jan-25 12:37 PM] pagy1234#0000
And if i can sell at 112 (high estimate) i make about ~1 mil a week


[28-Jan-25 12:37 PM] pagy1234#0000
If i sell at 80 (worst case) i make about 750


[28-Jan-25 12:37 PM] realharvey#0000
All I wanted to tell you is the following: DW Profit margins are currently crazy high and you should not get to used to it when planning new other bases :)

Yeah, if you expect 120k+ a day, you won't build much else than IDC


[28-Jan-25 12:39 PM] realharvey#0000

[28-Jan-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000

[28-Jan-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000

[28-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
Hal into cl is up there too


[28-Jan-25 12:41 PM] realharvey#0000
and the market will correct that over time. DW crisis happens about once a year and after that it goes to 80-90 aic/u and stays there until it goes up after a few months again


[28-Jan-25 03:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
@tanda are you on Iy-816d?


[28-Jan-25 03:27 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Do we have a group or organisation in Antares space, which dedicates resources to produce metals (especially AL)


[28-Jan-25 03:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
kinda


[28-Jan-25 03:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Aluminum Alliance (AA) has stuff like that


[28-Jan-25 03:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but not for making metals specifically

I'm already feeding AA, plus 2 other customers, I don't think I can take on another ALO customer (if you wanted to spin up your own AL Smelting process)


[28-Jan-25 03:39 PM] igfloz#0000

besides DNPC happening to make AL, i don't know of any metallurgy co-ops in ANT


[28-Jan-25 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000

doing something like DNPC has where there's dedicated EXT and SME bases on deimos would cut down on logi, but is that even that important? ships and upgrade kits are so abundant nowadays it doesn't feel like it

I'll be honest, if any 1 of my current customers fall out of the universe. I'd probably spin up smelting and genuinely join in with something like this. I wonder if most people are vertically integrating AL into their production ?

[28-Jan-25 03:56 PM] igfloz#0000

[29-Jan-25 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
they're just on 3 planets


[29-Jan-25 11:08 PM] evov#0000
I started a couple planets  nearly 2 years ago to test it out and see what it was like. I founded FK-794c and FK-794d as a HYF planet and an FP planet next to Boucher.

I started those planets without an admin center... because at the time that was quite expensive for me. I found it took WAAY too long for pop to fill, especially Settlers.

The 9 I've started recently, all start with Admin Center / CogC / Warehouse (2k space) and Local Market. Pop infrastructure up to whatever you plan on supporting. That combo (assuming pop inf up to Engineers) is about 8mil. +4mil if you want to support scientists. 

While it's time consuming - fractional upkeep on the pop requirements is good way to save $ week to week. 
Immigration programs are life.

Any COF producer on SE-110a?


[30-Jan-25 07:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm thinking about placing a DW base there to reduce internal costs and pump some into the market


[30-Jan-25 07:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000

I‚Äôll buy any DW - just list it on the LM and @ me (unless someone else gets to it first)


[30-Jan-25 07:57 AM] jvaler#0000
i do, but i produce DW there too so it's net positive


[30-Jan-25 08:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
Good to know - I‚Äôll probably drop an ADM out there too. Cost isn‚Äôt really an issue at this point, and I don‚Äôt really feel like waiting months to get 700 PIO üòÑ

one guy bought 8M worth of DDT

pretty sure we're gonna see that DDT on the market again but at a higher price

you can buy HAL at halcyon

Noooo keep buying from me instead ü•≤


[31-Jan-25 06:23 AM] sidepipe#0000

[31-Jan-25 06:24 AM] laaxus#0000
I have 70 days worth of DDT consumptions


[31-Jan-25 06:24 AM] laaxus#0000
I was thinking of selling a bit of ddt to fix the market


[31-Jan-25 06:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ah gotcha - honestly if you use a lot of it, it‚Äôs probably worth dropping your own LAB base someday

[31-Jan-25 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
sell it in low quantity


[31-Jan-25 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000
and increase the price each time


[31-Jan-25 06:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôve just got two bids at 4k and 5k atm - the other CXs are all at 4 as well, so I think we should be okay for now


[31-Jan-25 06:28 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
4k is definately still profitable for HER.


[31-Jan-25 06:28 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
but HER seems like it might catch up


[31-Jan-25 06:28 AM] laaxus#0000
if antares was a country


[31-Jan-25 06:28 AM] laaxus#0000
the central bank would be on fire


[31-Jan-25 06:29 AM] laaxus#0000

playercount is goind down and other people go for more advanced products


[31-Jan-25 06:30 AM] realharvey#0000
this makes tier 1 products less produced and also higher in demand

That‚Äôs not great for my HYFs


[31-Jan-25 06:44 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Sigh, I just built my first HYF too...

And, for my third base, chemistry despite solving these problems seems like a much larger investment for lower profit than just... water extraction.  But maybe my fourth base...


[31-Jan-25 06:47 AM] tanda#0000
Chemistry is inevitable


[31-Jan-25 06:47 AM] tanda#0000
Dread it, Run from it, it still arrives


[31-Jan-25 06:48 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Wait, maybe pruplanner just lied to me because it had out of date prices or something and it isn't as dramatic a difference as I thought (still seems harder to start chemistry though).

Yeah, it probably wasn't obvious I was the highest bid üôÇ


[31-Jan-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
did some planning off from this idea


[31-Jan-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
if I make a CL base on Griffonstone (CL-300c) and extract the HAL directly from the planet, I can have roughly 28k profit per day on a very small scale base with ROI being roughly 18 days


[31-Jan-25 11:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
looks good, but will have to wait a while since I really dont have the cash rn


[31-Jan-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[31-Jan-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
HAL extraction must be at halcyon


[31-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
if don't want to have a second base


[31-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
then buy from the HAL guy


[31-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
which sells its hal pretty cheaply


[31-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
at halcyon


[31-Jan-25 11:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
hmmm


[31-Jan-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
At least, that's what I'd recommend


[31-Jan-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[31-Jan-25 11:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you go that route (which I recommend), make sure to check the import requirements because HAL is heavy

{Reactions}
üëç 

[31-Jan-25 11:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
Though, you could always start with extracting HAL on site and then remove the EXTs to buy your own later


[31-Jan-25 11:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I don‚Äôt remember how good HAL density on griffonstone is so it might not even be worth digging for it


[31-Jan-25 11:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
my daily import to that base would be ~70t/30m


[31-Jan-25 11:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
pretty small lol


[31-Jan-25 11:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
and profit aint bad


[31-Jan-25 11:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
Is that for the base with EXT and CHP or just pure CHP?


[31-Jan-25 11:30 AM] laaxus#0000
what would be the profit for 500 area ?


[31-Jan-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
with extraction on griff aswell?


[31-Jan-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
or no


[31-Jan-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
tbh I can def find a more sutable planer if it doesnt need to have HAL


[31-Jan-25 11:33 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[31-Jan-25 11:33 AM] laaxus#0000
when talking about profit


[31-Jan-25 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
always do it for 500 area


[31-Jan-25 11:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
okok


[31-Jan-25 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
Choices are limited to griffonstone, elon, ki-840c and electronica anyway


[31-Jan-25 11:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
52k


[31-Jan-25 11:35 AM] laaxus#0000
not great


[31-Jan-25 11:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[31-Jan-25 11:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
when buying hal myself its 61k

yeah, it isn't bad


[31-Jan-25 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
60k isn't bad


[31-Jan-25 11:38 AM] laaxus#0000
but it's not extra great


[31-Jan-25 11:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
if I made pure EXT base on haceon its much better


[31-Jan-25 11:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
100k


[31-Jan-25 11:38 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah but it's shipping heavy


[31-Jan-25 11:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
and I can mine CLI in case anyhting goes bad


[31-Jan-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
cant be as much as H2O

[01-Feb-25 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
Either Ice Station Alpha in the Thalassa system, or Etherwind in New Antares

"ice" station alpha

[01-Feb-25 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
ISA is a lot closer but more expensive to build on

[01-Feb-25 12:32 PM] jvaler#0000
nope, only the base needs extra building/repair materials


[01-Feb-25 12:32 PM] jvaler#0000

i dont have max area on it, but realisticaly it will be weeks before il max it

so thats not part of my equation


[01-Feb-25 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ah, that‚Äôs why


[01-Feb-25 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
The CM (base module) is a fixed cost


[01-Feb-25 12:39 PM] pagy1234#0000
but thats still insane no?


[01-Feb-25 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
So the ROI gets smaller as you use the base to produce more profit


[01-Feb-25 12:39 PM] jvaler#0000

[01-Feb-25 12:40 PM] jvaler#0000
ROI isn't the only consideration, actual profit/d becomes more important later on


[01-Feb-25 12:40 PM] jvaler#0000

[01-Feb-25 12:41 PM] jvaler#0000
@sidepipe @tanda 1 STO + 4 WAR fits 4 LCB loads of H2O, that's plenty of leeway for me given i've got 4 LCBs in my fleet now


[01-Feb-25 12:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
id much rather mine HAL than get H2O, even if it has nothing to do with my current buisnesses


[01-Feb-25 12:43 PM] jvaler#0000
pretty good still, 50-60k/d is what a logi intensive deimos AL base makes when the market's still decent for it lolol


[01-Feb-25 12:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
In general, diversifying is more profitable than vertical integration, but also riskier (since the price of HAL could also crash, but if you make your own water you have a guaranteed ‚Äúprice‚Äù)

[01-Feb-25 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
Early on, I‚Äôd focus on doing a few different profitable things since you want to make the most of the cash you have, but it‚Äôs really up to how you wanna play / what you‚Äôre comfortable with


[01-Feb-25 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
And the risk isn‚Äôt huge. I‚Äôve been playing for a year and I‚Äôve only ever had one base that just stopped being profitable altogether


[01-Feb-25 12:45 PM] pagy1234#0000
il need more than 1 base of H2O to supply my CURRENT consumption lol


[01-Feb-25 12:45 PM] jvaler#0000
yup lol


[01-Feb-25 12:45 PM] jvaler#0000
DW is hungry


[01-Feb-25 12:45 PM] jvaler#0000
my ISA base doesn't fully feed my setup either, i buy off CX too


[01-Feb-25 12:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
I use the PE recipe for my base just so I can feed it all from etherwind


[01-Feb-25 12:46 PM] pagy1234#0000
even now that I introduced some RAT production in, i just barely use less than the 500 area H2O base


[01-Feb-25 12:47 PM] pagy1234#0000
thats pretty crazy to me


[01-Feb-25 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
It might be worth checking the PE recipe in your base to see what it does to the consumption (if feeding it all from one h2o base is the goal)


[01-Feb-25 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
But as long as there‚Äôs water on the CX, you might as well do what makes you the most money


[01-Feb-25 12:49 PM] pagy1234#0000
il do some math tmr to figure out what the breaking point of H2O price is to justify making a base for it


[01-Feb-25 12:49 PM] pagy1234#0000
even just a small one


[01-Feb-25 12:49 PM] tanda#0000
I can definitely say I regret doing 1 STO here

if you're gonna go for an ISA base you should probably be going all or nothing, due to the environmental construction costs that CM seems to make your ROI pretty terrible at low RIG counts


[01-Feb-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000

if i do DW with PE recipe, then adjust so that DW output is the same, I consume about 350 H2O less per day


[01-Feb-25 12:56 PM] pagy1234#0000
down from 1800 to  1450


[01-Feb-25 12:57 PM] jvaler#0000
you gotta calculate if the reduction in recipe speed is worth the efficiency gain


[01-Feb-25 12:57 PM] pagy1234#0000
wdym?


[01-Feb-25 12:57 PM] jvaler#0000
well the PG recipe takes longer to run than the non-PG recipe, but it produces 10 DW instead of 7, so it's more efficient


[01-Feb-25 12:57 PM] jvaler#0000
so you could be getting more DW per H2O, but it produces too much slower that it isn't worth that gain


[01-Feb-25 12:58 PM] pagy1234#0000
il be making 500 less DW a day


[01-Feb-25 12:59 PM] pagy1234#0000

Profit percentage is not as important as profit per day


[01-Feb-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
raw recipe: 99000/198000 = 0.5 
PE recipe: 136000/274000 = 0.496

oh lol


[01-Feb-25 01:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
so back to this, efficiency in terms of H2O is better with PE, in terms of margins its the same, in terms of pure money raw recipe is better


[01-Feb-25 01:15 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah margins basically don't matter


[01-Feb-25 01:16 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[01-Feb-25 01:16 PM] manhim#0000
They might matter at the beginning, because it will cost less to build an inventory, which means that you can build more bases faster


[01-Feb-25 01:16 PM] pagy1234#0000
il stick to my recipe


[01-Feb-25 01:17 PM] pagy1234#0000
this is what I was thinking about, but if I can get more total money, the margins isnt super important unless theres a massive discrepancy in it


[01-Feb-25 01:17 PM] realharvey#0000
If you make more profit per day you build bases faster üëÄ


[01-Feb-25 01:18 PM] manhim#0000
If you need 5m of inventory to last 2 weeks VS 0.5m of inventory, it means that you could build 2 more bases

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[01-Feb-25 01:18 PM] manhim#0000
But yeah, profit need to be considered, but there are lots of strategies. Like optimizing logistics.


[01-Feb-25 01:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, early on margins are super important because you wanna turn your 100k AIC into 150k AIC as fast as possible. Later on, that shifts because money is much less of a limitation, so if you can invest 200k at a 50% margin, or 1.5M at a 20% margin, it's better to choose the second one because you make more money even though it's less capital efficient. At least, that's how I like to think about it


[01-Feb-25 01:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
As you get larger, it's less about earning the best return on your limited investment, and more about earning _any_ return on as much of your money as possible


[01-Feb-25 01:26 PM] realharvey#0000
Well in that case ROI of a base with a recipe is still way more worth than actual Margin. üòÖ


[01-Feb-25 01:27 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, I've been building up my inventories from 14 to 21 days on all my bases and I haven't been able to build a new base with my own money in 7 weeks üòÖ


[01-Feb-25 01:27 PM] tanda#0000
my third most profitable base runs an 18% margin


[01-Feb-25 01:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm kinda in a similar situation - as profits go up, margins tend to go down (ignore the bottom 5 bases, some of them are getting rebuilt / resupplied üòÑ )

My most profitable base is my O extraction half permit base with 90% margin ü§£


[01-Feb-25 01:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
Sort of, but you need to look at the ROI in combination with the actual investment you're earning a return on (if I'm understanding you correctly)


[01-Feb-25 01:32 PM] jvaler#0000
resource extraction bases kinda game the margin lol

yes, that's my AR tap. I was shocked to see the profit on it


[01-Feb-25 01:36 PM] tanda#0000
I guess it makes up for ALL of my INS bases making sub 70k now


[01-Feb-25 01:43 PM] evov#0000
imo, the 2 numbers that make the most sense when looking at the "value" of a base.

1. RoI - How long does it take to generate profits equal to the cost of the base.
2. $ / Area / Day - How much profit per day can I make from the use of the permit.

There is tension between these two numbers. Generally... the lower tier / cheaper bases have better RoI, but worse $/Area/Day. Higher tier bases will earn more $ for your permit, but cost a lot more to set up.

Which number makes more sense to use, depends on the cost of your next permit. As a really rough guide - I would say if you're <20 permits - focus on RoI -  As you get more than 20 permits - Start looking more closely at $/Area/Day. Once you're 30+ permits, you no longer care what the cost of the base is to set up because your permits will cost more than double whatever base you might want to build.

As long as we don't look at shipping costs üòÖ


[01-Feb-25 03:06 PM] pxlfox.#0000
the shipping costs are not really the problem


[01-Feb-25 03:06 PM] pxlfox.#0000
the shipping capacity is


[01-Feb-25 03:08 PM] pxlfox.#0000
a full EXT base often needs at least one WCB full time to transport the ores


[01-Feb-25 03:08 PM] pxlfox.#0000
but one EXT base can support 2-3 SME bases, depending on the ore


[01-Feb-25 03:10 PM] pxlfox.#0000
it kinda is - margin and ROI are great, except the actual profit is relatively small (mostly around 50k a day)


[01-Feb-25 03:10 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and again, you can't let them sit too long, because they will fill up quite quickly


[01-Feb-25 03:11 PM] pxlfox.#0000
even the less efficient EXT bases need an export visit every 3-4 days


[01-Feb-25 03:14 PM] pxlfox.#0000
On that note... I kinda working on something to make ores fun again. And support the ANT region, too. More as soon as I have more concrete to show for


[01-Feb-25 03:17 PM] jvaler#0000
shipping capacity = shipping cost tho lol


[01-Feb-25 03:17 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, going over capacity forces you to buy more ships / downscale logistics


[01-Feb-25 03:18 PM] manhim#0000
Then you have fuel and ship repairs


[01-Feb-25 03:18 PM] jvaler#0000
or pay for LM shipping


[01-Feb-25 03:18 PM] manhim#0000
True


[01-Feb-25 03:20 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I take shipping costs as the actual amount you have to pay to transport the materials from A to B (fuel + repairs)
Shipping capacity is what my company effectively can transport in a period of time, mostly limited by the amount of ships I have or vacant space on other ships on that route


[01-Feb-25 03:20 PM] pxlfox.#0000
(a.k.a. LM ads)


[01-Feb-25 03:21 PM] pxlfox.#0000
those definetly correlate, but what I want to say is - if you have the capacity, it's not that expensive to ship the ores.

{Reactions}
true 

[01-Feb-25 03:21 PM] pxlfox.#0000
the hard part is to have the ships to transport it

[02-Feb-25 02:26 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I was running low. Thought about building a base. But it was just cheaper to buy out all the PSL/PSM and set the price nice and high. Hopefully other people start to build bases for it to get the supply back up.

Like lazycorp did for fim


[02-Feb-25 02:31 AM] evov#0000
I've been putting bids up every week and they rarely get filled. Pretty sure this way will actually increase production. And if it doesn't..... I'll build another base myself.

If PG is a concern, there's a chem planet next door on IA-151d.

They're less than 1 day's flight from ANT and HRT, and I have a very strong feeling that at some point, there'll be a gateway linking that system back to ANT.

[02-Feb-25 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
@pagy1234 if you're interested in "refinancing" that, let me know - I'll just send you another 0 interest loan for the 400k you have left, but over a much longer period so the payments are smaller


[02-Feb-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah that would be great, If I could spread out to 400k into 4 payments of 100k sread out over 4 weeks then that would be perfect


[02-Feb-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
would give me a bit of breathing room should DW go any lower


[02-Feb-25 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
how about 8 weeks of 50k?


[02-Feb-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah sure, that works aswell :D


[02-Feb-25 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
since you're not doing a full FP RAT base, that'll give you plenty of time to chew through the stuff while mostly focusing on DW


[02-Feb-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[02-Feb-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
should I send you the cont?

[02-Feb-25 02:36 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Well, its still thousands of units, and I'm still quite small.


[02-Feb-25 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
Just keep in mind there's an internal market. Nobody in ADI should be paying market rates on INS


[02-Feb-25 02:39 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
But I think the bigger issue is just needing INS to begin with.


[02-Feb-25 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, INS is still half a mil to the cost of a new base even when it is really cheap


[02-Feb-25 02:40 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Ah, yes, once I know what I'm doing I'll definately hit you up


[02-Feb-25 02:40 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I still have some area left in my first two bases so I'm filling that in first.


[02-Feb-25 02:41 PM] tanda#0000
that is a good call


[02-Feb-25 02:42 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Then its either water from Ice station alpha, a chem base that has a few possibilities, or 1-2 other ideas that are pretty absurd and probably not great at this stage.


[02-Feb-25 02:42 PM] igfloz#0000
indeed, get your current maximized 1st is a very good idea. No need to waste permits on expanding, just maximize the 500 area


[02-Feb-25 02:42 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, I'm at like 400 and 450 though (and can optimize a small amount within that by trading out old buildings for more optimal ones).

I'll be over 1M weekly revenue next week (just barely missed it this week) with a large chunk (40-50%) of that being profit.

So, AGP success story I guess.


[02-Feb-25 02:43 PM] igfloz#0000
very nice  !!


[02-Feb-25 02:52 PM] igfloz#0000
It's also worth noting (as Tanda has indicated) - whatever Prunplanner indicates as the cost for a new base build can be mitigated somewhat with internal offers


[02-Feb-25 03:04 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
yeah, down to 100 for INS (tanda's listed price) would be... nice.


[02-Feb-25 03:04 PM] tanda#0000
I've been giving thought to going lower. ADI doesn't make up the bulk of my volume right now


[03-Feb-25 12:59 AM] evov#0000
Got my first HCB (5k5k cargo bay) rolling off the line in 1day, 10hrs. So, about 2 days from now I'll have a 5k5k ship available to sell.

I've had a number of people wanting to pre-buy them, or put orders in for the ships before they're built. But that's not how I roll. So I'm trying to figure out how I should sell/distribute the first few of these in-demand prestige (at the moment) ships. Looking for thoughts ideas on any of the following.

A. Public auction - Open up for bids each time a ship rolls off the line. Highest bid in a 24hr window gets the ship. (Seems kinda interesting and fun)

B. Change (increase) the price until the demand for the ship matches my capacity to supply. (The free market maximalist in me thinks this makes sense as I worship at the altar of supply and demand)

C. Hold to what I expect my long term pricing to be, but prioritize access to ships based on my level of interaction with people in game. i.e. people that are part of my projects or that I regularly colaborate with. ( Most likely first purchase options will go to people who joined me in the IA project )

D. Avoid the drama and just make them for myself until the market levels out and other suppliers are also meeting demand.


[03-Feb-25 01:06 AM] jcheung#0000
auction for the first few would probably be good


[03-Feb-25 01:06 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe like... first 10


[03-Feb-25 01:06 AM] jcheung#0000
but instead of 24 hrs, do it as ending 12 hrs after last bid


[03-Feb-25 01:06 AM] jcheung#0000
so people aren't stressed about sleep


[03-Feb-25 01:07 AM] jcheung#0000
minimum price increase of.... 10% or 250k, whichever is higher to stop trolls


[03-Feb-25 01:08 AM] jcheung#0000
then swap to C or D


[03-Feb-25 01:08 AM] jcheung#0000
at least that's my two cents


[03-Feb-25 01:08 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I've given zero thought as to how to actually run an auction. But it seemed like a fun  (and economically relevant option)


[03-Feb-25 01:09 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm not super familiar with auctions either, but i do know that when it involves the world....


[03-Feb-25 01:09 AM] jcheung#0000
having it end too fast makes people upset


[03-Feb-25 01:09 AM] jcheung#0000
like something else that could be done is, uh...


[03-Feb-25 01:10 AM] evov#0000
I feel like an open bidding option would be cool, but some sort of discord tool would be needed for it probably. The easy option would just be - msg me your bid. Top bid in the next 24 hrs over the min price wins.


[03-Feb-25 01:11 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm sure there's a name for it, but
player A gives a max price thay're willing to pay.
current bid increases by 250k
player B gives a max price. it's under A's.
current bid increases to B + 250k
player C gives a max price. higher than A's.
current bid increases to A + 250k, and C's max is something higher


[03-Feb-25 02:48 AM] realharvey#0000
Your second option sounds like the best way to do it. It's still fair and way less tedious. Also more potential profit for you.

What would be the minimum bid?


[03-Feb-25 02:49 AM] laaxus#0000

[03-Feb-25 03:03 AM] evov#0000
Settled down price for the ships will be about 11mil / ship I think.
It's just right now, WAL price is stupid high and there's a lot of excitement/prestiege etc. So no idea how to price the first couple - but eventually price (from me at least) will trend towards 11mil. I've heard other people mention similar prices.

Thats an insane price per HCB then. But yeah novelty product


[03-Feb-25 03:21 AM] realharvey#0000
You don't reaaally need it.


[03-Feb-25 03:22 AM] realharvey#0000
On the other hand it's better than 2 2k2ks just way less flexible


[03-Feb-25 03:22 AM] realharvey#0000
Good for construction and metallurgy


[03-Feb-25 03:33 AM] evov#0000
Yea, the HCB is a lot more expensive. And the extra size uses a lot more Field emitters, more LHP, more SSC etc. CQL vs CQM also adds a bit. So there's a few area's that impact the cost difference.


[03-Feb-25 05:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
A first cuz it will be fun, with some option D in between cuz i assume that these 5k/5k ships will go for absurd amounts, then do B cuz money is nice

[03-Feb-25 08:21 AM] roche3950#0000
Open bidding would be cool bc it creates price transparency


[03-Feb-25 08:29 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I believe it is a "second price auction" (with a minimum bid increase)


[03-Feb-25 08:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
if you have something like the time only ends 12h after the most recent bid then it should be fine no?


[03-Feb-25 08:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
someone can go to sleep after placing their bid then still wake up to place a higher one if they got beat


[03-Feb-25 08:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
might take a few days to end, but i dont think theres a way around that


[03-Feb-25 08:34 AM] jcheung#0000
That's my suggestion, but evov isn't required to do what i say üòú


[03-Feb-25 08:34 AM] pagy1234#0000

[03-Feb-25 08:35 AM] realharvey#0000
It will make the bidding process just unnecessary longer in my opinion


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] realharvey#0000
when there are completly different timezones bidding just the minimum increase it could take multiple days, because there will be only 1-2 bids while both are present at the same time


[03-Feb-25 08:37 AM] realharvey#0000
Just give your maximum bid to Evo and the job is done. Less busywork and quicker results. Not as fancy but gets the job done


[03-Feb-25 08:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
well the next ships wont be ready for some time right? could just open like 2 or 3 auctions and by the time they are over the ships might be ready


[03-Feb-25 08:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
meh, fair enough ig, kinda boring tho (as a spectator)


[03-Feb-25 08:40 AM] jcheung#0000
hence my other option of second price auction, you bid your limit but don't get screwed if your limit is a lot higher than everyone else's


[03-Feb-25 08:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
then cant some people just say like 100mil to guarantee the ship and just pay what ever the significatly lower price of the second one is?


[03-Feb-25 08:43 AM] jcheung#0000
as long as they're willing to take the risk of someone offering 99m and they have to pay 99.25m

[03-Feb-25 08:57 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, you can say 100M, but you have to be ready to pay 100M when you say that.  (For example, if you bid 100M first and a second person also bids 100M, but later than you did).

Why would Evo not take the Extraprofit? :D 
Evo reacts to the current marketconditions and if he can make profit with that he takes it.


[03-Feb-25 08:58 AM] jcheung#0000
because it looks like they settled in on a different option?


[03-Feb-25 08:59 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
The nice thing about second price is that, generally, you only need one bid (the max willingness to pay) from each bidder.  You don't need timeouts for the next person to bid.


[03-Feb-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, the system should be :
- everybody offers their highest bid
- the highest bidder must pay the second highest bid + 1%


[03-Feb-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
You can't make it simpler


[03-Feb-25 08:59 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
You're assuming no tie bids, but otherwise yes.

[03-Feb-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
and it's fair


[03-Feb-25 09:00 AM] jcheung#0000
you also assume that people with money catch wind of that auction in only 24 hrs


[03-Feb-25 09:00 AM] laaxus#0000
In case of tie for the highest bid, just inform there's a tie to the highest bidder, and restart at step 1 (with only the selected people)


[03-Feb-25 09:00 AM] jcheung#0000
i mean


[03-Feb-25 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000
at that point it's better to just take the tie bids and ask who wants it more


[03-Feb-25 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000
if you restart at step 1 you risk getting less money


[03-Feb-25 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000
like if it ties at 20m and you restart, they just bid 10m and walk off


[03-Feb-25 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
that's unlikely


[03-Feb-25 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
or just decide that the oldest bid wins over the newest one


[03-Feb-25 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
as a tie breaker

[03-Feb-25 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
a tie breaker is a tie breaker
If you really wanted it more, you just had to put a higher bid

[03-Feb-25 09:03 AM] jcheung#0000
because if it's 24 hrs blind auction, it's unfair to someone who was sleeping at the start

no

that doesn't work when you don't know what the high bid is


[03-Feb-25 09:04 AM] laaxus#0000
ofc you can


[03-Feb-25 09:04 AM] laaxus#0000
just put the bid at the highest cost you'd be ready to pay it for


[03-Feb-25 09:04 AM] laaxus#0000
by that definition


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] jcheung#0000
and if you're sleeping at auction start, but someone else who's willing to pay the same amount isn't...


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
you should not be unhappy if the ship goes away at that max price


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] jcheung#0000
that isn't fair to you to have your bid undercut just because they submitted it earlier


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
again, by definition, max price means no welfare gain


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
at max price, he didn't earned any happiness


[03-Feb-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
at max price + 1, he would have lossed 1 worth


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
at max price - 1, he would have earned 1


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
but at max price


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
the buyer consider the money and the ship are strictly equivalent


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
therefore


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
the buyer should not care if the ship goes to someone else at max price


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
if he's unhappy


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
then he just put an inappropriate max bid


[03-Feb-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
and that's his fault


[03-Feb-25 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
to the seller. but it's unfair to the buyer.


[03-Feb-25 09:14 AM] laaxus#0000
no no, to the buyer


[03-Feb-25 09:14 AM] laaxus#0000
the seller has nothing to do with this


[03-Feb-25 09:25 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Imagine you are buying a bag of cookies via this mechanism.

You should bid what you think the cookies are worth.  If you think they are worth $5 to you, you bid that.  In this case, you pay at most $5 and get a bag of cookies, if you pay less, you are explicitly happy ($5 worth of cookies for only $4!).  If you don't win the auction, you still have your $5 and are no worse off.  In particular, you are not unhappy because you didn't pay $8 for cookies that only give you $5 of enjoyment.


[03-Feb-25 09:28 AM] realharvey#0000
First come first serve is happening in a lot of scenarios in the world. It's unfair yes, but a necessary evil.

When you go to a supermarket and want to buy something at a discount it's possible that someone else bought it first.

I'll end up using most of it myself but i'll put some on the market in the mean time


[03-Feb-25 04:58 PM] evov#0000
Simpler (to me) would just be that I set the price for the first ship at 15mil. If it sells before I build the next ship, next ship price goes up. ./repeat.  If it doesn't sell by the time I've built up a comfortable amount of stock, maybe 5 ships, price goes down.

The auction idea sounds cool, and I do like it, but it feels like it might just end up adding more friction than it's worth.


[03-Feb-25 06:30 PM] wikifeia#0000
The flight mechanics in this game seem pretty buggy. Just by rapidly clicking one or both of the fuel allocation bars you can reduce flight time.


[03-Feb-25 06:31 PM] wikifeia#0000
It's most noticeable when you have both bars set to the minimum value, I can make 1 day trips reduce down to 16 hours or fewer.


[03-Feb-25 06:36 PM] .shiva.#0000
their pathfinding kind of sucks, and is non-deterministic. it'll generally swap between two routes each time you have it recalculate (by adjusting any of the fuel sliders)


[03-Feb-25 06:36 PM] .shiva.#0000
sometimes one of those routes is much better than the other


[03-Feb-25 06:36 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah. sometimes the time stays the same and damage or fuel use changes


[03-Feb-25 06:37 PM] jcheung#0000
sometimes there's even a 3rd route but those are rare and every time i see one i think i imagined it


[03-Feb-25 06:37 PM] jcheung#0000
i wish they would just give us porkchop plots


[03-Feb-25 07:13 PM] zillatron#0000
the source and destination are in constant motion so how much fuel you burn will change where you end up/how long it takes, like if you have to chase a planet in STL mode or if its coming toward you when you arrive in the system


[03-Feb-25 07:14 PM] zillatron#0000
ie. there's more variables in play than just how much fuel you burn


[03-Feb-25 07:15 PM] .shiva.#0000
it changes even if you don't change the amount of fuel


[03-Feb-25 07:15 PM] .shiva.#0000
like drag the FTL slider all the way to 0, and then just click it a few times


[03-Feb-25 07:17 PM] zillatron#0000
yep, you can trim time off the trip but im pretty sure you'll find something else is changing, like the STL cruise time or whatever


[03-Feb-25 07:18 PM] zillatron#0000
thats just my understanding/observation so ymmv


[03-Feb-25 07:46 PM] jcheung#0000
like i said, porkchop plots would be nice


[04-Feb-25 12:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Orbital mechanics are quite complex. I‚Äôm sure PrUn has a very simplified simulation, but most of us are here for the economy, not to simulate rocket science üòÖ

I always imagined those two routes be like: do I flight with the rotation of the planet, or against it. And depending on the position of the planet in its orbit, one of those routes is faster.


[04-Feb-25 01:28 AM] realharvey#0000
This is how prun does it. Clicking the fuel slider makes it go one of those two possibilities


[04-Feb-25 05:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you have a system map open while clicking it you can watch the path switch which side of the sun it goes around

Copy from Galactic deals on the UFO discord, how I'm handling the sales of 5k5k ships for the moment -
.e. 5k5k Ships.

At the moment, I know there's a lot of people wanting to buy them. I've had my first HCB roll off the lines. My plans (at the moment) - 

First one, I'll make for myself. I don't plan on selling ships that I don't also use.

Next one is due to be ready in about 3 days. In the long term, I intend to sell them for 11mil per ship. In the short term, while demand greatly exceeds the capacity to supply a more dynamic pricing structure is needed.

First ship for sale will be available for 15mil AIC. If it sells before I produce the next one, price for the next one goes up by 1mil. If it doesn't sell, price goes down by 1mil. The floor price will be 11mil (if I end up holding 5 full ships in stock)

They're new, they're pretty, lots of people want them, I expect this to be a very temporary situation.

[05-Feb-25 12:24 AM] evov#0000
Not really. I do sometimes sell excess stock of specific parts on the CX if/when the price is juicy enough. But for the most part, I'm in the business of selling full ships. Messing with contracts isn't worth the effort.

whats the difference between FRM and HYF? I see a couple people recently switching from FRM to HYF


[05-Feb-25 08:23 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
They produce slightly different things, FRM depends on planet fertility and HYF does not.  Inputs are different for the same items.  (HYF alyways needs NS)


[05-Feb-25 08:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
ahh, so HYF can be made anywhere im assuming?


[05-Feb-25 08:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
but probably more expensive


[05-Feb-25 08:24 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I believe so.  Still benefits from agriculture COGC

But, for example, you can't grow CAF on a FRM or HER in a HYF.

much smaller recipe choice though


[05-Feb-25 08:35 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000

prolly wont get any for some time


[05-Feb-25 09:04 AM] magican1980#0000
yes, it will take time for the change for HYF üôÇ - FRM produce with a little Water, HYF take more Water and Nutrient Solution (NS) to make the same in less time - HYF cost more (because more building mats) and you need to fullfill the needs of settlers üôÇ


[05-Feb-25 09:05 AM] magican1980#0000
with HYF = 20 Water + 2 NS = 12 MAI in 19hours 12 min (without boni), with FRM = 4 Water = 12 MAI in 33 hours


[05-Feb-25 09:08 AM] magican1980#0000
for other products you invest massiv more water and NS to get the items faster. on the other side you can run more Food Processor to make Rations

On principle - I feel like I need to wait until I've got the full ship in stock ready to ship out. I don't like selling things I don't have üôÇ

Is there anyway to see who is settled on a planet? If I wanted to see who all is on a certain planet?


[06-Feb-25 09:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
In the PLI buffer, you can click on all the plots to see which belongs to who, but that's the easiest way I know of

checking the plots worked great since the planet doesn't have too many on it

that would make it a challenge üòÖ


[07-Feb-25 01:08 AM] magican1980#0000
oh you want your own water - check etherwind KW-688 - you dont need INS for your base


[07-Feb-25 01:11 AM] potaterror#0000

Hello @mzevilcanadian 
It's here that we talk the most


[07-Feb-25 02:40 AM] laaxus#0000
don't hesitate to ask questions


[07-Feb-25 02:41 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Thanks!


[07-Feb-25 02:41 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'm looking at your grand thingy rn


[07-Feb-25 02:41 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Is there a planet/resource in need that would be more benificial for me to focus on?


[07-Feb-25 02:42 AM] laaxus#0000
don't hesitate to use the #internal-offers internal market either, it's there to be used !


[07-Feb-25 02:42 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'll be sure to take a look!


[07-Feb-25 02:43 AM] laaxus#0000
there are bases more profitable than others
but ultimately, you should have fun


[07-Feb-25 02:43 AM] jcheung#0000


[07-Feb-25 02:43 AM] jcheung#0000
are you planning on manually moving to ant, or coliq?


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Manually moving


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend keeping promitor


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] jcheung#0000
^


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] laaxus#0000
it's the best planet in the universe


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] jcheung#0000
that might put a strain on your shipping though


[07-Feb-25 02:44 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I was thinking I could use promitor to make basic consummables for myself and maybe get into welding/smelting or something


[07-Feb-25 02:45 AM] jcheung#0000
i would suggest, but you are not required to, that you consider something with light shipping needs for your first base in ANT space


[07-Feb-25 02:45 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
That is a good idea


[07-Feb-25 02:45 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
What, out there, looks to be on the more profitable side?


[07-Feb-25 02:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Usually, the more risky, the more profitable the base is
Meaning that you have to decide what's the risk you like to play with


[07-Feb-25 02:47 AM] laaxus#0000
when it's high profit low risk (like fim currently) everybody rush it, lowering the price


[07-Feb-25 02:47 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Ahhh ok, I got some planning to do :p


[07-Feb-25 02:47 AM] laaxus#0000
Do you know how to use prunplanner ?


[07-Feb-25 02:48 AM] laaxus#0000
(do you know what prunplanner is ?)


[07-Feb-25 02:48 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I do, yeah. I played previously for about 14 months before I stopped, came back to nothing :p


[07-Feb-25 02:50 AM] laaxus#0000
here's a few ideas of bases you could look at (I intentionaly put a few that I don't think you should do at first, but they're worth looking at)


[07-Feb-25 02:53 AM] laaxus#0000
Construction :
- PP2
Manufacturing :
- BMP 
- PPF 
Food production :
- FP
Agriculture :
- FRM
Resource extraction :
- INC (C burning on nascent)
- EXT
Chemistry
- CHP
- POL
Smelting :
- SME
- GF


[07-Feb-25 02:56 AM] laaxus#0000
but if you feel overwhelmed you may want to start by looking at FRM SME BMP PP2 :p


[07-Feb-25 02:57 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I appreciate the info! I was thinking of doing food/water but have only found 1 planet in the region where that may be possible


[07-Feb-25 02:57 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd not recommend entering the DW market right now


[07-Feb-25 02:57 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Oh?


[07-Feb-25 02:57 AM] laaxus#0000
H2O market even less


[07-Feb-25 02:58 AM] laaxus#0000
Basically, everybody entered the DW recently as it was a cash grab


[07-Feb-25 02:59 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Ahhh ok


[07-Feb-25 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
however, people started moving their production from DW to RAT  FIM as it was a even bigger cash grab


[07-Feb-25 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
you may want to ask @pagy1234 how he feels about producing DW


[07-Feb-25 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
he is a recent AGP applicant that built a FP base, doing DW on norwick


[07-Feb-25 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000

I made a group on the FIO website, and put in the settings for a project on PRUNPlanner, but it seems to be taking forever for FIO to load on the planner website


[07-Feb-25 03:33 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't need fio to use prunplanner


[07-Feb-25 03:33 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
ok Im using it wrong then


[07-Feb-25 03:34 AM] laaxus#0000
you can just create an account


[07-Feb-25 03:34 AM] laaxus#0000
and create bases

[07-Feb-25 04:31 AM] magican1980#0000
If you use or active FIO in Prunplaner and calculate Supply for 21 days - Prunplaner shows you what you need and will tell you the need materials with include the stock (difference)


[07-Feb-25 05:35 AM] potaterror#0000
I mean, honestly, even a short-term water base wouldn't be a terrible idea depending on where you did it.


[07-Feb-25 05:36 AM] potaterror#0000
A couple projects are absolutely thirsting for Boucher permits.


[07-Feb-25 05:37 AM] potaterror#0000
Could be a way to make a quick cash grab and then roll it up into a share of a larger scheme when things calm down.


[07-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
Helloooüëãüëã


[07-Feb-25 06:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
DW works well on norwick, got 149% efficiency iirc, but DW market took a dip recently so bleh


[07-Feb-25 06:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
H2O price increased 30-40% in the last week so its expensive asf to produce DW now


[07-Feb-25 06:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
Earnings went from easily over 100k with 2 half built bases to just over 80k on a good day


[07-Feb-25 06:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
Was given a nice gift yesterday so im well on my way to building a 3rd base for H2O (on ISA), then il be able to sustain my farms on Harmonia and some portion of my DW production, aiming to rotate mostly to RAT within the next 3 to 5 days.


[07-Feb-25 06:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
Expanding farms is also pretty cheap so if i wasnt targeting to make a H2O base then I would  max my farm base


[07-Feb-25 06:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
Overall the FRM and FP combo is really versatile, so personally I like it, and profits are pretty solid


[07-Feb-25 06:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, honestly making consumables is very good (IMO) cuz then you just make everything cheaper for your self while making solid profits


[07-Feb-25 06:29 AM] tanda#0000
I know your context differs, but that's not a bad rate of return for producing a basic good


[07-Feb-25 06:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
Feel free to ping me unlimited if I didnt answer well and you need more info


[07-Feb-25 06:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
Well 20% drop is bad, but overall its still nice


[07-Feb-25 06:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
Used to be very OP


[07-Feb-25 06:31 AM] tanda#0000
It was so nice for so long it actually outperformed the actual money printers, lol


[07-Feb-25 06:31 AM] tanda#0000
even off COGC


[07-Feb-25 06:36 AM] magican1980#0000
if you make your own water for DW, then it is a good money printer for new player :), but I think the logistic are the greater problem for the starter ships


[07-Feb-25 06:37 AM] tanda#0000
that's part of the reason I was suggesting people start FP bases on Phobos for a while. Base paid itself off in 7 days, and it's right next to the CX, making shipping relatively trivial

Someone just bought out about a 10c/u window of DW at ANT and put 140K units on the market, so if anyone's looking to turn a quick buck...


[08-Feb-25 02:54 AM] tanda#0000
drown them. honestly at 20/unit split from the other CXs, just import and drown him

Alas, all my DW is on AJ-293a and all my FTL ships are ~2 days from being able to come back with water, even from either nearby CX. Someone else will have to milk this cow.

It's all about the _texture_.


[08-Feb-25 03:17 AM] potaterror#0000
I'm just going to imagine their Boucher base is 1 RIG at max decay and a lot of STO.


[08-Feb-25 03:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
they probably extract water and make DW there. It's probably the only thing they do.


[08-Feb-25 03:19 AM] tanda#0000
what kills me is the fact that you can have as many as 6 permits on Free


[08-Feb-25 03:19 AM] tanda#0000
they have only used (at most) 3 permits

Sometimes I Wonder how many people don't know you Can build more based


[08-Feb-25 03:19 AM] tanda#0000
so they looked at their shipping capacity, maxed out a Boucher base, and decided they wanted nothing else from the world


[08-Feb-25 03:20 AM] tanda#0000
I'm going to assume that a 3 year player knows they can deploy more than one base

Expenses: cost of input goods and consumables
Revenue: cost of output goods
Repairs: cost of materials for repairs


[08-Feb-25 10:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, but the cost values are massively higher than what I currently spend on consumables and stuff

The cost of any material as calculated as a weighted average over all trades of all CXs over the last 7d

I would love to support the ore extraction and metal production of the region, since those are often the base of a lot of industries. In my experience, the most limiting factor is shipping, so I'm thinking to establish trade routes between common resource extraction sites and smelting planets (e.g. Nascent <-> Deimos) with vacant capacities, so people can just extract the stuff and I do the logistics.

[09-Feb-25 12:18 PM] wikifeia#0000
my thought is that with heph nearby it's strange that this little metallurgy is enough to meet demand


[09-Feb-25 12:19 PM] wikifeia#0000
i think as supply goes up demand will rise to meet it


[09-Feb-25 12:19 PM] laaxus#0000
vulcan and deimos  are enoughfor a large part of the demand


[09-Feb-25 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000

[09-Feb-25 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
took me a bit to learn this


[09-Feb-25 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
but deimos and vulcan are better at supplying heph than A


[09-Feb-25 12:25 PM] jcheung#0000
deimos being cheaper to build a base, vulcan having a FEO deposit


[09-Feb-25 12:25 PM] jcheung#0000
and A is also really close to the sun so that damages you


[09-Feb-25 12:28 PM] jcheung#0000
the rest of the system doesn't particularly have any great reasons to be metallurgy focused


[09-Feb-25 12:29 PM] jcheung#0000
meanwhile, antares 3 has a metallurgy world, which the jump to ant 2 A would be cheaper than some other options

I see you've gotten a lot of responses about this already, but I wanted to explain my line of thought.
I do construction, so I see decentish planets close by and I wonder why they shouldn't be another construction planet. Construction takes up a lot of permits, but I can supply more than one BFAB base with one metallurgy planet. 
There's no point of focusing a system on metallurgy. You put your metallurgy COGCs either on the planet with the metal deposit you want to take advantage of or very close by.
We are spoiled for choice for TIO deposits already in ANT. The one on 759j is less than 50% of galactic maximum, while we have 4 nearbyish that are over 65%.
That and metallurgy planets aren't very profitable right now

For anyone interested in differences between 2k2k and 5k5k ships. Both ships at ANT - going to SE-648c to pick up Oxygen. 5K5K on the left, 2k2k on the right. For the same flight time - fuel usage is about 30% higher on the 5k5k ( both ships empty )

looks like the sheer size of the 5k means it takes more damage in landing (and probably takeoff)


[10-Feb-25 03:58 AM] tanda#0000
it takes an extra 50% damage on that one step


[10-Feb-25 04:20 AM] evov#0000
I mean, when empty the total damage is pretty close. When full it's a little bit more, but not a huge amount more. Given that it's also carrying 2.5x the cargo, it feels like a very effective tradeoff (assuming you actually need to be transporting more than 2k2k cargo to/from a location - which is probably isn't actually supper common )

well, depends on how often you want to visit! With a 5k/5k in my arsenal, all my INS bases drop to being serviced once every 20 days


[10-Feb-25 05:03 AM] realharvey#0000
You might need more STO on location to handle this amount of deliveries when dealing with heavy stuff


[10-Feb-25 05:04 AM] tanda#0000
PP3 bases (especially those doing just INS) have a lot of space left over with just the two STO you can normally fit


[10-Feb-25 05:05 AM] tanda#0000
Nike's an artifact from not use hybrid pop buildings, but the other three are pretty good examples

[10-Feb-25 05:06 AM] tanda#0000
all three of those bases have over a week's worth of consumables and materials


[10-Feb-25 05:26 AM] realharvey#0000
I personally stock consumables 30-60 days. But consumables are still light on storage.
I guess metallurgy and extraction planets are more likely to need more STO


[10-Feb-25 05:42 AM] tanda#0000
I would also suggest that metallurgy planets in general and RE planets with a mass:volume ratio great than 2:1 are probably not great candidates for a 5k


[10-Feb-25 05:43 AM] jcheung#0000
Honestly that fuel and damage is a steal


[10-Feb-25 05:43 AM] jcheung#0000
Over double the capacity


[10-Feb-25 05:43 AM] jcheung#0000
Less than double the cost


[10-Feb-25 05:43 AM] tanda#0000
agreed. For middle of the road, high volume or infrequent visit bases it seems like a solid deal


[10-Feb-25 05:44 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd consider it on a case by case basis. Does a 5k/5k carry more than two 3k/1k's then I'd still go for the HCB


[10-Feb-25 05:44 AM] realharvey#0000
but this is more for "lategame". In the earlier stages you need that flexibility of more smaller ships


[10-Feb-25 05:45 AM] realharvey#0000
because most people cant even afford 14 days of supplies etc.


[10-Feb-25 05:46 AM] tanda#0000
I generally load up 30 days of supplies as well, everytime the burn gets down around a week left. It's just snappier to say I've got over a week's worth on hand

[10-Feb-25 05:55 AM] evov#0000
imo - as long as you're filling the 5k5k - it still feels more efficient to run (fuel/repairs) than 3k1k heavies. But, it's double the cost, so probably only worth the expense for established players. Maybe as a 6th ship in someone's fleet it might start to make sense imo.

[10-Feb-25 05:56 AM] realharvey#0000
in early stages you need the flexibility, so I totally agree


[10-Feb-25 05:59 AM] jcheung#0000
Depending o  what you're hauling, yes


[10-Feb-25 06:00 AM] realharvey#0000
I also value less busywork pretty high. So even if 2 heavy cargo bays would be more efficient I might still go the lazy route


[10-Feb-25 06:19 AM] tanda#0000
that DW sure did go down!

[11-Feb-25 01:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Tho AL market is currently really good and Deimos close to the CX. It might make sense to just sell it on the market

No! Me. Sell all your AL to me!

~~evov will just buy it from the cx anyways~~


[11-Feb-25 01:21 AM] evov#0000
If I could, I'd unionize all the AL producers in ANT. Restrict the other region's access to our precious AL, and force them to pay top AIC for it.

But then people just keep producing it and undercutting each other until the price drops... and I have to buy it all again.


[11-Feb-25 01:25 AM] evov#0000
My CX data from about the last 6months for AL. I've bought over a quarter of a million AL over that time. Mostly from the ANT CX.

Fun-fact - before the industrial revolution, aluminium was actually way more valuable then gold and silver - especially pure.

Imagine your entire set of bases rely on C


[11-Feb-25 11:06 PM] zillatron#0000
i dont need to imagine, i was in that situation when i started


[11-Feb-25 11:06 PM] laaxus#0000
Then someone d√©cid√© to make C ten Time more expensive for the sake of it

It's just upseting lol


[11-Feb-25 11:07 PM] zillatron#0000
so you set yourself up to not be screwed by the market going bannas


[11-Feb-25 11:07 PM] zillatron#0000
because it will, for whatever reason, at some point

Prun is consid√©red relatively PvP free


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, but if moke fucks with the C market and i have 7k C, i can make a quick buck off it


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but we need _something_ to complain about üòÑ


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] laaxus#0000
So I understand why market chaos is not liked


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't really moralize prun market manipulation. but that's probably because i'm vertically integrated enough to ignore the common targets


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] jcheung#0000
psh. i can always find something to complain about


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] jcheung#0000
*always*


[11-Feb-25 11:08 PM] jvaler#0000
should i hoard it then? üëÄ

also putting up fat CX orders is so satisfying


[11-Feb-25 11:13 PM] zillatron#0000
my point was more along the line that complaining when someone buys out all the things doesnt really make sense to me


[11-Feb-25 11:13 PM] jcheung#0000
i mean


[11-Feb-25 11:13 PM] jcheung#0000
i wasn't complaining about it this particular time


[11-Feb-25 11:13 PM] zillatron#0000
more indirectly


[11-Feb-25 11:14 PM] zillatron#0000
the second point is waiting for someone to maybe do something to make a quick buck probs isnt a great long term strategy lol


[11-Feb-25 11:14 PM] jcheung#0000
i mean


[11-Feb-25 11:14 PM] jcheung#0000
on one side of the coin i'm waiting


[11-Feb-25 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
on the other side of the coin i have a stockpile of mats i use regularly


[11-Feb-25 11:15 PM] zillatron#0000
thats not what i mean


[11-Feb-25 11:15 PM] zillatron#0000
this is what i mean


[11-Feb-25 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
mmmhmmm. and if he never does it again, i slowly chip away at the pile myself


[11-Feb-25 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm not making a *loss*


[11-Feb-25 11:16 PM] zillatron#0000
ok let me re start


[11-Feb-25 11:16 PM] zillatron#0000
why is 'fucking with the market' an issue?


[11-Feb-25 11:16 PM] zillatron#0000
its just making money haha


[11-Feb-25 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
did i say it was an issue this time?


[11-Feb-25 11:17 PM] zillatron#0000
calling it fucking with the market kinda does imply that yes haha


[11-Feb-25 11:17 PM] zillatron#0000
anyway you do you man, its just curiosity on my part


[11-Feb-25 11:17 PM] jcheung#0000
no, i just used it as a condition. if(mokeManipulatesMarket == true){sell C}else{use C}


[11-Feb-25 11:18 PM] zillatron#0000
cool cool


[11-Feb-25 11:18 PM] jcheung#0000
i get annoyed when things i buy get manipulated upwards, but i also don't see it as an issue

That's why I have spent a lot of time on non cx trading and contracts, I just need a source of C and I'll have everything covered. I favour the reliability of this method over the highs and lows of the market


[12-Feb-25 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
HEX is a meme


[12-Feb-25 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
It doesn't do anything


[12-Feb-25 01:31 AM] vanarazor#0000
ohhh


[12-Feb-25 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
No one produce it, no one buys it


[12-Feb-25 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, common pitfall


[12-Feb-25 01:32 AM] laaxus#0000
Just because the daily profit in prunplanner is high


[12-Feb-25 01:32 AM] laaxus#0000
Doesn't mean it's a good plan


[12-Feb-25 01:32 AM] laaxus#0000
(tho it means it's worth investigating)


[12-Feb-25 01:32 AM] vanarazor#0000
i used to play travian and ogame 10 -15 years ago, I understand the concept of specialised production


[12-Feb-25 01:34 AM] vanarazor#0000
yet for the first planet I thought diversified production was going to be more profitable


[12-Feb-25 01:34 AM] laaxus#0000
It's because you don't account for opportunity cost


[12-Feb-25 01:35 AM] vanarazor#0000
also a good way for me to learn the intricated craft system


[12-Feb-25 01:35 AM] vanarazor#0000
for example buying AL to use the recipe SI +AL instead of SI + C +O ?


[12-Feb-25 01:36 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes


[12-Feb-25 01:36 AM] laaxus#0000
To produce localy has one benefit : reducing shipping cost


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] laaxus#0000
But most of the Time, relying on the market is better


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] vanarazor#0000
which market are we talking about ?


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] laaxus#0000
CX


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] laaxus#0000
But don't believe me


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Make both bases in prunplanner


[12-Feb-25 01:37 AM] laaxus#0000
And compare

[12-Feb-25 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
if you want easy profit just pump a bunch of DW


[12-Feb-25 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
it's insane on the market right now


[12-Feb-25 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
and a simple chain


[12-Feb-25 01:44 AM] jcheung#0000
with the caveat that prunplanner is good, but not perfect


[12-Feb-25 01:45 AM] laaxus#0000
you should always make your own decisions


[12-Feb-25 01:46 AM] laaxus#0000
I can proudly says I was ahead of the community a few times


[12-Feb-25 01:46 AM] laaxus#0000
because I looked at the data


[12-Feb-25 01:46 AM] laaxus#0000
and found out that a few sector were going to be pretty profitable


[12-Feb-25 01:47 AM] laaxus#0000
and I made lot of juicy profit with it üòÑ


[12-Feb-25 01:47 AM] vanarazor#0000

@jcheung I hate loans


[12-Feb-25 02:03 AM] laaxus#0000
My only advice would be : pay a lot of attention at shipping cost


[12-Feb-25 02:03 AM] vanarazor#0000
How is that ?supply is : 454033 and demand is 54524, price was 18 AIC higher 2 months ago it did crashed 2 weeks ago but now back to 101 AIC

also you said my planet was not producing much water since it was cheaper to buy it (44.9) is 55AIC per unit profit worth it ?


[12-Feb-25 02:03 AM] laaxus#0000
It Can eat your entire profit if you don't pay attention enough (for beginnners)


[12-Feb-25 02:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
supply and demand numbers aren't really a helpfull metric in my experience


[12-Feb-25 02:04 AM] jcheung#0000
i didn't say produce your own dihydrogenmonoxide, buy that from the CX üòì


[12-Feb-25 02:05 AM] vanarazor#0000
No i've got that hence why I am asking about if 55 aic profit worth it


[12-Feb-25 02:07 AM] vanarazor#0000
is COF and PWO a must have? or DW RAT and OVE enough? does 100 % satisfaction greater population growth reward than 70 %?


[12-Feb-25 02:07 AM] jcheung#0000
bit shipping heavy, and it's not 55, but yes. it's worth it.


[12-Feb-25 02:07 AM] evov#0000
I still produce my own dihydrogenmonoxide. Not sure it's worth it, but still have a full base dedicated to it.


[12-Feb-25 02:08 AM] jcheung#0000
PWO is a must. COF is usually a good idea


[12-Feb-25 02:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
I can still count my bases number with my thumb only so


[12-Feb-25 02:08 AM] jcheung#0000

four. the next one is four.


[12-Feb-25 02:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
iirc, population growth is mainly based on the planets condition and less on the worker happiness of you base


[12-Feb-25 02:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so, I would say no


[12-Feb-25 02:12 AM] jcheung#0000
not talking about growth


[12-Feb-25 02:12 AM] jcheung#0000
this is workspeed


[12-Feb-25 02:13 AM] jcheung#0000
PWO is mandatory


[12-Feb-25 02:13 AM] jcheung#0000
COF at its current price depends on your product, but usually yes


[12-Feb-25 02:13 AM] vanarazor#0000
and COF is a must, god knows what I would do without my morning coffee

my workers are not even paid.. if they are with the production fee, means peanut to me (for now)


[12-Feb-25 02:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
worker consumables mainly affect there efficiency, therefore the amount you produce and your profit


[12-Feb-25 02:20 AM] vanarazor#0000
ooh yep, prunplanner is telling me that i'm losing 3K a day ..


[12-Feb-25 02:21 AM] vanarazor#0000
and it has not accounted for COF and PWO


[12-Feb-25 02:30 AM] vanarazor#0000
how can I add the right order in my production? inprunplanner?


[12-Feb-25 02:31 AM] laaxus#0000

if you opt for that though, i would spend some time planning out your next steps before doing the coliq

Hey did anyone have an FF order filled on ANT or BEN? Someone dropped 580,000 FF on ANT and 310,000 on BEN really cheaply, and it seems like it was a 7d account that was Unrated. Curious if my info is correct for that


[12-Feb-25 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Check your XIT CXTS for FF like 16 hours ago


[12-Feb-25 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
damn. wish i had a FF order up


[13-Feb-25 01:51 AM] vanarazor#0000
hey!! what do you mean by "base is filled out"?


[13-Feb-25 01:51 AM] vanarazor#0000
could I simply demolish production to opt towards better profit?


[13-Feb-25 01:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
probably until you fill out all 500 available spaces


[13-Feb-25 01:52 AM] vanarazor#0000
from what I get fromt he prplanner, the best option would be simply having 4 extractor


[13-Feb-25 01:52 AM] vanarazor#0000
ohhhhh


[13-Feb-25 01:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
sure - you will only get a fragment of the construction materials back, so keep that in mind


[13-Feb-25 01:54 AM] vanarazor#0000
nevermind, I guess I'm going to wait for more pop to just build more extrators then


[13-Feb-25 01:55 AM] vanarazor#0000
what's the range of the poulation review?


[13-Feb-25 01:55 AM] vanarazor#0000
is it by 100's?


[13-Feb-25 01:56 AM] vanarazor#0000
for example, as of right now, my workforce is 200 but I 'd required 240 , if I build some habitation, would that potentially give me 40 , 100 ? pop for the next pop review?  what would be the optimised way to grow population ?


[13-Feb-25 01:59 AM] vanarazor#0000
from what I gather from prplanner the HB1 defines my pop growth taking in account job opportunity


[13-Feb-25 02:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the HB1 provides space for workers


[13-Feb-25 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
"required" is what you need to full all jobs, "current" is the amount you currently have employed and "capacity" is the space you have. Capacity is defined by the habitats you build (e.g. HB1). You can't have more popultation then capacity, so you should always have build at least as much capacity as required.

[13-Feb-25 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
pop growth is defined by the planets condition


[13-Feb-25 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
which are monitored and regulated by the planets government


[13-Feb-25 02:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
normally, on basically all developed planets (which Phobos is), you will get your pioneers filled with the next population report (POPR), which is once a week.


[13-Feb-25 02:04 AM] vanarazor#0000
interesting


[13-Feb-25 02:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
to check the POPR of your planet, use `POPR <planet-code>` (e.g. `POPR ZV-759c`)


[13-Feb-25 02:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
you get the timestamp of the last report and can anticipate by that when the next one will be

[13-Feb-25 02:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so if your base requires more population and you have the capacity for it, you will get them filled in roughly 6 days


[13-Feb-25 02:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
crystal clear


[13-Feb-25 02:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
I defeinitely did not choose my production line profitably


[13-Feb-25 02:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
but prplanner is amazing


[13-Feb-25 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
couple points about this. 'open jobs' and 'unemployment' are slightly inaccurate, those are the values from before POPR. you need to modify them (the one not at 0) by the 'change'


[13-Feb-25 02:10 AM] vanarazor#0000
the most effective to address the situation is spamming EXT and HB accordingly


[13-Feb-25 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
so the planet is actually only 1281 scientists short


[13-Feb-25 02:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yep, basically. As you build production facilities you should also provide the required space for the workers

[13-Feb-25 02:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
how do you get that number ?


[13-Feb-25 02:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
pioneers and settlers will most like just fill up. Every other higher pop tier might need intervention by the government to get them filled


[13-Feb-25 02:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
scientifics were 9909 change was 143


[13-Feb-25 02:13 AM] jcheung#0000
as far as unemployment, you can figure out roughly how many are available for you to use by just multiplying the pop count by the unemployment number-doesn't really matter so much on this planet, but does for smaller worlds; IE there's 10k free pioneers available right now (or rather, at next POPR, there's a smaller amount available for instant hire)


[13-Feb-25 02:13 AM] jcheung#0000
open jobs 1424 - change 143 = actual open 1281

[13-Feb-25 02:14 AM] vanarazor#0000
I see less chances to get the favorable population review on some  more competitive worlds


[13-Feb-25 02:15 AM] jcheung#0000
usually pioneers and settlers aren't a major concern


[13-Feb-25 02:15 AM] vanarazor#0000
does make sense, the better conditions, the more attracted the people are subject to get


[13-Feb-25 02:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
there is much larger pool for pionneers than settlers and technician than engineers and scientists


[13-Feb-25 02:17 AM] vanarazor#0000
however no open jobs left for neither of them except scientists


[13-Feb-25 02:17 AM] vanarazor#0000
I can see change on the negative side tho for pioneers and settlers, that means HBs have been demolished on the planet : Phobos?


[13-Feb-25 02:53 AM] evov#0000
More 5k5k Ships available soon. Whenever I get these puppies back to the CX.

[13-Feb-25 10:09 PM] jcheung#0000
look up and left


[13-Feb-25 10:09 PM] jcheung#0000
'planet search'


[13-Feb-25 10:10 PM] jcheung#0000
is it perfect? no. not at all. but it gets you a lot


[13-Feb-25 10:11 PM] vanarazor#0000
ohhh no way DW from  H2O + PG is a 4K higher profit than 15 EXT even with 3 Metallurgist


[13-Feb-25 10:12 PM] jcheung#0000
what about without PG


[13-Feb-25 10:13 PM] vanarazor#0000
20aic less


[13-Feb-25 10:16 PM] vanarazor#0000
but 20 fp uses way less space slot tho


[13-Feb-25 10:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
what would be the strategy for the second base? filling in your material cost of the first one? if the first one 20 FP should I find the closest most producing H20 planet? here i see SE-110C H2O 65%


[13-Feb-25 10:47 PM] vanarazor#0000
does it  sound like a good idea since for that I would  need to build 1CM 8HB1 16RIG (counting that I can use 5 experts + COF and PWO)  for 1,314,796.91 $


[13-Feb-25 10:48 PM] vanarazor#0000
which would negate material cost of planet ROI on 12 days


[13-Feb-25 10:48 PM] vanarazor#0000
not sure how to account for the fuel yet tho


[13-Feb-25 10:49 PM] vanarazor#0000
it does sound like a good idea to me or am I missing something, what do you guys think??


[13-Feb-25 10:57 PM] vanarazor#0000
that's accounting that first bae is using PG for DW


[13-Feb-25 11:30 PM] jcheung#0000
is that ISA?


[13-Feb-25 11:31 PM] jcheung#0000
could be an idea. i'd be worried about being able to ship all that though


[13-Feb-25 11:48 PM] vanarazor#0000
yes it is ISA, and if I am using PG + H2O, I need roughly half the H2O than I would need without PG , then would necessitate a shipment every 2-3 days


[14-Feb-25 05:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Is it worth going for BTS/W? it feels like there is no public market their, only vertical integrations. And a single base would probably already saturate the market in ANT


[14-Feb-25 05:55 AM] realharvey#0000
I run it fully integrated myself


[14-Feb-25 06:06 AM] realharvey#0000
One BTS base can supply about 3 AML bases making W. The BTS base on Aratora costs about 2.5 Mil, an AML Base costs about 10.7 Mil


[14-Feb-25 06:07 AM] realharvey#0000
since you need engineers those AML bases might aswell also run slow for a while because its more diffucult to get pop


[14-Feb-25 06:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
With the new HCB, demand should have increased, tho the market isn‚Äôt really noticing it


[14-Feb-25 06:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I figured that the ones needing it have probably their own production for it


[14-Feb-25 06:10 AM] realharvey#0000
its an interesting new product yes: But ship demand is actually not that high right now. Even with RISE leaving I've not noticed a significant drop in Evo's store


[14-Feb-25 06:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And the new HCBs are really expensive, making them a luxury at the moment


[14-Feb-25 06:12 AM] realharvey#0000
All I want to tell you is: It might be a good opportunity to make money, but it has a high risk and high investment cost


[14-Feb-25 06:13 AM] realharvey#0000
I did take that route, but I have more money that I can burn


[14-Feb-25 06:14 AM] realharvey#0000
I could tear down my aratora base if you want to vertically integrate into Corgi business


[14-Feb-25 06:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Basically, I could support you and an own AML, couldn‚Äôt I? ü§î


[14-Feb-25 06:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I would love to get into that market eventually


[14-Feb-25 06:15 AM] realharvey#0000
hmm do I want to feed a competitor? :D


[14-Feb-25 06:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Tho I would either need a loan or 2-3 weeks, till I have the cash for it


[14-Feb-25 06:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Are you selling the W on market, or using it for other things?


[14-Feb-25 06:16 AM] realharvey#0000
I turn it into WAL


[14-Feb-25 06:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Because I just want to supply the W üòÖüòÇ


[14-Feb-25 06:16 AM] realharvey#0000
and then into HCB


[14-Feb-25 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, it might be a an easy step, but I rather use my permits for more metal production üòâ


[14-Feb-25 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so, not really a competitor, more a supplier

can you explain what is the consequences of "xepiov" being governor of Aceland for a novice like me ?


[14-Feb-25 11:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Xepiov is a player who is notoriously bad at communicating with anyone. As far as I know I‚Äôve only ever seen one message from him ever.


[15-Feb-25 12:01 AM] vanarazor#0000
oh yeah that  for sure  does not help..

I thought that it had something to do with the fact that it was a governor and probably from a different faction/government etc


[15-Feb-25 12:01 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh maybe that too


[15-Feb-25 12:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000

and then from there hope fully understand better  the crafting system and what the neighbor are duying/need


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would caution against it as a second base


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] .urpalhal#0000
ISA is pricy to build on


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] vanarazor#0000
because of the cost to set it up due to harsh conditions ?


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yep


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] .urpalhal#0000
INS is the big kicker there


[15-Feb-25 12:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think as a 3rd or 4th base it could work


[15-Feb-25 12:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But also


[15-Feb-25 12:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôm not the CEO of your company

[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
could I onl see it if I were to build on ISA?


[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yep


[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs based on the temperature


[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So like Halcyon (another planet) is also cold and needs INS


[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
If you start a plan in PrUnPlanner it will show you how much INS you need


[15-Feb-25 12:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it is 10 INS per area used


[15-Feb-25 12:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
where? :

[15-Feb-25 12:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So a full 500 area base would be 5000 INS


[15-Feb-25 12:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000
In the constitution cart


[15-Feb-25 12:10 AM] vanarazor#0000
oh yep gotcha


[15-Feb-25 12:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh and HSE is 1 per building


[15-Feb-25 12:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
And each HSE is like 20k/u


[15-Feb-25 12:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
Jesus..


[15-Feb-25 12:12 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So between the HSE and INS you need like 1.5 million AIC for the full base


[15-Feb-25 12:13 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So like I mean no one is stopping you if that is really what you want to do next


[15-Feb-25 12:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh another useful bit in PrUnplanner is in the overview rectangle (idk what else to call it) section?


[15-Feb-25 12:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[15-Feb-25 12:18 AM] jcheung#0000
half that


[15-Feb-25 12:18 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs cheaper than 20k per unit? Which one am I think of?


[15-Feb-25 12:18 AM] jcheung#0000
the 6 month high was 13.5k

Idk :RSZeroShrugIDK:  I‚Äôm a year in and I still don‚Äôt know


[15-Feb-25 12:19 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But H2O would be a good one to do


[15-Feb-25 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
shipping intensive, but probably good


[15-Feb-25 12:21 AM] vanarazor#0000
so probably best udea to get a bigger ship first ay


[15-Feb-25 12:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean my 5th base was a triple permit (so 1000 area) base on Halcyon producing ~800 HAL (salt) a day and I only had two upgraded starter ships


[15-Feb-25 12:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
And basically those ships can only fit 1000 HAL

Yeah


[15-Feb-25 12:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000
More bases

generally tall only works for newbies and people who are burnt out

something to keep in mind for anyone struggling with the shipping for an ISA base, Zipatsu almost always has BUY LM Ads up on ISA for slightly lower than market rates


[15-Feb-25 10:03 AM] tanda#0000
you can dump into their ads and they'll just use it to anchor the water market

I've seen that I think on one of the local mqarket nearby


[15-Feb-25 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
i forgot, i have 300 mtp at ant


[15-Feb-25 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
what's up


[15-Feb-25 02:31 PM] vanarazor#0000
ow..


[15-Feb-25 02:32 PM] vanarazor#0000
well I'm keen to buy your stock if price is good enough, but for now I ll have to wait  a couple of days to see batches of DW amd MEA being produced and sold


[15-Feb-25 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
well


[15-Feb-25 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
the price of MTP just spiked way up like i thought it would >.>


[15-Feb-25 02:34 PM] vanarazor#0000
I already bought enough  for 2 days of production and last batches of DW are being produced as we speak.. so probably in48-72h I ll be buying your MTP, Im not sure how contract forms work yet but I could see a contract split into 60 MTP at the time


[15-Feb-25 02:35 PM] vanarazor#0000
MEA is almost 170 % more profitable than DW at the moment


[15-Feb-25 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000
MEA prices appear to be slowly settling in to a higher bracket for now


[15-Feb-25 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000
MEA is rough for newbies because of the high feedstock costs


[15-Feb-25 02:36 PM] laaxus#0000
you're not accounting for the capital you have to put into input goods


[15-Feb-25 02:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah.. but luckily enough I've got a grant approved and found a free interest loan as well, 20 FP are ready to produce , few batches of DWdone


[15-Feb-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
even if the recipe is more profitable
I'm not sure the return on investment is higher


[15-Feb-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
that's something you have to calculate yourself


[15-Feb-25 02:37 PM] jcheung#0000
the ROI is higher


[15-Feb-25 02:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
well on prplnner it says it is .. _worried sigh_


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] laaxus#0000
prunplanner roi doesn't take into account the stock


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
the profit margins on MEA are a bit larger, at least until FIM and MTP prices catch up


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
which MTP is going


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
_looks at HRT MTP prices_


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
fortunately with FPs they have options


[15-Feb-25 02:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
but HRT is far crom ANT isn;t ?


[15-Feb-25 02:39 PM] jcheung#0000
yes but with that kind of price delta, it's not uncommon to buy and ship in from farther away


[15-Feb-25 02:39 PM] jcheung#0000
it's currently 1.8k more to buy at HRT than ANT


[15-Feb-25 02:40 PM] jcheung#0000
so once MOR is out of MTP, ANT will probably be next

[15-Feb-25 02:40 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm so glad i decided to bite the bullet and sacrifice some production to make MTP myself


[15-Feb-25 02:40 PM] laaxus#0000
if you do round trip every 5 days you need to compare :
- DW : Profit / Base + 5 days of consummables + 5 days of H2O
- MEA : Profit / Base + days of consummables + 5 days of fim + 5 days of MTP

And FIM MTP are very expensive

MEA might have a higher roi, just do the math
Just don't believe it has a higher return on investment just because it has sa higher profit

i should really run some of my MTP out to HRT >.>


[15-Feb-25 02:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
only 31 bid MTP on IC1


[15-Feb-25 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000

[15-Feb-25 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000

(sorry to be pedantic but it's important)


[15-Feb-25 02:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
I need the money sooner I send cargo to CX daiily but DW is so much cargo compared to FIM and MTP


[15-Feb-25 02:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
well hey dices are tossed anyway for the next 3 days


[15-Feb-25 02:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I don't think you understand how expensive FIM and MTP is


[15-Feb-25 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
they do


[15-Feb-25 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
they're only cutting their production with MEA not focusing it

it's just that I notice H20prices going up already and profit on the lower trend


[15-Feb-25 02:46 PM] vanarazor#0000
so I've looked up on prplaner and noticed higher returns for MEA, checked the prices and for now there is porofit to be made but not sure how long it is going to last


[15-Feb-25 02:46 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not there to decide what you *should* do
I'm just trying to put things into perspective, so that you make a choice you won't regret


[15-Feb-25 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, dw has been trending down slowly


[15-Feb-25 02:47 PM] jcheung#0000
at current MTP prices, profit might be a bit rough

[15-Feb-25 02:51 PM] jcheung#0000
any not instantly hired is pulled out of the unemployed pool on POPR

if no unemployed, then it starts taking pop out of people's bases at POPR and leaves open jobs

with LHP and just a normal (reasonable) build FSE is fine. I'm just dumb, lol

I do find that the FTL slider doesn't really do much though. Perhaps the FTL reactor could be the limiting factor given the volume of the ship.

on phobos the MCG is 23% more electronics? or is it the COCG ? means that my DW production is not located at the right location? what are electronics for ? do they sell well ? that was more than one question


[18-Feb-25 12:15 AM] tanda#0000
Cogc is what's in question here, on phobos that is Electronics. Your DW production is fine for now. Electronics are mostly used for things like shipbuilding and other advanced industries. They don't sell insanely well, with a couple exceptions

I've pretty much always got stock. But I see Archiel has hooked you up anyway. I think the OOG ships end up being about 200k cheaper, but 100k of that is due to a smaller FTL tank ( I prefer the large ones ). In the scheme of things, very similar ship, very similar price. Shout out if you need more ( LCB/HCB/VCB/WCB all in stock )


[18-Feb-25 12:35 AM] vanarazor#0000
cheers


[18-Feb-25 12:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think they‚Äôre both the same size? Bc I used the same blueprint for the ship I got from you and the one I got from OOG


[18-Feb-25 12:39 AM] evov#0000
Possibly? I know in the past the standard oog ship used medium FTL fuel tanks, and I prefer large. But that may have changed.


[18-Feb-25 12:41 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I think they‚Äôre large FTL medium STL

[18-Feb-25 02:13 AM] tanda#0000
the good news with MEA is that allocater has some fat buy orders sitting on that market

if you get too much MEA, you can dump some into his buy and get some solvency back

[18-Feb-25 02:13 AM] vanarazor#0000
i ll stack up 100 Mea and see how long it takes


[18-Feb-25 02:14 AM] laaxus#0000
Just look at chart


[18-Feb-25 02:14 AM] laaxus#0000
And see how many sales there are per week


[18-Feb-25 02:15 AM] vanarazor#0000
not many


[18-Feb-25 02:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Then it's called illiquid


[18-Feb-25 02:15 AM] laaxus#0000
And it's recommended to enter such markets only if the bid order is high enough to allow for profit in the worst case


[18-Feb-25 02:16 AM] laaxus#0000
Hence why you should use buy at buy, sell at sell CX settings in PrunPlanner


[18-Feb-25 02:53 AM] vanarazor#0000
jvaler advised me to use the pp7 universe . but I switch in between Cx settings, also will try to hoard a little bit and not sell directly at buy or at well which reduces greatly profit


[18-Feb-25 02:53 AM] vanarazor#0000
for now DW has been more profitable than MEA but I've got  lucky to grab FIM and MTP at reduced cost so even the sell now option would be profit


[18-Feb-25 03:04 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't recommend using pp7 universe


[18-Feb-25 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
you'll always be 1 week behind everybody else


[18-Feb-25 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
furthermore, what's the point of using the universe average


[18-Feb-25 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
if you're only selling at antares cx ?


[18-Feb-25 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
might as well just use antares values


[18-Feb-25 03:06 AM] laaxus#0000
furthermore, average is not representative of potential profit YOU could make


[18-Feb-25 03:06 AM] laaxus#0000
buy at buy, sell at sell, gives you the current floor of profit a recipe make


[18-Feb-25 03:07 AM] laaxus#0000
this is the setting I recommend to every player starting


[18-Feb-25 03:07 AM] laaxus#0000
even now, 220M of equity later, I still use it


[18-Feb-25 03:07 AM] laaxus#0000
PP7 is not *bad* per se


[18-Feb-25 03:07 AM] laaxus#0000
but don't be surprised if you do less profit than what it shows


[18-Feb-25 03:24 AM] vanarazor#0000
you've made multiple valid points!! PP7 is unvalid to be used in my position Hence why I still switch between Cx settings


[18-Feb-25 03:24 AM] vanarazor#0000
But I think I've got _your points_


[18-Feb-25 10:06 AM] marat_sh#0000
Damn, already? üòÖ Speedrun to 1 billion when?


[18-Feb-25 10:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
I also use Buy at Ask and Sell at Bid even if I only sell at Ask. It just shows bare minimum you can make, but in reality it‚Äôs more than that

My ISA base is working very well to produce all my water consumption except for like 200 per day, which should be getting covered in the coming days


[19-Feb-25 12:45 PM] realharvey#0000
Rat is a daily cost of 7k, its about 4k more than before, but 4k on a 100k profit per day base is.. a rounding error

It is just hard for newer players who aren‚Äôt in RATs


[19-Feb-25 12:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it‚Äôd be sad if Bfabs and RAT eventually get so unprofitable that basically nobody makes them and predominantly buys from MMs instead


[19-Feb-25 12:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or at least less profitable relative to everything else you can do


[19-Feb-25 12:52 PM] manhim#0000
Maybe rising the MM would entice more people to produce it üòõ


[19-Feb-25 12:52 PM] realharvey#0000
I actually like that those things can be left alone without any issue to make it easier to go for more advanced products


[19-Feb-25 12:52 PM] realharvey#0000
if they wouldnt exist or the MM would be way more expensive, we would have to scale down higher tier industries when the playercount lowers


[19-Feb-25 12:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
I personally think that would be great, but that‚Äôs just because I think volatility is fun üòÑ


[19-Feb-25 12:54 PM] realharvey#0000
it could lead to make earlygame be unplayable


[19-Feb-25 12:54 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, the number of common products that seemed pinned to their market maker seems like a design problem in the game somewhere.  (Lots of possible theories as to what it is).

But, this is different from saying the existence of market makers is inherently bad, since... you could get a marketwide deadlock otherwise.


[19-Feb-25 12:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think the design problem is just that money in from IDC/EDC is so much larger than money out from any other source

It does have the effect of removing currency from circulation


[19-Feb-25 12:55 PM] realharvey#0000
agreed


[19-Feb-25 12:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
So at some point currency inflates enough that the money-out faucets from all the lower level MMs turn on


[19-Feb-25 12:56 PM] realharvey#0000
the universe needs a government that can influence MM prices :D


[19-Feb-25 12:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it would eventually come to an equilibrium if data core production could become unprofitable with rising input prices, but the MMs kinda put a ceiling on the cost to make everything (or at least on certain input costs)


[19-Feb-25 12:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
And tbh I haven‚Äôt done the math to see if they do ever become unprofitable

when I look at the economy reports from Prun the Money in circulation appears to be very stable. How is that we are still feeling inflation?

My statement is entirely based on vibes üòÑ


[19-Feb-25 01:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
But I guess my feeling is that because a lot of those lower level items like bfabs and rats / dw are spending so much time near the MMs, but not equaling the amount of money entering the economy from data cores, we must still be experiencing inflation in some form


[19-Feb-25 01:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
But who knows? I‚Äôm not a Prun economist


[19-Feb-25 01:11 PM] realharvey#0000
I personally believe that the playerbase is overall getting "older" and moving from T1 to T2 and T3 production and we dont have that big of an influx of newbros


[19-Feb-25 01:12 PM] realharvey#0000
I've noticed quite a bit more movement on the CX on higher tier items which have been mostly fully intergrated before

It's a fairly steady 7.2% growth each month


[19-Feb-25 01:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I _think_ the player count is actually down a bit, so cash per player is probably up more than that.


[19-Feb-25 01:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Likewise cash per unit production. there are some charts for that too but it's a lot more work

it's not a matter of fate, just a matter of time


[19-Feb-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
For newer months, we have the MM balance total, so we can see income via MM without the drips from people quitting. In Nov we probably lost ~500m in quits. (which does take it out of the supply, so that's good to know, but it's interesting to know how/why)


[19-Feb-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000

I've thought about that a lot. I'm not sure if we want to. If we want to devalue a currency, we should devalue NCC. (maybe?).


[19-Feb-25 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
money printers works but it's evil
What we need to do is invest in new players


[19-Feb-25 01:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
So convert your AIC to NCC then spend the NCC on bfabs and other stuff stuck at the MM.


[19-Feb-25 01:37 PM] realharvey#0000
which is what ADI is doing


[19-Feb-25 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000

Antares needs another starting planet. New players don't know how great antares is, so they pick a starting planet at random. There are fewer starting planets in ANT.


[19-Feb-25 01:38 PM] laaxus#0000
stage 2 grant should be part of a cult project

"Lowering profit margins" as a reason is very different from "I want cheaper materials".

400/u or there about


[20-Feb-25 01:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
to make a full 5 expert Deimos base make 50k profit, AL needs to be sold for roughly 880

what would be the profit at 900 ?


[20-Feb-25 01:28 AM] laaxus#0000
this is roughly other cx prices

[20-Feb-25 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
everybody deserve a fair price


[20-Feb-25 01:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
FLX has risen over 30% in price in the last few weeks


[20-Feb-25 01:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
O is more expensive since this year


[20-Feb-25 01:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and your profit is obliviously a bit higher, when you produce your own ALO


[20-Feb-25 01:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
also, basic consumables (DW, RAT, COF) have also risen in price


[20-Feb-25 01:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
which affect lower tier productions often more, then higher ones


[20-Feb-25 01:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
if somebody has 5.5 mil they don't need - you could buy up AL up to jvalers order and "correct" the price up to 890 AIC
-# not financial advice


[20-Feb-25 01:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
tho I feel like people will start to ask lower

I have a sheet to calculate the "ideal" metal prices


[20-Feb-25 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it bascially tries to provide 50k profit for a EXT base - that's the ore price, and then achieve 50k profit for the corresponding SME base


[20-Feb-25 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the "ideal" ALO price would be around 107 - which is half of what the market currently offers. Lowering the "ideal" AL price down to 760


[20-Feb-25 01:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so, it's currently mandatory to produce your own ALO for AL, but the market prices is more or less fine, I guess


[20-Feb-25 01:44 AM] laaxus#0000
high rat and dw price is the root of all evil


[20-Feb-25 02:14 AM] zillatron#0000
it's more or less back to what it was before whoever it was inflated the price a little while ago, 180-200/u was pretty normal


[20-Feb-25 02:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I did something


[20-Feb-25 02:19 AM] zillatron#0000
I agree that it's actually pretty good atm, 500 ish days ago when i started (Deimos) 600/u was tight but still profitable for a noob with 1 base

- Salary is 50k/d
- I'm paying for the base and the consumables
- Have no shipping to do whatsoever, only work is to send me the cont to give me your production

[22-Feb-25 04:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Why am I doing that ? I believe that HAL price could get as  low as 250 at halcyon / 280 at ANT CX


[22-Feb-25 04:31 AM] laaxus#0000
and ultimately, through CL base, EPO price could get lower from 170 to 150


[22-Feb-25 04:32 AM] laaxus#0000
which would allow RFabs price to get even lower


[22-Feb-25 04:32 AM] laaxus#0000
but I have to start from HAL


[22-Feb-25 10:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I had it pinned at 250 at ant for a while


[22-Feb-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
My goal is to pin at 280 at ant at first


[22-Feb-25 10:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But uh some one bought too much


[22-Feb-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
then selling at 250 at Halcyon local Market


[22-Feb-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, Hal extraction shouldn't be that profitable


[22-Feb-25 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I wonder if one base would be enough to pin it at 280


[22-Feb-25 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I might need two


[22-Feb-25 10:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean it is hard to move around


[22-Feb-25 10:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But yeah I agree


[22-Feb-25 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000
My plan is to abuse darkfuel


[22-Feb-25 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000

[22-Feb-25 10:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Ahh


[22-Feb-25 10:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Gotcha


[22-Feb-25 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000
well guess I'll take another loan for a WCB


[22-Feb-25 10:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I can try to lower the price of HAL again


[22-Feb-25 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
as long as you're producing, it's good enough


[22-Feb-25 10:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I don‚Äôt use any of my HAL


[22-Feb-25 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't ... sell it ?


[22-Feb-25 10:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I do sell it


[22-Feb-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
then you're filling demand


[22-Feb-25 10:32 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I could fill more demand


[22-Feb-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
that demand won't disappear just because you sell your production to the cx


[22-Feb-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
as long as you sell your production and you're producing full time, then I believe it's good enough, but you do you


[22-Feb-25 10:33 AM] tanda#0000
dang that was quick, and here's me looking for a similar person for a week now


[22-Feb-25 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000

Looking for a newer player willing to run a permit on SE-110a for me for 50k per day. I will handle all shipping and supply of the base, you just trade me back the CLI and DW you produce. 
- I pay for everything. Base setup, workforce consumables, input goods, even your HQ upgrade if you need it.
- You'll receive a month's worth of consumables at a time, and a weekly supply of water.
- Pickups for CLI and DW will be weekly to reduce contract spam for the both of us.
- Repair mats will be supplied every 60 days.
- Yes, I do need the experts set up like on the plan as you generate experts from base operation
@ me if you want to discuss further.

This is why I am not crying too hard about my impending termination from the Water Board.


[22-Feb-25 07:49 PM] potaterror#0000
Anybody got a real schmick Google sheets empire management doc that handles inventory & price import from FIO that they don't mind letting me copy and crib off of? I lack the skills to roll one from scratch, and the time to sink into developing them properly.


[22-Feb-25 08:14 PM] jcheung#0000
what precisely do you mean


[22-Feb-25 09:29 PM] potaterror#0000
Basically just one that pulls inventory from FIO and breaks it out in a useful way for incorporating into a management sheet. The API output as a CSV is beyond me to integrate in a meaningful way, such as putting the values into the appropriate columns of an otherwise static row-wise layout of all commodities. 

I figured some folks are likely doing roughly the same, or at least close enough to clue me in on a good way to go about it.


[22-Feb-25 09:41 PM] jab.sh#0000
pulling inventory and displaying it is pretty easy, I can help you out with that if you want


[22-Feb-25 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have an example of a management sheet


[22-Feb-25 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000
could be pretty easy


[22-Feb-25 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000
xlookup() does a lot of heavy lifting and is pretty simple


[22-Feb-25 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000
filter() also is very useful too


[22-Feb-25 11:38 PM] potaterror#0000
Only thing I've got is entirely offline, bit hard to facilitate.


[22-Feb-25 11:40 PM] jcheung#0000
uploading to google drive is pretty easy


[22-Feb-25 11:40 PM] potaterror#0000
Sure, I'd appreciate it. Mostly just need a working example and I can probably reverse it from there.


[22-Feb-25 11:40 PM] potaterror#0000
Eh, true.


[22-Feb-25 11:41 PM] potaterror#0000
Doesn't support the integration I'm looking for, but if you're just curious what I'm after in terms of format and such I guess it'd do.


[22-Feb-25 11:41 PM] jcheung#0000
what integration are you looking for though


[22-Feb-25 11:42 PM] jcheung#0000
you're not going to be able to easily make API calls from excel afaik


[22-Feb-25 11:42 PM] potaterror#0000
Pulling inventory (and eventually market) information from FIO.


[22-Feb-25 11:43 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, that's part of why I'm just scrubbing it and going to sheets.


[22-Feb-25 11:44 PM] jcheung#0000
looks like you can use scripts to call APIs in excel


[22-Feb-25 11:58 PM] tanda#0000
easiest way to access FIO from excel is doing imports to raw data tables, then pivot tables


[23-Feb-25 12:10 AM] potaterror#0000
No clue on how to do that from scratch, haven't fooled around with pivot tables at all.


[23-Feb-25 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
you mean like manual imports?

[23-Feb-25 12:47 AM] potaterror#0000
That might handle the pulling, but the formatting in a useful way eludes me since it's just CSV dumps only containing items with non-zero stocks in the various inventories, and I've got no idea how to fit that into a full list of commodities.


[23-Feb-25 12:53 AM] tanda#0000
pivot table


[23-Feb-25 12:59 AM] jcheung#0000
define `fit that into a full list of commodities`

[23-Feb-25 01:07 AM] jcheung#0000
> imports to raw data tables
is this automatic or manual


[23-Feb-25 01:07 AM] tanda#0000
manual, it updates whenever I tell it to refresh


[23-Feb-25 02:11 AM] potaterror#0000
Literally just a full list of commodities, one per column, is how I've been doing it. My stumbling block is importing the data and sorting it appropriately since the API doesn't pass items without values, and I lack the know-how to account for that.

formulas in b3, c1, c2, c3 but doesn't strictly need MAP() and the formula can be dragged along instead


[23-Feb-25 04:00 AM] jcheung#0000
(i'm sure there's more efficient ways to do this, but it's the closest i could make it quickly [20 minutes])


[23-Feb-25 04:36 AM] potaterror#0000
Yep, exactly what I was after.


[23-Feb-25 04:37 AM] potaterror#0000
I should be able to finagle this into doing what I want now that I've got it as a reference.


[23-Feb-25 04:37 AM] potaterror#0000
Thanks!


[23-Feb-25 04:48 AM] jcheung#0000
The location list can also be pulled with unique() as well, but it needs some additional finagling to do base+war properly


[23-Feb-25 04:51 AM] potaterror#0000
I'll pull it apart and figure out how it works as I have more time, but if I can't figure out how to make it play nicely I may ping you about it.


[23-Feb-25 04:52 AM] potaterror#0000
Gives me what I need to read up on, that's a big chunk of things. Thanks again.


[23-Feb-25 05:17 AM] evov#0000
I play the steam version of the game without any extensions/addons/fio support etc.

I get CX price data from the prices csv that can be imported into a spreadsheet.
I get warehouse data by copy/pasting into a sheet.
Some things like building costs and production formulas are manually entered.
Everything else is basically just manipulating data in a spreadsheet to get the information I'm interested in.


[23-Feb-25 05:21 AM] evov#0000
I think the important thing is really just working out what questions are worth answering. What level of precision / detail makes a meaningful impact.


[23-Feb-25 05:30 AM] potaterror#0000
I don't really feel the need to work out things to the point of building costs or production chains in a spreadsheet, I'm pretty content with PrunPlanner for that. It doesn't work so great for keeping track of stockpile thresholds or material buffers though, especially not with the way I've got my logistics set up.


[23-Feb-25 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
my logistic setup is just stockpiling 45 days worth of supplies


[23-Feb-25 05:38 AM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, I've got ~60 days on most bases, but it's sort of an extended star topology, so there's a degree of cascade from HRT as my primary depot down to some outliers that in turn resupply individual bases.


[23-Feb-25 05:39 AM] potaterror#0000
Figuring out the reserve and keeping those intermediaries at a good level is what PrunPlanner really doesn't do at all.


[23-Feb-25 12:25 PM] tanda#0000
Did I miss something? Why did I just sell 2 months of volume in a day on REA?

PSL PSM PSS are underproduced and therefore have a high price

[24-Feb-25 03:23 PM] eminence32#0000
but prunplanners "profit" calculator assumes that you sell everything.  if you end up consuming it youself, the profit number isn't the whole picture


[24-Feb-25 03:23 PM] jvaler#0000
oh 3 permits lol


[24-Feb-25 03:23 PM] jvaler#0000
not really comparable i guess

it is the same picture

The rest of the bases include a couple H bases (4 permits in total), again, seeing a lot more than  70k a day


[24-Feb-25 03:23 PM] laaxus#0000
because you're buying at ask


[24-Feb-25 03:23 PM] laaxus#0000
There's no difference between consuming your production


[24-Feb-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
and selling at ask, then buying at ask

Yes, after rational thought i did realise that


[24-Feb-25 03:24 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
But at first i was like "thats....so low"


[24-Feb-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
internal consumption means you're selling at ask price, at no risk (hence why it is so strong)


[24-Feb-25 03:25 PM] laaxus#0000
that's why one should think in term of roi

[24-Feb-25 03:25 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[24-Feb-25 03:26 PM] eminence32#0000
prunplanner is assuming that you can sell at bids prices.   but when i plan my own bases, i assume that i have to buy at ask prices, which can be a lot higher


[24-Feb-25 03:26 PM] laaxus#0000
you can litteraly do that in prunplanner ?


[24-Feb-25 03:26 PM] laaxus#0000

[24-Feb-25 04:37 PM] jcheung#0000
It's also why it's suggested to only use those numbers as a guideline rather than a hard rule


[24-Feb-25 04:39 PM] potaterror#0000
DW/FIM/MTP. Realistically the only market output is MTP. That's HRT prices though, so I could pretty easily skew it further for funsies.


[24-Feb-25 04:41 PM] potaterror#0000
Oh yeah. If I try I can bump that down to like 4 days. Hah.


[24-Feb-25 04:43 PM] potaterror#0000
I guess I could put some effort in and see how close it actually is. Probably well under, but it's very stable production.

Oh just that the value of the products to me is higher than the cx price. I have a big mix of products there and probably the PSH drags down the average output.

i think the real question here is... will the SC market go back down, or will it continue to go up


[25-Feb-25 08:20 PM] tanda#0000
It'll go back down, price disparity between the markets is sizeable now. We should see people trying to make a quick buck by shipping between CXs


[25-Feb-25 08:20 PM] tanda#0000

I was gonna drop an HE base a few weeks back but then I saw that Canadian Tire and Mental home just dropped new bases on Aeolus and Archiel was there just a few weeks before that. So figured the market will trend back down soon enough


[26-Feb-25 06:26 PM] tanda#0000
I only dropped that bass simply because there's no guarantee. Anybody's going to be actually selling it on the market and I need 90 a day.

what i'm basing this on is the fact that bids are rising

which means that if this continues, in about a month the bids will punch through the current asks

@evov Whats your pricing on the 5k/5k right now?


[28-Feb-25 04:33 PM] evov#0000
Realistically, they should be 11mil. But. . . . someone who really really really likes WAL has been paying high prices for that on the CX for it, so I've kept my price at 15mil until WAL / W price gets back to normal. It's just more profitable for me to sell the WAL I make to those CX orders than it is to turn it into ships.

I can't wait to have enough money to make provisions for weeks, I can't imagine having many bases to constantly having to provide consumables. I've seen XIT action package and I was wondering if anyone had tips about it's usage.

I feel like I'd use it with a bigger shipping power to re-supply monthly consumables stock.. but I can see it being used for smaller stock as well..


[02-Mar-25 11:52 PM] tanda#0000
Most of us beyond a certain point run 30+ day consumable buffers, with lower for production inputs

mainly from CX warehouse like ANT? because prices on the CX are higher than internal offers?


[02-Mar-25 11:56 PM] tanda#0000
the CX is a good spot to center your empire around for most of us, largely because the storage has no practical upper limit and also because it makes easy to sell stuff

just so people know, a combination of school and being tired of chore simulator has had me not really play the game for a week. i probably still won't for some time, idrk. a lot of my bases are out of inputs, so production has kinda stopped. also ping me if you send a contract

> I personally don't use action packages...just lazy about setting them up though, so I'm not going to say they're bad

Unless I misunderstand their use, I'm actually surprised that action packages haven't drawn developer backlash due to the APEX guidelines (https://prosperousuniverse.com/account/guidelines).  But then, so are many of the tools that they seem to be fine with (e.g. FIO), so what do I know....

> Do not use external tools for the automatic retrieval of data from the game world *or to automate actions in the game world*.

[Most of the rest of Refined PrUN doesn't seem to necessarily run afoul of this though]


[03-Mar-25 06:02 AM] laaxus#0000
action package follow guidelines


[03-Mar-25 06:02 AM] laaxus#0000
it would break guidelines if it opened/closed the windows for you


[03-Mar-25 06:02 AM] realharvey#0000
those action packages have been developed in close communication with the devs


[03-Mar-25 06:03 AM] laaxus#0000

[03-Mar-25 06:04 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Especially the bits that are basically just literal bugfixes (case sensitivity on material names in some, but not all, contexts)


[03-Mar-25 06:08 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
hmm, I guess I misunderstand what they do then, since it looked like you could take json out of another tool and paste it into the actions to do things like buy exact amounts of many materials at the same time, which _sounds_ like automation to me vs the number of clicks otherwise involved.

But I freely admit I haven't tried it, since the description in rprun is "automate certain tasks" and that's so similar to the phrasing of the guidelines "automate actions in the game world", I didn't want to risk anything.

Though, again, its clear the devs aren't banning everyone using rprun and are very aware of it, so ü§∑ ...


[03-Mar-25 06:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
@razenpok could probably explain in detail how it works, but as far as I understand it, it simulates the player doing those stuff - so it clicks the game UI, inputs the amount you want to buy, and creates and order. 
The guidelines are probably referring to bots or hijacking game-endpoints to automate tasks without player interaction. 
The rPrun actions are still player activated


[03-Mar-25 08:46 AM] jcheung#0000
It moves the button that requires your interaction to send server contact, so there's no automation


[03-Mar-25 08:47 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
oh, so you still have to click once for each order then?


[03-Mar-25 08:47 AM] jcheung#0000

[04-Mar-25 12:29 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm probably just bad, but... are there tricks to using the contracts interface that aren't obvious?

For example, I can't seem to edit a condition (saving doesn't ever work when I edit the condition).  Likewise, I constantly find myself forgetting something like the destination, or having a product type not save properly after I type it in, which combined with being unable to edit means I have to reset the entire template.


[04-Mar-25 12:30 PM] laaxus#0000
you can't edit conditions anymore since the multi item contracts


[04-Mar-25 12:30 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
oh, of course.  üòø


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] laaxus#0000
and yes, you have to redo the entire contract when you do a mistake


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] laaxus#0000
no, there's no QoL to this


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] laaxus#0000

[04-Mar-25 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000
My theory is that the game was too good and therefore destiny forced the devs to make very bad QoL to balance the equation of the matrix


[04-Mar-25 12:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sometimes you have to change the quantity field in order to change a contract, even if you want it to stay the same (change it, then change it back). Otherwise it won't save. Not sure if that's what you're seeing.


[04-Mar-25 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
But with templated multi item contracts you can't edit the number of entries. I have no problems changing quantities or material items in them, however.


[04-Mar-25 12:53 PM] razenpok#0000
wdym "you can't edit conditions"?


[04-Mar-25 12:54 PM] laaxus#0000

[04-Mar-25 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
If you're editing something with an amount, put a 0 in front of the amount when you want to... say, change the location

{Reactions}
ü§Ø 

[04-Mar-25 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
It will not allow you to edit unless the amount changes. Old bug.


[04-Mar-25 01:12 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
feels like a bug that rprun should have fixed for them üôÇ  (like material case sensitivity)


[04-Mar-25 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh, hey, i shoulda scrolled down. 2 other people said the same thing


[04-Mar-25 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't know if it's something he *can* fix


[04-Mar-25 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Or rather, is allowed to


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Well, i guess he could just insert a 0 in front of every number


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I mean, he can clearly edit user input.


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
exactly


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
(and, possibly even remove it again)


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Hey @razenpok how feasible would it be to chuck a 0 in front of every amount field when you go to edit conditions


[04-Mar-25 01:17 PM] razenpok#0000
For some reason, the bug is still there if I do that

This, here, is like a magical experience.


[04-Mar-25 01:25 PM] razenpok#0000
The bug under the hood is: prun always tries to interact with the "amount" as if it is a string, but it starts out as a number and only becomes a string if it was edited


[04-Mar-25 01:25 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Amazing.


[04-Mar-25 01:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So you can fix that with RPrun?

[04-Mar-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Heh. You know, I've run into that issue a few times, but i gotta say that this not being fixed by prun for so long impresses me


[04-Mar-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Mostly because you found it relatively quickly


[04-Mar-25 01:36 PM] razenpok#0000
While some bugfixes and QoL improvements should definitely be a part of the base game, I think it's better that rprun is a separate entity - it gives some freedom with experimentation so we can try new things with less fear of breaking something in the process


[04-Mar-25 01:37 PM] razenpok#0000
Well, I found the issue in the minified js code, but idk how it got triggered in the actual source code


[04-Mar-25 01:37 PM] razenpok#0000
Maybe it's a non-trivial issue, or an issue in a 3rd party library


[04-Mar-25 01:39 PM] jcheung#0000
I faintly recall hearing this bug was added in language update? Or was it political stuff


[04-Mar-25 01:40 PM] jcheung#0000
Wonder what had to change for this to become a string instead of number like original


[04-Mar-25 01:41 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I dunno, I feel integrating at least clear bugfixes, especially when identified for long periods of time, woudl be strictly better for everyone  (e.g. this, as well as case sensitivity of certain commands).

{Reactions}
true (2) 

[04-Mar-25 01:41 PM] razenpok#0000
Maybe some refactoring or smth


[04-Mar-25 01:41 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm not surprised this bug exists, only that it persisted.


[04-Mar-25 01:41 PM] .shiva.#0000
the game basically has 1 dev

{Reactions}
This (2) 

[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
1 dev, part time


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] .shiva.#0000
and tbh I'm not totally sure they're full time?


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
so yeah


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
FWIW, fixing the case sensitivity thing would, minute for minute of dev work, have a bigger impact on my play than gateways or gifting of pro.  (pre-rprun, anyway)


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] razenpok#0000
I think molp works full time on it


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
that's why I wished we could participate


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] razenpok#0000
It's the game designer that works part time


[04-Mar-25 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
let us bugfix, at least


[04-Mar-25 01:44 PM] .shiva.#0000
*really*? yeah idk, maybe their backend is more complicated than I think it is, but either way pace is... slow


[04-Mar-25 01:45 PM] razenpok#0000
I agree that pace could be better, but I also don't know how his work day looks like

(shit, wrong message to reply)


[04-Mar-25 01:45 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I have no problem with the pace for larger features, I just can't imagine that fixing the case sensitivity is more than a line or two to actually fix.  (whatever that expands to in dev time given testing and release)


[04-Mar-25 01:45 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
oh, lol


[04-Mar-25 01:45 PM] razenpok#0000
Yeah, I was answering lelisa lol


[04-Mar-25 01:46 PM] realharvey#0000
razenpok Prun dev when?


[04-Mar-25 01:46 PM] razenpok#0000
It could be that there's a lot of work on backend, frontend, maybe some meetings or something, maybe he's depressed idk


[04-Mar-25 01:46 PM] laaxus#0000
I just wish we could participate and develop QoL and bugfix for the game we love


[04-Mar-25 01:47 PM] .shiva.#0000
gateways are going to have been the majority of a year to implement, hopefully with the infra in palce we could get some other structures a bit quicker, but I dont think any are on the roadmap as being "near-term"


[04-Mar-25 01:48 PM] razenpok#0000
I wish frontend was in an open-source repo so we could make pull requests with bug fixes

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Mar-25 01:48 PM] razenpok#0000
Yeah, I also hope that they are laying the groundwork to make other infra projects faster


[04-Mar-25 01:49 PM] .shiva.#0000
looking at it again, Space Elevators -> Space Stations are on the list now


[04-Mar-25 01:49 PM] razenpok#0000
It's not about fixing case sensitivity, it's the fact that there are a lot of qol issues and bugs, and fixing one of them won't make other disappear


[04-Mar-25 01:50 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I guess I've just really only noticed the two trivial ones then.


[04-Mar-25 01:50 PM] razenpok#0000

[04-Mar-25 01:50 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Multi-item contracts is a QoL feature, but its more than a trivial fix.


[04-Mar-25 01:51 PM] .shiva.#0000
tbh I'd kinda guess it was fairly trivial


[04-Mar-25 01:51 PM] razenpok#0000
rprun has 83 features as of now, so it's quite some amount of work to implement

good to know, didn't see them earlier


[05-Mar-25 11:00 PM] maxim.bryuzgin#0000
I want to offer a variety, that probably will expand as we go. Though to start we'll probably be indirectly helping by producing parts for ship building and selling them to ship builders.

[05-Mar-25 11:07 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, it takes a lot of bases to build a ship, depending on how much you buy from the CX of course


[05-Mar-25 11:10 PM] maxim.bryuzgin#0000
the more we can cut down on intermediates, the cheaper we can make our ships

getting back to business, to figure out what intermediates we need, we also need to know the final product. Therefore ship blueprints.

But what if I make real, actual, not data core electronics there? üò≠


[06-Mar-25 07:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
Honestly I think it‚Äôd be nice to convert a lot of the fertile planets to agriculture, but there‚Äôs so many established bases to work against


[06-Mar-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
We have 1 (ONE) electronic planet in antares


[06-Mar-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok


[06-Mar-25 07:57 AM] jcheung#0000
Rise was building up another


[06-Mar-25 07:57 AM] jcheung#0000
It's probably dying now though


[06-Mar-25 08:00 AM] tanda#0000
We have like 3, i think


[06-Mar-25 08:00 AM] realharvey#0000
I know of Phobos an EOS


[06-Mar-25 08:00 AM] realharvey#0000
we dont really need more fertile agri

Do it. Join the dark side, like my campaign to turn Promitor into a HAL mine.


[06-Mar-25 12:08 PM] realharvey#0000
wait what


[06-Mar-25 12:10 PM] potaterror#0000
It's a bit of an in joke. Mine HAL on Promitor, ship it to Boucher, extract the water there and process with PG to make DW, then load the DW with HAL and reinject into Boucher. Toss all the spent PG on an empty plot.


[06-Mar-25 12:10 PM] potaterror#0000
I guess I'm just a Captain Planet villain.


[06-Mar-25 12:12 PM] potaterror#0000
It's all just a ludicrous premise I jab Filefolders with every now and then for amusement, but I'll also slip in some CoGC votes or such from time to time to be cheeky and make people go WTF?!


[06-Mar-25 12:12 PM] realharvey#0000
wait what is happening there? You are doing me a big confuse


[06-Mar-25 12:12 PM] realharvey#0000
what do you do with DW an HAL on boucher?


[06-Mar-25 12:12 PM] potaterror#0000
Absolutely nothing, it's mechanically impossible.


[06-Mar-25 12:13 PM] potaterror#0000
It's just some banter from multiple planetary chats.


[06-Mar-25 12:13 PM] realharvey#0000
ahh that clears it up


[06-Mar-25 12:14 PM] igfloz#0000
I'll wait for the questions to pop up from someone finding this little tidbit and querying why their Prom > Boucher > Prom business isn't profitable in the future........... someone's gonna scroll back right ?


[06-Mar-25 12:15 PM] igfloz#0000
oh wait, it could be pinned ?? lol


[06-Mar-25 12:17 PM] potaterror#0000

fyi, do what you want with the permit for now, we can incorporate pretty much anything into the project. Right now I mostly just need to build up capital and knowledge.

did you say HAL ? üëÄ üëÄ


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
you're selling to the cx or you convert it to cl ?


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have like‚Ä¶ 6k HAL per week I think?


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
Mostly CX


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
CX and corp


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
6k seems a lot


[06-Mar-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
6k would be 3 permit


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am not at home but I think Hal and me make the most


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yup


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can check in the lead


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean i forgot about shipping so im down a bit


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah it‚Äôs 3 permits Hal base


[06-Mar-25 01:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[06-Mar-25 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
wait, you're overflowing with HAL ??


[06-Mar-25 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
so you stopped producing ???


[06-Mar-25 01:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Was


[06-Mar-25 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
please sell your HAL to me shall it ever happen again ><

[06-Mar-25 01:51 PM] marat_sh#0000

[06-Mar-25 01:56 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd feel like I'm ripping youf off
I'll buy it to you at 200, please

150?


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think cost to make is ~50/u for me


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] realharvey#0000
now I feel bad for sending it at 120


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] laaxus#0000
what price do you want


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it costs me 40/u


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Maybe even 30/u


[06-Mar-25 01:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
I sell at corp for 200/u if it‚Äôs fine for you

I doubt any new player has a base on kevin


[07-Mar-25 05:28 AM] realharvey#0000
Those are considered good prices? A lot of clicking for not a lot of money moving a ship there


[07-Mar-25 05:31 AM] laaxus#0000
for a starting ship, it's not bad


[07-Mar-25 05:32 AM] laaxus#0000
price used to be around 10/t, but it might be rising (good, shipping was to cheap)


[07-Mar-25 05:37 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, ok.  But, also means they only have a reason for a one way trip.


[07-Mar-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
again, it's more money than letting the ship idling


[07-Mar-25 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
ships are capital


[07-Mar-25 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
to let them unused is a waste


[07-Mar-25 05:46 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I dunno, its like 5k of fuel on minimum burn, which takes 3 days round trip, plus you take half a percent damage. so 10k payment feels barely worth it, even in my earliest days...


[07-Mar-25 05:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Is it ?


[07-Mar-25 05:51 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
4900 AIC fuel at current ask.

[07-Mar-25 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
it is indeed 5k fuel consumptions, just did the math


[07-Mar-25 05:52 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
But, maybe on your very first day when using 2 ships at once for entire the first week is very unlikely (so it really is truly idle for that long), it might be worth it.


[07-Mar-25 05:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I guess you could underfill the fuel tanks too and make the trip take longer for less fuel, but the 5 day duration of the contract limits what you can do.


[07-Mar-25 08:33 AM] jcheung#0000
Wrong. Gotta add the mass of the cargo on the way back


[07-Mar-25 08:33 AM] jcheung#0000
It's more expensive or takes longer


[07-Mar-25 08:33 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
So, correct, but less correct than I could have been üôÇ


[07-Mar-25 08:34 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
But, adding 500t of mass on the kevin->ant leg of the above calculation has... the exact same fuel and time.


[07-Mar-25 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
found someone to ship it for me


[07-Mar-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
but yes, taking it into account, I would have put the shipping price at 15k

[07-Mar-25 08:36 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, at 15k it starts to be more reasonable for a new player to sacrifice their ship for 3 days.


[07-Mar-25 08:37 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
(I still think leaving a bit of space in the contract to new-player-likely planets like Harmonia and Deimos is better for "new player contracts", since the number of shipments I had to turn down because i needed to move like 20t of my own stuff early on was really sad for me, and I'd have done it pretty cheap if it just covered my fuel).

[07-Mar-25 08:47 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm thinking I've checked this a few times and I've never seen mass affect anything, even thouh I know it should, so maybe that view is buggy, or maybe starter ships have something strange going on with them...

[07-Mar-25 08:47 AM] jcheung#0000
I do know that starters have a lot more power


[07-Mar-25 08:47 AM] jcheung#0000
So that times aren't affected because the mass isn't enough to overcome that


[07-Mar-25 08:48 AM] jcheung#0000
But fuel burn should be higher...


[07-Mar-25 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
ship acceleration is limited by the seats


[07-Mar-25 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
for starter


[07-Mar-25 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
not weight


[07-Mar-25 08:49 AM] jcheung#0000
Right, but if you're driving a truck with an empty trailer vs one with half a ton of concrete in the bed, your mpg goes down

that doesn't matter, the mass is still there


[08-Mar-25 12:26 PM] jcheung#0000
to have a same-time burn, you need to send more remass out the other side


[08-Mar-25 12:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah but inertia


[08-Mar-25 12:26 PM] jcheung#0000
that's the problem, overcoming inertia


[08-Mar-25 12:27 PM] vanarazor#0000
isn;t greater mass greater inertia ?


[08-Mar-25 12:27 PM] jcheung#0000
you don't use less remass to accelerate a larger mass to the same speed and timing


[08-Mar-25 12:27 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, and that's the problem. greater mass means you have to overcome greater inertia to get it moving in the direction you want it to go


[08-Mar-25 12:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
fair point


[08-Mar-25 12:29 PM] vanarazor#0000
I don' t think I've seen a diffrence in fuel consumption due to my cargo weight


[08-Mar-25 12:29 PM] vanarazor#0000
may be becasue the cargo weight is negligeable compare to the total mass

but what would be better is just inputting a desired time and having it set the fuel amounts automatically to reach that time

The shipping route stuff will be nice, but does sound maybe over complicated, who knows when we'll get it

yeah true, show the min/default/max as buttons, and maybe one slider that just goes between min and max or something (a slider for time, not fuel usage)

[09-Mar-25 03:25 PM] tanda#0000
I looked at some recipes too, and basically you had to run a ship back and forth between the planets. At least with enough buffer you're not doing it all the time, but it's still a LOT

actually if that was the goal  (it shouldn't be, ten mil networth would be far more impactful/meaningful of a goal) but you do you

[11-Mar-25 04:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
like a real economy does


[11-Mar-25 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, I wished that there were 3 category of expers :
- planet experts : boost a specific recipe
- company experts : boost buildings
- corporate experts : boost industries


[11-Mar-25 04:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, making there be only planetary experts kinda ruins the point of it, then It could just pass me my 28% boost right from the start since Im going to have it in a month anyways


[11-Mar-25 04:35 AM] evov#0000
The problem with more tiers of experts is that it raises the barrier of entry for people to be competitive.

Higher levels of specialization also sounds like a great idea. . . . until the market runs out of something that people need. There's already a long enough lead time on the market / global production shifting to compensate. Higher levels of specialization tends to discourage people from switching production to meet unmet demands that aren't already in their lane.


[11-Mar-25 04:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
maybe something small would be enough to compensate players who are forced to use less optimal planets to stay in their production lane. maybe 5-10% after 2000 effective hours?


[11-Mar-25 04:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
5th expert is ~950 hours iirc, so 2000 wouldnt be a huge amount with 2+ bases


[11-Mar-25 04:57 AM] evov#0000
I think in general, planetary conditions ( build/repair costs due to hot/cold/high pressure etc ) have too big of an impact. I think it would be a better / more interesting game if there was more incentive to spread out and colonize more planets rather than dog pile onto already popular ones until they're full.


[11-Mar-25 05:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah absolutely, deimos is a perfect example


[11-Mar-25 05:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
a billion people sit on that planet when there are comletely empty planets 1 jump away


[11-Mar-25 05:37 AM] evov#0000
There's a few contributing factors to it, but I think the relative cost of the planetary conditions is probably the single biggest one. Ability to control / get a return from developing planets is the other thing that keeps people clustered on the main planets rather than spreading out.

if we could increase the faction space by expanding


[11-Mar-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
there would be an incentive to colonize new systems


[11-Mar-25 05:51 AM] evov#0000
Why do you think that's the case?


[11-Mar-25 05:52 AM] laaxus#0000
to increase Antares influence is a worthy endeavour


[11-Mar-25 05:52 AM] evov#0000
As someone who colonizes new systesms... I can say from my perspective exactly the oposite is true. Faction space puts restrictions on some of the settings Gov's can put on planets. I actively avoid colonizing anything in faction space.

I was looking at making a small amount of HSE to potentially save and make me some money, but I need 3 bases that are completely unable to be used for much else


[11-Mar-25 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
Sometimes, it's much better to rely on the market


[11-Mar-25 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
you can't do everything alone


[11-Mar-25 06:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
TCO base could be on SE-648c and make TIO and O on the side because of great yields on all 3, but pretty much need to process them otherwise 30+ day ROI.

TC chemistry base uses the expensive TNP building that can ONLY process TCO and TC to make 3 un-sellable products

and finally, making a PP3 base wont be worth it to make HSE, without also putting some PP2's to make the LSE that HSE needs since the LSE alone is more than the sell price of HSE, and LSE has a whole library of ingredients


[11-Mar-25 06:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
for all 3 bases I would need to make tons of side products to make it even remotely affordable, but each of those need their own list of garbage to run with profit

bleh

~11k on market, and as low as ~9k on internals


[11-Mar-25 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
nah, it's not
it's just the price


[11-Mar-25 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000
you're losing money if you're producing HSE at current ask price


[11-Mar-25 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000

you're still early in you career, you should not have to settle on HSE planets


[11-Mar-25 06:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
How?


[11-Mar-25 06:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
In the end it is profitable if you did use those bases to refine/produce other materials on the side, since HSE uses barely anything from the TCO -> TC -> (technitium solution thingy)  chain


[11-Mar-25 06:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
Only 1 technitium per hse per 12h or smt like that


[11-Mar-25 06:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
I cant remember


[11-Mar-25 06:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
Bleh idk


[11-Mar-25 06:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
Most of the cost must come from the AL on the LSE side


[11-Mar-25 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
because the price for break even is higher than current ASK price


[11-Mar-25 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
you'd earn more money by doing something else and buying the HSE on the market


[11-Mar-25 06:46 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
If I make a loan payment early, does it immedately start the timer for the next payment without giving me the leftover time for the first?  (it looks like it does just start the next payment timer immedately with no benefit)

Like, if I have a payment every 10 days, and I pay #1 on day 5, do I have 15 days for #2 or 10?


[11-Mar-25 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
10


[11-Mar-25 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
no point paying early


[11-Mar-25 06:47 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I like controlling when the payment happens rather than getting caaught by surprise by an "automatic" payment.  But, good to know


[11-Mar-25 06:53 AM] pagy1234#0000
10 days


[11-Mar-25 06:53 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
And I beleive interest isn't credited either


[11-Mar-25 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
Yeah, LSE is like 75% of the cost for HSE. TCS I make so cheap it doesn't matter

something to keep in mind is it's okay to mix buildings, but not industries

Do you make the LSE yourself aswell? This looks like market price iirc


[11-Mar-25 06:54 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, I was thinking about using the chem planet to refine my HAL into CL


[11-Mar-25 06:55 AM] tanda#0000
It is market price, but I eyeball my internals these days and then just lock them in.


[11-Mar-25 06:55 AM] tanda#0000
which is why my internal cost is 9k


[11-Mar-25 06:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
So if you did make the HSE fully from scratch then it would be less than ask right?


[11-Mar-25 06:56 AM] tanda#0000
To give you some idea of how much you need of these buildings: I have 2 TNP, make 8 HSE a day, and overproduce TCS by about 5 per day


[11-Mar-25 06:56 AM] tanda#0000
Sure, but since I don't make PG or ALO or TCO I will always be affected by the prices on those ingredients


[11-Mar-25 06:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh there is a reliable TCO market?


[11-Mar-25 06:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Was looking at it but its so small that I coudnt tell


[11-Mar-25 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
even if it did, with the money invested for such bases, it would be better for you to invest that capital into better bases and buy the HSE from the market


[11-Mar-25 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
on one case, you get HSE


[11-Mar-25 06:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Fair point


[11-Mar-25 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
on the other, you get HSE + ton of cash

I'm wary of market saturation when it comes to HSE


[11-Mar-25 06:59 AM] tanda#0000
part of why I always drive to get prices down on those types of ingredients is because people avoid those planets when they're expensive


[11-Mar-25 06:59 AM] tanda#0000
and there really is other options


[11-Mar-25 06:59 AM] tanda#0000
Right now the best thing to do with 3 bases is make FIM


[11-Mar-25 06:59 AM] tanda#0000
and it's way cheaper than the HSE chain


[11-Mar-25 07:00 AM] pagy1234#0000

I discovered another contract editing bug (now that I know the trick to allow saves is to always change the quantity).

It appears to reset the location of the order to your HQ instead of leaving it as the CX (or wherever)

I might put some on the CX, It's pretty easy for me to mine more when I require. I could also provide to any potential growing newer members that might want to get into TC >> HSE production.

just triple burn up to your max production of either HCP or GRN, then run the rest double

[12-Mar-25 04:11 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
the FIM cost is absolutely dominated by HER costs, the RAT is nearly ignorable by comparsion (especially when it is infinite supply pegged at the MM, so it will never be worse than that).  So, getting HER at the cost of production is a huge advantage.

yes, DNPC needs a SME base on Deimos. you do have to ship AL to Nike though, but you get ALO/O/C on site (no shipping for those). more info in #bulletin-board üôÇ

Oh, I already mine my own ALO and O, and have a steady supplier of C. My issue right now is more that AL profits are not that interesting anymore.

[12-Mar-25 02:02 PM] jab.sh#0000
if you supply AL you get paid in BBH/BSE every week. I guess the alternative would be that I could just buy AL from you? would you still be willing to ship to Nike?


[12-Mar-25 02:03 PM] jab.sh#0000
at least until I'm able to fill the base properly


[12-Mar-25 02:04 PM] manhim#0000
Sure, I can ship AL to Nike without issues. What's your daily needs approx?


[12-Mar-25 02:05 PM] jab.sh#0000
282/day, which I know is more than 1 base can do üòÑ we've been dry on AL for a while though.


[12-Mar-25 02:07 PM] jab.sh#0000
actually that's not accurate since we're missing PP2 bases, one sec


[12-Mar-25 02:08 PM] jab.sh#0000
looks like it's about 212/day, which is pretty much 1 full base


[12-Mar-25 02:09 PM] manhim#0000
So 282+212?


[12-Mar-25 02:09 PM] jab.sh#0000
no, just 212


[12-Mar-25 02:11 PM] manhim#0000
Ah ok. Yeah, that's almost exactly 1 base


[12-Mar-25 02:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
indeed


[12-Mar-25 02:17 PM] manhim#0000
How many BBH/BSE does that translates into?


[12-Mar-25 02:17 PM] jab.sh#0000
I think in this arrangement I'd just buy the AL from you at a fixed price


[12-Mar-25 02:20 PM] tanda#0000
I need TUB moving forward


[12-Mar-25 02:27 PM] manhim#0000
Works for me, what kind of price did you have in mind?


[12-Mar-25 02:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
let me run some numbers when I get home


[12-Mar-25 02:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
probably something in between the minimum for your base to be profitable and the current market price


[12-Mar-25 02:29 PM] manhim#0000
I was thinking of refitting my Vulcan base to GF in two or 3 weeks. I wanted to produce GL and a few other products project-based.


[12-Mar-25 02:37 PM] manhim#0000
AL at Buy = Ask
700 is 20k profit / days
800 is 44k profit / days

Lately I've been exporting to MOR for more profits. ALO and C prices have been climbing, but the price of AL doesn't seem to be adjusting to this new reality.


[12-Mar-25 02:38 PM] jab.sh#0000
you're not buying anything except pop consumables and mats for upkeep right?


[12-Mar-25 02:38 PM] jab.sh#0000
what about flx?


[12-Mar-25 02:41 PM] manhim#0000
I make ALO, O and FLX.
ALO profits: 77k
O profits: 215k
FLX profits: 18k (I'm actually just producing exactly my usage and nothing more + yuck, LST prices probably changed since I last looked)

Selling the materials on the market/planet directly would probably save me money if we consider logistics costs (if I would sell at 700 or less).

[12-Mar-25 02:42 PM] manhim#0000
O has a high logistics costs though


[12-Mar-25 02:43 PM] manhim#0000
800 I feel would be a good price at current market rates, but AL is most likely overproduced.


[12-Mar-25 02:44 PM] jab.sh#0000
800 is essentially market price, bleh

[12-Mar-25 02:44 PM] manhim#0000
Yup !


[12-Mar-25 02:45 PM] manhim#0000
Once I refit my Vulcan base I'll sell/deliver my now leftover ALO and O to a newbro for cheaper so they can make more money to get started


[12-Mar-25 02:46 PM] manhim#0000
Just not sure when that will happen, I've been busy lately


[12-Mar-25 02:46 PM] jab.sh#0000
800 is still worth it if I don't have to do shipping üòÑ


[12-Mar-25 02:47 PM] manhim#0000

Quite possible, but there's always more to come


[13-Mar-25 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
BEN's not as organized as ANT is, but there's got to be people spinning up production and imports to help cover the shortage


[13-Mar-25 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
(because it looks like the market simply ran... out? WTH)


[13-Mar-25 09:47 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, according to the graph in prunplanner it just slowly goes into deficit and the last few sell orders just disappear


[13-Mar-25 09:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
I guess no one took a good look at the order book for a while


[13-Mar-25 09:48 PM] tanda#0000
or it was just so low that nobody really looked at it as profitable. I don't think it's amazing even now for ANT


[13-Mar-25 09:49 PM] tanda#0000
but it's just really weird to me: BEN has cheap FE due to the ore concentrations up there


[13-Mar-25 09:51 PM] pagy1234#0000
its barely profitable tho, could just sell the STL for 1900, instead of making a whole new base to sell 5xPT for 2500


[13-Mar-25 09:52 PM] tanda#0000
even the STL+TRN recipe is only 4.3k AIC per production line


[13-Mar-25 09:56 PM] pagy1234#0000

[14-Mar-25 01:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
I need some advice, I will be making a new FP base on SE-110a, to make DW. because of that, I will probably be changing my old FP base away from RAT and DW, and towards FIM, but, even with harmonia and phobos as farms, I cant make enough HER to supply full base of FIM production. To use less HER, I plan to use some FIM, and FIM FP time to make MEA on the side, but according to Prunplanner making an IVP or two to make the MTP is bad, but the market for MTP is extremely spotty and I dont know what its gonna do because of lack of sales. 
Should I simply buy the missing HER and forget about MEA completely, or should I just go with buying the MTP because of very slight profit advantage over FIM?


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
Ok, let me say something


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
** YOU DONT HAVE TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING YOURSELF **


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] manhim#0000
At this point it's mainly about risk management and your risk tolerance.


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
** IT'S NOT BAD TO BUY FROM THE CX**


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
Ok ok fineüò≠üò≠üò≠


[14-Mar-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
wait, you didn't get my point


[14-Mar-25 01:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
I mean, i kinda followed that already and abandoned RAT completely


[14-Mar-25 01:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
My origionall idea was to keep some RAT production on the side instead of MEA


[14-Mar-25 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
the point I was trying to make, is that the only difference from buying from the CX and producing yourself is the stability / consistency
If your plan only works if you produce everything yourself, it's a bad plan 95% of the time


[14-Mar-25 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
that was the general answer


[14-Mar-25 01:05 PM] laaxus#0000
now, a more specific answer


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
you could either do a mix of fim, rat mea dw anything tbh


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
you could do another HER base on demeter


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
you could buy the HER on the CX


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
many options


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
all have their pro and cons


[14-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
I personally have a harmonia + demeter HER base and is doing full fim production on norwick


[14-Mar-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
Wth


[14-Mar-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
Is demeter just that much better?


[14-Mar-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
Ah ok


[14-Mar-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah phobos lacks a little because of no CoGC but wtv


[14-Mar-25 01:08 PM] pagy1234#0000
Il buy then


[14-Mar-25 01:08 PM] pagy1234#0000
Easy fix


[14-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
you can look on prunplanner at any time to see if buying HER from the cx is worth it üòÑ


[14-Mar-25 01:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah i have my FP base and my modified farms all open on my prunplanner rn,


[14-Mar-25 01:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
Tbh HER farms have massive profit alone suprisingly


[14-Mar-25 01:09 PM] manhim#0000
I usually start by producing the end-product I want to sell first, then I study my inputs and only start producing them if it's more profitable than the end-product.

doing vertical integration allows you to sell to yourself at ask price


[14-Mar-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
which is nice, but not *necessary*


[14-Mar-25 01:13 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeahh


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
so vertical integration just averages out ROIs basically


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
?


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] manhim#0000
At least until your permits start costing a lot of money


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
permit cost must be included in the roi


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
as well as shipping (aka % of a ship)


[14-Mar-25 01:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
how do you calculate shipping cost?


[14-Mar-25 01:15 PM] manhim#0000
Make sure that always independently calculate your profits/returns for each types of production that you do


[14-Mar-25 01:15 PM] manhim#0000
I like to think of each of my bases as different "ventures" of the same conglomerate


[14-Mar-25 01:15 PM] laaxus#0000
if you need a wcb to do a round trip every 10 day to supply it, and it takes 2 x 24h for the round trip, then you should add 2/10 of a WCB to the cost of the base


[14-Mar-25 01:15 PM] manhim#0000
If a base becomes unprofitable, I just shut it down / restructure


[14-Mar-25 01:15 PM] pagy1234#0000
I stoppes using the buy/sell things in prunplanner exactly because 1000 people told me to do that

[14-Mar-25 01:17 PM] pagy1234#0000
in my case Il probably get an STL ship for SE-110c <-> SE-110a cuz otherwise i might aswell add a whole WCB cost to the base

[14-Mar-25 01:17 PM] laaxus#0000

[14-Mar-25 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
but then the STL becomes useless


[14-Mar-25 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
might as well just use a WCB/LCB that will always be usefull

If I dissasemble a ship do i get some parts back?


[14-Mar-25 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
you can't disassemble a ship

(waiting time is 4-6 months roughly)


[14-Mar-25 01:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think you could upgrade it to an FTL ship if you _really_ need to leave the system

[14-Mar-25 01:20 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah that's true


[14-Mar-25 01:20 PM] laaxus#0000
but the upgrade kit will be expensive as not standard


[14-Mar-25 01:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not the most capital efficient, but it‚Äôs not like the ship would be a total loss

The way I see it if I should make an item myself vs buying it is how much the base of that item profits (if it‚Äôs more than 70k profit per day I should probably make that item and sell what have left to CX) if it‚Äôs lower I am just buying it

the price of O seems to correlate with a lot of it's products, I don't think demand will get lower

probably what happened is some old player left the game and was not supplying O anymore, the market spiked and few people started producing.. 

I am probably already late to the party, but thanks I ll be careful

I can personally recommend Evo though as others mentioned hes been great to work with!

[15-Mar-25 06:02 PM] evov#0000
My experience has been that fuel costs usually far far exceed repair costs. So it makes sense to optimize for fuel usage. Which means keeping the weight of the ship down. It's also the case that... while the gucci ships require repairs a lot less often... when they do need repairs it's a hell of a lot more expensive if you're not making your own specialized parts.

I know lowstrife has been trying to make an effort to have those parts more available on the CX via consistent buy orders, but they may not always be available.

I keep a stack of repair materials at one of my high volume transport planets ( On that produces oxygen ) - whenever anything gets close to 80%, it goes there to pick up a load of O and repair.

[15-Mar-25 06:26 PM] evov#0000
Fuel usage > > >  Repair costs imo.


[15-Mar-25 06:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
the main advantage of the HYR (if I understand it correctly) is that you can go somewhere at the same speed for lower reactor utilization, which (i believe?) lowers damage to the ship


[15-Mar-25 06:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
but again, I didn't buy the gucci ship for practicality. even my HCB ship is a barebones ship with LHP


[15-Mar-25 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I usually crank the reactor utilization up anyway because it shortens the trip out to Nyx by a day or so


[15-Mar-25 06:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
i didn't look super deep into any of those things, just took the first excuse to buy a fancy ship üòÑ


[15-Mar-25 06:32 PM] o.pie#0000
for 2M AIC, you reduce damage by 90%.  But then you have to buy like 5x the cost of repair materials in AIC when you do repair

[15-Mar-25 06:32 PM] evov#0000
For me, when I was comparing the FTL Engines (QCR/HPR/HYP) I found very few use cases where the HPR/HYP were better. The longest flights I regularly do would be ANT -> MOR. Making the trip in 2days, vs 1day 12 hours makes no difference if I'm not online at the time when it arrives. In order to reach the next "availability break point" - I'd need to dial up the reactors... and it would 4x the fuel cost for the flight.


[15-Mar-25 06:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm usually online around 9AM and 9PM most days, so the 12 hour reduction worked out well for me üòÑ


[15-Mar-25 06:36 PM] evov#0000
Or if you're regularly doing flights that would be >2days .. I think the HPR/HYP starts to make more sense imo


[15-Mar-25 06:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah - i do, but it's definitely not a common thing (i hope)


[15-Mar-25 06:37 PM] evov#0000
But again, the cost difference is like, +30% of a new ship. So need to think about fuel costs vs capital costs.


[15-Mar-25 06:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd love to see some of these parts get cheaper / more available on the CX - I think it'd make the cost/benefit calculations a bit more interesting


[15-Mar-25 06:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I wanna try making some, but I'm afraid to look at the production graphs for them üòÑ


[15-Mar-25 06:54 PM] evov#0000
I don't make the gucci stuff because.... 1. I prefer to sell stuff that I actually use myself.  2. Doesn't feel like there's enough demand for them ( largely they feel like status symbols for rich people rather than good economic choices for tthe majority )

But I am a slave to supply/demand. So if enough people want them and are willing to pay well for them, I'll find a way to produce the stuff.


[15-Mar-25 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
I think you're right. I have a use case for AWH, but Akyan kinda has that market locked down


[15-Mar-25 06:56 PM] evov#0000

One small non obvious benefit is that ftl damage is proportional to reactor usage. So you can run it even lower and I find it usually cuts the damage in half at the same duration.


[16-Mar-25 12:27 AM] jcheung#0000
go too low and it doesn't matter


[16-Mar-25 12:28 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I often found at very low reactor usage, there was virtually no difference in speed between the engines. The main benefit of the gucci ones was being able to turn the dial up to 12 when needed to get somewhere fast.


[16-Mar-25 03:55 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm not making quite as much AWH as I used too.. now make balanced quantities of AWH/AHP/SRP/APT. And yes, the market isn't super liquid, but there are more folks dipping in than they used too. My objective is to at least try to provide some availability via the CX, as there's almost none at the moment.


[16-Mar-25 04:04 AM] akyantor#0000
And for what it's worth I think Lowstrife is actually upgrading his ships to all have shields. Not just making a market. They're making their own APT, but frequently buying up block chunks of the other goods to fully kit out ships.

Open sourcing idea's on what to do with spare capital. I'm routinely finding myself with +200m in cash sitting around and looking for ways to put it to use that are both A. Interesting, and B. Profitable.

Back up plans are - Providing loans. Engaging in MM type activities on the ANT CX, or just keep eating the increasing costs of permits to increase my productive capacity. More permits are in the 80mil region depending on Afab prices, so if anyone has cool idea's, I'm interested in hearing them.

[17-Mar-25 01:17 AM] jcheung#0000
you could corral a bunch of people to sell you their permits to produce AFABs to reduce your upgrade costs.
dunno if that ticks off interesting though


[17-Mar-25 02:50 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Well, besides going on an infrastructure spree and throwing money at gateways which may or may not qualify for being profitable, there are probably only symbolic goals left. Like getting ahead in the HQ level race (Is anyone even talking about that at all?) or building up the CX activity.
Personally I was wondering how far I can push the A-Fab markets by purchasing them solely from the CX. Another idea I had was pushing into one of the secondary MMs which do not provide IDC levels of profits but instead require an insane amount of precursor bases, but combine this with purchases from the CX. That way a whole bunch of markets could spring to life there.


[17-Mar-25 03:04 AM] evov#0000
Gateways - It is my intention to either sell, or otherwise contribute one complete gate once they become available. I built up the production requirements for this and currently have about 95% of the available parts on hand. Mostly just need to wait for the new "bits" to become available in order to complete this project. If needed (and if there's funding available for it) I've geared up to be able to produce 1 new gate every 100 days, but I don't expect there to be sufficient desire/funding for this to be needed.

Other infrastructure projects - I've developed 2 systems in the ANT region (9 planets) to do high tier production. Actual development cost was about 80million + personal cost/loss for moving bases onto these planets. I'm not expecting a return on this investment any time soon. The intent is to make it a high tier industrial hub that's within 1 day's flight from ANT cx and HRT cx. It will also be the location for a future gateway point. In some cases I offer to fill in a type of MM role for bases on these planets, buying things at fixed prices on planet. 

For reference - the planets / cogc's and relevant pops. If anyone is interested in joining any of these planets, hit me up.

I have followed your development with some interest, sadly it is exactly on the opposite side of the universe than most of my bases. Maybe eventually I will close down my MOR bases and align more along ANT <-> BEN axis.
What is your current pricing for a gate? Do you have rough numbers? I have a personal interest to set up a connection from ANT to ARC, which would really tie those areas closer together.
Have you considered setting up longer chains for something like AIR/LOG/CBS as MM? According to my numbers they are coming somewhat close to IDC in profitability but along their whole chain, which is multiple layers deep.


[17-Mar-25 04:54 AM] evov#0000
I already make AIR LOG and all the Capacitor types. I haven't checked recently, but I believe they're worth more for their productive value than their MM value.

r.e. Gate cost - no idea. It's hard to know for sure until the new resources become available I think people are estimating between 300 and 350mil. A good % of the parts for the gate are available in high enough volume on the CX, so whatever CX prices are makes sense for those parts. However, there's a few parts that new production needs to be spun up in order to meet demand for gates, I think once people start building gates we'll find out what those bits are worth. I haven't checked these prices recently, but as a guide for some of the ... less available parts ->

[17-Mar-25 04:59 AM] evov#0000
For the most part I've stopped producing these parts for the moment. I'm comfortable stocking 1 gate worth of stock, but anything more than that I really need to start getting $$ coming in to make it worth doing. The PSH/RSH/TSH basically compete with Rfabs and Afabs for pricing.


[17-Mar-25 05:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
Do you think there would be any significant demand for new and further reaching gateways?


[17-Mar-25 05:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Like gateways connecting all the way up north to the 2 far away CX's?


[17-Mar-25 05:28 AM] taiyibureau#0000
At the moment I think they do not give enough advantage to justify their costs by themselves. It would be a very long term investment.


[17-Mar-25 05:28 AM] taiyibureau#0000
By a pure cost analysis simply adding more ships to your fleet will come out ahead in most cases


[17-Mar-25 05:29 AM] taiyibureau#0000
But we have no idea on how much they'll speed up travel times


[17-Mar-25 05:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
Alr, i guess we gotta wait for that info maybe


[17-Mar-25 05:39 AM] evov#0000
I suspect - that the gates that connect the 4 main CX's ... MIGHT be able to pay for themselves eventually... but that's still unclear to me. For the most part I think they're a prestige item. At this stage, when it comes to Cost per item to transport - slow steaming 5k5k ships seems like it will remain the most cost efficient way to transport items between CX's.

4 gates needed to connect ANT -> BEN for example. Rough cost - 1.2 -> 1.5 billion. That's like 120x 5k5k ships you could build for that cost. ( 480 ships for the cost of the full network connecting all the 4 main CX's in a loop of gates ). I'd be very very surprised if the speed difference from using gates  has any hope of increasing volume of shipped goods or reducing cost of shipping them when compared to a 5k5k ship on low fuel settings.

If the objective is to build cool new stuff -> Gates.
If the objective is efficient transfer of large amount of goods -> 5k5k Ships.


[17-Mar-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
The gateways will be usefull for the supply lines we will need to invade benten


[17-Mar-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000

[17-Mar-25 05:41 AM] taiyibureau#0000
I see some utility where prior connections are not present like for ANT <-> ARC

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[17-Mar-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
I would assume then that the gates are simply for the big players to allow new players to expand more easily, its only the big players who are able to slowly hunker around with their ships. And also probably to collectively make expanding into far away planets more easy.


[17-Mar-25 05:43 AM] evov#0000
The volume of traffic between ANT and ARC will "probably" never be high enough to pay for the gate, unless you're charging super high rates to use the gate.


[17-Mar-25 05:43 AM] taiyibureau#0000
That's why I have called it 'some utility'


[17-Mar-25 05:44 AM] evov#0000
Sure, some utility - just..... a lot lot lot lot less utility than the equivalent amount of capital spent on ships.


[17-Mar-25 05:44 AM] taiyibureau#0000
That connection could induce some demand by being present, but I am struggling to see which resources ANT is lacking that would come from ARC


[17-Mar-25 05:45 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Most likely still correct.


[17-Mar-25 05:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
Well it would allow people to make/mine resources on less crowded planets, and maybe planets with more favorable environments and yields


[17-Mar-25 05:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
Like i wanna expand to deimos, but its full so D:


[17-Mar-25 05:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
But if theres a similar planet that is accessable to me, I wouldnt hesitate to go there


[17-Mar-25 05:46 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Would you choose to go to ARC or just stick with Nascent?


[17-Mar-25 05:47 AM] taiyibureau#0000
You'd most likely pick the closer option


[17-Mar-25 05:47 AM] taiyibureau#0000
It just makes more sense


[17-Mar-25 05:47 AM] evov#0000
But - the gates aren't live yet. There's still time for their build cost to be changed, their distance / speed / volume etc to be changed. Upkeep/fuel prices .... all of it could be changed. So we're mostly just taking guesses based on the state of Gates, as they are at this point in their development.

I think if the cost of a gateway got reduced by half, it would make a lot more sense imo.


[17-Mar-25 05:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
Well, my example only works for planets like deimos, which are full, (its at +14 last i checked), but are planets that are very useful


[17-Mar-25 05:49 AM] taiyibureau#0000
I was a bit ambivalent from the beginning. On the one hand they promise to bring the universe closer together and are a nice endgame goal, but on the other hand they are likely to eradicate local advantages and will make the CXs less unique in that sense.


[17-Mar-25 05:50 AM] taiyibureau#0000
In my books travel distance to the CX is one of the primary metrics for usefulness


[17-Mar-25 05:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thats why i was asking weather it would be useful in the long term to just expand outwards from each CX to untapped areas


[17-Mar-25 05:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
There are entire systems with maybe 1 or 2 bases but incredible yields thats no one touches except for the largest players because its a 5 day round trip


[17-Mar-25 05:52 AM] evov#0000
A pair of gates "roughly" reaches from the CX - out to somewhere that's already about a 24 hr flight away. So they don't really "unlock" many new area's. It makes more of the systems 1 or 2 jumps from the destination gate fall within that 24hr flight window.


[17-Mar-25 05:54 AM] taiyibureau#0000
What is the incentive for reaching into the further out areas? Higher resource concentrations could be one. But other than that all places are equally potent for production.
Other than the artificial plot limit there are close to no push factors.


[17-Mar-25 05:54 AM] pagy1234#0000
Wait so gates are kinda ass? Saving a 24h flight isnt even that much for 300mil+ object..


[17-Mar-25 05:54 AM] pagy1234#0000
I thought they had much more range than that


[17-Mar-25 05:55 AM] taiyibureau#0000
They are pretty underwhelming from what we currently know.


[17-Mar-25 05:55 AM] evov#0000
At the moment, it takes 2 sets of gates to go from CX->CX   = 4 gates. = 1.2->1.5 billion


[17-Mar-25 05:55 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Maybe chaining 2-3 jumps could yield some results, but the investment required just skyrockets


[17-Mar-25 05:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Are gates only 1 direction??


[17-Mar-25 05:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ah wait no


[17-Mar-25 05:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
2 sets


[17-Mar-25 05:57 AM] evov#0000
So imagine a point half way between ANT and HRT   ( IA-151 or IA-158 are examples ) That's roughly where you'd need the midpoint pair to connect ANT and HRT


[17-Mar-25 05:57 AM] evov#0000
That's roughly the distance you'll get to.


[17-Mar-25 05:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Damn, not even that much then..


[17-Mar-25 05:58 AM] evov#0000
More or less - just far enough to get out of faction space is probably a good guide when looking at a map.


[17-Mar-25 06:01 AM] evov#0000
They'll still get built - because they're new and they're cool. I just don't think they'll actually provide more value than they cost. There's enough people that are happy to build them and pay for them for the cool factor though.


[17-Mar-25 06:01 AM] taiyibureau#0000

[17-Mar-25 06:05 AM] evov#0000
Again - they're new, they're cool, and building a 16 gate network to connect all the CX's is a universe wide construction project that lots and lots of people are excited to be a part of.


[17-Mar-25 06:06 AM] evov#0000
If I had to bet - ... yeah. Probably between 0.5k and 4k per month üôÇ


[17-Mar-25 06:07 AM] laaxus#0000
more than an investment, the gateway update is more a content update for older players

[17-Mar-25 06:45 AM] akyantor#0000

You can do a little FX action. Sort of boring, often slow moving, but consistent profit.  But I think realistically MM is the most interesting and profitable option.

The issue for me doing MM style activities is keeping track of my buy and sell orders- clearing buried orders and rememberign to recreate new orders when old ones are filled. Really it just needs a sheet that helps track those things, but I never made one


[17-Mar-25 10:42 AM] archielvahr#0000

Hi all,  advice please -  If I plan on starting a new base on an ungoverned, unnamed planet with no existing warehouse facility I need to create a planetary project first for a new warehouse but where do I unload material to if there is no warehouse to contribute from?   Does the planetary  administration centre need to be completed first before the warehouae?


[18-Mar-25 08:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You can build a base there first with out any of those


[18-Mar-25 08:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But no the admin building does not need to be finished first


[18-Mar-25 08:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But I believe you should be able to set your ships INV as the source for the materials

[19-Mar-25 04:10 AM] evov#0000
Ever since there was people talking about ideas of warfare and regional conflict in the game, it got me thinking about various things. While I'm not sure what regional conflict in a game like this would even look like, it did lead me to consider a few questions related to it.

1. What factors (that can be influenced by players) can make a region "good".
2. What factors (that can be influenced by players) can make a region "bad".

I think these two questions are at the core of any potential conflict... how do we protect the stuff we want/need  -  how do we negatively impact the stuff our enemies want/need.

I think (and maybe I'm wrong) that the foundational block in the wants/needs of a region is reliable access to consumables and repair materials. I think virtually all economic or productive activity is downstream from this. When you're trying to build a new base or resupply / repair an existing one.... missing even one of the required pieces feels like an unacceptable catastrophe.

If I want to help ensure the prosperity of the ANT region, I think securing reliable access to consumes and repair materials is priority number 1.


[19-Mar-25 04:14 AM] evov#0000
Right now, for example, there's 2237 FIM available on the BEN CX. If I was running ANY bases that employ engineers out of that region, I'd be getting very nervous right about now.

The ANT CX by comparison, has over 17k FIM available right now (in part due to the 10k I just put up there). So people should feel much more comfortable and confident about setting up production in this region if they have reliable access to the things they'll need.


[19-Mar-25 04:19 AM] cptboby#0000
agreed


[19-Mar-25 04:20 AM] cptboby#0000
i much prefer using CX than terrible contract system


[19-Mar-25 04:20 AM] laaxus#0000
I believe that the ANT faction should be able to become strategically autonomous in time of war


[19-Mar-25 04:20 AM] laaxus#0000
doesn't mean that we have to be autonomous in times of peace


[19-Mar-25 04:21 AM] laaxus#0000
but that we are ready to increase production of key materials to meet our needs


[19-Mar-25 04:21 AM] laaxus#0000
consummables is part of that


[19-Mar-25 04:21 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 04:22 AM] laaxus#0000
What about H20


[19-Mar-25 04:23 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 04:24 AM] evov#0000
There have been times where we experienced massive shortages in FLX for example. What if... instead of someone emptying FLX from our CX, we had no Power Tools. Or LBH, or any one of the other consume/construction materials. I feel like the impact of missing any of those items even for a few days is pretty painful for a lot of people.


[19-Mar-25 04:24 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 04:24 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
We have the capital


[19-Mar-25 04:26 AM] evov#0000
Even in the absence of conflict - I think it still makes sense to look at the stuff that makes a region "good" - and try to secure it and expand on it. To me, this just feels like a good first step. I've been looking for a new and interesting project to sink my teeth into, so I'll be investing time/thought/capital into this in the comming weeks/months.


[19-Mar-25 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I think what lowstrife is doing should be expanded


[19-Mar-25 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
Large bid to increase production on under produced key items


[19-Mar-25 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
then use the bid as strategic reserve


[19-Mar-25 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
I feel like we have a lack of like 3 full PPF base right now, at the very minimum for example


[19-Mar-25 04:29 AM] evov#0000
At the moment, for me - first goal I'll be working on is to secure reliable access to consumables.
But I'm always open to discussions on elements people think make a region .... more good.


[19-Mar-25 04:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, your goal is very similar to project corgi


[19-Mar-25 04:31 AM] laaxus#0000
maybe we could unite under one banner, in some way


[19-Mar-25 04:32 AM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, the biggest thing we lack is new players


[19-Mar-25 04:36 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 05:33 AM] evov#0000
Unlikely. FP's can very quickly switch from DW / RAT etc to other things. HER is a pinch point for FIM, MTP ( made in IVP's ) might be a limiting factor for MEA's.

[19-Mar-25 05:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Maybe the recent spikes in DW and RAT shifted production there away from MEA?

FIM seems to be well stocked


[19-Mar-25 05:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
CXPO for MTP is empty -  that might be a bottleneck


[19-Mar-25 05:37 AM] evov#0000
There's about 30-40k FIM on the markets, about 5k MTP.
This isn't a sector I'm heavily involved in, I only have 1x FP base. But it makes a lot of sense for people with lots of FP's to buy MTP + FIM and start producing MEA imo

for a little bit of context on MEA, AFC stopped producing it for a month while ownership switched over, but we're producing again. before AFC was producing something like 500/week and I have no idea how many people were using vs just selling on the market.


[19-Mar-25 12:08 PM] potaterror#0000
Only reason to keep a stockpile is because WAR space on the CX is cheaper than getting caught in a liquidity crunch in an unfavorable FX situation.


[19-Mar-25 12:09 PM] realharvey#0000
Since the MM for RAT is fine I believe that it is actually a waste if people go for RAT production instead of making other products more affordable or more traded on the cx. Just my opinion on RAT

Problem there is that it's quite likely to be gobbled up by established players, so I'm not sure how effective that'll be.


[19-Mar-25 12:10 PM] potaterror#0000
It'd likely be more effective to sell and simply issue small grants with the earnings.

ü§∑ if i can constantly resupply at lower prices then it benefits everyone


[19-Mar-25 12:12 PM] potaterror#0000
True. In that case there's no point to buffer more than a nice round number well above expected AFC activity so you don't have to do any math.


[19-Mar-25 12:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
the issue with something like grants is A: they have to have pro and B: they have to be in a communication channel with me and be aware of the concept of grants

It doesn't benefit other people producing and trying to sell the item.

It is interesting that people seem to think lowering prices is intrinsically better. It's almost as though the natural state is to view themselves as a producer, and all other players as consumers. Like they're making some sort of noble sacrifice to provide cheap goods to others, when it's equally true that the same action is undercutting other producers and trying to drive them out of business.

I might even share it if I feel like I can generalize it enough


[19-Mar-25 10:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm still a little confused on not putting in $0 for NS/H2O, since that's _my_ cost (minus shipping). is it just that makes it unfair for someone who's completely vertically integrated and/or buying off the CX?


[19-Mar-25 10:12 PM] finestone#0000
the cost of your H20 is not 0


[19-Mar-25 10:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
it is, some guy makes it for me üòõ


[19-Mar-25 10:13 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, it probably makes more sense to calculate an "AFC cost" and go off of that


[19-Mar-25 10:13 PM] tanda#0000
yes, but you're trying to get the cost of RATs for the Coop

{Reactions}
üëç 

[19-Mar-25 10:13 PM] tanda#0000
because your cost is already factored into your share


[19-Mar-25 10:13 PM] finestone#0000
the minimum price would be the COGM


[19-Mar-25 10:14 PM] finestone#0000
but i would recommend using the bid price as your should take into account oppurtunity cost and fuel + ship time


[19-Mar-25 10:14 PM] jab.sh#0000
if I need x% of a ship for a material, what does that math look like? do you amortize a ship over 90 days or something?

[19-Mar-25 10:16 PM] finestone#0000
for example on Demeter even if i mine my own water the Cost is still 20/u


[19-Mar-25 10:17 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah I get that there's a cost if I own the base, but if someone else does and I just pick it up with my ship it feels a little more nebulous. but like I said earlier I should be calculating the "AFC cost" and not _my_ cost.


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] tanda#0000
ngl the only thing I count shipping costs for is resource taps


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] jab.sh#0000
I have a ship full time for picking up water from boucher


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] jab.sh#0000
and a ship mostly full time flying between Life and Norwick, sometimes two


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] tanda#0000
because they are that shipping heavy. And I count it as a percentage of a ship's uptime across 180 days


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] finestone#0000
im confused what are you giving to the person giving you water for free


[19-Mar-25 10:18 PM] jab.sh#0000
their share of the cut


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
which is why you need to factor their cost into the end product


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
because you're paying that cost already


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
BTW


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
have you researched ISA vs Boucher?


[19-Mar-25 10:19 PM] finestone#0000
Just base off avg Bid of all markets excluding outliers over the last 90 days


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] finestone#0000
that way everything is fair imo


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] jab.sh#0000
does fio/prunplanner _have_ "over the last 90 days"?


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] tanda#0000
it does not


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] jab.sh#0000
sad


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] tanda#0000
I mean you could definitely do that, but every 90 days you'd need to recalculate that snapshot for each product handled


[19-Mar-25 10:20 PM] finestone#0000
The only exception to this rule is sometimes the CX has a built in shipping cost if the material is very annoying to move


[19-Mar-25 10:21 PM] finestone#0000
as demand would be consistent but less people take it to the CX so prices naturally inflate


[19-Mar-25 10:21 PM] tanda#0000
BRM and CLI are excellent examples of your last point

[19-Mar-25 10:24 PM] tanda#0000
If it's in the first 6 months of the ship's existence, I would count ship cost/180 + fuel, otherwise repairs cost across 30+ fuel


[19-Mar-25 10:25 PM] jcheung#0000

i'd have to look at it again but i'm pretty sure you can gauge prices over 90 days

[19-Mar-25 10:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
the issue there is there's technically a fixed number at that price, which I don't account for at all


[19-Mar-25 10:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
which, depending on the market, may or may not be a big deal


[19-Mar-25 10:31 PM] manhim#0000
I have a sheet where I can configure how each items' prices are pulled. So I can individually decide if an item cost at ASK, BID, AVG, or a custom value.


[19-Mar-25 10:32 PM] manhim#0000
Also it has fallback values for cases where there are no bids or asks left


[20-Mar-25 01:52 AM] vanarazor#0000
dude all this convo that I just read sounds so exciting!!!! following the form of the idea is fine but the content of all this is somehow blur..

Surely there is a PrPl API that you can pull specific information from the game to a desired cell on a spreadsheet.

to be honest I have not look at it yet ( work is pretty full on lately and I am betting more on consistent activity rather than working out the math, but time will come hopefully soon when I will be able to sit down and do fun spreadsheets)

[20-Mar-25 05:29 AM] evov#0000
I think, roughly, I've seen a doubling in my net worth over the last 6 months. Part of that could be production based, but part of it could also just be increasing prices of stock on hand. Generally, much faster growth rates at the start and slows down over time. 600%+ increase in 50 days sounds crazy though.


[20-Mar-25 05:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
tbf I think maybe 200% of that 600% has been because of gifts and good deals, so that will surely be gone quickly since im not *that* new anymore


[20-Mar-25 11:04 AM] magican1980#0000
In the last 3 months my equity is from about 50 to 120 Mio with refined prun (ships included) I think thats a good growth spurt

[20-Mar-25 11:06 AM] magican1980#0000
for me the first growth period was upgrading my starter ships ... and expansions to more planets. After that I needed time to buy my first new ship and I had regularly buy about 1-2 ships monthly


[20-Mar-25 11:07 AM] magican1980#0000
and now I have 11 Ships (with starter ships) in my fleet and will regularly expand, if I have the liquid money. In the next 4-8 weeks I will have the next growth phase, but after this it will cool down, because of the HQ expansions are pricy now (HQ is Level 20)

My kneejerk reflex is to suggest an HER base on Harmonia. HER is pretty good right now, and can be upcycled into FIM once you're ready to expand off of Harmonia here


[20-Mar-25 06:48 PM] tanda#0000
The base is cheap, and should leave plenty of money left for DDT. And it's low shipping, so it shouldn't tax one ship too much


[20-Mar-25 06:48 PM] spinydeath#0000
About how much money should i save up to start this I only have the 2 ships and not a lot of money


[20-Mar-25 06:49 PM] tanda#0000
If you're expanding to ANT space, I would recommend using the 1mil grant from AGP #agp-information


[20-Mar-25 06:49 PM] tanda#0000
one ship should technically be enough for one Agri base, so  Promitor shouldn't need too much shipping


[20-Mar-25 06:50 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah i only ever use one


[20-Mar-25 06:53 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im still kinda new what is HER


[20-Mar-25 06:54 PM] tanda#0000
it's a slow growing material that's in quite a bit of demand right now. You use DDT (a chemical ) and FRMs (a building) to make it


[20-Mar-25 06:54 PM] tanda#0000
for all cap codes like HER and FP, you can try plugging them into the game's buffers with MAT HER and BUI FP to see what we're talking about

I would make a plan in PrUnplanner


[20-Mar-25 06:59 PM] tanda#0000
have you modeled the base in Prun Planner yet?


[20-Mar-25 06:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000

It can show you about how much stuffs you‚Äôll need


[20-Mar-25 07:00 PM] tanda#0000
It's still a very good place for it. I run my LABs there as well, but they don't make DDT

[20-Mar-25 07:01 PM] sansemin#0000
If there's a need then I might do my second base there


[20-Mar-25 07:01 PM] tanda#0000
Current market trends are putting a LOT of pressure on the DDT/HER markets due to FIM/MEA spiking in demand and price


[20-Mar-25 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
I do kinda expect these trends to stick around for a few months


[20-Mar-25 07:17 PM] spinydeath#0000
I cant get construction prices on prun anybody know how


[20-Mar-25 07:17 PM] jcheung#0000
what precisely do you mean by construction prices?


[20-Mar-25 07:17 PM] jcheung#0000
like construction materials?


[20-Mar-25 07:17 PM] sansemin#0000
@jab.sh What's DNPC?


[20-Mar-25 07:17 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im making a plan for a her base on harmonia and i was just seeing if you can see how much it will cost to to build it


[20-Mar-25 07:18 PM] jcheung#0000
try `cxm bbh` in a new buffer


[20-Mar-25 07:18 PM] jcheung#0000
and so on for each material


[20-Mar-25 07:18 PM] jcheung#0000
or if you're building in prunplanner, you can set up market information and it'll give you a rough idea at a glance

[20-Mar-25 07:21 PM] tanda#0000
okay üëç


[20-Mar-25 07:25 PM] spinydeath#0000
Would it be smart to max out current building space when i make a new base or should i be conservative


[20-Mar-25 07:26 PM] tanda#0000
max out each base before moving on, in most cases


[20-Mar-25 07:26 PM] tanda#0000
there's some times not maxing out a base is a smart step (usually either because it produces something niche, or because it's a shipping hassle)


[20-Mar-25 07:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
DNPC (Deimos-Nike Production Co-operative), it's a coop that makes BBH/BSE


[20-Mar-25 07:27 PM] sansemin#0000
I found it, looks interesting


[20-Mar-25 07:27 PM] sansemin#0000
Which bases are needed atm?


[20-Mar-25 07:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
2 more Deimos and 2 Nike, Deimos is the priority both because it makes the raw materials and because the only way to get there is to start over since it's full.


[20-Mar-25 07:29 PM] sansemin#0000
I can COLIQ to Deimos

okay thank you


[20-Mar-25 07:32 PM] spinydeath#0000
Sorry to be annoying but what if it doesnt cost the whole 1mil and i use some for operating funds to make it run good until i get the production to profit


[20-Mar-25 07:35 PM] tanda#0000
That's actually the best idea


[20-Mar-25 07:35 PM] tanda#0000
(to not use it all for construction and reserve some for consumables and goods to process)


[20-Mar-25 07:35 PM] tanda#0000
DDT isn't really cheap either, so having the extra buffer will work out better for you


[20-Mar-25 07:36 PM] spinydeath#0000
Yeah thats what i was worried about right now its 15385 a day for the ddt to operate


[20-Mar-25 07:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
How much DDT do you need? I might be able to help you out with first 2 weeks


[20-Mar-25 07:38 PM] spinydeath#0000
according to prun i need 3.08 a day to make 4 her per farm at a time on 5 farms


[20-Mar-25 07:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
Oh, I forgot that I've sold some already. I have 360 left


[20-Mar-25 07:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
oh


[20-Mar-25 07:39 PM] spinydeath#0000
depending on price i might buy 100 to 200 to start i have to see how it will work out I have not done the math yet


[20-Mar-25 07:39 PM] spinydeath#0000
never mind just did the math cant afford that


[20-Mar-25 07:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
sorry I wasn't following the conversation. Are you new to ADI? if yes I can give you 200 DDT as a welcome


[20-Mar-25 07:40 PM] spinydeath#0000
Yes i am moving to the system to start a base


[20-Mar-25 07:41 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im still new to the game and only work with water Tanda was helping me figure out a HER base in ADI


[20-Mar-25 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
ah I see


[20-Mar-25 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
I will send you contract I should be able to deliver 200 to ANT in a few hours


[20-Mar-25 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
should help you to get things started


[20-Mar-25 07:42 PM] spinydeath#0000
That would be awesome I still havent finshed the plan to apply for the grant so could you hold off until i make the base


[20-Mar-25 07:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
Alright I will keep them for you once you are done

4600/u max


[20-Mar-25 08:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't like doing 4690/u like 10 AIC lower than other offer I would rather wait for their offer to fill and wait my turn at the same price


[20-Mar-25 08:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
If I am undercutting someone it's 100/u at least

yeah if it's 3 digit price I do 50/u as well


[20-Mar-25 08:10 PM] marat_sh#0000
if it's 4 digit I do 100/u

[21-Mar-25 02:38 PM] wikifeia#0000
I have fully set up SME bases on Deimos and Vulcan producing AL from ALO that I'm mining on Nascent


[21-Mar-25 08:18 PM] wikifeia#0000
Man is everyone just getting LST from EXT bases on Nike?


[21-Mar-25 08:19 PM] wikifeia#0000
yk-715c seems like such a wasted opportunity, it's just so remote that basically nobody's settled there


[21-Mar-25 08:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
I get it from nike But only because of convenience


[21-Mar-25 08:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
Don't use whole lot of LST myself yet so 1 Nike base covers most of it + left some for CX


[21-Mar-25 08:24 PM] wikifeia#0000
The mismatched cogc is just a peeve, i'd rather produce as much as i possibly can and then sell what I don't need


[21-Mar-25 08:25 PM] wikifeia#0000
wish we had more resource extraction cogc's in ant space


[21-Mar-25 08:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
difference between matching cogc and not matching is 20k/d


[21-Mar-25 08:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
not a big deal when I make over 100k per day from LST base


[21-Mar-25 08:26 PM] tanda#0000
outside of resource taps for high volume goods (or smelting) RE is a wasted COGC


[21-Mar-25 08:27 PM] tanda#0000
and by high volume I mean gases, water, ALO


[21-Mar-25 08:27 PM] tanda#0000
nothing else gets used in that kind of volumes


[21-Mar-25 08:27 PM] wikifeia#0000
the trouble is that many of our RE are placed on planets with specialized goods


[21-Mar-25 08:28 PM] wikifeia#0000
LST, FEO, H, and other gases no?


[21-Mar-25 08:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
gases / water / ALO / HAL / BTS are the ones I consider worth cogc


[21-Mar-25 08:29 PM] tanda#0000
LST isn't that fast of consumption comparatively . BFABs are almost not worth making anymore, everything else just sips LST, rather than chugging it


[21-Mar-25 08:29 PM] tanda#0000
FEO, not really. Vulcan and other planets with metallurgy are fine


[21-Mar-25 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
and I stated gases above


[21-Mar-25 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
HAL is a miss on my books, BTS is.... weird and specialized, but almost all of those planets are too expensive for anything other than BTS extraction


[21-Mar-25 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
It takes a lot more time to make something out of most raw materials than it does to extract them

I run slight deficit of N on what considered a good RE cogc for N


[21-Mar-25 08:32 PM] wikifeia#0000
but there's always demand for raw materials. if you make the building blocks cheaper, you'll make everything else cheaper. increasing prod on every nike base that now doesn't have to produce its own LST would have knock on effects


[21-Mar-25 08:33 PM] tanda#0000
no, if you make the building blocks cheaper, you run into more shipping issues


[21-Mar-25 08:33 PM] tanda#0000
It's why I vertically integrate both BRM and CLI, because nobody will ever sell that below 300-400/unit, and it's not even really worth 75


[21-Mar-25 08:34 PM] tanda#0000
and from the best I can tell, LST is produced by a few people just running EXT on Nike, without mixing. We've all done mixed, I'm sure, but that's not where the serious LST production comes from


[21-Mar-25 08:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
less time you spend clicking on shipping raw resources better your life will be


[21-Mar-25 08:35 PM] wikifeia#0000
idk i figure there's a lot of money to be made if you're willing to invest time in logistics


[21-Mar-25 08:35 PM] tanda#0000
I looked into doing vertical production on Tiezendor. I was not impressed. It was a lot of effort and multiple permits to produce not a lot of profit


[21-Mar-25 08:36 PM] tanda#0000
sure, but logistics have cost, and costs must be passed on to stay profitable

I would love to see what the game would be if we had no permit limits üòÖ how far could we push numbers üíµ


[21-Mar-25 08:38 PM] tanda#0000
like Jean's base could feed 5-6 BFAB production bases


[21-Mar-25 08:39 PM] wikifeia#0000
lmao i dont even really mind the permit system, by all means make settling progressively more expensive


[21-Mar-25 08:39 PM] tanda#0000
my next permit costs 9mil. So I'm looking at how I can stack bases with other players even more now


[21-Mar-25 08:39 PM] wikifeia#0000
it's just very annoying working within these constraints and trying to vertically integrate everything


[21-Mar-25 08:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
permit limit I mean Area limit sorry


[21-Mar-25 08:39 PM] tanda#0000
vertical integration on site is my new goal


[21-Mar-25 08:40 PM] wikifeia#0000
idk after i set up shop with carbon production i think i probably will think about yk-715c and nike for construction


[21-Mar-25 08:40 PM] wikifeia#0000
hoping by then i'll have at least two more ships


[21-Mar-25 08:41 PM] tanda#0000
man, honestly pick any other planet than Tiezendor


[21-Mar-25 08:41 PM] tanda#0000
I have a couple planets, Lom Palanka, and Black Mesa I need players to drop PP2 bases on

but Tiezendor is expensive and far


[21-Mar-25 08:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000

anybody give low interest loans in here


[21-Mar-25 11:18 PM] evov#0000
< haven't changed my ship prices since I started selling them 7+months ago.
On a related note, it's probably more profitable to sell the parts on the CX.
It's DEFINITELY more profitable to stop making the under-performing sections and just sell the juicy bits on the CX.


[21-Mar-25 11:19 PM] tanda#0000
what are the under-performing sections?


[21-Mar-25 11:19 PM] evov#0000
The bits I don't make much money on, but maintain production so I'm able to sell a complete ship üôÇ


[21-Mar-25 11:20 PM] tanda#0000
well, I think we'd quickly see them be money makers if you stopped making them


[21-Mar-25 11:21 PM] tanda#0000
what are you looking for funding for?


[21-Mar-25 11:22 PM] spinydeath#0000
@tanda to flesh out the rest of my base i need to build 10 rigs 5 fp and 5 hb1


[21-Mar-25 11:22 PM] evov#0000
The thing with ship parts.... they're mostly useless on their own. Increasing global production of engines, or field emitters etc.. doesn't increase global demand for those parts unless production of all the other parts increase in line with it.


[21-Mar-25 11:25 PM] tanda#0000
sure, I get that. But if you stopped production of the non-glamorous bits, I think we'd see a price spike


[21-Mar-25 11:25 PM] tanda#0000
because they're still necessary


[21-Mar-25 11:25 PM] spinydeath#0000
@tanda  I wanted to finish this base before my application for the grant is decided on so i can focus on the new base when it comes time move to antares

Damn, i guess its just low supply then, always see so many parts that have max 10 pieces up for sale lol

Ship and ship parts are slow sellers, so it‚Äôs not unexpected to see just a few units on the market

[22-Mar-25 08:42 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, it really feels like key players left the game recently, and the market is slow at adapting


[22-Mar-25 08:46 AM] evov#0000
A good way to check sometimes is to look at the production rankings difference between 180days and 30days. If a big producers leaves, it'll show up there.


[22-Mar-25 08:53 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm kinda surprised some of that MTP sold, since it was more than a bit overpriced


[22-Mar-25 09:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
this are moments I wish I would produce food and not rocks xD


[22-Mar-25 09:30 AM] tanda#0000
It wouldn't be very expensive to get started on food. an HER base and FP base are cheap and require very little shipping if you're doing FIM+


[22-Mar-25 09:31 AM] tanda#0000
It would take 5+ bases to run one MEA base full time, though. If anyone is interested in cooperating with each other

[22-Mar-25 09:36 AM] jcheung#0000
Technically


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
You can go more or less based on a few factors


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Her is as little shipping intensive as it can be


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
I send a ship once every 20 days


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
it's quite nice


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
especially for beginners


[22-Mar-25 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
Because you can choose to either make your own PPA, or not. Or make RATs. Or make dyhydrogenmonoxide.


[22-Mar-25 09:38 AM] jcheung#0000
Or your "mea base" is actually combined mtp and mea


[22-Mar-25 09:39 AM] tanda#0000
well, I did specify "run full time". You can do all sorts of things to change up the stack, but it's all just downsizing existing processes


[22-Mar-25 09:39 AM] jcheung#0000
Well then, could still easily be more


[22-Mar-25 09:39 AM] jcheung#0000
Again, can add ppa, rats, h2o, hyf into the mix


[22-Mar-25 09:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
...isn't that still 5+ bases? üòÑ


[22-Mar-25 09:41 AM] realharvey#0000
FIM and MEA dont sell as fast as other beginner items. So it does have downsides


[22-Mar-25 10:18 AM] evov#0000
There's always fairly competitive buy orders up for FIM/MEA - IDC farmers need MEA in bulk.

Looks pretty easy to me. I would set it up and get involved if my permits were cheap enough, but the whole of the bases' cost is somewhere around 7mil for all of it. (with the IVP base being the majority of the cost)

[22-Mar-25 08:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm back with a prunplanner question üòÑ how do I calculate the weekly cost to _run this base_ (per week)? it's just a RIG base so if we assume the only cost is workforce + degradation, is it:
`115.61*4.9*7` (4.9 is 1/20.41%)
or `(118+91.52)*7`?
or is it just `(58,310.00-38,483.55)*7`

[22-Mar-25 08:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think `115.61 x 4.9 x 7` per RIG is correct


[22-Mar-25 08:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I believe that should match 58,310.00 - 38,483.55 * 7


[22-Mar-25 08:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
(i.e. you have 35 RIGs on this base, correct?)


[22-Mar-25 08:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
ah, per rig? interesting


[22-Mar-25 08:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
that makes sense


[22-Mar-25 08:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, the COGM panel shows things per building / item (depending on where you look), and then the panel on the right is for the entire base


[22-Mar-25 08:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
cause `115.61 x 4.9 x 7 x 35 = (58310 - 38483.55) x 7`

[23-Mar-25 07:11 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Didnt answer me question tho


[23-Mar-25 07:11 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
How does he get permits....


[23-Mar-25 07:11 AM] laaxus#0000
that's the whole point of the game : it takes time


[23-Mar-25 07:11 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Yea i know


[23-Mar-25 07:12 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
28 bases


[23-Mar-25 07:12 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Holy shit


[23-Mar-25 07:12 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Thats double my bases xD


[23-Mar-25 07:15 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I wanna lower SF prices in ANT


[23-Mar-25 07:15 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Wait 2 days üòÑ


[23-Mar-25 07:39 AM] realharvey#0000
29th base is already on its way. HQ upgrade is done.


[23-Mar-25 07:39 AM] realharvey#0000
Revenue is so high because I produce a lot of higher tier goods


[23-Mar-25 07:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
how do you have 5 mil revenue on ~14 bases??


[23-Mar-25 08:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
I got 5 bases but just 877k revenue


[23-Mar-25 08:04 AM] laaxus#0000
revenue doesn't matter


[23-Mar-25 08:05 AM] laaxus#0000
you should at either roi or profit per day


[23-Mar-25 08:06 AM] pagy1234#0000
I got 470k profit per day :D


[23-Mar-25 08:07 AM] laaxus#0000
nice nice


[23-Mar-25 08:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
and average ROI at around 10-11 days i think


[23-Mar-25 08:19 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I make a lot of high tier stuff ^_^

[23-Mar-25 08:47 AM] tanda#0000
22 bases, so just making higher tier stuff generally means instantly high revenue


[23-Mar-25 09:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn


[23-Mar-25 09:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
what type of stuff do you make?

[23-Mar-25 09:17 AM] tanda#0000
Pretty much it's probably going to look something like this


[23-Mar-25 09:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh, so you dont have entire bases making 1 item, seems like you have some PP3's making all different R-fabs, and a CHP base making all sorts of chemicals


[23-Mar-25 09:20 AM] tanda#0000
Yeah, I tend to do multi-purpose bases. my one CHP base makes REA and everything that comes off of it. My POL base is hybrid with TNP for TCS and ETC production


[23-Mar-25 09:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn, I been thinking about a CHP base to make all sorts of stuff


[23-Mar-25 09:21 AM] tanda#0000
and I really don't need 30+ any particular RFAB a day, so I just have one making all 4


[23-Mar-25 09:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
I always limit myself with some items when I see weird pink items that I need, but If i could make them myself then I would actually do them


[23-Mar-25 09:21 AM] tanda#0000
but on the other hand, I have 4 bases making just INS


[23-Mar-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
dayum


[23-Mar-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats kinda insane


[23-Mar-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats your main seller i guess?


[23-Mar-25 09:22 AM] tanda#0000
my predecessor had something like 8-9 at peak? but he didn't do strraight PP3 builds


[23-Mar-25 09:22 AM] tanda#0000
It makes me a lot of money, yeah. #1 Production on the server for that particular good


[23-Mar-25 09:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
dayum


[23-Mar-25 09:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
i guess I gotta focus on something


[23-Mar-25 09:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
rn I just got DW


[23-Mar-25 09:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
but taiyi makes like 115k of that a day so not really a market I could be a leader in or smt


[23-Mar-25 09:25 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, but Taiyi makes 50k per day and the market is still not satisfied


[23-Mar-25 09:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
hmm..


[23-Mar-25 09:25 AM] tanda#0000
actually, Taiyi's not the market leader there


[23-Mar-25 09:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah its tiakia


[23-Mar-25 09:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
just saw that aswell


[23-Mar-25 09:26 AM] tanda#0000
and their production boils down to 20k per day


[23-Mar-25 09:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
but I dont think they sell in ant space


[23-Mar-25 09:27 AM] tanda#0000
Welp, I took #1 spot on MHL now too:

[23-Mar-25 09:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think if I just play more, il find something to make a bunch of


[23-Mar-25 09:28 AM] tanda#0000
Yeah, I just went with what I thought was cool, but difficult enough to be a challenge


[23-Mar-25 09:28 AM] tanda#0000
so my empire specializes mostly in niche building materials like INS and MHL


[23-Mar-25 09:28 AM] tanda#0000
now I just have to lay the groundwork for future expansion >.>


[23-Mar-25 09:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
i might look for something simmilar


[23-Mar-25 09:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
not too easy like DW, but still sells, like INS i guess


[23-Mar-25 09:36 AM] tanda#0000
TBH, with Jvaler stepping out from the game for a bit, our INS production is down. They had two bases just making INS


[23-Mar-25 09:37 AM] tanda#0000
I might be top producer, but I don't make enough


[23-Mar-25 09:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
maybe i should do that :D


[23-Mar-25 09:42 AM] tanda#0000
check out #kevin-information . We treat INS production as a bit of a coop here in ADI


[23-Mar-25 09:42 AM] tanda#0000
It especially helps because it's really hard to sustain an AR tap


[23-Mar-25 09:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh cool


[23-Mar-25 09:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
il take a look on that

I keep wanting to migrate away from food production, but the market keeps pulling me back in...


[23-Mar-25 12:47 PM] tanda#0000
It's going to be like that for a long time, I think


[23-Mar-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
everybody wants to leave food market


[23-Mar-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000

[23-Mar-25 12:52 PM] potaterror#0000

reminder that this game encourage bases' diversity


[23-Mar-25 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000
I would rather everybody having 1-2 agri bases


[23-Mar-25 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000
than somebody producing in other factions ( ü§Æ )


[23-Mar-25 12:53 PM] potaterror#0000
I've actually got a fair bit of diversity, it's just that a big chunk are sunk into that sector.


[23-Mar-25 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000

[23-Mar-25 03:58 PM] tanda#0000
space and mass are swapped on that screen


[23-Mar-25 03:58 PM] tanda#0000
it's a known bug


[23-Mar-25 04:04 PM] spinydeath#0000
@marat_sh Hey i got everything going would you be able to send the DDT over my ship lands at AT1 in 8 hours them im going to start building my base.


[23-Mar-25 04:58 PM] vanarazor#0000
in the construction planner you can select how many building are already built and how many you would like to build depending on that difference you ''ll get the weight and volume ratio of you construction order.

switching your base configuration does not update your construction planner if you did not save + refreshed the page, it will simply highlight a different set of building built or not and left to build or not .. if it makes any sense.

I 've made mistakes multiples times because of that. I'd would suggest you have a look at your construction planner summary.

[23-Mar-25 05:00 PM] spinydeath#0000
@tanda Would it be a good idea once i get the money flowing from the HER base to make a DDT base aswell to lower cost


[23-Mar-25 05:01 PM] tanda#0000
I would focus more on upcycling your HER because 1) it's cheaper and 2) It adds more value


[23-Mar-25 05:01 PM] tanda#0000
DDT/CL is a lot of money to tie up in a precursor


[23-Mar-25 05:01 PM] spinydeath#0000
would i just keep adding permits to make it bigger


[23-Mar-25 05:02 PM] spinydeath#0000
I feel like permits are kinda expensive with the cost going up each time


[23-Mar-25 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
no, Best plan would be to drop a HER base on all the fertile planets in the region, then use that to make more products


[23-Mar-25 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
oh lord, you don't even know the half of it


[23-Mar-25 05:02 PM] spinydeath#0000
ahh okay that is cheaper


[23-Mar-25 05:02 PM] vanarazor#0000
on the other hand DDT is drying up up up


[23-Mar-25 05:03 PM] tanda#0000
but for now @spinydeath, your permits are essentially free


[23-Mar-25 05:03 PM] spinydeath#0000
So would making DDT base be good if i sell it

[23-Mar-25 05:03 PM] vanarazor#0000
I envy you spiny death, but I would suggest you listen to Tanda


[23-Mar-25 05:04 PM] spinydeath#0000
lol because its so cheap for me right now


[23-Mar-25 05:04 PM] vanarazor#0000
oh man I wish I could drop more agri and FI planets


[23-Mar-25 05:04 PM] tanda#0000
This is kinda what I mean when I'm trying to nudge you away from DDT at the moment

[23-Mar-25 05:05 PM] spinydeath#0000
wow thats expensive


[23-Mar-25 05:05 PM] tanda#0000
It's not the LABs that are really expensive, so much as the CL needed to make the DDT


[23-Mar-25 05:05 PM] tanda#0000
630k to fuel the base for 10 days


[23-Mar-25 05:05 PM] spinydeath#0000
i feel like i should make a CL base and sell that


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] spinydeath#0000
lol good profit


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] tanda#0000
That would be very smart


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] vanarazor#0000
kinda same as a PSL production


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] tanda#0000
oh it's fantastic profit right now


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] spinydeath#0000
im going to draft one up in PrUn to see that cost


[23-Mar-25 05:06 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah CL base are cheap :

[23-Mar-25 05:07 PM] tanda#0000
HAL's pretty cheap right now too with the right connections


[23-Mar-25 05:07 PM] spinydeath#0000
What is the constuction cost


[23-Mar-25 05:07 PM] vanarazor#0000
I mean I could coop with a DDT base if I could get some DDT back to me ?:)


[23-Mar-25 05:08 PM] vanarazor#0000
800K CX AI1


[23-Mar-25 05:08 PM] spinydeath#0000
Thats not to bad


[23-Mar-25 05:08 PM] vanarazor#0000
or less if you could find cheaper offer


[23-Mar-25 05:08 PM] spinydeath#0000
i could make that quick the the her base


[23-Mar-25 05:08 PM] tanda#0000
A coop base would be a great idea


[23-Mar-25 05:09 PM] spinydeath#0000
How would i go about that with you @vanarazor


[23-Mar-25 05:09 PM] vanarazor#0000
oh man I can't lend you any money for a LAB base


[23-Mar-25 05:09 PM] vanarazor#0000
I produce some CL tho


[23-Mar-25 05:09 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh no i would make the money or get a loan from someone to start it up


[23-Mar-25 05:10 PM] tanda#0000
I would offer but I just took a huge loan myself. Need to watch my income pretty closely so I don't miss payments


[23-Mar-25 05:10 PM] spinydeath#0000
I feel you i already owe you Tanda

[23-Mar-25 05:10 PM] spinydeath#0000
lol


[23-Mar-25 05:12 PM] vanarazor#0000
I assureyou, you are probably not the only one feeling that way


[23-Mar-25 05:12 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah i understand that the bank of tanda probably has a nice balance owed to him


[23-Mar-25 05:14 PM] spinydeath#0000
If I did make a ddt coop base with Aaron would i just buy the materials ( still have the newb mindset of making everything instead of buying )


[23-Mar-25 05:14 PM] spinydeath#0000
the mats to make DDT to be specific


[23-Mar-25 05:15 PM] tanda#0000
for the tiny amounts involved with DDT, yeah


[23-Mar-25 05:15 PM] tanda#0000
CL is the only real expense for that recipe


[23-Mar-25 05:16 PM] spinydeath#0000
okay gotcha that doesnt seem to bad


[23-Mar-25 05:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
@spinydeath how much would you be looking to borrow for a CL base?


[23-Mar-25 05:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
i can't do a large amount because I just wrote a huge loan myself, but if it's small enough I can probably get you sorted out üôÇ


[23-Mar-25 05:47 PM] spinydeath#0000
I would have to get my HER going first to know how my finances are but somewhere between 500k to 800k I might not even need that much in the first place


[23-Mar-25 05:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
full disclosure - I use a lot of CL so I have a vested interest in making sure CX prices don't go too high üòÑ


[23-Mar-25 05:49 PM] spinydeath#0000
lol understandable i do want to make the base so it will be coming soon


[23-Mar-25 05:49 PM] spinydeath#0000
Just need to finish making the HER base first


[23-Mar-25 05:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
but if you're interested in a loan after you get your HER base going, let me know. A CL base is pretty straightforward if you have the shipping for it


[23-Mar-25 05:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
CL was actually my 3rd base a long long time ago


[23-Mar-25 05:50 PM] spinydeath#0000
I might need to use the PSK channel to get another ship


[23-Mar-25 05:50 PM] spinydeath#0000
i only have my starter ships


[23-Mar-25 05:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's what PSK is there for üôÇ


[23-Mar-25 05:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
but no rush or anything. take your time setting up your first base - CL isn't going anywhere üòÑ


[23-Mar-25 05:53 PM] spinydeath#0000
lol


[23-Mar-25 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's been pretty consistently between 3000-4000 as long as I've played, and probably will only be going higher in the near future


[23-Mar-25 05:54 PM] spinydeath#0000
I need to find a good planet for it so i can make a plan


[23-Mar-25 05:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Griffonstone is probably your best bet


[23-Mar-25 05:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
Triple green, so no special materials. It technically has HAL as well, but you probably wouldn't wanna mine it there because the deposit isn't very rich


[23-Mar-25 05:56 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh yeah it has a bunch of free plots


[23-Mar-25 05:57 PM] spinydeath#0000
so would i extract and chp on the same planet


[23-Mar-25 05:58 PM] tanda#0000
that HAL deposit isn't all that rich, unfortunately. You'll waste a lot of space on EXT


[23-Mar-25 05:58 PM] tanda#0000
but that is in the same region as Halcyon, so you can get it from the the LM board there pretty easily


[23-Mar-25 05:59 PM] spinydeath#0000
so i would buy the HAL and just make a CHP base


[23-Mar-25 05:59 PM] tanda#0000
yeah


[23-Mar-25 05:59 PM] tanda#0000
saves you some overhead


[23-Mar-25 06:00 PM] spinydeath#0000
is there a special type of planet for doing CHP stuff or does that not matter


[23-Mar-25 06:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
yes - are you familiar with the COGC, or chamber of global commerce (i think that's what it stands for)


[23-Mar-25 06:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
CHP is Chemistry COGC


[23-Mar-25 06:01 PM] spinydeath#0000
Yeah kind of


[23-Mar-25 06:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
so two places to look:


[23-Mar-25 06:01 PM] spinydeath#0000
can i search for that on the universe map

[23-Mar-25 06:01 PM] spinydeath#0000
Nice its on griffon


[23-Mar-25 06:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can click through on the planet if you wanna see the COGC specialization for a specific planet


[23-Mar-25 06:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I think you can use the planet search feature on prunplanner to find planets with a specific COGC


[23-Mar-25 06:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
and if you wanna know where a specific building belongs, you can do `BUI building code` to find that:

Thank you


[23-Mar-25 06:04 PM] spinydeath#0000
Halcyon seems far from Griffonstone but it does have a nice supply of HAL in the LM


[23-Mar-25 06:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
anytime! if you've ever got questions, we're always happy to answer them here üôÇ


[23-Mar-25 06:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, it's like a 12 hour flight if I remember correctly, but it seems like everything in Antares is at least 12 hours apart


[23-Mar-25 06:06 PM] spinydeath#0000
i noticed nice and spaced out

gives you plenty of time to think about your next move though üòÑ


[23-Mar-25 06:07 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah i have been wating 2 days to fly from promitor to AT2


[23-Mar-25 06:07 PM] spinydeath#0000
AT1


[23-Mar-25 06:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
A plot on promitor is worth it though - if nothing else, having your HQ there will give you a bonus to farming if I remember correctly


[23-Mar-25 06:10 PM] spinydeath#0000
Its my first planet i thought i couldnt put my hq there


[23-Mar-25 06:11 PM] spinydeath#0000
also is there a ship repair assistant like there is for buildings


[23-Mar-25 06:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think you're thinking of the corp HQ - if you open the `HQ` buffer, you'll see where your company HQ is


[23-Mar-25 06:12 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh yeah i get 14 to agri and 9.3 to food


[23-Mar-25 06:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
not that I know of. you can click on the ship name to see what it costs to repair the individual ship


[23-Mar-25 06:12 PM] spinydeath#0000
dang it would be cool if there was


[23-Mar-25 06:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
the rprun extension has an `XIT REPAIR` buffer that will show you everything that needs repaired (including ships), but I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for or not

[23-Mar-25 06:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not sure, but they probably don‚Äôt need to be repaired yet - ships slow down when they‚Äôre damaged, but that doesn‚Äôt start until 80% condition


[23-Mar-25 06:22 PM] igfloz#0000
do you have a FLT buffer ?


[23-Mar-25 06:22 PM] spinydeath#0000
okay i just looked at them and they are at 98 and 99 so its fine


[23-Mar-25 06:22 PM] spinydeath#0000

Thats fine but generally you just want to be as close to filling the pop requirements


[23-Mar-25 06:40 PM] pagy1234#0000
It just means u loose ~2% production speed


[23-Mar-25 06:40 PM] spinydeath#0000

[23-Mar-25 07:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
try this


[23-Mar-25 07:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I was able to add one more STO


[23-Mar-25 07:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
which will help with being able to fit the things you are making


[23-Mar-25 07:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
it makes things a bit more expensive, but you can use the prices I have for LFABs to make it easier to build


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] spinydeath#0000
its better the the plan i made thanks


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] spinydeath#0000
quick question i thought you could have 6 experts but its only letting me put 5 for some reason


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so you can have 6 total


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but only 5 in one industry


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohhh i did not know that


[23-Mar-25 07:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
haha yeah


[23-Mar-25 07:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
not clear in the experts tab


[23-Mar-25 07:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but that is how that works


[23-Mar-25 07:16 PM] spinydeath#0000
what are the lfabs for


[23-Mar-25 07:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so they are LBH, LDE, LSE, and LTA you need some to make the HBB


[23-Mar-25 07:18 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh sorry still learning the acronyms


[23-Mar-25 07:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no worries


[23-Mar-25 07:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its not a dumb question


[23-Mar-25 07:19 PM] spinydeath#0000
its it a bad idea to set up an H2Obase on phantasm to feed my future HER base on promitor


[23-Mar-25 07:19 PM] spinydeath#0000
or should i just buy the h20


[23-Mar-25 07:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would have to look at Phantasm to say for sure, but its not a terrible idea eventually to do


[23-Mar-25 07:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I don't think HER uses *that* much water


[23-Mar-25 07:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so you can get away with buying


[23-Mar-25 07:21 PM] spinydeath#0000
Prun shows it has 46.91 water but you have to extract instead of using a rig


[23-Mar-25 07:23 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah you are right it does not use alot of water


[23-Mar-25 07:23 PM] spinydeath#0000
only 34.63 a day

[23-Mar-25 07:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
here in ANT


[23-Mar-25 07:24 PM] spinydeath#0000
shheeeessh that alot of money for H2O


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
the base isnt cheap tho..


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
on phantasm you have a 17 day ROI


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
not terrible but not great


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
actually thats even wihtout the CM


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] spinydeath#0000
its showing me a 75 day roi


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think your promitor base works great how it is rn

üëÜ 

[23-Mar-25 07:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah mine has my cheaper prices


[23-Mar-25 07:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
i kinda like the ice base


[23-Mar-25 07:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
just need 1 mil to build it


[23-Mar-25 07:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
would be pretty far from promitor tho


[23-Mar-25 07:28 PM] spinydeath#0000
i have another base in antares


[23-Mar-25 07:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
and H2O is not light, so I doubt you would even be able to keep the base storage clear with a dedicated ship


[23-Mar-25 07:28 PM] spinydeath#0000
same thing


[23-Mar-25 07:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
wait where do you have bases?


[23-Mar-25 07:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Harmonia and Promitor yeah?


[23-Mar-25 07:29 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah


[23-Mar-25 07:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
ISA -> harmonia isnt bad, but ISA -> prom will take a while

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[23-Mar-25 07:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but also as it stands your Promitor base doesn't need more water yeah?


[23-Mar-25 07:31 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah its not bad i only need to buy like 1 a day

{Reactions}
ü´° 

[23-Mar-25 07:31 PM] spinydeath#0000
but the harmonia base needs 17 a day and i could sell the rest


[23-Mar-25 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would maybe go a different direction


[23-Mar-25 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
at first


[23-Mar-25 07:33 PM] spinydeath#0000
should i just expand the harmonia base and add more rigs and farms


[23-Mar-25 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah


[23-Mar-25 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
maybe not add more rigs there


[23-Mar-25 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but def frms


[23-Mar-25 07:34 PM] spinydeath#0000

[23-Mar-25 07:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
what do you want to do long term? farmy stuff?


[23-Mar-25 07:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah farm stuff and maybe some chemical stuff


[23-Mar-25 07:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
do you want to make food from your farms?


[23-Mar-25 07:35 PM] spinydeath#0000

just want to make ddt alittle cheaper


[23-Mar-25 07:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think that would be a good 3rd base


[23-Mar-25 07:37 PM] spinydeath#0000
I was thinking that would be the best route for the 3rd as well


[23-Mar-25 07:40 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im kinda worried about getting a big loan for a new ship thats what scares me about the CL base

Just keep in mind how those numbers are calculated. If I buy a 100k car... give it a paint job and sell it for 110k ... that report will show as having produced a 110k product. It ignores the input costs. So it's not a perfect reflection of profitability.... just the value of goods that come off the line.


[23-Mar-25 10:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Don‚Äôt I know it. BWS is one of the most ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù things I make and it all sits in warehouses at the CXs ü•≤


[23-Mar-25 10:06 PM] evov#0000
So that chart will disproportionately favor high end production... where you're taking expensive stuff, combining it to make something slightly more expensive. A lot of that happens when building ships from the ground up.

yeah right now PPF base is very lucrative


[24-Mar-25 02:19 AM] vanarazor#0000
it is, once your CL is extracted you can transform it into PG which is the material for PSL


[24-Mar-25 02:28 AM] spinydeath#0000
ohh nice


[24-Mar-25 02:43 AM] spinydeath#0000
@vanarazor Whats PPF i cant find it


[24-Mar-25 02:44 AM] vanarazor#0000
Open a new buffer and type BUI PPF


[24-Mar-25 02:44 AM] vanarazor#0000
or look into building


[24-Mar-25 02:44 AM] spinydeath#0000
ohh its a building


[24-Mar-25 02:44 AM] vanarazor#0000

with one base of POL you can easily provide for 1-2 PPPF base depending on how much EPO you still wanna produce from your POL

Careful on H2O, roi can be a bit high


[24-Mar-25 08:02 AM] evov#0000
For anyone who's a bit lost about the MM discussions on the main prun discord - this the best real world analogy I can come up with to try to explain (at least 1 side of the argument)



IDC's are like.... if the Government decided it would create a new position...  "empathy inspectors"... and paid them double the average wage for the area. Virtually unlimited open positions, but you need to have completed a degree and also obtained a certificate in empathy studies. The job would be to walk around town and point out every time someone is a jerk. Fundamentally a really really easy job, anyone can do it, you just gotta spend the time/money to get your empathy studies certificate.

That's what IDC's are, easy +high paying gov jobs.


Then, people point out this is silly. Why is the gov paying super high salaries to these people who aren't really providing anything useful to the economy?

"Oh - we need to keep paying them heaps of money..... it helps to fight off deflation"

This has been the IDC argument for at least the last 18months.


Today ->   Hey, gov... maybe instead of paying heaps of money for something really easy that no-one needs, maybe we could spend it on more difficult things that have further reaching impact to the economy, like parks or busses or upgraded water pipes? 

Tomorrow -> Insert empathy inspectors crying about how it's not fair that they should get a pay cut, and how the gov paying them heaps above average wages is actually a good thing for the economy. And, omg what about the lecturers at the local college that are doing the classes that give out the empathy certificates. Pay cuts for empathy inspectors will ruin the economy!!!

[24-Mar-25 08:07 AM] tanda#0000
It's gotten to the point where even the empathy inspectors are saying what they're doing isn't productive


[24-Mar-25 08:07 AM] evov#0000
The rational ones are at least.


[24-Mar-25 08:08 AM] evov#0000
They're like.... you know.. I've got a civil engineering degree..... if this empathy inspecting job didn't pay so much I'd probably go build a road or a bridge somewhere.


[24-Mar-25 08:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah - I think a demand sink like an MM is kinda a necessary evil to make sure the economy is always growing. I don‚Äôt think you ever want the game to be in a situation where a player gets a new permit and there just isn‚Äôt any reason to build a base with it. I just like the higher-tier MMs more because each of them requires more direct inputs, which need bases themselves, and those bases need inputs etc etc.


[24-Mar-25 08:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm planning to put my money where my mouth is, and to start making LOG for the MM üòÑ


[24-Mar-25 08:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
Or in terms of your analogy, to start making some bridges or something üòÅ


[24-Mar-25 08:32 AM] evov#0000
If / when the changes go through - I'll have a look at them. I'm already making half of them, but that stuff goes straight into building ships. So at the very least, I'll need to adjust ship pricing to account for the new prices for things. But..... if the price is high enough.... I'll convert a chunk of ship building resources into MM's.


[24-Mar-25 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
Really, LOG is just an excuse to keep making BWS (in smaller quantities) and start making BMF. It doesn‚Äôt seem like the universe needs BWS in the quantities I‚Äôve been making them, and I‚Äôm guessing the same would be true for BMF


[24-Mar-25 08:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
But if I can make some excess BMF and toss most of them into LOG, then everything works out


[24-Mar-25 09:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I get the ‚Äúemotional‚Äù complain from people, that IDC makes lots of money from basically doing nothing (tho that money is eventually flowing back into the economy, sooo).

But if I get that right, the global economy is basically losing money (the total sum of available value) by degradation, non-current assets, people leaving the game and materials sold to MM.
This is counter acted by MMs selling stuff, basically creating money out of thin air. This can be done by any MM, tho IDC is just the one with the highest profit.


[24-Mar-25 09:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So in other words, we need means of injecting value into the system, which is currently mainly managed by MM - and in a bigger scale, IDC mining


[24-Mar-25 09:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Otherwise the system would bleed out and people wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade anymore


[24-Mar-25 09:49 AM] realharvey#0000
IDC Bases also create more FAB-Demand for repairs and High tier consumables. So they are helping with the higher tier economy


[24-Mar-25 09:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But I did get that right, didn‚Äôt I? Putting the emotional part of the discussion aside, IDC bases are currently fulfilling a crucial role to ensure this economy is going to grow, aren‚Äôt they? They are not the only nor best means thinkable, but as of rn required or at least beneficial.


[24-Mar-25 09:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Because everything else (trading between players) is only distributing value around, but not actually creating new.


[24-Mar-25 09:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You just interchange more volume of value with less, higher density of value


[24-Mar-25 09:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
(e.g. 10 CUO -> 3 CU)


[24-Mar-25 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
Really, money only ‚Äòleaves‚Äô the system through people quitting and MMs. Degradation / non-current assets just hand the money to someone else. Money doesn‚Äôt disappear when you repair your base because you paid someone else for it


[24-Mar-25 09:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But the building itself loses value, doesn‚Äôt it?


[24-Mar-25 09:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
But yeah, IDC bases fill that role. I just think it would be better filled by a more complex MM that consumes more stuff (and therefore requires more workforce / stuff consumed per item made)

I don‚Äôt disagree


[24-Mar-25 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
The money goes to someone else when you buy the stuff to build the building, and when you buy the stuff to repair it, but no money changes hands when the building degrades


[24-Mar-25 10:01 AM] pagy1234#0000

[24-Mar-25 10:02 AM] manhim#0000
Or make multiple products that use IDC as material and have MM under those products.


[24-Mar-25 10:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah probably


[24-Mar-25 10:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Do we have a IDC planet in ant space?


[24-Mar-25 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
For example, go to prosper.run and look at what all goes into LOG or AIR or NV2


[24-Mar-25 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
Phobos mostly


[24-Mar-25 10:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
dayum, AIR takes alot


[24-Mar-25 10:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Because even tho they don‚Äôt interact much with the market, they still require consumables and repair materials and generate tax revenue.
I guess most of the IDC is produced on Malahat.
I feel that‚Äôs a loss for ANT space to not have something similar here


[24-Mar-25 10:08 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, Phobos is kinda weighed down by the huge PIO population - it being a starter planet makes it way more expensive to maintain a huge high-tier population


[24-Mar-25 10:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We have some very rich and competent players around here. Isn‚Äôt it an idea to build up a program for that. I‚Äôm sure there are a few members here, which would immediately move there IDC to ANT


[24-Mar-25 10:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Phobos is an extremely rich planet though?

Major Market Maker Pricing Changes
Since we‚Äôre on the topic of marketmakers, there are also some voices who want to adjust the marketmaker suppliers. Bfabs, fuels, OVE, RAT, DW, MCG.  I support the proposal to raise it 10% per month until there is no more economic activity, reserving them for manipulation prevention to preserve the new player experience. This will give time for t...

molp's reply to that is short, basically "cool thanks, I will look at this within a week"


[24-Mar-25 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, thanks. Molp's reply is at the bottom


[24-Mar-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
I also agree with lowstrife that shipping is way too cheap


[24-Mar-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
Maybe the price was appropriate 4 years ago


[24-Mar-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
but it clearly isn't now


[24-Mar-25 02:47 PM] vanarazor#0000
how does a ai market maker gets set up ?


[24-Mar-25 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
When I take a shipping contract it's just cause I have empty space.. so any price is better than flying empty. That attitude definitely affects the market though.


[24-Mar-25 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
The NPC market makers are set by the devs


[24-Mar-25 02:50 PM] pxlfox.#0000
wasn't aware of that one. another good candidate. Updated the thread


[24-Mar-25 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I haven't been watching the pop. There was a discussion about making sure someone was there to take over to ensure the scientists didn't run away. I don't think anyone took the lead on that.


[24-Mar-25 02:52 PM] pxlfox.#0000
well, let's wait how Molp is going to respond to that before starting a big campaign for that üòÖ


[24-Mar-25 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Actually I just see Techs there and they are dropping fast.


[24-Mar-25 02:54 PM] pxlfox.#0000
But wouldn't you agree, that it makes sense to have an "official" IDC farm in ANT space?


[24-Mar-25 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000

[24-Mar-25 02:55 PM] laaxus#0000
Why can't we just use phobos


[24-Mar-25 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Eos took over the low tier electronics work, so Phobos has been attracting IDC farmers.


[24-Mar-25 02:55 PM] pxlfox.#0000
They cost more then 300k in maintenance per base daily, which could flow into AI1


[24-Mar-25 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's a lot less work to continue ramping up Phobos than starting a new one


[24-Mar-25 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
One could argue Antares is more resilient without IDC üòâ


[24-Mar-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also IDC has such low shipping requirements, everyone should definitely hit Malahat and Jeetiyu first.


[24-Mar-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd say we can push our costs to them, but IDC planets make so much tax income anyway, it doesn't cost the owners anything


[24-Mar-25 02:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
But to ramp one up to the size you need for 600 SCI/week of education growth is like a 4-6 month job


[24-Mar-25 02:59 PM] pxlfox.#0000
valid points


[24-Mar-25 03:06 PM] jcheung#0000
Phew, 10% huh


[24-Mar-25 03:06 PM] jcheung#0000
What's the lower limit gonna be


[24-Mar-25 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah and maybe we'll need more electronics production in ANT if MM changes do happen, or if drones pick up, etc. Everything else requires more low tier workers though, so it will be a  shift away from scientists.


[24-Mar-25 06:48 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
i made my IDC base very recently, still paying off the massive debt. I would be VERY pissed if MM prices are reduced. It will make that base simply not worth the permit

I'm currently governor for 4 electronics plants in the ANT region. Only one of them has SCI on it.

I think there should be another input for IDC/EDC besides just SCI upkeep


[24-Mar-25 11:01 PM] finestone#0000
maybe the eventual plan is for them to consume lots of power but that wont be for a long time as i don't see the power update coming anytime soon.

One of the things that makes LIS such an attractive option for being set up as the most profitable MM - is that the inputs span many different industry types.  Manufacturing, Chem, Construction, Electronics, Extraction, Agriculture. Basically everything except Food production and Fuel, which both get used indirectly.

The corp HQ efficency boost is most meaningful with expensive workforces, so for construction on Nike that probably means PP4s. And PP3s to supply the PP4s. And you can push WEL off to another planet like Hekaton. The PP4s can take a little effort to supply, but if you wanted you could just pick one to focus on

I think you can run/vote shortly after you put the admin center down.

I'd imagine if no-one ran for the last cycle... it would just "pause" the loop until someone does run. Can't remember seeing that situation though tbh.

cheaper ships in general is going to drive down the cost of shipping too

if you don't care about profit lol


[29-Mar-25 09:05 PM] tanda#0000
if they ever actually release gateways, that will also hugely decrease the cost of shipping

[29-Mar-25 09:12 PM] vanarazor#0000
I have a boucher base but that's the only one that far from ANT


[29-Mar-25 09:13 PM] vanarazor#0000
with being said I start opting by simply putting more STO and larger buffer supplies

my external shipping requirements exist whenever I find deals on stuff elsewhere, or when I need to vacuum up 3-4k FE from the universe as a whole


[29-Mar-25 09:15 PM] vanarazor#0000
im suprised SF and FF prices are that stable accross CX


[29-Mar-25 09:16 PM] vanarazor#0000
imagine if it was like IRL where gas prices are actually cheaper closer the the refinery and way higher in the desertic areas


[29-Mar-25 09:17 PM] vanarazor#0000
what are the incentives to go outside the bubble anyway ?


[29-Mar-25 09:17 PM] vanarazor#0000
why would some one go at one end of the universe?


[29-Mar-25 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
cheaper goods, fertile planets, resource concentrations. I initially planned an expansion into BEN space due to cheaper FE and a good source of CLI


[29-Mar-25 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
I wound up relocalizing that after some discussions here, though

[29-Mar-25 09:20 PM] vanarazor#0000
where do you see asteroid density ?


[29-Mar-25 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
under system information for the system: `SYSI SE-110`


[29-Mar-25 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
it's automatically collapsed on RPRUN, so you'd need to expand that top section

AWH. I buy them from Akyan


[29-Mar-25 09:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[29-Mar-25 09:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Oh hmm


[29-Mar-25 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
no, I thought about it? but just settled on LHP/AWH


[29-Mar-25 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
I compared BHP/LHP and found it was like .02% difference for the flights that were happening


[29-Mar-25 09:28 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I'll eventually upgrade all my ships to AHP, AWH and APT so they dont need repairs as often


[29-Mar-25 09:28 PM] tanda#0000

[29-Mar-25 09:30 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Well, you'll not see them on the market for a long while haha


[29-Mar-25 09:30 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[30-Mar-25 12:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
is it that bad in SE-110?


[30-Mar-25 12:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
I am around there quite a bit so i might need to consider getting some of the shielding


[30-Mar-25 12:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
does it actually save you any money? since the shields are kinda expensive D:


[30-Mar-25 12:44 AM] tanda#0000
honestly I find it worse in KI-401 since the distances are so much bigger. SE-110 is not great, but any STL flight is really short, so damage is limited, even on unshielded ships:

[30-Mar-25 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000

[30-Mar-25 12:29 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, but the real problem is the NE


[30-Mar-25 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've been meaning to set up a base to extract NE for LIT anyway


[30-Mar-25 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I still have one open permit


[30-Mar-25 12:31 PM] tanda#0000
AEF isn't great money either, not at the point Paris has it at


[30-Mar-25 12:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
well, we could totally bump the price up some


[30-Mar-25 12:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's the nice thing about being the only supplier üòõ


[30-Mar-25 12:33 PM] tanda#0000
and NE is kinda absent from the ANT area. Looks like the best nearby option is over in HRT space


[30-Mar-25 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
maybe in the 60-75k range so it's good money but not good enough that tons of people want to make it


[30-Mar-25 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I did some looking around a while ago. It's not great, but I have an HCB, and we need _lots_ of LIT for the AGC anyway


[30-Mar-25 12:33 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, but it does mean you might want to just process it over there as well


[30-Mar-25 12:35 PM] tanda#0000
oh yeah, you'll want to process LIT over there, but HAL would probably want to make AEF closer to the CX


[30-Mar-25 12:35 PM] tanda#0000
(also wow LIT uses a lot of NE)


[30-Mar-25 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
i'll look around a bit. I'm sure I can make some NE appear at ANT no matter where I'm making the LIT, just maybe not a whole base worth


[30-Mar-25 12:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
PG and NE yeah?


[30-Mar-25 12:48 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's easy enough if you get a source for the NE


[30-Mar-25 12:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I've noticed a lot of the old timers recommend it because "it's the second most fertile planet and permanently capped"


[30-Mar-25 05:53 PM] tanda#0000

it gets noticeably slower past that point


[30-Mar-25 09:53 PM] pagy1234#0000
does it get slower at all before?


[30-Mar-25 09:53 PM] pagy1234#0000
or not at all


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
not enough that you would notice


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
I think it operates much like building decay does


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
where the first 60-90 days aren't noticeable, but then decays rapidly after that


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] vanarazor#0000
it sounds like a dumb question but does a faster engine for the ship consume more fuel ? if yes how much more ? is there a sheet with %consumption per engine ?


[30-Mar-25 09:55 PM] tanda#0000
yes, the faster engines consume more fuel. On the flip of that, the FSE offers less thrust in exchange for the lower fuel consumption


[30-Mar-25 09:55 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not aware of any ship part sheets, sorry


[30-Mar-25 09:56 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah it says saves fuel for the trade of speed or the contrary but it does not give an hint of how much


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not aware of percentages or anything like that, but I can say the FSE is not that much slower than the default engines your starter ships come with


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] vanarazor#0000
it s like the self drone repair hub


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] vanarazor#0000
reduces the damage taken from any sources


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah but by how much


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] vanarazor#0000
because weight will slow me down


[30-Mar-25 09:58 PM] vanarazor#0000
but if I can save from repair while trading time


[30-Mar-25 09:58 PM] vanarazor#0000
it sounds good anyway

OOG is definitely the crew to talk to regarding less common ship components

yeah, me too. Repairing that ship would happen once a year, but cost 6mil


[30-Mar-25 10:04 PM] vanarazor#0000
probably some far away system will require them one day ?


[30-Mar-25 10:06 PM] tanda#0000
they're all multipliers that reduce damage, just from different sources


[30-Mar-25 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
so it reduces damage enough to make the repairs take much longer

I didn't see that Demolishing gives the full materials, so even if i build a second FP on Harmonia it isn't a waste, Nice


[31-Mar-25 10:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
if im not mistaken, the BEA + GRN + NUT recipe is slightly cheaper than the BEA + GRN + VEG recipe


[31-Mar-25 10:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
since VEG uses 9 H2O for 12 VEG, while NUT only uses 1 H2O for 12


[31-Mar-25 10:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
but there may be a difference for speed


[31-Mar-25 10:01 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
only if you demolish pretty quickly.  Otherwise, repairs start to accumulate.

You still get back most of it though.

FIO and rPRUN return diffrent burn rates - does FIO not include building degradation?


[01-Apr-25 09:58 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Am I misreading the graph? 2k still looks like 1/3 of total production (on the peak day, so maybe that's the difference: day vs week)


[01-Apr-25 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
So those line charts are running 24 hour totals. So if you have something where the universe wide production is 0.. and someone makes 1 of them, then you have the line rise from 0 to 1 for 24 hours, then drop back down.


[01-Apr-25 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
So at midnight 3/19, there were approximately 6000 SSC made within the previous 24 hours


[01-Apr-25 10:01 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Ah, ok, so thats a bit harder to read then, but makes sense.  Its still day vs week as the biggest piece though.

wait, quick question, when I go into the Prun planner ROI overview page, It says that almost all Items in the UPF are produced at a steep loss, how can that be correct if you are out here producing tons of stuff?


[01-Apr-25 12:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
bc I make the things that go into them


[01-Apr-25 12:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
they use tons of PSL, PSM and expensive things like LIS


[01-Apr-25 12:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and some of the products are also not put up for sell on the CX


[01-Apr-25 12:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so the sell price is "0"


[01-Apr-25 12:20 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh so this ROI overview page is just telling me that the materials you put in loose X amout of value when you turn it into that item?


[01-Apr-25 12:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yep


[01-Apr-25 12:20 PM] pagy1234#0000
and when you make it yourself you dont really have to care i guess

tbh 6 is a lot too


[01-Apr-25 12:22 PM] pagy1234#0000
man, its so hard to make the fancy things, you always need like 5 support bases making 10 different things to make the materials that just dont exist otherwise D:

like 19d is a bit of a stretch but It will probably work

[01-Apr-25 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
thats what i would need to keep my UPFs always running


[01-Apr-25 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
which is insane


[01-Apr-25 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its like 3 bases production of PSM and PSL

[01-Apr-25 12:34 PM] pagy1234#0000
If I build a full PPF base and have max experts I still couldnt cover that üòÖ


[01-Apr-25 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so like i don't have them always running


[01-Apr-25 12:35 PM] igfloz#0000
I know @laaxus has previously told of the benefit of having a PG base (It's used in loads of things) - so you could vertically integrate a portion of it (or even fully integrate) if you produce any of the source mats


[01-Apr-25 12:37 PM] pagy1234#0000
is PG not sutable for production without making one of the inputs?


[01-Apr-25 12:38 PM] igfloz#0000
oh, it is good to do for anyone - just saying if you already produce any of the source mats, it might be easier on the wallet


[01-Apr-25 12:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
it is possible on Origo to have 20 POL an ext and 2 bmps i think and you would only need to source C and H

üëÜ 

[01-Apr-25 12:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but yeah the CX market for it is pretty good and stable


[01-Apr-25 12:39 PM] realharvey#0000
MG for PG is so cheap I wouldnt waste any space for that


[01-Apr-25 12:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
very valid


[01-Apr-25 12:41 PM] pagy1234#0000
if I do full POL base (24) then I can get a 22d ROI


[01-Apr-25 12:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
anything under 30d is pretty good imo


[01-Apr-25 12:42 PM] realharvey#0000
roi is not as good because Origo has INS requirement


[01-Apr-25 12:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
this base is 1.6mil tho so it much more per day than the PPF base


[01-Apr-25 12:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
I did the plan on griffstone


[01-Apr-25 12:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
triple green so no add on cost


[01-Apr-25 12:44 PM] realharvey#0000
well if you wanna go for pure ROI you ccould do a WPL base on heph


[01-Apr-25 12:44 PM] realharvey#0000
8.8 Days ROI


[01-Apr-25 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000
Pure roi, I would go for chp


[01-Apr-25 12:45 PM] pagy1234#0000
to make NL?


[01-Apr-25 12:45 PM] realharvey#0000
correct


[01-Apr-25 12:45 PM] laaxus#0000
Chp is also 9d roi, but cl is much more stable than NL


[01-Apr-25 12:45 PM] realharvey#0000
CHP is more heavy tho


[01-Apr-25 12:46 PM] pagy1234#0000
HAL -> CL?


[01-Apr-25 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000
Yeah


[01-Apr-25 12:46 PM] pagy1234#0000
I already did that on electronica but still waiting for population to fill


[01-Apr-25 12:46 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh, was it Cl you were championing, not PG ?? I might have got it wrong


[01-Apr-25 12:47 PM] igfloz#0000
All I remember it was a chem base , lol


[01-Apr-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
I think we could build like 4 or 5 Chp bases, and it would still not be enough to fill the market


[01-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
well wherever they go, It cant be electronica, SET population is struggleing imo


[01-Apr-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
I have chp on electronica and griffonstone


[01-Apr-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
And pol base on origo and ki-840c


[01-Apr-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
I do hal -> CL -> EPO


[01-Apr-25 12:49 PM] pagy1234#0000
lets see if theres a bunch of immigration suddenly or smt but I coincidentally put my base down at the same time as PIboy so i don know if it will fill


[01-Apr-25 12:49 PM] pagy1234#0000
the EPO base doesnt have amazing ROI tho D:


[01-Apr-25 12:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have CHP on Bober


[01-Apr-25 12:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its really close to the cx


[01-Apr-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
That's because CL is so god damn expensive


[01-Apr-25 12:51 PM] pagy1234#0000
thats a ctually perfect, if I get a PG base down, It makes enough to support a PPF base and a WPL base fully, and I could still sell some extra PG on the CX :D


[01-Apr-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
I have a full ppf base on hepha


[01-Apr-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
Producing psm only


[01-Apr-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
But there's a lack of production for every ppf product


[01-Apr-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm sure many older player would love to get rid of ppf


[01-Apr-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
But they can't because there's no production


[01-Apr-25 12:54 PM] pagy1234#0000
howcome?


[01-Apr-25 12:54 PM] laaxus#0000
Ppf is a lower tier base


[01-Apr-25 12:55 PM] laaxus#0000
Older player want bigger tier bases


[01-Apr-25 12:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I would love to get rid of them for my BWS production


[01-Apr-25 12:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it‚Äôs definitely a chicken and egg problem


[01-Apr-25 12:56 PM] pagy1234#0000
I want bigger tier bases too D:


[01-Apr-25 12:56 PM] pagy1234#0000
actualy a WPL base doesnt work anywhere but on a triple green


[01-Apr-25 12:57 PM] pagy1234#0000
45d ROI on Astraeus


[01-Apr-25 12:57 PM] pagy1234#0000
maybe thats not good the D:


[01-Apr-25 12:57 PM] pagy1234#0000
would like to use heph for PPF since it makes more money for the area


[01-Apr-25 12:59 PM] .shiva.#0000
It depends on the type of red


[01-Apr-25 12:59 PM] .shiva.#0000
Some are per building, some are by area


[01-Apr-25 12:59 PM] .shiva.#0000
So WPL is good when you only need 1 mat per building since there's like 8 of them to a planet


[01-Apr-25 12:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like HSE


[01-Apr-25 01:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or TSH I believe


[01-Apr-25 01:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
wdym?


[01-Apr-25 01:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
like its good when you have a mixed base?


[01-Apr-25 01:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Let‚Äôs say the planet needs HSE since you will have less buildings when using WPL that type of base would be a good fit for that planet


[01-Apr-25 01:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Where as INS or SEA are a per area used metric


[01-Apr-25 01:02 PM] pagy1234#0000
ahh, ok I see

{Reactions}
DancieBoi 

[01-Apr-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh yeah, on a planet that only needs HSE (like QJ-382a) its just 28d roi


[01-Apr-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
meh, still not amazing tho


[01-Apr-25 01:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
I guess NL will be something that I make farther in the future


[01-Apr-25 01:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How many bases are you at rn?


[01-Apr-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
7


[01-Apr-25 01:08 PM] pagy1234#0000
just about to get 9th permit so looking at what to do next


[01-Apr-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Yeah you definitly don't want to build higher tier yet


[01-Apr-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Not worth it


[01-Apr-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Until hq20, you should think of roi


[01-Apr-25 01:08 PM] pagy1234#0000
so what do I do? I cant just stick to farming forever right?


[01-Apr-25 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
After hq20, start thinking in profit per permit

But if you want to maximise growth


[01-Apr-25 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
And money making


[01-Apr-25 01:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
I wanna make ships, but thats all bloody expensive


[01-Apr-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
I would have at least 2 chp bases to eat the hal base production, at the very least


[01-Apr-25 01:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could try making puddle jumpers


[01-Apr-25 01:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not FTL stuff using glass engines


[01-Apr-25 01:11 PM] pagy1234#0000
STL ships?


[01-Apr-25 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Good for many bases in one system


[01-Apr-25 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yup


[01-Apr-25 01:12 PM] realharvey#0000
I only have one STL Ship. I don't like ships being stuck


[01-Apr-25 01:13 PM] pagy1234#0000
I could make the parts of STL ships that are interchangable with FTL ships aswell?


[01-Apr-25 01:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yep


[01-Apr-25 01:13 PM] pagy1234#0000
like instead of making things like CQT and BRS, I would make like MCB and GEN


[01-Apr-25 01:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I just don‚Äôt know how many people buy ship parts off the CX


[01-Apr-25 01:15 PM] pagy1234#0000
EvoV said he made 30 mil on the CX in the week that I asked him


[01-Apr-25 01:15 PM] pagy1234#0000
but he probably covers alot more item than I could


[01-Apr-25 01:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho I feel like I‚Äôm the worst person to ask what to do


[01-Apr-25 01:17 PM] pagy1234#0000

[01-Apr-25 01:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I guess I just go with the PG -> PSL/M strat


[01-Apr-25 01:19 PM] pagy1234#0000
will make my CM's a little cheaper too :D


[01-Apr-25 01:19 PM] igfloz#0000
could you stretch to PSS also ?


[01-Apr-25 01:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôll also buy PSS if you happen to sell it!


[01-Apr-25 01:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
And at this point, I‚Äôm basically committed to farming and DDT forever üòÑ


[01-Apr-25 01:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just put down my third DDT LAB base and another for CHP for CL


[01-Apr-25 01:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah probably, all 3 have the same ROI anyways so il just make whatever is needed most likely


[01-Apr-25 02:06 PM] vanarazor#0000

[01-Apr-25 07:02 PM] jvaler#0000
it looks like there's a tiny bit of demand for BGO that's chipping away at my listing. if anyone has FS production avaliable they could fill the need

[01-Apr-25 08:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
if it's not enough I will drop one more base for DDT

i'm slightly sad that i tuned down my DDT production

how does that work? does a calculation based on both the MAT's weight and volume, and settles on the lesser of the two numbers?

afaik yeah


[01-Apr-25 08:47 PM] jvaler#0000

[01-Apr-25 08:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I was mainly just thinking about the less complicated ship parts


[01-Apr-25 08:55 PM] evov#0000
Managing cash flow issues was one of the harder parts about setting up ship production. I underestimated the amount of cash/value that would be tied up in the process ... greatly. Today that's a sunk cost for me so I'm not super concerned with it. But it is a significant hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to do any high end niche production imo.

[01-Apr-25 10:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
here for this example of market manipulation, caskman is trying to control the price to be with in 1500~1600/u right? is that good thing or a bad thing? 

I feel like it is not great because prices can't go lower for newcomers, but on the other hand, old players can't buy newcomers cheap BTA?


[01-Apr-25 10:45 PM] vanarazor#0000
MEA has the same thing happening, with EVov and allocater, they are in the way stabilizing prices around that 7K mark ?

that s not really market manip for BTA


[01-Apr-25 10:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its not enought BTA


[01-Apr-25 10:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
generally newcomes want to sell into requests or asks since theyre not as cash stable


[01-Apr-25 10:53 PM] vanarazor#0000
also BTA has an AIMM means there is always going to be BTA at 1600 ?


[01-Apr-25 10:54 PM] zillatron#0000
yes, infinite supply at 1600


[01-Apr-25 10:55 PM] vanarazor#0000
so what caskman is doing penny war against the AIMM ?


[01-Apr-25 10:55 PM] zillatron#0000
or just selling what theyve made !


[01-Apr-25 10:55 PM] zillatron#0000
and trying to keep the request price at a certian point


[01-Apr-25 10:56 PM] zillatron#0000
you could buy at 1510 then relist at 1590, this is pretty common


[01-Apr-25 10:56 PM] zillatron#0000
so you're providing a way for new peeps to sell direct into the request and get some cash and also making money


[01-Apr-25 10:57 PM] zillatron#0000
like Hal said ^


[01-Apr-25 11:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah sometimes I will get a stockpile of like 200 BTA and Ill just dump a 100 or so onto the CX


[01-Apr-25 11:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
if you look at YAPT I have like 3-4 mill of things im selling on the CX


[01-Apr-25 11:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[01-Apr-25 11:51 PM] evov#0000

[02-Apr-25 03:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You extract SIO on b and smelt on a I guess


[02-Apr-25 03:42 AM] vanarazor#0000
nut nothin is built on b


[02-Apr-25 03:42 AM] vanarazor#0000
oh wait? so you actually can still build a base on a planet where there are no infrastructure >


[02-Apr-25 03:42 AM] vanarazor#0000

[02-Apr-25 03:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sure


[02-Apr-25 03:43 AM] potaterror#0000
There's always population infrastructure, but yeah, you can build a base on any planet. You've just gotta use the POPI to keep your people there.


[02-Apr-25 03:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There is a resource extraction COGC on B, so my guess seems right

It smelts there or gets shipped for GL or CU prod

Not so far at all. Not as close as yours true but I already have a dedicated STL ship in SE-110 that experiences some downtime


[02-Apr-25 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
Hey, not saying you shouldn‚Äôt do it, just making sure you have all the information. That‚Äôs why I decided against colonizing another planet in Thalassa, but my STL ship is much smaller and doesn‚Äôt really have much downtime


[02-Apr-25 08:44 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Yeah I checked prior. Not ideal but I think that it has a use-case for STL only enjoyooors. Do we know what the unit of scale is on the system maps? Ive been assuming it's Astronomical Units but idk

Just looked big enough that I checked in BTF and it was too far for my poor GEN puddlejumper


[02-Apr-25 08:48 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
How are GEN's? I only run FSE's because that's what Rise and Evov stock


[02-Apr-25 08:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ fine. I mostly just picked them up because they‚Äôre cheap, but I think they‚Äôre lower power and a bit less fuel efficient


[02-Apr-25 08:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
We also have someone in OOG who makes all the parts for it, so it was easier to just buy from them than rustle together all the parts for an FSE ship


[02-Apr-25 08:52 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Hmm kinda seems not worth, especially on an STL ship. I tried out a BGS on my 1k/1k ANT STL ship

I only ever produce it if/when the price spikes. SSC has historically been one of those things that people sell on the CX at a price that's lower than what I'd be prepared to make it for. So I'd be surprised if I showed up as a major producer of it on the leader boards.

Depends how you define profits. You might be looking at how pricing affects supply demand purely through the lens of production / cost of production.

For me.... "high" prices aren't as much in relation to the cost of production ( it does play a part, but a relatively small part in a lot of cases )... but relative to what I expect the future price to be, and what I might have bought my existing stock at.

For context - my CX activity for MEA over the last 6 or 7 months ->

Over the last 6 months roughly - I produced 5k mea. But I bought 20k. So for this item at least... production costs are not super high on the list of factors that are important to me.


[03-Apr-25 05:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
my production matches the current daily sales and that being the lowest at ask it should go fine, it usually goafter a couple of days


[03-Apr-25 05:13 AM] vanarazor#0000
it does makes sense, scientists are fine breed with a fine taste. for meMEA is a potential 200-400k profit unless I sell at bid and I make no great margin if you take in cosideration the investment for the IVPs

[03-Apr-25 06:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Higher prices often mean either less production or higher demand. We lost two big players lately, but I think we have a good income of people lately, too.
Also, the AGP and other programs boost player quicker into the economy.


[03-Apr-25 06:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
needs quite a chunk of PG tho


[03-Apr-25 06:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Over all, higher prices speak for open opportunities


[03-Apr-25 06:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah actually it might be because of PG, increased a little while ago, and around the same time it rose there was a spike in NL price aswell, only reason NL recovered was because NL volume was very down for a week or two


[03-Apr-25 07:40 AM] magican1980#0000
on all products without market makers, the price moves on demand/supply - On the other side you have the seller - has he the time to wait or change prices regularly to sell their items - for example Rations - @Benten If you sell at 165 (your fist item is sold after 60k units are sold) @Antares your are the first to take the buy (no open sell-order at 165)


[03-Apr-25 07:41 AM] magican1980#0000
in the market are not only producers, who sell their item, but also Traders, who are set buy-orders and sell at the same station at higher prices ... its feels like stocktrading and you must have the cashreserves to do this


[03-Apr-25 07:45 AM] magican1980#0000
on other example is - I produce about 971 carbon daily, about 6.800 units per week -> if I would double the production, the prices would drop down, because their is to much influx to the market. Also at my CX's there a lot of active traders üôÇ


[03-Apr-25 10:41 AM] jcheung#0000
You think 1k c/d would be enough to drop the c price a lot?


[03-Apr-25 10:42 AM] jcheung#0000
The daily volume is around 5k per day on ant


[03-Apr-25 10:44 AM] jcheung#0000
Which means that any price lowering from the introduction of 1k c/d would be slow at best, assuming it doesn't just get snapped up

yes i know, but I now only have 2 open permits, 1 for DDT and the second I'm thinking of PG/EPO-Base


[04-Apr-25 01:25 AM] magican1980#0000
after the next 2 bases are put down, I will downscale Carbon, which comes with 2 open permits and 20 free HYF - can make more RAT or go into COF-Production, which has high prices in the last 2 weeks - also check my ships and the needed logistic times üôÇ


[04-Apr-25 03:20 AM] vanarazor#0000
im so jealous of people able to afford LAB - DDT


[04-Apr-25 03:26 AM] vanarazor#0000
but my production is part of a project, I get around 800 C /w. which is more than what a solo Cproduction would give me in terms of profit. I m kind of amazed

I was literally thinking of dropping another CL and EPO bases before my DDT ..

@laaxus where does all your EPO go 25K a day ? üòÆ


[04-Apr-25 03:31 AM] laaxus#0000
RFabs


[04-Apr-25 03:31 AM] laaxus#0000
(don't produce RFabs, there's an overproduction currently)


[04-Apr-25 03:32 AM] vanarazor#0000
mean what ? 7 EPO base for 4 Rfabs ?


[04-Apr-25 03:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I have 2 EPO base


[04-Apr-25 03:32 AM] laaxus#0000
which is more than I need for my RBH production, less than I need for RSE


[04-Apr-25 03:33 AM] laaxus#0000
so I buy from the market for the difference


[04-Apr-25 03:33 AM] vanarazor#0000

You mean the universe reset?


[04-Apr-25 04:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The universe will only be reseted if a new feature requires it (like probably the planned electricity system). I‚Äôm not sure if anybody can tell you for sure how the devs will handle it then


[04-Apr-25 05:11 AM] realharvey#0000

I actually do get what they're saying...


[04-Apr-25 03:13 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm just not sure if I agree with them


[04-Apr-25 03:15 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I had a similar view on ships when I started - they don't generate value, so they are something you can't really include in your calculations. You just need to save up, until you have enough money to buy them...


[04-Apr-25 03:16 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Then I had a few discussions about ships with EvoV, and whenever I talk about that topic I hear his ~~voice~~ texts: "ships aren't free"


[04-Apr-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
shipingp is part of the base


[04-Apr-25 03:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I see how this makes sense


[04-Apr-25 03:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I think the difficult part is, that not every base takes the same amount of ship


[04-Apr-25 03:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
some only need like 10% of the ship, others need 2 ships


[04-Apr-25 03:18 PM] tanda#0000
They don't generate value, they are part of the base, something necessary for it to run. I figure ship cost by fraction of ship committed


[04-Apr-25 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I can understand that viewpoint. I just don't agree that 5.8M of my equity goes up in smoke when I buy a new ship üòÑ


[04-Apr-25 03:18 PM] laaxus#0000
ships are VERY cheap for what they provide


[04-Apr-25 03:19 PM] laaxus#0000
I honestly think ship repair cost should be multiplied by 10 at least


[04-Apr-25 03:19 PM] pxlfox.#0000
why?


[04-Apr-25 03:19 PM] laaxus#0000
because ship repair is basically free right now


[04-Apr-25 03:19 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and?


[04-Apr-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
It makes shipping extremmely cheap


[04-Apr-25 03:20 PM] pxlfox.#0000
which isn't a bad thing, is it?


[04-Apr-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
it's not bad per se


[04-Apr-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
just make the game less deep imo


[04-Apr-25 03:21 PM] pxlfox.#0000
more expensive shipping wouldn't change anything about the game - it would make things more expensive


[04-Apr-25 03:21 PM] laaxus#0000
it's so cheap that the gateways will never be worth it, most probably


[04-Apr-25 03:21 PM] pxlfox.#0000
That I can kinda agree on, tho I don't know the math


[04-Apr-25 03:22 PM] igfloz#0000
I have noticed you use the word "free" quite a lot recently.... I do not think it means what you think it means. C is basically free, shipping is basically free etc. - - - this is not true, it has a cost


[04-Apr-25 03:23 PM] pxlfox.#0000
what makes the game "less deep" is the fact, that most of the production chains end in ship parts. There is no other real production goals. This whole universe is basically a big VW factory

{Reactions}
ü§£ 

[04-Apr-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
I use the word free with 2 different meaning there
Free for the ship repair : free as absolute term. it's honestly a rounding error.
Free for AL & C production : free as relative/accounting term. You're not earning much value producing them

[04-Apr-25 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
in economic terms., profit is not done on an absolute manners, but in a relative manners.
AL is free, because  producing it does not create value at current market price


[04-Apr-25 03:27 PM] igfloz#0000
AIC365K is not free in any way when you buy C for production chains (well....... if you're only sitting on 1 mil AIC of cash)

I wish they would introduce war in this economical universe!!! What is a federation without war, what is an empire without war? this could be a way to burn ship production for a chance to get something out of it ? political power earn by winning a skirmish.

there's two discord paradigms I see.
restrict access to _privileged_ roles and channels (think admin roles/channels)
hide channels but anyone can add/remove the roles at will (this can be done with a bot or server onboarding)
and there's no reason these can't co-exist.


[04-Apr-25 04:49 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, an overview of each thing, and then users can grab a role to see the other channels/info/etc.


[04-Apr-25 04:50 PM] jab.sh#0000
of course as admins you're stuck with all of the channels all the time üòõ

Not that I'm trying to give any kind of advice... and I'm not trying to infer that this server is sub-standard. I have joined other servers (different styles, different games) - but they kind of open with a mission statement (what it's all about, goals, etc.) -  then you can get roles to view channels that you can input into (not the whole apple so to speak)

[05-Apr-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Regards the discussion in #agp-operations - Everything produced by people to be used internally or traded privately (and therefore not reaching the market) is ultimately still relieving the market, so I think for a market analysis tool, we can ignore that


[05-Apr-25 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
For my own tool, I excluded all ask and bid orders from the book, which are more then double the current prices, to get a better feeling of actual demand and supply, since some people park there mats there


[05-Apr-25 03:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And I added the traded amount as demand, tho I‚Äôm not quite sure, if that‚Äôs the right way.

[05-Apr-25 04:48 AM] vanarazor#0000
I wish I could consult the volume registered last week as well


[05-Apr-25 04:49 AM] vanarazor#0000
120K volume at MOR last week


[05-Apr-25 04:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
you probably could with the FIO data


[05-Apr-25 04:49 AM] vanarazor#0000
how's that work


[05-Apr-25 04:49 AM] vanarazor#0000
?


[05-Apr-25 04:52 AM] vanarazor#0000
do you think people could be buying a lot of EPO at MOR and come to sell it at ANT ?


[05-Apr-25 04:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm not that familiar with CX to CX trading üòÖ


[05-Apr-25 04:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
- IMPORTDATA("https://rest.fnar.net/csv/cxpc/EPO.AI")
- Filter by 'Interval'=DAY_ONE and 'TimeEpocheMs' in your timeframe and sum the 'Traded' values

[05-Apr-25 05:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You don't need no python do to so

right now im  on github reading the fio wrapper page


[05-Apr-25 05:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That's a quick sheet taking the data from the endpoint, filtering it by time frame and sums all the traded amounts


[05-Apr-25 06:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
generally, when I fly faster in my ship, im supposed to have higher damage right?


[05-Apr-25 06:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
in SE-110 its the opposite for me (flying faster = less damage)


[05-Apr-25 06:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
is that just because of how bad the meteor level is?


[05-Apr-25 06:57 AM] realharvey#0000
click the fuel slider without moving it


[05-Apr-25 06:57 AM] realharvey#0000
you'll find 2 different outcomes


[05-Apr-25 06:57 AM] realharvey#0000
it might be related to which route it takes to the planet


[05-Apr-25 10:50 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Maybe less time in meteor = less damage?


[05-Apr-25 10:51 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Meteoroid*


[05-Apr-25 11:14 AM] kk100762#0000
Even if I have 10 farms in a base I can only have 5 queues?


[05-Apr-25 11:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, unless you get PRO to unlock reocurring orders


[05-Apr-25 11:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Iirc queues unlock with higher HQ level


[05-Apr-25 11:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah but its very slow for that, i believe at HQ5 you get the 6th slot, and HQ10 you get 7th slot. Beyond that i have no idea


[05-Apr-25 12:04 PM] megamint#0000
How do I get a third ship?


[05-Apr-25 12:06 PM] tanda#0000
You need PRO to build and operate a third ship, but what you do is buy all the parts from someone, bring them to a shipyard (for us that's generally going to be Hephaestus), build the blueprint for the ship you're making in  BLU, create a shipyard project to build the ship, then add the parts to the project and start it


[05-Apr-25 12:06 PM] tanda#0000
It'll take 24 hours or so to build the ship from that point


[05-Apr-25 12:08 PM] megamint#0000
Thank you


[05-Apr-25 12:13 PM] tanda#0000
Given your stage of the game, though: You'll want to upgrade your ships first, ADI has a PSK project that handles both loans and upgrade kits for new players


[05-Apr-25 12:13 PM] megamint#0000
Interesting. I'll give it some thought and might come back in a couple days.


[05-Apr-25 12:14 PM] megamint#0000
What are the benefits to upgrading a ship?


[05-Apr-25 12:14 PM] igfloz#0000
#psk-information


[05-Apr-25 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
no rush, you'll probably start needing to upgrade ships around your 3rd or 4th base anyway


[05-Apr-25 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
Upgraded ships is pretty much just swapping out the cargo hold


[05-Apr-25 12:14 PM] igfloz#0000
You basically upgrade your ship form a starter ship into a WCB


[05-Apr-25 01:24 PM] kk100762#0000
üò≠so it is better to set a long production time?


[05-Apr-25 01:24 PM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, can be


[05-Apr-25 01:25 PM] tanda#0000
it's best to use recurring production where possible


[05-Apr-25 01:26 PM] igfloz#0000
you know you can set a recurring product right ?


[05-Apr-25 01:26 PM] igfloz#0000
doh ! Tanda beat me to it , lol


[05-Apr-25 01:26 PM] tanda#0000
I wouldn't advise using a production time longer than 24 hours, or you may run into issues with storage

ye but cant use this recurring order well


[05-Apr-25 01:30 PM] kk100762#0000
It always makes all of my farm
produce the top order


[05-Apr-25 01:31 PM] igfloz#0000
No, it will cycle through the queued list.

[05-Apr-25 01:31 PM] igfloz#0000
You have 2 lists if you open up details on your production


[05-Apr-25 01:32 PM] igfloz#0000
you have your active production queue and you have you queued list of desired production


[05-Apr-25 01:32 PM] kk100762#0000
reallyÔºüI will try it tomorrow ,thanks


[05-Apr-25 01:33 PM] igfloz#0000
If you are working a multi product planet, each industry will have it's own separate queue


[05-Apr-25 01:35 PM] igfloz#0000
Like so

[05-Apr-25 01:36 PM] tanda#0000
If your production lines are all empty, ofc it's going to fill with the first order you put in. If you care that much about being balanced even right now, just fill your production lines first, then fill your queues with recurring orders


[05-Apr-25 01:37 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh yeah, right - I missed that üëÜ


[05-Apr-25 02:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
So i'll sound the alarm. SF is at 17.7 now.


[05-Apr-25 02:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
what on earth....


[05-Apr-25 02:29 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And there is only 400k under the MM.


[05-Apr-25 02:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
did a major order get deleted from market? why was there such a gap between the order around 16.6 and these ones now??


[05-Apr-25 02:30 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I dont know, i noticed the gap and adjusted my order


[05-Apr-25 02:31 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
It seems like tuf goodz orders expired


[05-Apr-25 02:31 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I think


[05-Apr-25 02:31 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I'll import fuel from BEN.


[05-Apr-25 02:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
much apreciated


[05-Apr-25 02:32 PM] pagy1234#0000
will stock up, I will really have to cut down on fuel usage if this continues


[05-Apr-25 02:32 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Nvm BEN is also high


[05-Apr-25 02:32 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Its at 16 ask


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
It never recovered from when I dumped 9mil and  pushed up prices to 17


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
hahaha


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And ANT is suffering from lack of demand


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Lack of supply*


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Mixed it up lol


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Interesting tho, last week my fuel wouldnt sell


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And this week it just vanished


[05-Apr-25 02:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
btw FF also doesnt look great, eventualy gravy's orders will be gone and then there will be hardly anything left


[05-Apr-25 02:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
FF i can remedy by rerouting all the FF to ANT instead of MOR


[05-Apr-25 02:35 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
But SF i cant because I am already selling all my SF at ANT


[05-Apr-25 02:35 PM] tanda#0000
well, maybe with the new higher prices, it'll make sense for some new players to get into fuel


[05-Apr-25 02:35 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Yea


[05-Apr-25 02:35 PM] pagy1234#0000
incoming H crash?

[05-Apr-25 02:36 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Ant uses so much fuel


[05-Apr-25 02:36 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah dont know why lol


[05-Apr-25 02:36 PM] vanarazor#0000
I was literally looking at prices last night (10 hours ago)


[05-Apr-25 02:37 PM] pagy1234#0000
SF and FF consumption is higher than anywhere else lol


[05-Apr-25 02:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
it 's not a great ROI but sounds liquid!!

üëÜ 

[05-Apr-25 02:38 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, the margins for fuel are in owning the whole process


[05-Apr-25 02:38 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
This


[05-Apr-25 02:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
it does feel like extraction bases can sustain multiple refineries


[05-Apr-25 02:38 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Why?


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
I haven't looked at load balancing, but someone could probably do well to start a fuel coop


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] vanarazor#0000
Im keen


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am happy to open a 1 permit refinery base in ANT if i get consistent H, GAL and AMM supply from ADI.


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] pagy1234#0000
well I assume more people will get into fuel, and both fuels use H, so H will go up aswell if people dont adjust


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] vanarazor#0000
I was about to day the same


[05-Apr-25 02:39 PM] vanarazor#0000
I don;t have fund for a gaz hauler yet

welp


[05-Apr-25 02:40 PM] tanda#0000
be the change you wish to see?


[05-Apr-25 02:40 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Is it time to reorganise my 3 permit SF base to 3 different SF bases?


[05-Apr-25 02:40 PM] tanda#0000
ooh, make sure to line up your ships for it first


[05-Apr-25 02:40 PM] tanda#0000
that's a lot of shipping changes


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I dont have excess GAL and H tho


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah I thought about logitstics for refinery and you might a couple of gaz haulers


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
first


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I have enough ships


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
1-2 wcb for minerals


[05-Apr-25 02:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
1x WCB, 2x LCBs are dedicated just for GAL, H and SF export


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
AMM i occasionally send with another LCB


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
jesus I just have 2 wcb


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
this game....


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I have a lot more ships now including an HCB and another VCB to HCB upgrade on order


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
eveyrtime im short of a few dozen millions


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
In total i have like 5 LCBs now


[05-Apr-25 02:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
So i am fine with the shipping


[05-Apr-25 02:43 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I need GAL and H tho.

I still have a permit open


[05-Apr-25 02:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
i was supposed to be DDT


[05-Apr-25 02:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
but can be REF or anything needed in


[05-Apr-25 02:44 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Still need GAL


[05-Apr-25 02:44 PM] vanarazor#0000
I just cant ship


[05-Apr-25 02:44 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And H and AMM


[05-Apr-25 02:44 PM] vanarazor#0000
2 wcb is enough for my 12 (barely when is refill time, so IM trying to staggered the refill time)


[05-Apr-25 02:44 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
If someone makes a GAL base, I will consume half of the output and can ship the stuff üôÇ


[05-Apr-25 02:45 PM] vanarazor#0000
let me consult prplan


[05-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Ok


[05-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I will also need H


[05-Apr-25 02:45 PM] vanarazor#0000
where is your REF base ? zv 759 ? zv 307 ?


[05-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
LS-746b


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] vanarazor#0000
ohhh man that's HRT


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
The new base will be closer to ANT


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] vanarazor#0000
area


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
No


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Thats between ANT and BEN


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
1 jump from Styx


[05-Apr-25 02:46 PM] vanarazor#0000

[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Too far away


[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah H/AR


[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am not spending more than 1 permit on this


[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Permits are too expensive


[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] vanarazor#0000
the closest best would be kw-976c


[05-Apr-25 02:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
KW-976c is where my current GAL base is lol


[05-Apr-25 02:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
damn actually a COL base on KI-401d looks really good in general, 22d ROI but 108k/d without experts


[05-Apr-25 02:48 PM] vanarazor#0000
have a look at the shipping


[05-Apr-25 02:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
147k/d with

so wait you already have a3 base SF ?


[05-Apr-25 02:48 PM] vanarazor#0000
and you want a new set up ? ?


[05-Apr-25 02:49 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

Except AMM


[05-Apr-25 02:49 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Makes logistics easier


[05-Apr-25 02:49 PM] vanarazor#0000
means 8 permits?


[05-Apr-25 02:50 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I didnt have 15 ships earlier....


[05-Apr-25 02:50 PM] vanarazor#0000
fair enough


[05-Apr-25 02:50 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
1 for HE3, 2 for H, 1 for GAL, 3 for SF and 3 for FF


[05-Apr-25 02:50 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Total 10 permits for 420k fuel a week


[05-Apr-25 02:51 PM] vanarazor#0000
very cool


[05-Apr-25 02:51 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Plus 1 permit for HE3 and 1 for H owned by others of which i buy 100% output


[05-Apr-25 02:52 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
So yea, a lot of bases in my fuel empire


[05-Apr-25 02:52 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And i am looking to become more permit efficient


[05-Apr-25 02:52 PM] vanarazor#0000
the closest spot for H isKI-401d


[05-Apr-25 02:52 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am not going setup more raw material bases tho


[05-Apr-25 02:52 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Just SF


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] vanarazor#0000
imnot even considering zv-759g


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Why


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] vanarazor#0000
becasue that'37%?


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] vanarazor#0000
/66%?


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
My ANT H base is on ANT II g


[05-Apr-25 02:53 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[05-Apr-25 02:54 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Actually


[05-Apr-25 02:54 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I might move my base to KI-401d


[05-Apr-25 02:54 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah man I mean it's almost 30% more


[05-Apr-25 02:55 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[05-Apr-25 08:26 PM] tanda#0000
1) Don't do that


[05-Apr-25 08:27 PM] tanda#0000
2) reach out to the player whose contract you took and let them know the situation, find the solution with that player


[05-Apr-25 08:28 PM] tanda#0000
Easiest thing to do would be have the player send you a contract for you to return the goods that's in the transport package. Then both of you request termination on the shipping contract


[05-Apr-25 08:28 PM] tanda#0000
fulfill the contract for the return of the goods, and you're squared up


[05-Apr-25 08:29 PM] megamint#0000
Yeah. About what I was expecting.  I missed the volume and only looked at the tonnage


[05-Apr-25 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
most packages also simply aren't worth being shipped unless it's a deadhead run without


[05-Apr-25 08:35 PM] jab.sh#0000
another option is to term and split it up


[05-Apr-25 08:36 PM] megamint#0000

I would encourage you to look into the productivity hit you take when buildings start to degrade. Weigh that loss in productivity against the cost savings of using long duration repair cycles.


[05-Apr-25 09:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
theses numbers come from prplan repairs value rate


[05-Apr-25 09:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
I would not have a clue how to


[05-Apr-25 09:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
how can you look at productivity loss depending on % integrity


[05-Apr-25 09:29 PM] vanarazor#0000
I think someone has been sharing a paper about  repairs cost efficiency


[05-Apr-25 09:30 PM] vanarazor#0000
but I can't recall any correlation about producivity loss, there surely is one


[05-Apr-25 09:34 PM] evov#0000
Example - Buildings at 56 days since last repair.
Buildings at 97% condition. Translates into a 4% loss in productivity.

The condition degredation is non-linear. As time since last repair increases.. building condition/performance decreases at a faster rate.

Population efficiency is low because you require more pop than you have provided.

[05-Apr-25 09:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
so condition of the building defines directly efficiency


[05-Apr-25 09:41 PM] evov#0000
You will notice that as the time since last repair increases.... the building will degrade faster. Which effectively increases the time per order.


[05-Apr-25 09:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
so you are telling that some repairs could be worth doing even earlier than what prplan is advising


[05-Apr-25 09:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
depending of the value produced by such building


[05-Apr-25 09:42 PM] evov#0000
This time increase effectively means, per order, the cost component for repairs + consumables increase by x%, and the volume of orders decreases by x%.


[05-Apr-25 09:44 PM] vanarazor#0000
in other words in cost as much to produce as less because of the efficiency loss due to %integrity / condition


[05-Apr-25 09:44 PM] evov#0000
Instead of making 100 units per day, you make 96 units per day. Since consumables and repairs accumulate per day, not per order... each order is effectively costing you more.


[05-Apr-25 09:45 PM] evov#0000
At low % degradation... it's not super important... but the degradation ramps up the longer you leave it.

[05-Apr-25 09:51 PM] evov#0000
I think that would be a good idea. Especially focus on the ones that you have set to >90 days. I would be... surprised.. if 120 days was an ideal repair cycle after considering the profit losses due to degradation.

[05-Apr-25 11:03 PM] manhim#0000
Yup. Like something that I see is that AI has no real context of the whole code base, so sometimes it tries to implement/use new access controls systems (or an alternate one that works on the system, but is not used) that don't talk with the one that should be used and it leads to security gaps.

It's technically not wrong code, but there's still a long way to go before it's viable in the hands of anyone without the proper expertise.

Prunplanner does not take into account the profit loss


[06-Apr-25 01:49 AM] potaterror#0000
Meanwhile I've not even gotten around to figuring out what my actual cumulative burn per day is on most stuff again.


[06-Apr-25 01:50 AM] potaterror#0000
That's why I mostly stick to 42 or 56 days.


[06-Apr-25 01:51 AM] potaterror#0000
Can't be bothered to fiddle with it and see what the actual optimal pick is, but the efficiency falloff grates on me every time I see it.


[06-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
For most base, it is 45 days


[06-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
And for every base 45 days isn't a Bad pick


[06-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
45 or a few days before ofc


[06-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000

[06-Apr-25 01:53 AM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, I see what the big tick points are in PrunPlanner and bump it back to the prior multiple of 7.

wait I just started and am new to the game, does the base degrade when there is no production too ??


[06-Apr-25 10:08 AM] rayjiff#0000
or am I missing something


[06-Apr-25 10:10 AM] igfloz#0000
Only production buildings degrade. Your Core Module, storage and habitations do not


[06-Apr-25 10:10 AM] igfloz#0000
...I'm unsure if industry buildings degrade if there is no production queue (I think not, but haven't proven it)


[06-Apr-25 10:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yes, buildings will degrade over time regardless, if they produce something or not


[06-Apr-25 10:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the same goes for workers - they will consume materials regardless if they produce something


[06-Apr-25 10:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so a base not producing is basically loosing money


[06-Apr-25 10:16 AM] igfloz#0000
I don't think that's right. I've had a base idle for some days and no burn mats were consumed


[06-Apr-25 10:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm pretty sure it's mentioned in the handbook

Efficiency factors :: Prosperous Universe Handbook
General information Each Production Line operates at a certain efficiency when active. Efficiency dictates how long a production order takes to finish: lower efficiency results in longer production times, higher efficiency shortens them. A Production Line‚Äôs current efficiency can be looked up in its Production queue buffer (PRODQ):

[06-Apr-25 10:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
> Note: No production needs to be running for a population to be consuming resources! Idle workforces have the exact same needs as active ones and will still use up consumables in the base‚Äôs inventory.


[06-Apr-25 10:19 AM] igfloz#0000
fair enough

[06-Apr-25 10:26 AM] igfloz#0000
I have a couple hours to wait - I've grabbed  a burn image for Nike. I've cancelled all production for Nike, just have to wait for existing runs to stop - I'll post both burn results later (more for my own clarity really, but I'm sure nothing was burning when Nike was idle in the past)


[06-Apr-25 10:27 AM] igfloz#0000
Nike is easy for me as I have so few lines running on it


[06-Apr-25 10:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm not sure if a few hours are sufficient to test, if a base is deteriorating while it's idle:
> The first full amount of any consumable required for the following 24 hours (e.g. 4 RAT for 100 Pioneers) is claimed by a base‚Äôs population (and thus disappears from the inventory) as soon as the commodity becomes available in the base‚Äôs inventory. The same happens again 24 hours later, again and again until the consumable is used up.


[06-Apr-25 10:32 AM] igfloz#0000
I might wait a little longer then (maybe post tomorrow) - as I said, Nike "was idle" for maybe a week ? and I don't recall any loss of burn mats. I'm just experimenting


[06-Apr-25 10:32 AM] igfloz#0000
Just for the record - this is Nike "running"

idle as in no workforce? no workforce = no cons burn


[06-Apr-25 01:17 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
but if you have workforce and idle production buildings then it does burn cons

Oh hell ! @pxlfox.  I've just remembered ! @optimizedfunction  made me think about it.

I still had a workforce, but I had demolished my un-wanted production buildings. For about a week, I didn't lose any workforce and I didn't burn any mats


[06-Apr-25 02:52 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm thinking if I left it longer, I would have lost workforce due to pop re-structure

they just don't have any negative effect when degraded


[06-Apr-25 05:43 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yea, but it hardly matters since they do their jobs without ever needing repair


[06-Apr-25 05:43 PM] jcheung#0000
it does matter in that the resources returned are different


[06-Apr-25 05:44 PM] jcheung#0000
not having negative production effects and not degrading are similar, but not the same

Upgrading an LCB to a HCB seems odd. I don't think it returns the replaced parts back to you does it? Just keep the LCB, and ADD a HCB to your fleet when you can afford it imo. My stock availability as at a few days ago -

[07-Apr-25 03:00 AM] jcheung#0000
oh shit is that out now?


[07-Apr-25 03:00 AM] jcheung#0000
hmmm


[07-Apr-25 03:00 AM] jcheung#0000
do bundles only offer convienence or do they also package better


[07-Apr-25 03:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
They package slightly better, if I remember molps post in the forums correctly


[07-Apr-25 03:35 AM] realharvey#0000
it was worse in the first itteration. But they adjusted the values, not sure if its still more heavy/bulky or not. In the first preview it was more bulky+heavy


[07-Apr-25 03:49 AM] jcheung#0000
fuck that


[07-Apr-25 03:50 AM] jcheung#0000
there would be no reason to use it if it both required fab time and was worse


[07-Apr-25 03:57 AM] realharvey#0000
√ç dont know... there might be people chasing that industry and buy stuff on the CX package it and resell it for a profit


[07-Apr-25 03:57 AM] realharvey#0000
and lazy people will buy it


[07-Apr-25 03:58 AM] realharvey#0000
I  am lazy I pay more for convinience


[07-Apr-25 04:05 AM] jcheung#0000
convenience, yes. but if it takes more room to ship after being processed again, then absolutely not worth it


[07-Apr-25 04:39 AM] realharvey#0000
its still just 1 item you put X Amount of in your ship instead at least 5 items with different X amounts you have to keep in mind


[07-Apr-25 04:40 AM] realharvey#0000
If I'd produce a lot of consumables I would have considered creating my own Shipping HUB


[07-Apr-25 04:44 AM] evov#0000
I think it makes things like contracting Consume supply runs more viable. I think LM adds for consumables start to make sense. I think it will make more sense if/when they put in shopfronts.

But as it is... I'm not rushing out to put down a new Manufacturing base. But we'll see how it goes.


[07-Apr-25 06:10 AM] tanda#0000
I could definitely be convinced to be a purchaser of these packages, but I'm in the same boat about not rushing to put a Manufacturing base down for it


[07-Apr-25 08:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
what should I do about the electronica population issue (big lack of SETs) ? I havent seen any action by the goverment at all, and the number of open jobs will likely only rise while immigration/education all gets turned straight into TECs


[07-Apr-25 08:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
im loosing quite alot of money so I am a little annoyed


[07-Apr-25 08:12 AM] realharvey#0000
Well there was no issue before multiple bases where plopped down and added 2000 open Set jobs. So this is no ongoing issue... yet.


[07-Apr-25 08:12 AM] realharvey#0000
Gov should queue up atleast one programm to deal with this and they have 4 more days to deal with it.


[07-Apr-25 08:17 AM] realharvey#0000
Hey @archielvahr , could you maybe give martinc1194 a nudge that Electronica needs a little push for the next POPR?


[07-Apr-25 08:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
I hope they do cuz iv alr lost probably 150k+ üòî


[07-Apr-25 08:20 AM] realharvey#0000
you should get used to this. It's not always easy to deal with Population shortages. When multiple people plot down bases at the same time on a planet there is not much you can do. Not even programms will fix all your issues


[07-Apr-25 08:21 AM] pagy1234#0000

[07-Apr-25 08:21 AM] pagy1234#0000

I have just had a couple of good planet in a row I guess


[07-Apr-25 08:21 AM] realharvey#0000
my last 3 bases required 4-5 POPR's to get full pop


[07-Apr-25 08:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
bro wth


[07-Apr-25 08:22 AM] realharvey#0000
and with them being techs and engineers the loss in revenue is way higher

üëç 

[07-Apr-25 08:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
the most recent base I just put down didnt even need to wait for POPR because there was so much unemployment that it instantly got filled lol


[07-Apr-25 08:23 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah on big planets it is often pretty easy. PIO is always never a problem. One POPR usually gets you full pop


[07-Apr-25 08:23 AM] realharvey#0000
SET takes on average 1-2 maybe 3 for full


[07-Apr-25 08:24 AM] realharvey#0000
but that is very dependend on how many Open Jobs and how big that planet is


[07-Apr-25 08:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
electronica is decently big I thought


[07-Apr-25 08:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
but there are now ~2k open jobs, with about 700 being mine


[07-Apr-25 08:28 AM] laaxus#0000
it is


[07-Apr-25 08:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah thats why im wondering why its taking such a while to fill pop


[07-Apr-25 08:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
maybe im just not used to it


[07-Apr-25 08:32 AM] realharvey#0000
2k open Jobs is quite a lot. More than 2 Bases. That will take 2-3 POPR's to be fully filled


[07-Apr-25 08:55 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
well, 2k SET is just 6.66% of total current SET pop so it should take like 1 POPR if the happiness is pumped to 82%


[07-Apr-25 08:56 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
but I imagine its hard to do that on a big planet like electronica


[07-Apr-25 09:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep I pinged him. I think a Festival 3 will get us about 5k more settlers in the next POPI so it'll cover the deficit entirely


[07-Apr-25 09:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah if you notice a planet is gonna be short and you are building a big base, try to hit up the governor or an OOG member who is an MP on the planet.  @martin1194  is an MP and he is in ADI also


[07-Apr-25 09:36 AM] pagy1234#0000

the question is : did it increase enough


[07-Apr-25 10:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
give it some time - seems like norwick and maybe other FP planets are having POPI issues, so they may not be running at 100%

Somewhat, and it's in the process of increasing -- I'm pumping TECs on AJ-293a because someone's plopping down an IVP farm there, and I imagine it isn't the only place.

would it be worth selling agraculture ingredients?


[07-Apr-25 04:22 PM] harucyber#0000
or should i process into rations


[07-Apr-25 04:23 PM] laaxus#0000
Start with producing her


[07-Apr-25 04:25 PM] laaxus#0000
Her is really profitable atm


[07-Apr-25 04:25 PM] laaxus#0000
So just produce that, sell it on the cx, repeat


[07-Apr-25 04:25 PM] laaxus#0000
Later, you could refine it into fim


[07-Apr-25 04:26 PM] laaxus#0000
Tho, not at the start


[07-Apr-25 04:26 PM] laaxus#0000
You should build a full 500 base first


[07-Apr-25 04:28 PM] laaxus#0000
Ah wait


[07-Apr-25 04:28 PM] laaxus#0000
You don't have basic, don't you


[07-Apr-25 04:28 PM] laaxus#0000
So we can't give you capital in any form


[07-Apr-25 04:29 PM] laaxus#0000
Her, while the most profitable, is the most expensive


[07-Apr-25 04:29 PM] laaxus#0000
So you might not have enough capital to buy the input good

[07-Apr-25 05:25 PM] vanarazor#0000
But ddt base is expensive as well


[07-Apr-25 05:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
Build some capital and as soon as you can a Her base and let‚Äôs say  5-10 days of mats including DDT, go for it!!

Hopefully someone else can counterpoint my counsel and give you even better advice

start with 3 PACs? and maybe run SET/TEC supplies


[07-Apr-25 08:05 PM] tanda#0000
I did some numbers a while back and 3 PACs can supply my whole empire for PIO

If he put a bid higher than market price, more people will sell into his bid  than people buying at ask


[08-Apr-25 01:40 AM] jcheung#0000
Two things.
1) if there isn't a MM capping the price upwards, someone simply just buys through your ask, and buys high enough that nobody sells into your bid anymore
2) someone dumps a stockpile or brings to market production they weren't listing before, causing a general price decrease

does MEA really have enough production for that?


[08-Apr-25 12:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
I know alot of people set up bases for IVPs and whatever, but Norwick still has pop issues, barely anyone moved onto SE-110a, and tbh idk any other food industry planets


[08-Apr-25 12:42 PM] potaterror#0000
I'm no analyst, but looking at the 90 day leaderboard vs 7 day and the fact that I know of 1 IVP base coming online that isn't even someone on the board, I'm inclined to think so.


[08-Apr-25 12:44 PM] potaterror#0000
IVPs don't have a ton of flexibility, so I'd say that's going to have some people staying in the market.

When you say same node, do you mean adding a permit to an existing base? Or making a new base in the same system as an existing one (like SE-110 for example?)

I don't know what your plans would be for SE-110e, but lots of people get water from ISA (SE-110c), grow crops on SE-110b, and Bake them into food on SE-110a (or variants of that).

[08-Apr-25 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
Technically the letters (SE, ZV) you see on the map are sectors, which are groups of systems


[08-Apr-25 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
So there‚Äôs SE-110, SE-052, SE-648 - all their own systems with their own planets


[08-Apr-25 03:34 PM] jab.sh#0000
no, there's nothing wrong with being on multiple planets in the same sector/system, and it can make logistics easier.


[08-Apr-25 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Well


[08-Apr-25 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
If you're feeding one planet from another, there's many cases where it's more consistent and faster to send to/from a neighboring system (one jump)


[08-Apr-25 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
Same system however, allows you to use a STL ship which is an overall cheaper ship

Any tips for shipping?


[08-Apr-25 07:29 PM] megamint#0000
Besides checking volumes and weight? (I messed that up a couple days ago)


[08-Apr-25 07:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
just make sure that your fuel cost is as small as possible


[08-Apr-25 07:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
shipping doesnt have the largest margins, so every bit you save on fuel is cash straight into your pocket


[08-Apr-25 07:34 PM] megamint#0000
I hear that. I ran a couple "fast runs" and immediately regretted that decision


[08-Apr-25 07:34 PM] pagy1234#0000
also, if you want to ship between CX's, you can use this website to find trades : https://fio.fnar.net/tradefinder


[08-Apr-25 07:34 PM] megamint#0000
That's funny. I already do!


[08-Apr-25 07:34 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh lol, nice :D

not much leaving Antares today


[08-Apr-25 07:36 PM] pagy1234#0000
there are some trades that could be made with ALO


[08-Apr-25 07:37 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
OR! make so much fuel you don't need to care about fuel anymore


[08-Apr-25 07:37 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
wont help with turning a profit (since using the fuel still creates the opportunity cost of selling the fuel instead of using it) but can definitely help out corp members


[08-Apr-25 07:38 PM] pagy1234#0000
this one is a great trade, look into it, lots of ALO orders on both sides.

I'm not fully sure how to read the table here


[08-Apr-25 07:40 PM] megamint#0000
I see that ALO is trading, but I'm not certain what that means or how i can benefit


[08-Apr-25 07:40 PM] pagy1234#0000
buy at AI1 for 114/u, and sell at CI1 for 150/u


[08-Apr-25 07:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
column 1 is origin
2 is destination
3 is mat
4 is origin price /u
5 is probably number of units at price in 4
6 is dest price /u
7 is probably number of units at price in 6


[08-Apr-25 07:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
8 and 9 i dont know


[08-Apr-25 07:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
10 is profit per 500t


[08-Apr-25 07:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
actually 8 is price difference /u


[08-Apr-25 07:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
9 is still unclear


[08-Apr-25 07:43 PM] megamint#0000
for example AI1 to NC1 would be a good bet (since IC1 only has 32 needed at the 220 price) correct?


[08-Apr-25 07:43 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[08-Apr-25 07:44 PM] megamint#0000
Ah, but this gets into the mixed currency problem I was just askking about too

its pretty easy to convert currency now using IDC.


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] megamint#0000
is IDC a tool?


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
just buy IDC at 15400 at the CX and ship it to the other CX and sell at 15300


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
its a material


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
it trades at the MM prices (MM = market maker aka the NPC orders)


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
you can trade stuff back, or if you have PRO, then you can use `FX`


[08-Apr-25 07:48 PM] megamint#0000
is it a material that has the same value everywhere?


[08-Apr-25 07:49 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
pretty much yes since it trades at 15400/15300 nearly everywhere

why is ALO so cheap at ANT


[08-Apr-25 07:54 PM] megamint#0000
probably because there is a system right next door that has ALO planets

[09-Apr-25 02:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
good balance of price & reducing load on your FTL ships


[09-Apr-25 02:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
but it really depends on what you wanna do there


[09-Apr-25 02:02 PM] potaterror#0000
Oh yeah, I forgot we were talking about that system specifically. WCB would be a poor choice there, I think.


[09-Apr-25 02:03 PM] jab.sh#0000
500/500 STL, what is that like $2m?


[09-Apr-25 02:04 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm at the point where I'd trade efficiency/price for convenience. I'd be fine with just getting a normal 2k2k and have it sit in that system.


[09-Apr-25 02:05 PM] potaterror#0000
Something around there.


[09-Apr-25 02:06 PM] potaterror#0000
Oh wow


[09-Apr-25 02:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah around 2M, maybe less if you go with a GEN


[09-Apr-25 02:07 PM] potaterror#0000
Actually, a WCB over a MCB only adds 350k. Uses the same amount of hull plates and SSCs as a MCB.


[09-Apr-25 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
but if you've already got a large FTL fleet, you probably don't need it

if anyones interested


[09-Apr-25 02:19 PM] potaterror#0000
Nah, because WH space does weird level skips. Like 8-9 doesn't get you more space, just additional units that can be rented.


[09-Apr-25 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you want to upgrade it up to 2k worth per person, Phobos will pay for it, just send me a bill


[09-Apr-25 02:20 PM] jab.sh#0000
oh weird


[09-Apr-25 02:20 PM] jab.sh#0000
like 2k per base?

That's what it's already at. =p

[09-Apr-25 02:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
that sounds needlessly complex. they should just let everyone rent the max warehouse, and increase by 500 each level.


[09-Apr-25 02:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
ah I see


[09-Apr-25 02:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
well I want to contribute to the Anterean infra upgrades project üôÇ


[09-Apr-25 02:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
so if I upgrade the warehouse right now, it wouldn't even give me more space?


[09-Apr-25 02:27 PM] potaterror#0000
It sort of makes sense early on. The first few levels could conceivably be filled and need a total unit upgrade.


[09-Apr-25 02:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
it would let more people rent units, which there's already more units than available plots, so that literally does nothing.


[09-Apr-25 02:27 PM] potaterror#0000
By like level 5 it just isn't going to happen though.


[09-Apr-25 02:27 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, you'd have to upgrade to level 10 to see a space boost.


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] potaterror#0000
Level 9 isn't going to do anything but raise the available unit total to, uh...2250.


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
10? sheesh


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
oh it's at 8


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
I see now.


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah. I'd be surprised if max total units ever gets hit.


[09-Apr-25 02:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
it literally can't


[09-Apr-25 02:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
423 plots * 4 per plot is only 1692


[09-Apr-25 02:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
when there's 1800 units available now


[09-Apr-25 02:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
unless the planet got overfilled of course


[09-Apr-25 02:29 PM] potaterror#0000
It can in the early levels, but past 4 or so it isn't likely.


[09-Apr-25 02:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
well I sent the governor a DM


[09-Apr-25 02:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, WAR, POPI buildings, even ADMs maybe. Anywhere in ANT


[09-Apr-25 02:32 PM] potaterror#0000
I'd be surprised if they've got the cheddar to throw at it, but it can't hurt to ask.


[09-Apr-25 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Phobos has more cheddar than can be reasonably spent, so please help me spend it üòÜ


[09-Apr-25 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh Griff is already at 4 units per company. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[09-Apr-25 02:33 PM] potaterror#0000
Well, the question is whether a WH above 2K is worth the spend even in cash-rich Phobos terms.


[09-Apr-25 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not opposed to adding more, it gets a little expensive, but like I said... lots of money


[09-Apr-25 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe we should consider 5 units the new max üòÑ


[09-Apr-25 02:35 PM] potaterror#0000
I'd say to take planetary use into consideration. What's Griff make a lot of, CL?


[09-Apr-25 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of AML products too, which are heavy.


[09-Apr-25 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heph is at 5k/5k, and my warehouse is full.. and I have a HCB parked on Heph also just for storage üòì


[09-Apr-25 02:36 PM] potaterror#0000
Probably makes sense to bump that up to 3K, meaning a WH can service a WCB.


[09-Apr-25 02:37 PM] potaterror#0000
If it's a real hot planet then yeah, 5K may actually be worth it with the HCBs


[09-Apr-25 02:37 PM] jab.sh#0000
the griff base I'm supplying is making NS


[09-Apr-25 02:37 PM] jab.sh#0000
and I'm always fighting with space issues


[09-Apr-25 02:37 PM] jab.sh#0000
LST is so heavy


[09-Apr-25 02:38 PM] jab.sh#0000
and then H is so voluminous


[09-Apr-25 02:38 PM] potaterror#0000
LST is another that would make me say 3K is reasonable for WCB reasons.


[09-Apr-25 02:38 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
in that case, can Phobos fund 298k to the government of LS-746b so it can repay me for the WAR upgrade? I had raised taxes and WAR fees to cover the expenses. I reimbursed 50% of the cost since the government earned enough. I am sure everyone would appreciate it if the taxes can be dropped üôÇ


[09-Apr-25 02:38 PM] jab.sh#0000
I could fund it, I just wanted to see what "best practice" is.


[09-Apr-25 02:40 PM] jab.sh#0000
according to [this](https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-projects/index.html), 9 does go to 5 and then 11 goes to 6.


[09-Apr-25 02:41 PM] potaterror#0000
Oh, you're right.


[09-Apr-25 02:41 PM] potaterror#0000
I didn't actually look at the per company column on my chart, I just assumed that nobody'd upgraded it past the last tick.


[09-Apr-25 02:42 PM] jab.sh#0000
so we need just over 3x the current cost to get to 11 right?

what's 1-7 cost?
just over $2m by my math.


[09-Apr-25 02:47 PM] potaterror#0000
Still, for prosperous ANT, bumping beyond that may not be a bad call.


[09-Apr-25 02:48 PM] potaterror#0000
Probably about 2M total.

[10-Apr-25 11:32 AM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
Any recommended planets to settle on?
Current business model is pure shipping, currently applying for a grant to build a SF Refining Plant at my current base on Katoa (UV-351a), with a second base planned on Unamed (CB-282d) for Hydrogen Production.

I'm am thinking about whether to consider FF Refining, but nothing is set in stone at the moment.
I am also trying to figure out whether it would be better to:
1) extract TS and turn it into HE3 | from Avalon (VH-331g)
2) extract HE3 directly | from Hermes (KI-448b)
3) Import HE3 from the Ex | (BEN or ANT [Depending on finances] )


[10-Apr-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
The system with romulon?


[10-Apr-25 11:35 AM] jab.sh#0000
depends on which industry you want to go with, but prunplanner lets you filter by COGC and sort by distance to ANT or another planet, probably a good place to start. once you get a candidate planet you'll want to make sure it has the population to support your base


[10-Apr-25 11:35 AM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
Romulon?


[10-Apr-25 11:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think I spelled it right


[10-Apr-25 11:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Romulus sorry

[10-Apr-25 03:03 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
consider extracting HE3 on Orm, H on CB-282d and join me on UV-795d for refining it into FF


[10-Apr-25 03:04 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
UV-795d is also just 2 jumps from BEN


[10-Apr-25 04:09 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
Perhaps another time, I'm trying to get two bases built (up) by applying for the grants and I only have 2 Base Permits.


[10-Apr-25 04:13 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
But for when such time comes, is mining Gal on Katoa any good?


[10-Apr-25 05:22 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
its okay


[10-Apr-25 05:23 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
you can have a hybrid base mining GAL and refining SF on katoa


[10-Apr-25 05:26 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
I plan on importing GAL from Ben and importing H and AMM from my (planned) Romulus base.

[10-Apr-25 05:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
you are aiming at a full 13 REF SF base?


[10-Apr-25 05:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
if you wanna just mine GAL then you can go to KW-976c


[10-Apr-25 05:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
its expensive to build on but 1 base can support 2x  13 REF bases.


[10-Apr-25 05:27 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
I have 12 REF on Katoa


[10-Apr-25 05:28 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[10-Apr-25 05:32 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
I have a Plot of Land, a Core Module and 2 Starter Ships to my name + currencies + various commodities


[10-Apr-25 05:33 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
- You wish to make a 13 REF base on katoa to make SF and FF
- You plan to make a Romulus base (which is DEEP in ANT) to supply yourself with AMM and H.
- You plan to import GAL from BEN CX to your Katoa base


[10-Apr-25 05:34 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
That is the jist of it, and subject to change depending on where and what I end up doing in Insitor


[10-Apr-25 05:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Okay


[10-Apr-25 05:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I can help you plan better though


[10-Apr-25 05:35 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
If you want to supply your Katoa base, make H on CB-282d, buy GAL and AMM on BEN CX


[10-Apr-25 05:35 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
that will disqualify you from the AGP though


[10-Apr-25 05:35 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Romulus is _far_ and that will engage both your starter ships and then some


[10-Apr-25 05:36 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
+ CB-282d has many people who ship H from the planet to BEN/Katoa all the time


[10-Apr-25 05:39 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
Conjecture, let's say I qualify for the AGP and receive the materials & funding
Would I need to build the entire base immediately,
or could I build the Core Module and deposit everything into the base storage and resume building it another time?


[10-Apr-25 05:40 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I think thats technically acceptable but stepping around the program requirements like that is probably not gonna be appreciated


[10-Apr-25 05:41 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
You could still make the H base and sell H on ANT CX


[10-Apr-25 05:42 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
I would need to get meself another ship, or talk with my Contract Manager(?) about getting it consistently shipped, but possible


[10-Apr-25 05:43 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
that will qualify for the grant, i mean, free money is free money :pepe_shrug:  and i understand


[10-Apr-25 05:43 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000
Since I am getting AIC by doing shipping in Ant at the moment


[10-Apr-25 05:44 PM] kyubi_otsutsuki_2071#0000

[10-Apr-25 05:46 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
its a mega system with a lot of useful planets


[10-Apr-25 05:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
apparently AGP doesn't have a maximum bases requirement @kyubi_otsutsuki_2071 so you can expand in ANT later


[10-Apr-25 05:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
BEST grant has a maximum bases requirement


[10-Apr-25 05:47 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

mid way of doing so, need to get a plan fully developed first, that allows for me to get and properly use all three Grants within each one's original intentions.

it's from RPrun or PMMG

[10-Apr-25 11:18 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Will the planned gateways fit 5k5k ships?


[10-Apr-25 11:18 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
If no, then should we be going ham on 5k5ks?


[10-Apr-25 11:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
With max size upgrades I think?


[10-Apr-25 11:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
Aka none of the planned gates


[10-Apr-25 11:20 PM] jcheung#0000
i mean you'll still have at least two ships that fit üòÑ


[10-Apr-25 11:20 PM] jcheung#0000
also with how big they are they can afford to take the slower route


[10-Apr-25 11:22 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
So what i am hearing is i am gonna get fked


[10-Apr-25 11:22 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

Not like gateways are actually gonna get released at this rate anyways


[10-Apr-25 11:22 PM] jcheung#0000
gate release will be sometime between now and the heat death of the universe so you have plenty of time

Idk, development pace is glacial though. I don't really expect them soon


[10-Apr-25 11:32 PM] jcheung#0000
imo...
packages was dumb
multi conts was a hack job. appreciated, but it's some hacky shit i would have expected from rprun
gifting is... eh. dunno how i feel about that yet


[10-Apr-25 11:33 PM] .shiva.#0000
Yeah agreed. Gifting is also mostly pointless imo


[10-Apr-25 11:33 PM] .shiva.#0000

[10-Apr-25 11:37 PM] jcheung#0000
i see a couple good use cases for gifting


[10-Apr-25 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
1) gift one day, someone gets to start ship upgrades and HQ upgrades that they pre-positioned
2) gift one day, give them stuff
3) retirement


[10-Apr-25 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
but


[10-Apr-25 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
since you're not allowed to trade for it


[10-Apr-25 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
that's about it

it takes the bid price, which makes sense

couldnt you gift 4 days, and the other person gifts 3 backs?


[11-Apr-25 07:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
I feel like molp and the other devs might have gotten a bit overwhelmed with the gateways thing. they promised alot but since people already started gathering hundreds of millions, they cant really change much without people getting angry. so instead of going back on their promises, they just go and do small things for a while.


[11-Apr-25 08:08 AM] tanda#0000
Gateways is just a huge project. Molp came back a few different times with updates basically saying "it's more complex than we anticipated"


[11-Apr-25 08:28 AM] laaxus#0000

[12-Apr-25 12:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
The currently planned gateways won't fit a 5k ship. It would limit their range, and thus , from what we understand, their speed. The alternate routes that support 5k ships would be 50% slower than the initially planned routes.


[12-Apr-25 12:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
We're anticipating a pretty huge speed increase, so 2k ships though the network we have planned will be a ton of extra shipping


[12-Apr-25 12:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
It could theoretically be changed- there are some pieces of the puzzle missing still- what the final speed through the gate is, mostly.

is that a specialised ship for chemicals shipping

You can get a "standard" LCB ship for a little more than 4 mil I think


[12-Apr-25 04:18 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah but a "standard" LCB is not going to have a "_Hyper-power Reactor_" or a " _Glass-based STL Engine_"


[12-Apr-25 04:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
nah, just need something fast for small shipping

[12-Apr-25 09:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
theres not much demand, and will 21 units of each per day, il probably lower the prices a little


[12-Apr-25 09:49 AM] laaxus#0000

oh yeah i get what you mean


[12-Apr-25 09:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
might take a little while though


[12-Apr-25 09:50 AM] tanda#0000
and it also can encourage new bases that will consume the product


[12-Apr-25 09:50 AM] igfloz#0000
I'd suggest more people will start taking it....... with each of them being low supply , I feel most people will just spin up their own internal resources


[12-Apr-25 09:50 AM] laaxus#0000
I could provide a bid for you to sell into


[12-Apr-25 09:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
I aim to eventually use some amount of it myself aswell, so it should be alright in the long run


[12-Apr-25 09:51 AM] laaxus#0000
Ofc the bid won't be as profitable as selling at ask


[12-Apr-25 09:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
if you need it then that would be great, although there are quite some already


[12-Apr-25 09:51 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't need it at all

I see that you already have some orders on PSL and PSM though, then allocator has a bit one on PSS so it should be fine

I put a bid on pss


[12-Apr-25 09:55 AM] laaxus#0000
Once those bids are filled, I'll resell them at a slightly higher price


[12-Apr-25 09:55 AM] evov#0000
I was a net buyer of most PPF outputs for a while. I have since built a second PPF base. I suspect this will have a net effect on CX demand for PPF outputs.


[12-Apr-25 09:55 AM] laaxus#0000
Feel free to sell at ask tho


[12-Apr-25 09:56 AM] laaxus#0000
If you stopped buying PPF product, this change things

[12-Apr-25 09:58 AM] evov#0000
Not sure if my 2nd PFF base will cover all of my needs. But it will naturally have an impact on how much I look to the CX to cover.


[12-Apr-25 10:04 AM] evov#0000
I've always had 1 base producing these things, but prices have risen by roughly 50% over the past 6months. Generally, I find that if there's something I need/use, and the market can't supply suitable volume at suitable prices, I'll make it myself. These items definitely fell into this category.


[12-Apr-25 10:20 AM] igfloz#0000
It was lack of permit & capital to "make it myself" that led me to bring this to the wider group, I'm kinda glad I did - Even if @laaxus re-sells and churns a small arbitrage profit, I'd swallow that over spinning up and managing it myself


[12-Apr-25 11:15 AM] tanda#0000
Does anyone see any demand in the market for additional TEC capable chemistry planets? I'm looking at upgrading YK-266c to support TEC and want to gauge interest


[12-Apr-25 11:47 AM] evov#0000
If I'm going to develop a new planet, it's likely to be either Chem / Manufacturing or Electronics. I think there's reasonably high demand for Chem planets.


[12-Apr-25 11:48 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, and YK is pretty underutilized currently IMO, but I'm wondering about upgrading it to support TEC, since it already supports PIO and SET

At the moment there's currently no demands on pop for that planet. So immigration programs are open. All the new bases/pop demands for the planets in this project are managed here ->

[12-Apr-25 12:22 PM] evov#0000
The other Chem planet I manage seems to constantly have demand for ENG. So in general, I think it makes sense for Chem planets to aim for being capable of supporting ENG imo.

NL doesnt sell too fast


[13-Apr-25 04:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
only about 100-150 units look to be selling per day, so you 28 units per day production will have a significant impact on the market


[13-Apr-25 04:24 AM] laaxus#0000
NL will definitly sell if not too expensive


[13-Apr-25 04:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
there is also the risk of piling up stock on the CX since sales are sporadic (EX: there hasnt been a sale of NL is 2 days)


[13-Apr-25 04:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
make sure you know what you are doing with that base, you already have very spread out bases, and spreadin them out even more will not help yout logistics


[13-Apr-25 04:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
you could move that base to Hephaestus so its close to you harmonia base

in case anyone's interested, I need some inter-CX shipping. Pays 30k per load

40k and i'll ship it from BEN üëÄ

one shipment is away, i would've fit more but those were 3k1k and I had an HCB üôÇ

awesome, thank you


[13-Apr-25 03:26 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Why? Just make 1k t/m contracts


[13-Apr-25 03:26 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
That way all kind of non starter ships can ship your stuff


[13-Apr-25 03:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
WCB, VCB, HCB


[13-Apr-25 03:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
And LCB ofc


[13-Apr-25 03:27 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I always make 1k t/m conts now to make sure anyone can ship my things


[13-Apr-25 03:31 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Plus making multiple shipping ads on the LM is super easy

A full SME base eats up around 350 ore per day


[14-Apr-25 02:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
market provides for a week with reasonable prices


[14-Apr-25 02:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
800 is roughly the 50k profit/day mark (with CX ore at 140/u)


[14-Apr-25 02:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
950 / FE when FEO rises up to 250/u


[14-Apr-25 02:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and 1,000 when FEO goes up to the currently highest ask of 300


[14-Apr-25 02:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Thinking about it - it‚Äôs not too bad, but I think CX can‚Äôt handle more then 2 full SME bases atm


[14-Apr-25 02:55 AM] evov#0000
And how much supply of new FE to the market do you think the demand side of the CX can handle?


[14-Apr-25 02:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I dont have a good feeling for that, since Im currently not trading with FE. And I‚Äôm not really good in interpreting order books and price charts üòÖ


[14-Apr-25 02:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Let me look at the data‚Ä¶


[14-Apr-25 02:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We have an average of 300 FE traded per day in the last 14 days


[14-Apr-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Price went mostly horizontal in the last 30d and had a spike yesterday, probably when TRU noticed the deficit


[14-Apr-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We have a slight under supply in the books, but nothing major


[14-Apr-25 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So maybe 1 base would be sufficient, I guess


[14-Apr-25 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
2 would probably start to bring the price down


[14-Apr-25 03:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
A SME base can churn out 200 FE / day

So
Yes, rprun is written in Vue, but fun fact: in the beginning, I was developing it in React. I have quite some experience in Vue (one of the developers of Antimatter Dimensions, https://store.steampowered.com/app/1399720/Antimatter_Dimensions/), but I wanted to try something new, so I picked React because the PrUn itself is a React app. Idk, it was a weak point, but I went with it. After a month, I figured out that either I was doing something wrong with React, or React itself was giving me shit, because the code was getting more and more complex without much reason. So, I switched to Vue, and many things got simpler. In the current state, refined prun is not a pure Vue app but rather a soup of direct DOM manipulations via mini-features (like item icons) and a multitude of Vue mini-apps (mainly XIT commands). It won't give you a good example of how Vue apps should be made if you are looking for that.

Eh, so I take it back then. Sounds like it would be working in vue without any actual useful experience in how vue apps are typically deisgned. Less than ideal to hear; too bad I wasn't around when you first started it, I could've helped you figure out what the issue you were facing at that time was, no worries though.


[14-Apr-25 02:18 PM] harkenn#0000
But I appreciate the update, and will still plan on taking a look around at how its all tied together to see if / how I might contribute, having not worked in Vue for any large projects.

> Why React doesn't accept an array of strings as a class in jsx???

JSX itself doesn't allow it; and as to why that's the case I've never bothered to look into the various proposals over the years where facebook engineers of the time debated the implementation.

The typical solution is to use the `classnames` package, which adds other rather useful features like conditionally applying classes via in-lined logic.


[14-Apr-25 02:23 PM] harkenn#0000

Anyone looking into getting out of IDC, do you guys want to make WAI instead?


[14-Apr-25 06:45 PM] tanda#0000
SD bases are way cheap, and I have SEs on both Malahat and Phobos


[14-Apr-25 06:45 PM] tanda#0000
could do a vertical integration on those planets and churn out some WAI for sale


[14-Apr-25 07:04 PM] zillatron#0000
Feels like a lottt of people are going to get into WAI (which is good, just not for me) :blobsweats:


[14-Apr-25 07:05 PM] tanda#0000
it's one of the few ways that makes sense. And the universe is going to need a lot of it


[14-Apr-25 07:05 PM] tanda#0000
another way is going to SNMs, at least


[14-Apr-25 07:09 PM] zillatron#0000
i should have said i dont have any IDC/EDC bases so I'm probably not the target for this question haha


[14-Apr-25 07:10 PM] zillatron#0000
there's lots more viable options now. its a really good change imo


[14-Apr-25 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm in the middle of seeing how I can repurpose my current bases or pivot to a different production system


[14-Apr-25 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
I love it, I don't see why anyone quit over these changes >.>

oh, huh. WAI isn't that hard to make iirc


[14-Apr-25 07:44 PM] tanda#0000
no, but a full base of WAI needs 5 feeder bases, lol


[14-Apr-25 07:44 PM] tanda#0000

[14-Apr-25 07:44 PM] jcheung#0000

[14-Apr-25 07:45 PM] jcheung#0000
you don't have to do pure WAI

sure, you could make IDC, but then we're back at square one


[14-Apr-25 07:45 PM] jcheung#0000
there's some other electronic stuff that you can make without feeder base


[14-Apr-25 07:45 PM] jcheung#0000
that you need for WAI


[14-Apr-25 07:45 PM] potaterror#0000
I started as a WIN producer and then kind of slid into MEA out of circumstance and was in the process of dropping a couple IDC bases before downsizing some of my food operations, just to keep a low-volatility income stream ripping.

[14-Apr-25 07:45 PM] tanda#0000
This is why I have EDC bases


[14-Apr-25 07:46 PM] tanda#0000
so if things get slow I can just sell some EDC to keep solvent


[14-Apr-25 07:46 PM] potaterror#0000
So now I'm debating whether it is worth it to just do that or do something else, but even after my reorganization I'll be making enough MEA/WIN to keep 3 SL bases rolling.


[14-Apr-25 07:47 PM] tanda#0000
I really do think WAI is probably going to sell pretty well due to how many of these MMs it's part of


[14-Apr-25 07:47 PM] tanda#0000
but it's also not going to stay as expensive as it is right now either

[14-Apr-25 07:57 PM] evov#0000
I'm not sure if that's true that we're about to see a massive spike in WAI demand... but if it is... I won't complain.

I'm sure you've taken a look at the new top MM's by now?


[14-Apr-25 07:58 PM] tanda#0000
Most of them (barring drones) use WAI at some stage


[14-Apr-25 07:59 PM] evov#0000
I did take a look at them.
From my perspective, AIR is the only relevant one that uses WAI.


[14-Apr-25 07:59 PM] finestone#0000
easy RED flip if you 6m+ sittinf around EVO


[14-Apr-25 07:59 PM] evov#0000
The thing with MM's .... due to unlimited demand, what ends  up happening is everyone flocks to the top 2 or 3 options. Everything below that.. the MM price is largely irrelevant over time.


[14-Apr-25 08:00 PM] jcheung#0000
well, if the top 2-3 are complex chains


[14-Apr-25 08:00 PM] tanda#0000

[14-Apr-25 08:01 PM] evov#0000
I think  (again, just a very preliminary look) - AIR looks interesting, drones look interesting. LOG and Capacitor banks look like they might be interesting.


[14-Apr-25 08:01 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I was looking at LOG but got intimidated by BMF, lol


[14-Apr-25 08:01 PM] tanda#0000
halfway tempted to just start making BMF to sell, honestly


[14-Apr-25 08:02 PM] evov#0000
LOG and Capacitor banks haven't changed. They've always been "viable" imo. But with IDC/EDC getting removed... they just float closer to the top by proxy

Experimenting with Gov reporting tools.  Also - shameless plug.. if anyone is interested in putting down a base in the IA-151/158 project, hit me up.

Basically I wanted to make it easy for people to see which planets have ample spare pop just waiting for someone to give them jobs. And which planets are still filling pop demands ( and would not be a good idea to join right now )

there's also some other funny processes. We dump rawdata onto a fileserver in excel to import that into another database and then create a report and dump that one in an excelfile on the fileserver again

exactly

i got hired as "hybrid" during the pandemic but was basically full remote until recently


[16-Apr-25 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
just went into the office whenever there were meetings there that I should attend


[16-Apr-25 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I don't live too far away (and am moving much closer) so it's not really a big inconvenience for me, I just don't like the messaging


[16-Apr-25 12:11 PM] jcheung#0000
call/text can be intercepted more easily than authenticator app


[16-Apr-25 12:13 PM] potaterror#0000
Sure, and I don't have a problem with the fact that it's an app, I have a problem with the fact that they casually assume I'm willing to run anything work-related on personal hardware and unwilling to budge when I say that I won't.


[16-Apr-25 12:14 PM] jab.sh#0000
is it a specific app or will any TOTP app work?


[16-Apr-25 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
that's fair


[16-Apr-25 12:14 PM] jab.sh#0000
although I do have okta on my personal phone mostly for convenience.


[16-Apr-25 12:14 PM] potaterror#0000
Pretty sure any TOTP app will work, it's mostly just a principle thing as I've said.


[16-Apr-25 12:15 PM] jab.sh#0000
well if it's just one more code in a sea of codes üòõ


[16-Apr-25 12:15 PM] jab.sh#0000

[16-Apr-25 12:15 PM] jab.sh#0000
I used to use authenticator plus


[16-Apr-25 12:17 PM] jab.sh#0000
I get your principle, but if you already have a TOTP app set up and you're just adding one code, that feels different to me than installing "work apps"


[16-Apr-25 12:17 PM] jab.sh#0000
idk maybe I'm more lax

[16-Apr-25 12:53 PM] potaterror#0000
It's effectively the same. I just recently switched to GrapheneOS and prior to that didn't really treat my phone as a trusted device, so I wasn't doing anything on it that required any degree of authentication anyway.


[16-Apr-25 01:03 PM] potaterror#0000
But even with that being the case, my work contact point is a number that I give out to businesses and such, not my "personal" one, and I've made it damned clear that I am not going to answer & won't reply unless I'm "on the clock" one way or another.


[16-Apr-25 02:08 PM] harkenn#0000
If PE's only production is via BMP C+2H, why is it unproiftable to make? Is it just constantly overproduced by everyone and then being offloaded at a loss?


[16-Apr-25 02:08 PM] harkenn#0000
(that seems an unlikely explanation)

Maybe the fact I don't have FIO connected on PP?


[16-Apr-25 02:20 PM] finestone#0000
PE is profitable even buying at ask and selling at bid are you on a manufac planet with 5 experts?


[16-Apr-25 02:21 PM] harkenn#0000
I'm only just starting out on Phobos, I don't think its a manufacturing planet (or at least, I don't see Manufacturing listed under infrastructure (which is what I thought it would've shown))


[16-Apr-25 02:24 PM] finestone#0000
to tell what a planet is you need to look at the COGC (Chamber of global Commerece Building)


[16-Apr-25 02:25 PM] finestone#0000
Phobos is an Electronics base hard starting out.


[16-Apr-25 02:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
My first job was at a school information system company- think student tracking, grades, enrollments, lunch money, all that stuff. I started when there were 40 people at the company, a year and a half later there were 400. 

One of my tickets was the first ticket we ever had a code review for, basically the trial run for the new process. It was a small ticket, something to remove duplicate enrollments (one student enrolled twice in the same grade at a school). Well it got reviewed by my boss and team lead.... got approved... went to the staging server... and bam, it deleted every enrollment that *wasn't* duplicated. 

They had to restore all the staging servers, which apparently was a lot of work... but hey, that's what staging is for üòÑ


[16-Apr-25 02:26 PM] finestone#0000
It is not usually advised to build off COGC that being said I assume food production on phobos is still fine


[16-Apr-25 02:27 PM] finestone#0000
since it has fertility its not terrible with farms/FP


[16-Apr-25 02:28 PM] finestone#0000
if you have received the grant you could do SDs or CLR on PHobos


[16-Apr-25 02:28 PM] harkenn#0000
The description says increases output, but is that just in the form of production throughput (reduced production time) or actual output efficiency (25% more output per input)?


[16-Apr-25 02:28 PM] harkenn#0000
I've not gotten the grant or anything yet. I'm still under a basic license, just getting a feel and at least trying to be efficient


[16-Apr-25 02:29 PM] finestone#0000
reduced production time


[16-Apr-25 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
More output per unit time, plus more output per unit of workforce consumable (rations and DW). And thus more output per building depreciation. But not more output per input material. But it's a big deal.


[16-Apr-25 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, like Finest_One said, brand new players often want more variety on their starter planet, so it's fine. Especially on Phobos.


[16-Apr-25 02:30 PM] finestone#0000
are you okay doing a Food setup for the moment i can put one together for you?


[16-Apr-25 02:30 PM] finestone#0000
but whatever you do make sure to max experts


[16-Apr-25 02:33 PM] harkenn#0000
Well, I'm like 3 days in; would it not be worthwhile to restart on either a planet condusive to construction or otherwise specialize with food? (I thought I saw somewhere there was a command to actually reset your own game?)


[16-Apr-25 02:34 PM] harkenn#0000
I'm also curious what you mean @archielvahr in that new players want variety on their starter planet? Trying to generalize as a new player seemed counter-productive to getting up and running quickly


[16-Apr-25 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
New players usually want to vertically integrate a few things on one planet.


[16-Apr-25 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
The tutorial also points you in that direction, I think


[16-Apr-25 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like I'm gonna extract water, grow crops, build an incinerator for carbon, AND smelt ore.


[16-Apr-25 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
"optimal" would be only FRMs or only SMEs or only INCs on each planet. But if you are stuck with only one planet, having 20 of the same building is boring


[16-Apr-25 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
And boring is worse than "optimal" for player retention üòÑ


[16-Apr-25 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
`COLIQ` is the reset command, it throws out everything and starts fresh.


[16-Apr-25 02:39 PM] finestone#0000
CLQ is your choice, you certainly dont need to

here is a good phobos AG setup


[16-Apr-25 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
So what I usually recommend is to build what you want, check it in PrunPlanner to make sure it vaguely makes sense... then as you grow into new planets, specialize more on each planet, making sure to match the planet's COGC


[16-Apr-25 02:39 PM] finestone#0000
you could slowly transition in SD and CLR as you get more captitol or move to other planets

That is what i did and quite enjoyed the learning process. If you end up getting pro and the grant this all just happens faster and you can go into whatever industry you want really

do you have pro?


[16-Apr-25 02:48 PM] finestone#0000
The other thing to remember early on is you really want to be able to sell to BID's so that you can turn your ouputs into immediate cash to continue growing


[16-Apr-25 02:49 PM] finestone#0000
that 16 day ROI is selling to Bids


[16-Apr-25 02:50 PM] finestone#0000
Then you can transition into this

[16-Apr-25 02:51 PM] finestone#0000
You can double your profit while still selling to bids but the ROI is terrible as it would cost roughly 3 million compared to the 650k FRM/FP base


[16-Apr-25 02:56 PM] harkenn#0000
Had to step away for a second. Not ignoring this, will be back


[16-Apr-25 02:59 PM] finestone#0000
All good take your time the other thing to pay attention to is Shipping import and export.


[16-Apr-25 03:00 PM] finestone#0000
eventually you can upgrade your ships but that wont be for while probably 3+ bases depending on what your doing.

Not opposed to restarting, although if its not for construction (deimos seems to be metallurgy?) then I might as well stay where I'm out and try to continue with what I've got thus far (meager as it may be) and see how farming is. I don't have pro atm (was trying to get a feel for the game before I bought it).

I liked the sound of construction, as far as the description of the various roles from the start of the game, and I'm liking the little bit of it that I'm doing thus far (at least, being able to build up the components I need to scale up my own production chain)...but I'm also cogniscent of the fact that at 2-3 days in I'm not sure I have any idea what I'm going to want to do, long term.

without pro sadly you can't really participate in DNPC, but if and when you decide to get pro I hope you'll consider joining us! we'd get you a full base and you'd still be eligible for the AGP for a 2nd base.
DNPC is construction, Deimos specifically is for extraction and ore smelting (your base would be an EXT/COL base), and then AL is shipped to Nike where it's turned into BBH and BSE.


[16-Apr-25 03:32 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah, I figured that was a prerequisite, as it seems to be for any of the grant programs (which makes sense)

Right but since it sounds like you're needing EXT/COL on Deimos, that wouldn't be a construction start, right? (since the construction is on Nike, which it sounds like you have enough of?). Not sure I'm understanding what you're meaning to say you need, for that DNPC program/project


[16-Apr-25 03:37 PM] jab.sh#0000
you're still limited to the market band, and there's no guarantee anyone will buy it at the price you pick üòÑ


[16-Apr-25 03:38 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah that's correct, but the start you pick only has a small impact on the game. once you have the capital you can put down a base on any planet

^ that's what I had figured would happen when I had the option to start on Deimos even though it had 0 slots available at the time.


[16-Apr-25 04:07 PM] finestone#0000
-5 implies 6 players would have to go inactive/accounts delete/coliq for a slot to open up

[16-Apr-25 04:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
that (+2) indicates over population. Normally you can only setup a base on a planet with available plots. But since Deimos is a starter planet, new players can get there a base even tho the planet is technically full. 
Goes for every starter planet, but Deimos is especially most of the time overcrowded.


[16-Apr-25 04:18 PM] harkenn#0000
Right but it says -5 on the left hand side (available plots) so how is it 5 plots over-used, but only 2 over population?

pretty sure the -5 is a bug, and the +2 means there's 2 more bases than available bases (two ghost bases)

[17-Apr-25 09:56 AM] harkenn#0000
There's not a limit to the experts you can have on a base, right? e.g. having experts assigned doesn't reduce the generation rate of other types of experts or anything like that?


[17-Apr-25 09:56 AM] jab.sh#0000
you can assign up to 5 per industry, 6 total


[17-Apr-25 09:57 AM] jab.sh#0000
but you still accumulate experts even if you have 6 assigned


[17-Apr-25 09:58 AM] pagy1234#0000

wdym?


[17-Apr-25 10:00 AM] jcheung#0000
You can think of each type of expert having its own xp bar. Each completion of matching industry gives xp. Assigning expert will speed up xp gain for that type, and not affect the others


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] harkenn#0000
Ok, just wanted to make sure it wasn't a mechanic where there was a soft cap on the # of experts in a base (where generation of new experts progressively slows as the total number of experts on base grows)


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
5 is the max per industry


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] jcheung#0000
No, jist a hard cap


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
as a hard limit


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] jcheung#0000
It takes a few weeks to get full experts


[17-Apr-25 10:01 AM] jcheung#0000
You'll get first 3 of a type fast


[17-Apr-25 10:02 AM] harkenn#0000
right right, its just the sort of thing where I expected a soft cap, that's all.

Is expert generation chance scaled based on the tier of a producing structure? i.e. with 0 experts would you generate them faster by building/running 10 PPT1s versus 2 PPT3 (roughly the same cost to setup)


[17-Apr-25 11:13 AM] evany.#0000
i wish there was a pause or skip button in production rather than delete


[17-Apr-25 11:14 AM] evany.#0000

Factorio automatically pauses if the output is full, which technically prun does too


[17-Apr-25 11:20 AM] evany.#0000
so if you have 10 buildings you will get expert #1 today (if its say 10 hour jobs, by end of 30 hours)


[17-Apr-25 11:21 AM] evany.#0000
no i'm referring to if you have say 3 compnent/parts you wanted in a chest and its filled the other two - then it will only make the third component
i.e you have 10+ FFC, stop making them
whilst if i delete them in prun i have to remember to go add them back, but this feature is readily available using combinators in factorio


[17-Apr-25 11:26 AM] harkenn#0000

[17-Apr-25 11:29 AM] harkenn#0000
Ah, yeah that's the real crux then. I would have said the silver lining is that it makes it more likely that he'd be willing to take on outside help if Prun isn't associated with a game development company...but if that were actually the case, he'd probably have already done it by now.

that guy isn't even doing that much habitat ?


[18-Apr-25 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
It's impossible to gauge the demand on HAB without selling out for 6 months first, lol


[18-Apr-25 06:54 AM] tanda#0000
HAB is pretty much entirely backroom deals to get what you need, since so few people have UPFs


[18-Apr-25 07:09 AM] evov#0000
There's a few things working against HAB availability.

1. Probably the biggest one is charity. Pop inf is often viewed as a "public good". So when Gov's put out the call asking for materials to upgrade stuff, potential producers often provide them at a discount. In some cases, they sell for less than cost of the input materials. This makes it very very unattractive for people to set up any production with HAB/LU/WOR as the goal. That, coupled with relatively low demand consistency means planning to make these goods is a very bad business.

2. The building that makes them (UPF) also makes command bridges and crew quarters. I think people would be shocked to know the price I'd have to sell HAB/WOR/LU for in order to meet the same profitability margins as I'd make on some of those ship parts.


[18-Apr-25 07:14 AM] tanda#0000
2) I get, but it's shocking to see how many non-ship builders completely dismiss UPFs as a profit stream at all


[18-Apr-25 07:21 AM] evov#0000
Looking at HAB - There's been zero sold on the CX in the past week.
There are - 32 currently available on the CX.
Prices range from 120k to 180k

I would say it very very very meets the definition of a product that is currently over supplied.


[18-Apr-25 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah but is the price of those hab fair ?


[18-Apr-25 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
I could put 100 million LTA on the cx, if they're priced 500k AIC/u, no one will buy them and can barely be called "supply"


[18-Apr-25 07:23 AM] evov#0000
The cheapest HAB's are for 120k. I don't know if that's "fair" or not. I know that I wouldn't bother making any if there's zero sales of it.


[18-Apr-25 07:23 AM] laaxus#0000
true enough


[18-Apr-25 07:24 AM] laaxus#0000
liquidity is a vertuous cycle


[18-Apr-25 07:25 AM] evov#0000
As I said in #1 -  it's the heavily discounted private trade that prevents the markets from handling price/volume properly for those items.

[18-Apr-25 07:28 AM] evov#0000
It drives me nuts when I see people in corp's complain about how they think something should be cheaper than it is.  Omg why is this thing that I need but don't make so expensive! I think it should cost XX. And then you realize that person is buying all their FIM and RATS and Carbon and all these other things from an internal corp market, so their perspective on pricing is just.... delusional.

[18-Apr-25 07:28 AM] laaxus#0000
What about me who think x should cost XX, but I buy everything from the CX and I'm one of the largest producer of x ? üòÑ


[18-Apr-25 07:29 AM] evov#0000
Well, if you think something is mis-priced, you should take advantage of it and start producing it if you think it's way too expensive. Or, if it's too cheap, start buying it up and stop making it.


[18-Apr-25 07:30 AM] evov#0000
Complaining that other people don't agree with your view on pricing isn't one of the valid choices.


[18-Apr-25 07:30 AM] laaxus#0000
I think AL is too cheap, but I can't buy enough of it for the price to go up üò¶


[18-Apr-25 07:30 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't complain with anybody in particular


[18-Apr-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm just like "mmmm AL at 30k profit / day might not be fair" (IDK what the current profitability is)


[18-Apr-25 07:33 AM] realharvey#0000
its 47k


[18-Apr-25 07:36 AM] zillatron#0000
isnt that counter to say, whatever price you think LTA should be? if the input goods price goes up so will the end product, no?


[18-Apr-25 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
What I mean by "should be" is "ideally"
Market price is market price, I don't get to set it with words


[18-Apr-25 07:41 AM] zillatron#0000
sure, my question was more if you think the 'ideal' price of AL is too low but LTA is 'too high', arent those things somewhat counter to eachother?


[18-Apr-25 07:42 AM] zillatron#0000
i mean not somewhat, they are haha


[18-Apr-25 07:42 AM] laaxus#0000
my ideal price of LTA is relative to the price of AL


[18-Apr-25 07:42 AM] laaxus#0000
shall the price of AL rise as I wish, so will my ideal price of LTA


[18-Apr-25 07:43 AM] laaxus#0000
by price, I'm talking more about the profitability of a recipe
Than the absolute price of the good


[18-Apr-25 07:44 AM] zillatron#0000
500 days or whatever it was ago when i started AL was something like 500/u, 600 was a 'good' price (for me). C, FLX and AL have all gone up since then, O is reasonably stable iirc


[18-Apr-25 07:44 AM] zillatron#0000
so im not sure i follow the logic that whatever fabs that use AL are 'overpriced' given all the input goods have also increased in price over time


[18-Apr-25 07:45 AM] harkenn#0000
AL is used in so many things, I'm not sure its actually very accurate to say the price of the two is tied to one another. And for LTA in particular, its not even the dominant production cost; glass is, right?


[18-Apr-25 07:45 AM] zillatron#0000
it was just an example


[18-Apr-25 07:45 AM] zillatron#0000
obvioulsy it's not the *only* factor


[18-Apr-25 07:46 AM] zillatron#0000
i just find the logic perplexing haha


[18-Apr-25 07:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I just think that 350k profit per day might a bit too much for a PP2 recipe üòÑ


[18-Apr-25 07:50 AM] harkenn#0000
Does the universe periodically reset? Or is the spareseness (relatively) of planetary development just due to limited playerbase?


[18-Apr-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, once every 10 years

[18-Apr-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
don't expect the universe to reset any time soon


[18-Apr-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
my bet is a 3 to 5 years range


[18-Apr-25 07:51 AM] harkenn#0000
Has it ever been reset?


[18-Apr-25 07:51 AM] laaxus#0000
yes

[18-Apr-25 07:51 AM] harkenn#0000
oh ok, how long ago? I didn't know precisely how long prun has been in development


[18-Apr-25 07:52 AM] laaxus#0000
you can always look at the age of the universe by looking at usr molp


[18-Apr-25 07:53 AM] harkenn#0000
So 4 years it looks like. I like how he has a planet out on his own


[18-Apr-25 08:09 AM] evov#0000

Having your own planet is nice. I needed SET for making KOM so I ran an immigration program and added an INF. Bam, basically 300 SET on demand


[18-Apr-25 01:39 PM] bishopsix#0000
Heya folks, while I am building up my AL base in Deimos, I wanted to ask apart from that, what other base do you all need? I could go greedy for 2 AL bases and I am fine with that to go crazy with ALO, bonkers, even.


[18-Apr-25 01:39 PM] bishopsix#0000
Heck, why not 10 bases for AL


[18-Apr-25 01:39 PM] bishopsix#0000
well, you get the gist üòÑ


[18-Apr-25 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
The best thing you can do is make profitable bases


[18-Apr-25 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
if a base is very profitable, it means it's fulfilling something antares need


[18-Apr-25 01:40 PM] bishopsix#0000
i never thought of it that way ü§î


[18-Apr-25 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
in that scenario, I would usually give a list of the most profitable bases


[18-Apr-25 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
but the game just had major changes planned, so the whole market is reshuffling


[18-Apr-25 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
it's hard to know what will be needed in a month


[18-Apr-25 01:42 PM] bishopsix#0000
will there be a server reset?


[18-Apr-25 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000

[18-Apr-25 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
if you don't know what to do, you can make a wpl base on hephaestus


[18-Apr-25 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
however, if you have the time, I would recommend making a base on prunplanner for every single building
It will take a lot of time, but you'll discover every single recipe


[18-Apr-25 01:44 PM] bishopsix#0000
that's crazy! I love it

[18-Apr-25 03:39 PM] vanarazor#0000
Why you say that? FRM HER is good, FP RAT FIM is good, ext HAL is probably not since if feels like we don‚Äôt have enough CHP to process it so CHP NA would be nice too


[18-Apr-25 06:30 PM] tanda#0000
FRM/HER is going to take a hit, hard to say what it's going to stabilize at. FP RAT FIM is going to be weird as well


[18-Apr-25 06:30 PM] tanda#0000
keep in mind that a LOT of people are moving out of IDC right now, and it will be to unpredictable markets

It's not peak capitalism at all. MM's are artificial incentives determined at the whims of a central planning party of 1. Removing all MM's and artificial incentives would be far more capitalistic imo.

more like using a TBM to drill a hole for your gas pipe


[19-Apr-25 08:01 PM] finestone#0000
Starting out I think generally goal should be sub 21 day ROI with being able to sell to bid.  That implies a market demand for said good and you will get instant cash.


[19-Apr-25 08:03 PM] finestone#0000
I think that rule will carry you well into 10+ bases at which point you can start to think about total income per permit and you will also need to balance shipping more carefully possibly expanding your fleet depending on what you are doing.

[20-Apr-25 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
Gonna be harder than you think


[20-Apr-25 03:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
quarter of the way to 10 mil i guess


[20-Apr-25 03:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
was gonna say 10 mil


[20-Apr-25 03:43 AM] pagy1234#0000

hence why the extra HAL


[20-Apr-25 03:54 AM] vanarazor#0000
im in the same boat, Im thinkking about dropping another POL base

[20-Apr-25 03:54 AM] vanarazor#0000
but still will be extra HAL, so I ve looked into LI smelting.. and I;ve got scared

EPO / PG equally


[20-Apr-25 03:55 AM] vanarazor#0000

is EPO better than PG?

not really it depends which ones of the ingredients you managed to have vertically integrated IMO

2 ftl

[20-Apr-25 04:00 AM] vanarazor#0000
most of the ideas I have would require me to get more ships


[20-Apr-25 04:00 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah shipping is the bottleneck


[20-Apr-25 04:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
same for me, thats why i saved for a bit to get a new ship[


[20-Apr-25 04:01 AM] realharvey#0000
at the beginning ships will slow you down for quite a bit in expansion. But once you have a decent size buying a new ship is just a week of profit

have you thought about Thalassa B for AGRI ?


[20-Apr-25 04:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
I did, but its very expensive


[20-Apr-25 04:04 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah I know I wanted to expand in thalassa but repair in term of INS and HSE are scary ( luckily Tanda is providing them at very fair prices) way too fair IMO


[20-Apr-25 04:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, the INS price is most of the reason that I dont expand more in SE-110


[20-Apr-25 04:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
i don;t understand how you brought your STL ship in the designated area


[20-Apr-25 04:09 AM] vanarazor#0000

[20-Apr-25 04:15 AM] laaxus#0000
There's no secret base making 300k per permit


[20-Apr-25 04:16 AM] laaxus#0000
Best you Can Do is MM


[20-Apr-25 04:16 AM] laaxus#0000
That's what the bigger player do


[20-Apr-25 04:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah fair, but I can just make the MM items


[20-Apr-25 04:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
like what are some intermadiate items I could do is what Im asking pretty much


[20-Apr-25 04:19 AM] vanarazor#0000
look at the rabbit hole for HAL > LI > CB*/POW


[20-Apr-25 04:20 AM] vanarazor#0000
IDC is still pretty good if you have 15KK to invest and have most of your consumables integrated


[20-Apr-25 04:20 AM] vanarazor#0000
WAI seems to be the way for SL


[20-Apr-25 04:20 AM] realharvey#0000
no one really knows how the market will react and who will produce which component. Some might rely on the market and others will fully integrate every step themselfs


[20-Apr-25 04:22 AM] vanarazor#0000
My thinking was: Im producing MEA now should I stop or not ?


if I don't stop how can use my MEA > SCI building > ECA /  SL  ( kind of way too expensive for my wallet top get into)

if I do > I ll probably just produce FIM instead which at the moment is way better than MEA T_T


[20-Apr-25 04:22 AM] vanarazor#0000
I feel like dumping my stock on the market to be honest


[20-Apr-25 04:24 AM] vanarazor#0000
what base is making 300 K per permit ? MM mats?


[20-Apr-25 04:24 AM] vanarazor#0000
IDC at best is making 250K wit 60 d ROI


[20-Apr-25 04:25 AM] realharvey#0000
300k per permit is usually things that are currently heavily underproduced


[20-Apr-25 04:25 AM] realharvey#0000
those bases also have a high risk of: You have stock sitting on the CX that doesnt sell for quite a while


[20-Apr-25 04:25 AM] realharvey#0000
giving you cash flow issues


[20-Apr-25 04:25 AM] vanarazor#0000
like what R fabs >


[20-Apr-25 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
None


[20-Apr-25 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
RFabs don't make 300k


[20-Apr-25 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000
They make 120k at best (except maybe rde but I'm onto it)


[20-Apr-25 04:27 AM] vanarazor#0000
every build Im looking at, I see a ton of R fabs ..even HQ upgrades need them


[20-Apr-25 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
Count on me to keep RFabs and LFabs Price low


[20-Apr-25 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, it doesn't mean heavy profit


[20-Apr-25 04:27 AM] laaxus#0000
AL is extremely needed, and yet it's only 50k per permit


[20-Apr-25 04:27 AM] vanarazor#0000
I mean, the demand is always going to be greater right ?


[20-Apr-25 04:28 AM] vanarazor#0000
AL is needed but there not enough Fabs to use what 's being produced


[20-Apr-25 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
Again, doesn't mean PP3 base make 300k


[20-Apr-25 04:28 AM] laaxus#0000
Check for yourself on prunplanner


[20-Apr-25 04:29 AM] vanarazor#0000
nah I checked Im bottlenecked by cash flow ( and ships which is cash flowas well )


[20-Apr-25 04:30 AM] laaxus#0000
RFabs aren't very liquid either


[20-Apr-25 04:30 AM] evov#0000
There's lots of things that make more than 300k per permint. But... they're usually pretty expensive to set up, and often rely on either complex production lines, temporarily high prices for what you're making, or low prices for the input materials.

[20-Apr-25 04:33 AM] laaxus#0000
PP3 make a consistent 120k


[20-Apr-25 04:33 AM] laaxus#0000
but which base make a consistent 300k ?


[20-Apr-25 04:34 AM] vanarazor#0000
I've looked a bit today and the best I found for consistency is IDC at 250k


[20-Apr-25 04:34 AM] evov#0000
Just saying... just because YOU don't know of any bases that make 300k... doesn't mean there aren't any.

given that neext update is not tomorrow

At the end of the day, everything is subject to market forces. Things can go up or down in profitability.
Even things like MM's  (IDC) can be heavily disrupted by a spike in MEA prices.


[20-Apr-25 04:41 AM] realharvey#0000
if something makes a lot of margin consistently, then good on you. Once you tell others it might stop being as profitable

12k? damn


[20-Apr-25 12:18 PM] tanda#0000
looks like everybody's self producing. I was thinking about using the CX instead of dropping a base for it, but I might have to rethink that


[20-Apr-25 12:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
More than LDE lol


[20-Apr-25 12:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
CX has always been kinda shaky for it imo


[20-Apr-25 12:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
Goes in and out of being viable quite a bit


[20-Apr-25 12:20 PM] .shiva.#0000
WPLs just kinda suck production/area wise


[20-Apr-25 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
easy low maintenance base though


[20-Apr-25 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
also i would slot a PPF instead of 2 STO


[20-Apr-25 12:24 PM] .shiva.#0000
Yeah, but at the same time kinda not one that's super attractive for new players since bulk PG is kinda expensive to stock up on


[20-Apr-25 12:25 PM] jcheung#0000
yes


[20-Apr-25 12:25 PM] jcheung#0000
that is true


[20-Apr-25 12:25 PM] jcheung#0000
i started off with WPLs but i also was basically borrowing the PG


[20-Apr-25 12:25 PM] tanda#0000
I'm about to need a full base per day, lol


[20-Apr-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
And it cost half of that on hephaestus


[20-Apr-25 12:27 PM] jcheung#0000
can contract a new player to build it and supply their base


[20-Apr-25 12:27 PM] tanda#0000
yep, I was looking at it from the perspective of me having to drop it, lol


[20-Apr-25 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000

[20-Apr-25 12:27 PM] jcheung#0000

Next POPR in 4 days... so I have a little bit of breathing time to get my gripp


[21-Apr-25 04:08 PM] akyantor#0000
The main thing to do is establish what pop upkeep goods were being maintained to keep a steady state of pops. You've got health buffers of the all key pops utilised (PIO, SET, TECH), so should hopefully be fairly straightforward.


[21-Apr-25 04:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Looks like OFF for SST / INF, and DW for the PAR are the key ones that have been topped up fairly recently.


[21-Apr-25 04:09 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I know, that my job is to keep the planet running. I have a brief grasp of the POPR and program system, but will need to look closer into it.


[21-Apr-25 04:10 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd start out by setting up Archiel's sheet assuming that you keep supplying those upkeep goods, and see what it tells oyu.

[22-Apr-25 10:59 AM] realharvey#0000
Ship builders have set themselves up to build specific templates because it's way easier


[22-Apr-25 10:59 AM] realharvey#0000
Those builds are also what is considered meta in most cases


[22-Apr-25 11:00 AM] harkenn#0000
So no one is going through this process to acquire new ships? The help docs seem to suggest it was a "everyone does this"

(it didn't seem very different from how you build buildings or a base)


[22-Apr-25 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
The process is dming evov


[22-Apr-25 11:01 AM] jab.sh#0000


[22-Apr-25 11:01 AM] jab.sh#0000
here's one of EvoV's ship blueprints (2k/2k)


[22-Apr-25 11:01 AM] jab.sh#0000
you can check that thread for the others


[22-Apr-25 11:02 AM] harkenn#0000
So everyone uses Evov's blueprints/designs, then, but still builds them themselves? Is it because its very easy to fuck up a ship design horrifically?


[22-Apr-25 11:03 AM] jab.sh#0000
you have to build it yourself


[22-Apr-25 11:03 AM] moke.#0000
Cant transfer ship ownership


[22-Apr-25 11:03 AM] jab.sh#0000
there's no mechanism in the game to transfer ship ownership


[22-Apr-25 11:04 AM] harkenn#0000
Right, that makes sense. I guess the notion that designing your own ships was instantly written off by those first few messages above just suggests an underlying truth everyone takes for granted (as to why no one builds the blueprints themselves). I was just trying to understand that truth.


[22-Apr-25 11:04 AM] jab.sh#0000
you can design your own ship and try to source from the CX but that's going to have inherent price variability and availability issues


[22-Apr-25 11:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
nah nah, its just that you buy the parts, not the ship


[22-Apr-25 11:04 AM] moke.#0000
You're more than welcome to - the issue is the parts market is sparse


[22-Apr-25 11:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
and people follow set designs because its hard to get individual parts


[22-Apr-25 11:05 AM] moke.#0000
For example I had to contract someone to make me enough AWH for one of my shuttles that needs it


[22-Apr-25 11:05 AM] harkenn#0000
Oh, there's that much variability in the ship parts then? And they have no other use than ships that need that particular thing...gotcha


[22-Apr-25 11:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
kinda, theres just alot of ship parts, and they are all hard and expensive to make, so people dont wanna make all of then, and just make the ones that fit the blueprint they sell


[22-Apr-25 11:13 AM] realharvey#0000
Also the efficiency gain by specialized ship blueprints for a specific usecase is pretty negligible


[22-Apr-25 12:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
The designs are based on experimentation (using BLU and BTF) 
- QCR and FSE work best in most situations.
- Dont need the seats usually.
- Shields are very expensive so only those who make them or those who have money to throw around use them
- medium or large fuel tanks are just preference. LSL is overkill tho unless its an SF hauler. I run large SF tanks on 2 of my LCBs since they exclusively haul SF.
- LHP because i think very few people make BHP, since LHP is lighter, makes ships go faster, and is cheaper to repair.
- drones are shit compared to the price iirc
- and all the fancy extra stuff (shields, seats, drones) add weight, slowing your ship down. To counter that, people sometimes may consider specialty engines but those would most likely need to be made to order due to the lack of a market for them.

There are some places where you can pick up parts of ships, but they're rare


[22-Apr-25 02:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
There are some in OOG who like to use all the shields drones and AHP as it changes the repair time to like 5x or something like that


[22-Apr-25 02:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Does any of you have a good way to measure how much of a ship a base occupies and at what point it makes sense to buy another one? Currently, I go by gut feeling - if I don't get to keep up with logistics, I need another one. But I wonder, if there is a more "mathematical" way to decide that ü§î

Was I angry? Hell no, did the shipping crew get their delivery bonuses? Well... After a successful 6-week haul, they enjoyed a 0.03% profit share, half a slice of bread, and the eternal shame of forgetting one crate of construction units. (Don‚Äôt worry, we deducted it from their pay. You're welcome.)

Look at the shipping demands of each of your bases, then get an average round trip flight time, add 12 hours. Whatever supply period you decide to maintain at each base, if you can sustain that level each time period, you're good.


[24-Apr-25 08:53 AM] realharvey#0000
are you able to supply your bases good enough that you can go awol for a couple days and still not get into an shipping deficit?


[24-Apr-25 08:54 AM] realharvey#0000
Then you are good to go. If stuff gets already tight when you miss a day: Get another ship

[25-Apr-25 05:06 AM] pagy1234#0000
might rotate Norwick, Phobos and Harmonia back to RAT


[25-Apr-25 05:56 AM] tanda#0000
Wow, maybe the RAT price might finally go down


[25-Apr-25 06:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think something is proken in the planner tho, because it says that FIM makes like 4k/d for a full base or something like that,


[25-Apr-25 06:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
but my Norwick base make 140k a day still


[25-Apr-25 06:40 AM] magican1980#0000
in the last 2-4 Rations could be sold at 1 credit under Market Maker ... so if you vertical produce, you make very good profits


[25-Apr-25 06:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats what I used to do, and it worked pretty well


[25-Apr-25 06:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
only problem is that the FRM bases make like 30-40k max


[25-Apr-25 06:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
so il lose like 40k income from just the FRM


[25-Apr-25 06:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
for now its still better for me to do FIM


[25-Apr-25 08:41 AM] vanarazor#0000
not for long IMO FIM is dropping


[25-Apr-25 08:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, but even at this rate it will take a bit to actually get below RAT


[25-Apr-25 09:53 AM] jab.sh#0000
did C drop? I was about to sell some last night


[25-Apr-25 09:54 AM] laaxus#0000

I have HYF as my Farms üôÇ and with the 21 HYF I get enough mats for 1 FP Planet only for RAT. If you not have H2O vertical integratet and the logistic, I cant recommend this setup


[25-Apr-25 10:13 AM] jab.sh#0000
yeah the bottom hasn't really moved


[25-Apr-25 11:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
where do you have your HYF?

[25-Apr-25 11:43 AM] harkenn#0000
Some of ya'll need NL. I know you do. You should pick some up off the CX.


[25-Apr-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
bought a couple pieces :D


[25-Apr-25 11:45 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I don‚Äôt think people want to buy at almost 8k/u


[25-Apr-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, NL generally isnt that high


[25-Apr-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
and I would assume that alot of people who consume it would have stockpiles to wait out the prices

LDE is unprofitable at CX prices for AL and NL as it stands


[25-Apr-25 11:55 AM] realharvey#0000
I don't know which maniac posted LDE for 10k

[25-Apr-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
It was made from NL bought at 5.6k


[25-Apr-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
I needed cash anyway


[25-Apr-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
60k?


[25-Apr-25 12:02 PM] pagy1234#0000

[25-Apr-25 12:06 PM] laaxus#0000
I put a large bid for NL, I won't buy at ask, I Can wait


[25-Apr-25 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
I will definitely eat some NL, but not at 8k a pop, and not with LDE being cheaper to buy


[25-Apr-25 01:27 PM] harkenn#0000

I am looking for like-minded people who would also prefer that when you click on a ticker in the Commodity Exchange Orders Window, you go directly to the CXPO window and not to CXOB. (Since the CXOB is integrated in the CXPO window anyway and I want to update my orders more quickly)

[25-Apr-25 05:21 PM] vanarazor#0000
RAT is going to drop as well @pagy1234, tat's my prediction


[25-Apr-25 05:22 PM] vanarazor#0000
become agri product become cheaper due to MEA >FIM >RAT.

selling C should be more profitable, I am surprised the price of G is rising


[25-Apr-25 05:22 PM] bishopsix#0000
if rat falls then all frms fall too


[25-Apr-25 05:22 PM] bishopsix#0000
right?


[25-Apr-25 05:23 PM] jab.sh#0000
RAT's lowest avg in 90 days is 160


[25-Apr-25 05:23 PM] vanarazor#0000
I think the thing is consumables for PIO and SET are "liquid" means they are always going to find a buyer within CX ask/bid but yeah IMO we ' ll see agri product price drop due to lower demand


[25-Apr-25 05:24 PM] igfloz#0000
not really, a lot of FRM product goes into C production


[25-Apr-25 05:24 PM] jab.sh#0000
there's a demand of 443k RAT compared to a supply of 24k


[25-Apr-25 05:24 PM] bishopsix#0000
oooh i forgot about C


[25-Apr-25 05:24 PM] bishopsix#0000
yeah that's why I am surprised


[25-Apr-25 05:25 PM] vanarazor#0000
I think I'd use HYF for C rather than FRM, I use FRM for HER


[25-Apr-25 05:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm about to spend $25m to make RAT and C, maybe that's a terrible idea üòÑ


[25-Apr-25 05:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
i just don;t understand why C is rising and RAT is not dropping ..


[25-Apr-25 05:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
too much demand for RAT


[25-Apr-25 05:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
people are paying $163


[25-Apr-25 05:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
RAT has not enough supply


[25-Apr-25 05:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah


[25-Apr-25 05:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
although technically there's infinite supply, but it's at $166


[25-Apr-25 05:27 PM] tanda#0000
before all this ~~FIM~~Mea business, I did some digging and found that the universe is about 10k RAT per day short


[25-Apr-25 05:27 PM] tanda#0000
which isn't an issue due to MM's, but that's how much is getting bought from the MM rather than players


[25-Apr-25 05:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
what about ANT?


[25-Apr-25 05:28 PM] tanda#0000
something like 3-4k a day? It's been a while so the number has probably changed

{Reactions}
üëç 

[25-Apr-25 05:28 PM] tanda#0000
It's a number large enough that no single player could really have an effect on it without it being the only thing they did


[25-Apr-25 05:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
also Tanda I was gonna send you a contract for rfabs but most of your prices are above market price now üòÖ


[25-Apr-25 05:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, AFC makes about 6-7k RAT/day gross, we'd need a 2nd AFC to meet demand basically


[25-Apr-25 05:30 PM] jab.sh#0000
personally I'm about +1k RAT/day net (although all of that RAT is AFC RAT)


[25-Apr-25 05:30 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I've been buying LFABs from the market instead of producing them myself


[25-Apr-25 05:30 PM] vanarazor#0000
do we really?


[25-Apr-25 05:31 PM] tanda#0000
so I couldn't offer them as cheaply as before. That changes after this weekend, my PP2 base is up and running and will fill my needs, letting me drop my prices

[25-Apr-25 05:32 PM] tanda#0000
It also doesn't help that the market for RFABs has kinda gone nuts


[25-Apr-25 05:33 PM] tanda#0000
a lot of those prices are below breakeven if you don't source everything internally


[25-Apr-25 05:35 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah markets are incentivising CO-Op and vertical integrations


[25-Apr-25 05:36 PM] igfloz#0000
you could argue the reverse - with so many co-ops and internal trades, there kinda is no CX market for stocks


[25-Apr-25 05:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
mm I see your point


[25-Apr-25 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
a lot of times it can look like my products are out of stock because I have everything listed on the CX, it's not like the product waits around, lol


[25-Apr-25 05:41 PM] jab.sh#0000
you could update your sheet to include your CX orders?


[25-Apr-25 06:11 PM] tanda#0000
hmm, I'll have to look into that

the undersupply of RAT is massive though, It will probably need to double production before RAT prices leave the MM


[25-Apr-25 10:44 PM] magican1980#0000
I have reduced my weekly production from 6.6 to 4.4 and stopped selling mostly on CX to Buy-Orders ... part of the changes comes from me

that's what I thought as well


[26-Apr-25 06:04 PM] igfloz#0000
maybe 24K "in total" for your original screen capture, but not 24K per delivery


[26-Apr-25 06:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
it was a joke yeah The total was 24K

last time I did it, it was 15/t


[26-Apr-25 06:06 PM] igfloz#0000
I don't recall the user (or clan) that does nothing but shipping, but I think they only accept ads of 25K or so (I think ? )


[26-Apr-25 06:07 PM] loans_13178#0000
Do you want to make money shipping things for other CEO‚Äôs but can‚Äôt find any customers? Well worry no more, as here in the Inch Centimeter discord channel we provide a service to connect shipping providers to customers for a variety of shipment types including recurring, one time, and emergency shipment orders. Join our discord to learn more! https://discord.gg/7Cs93Mua


[26-Apr-25 06:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
well it's calculated $/t. So I've splited into multiple so people with starting ships can fit at least 1 if they also shipping their stuff


[26-Apr-25 06:07 PM] loans_13178#0000
I just copied his message this is not my advertisement.


[26-Apr-25 06:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
I assume 25K comes from full 3K/1K or 2K/2K ship


[26-Apr-25 06:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
in that case mine is 24K but it's not a full ship


[26-Apr-25 06:10 PM] igfloz#0000
That might be a correct assumption - yeah, you did the right thing with breaking it down to tonnage I think - apologies


[26-Apr-25 06:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
No worries üòÖ I had issues with shipping contracts when I was starting out with idle 500/500 ship. It helped a lot when people splited it like that

< Yea, I run 2 consutruction planets in the IA region at the moment.


[27-Apr-25 03:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
I remember you said that those planets are to fund the gateways, are the taxes there considerably higher than elsewhere?


[27-Apr-25 03:16 AM] evov#0000
Yea, the taxes are a little bit higher, mostly for eng/sci. But considering the planet pays for all the immigration programs and maintains solid pop growth/control - the total fee cost isn't that high.


[27-Apr-25 03:17 AM] laaxus#0000
Taxes are quite inexpensive anyway, if the planet is well managed, it's all worth it


[27-Apr-25 03:17 AM] evov#0000
Ultimately, I find there's no amount of taxes that out-weighs the cost of slow pop fulfilment or pop drops down the line.


[27-Apr-25 03:17 AM] laaxus#0000
one week without cogc would lose more profit than slightly higher taxes

This picture could be a strong marketing tool if you also add environmental factors (INS, SEA, HSE, TSH) for each planet


[27-Apr-25 03:24 AM] evov#0000
People can figuire that out for themselves. Flight time from CX's is also a relevant factor that could make sense.

Perhaps I could answer some questions?

{Reactions}
üåà 

[27-Apr-25 12:19 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Regards population - what am I exactly trying to achieve? 
If there is a shortage, I obviously want to increase migration/education, so that everybody gets there workers.
Also, I want to maintain happiness above 50%, so population level keep steady. 
But if everything is fine, what should I do? Do I need to do anything?


[27-Apr-25 12:19 PM] pxlfox.#0000
And how do I find out, that everything is "fine"?


[27-Apr-25 12:19 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm a noob too, but from what I understand is you don't want to waste money either, so if pop is fine don't try to raise it


[27-Apr-25 12:21 PM] tanda#0000
1) you're trying to keep a steady population, either steady growth or flat, depending on what your planet needs. (Most planets are growing, so growth makes sense)
2) if everything is fine, you see the absolute minimum pop supply you can get away with and just feed that until things change to "not fine" or "needs growth"


[27-Apr-25 12:22 PM] tanda#0000
3) either Archiel's governing sheet or PRUNplanner's government mode is going to be able to give  you the in depth analysis you need to make judgement calls


[27-Apr-25 12:22 PM] tanda#0000
and given the changes coming on the 5th to POP consumption, I recommend Archiel's sheet. Prunplanner has been really slow keeping up to date on any game changes


[27-Apr-25 12:23 PM] pxlfox.#0000
how to decide, if my planet needs growth?


[27-Apr-25 12:24 PM] jab.sh#0000
check unemployment/open jobs


[27-Apr-25 12:24 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Like for example, Electronica has basically no Engineers/Scientists

Do I want to let them grow, so people have them when they join? Or do I wait till somebody requests them?


[27-Apr-25 12:24 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah but it also has 0 open jobs so there's no demand


[27-Apr-25 12:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
is anyone in chat asking for them?


[27-Apr-25 12:26 PM] pxlfox.#0000
That's obivous - but open jobs only appear in the next POPR _after_ somebody placed down a base. Ideally, you want them filled as fast as possible. Also, ENG and SCI grow really slowly, so it will take some time to get them filled.


[27-Apr-25 12:26 PM] tanda#0000
I think a good idea would be to take a look at all Chemistry buildings. How many require ENG, how many require SCI? How commonly needed are the products made by these buildings?

if it's unlikely that there's going to be a need for these buildings, and other planets are already able to fill the need for the pops involved, chances are you won't need to grow those pops

ig, for example, has paid enough to be a star supporter. that's a whole heck of a lot more than a AAA game. it wouldn't be too much to ask to have a few more differences between free and what they have.

TBQH I think pretty much all of the "pro" perks should be under basic as well. Capping HQ upgrades and limiting concurrent ships in flight seems like more than enough to me, everything else is just limiting an already confined market and making the game more of an un-fun grind.

I'd say at least access to a third, yeah.


[27-Apr-25 04:36 PM] manhim#0000

[27-Apr-25 04:36 PM] potaterror#0000
Shipping is the big one.


[27-Apr-25 04:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
HQ upgrades and unlimited ships


[27-Apr-25 04:38 PM] potaterror#0000
HQ upgrades you can kind of dance around with gifted time, but to run any substantial empire you're going to need to be able to fly >2 or 3 ships concurrently...or do a lot of juggling and have reliable associates.


[27-Apr-25 04:39 PM] igfloz#0000
I don't think ships are limited. Out of my 4 ships 2 are in flight and can still select to fly another


[27-Apr-25 04:39 PM] potaterror#0000

Almost every free web-based games that I know ended up failing due to too much costs. The others either brought up demo versions with a paywall (like this one) or put up so much ads that they made me give up.


[27-Apr-25 04:44 PM] potaterror#0000
That's why I think the ship limit is a good balance point. It acts as a pretty significant barrier to expansion that provides a motive to keep funding the game, but still allows for players who can't afford that to engage with the game in a way that isn't straight-up painful and which can be worked around to a limited extent.

I mean, yeah, kinda. If you're looking for cheap entertainment the time investment in extra coordination and planning may be a bit of a boon instead of a hinderance, and it keeps players on basic engaged, which means more chance of stepping back up to pro.

Running an empire off of LM ads alone is gonna limit where you can build if you want any degree of reliability.

who may be convinced to support you in the future if you retain them*


[27-Apr-25 04:51 PM] potaterror#0000
Eh, I'd argue against cont restrictions still, just because unrestricted conts means players on basic are probably acting as part of production syndicates if they're using them to avoid shipping restrictions.


[27-Apr-25 04:51 PM] potaterror#0000
A healthy syndicate is almost certainly encouraging multiple pro licenses to remain active.


[27-Apr-25 04:51 PM] jcheung#0000
this game benefits massively from having a larger player base


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] manhim#0000
The costs scale with that too


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] jcheung#0000
retaining people who have demonstrated interest in the past and keeping them engaged is more useful than squeezing them for every dime


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] manhim#0000
So they would have to raise the price for everyone else


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] jcheung#0000
costs scale, but so does your income


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] manhim#0000

you have incentives


[27-Apr-25 04:52 PM] potaterror#0000
Ultimately Molp is probably the only one that really knows how cost per player scales, so that's kind of a judgement call on his part.

i'm not saying to make the whole thing f2p

i don't think the current BASIC system is why people don't return.

every reason i've seen someone leave is because they stopped finding the game fun, including myself. it was never about the money. they don't return because their issue with the game hasn't been rectified, or maybe they just don't find it fun anymore for personal reasons

Yeah, long-term players who have burned out due to tedium are almost certainly not going to stay on basic for any time at all -- it's just even more tedium. Players who roll up operations because an issue hasn't been addressed _might_ come back if it does get addressed or go into "life support" with a smaller empire on basic if it wasn't a ton of extra tedium.

in 6 months i might be able to


[27-Apr-25 05:00 PM] jcheung#0000
but if i'm forced out of the game between the time that i have pro lapse and when i can afford to get pro again


[27-Apr-25 05:00 PM] jcheung#0000
then i won't get pro again


[27-Apr-25 05:01 PM] manhim#0000
And if basic would be enough for you, you wouldn't get pro at all. Specially if you can keep doing that for 6 months+


[27-Apr-25 05:01 PM] potaterror#0000
IDK, maybe I'll create a proper post on this later, not that I expect it'll get dev traction...but still, worth a try.

honestly the pro licence is cheap as.. I don't think  the public playing this game is short of money, rather time. and if fun isn't there, time becomes invaluable

Well this game is cheap when you are buying it from a western wealthy country. And only if you have a stable source of income.
But the game is also played by a younger audience and from countries with weaker economies, where the pricetag is way higher in comparison

If there are no current jobs for that pop tier, best to leave it at zero. Problem with getting population in a tier that doesn't have any jobs.....   1 worker with zero jobs = 100% unemployment = 0% happiness. Happiness gets averaged out over several weeks. So, as counter intuitive as it may be, if there's zero jobs for engineers, having zero engineers is the best way to quickly fill pop when a new base goes down.

This might not be that easy to manage, you may get some tech's moving up through education anyway.

The main problem (from a dev standpoint) with recurring orders is that they incur CPU and memory costs without any player interaction. For me, it sounds reasonable not to allow non-paying users to create additional running costs.

Banks as an official game mechanic
Banks have been floating around PrUn functionally for a long time now. Lowstrife has offered his loans since before I joined the game. Then there was Shrewdbank. And before Insula vanished, he also ran a sort of bank like organization. Now you have organizations like ADI or BEST that offer new members grants. And you still have Schaitr‚Äôs cheap...

I really like idea of an Antarean bank, where people can invest their money into and let it work. 
Tho without any game-supporting mechanisms, most of the management would be via semi-manual sheets.


[28-Apr-25 05:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But then again, 3% is more or less the highest interest rate you can do, since lowstrife is capping the market

[28-Apr-25 05:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, I know. I just really like the idea of an Antares Central Bank üòÇüòÇüòÇ


[28-Apr-25 06:24 AM] evov#0000
In theory - loans / banking is a good idea. High permit players have a hard time getting the same rate of return on their capital that low permit players can get. So it makes sense for high permit players to loan capital to low permit players and the profits from a high rate of return get split.

BUT . . . 
1. It's hard to securitize loans in the game. People borrow lots from multiple places, play for a month or two and quit without paying back the loans. So it's a difficult problem to attribute risk.

2. From my perspective - it's just very un-interesting. Having fat stacks of capital sitting around allows me to do things that feel more fun and engaging than simply loaning it out for some low % rate of return.

I think the ANT Central Bank idea sounds cool and interesting in theory, but there's a few major hurdles there that would need to be solved before I'd think about putting AIC towards helping back it.


[28-Apr-25 06:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The problem with people loaning out money and just leaving is obviously not solvable, but could be minimised by having a ‚Äúbackground check‚Äù for every application. Tho additional bureaucracy in a game is always a hurdle for borrower and lender. That‚Äôs probably the reason, why lowstrife mostly just accepts contracts send to them.


[28-Apr-25 06:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, the story of shrewdsun shows how risky it can be to lend out other peoples money. Especially if they expect some fixed ROI


[28-Apr-25 07:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
By ‚Äúbackground check‚Äù I mean a screenshot of XIT FIN and XIT FINPR, days online and maybe a ‚Äúcredit score‚Äù by already payed loans .


[28-Apr-25 07:12 AM] realharvey#0000
No one would want to do this much work for 3% interest

And you have to use those 3% otherwise you can't compete with lowstrife


[28-Apr-25 07:13 AM] realharvey#0000
Lowstrife has publicly said that he isn't making any money with it, because that interest barely covers the loans that are not paid back

Then there won‚Äôt be an Antarean bank I guess


[28-Apr-25 07:42 AM] bishopsix#0000
TFIN: No worries, our very own Antarean ~~loansharks~~ private entity loaners can and will help you! Whether you want it or not!


[28-Apr-25 07:44 AM] bishopsix#0000
But yeah I kinda agree a bank would be a bit of an overhead


[28-Apr-25 07:45 AM] bishopsix#0000
I would actually prefer a simple system like Heroes of Might and Magic 7 had, where there is a small interest rate for X days and you can take a max of 100k. It like doesn't help help, but its at least there?


[28-Apr-25 07:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I just noticed how absurdly low 3% interest are üòÖüôà 10 mil return 300k interest


[28-Apr-25 07:55 AM] realharvey#0000
Interest is usually calculated per week so there is a little bit more coming out of it


[28-Apr-25 07:56 AM] realharvey#0000
But due to how the game works the risk of loans not getting payed back due to leaving the game is to high


[28-Apr-25 07:56 AM] realharvey#0000
To really make this a business in the game interest rates would need to be way higher to address this.

[28-Apr-25 08:10 AM] jvaler#0000
i've seen 2 deposit systems tried so far and they've had 2 outcomes: losing a bunch of money due to overzealous lending, or not being able to invest their money fast enough due to low loan demand(because of lowstrife i presume)


[28-Apr-25 08:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
lol


[28-Apr-25 08:11 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, aslong and lowstrife keeps giving loans, I dont think anyone else can compete


[28-Apr-25 08:21 AM] laaxus#0000
the only way to compete would be to lower the inherent risk


[28-Apr-25 08:21 AM] laaxus#0000
it means : talking more with the loaner so that he doesn't fail

Yep. One side perk of some of the bfabs is that they're so frequently at/near the MM that having a stake in a production syndicate means  an easy way to move currencies. Well, if you ever get a surplus, that is. Stockpiling for vibes-based logistics ease can make that take a long while, I'm finding out.

how comes fixed asset does not show my ships ?

and no bases either, how ever it does show my base section which is what?

can anyone explains this part of the balance statement FINBS ?

Which cargo bay ship is most popular? 2k or WCB?


[28-Apr-25 10:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Depends


[28-Apr-25 10:35 PM] getonthetrain#0000
just in general


[28-Apr-25 10:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
LCB probably


[28-Apr-25 10:36 PM] jab.sh#0000
I like 2k but for heavy stuff like ores and metals the WCB is better


[28-Apr-25 10:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yep


[28-Apr-25 10:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Unless it‚Äôs ALO than LCB is better

The easiest explanation is: only use XIT FIN stuff. The vanilla stuff is useless which is why RPRUN has its own fin stats

I hope someone is expanding C production as the new MM is going to majorly up demand


[29-Apr-25 09:51 AM] jhyn.#0000
So would agriculture or food processing be more needed long-term in Harmonia? I do have two food experts


[29-Apr-25 09:51 AM] jhyn.#0000
or should I try to do 50/50 and minimize shipping


[29-Apr-25 09:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
@jhyn. The CoGC has a voting cycle of what industry to boost, so theoretically it can change but they rarely ever do especially on big planets.


[29-Apr-25 09:52 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Long term Agri would be better


[29-Apr-25 09:52 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You can build on a planet with a food processing CoGC later

Would you recommend going full specialisation on your first base to begin with?

or should we focus on producing just one output

Yes you could

But like what recipes you run depends on what you want to do with the out puts


[29-Apr-25 09:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs the most efficient meta


[29-Apr-25 09:55 AM] bishopsix#0000
tfw spreadsheet meta


[29-Apr-25 09:56 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So every day you use X amount of RAT, DW, OVE, COF and PWO, but that doesn‚Äôt increase if you make more stuff by having more experts, or other efficiency bonuses like CoGC


[29-Apr-25 09:56 AM] jhyn.#0000
so minimizing shipping is not a big goal


[29-Apr-25 09:56 AM] .urpalhal#0000
No


[29-Apr-25 09:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
We offer kits to upgrade your starter ships here


[29-Apr-25 09:58 AM] jhyn.#0000
Btw do you recommend buying COF for pioneers? The math looks nonobvious


[29-Apr-25 09:58 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[29-Apr-25 09:58 AM] .urpalhal#0000
COF and PWO boost your efficiency


[29-Apr-25 09:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would check out prunplanner.com


[29-Apr-25 09:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
In #agp-information there is a video about how to use it


[29-Apr-25 09:59 AM] bishopsix#0000
one thing I learned early on Jhyn is that prunplanner is king, also having 2 luxury resources is always worth it


[29-Apr-25 10:00 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It can show you what recipes are worth running and what buildings to build and how COF and PWO will help or not


[29-Apr-25 10:00 AM] jhyn.#0000
It's like, I know myself and I'll be there in one month, but I don't want to burn myself out by having all 100% efficient decisions day one

No yeah fair fair


[29-Apr-25 10:01 AM] bishopsix#0000
the first day I played I set up everything and then a week went by just planning in prunplanner and talking with people

It's best to just take it at a pace that you learn to understand the little things and then build up from there.

In every game there is the discovery phase where you understand stuff screen by screen, and you don't get those feelings back later

@jhyn. answering the question you put in harmonia planet chat, no the CoGC isnt permenant, but in most cases it might aswell be since the people on that planet most likely already have production that benefits from the CoGC, so they will always vote to keep that bonus

You should see how long it takes to get pop when you're the first one to put a base on a planet. This base has been down for nearly 2 week.

[30-Apr-25 01:08 AM] evov#0000
It's an unfortunate point of the game. High pop planets get pop faster, and there isn't really enough of a downside to it. So the tendency is population around the universe is very clustered around a few large planets. I think it would be a more interesting universe if the population was more spread out. If there were more compelling reasons to move to less populated / more distant planets.

[30-Apr-25 01:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The changes to the pop upkeep should make it easier to accumulate pop, tho the inherit problem of getting to a reasonable pop level stays


[30-Apr-25 01:10 AM] evov#0000
Not for new/small planets. I don't think it'll make a big difference there tbh. The increased education rates will help with larger planets that have a lot of low tier workforce they don't need though.


[30-Apr-25 01:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I guess somebody has to be the first one to settle for those distant planets


[30-Apr-25 01:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Another problem is the absence of a CX / the long distance to one


[30-Apr-25 01:13 AM] evov#0000
I think the devs have spoken about it in the past. The "intent" was that you'd get better / more resource rich planets as you move away from the CX's. But something about the initial seeding of the universe didn't go as planned.


[30-Apr-25 01:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Still - If I look at some resource extraction planets we currently have, you'll need at least a ship full time to export all of it. If they get richer the farther you're away, the more shipping you need.

[30-Apr-25 01:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But the fact, that e.g. NC2 is basically empty and CI2 very low populated, shows, that there is not enough incentive to populate the outer skirts of the universe

[30-Apr-25 10:50 AM] realharvey#0000
currently a lot of bases do 100k per day, so there is still some room in the price trend upwards before it could be considered expensive for its price


[30-Apr-25 11:00 AM] jhyn.#0000
Quick newbie question, is flying with a full tank less efficient than flying with only the fuel you need (like more mass -> more fuel consumed)?


[30-Apr-25 11:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
there is barely a difference


[30-Apr-25 11:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
noticable difference only occurs when you have thousands of tons of stuff


[30-Apr-25 11:03 AM] jhyn.#0000
alrighty, so no need to bother counting how much fuel you need, thanks


[30-Apr-25 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
actually, you should always try to fly with tank full


[30-Apr-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
because having a ship stranded is quite unpleasant


[30-Apr-25 11:22 AM] realharvey#0000
It also prevents you from: whoops I have no money for fuel


[30-Apr-25 11:39 AM] jcheung#0000
With the starter ship, even full/empty cargo bay isn't enough to matter. The engine is strong enough to be limited by Gs rather than power.


[30-Apr-25 11:40 AM] jcheung#0000
At larger ship scales, a fully loaded ship has so much mass that your fuel tanks won't make a huge differencr


[30-Apr-25 11:41 AM] jcheung#0000
That said, the sliders are based off of how much fuel you have on the tank, so if you want to add a few hours to your travel and save some fuel because you're going to be sleeping


[30-Apr-25 11:41 AM] jcheung#0000
You can put some fuel aside to be able to access a lower range


[30-Apr-25 11:42 AM] jcheung#0000
There's still going to be a minimum you hit eventually, but it's going to be lower than that of a full tank


[30-Apr-25 11:42 AM] jcheung#0000

While it does not sounds like much, I do think that being able to sort out your ship in your FLT buffer should be available.

Either being able to sort them:
- alphabetically
- type
- distance from a certain points
- fuel left in the tank
- integrity
- manually (for a specific group)

it doesn't really matter when you can just add more ships to your fleet


[01-May-25 04:03 AM] realharvey#0000
I have 2 more 5k/5k and 2 more 3k/1k ordered


[01-May-25 04:03 AM] realharvey#0000
and the slow down from reparis


[01-May-25 04:03 AM] realharvey#0000
not so important


[01-May-25 04:05 AM] vanarazor#0000
Ok I trust you if you say so,


[01-May-25 05:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Those numbers are really tame tbh


[01-May-25 05:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Somebody came up with like less then 10% or so


[01-May-25 05:30 AM] laaxus#0000
@razenpok do you think we could configure ourselves the color for the ship repair ?


[01-May-25 05:33 AM] razenpok#0000
Why do you want to configure it?


[01-May-25 05:36 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't believe 80% is worthy of red


[01-May-25 05:36 AM] laaxus#0000
I would personally put 80-100% to green 65-80 to yellow and <65 to red


[01-May-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
not a big deal tho


[01-May-25 05:37 AM] razenpok#0000
Why these numbers?


[01-May-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
personnal preference


[01-May-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
in short, I don't repair a ship above 80%


[01-May-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
so going from fine to "YOU NEED TO REPAIR IT" in 1d feels abrupt


[01-May-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
again, not a big deal


[01-May-25 05:38 AM] razenpok#0000
idk, currently
yellow = will start to slow down soon
red = experiencing a slowdown


[01-May-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
ikik


[01-May-25 05:40 AM] razenpok#0000
What might be better is to figure out the condition-slowdown curve and lerp between yellow and red according to it


[01-May-25 05:41 AM] razenpok#0000
So it starts at 80% yellow, goes through orange somewhere in the middle, and ends up in red at 0%

[01-May-25 05:41 AM] razenpok#0000
Or maybe it's a dumb idea


[01-May-25 05:46 AM] razenpok#0000
Btw what do you mean by
> going from fine to "YOU NEED TO REPAIR IT" in 1d feels abrupt

Currently it changes to yellow at 85%, and to red at 80%. Going through 5% of the ship condition takes much more than a day, no?


[01-May-25 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
in my head, above 80% is fine, don't care

but red is associated with urgent/bad


[01-May-25 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
it's just monkey brains things


[01-May-25 05:57 AM] realharvey#0000
I agree that 80% is a little harsh for being red


[01-May-25 05:57 AM] realharvey#0000
But I also forgot that I could just turn it off


[01-May-25 07:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
finally reached 100m equity ü•≥

good progress!


[01-May-25 08:12 AM] realharvey#0000
line must go up


[01-May-25 08:56 AM] laaxus#0000
@shipyards I heavily recommend to install Refined prun and use prunplanner, if you don't already


[01-May-25 08:56 AM] shipyards#0000
I use prun planner and better prun browser extension


[01-May-25 08:56 AM] jcheung#0000
not familiar with prun browser extension


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] shipyards#0000
it just adds some QOL to the game when using the browser version


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] shipyards#0000
its called "PMMG extended"


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] jcheung#0000
rprun is its replacement


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] laaxus#0000
ah yes


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] jcheung#0000
pmmg is depreciated


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] laaxus#0000
Refined Prun is pmmg but better


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] shipyards#0000
ah okay


[01-May-25 08:57 AM] shipyards#0000
thx ill switch to that


[01-May-25 08:58 AM] jcheung#0000
should be an easy transition too


[01-May-25 08:58 AM] jcheung#0000
that being said, pmmg is better than nothing üòÑ


[01-May-25 08:58 AM] laaxus#0000
if you ever want to take a look at our grant program, it's #agp-information #agp-operations


[01-May-25 08:59 AM] shipyards#0000
thats pretty neat, i like the backgrounds on the items


[01-May-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
no obligation no pressure however


[01-May-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
RPrun is that much better

you probably don't have enough playtime to spot all the differences, but it's a lot deeper than the images üòÑ


[01-May-25 09:00 AM] jcheung#0000
here's a useful one. `xit burn_all`


[01-May-25 09:01 AM] shipyards#0000
ive been playing for 3 years, just restarted recently though cuz i hadn't played in 5 months

eh


[01-May-25 09:01 AM] jcheung#0000
i should use those more


[01-May-25 09:03 AM] shipyards#0000
could i get the grant approved for a base near Moria? I have a friend over there thats new to the game and i'd like to have a base next to him


[01-May-25 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
no, the grant is exclusively to develop antares


[01-May-25 09:04 AM] shipyards#0000
Aight i figured


[01-May-25 09:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But there is a grant program in Moria, too, isn‚Äôt there?


[01-May-25 09:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could ask those people


[01-May-25 09:04 AM] shipyards#0000
yeah I might, i'd rather stick with antares, i've always played in ANT space

I keep hearing about it


[01-May-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
but never saw any ad


[01-May-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
or anything tbh


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] tanda#0000
I've been calling out that fact in global chats periodically


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] tanda#0000
I heard someone from GTU tell me they were "working on it"


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] tanda#0000

[01-May-25 09:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Ah, wait. Moria is Hortus?


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] tanda#0000
It's the richest region with the oldest players and somehow they don't have any programs set up


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
What region is BEST again?


[01-May-25 09:07 AM] laaxus#0000
benten


[01-May-25 09:07 AM] tanda#0000
Hortus has the IDA now, run by COSM


[01-May-25 09:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Ah, right


[01-May-25 09:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So Moria are the yellow ones, aren‚Äôt they?


[01-May-25 09:08 AM] jcheung#0000
it goes

MOR | BEN

[01-May-25 09:08 AM] shipyards#0000
Could i get like a half grant to just double my current base? it makes RAT, KOM, and COF


[01-May-25 09:09 AM] laaxus#0000
that's something to talk in #agp-operations but that seems perfectly doable

[01-May-25 09:10 AM] tanda#0000
I'm not going to say "same" because of Malahat, but my focus is almost entirely ANT, with maybe later expansions being targeted at BEN space


[01-May-25 09:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, I have an IDC base in Malahat I hope to decommission after the update üòÖ but it‚Äôs completely disconnected from my empire and is managed via contracts to allocator üòÇ


[01-May-25 09:14 AM] shipyards#0000
aight i put my base plans in #agp-operations


[01-May-25 12:10 PM] jab.sh#0000
so are you saying if I move some fuel from fuel tanks to cargo, it will let me use less fuel (the slider can go lower)?


[01-May-25 12:10 PM] jcheung#0000
yes


[01-May-25 12:11 PM] jcheung#0000
to a degree


[01-May-25 12:11 PM] jab.sh#0000

[01-May-25 01:12 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
it escapes me too. It also feels like MOR has no "group" of people


[01-May-25 01:12 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
MOR feels hollow üòÖ


[01-May-25 01:13 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
like Hortus has Cosmocene and IDA, Antares has ADI, AA, etc. Benten has BEST, KAWA, FIOC, what about MOR?


[01-May-25 01:16 PM] mevnav#0000
Yet more relevant conversation to my plan to moving to Antares. I was in the main PRUN server and heard that there was basically no new-player initiatives in MOR and was like "Wait that's where I am"


[01-May-25 01:18 PM] mevnav#0000
idk why nobody has set one up in that corner yet

that's because only ***MAJOR*** region have one üòÑ


[01-May-25 01:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
MOR is the true free market. Just a ton of individuals who don‚Äôt cooperate with each other at all üòÑ

Benten also has a great grant program

lowstrife could probably monopolise in so many markets
