Also, the first trade with the KAWA Trade List was a success so I want to post the list here again and remind everyone what I'm offering. This is new so availability may vary as I sort out logistics, but **I'm willing to trade any green item on this list for any red item** ***lower on the list***. The larger the gap the better the deal will be.

Trade ratios are based on average prices across *all* CXs, so be sure to check against ANT prices and other internal offers, but most of these deals are pretty good, *especially* for items that sell cheaper at ANT like AL...

So if you sell a red item be sure to check the list before heading to CX, and if you want something that's *not* listed as a green item just ask me and I'll see what I can do! 😊
