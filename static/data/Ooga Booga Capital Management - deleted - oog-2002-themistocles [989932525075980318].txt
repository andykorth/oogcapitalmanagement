[27-Jun-22 12:54 PM] insensless72#0000
Where are you headed from Deimos?


[27-Jun-22 01:01 PM] jackinabox86#0000
doing a shipping contract for a couple days, but then open to whatever is needed


[29-Jun-22 12:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
@Deimos This ship is sitting idle here.  Anyone need anything moved?


[29-Jun-22 12:37 PM] insensless72#0000
Where do you plan on Flying?


[29-Jun-22 12:37 PM] insensless72#0000
I have things that can go Nike or Heph, though Tang is taking Tayra to heph shortly


[29-Jun-22 12:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
happy to go to Nike or wherever.  I need to know where people want it to go.


[29-Jun-22 12:39 PM] insensless72#0000
Deimos -> Nike -> Harmonia? I need quite a lot moved off Harmonia


[29-Jun-22 12:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Harmonia back to Nike or?


[29-Jun-22 12:39 PM] insensless72#0000
Nike or Deimos either


[29-Jun-22 12:39 PM] insensless72#0000
im not on Phobos


[29-Jun-22 12:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
cool.  Probably Deimos, but we can see if there's big demand for Nike


[29-Jun-22 12:40 PM] insensless72#0000
Deimos will have the most demand


[29-Jun-22 12:40 PM] allocater#0000

[29-Jun-22 12:47 PM] allocater#0000
I can move the AL I have, if I know it's refilled in 4.5h üëç

@Nike 1973t/m available to @Harmonia tomorrow morning, so prep ads


[29-Jun-22 07:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@churavis are you still doing BMP out there? This is a chance to get a disgusting amount of LST


[29-Jun-22 07:32 PM] churavis#0000
I am but MCG is not as lucrative as other things now so I mostly only make it for upkeep or corp needs and have plenty of LST stockpiled already


[29-Jun-22 07:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Fair enough, I am selfishly looking for ways to get the stuff off planet.


[29-Jun-22 07:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I can take it on a GAL run in a few days to BEN


[29-Jun-22 07:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
