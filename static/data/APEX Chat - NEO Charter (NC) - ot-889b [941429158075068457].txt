**Lekvarky**:	Anyone making WOR? I would like 7 for the planet's ART.


[16-Jul-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I don't normally make them but I do have a UPF on OT-889e - so if nobody else steps up DM me and we can talk about cost and timing.

**dakota1234**:	for whatever reason in my head the i is silent


[06-Aug-24 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I pronounce it more phonetically, such as G-T-U. G (Jee) - T (ti) - U (yu)

**Lekvarky**:	Hey guys, I think someone with PRO is paying taxes through the old system. Please make sure your production orders pay taxes to Government of Kallista - Jeetiyu and recreate them if not. Thanks ;).


[11-Oct-24 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	mine is fin

[11-Oct-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yeah, mine is fine too... weird.


[11-Oct-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I'm curious why you think that someone on pro is paying the old system?


[11-Oct-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	We are getting ~45k/wk into the corp instead of the planet bank :).


[11-Oct-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Lekvarky how? This looks more like a bug, maybe report in the Prun Discord?


[11-Oct-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	My understanding of the recurring orders was that it made the one that was queued and made a new one to replace the once started into production.  Indeed sounds like a bug.


[11-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I wonder if its a bugged COLIQ account?


[11-Oct-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	There is probably some kind of bug... the corp I created for Berthier still receives a few ICA of revenue every week even though the new system has been in place for months.


[11-Oct-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I saw somebody else mention having the same thing. I can't remember where.

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	If people have a recurring order that they setup before the change (like a single BMP that has been churning out PE for like 3 years) - it will still do the old taxes sometimes.


[12-Nov-24 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Its not a bug. Its the reminiscence of the old system, old bases still running


[14-Nov-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I like that "its the reminiscence of the old system" - next time we find something burried in the corporate code I will use that one - mainly they just blame it on old mainframe cold.

[08-Dec-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**mast3rd3mon**:	Everyone need not be alarmed if you've seen the payout motion. It turns out I've not paid Lekvarky for the planet upkeep in probably 4-6 months or something insane. This is just a long overdue payout to the guy who keeps the whole planet running


[14-Apr-25 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Actually, it turns out its been over 10 months, as theres no gov motion for a payout, meaning the last payout was under the old gov system

[14-Apr-25 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	my idc on malahat will go to 6700profit lol


[14-Apr-25 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	for the whole base?


[14-Apr-25 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	that's what prunplanner says @11000


[14-Apr-25 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	whole base is basically a wash at 11k/idc


[14-Apr-25 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	currently IDC is pretty bad, since the price of MEA is too high.


[14-Apr-25 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Its most likely gonna kill the game for a lot of people


[14-Apr-25 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	well, not THAT bad, but nowhere near where it was before MEA


[14-Apr-25 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I like it, but I'm also not an IDC printer.


[14-Apr-25 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I assume having to worry about supply lines is something that might be annoying if you don't want to.


[14-Apr-25 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I had a plan to convert a whole system into electronics stuff, which I was then gonna use all the profits towards making a ship factory line somewhere, so I could sell nearer to cost to make upgrades and stuff cheaper


[14-Apr-25 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	prunplanner is reading MEA at 9419 so that's why the profit shows so low


[14-Apr-25 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	electronics will still be super important.


[14-Apr-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	the next 2 best MM's are AIR and CCD I think, which use a ton of electronics.


[14-Apr-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	yeah, but they arent getting nerfed into the ground


[14-Apr-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	they're getting buffed


[14-Apr-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i have a 904 area plan for phobos making 5.14 snm/day


[14-Apr-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	and WAI/SAR will be very important.


[14-Apr-25 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	might as well do it here instead Dzentak, less taxes


[14-Apr-25 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	good point


[14-Apr-25 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i'm straight idc here but needing major repairs


[14-Apr-25 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I'd just consider reworking any IDC bases the next time repairs come around.


[14-Apr-25 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	might as well run it down instead of repairing, and then swap over. Pretty sure taxes here are 25-30% of those on phobos


[14-Apr-25 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	when i finish work ill hop back into the main PU discord and see if I can talk sense into anyone. EDC at 10k is still a good reduction while not killing off peoples bases, maybe try to go for 13k low end for IDC? although I dont make any so would need someones advice if 13k is a good compromise between a nerf and a nerf into the ground


[14-Apr-25 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Posed the question to people in there, gonna see what the outcome is


[14-Apr-25 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	I am hearing there is discussion on Discord about our planet being mismanaged lol. I ready don't feel like going there just to explain ppl they don't know what they are talking about :). If you have any questions, pls post them here ;).


[14-Apr-25 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	No compliants here


[14-Apr-25 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	this planet or Phobos?


[14-Apr-25 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Both seem like odd claims.


[14-Apr-25 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	this one, Phobos def is mismanaged, at least it was last time I was checking few months ago hehe, it was never managed properly, that's why my base there is empty :)


[14-Apr-25 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	What's wrong with the management of Phobos?


[14-Apr-25 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	maybe it's ok now, as I said, I didn't check recently


[14-Apr-25 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i'm probably going to shutter this base. i've been thinking about it for a while now, saw this coming... and because i'm across the universe getting out here has sucked


[14-Apr-25 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	lek: what was wrong with phobos in the past?


[14-Apr-25 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	negative eng and sci numbers, often


[14-Apr-25 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	seems alright.


[14-Apr-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	I am just checking, -1000 sci 14 weeks in a row? lool


[14-Apr-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	the current discord discussion AFAIK is about taxes on Phobos.


[14-Apr-25 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	ah, ok :)


[14-Apr-25 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	how is it even possible, that there are sci bases there, when there is 10% sci missing basically permanently


[14-Apr-25 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	SCI pops take a while to grow, so having a deficit while more people are bandwagoning onto the IDC train is to be expected. The number of SCI was growing at a reasonable rate except for 1 week 47 days ago.


[14-Apr-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	it's a popular planet, so people were planting SCI bases even when there was a deficit of 1000 SCI.


[14-Apr-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	nothing the gov can do about that.


[14-Apr-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i love that 463 sci education on jeetiyu


[14-Apr-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i would like to learn to implement that elsewhere :p


[14-Apr-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	step 1 have 16k engineers.


[14-Apr-25 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i guess stockpile technicians and go from there?


[14-Apr-25 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	sure he can, UNI and LIB are lvl 4 and 1 and fulfilment was never nowhere near 100%


[14-Apr-25 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	the phobos SCI growth is like max 10% of what it could be


[14-Apr-25 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	step 1 is upgrade LIB and UNI


[14-Apr-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	most important thing to get eng and sci


[14-Apr-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i would like to fatten up vh-331b


[14-Apr-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	low budget though, only got uni2 so far


[14-Apr-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	LIB and UNI give passive education bonus how many eng and sci are educated-up each week


[14-Apr-25 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	dont have any lib yet, and i've been feeding idc to the uni


[14-Apr-25 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	first levels are really strong


[14-Apr-25 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	I think it's like 0.4% 0.2% 0.1% for UNI, LIB, PBH, while base is like 0.5%, but I don' remember exactly and it changed


[14-Apr-25 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	per level


[14-Apr-25 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	so it's worth buying just the building and not trying to source random consumables for those?


[14-Apr-25 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	yes, no feeding required


[14-Apr-25 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	it just needs to be enabled


[14-Apr-25 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	feeding edu is not worth at all, it costs a LOT of money, that main reason we have so low taxes, because we don't feed LIB UNI\


[14-Apr-25 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	also, it's pretty easy to get SCI, ENG are much harder


[14-Apr-25 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	makes sense, too much edu would bleed the eng out


[14-Apr-25 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	üëç


[14-Apr-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	phobos has it easier since it has more tech than we do, for this planet it's pretty hard to keep engs healthy


[14-Apr-25 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	phobos is a starter planet so they have to deal with high pio population too


[14-Apr-25 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	keeping pio happy is really cheap


[14-Apr-25 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Anyways, I think governors should be able to take some profit from the taxes.


[14-Apr-25 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	I have tons of money, I don't need profit from taxes :D


[14-Apr-25 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	keeping PIO happy is cheap, but trying to keep PIO/SET numbers down to lower upkeep costs is probably the issue.


[14-Apr-25 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I'm not a governor so I don't really know all that much.


[14-Apr-25 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	upgrade LIB UNI and feed everything to same level, except edu and you have no problem


[14-Apr-25 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	It's hard to guess what numbers are ideal for phobos, they feed it chaotically :), the numbers jump all over the place


[14-Apr-25 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i mean, phobos sci shortage will probably sort itself out here in the next 2 months


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	it depends... it was always like this on phobos, few cycles it looked like it will be fine and then it went into red numbers for months again


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	my personal guess - next month the Sci shortage will be gone, since IDC is getting nerfed again.


[14-Apr-25 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	the best MM's are going to need a lot less SCI pops.


[14-Apr-25 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	idk about gone, but reduced


[14-Apr-25 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	if you have bases there, you should convince the governor to build UNI LIB at least few levels, phobos might be fine without feeding both Culture and Education and thus spending almost nothing compared to now.


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	and have no problems with eng and sci is given

[16-Apr-25 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Apr-25 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Apr-25 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Apr-25 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-25 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ragadais**:	makes sense. I got into IDC because I only have to log in like once a week. keep 60 days of resources everywhere, just scoot some ships around lazily. most of the other profitable goods would be hard to make on a basic license with only 2 ships moving at a time.
