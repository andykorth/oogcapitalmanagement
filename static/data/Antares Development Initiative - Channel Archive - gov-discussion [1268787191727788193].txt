Howdy Folks. The purposes of these channels are to support education on governance, ask and answer questions for help and advice, to advocate and support capable candidates for Parliament positions(should they prove themselves reliable and capable), and to create connections for all Antares people looking to find reasonably price materials to support their planets.

I would like to preface and say that I would like all discussion on actions and behaviors to be limited to post-June 2024 Politics changes. This is a new chance and clean slate for all.

@riseoffilth how many HAB and WOR do you have for sale? I'm still doing the math on how many I need, but it's probably a lot... Also, you listed GL, just GL? no TUB?...

So what is the purpose of the lower members of Parliament.
Is it to nuisance and diffuse the power that the near monarchical governor used to have?


[03-Aug-24 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Backup if someone goes inactive


[03-Aug-24 03:57 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yes and yes.


[03-Aug-24 03:58 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
mostly the diffusion of power to create a system where the governing actually involves some politics. But they also specifically made it so that even small planets have 1 MP just in case the GOV goes inactive


[03-Aug-24 04:21 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and if gov is being shit on larger planets, the ability to overrule


[07-Aug-24 04:54 PM] jvaler#0000
ENG are a problem on SE-648b, and the solution i decided on was to bump the art cafe up to 2 inputs because both comfort and culture seem to be low.
should i be upgrading it instead? idk if it will cost less that way in the long run

@jvaler Hey, what are the taxes like on planet?


[07-Aug-24 06:32 PM] riseoffilth#0000
money in wallet


[07-Aug-24 06:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
for the record, your use of KOM on the wellness center as an input has a 3x higher cost than if you have used DW


[07-Aug-24 06:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and thats assuming KOM is 450/u, which... it is not.


[07-Aug-24 06:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
so really, its closer to double that. 6x more expensive than using DW

[07-Aug-24 06:36 PM] riseoffilth#0000
additionally, you shouldnt have put GL in the Art cafe. It is going to mostly be wasted because its capped... and even then, its way overdone


[07-Aug-24 06:36 PM] riseoffilth#0000
whoever built those structures is a fucking idiot


[07-Aug-24 06:36 PM] riseoffilth#0000
or at least, whoever did the wellness center


[07-Aug-24 06:38 PM] riseoffilth#0000
But my advice going forward is, only supply OFF to the SST, DW to the wellness center, and DW to the Art cafe. You should be able to run the planet at 120k a month


[07-Aug-24 06:38 PM] jvaler#0000
wait capped? i saw that pop up on archiel's sheet but then it disappeared after some fiddling


[07-Aug-24 06:38 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[07-Aug-24 06:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000

they're staying static and not growing though lol


[07-Aug-24 06:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
This is a small planet with a razor thin budget


[07-Aug-24 06:41 PM] jvaler#0000
oh you're right, it does say capped


[07-Aug-24 06:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Thats because Martinc1194 didnt provide upkeep and let it lapse. I couldnt do anything because I cant speak in planet comms, and I dont have a base there, so I cannot put things in the POPI


[07-Aug-24 06:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I even warned him that popi was running out


[07-Aug-24 06:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
last popr is his failure


[07-Aug-24 06:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but he left the planet because its gone RES cogc


[07-Aug-24 06:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
so i guess that his way to say "fuck you"


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
OH


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
so POPI was empty for longer than i realized


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
its been empty for 2 weeks


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
eek


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought it was just a blip cause i saw some remnants of upkeep in there before i refilled it all


[07-Aug-24 06:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I'm sorry I didnt reach out to you sooner since I asked you to step up. It slipped my mind completely


[07-Aug-24 06:44 PM] jvaler#0000
it's all good lol


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
unfortunately, Xepoiv is a useless dumbfuck who doesnt speak in any channel or respond to DMs, but runs on these smaller planets and gets the occasional seats, and then blocks any motion from passing in under 24 hours


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
so i'll just wait for POPR to settle and see what happens. and switch to all DW and not refill the GL


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
OFF is cheaper for SST


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah sorry OFF, DW, DW


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
forgot SST had a DW input


[07-Aug-24 06:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
if he wasnt there, or someone who was willing to contribute and vote was there, you could run a FES 3 and at least try and mitigate pop loss for this cycle


[07-Aug-24 06:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but now because of him being there, you cannot under 24 hours


[07-Aug-24 06:46 PM] jvaler#0000
i filled it like a week ago it shouldn't be too bad


[07-Aug-24 06:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000

Ooo, new content! I'll just offer my immediate thing, per that planet, via jvalers issue.


[08-Aug-24 07:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you're looking to upgrade POPI buildings, you should start with the smalls'. They don't offer the best satisfaction benefits..... but they're just bfabs, and not l/r/a-fabs...... These building costs scale, every level as well.?

You can pad out the SST/PAR with just DW, and the INF with just OFF. Why? Because I'm looking that the most favourite need requirements of each POPR tier [ PIO-life support; SET-safety; TEC-health; ENG-comfort, and SCI-culture and education ]. The SCI's are just pure expense, compared to what the current universe has built up (we're just barely discussing shipbuilding en-large. Most of the SCI requirements are not involved in direct shipbuilding + there is no market for them, unless you're going to produce/pay for what's currently on sale)...

I think I recently built a WCE on Pallada. That thing was 3x as much cost as the PAR was, on level equality... I'm just pointing out the efficiencies here, since these things will take alot of money to build, and a lot of time to pay back.

[08-Aug-24 07:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The point? Overbuild on the cheap stuff, and you can run rather efficiently, with purely basic COM inputs, for quite a while. If you get beyond that point, well I think we can have that discussion, on the more expensive POPI upgrades + upkeeps, at a later time? I don't think that we're just suited for dumping higher tier inputs into POPI needs, that aren't required, or easily attainable, through another means. Just my 2 cents.


[08-Aug-24 09:17 AM] riseoffilth#0000
I think the opposite. Dont overbuild. SST and INF's safety and happiness are not big requirements to higher pop happiness and are most impactful on PIO/SET. Overbuilding means excess pio/set pop, which reduces the effectiveness of all other fulfillments, and subsequently, lower high tier pop happiness

[08-Aug-24 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
LIB and broadcasting hub also provide a smaller passive education bonus. There should be an INF on that planet, which is just a handful of bfabs. Welness centers are an oddity that I generally don't recommend.

The "Mat Price Calc" sheet of Archiel's Governor Helper will help you find the $/unit satisfaction provided by each mat in each building. OFF in an INF is 3x-4x more efficient than DW in a wellness center.

You can use the top right corner of the first sheet to get a handle on what your engineer education rate is going to be at different levels of supply. If you're expecting to grow the planet, you'll probably need a park to efficiently supply the amounts of comfort you need. I didn't run the whole sheet though. On a brand new planet, I don't mind ACAs as a cheap way to max out your comfort and culture with a single building. But I do that for fresh planets with <1k people, because they saturate quickly, and DEC and COF in an ACA is incredibly costly.

[08-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect engineer immigration projects will be the cheapest way to fill those open jobs. There are some governors who would rather put the money into POPI and never run an unsponsored program, but ultimately I think it comes down to most effective way to fill the jobs per $ spent,  regardless of if it goes into a program or a POPI item. You can simulate both in the "Projected Growth" section of the sheet


[08-Aug-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
so i just finally looked at the program running on bober... is there any good reasonable reason it's running scientist immigration while set and tec both had open jobs? ü§î


[08-Aug-24 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
rather, what is the reason, is there no program for set and tec?


[08-Aug-24 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Last week's program (during that POPI report that was 6 days ago) was scientists. The current program on Bober is Festivities 3

You'll want those happinesses to be above 70% to really get migration going to close up those SET and TECH shortages, it looks like a little more safety and health would go a long way. They are growing pretty fast at the current rate, but there havve been open jobs for a few weeks


[08-Aug-24 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
One thing to notice is that 340 open SET jobs is the number before the change, and you gained 208 SET, so actual open jobs is like 130.


[08-Aug-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
tech had no migration because their happiness was between 50% and 70%. They had decent education growth. With the festival that will be 20% higher, and you'll get some growth across all tiers


[08-Aug-24 05:27 PM] jcheung#0000

[14-Aug-24 05:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm, I have a short-ish question. 

This ain't exactly Antares Area, but I'd think it would be a good example, to anyone who is/will find themselves in the same situation. I've read through Archiel's Gov Guide; the question regards anything that I might have missed, after parsing over that planets' stuff, over the past 3 days, since I'm backtracking for #reasons, while also having not much info, as I'm not directly responsible for its health/operation.

Basically #Verdant [  PLI YI-715b  ] | [  POPR YI-715b  ] | [  POPI YI-715b  ].

That planet is extremely heavy on the PIO side of the POPR, with severe unemployment. Running any POPI upkeep makes no sense, as it'll only be needless expense. Its main problem, lies with the #education_centipede --- losing PIOs, to SETs, who just migrate out due to the aforementioned unemployment. 

The best solution that I could come up with, is just to let the PIOs dwindle down to a set target figure (10-15k surplus PIOs), and then pulse (run full POPI + Festivities 3) for at least a week, to get a huge influx of spare PIOs, that will buffer out the POPR's weekly changes, for 2+ months, per job....

Is this the most cost-efficient approach to this sort of thing? Am I missing anything?

[14-Aug-24 06:52 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, occasionally waves of upkeep like is the cost effective method of managing unemployment like that from what I've heard. I haven't tried it myself yet though


[14-Aug-24 11:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Keep in mind there is a delayed effect from POPI satisfaction turning into happiness.


[14-Aug-24 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
So flipping to full POPI / empty POPI has a delayed effect. It is modeled in the javascript on the sheet, and I considered adding it "See that TODO on the projected true happy" line. But I don't really know of a way to show it to a user that is meaningful and useful to them- outside of some sort of multi-week population projection tool.


[14-Aug-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think there's a handful of possible techniques, but no obvious best answer. In particular for the sheet you posted for Verdant, your education centipede doesn't require any engineers or scientists.. so basically you just have unemployment across the board.


[14-Aug-24 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you have  260k PIOs with 8% unemployment plus 18k SET at 25% unemployment and 400 techs at 40% unemployment... you can basically ignore the SET and Techs. The percentage isn't important to upkeep, only the total is. And that's pretty close to 8% unemployment overall. which isn't a bad number. the set and techs don't contribute that much to the needs or costs of the planet (check the charts and tables in the bottom right of the sheet). 

As unemployment increases, the happiness of those tiers decrease, so the problem sort of solves itself, especially when employment of those tiers is low.

As far as educating up PIOs as a vector of PIO loss, I think your idea is a very good approach if you don't mind micromanaging it that way. A quick festival (or anything that pops you up to 75% happiness will give you a burst of workers in each tier that will take quite a while to bleed away

So I think the one thing ANT is missing that other regions have... we just have fewer starter planets. But I bet if we petitioned molp to build up another starter planet, as long as it's triple green, we could pick one with a nice COGC that is noob friendly. 

When new players are making starting planet choices, they are sort of picking randomly- they don't know ANT is the best. So us being down a couple planets really cuts into our fresh blood. Add the annoyance that Phobos isn't a great starting place anyway....


[16-Aug-24 10:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
people get way too excited about promitor, cause you can run a high efficiency base with a bunch of FRMs and wooooo, you got a 40k/d base like that's the epitome of base design. We could do way better with another COGC, even for noobs

[17-Aug-24 06:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, Antares is actually better suited for farming than Insitor is. All of those easily do FRM processes. The main issue is the water deposits --- there's not enough density here for high-volume HYF processes. Making the FIM/MEA and the dank drinks is not an issue, but the basic stuff is....

And the COGCs are determined by player votes - we all know this - but people dive straight in from the metrics/advice, to do what everyone else is doing.

So from early universe, to now, we have a bunch of players with some intense investment bias in keeping all of those planets AS-IS.

I do wonder though, if the early-universe meta priorities were different, we might be sitting in a #Green-Antares today.


[17-Aug-24 06:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Heh, out of the hundreds of players on Deimos.... Only 12 voted for the current COGC.


[17-Aug-24 06:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A random thought.... What if a Galactic "Deal" was posted in UFO, promoting #Make_Antares_Green_Again?!?, giving the newbros grants/subsidies, to grow on one of those planets, and to also vote for the COGC?

@riseoffilth since you are gov of many ANT planets. What's your take on that? I think it would help a lot to new bros (like me when I had to relocate my starting base from phobos to heph)


[17-Aug-24 02:14 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I absolutely think Heph should be a starter planet over Phobos. 100%, no doubt.


[17-Aug-24 02:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
But additionally, (also @archielvahr ), I think Nascent would make a great starter planet


[17-Aug-24 02:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
if we were looking to expand starter planet candidates


[17-Aug-24 02:15 PM] riseoffilth#0000
a dedicated RES planet thats 3x green? Huge for anyone making C


[17-Aug-24 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah Nascent would be great. The only struggle there is that the starter packs want you to build farms and it's not fertile. Asking for a new starter pack ( aka profession ) is probably too big an ask


[17-Aug-24 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
ALO extraction on Nascent is pretty good too for noobs

[17-Aug-24 03:01 PM] tanda#0000
that would be the only starter planet to immediately require shipping, though?


[17-Aug-24 03:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
ALO and C prices support it, they got 2 ships for a reason üòÑ


[17-Aug-24 03:05 PM] tanda#0000
definitely not a 3 star starter planet then


[17-Aug-24 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's gotta work with the starter packs to really work, you've got to assume the noob is _only_ reading the in-game tutorial. So while Nike would be great, they won't have SEA. I am pretty sure the "Carbon Farmer" pack asks you to build a farm, so it requires a fertile planet.


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] riseoffilth#0000
is there no extractor start pack?


[17-Aug-24 03:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nope

[17-Aug-24 03:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think the devs incorporated high attrition rates for new players, when they're trying out the game, especially when they have no exposure to Prun's genre. Potentially low retention rates, very niche interactivity, and a very high learning curve. It's probably why the starter packs are so flaccid, and don't really impact market volumes, until that newbro decides to stick with the game, and expand.

So I think it's very unlikely that we'll see changes to the starter packs/planets any time soon.

However it's not stopping anyone from offering more possibility to new bros, if they meet like some basic requirements (like having PRO), as in offering second starter-paks, to say C-farmers who started out on Harmonia.

**So a Nascent C-farmer, but no fertility?** Well you can still grow HCP on Nascent, and burn the C, however you just gotta compromise on some things. Trigger warning? (this one will probably make some people mad, LOL).

They likely will, but seeing though as everything in-prun-space, is a 3d projection, based off-of coordinates, that we will never know, it'll be hard to guess approximate values for those.


[17-Aug-24 08:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But, I'd wager that the devs would incorporate some sort of exponential cost, for using the gateways:
* 1) Planetary gov contracts some corp to construct the gateway in orbit
* 2) Contracted corp points the gateway to some target (exponential costs with increased target distance, from origin?)
* 3) Contract corp funds maintenance fuel/repair costs for the gateway, and charges fees per instance of use
* 4) There will be a utility curve, expressed mechanically (which we will likely never figure out); most contracted operators will likely figure things out after 1-3 months of intense operation.

Yes, but the devs might apply magnitudes of cost.


[17-Aug-24 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
They said the linking radius is in parsecs, we don't know the ranges though, so it's still speculation


[17-Aug-24 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nah, this tool is at https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/map/

Parsec is a range, btw.


[17-Aug-24 08:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you click "pathfinding" and two systems, it will tell you the number of parsecs between them

Let me pop another beer, before I type some "prudent recommendations" in terms of cost efficiencies, strategically (just my thoughts).

like 16 jumps over 20 parsecs is fairly common, but a lot of those are from one arm of the galaxy to another, so not a lot of action out there

[17-Aug-24 09:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This might eventually involve several things. If those gateways would require some sort of jump-fuel, for operation, you might eventually see STLs hauling around FF tanks, or FTLs donating fuel, if ever these gateways become more time-efficient than manual jumps. We'll find these things out when the release notes get published, however my focus on this is on the strategic aspect.

* 1) My initial guestimate --- 1 gateway per planet, initially.
* 2) This limitation confers a means of limiting activity, which the devs apparently like to impose
* 3) Recommendations of COGC Activity + STL inclusion in these things


* ANT CX (Hephaestus) ---> Deimos ---> Nike ---> Hephaestus
*Bober --> Nascent --> Vulcan --> Bober
* Linking related COGC chains, in one-way routings.... You guys will have to decide how it'll look like though


[17-Aug-24 09:12 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Each CX, has a # of planets, which will require an ADM (1+mil of capital donation, if not evident at release, per ADM at a CX-system planet), which will provide for a centrally distributed gateway network. Each path could provide service for a particular industry-to-industry production chain. 

Not only do you need the ADMs, + Gateways, you also need someone running stuff on those planets to provide GOV/PM voting ability to said gateway projects. 

I'll say that it's best to organize now, since per the dev log notes, it looks like this sort of thing is what we'll be dealing with, at least initially.


[17-Aug-24 09:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
East Antares will need a dev-installed CX though. You can max out West Antares routings through the few planets within ZV-307's system, as-is. Without another CX, you'll be cutting off the outer-rim extraction possibilities (if there is any), out there from ANT.


[17-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000

[17-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000

17 ENGs per term is the natural rate. FEST III is propping the average figure up, artificially.

Import OFF, apply to INF; set INF to level 3 --- that planet has a tierable POPR, which is much, much easier to deal with, than a PIO heavy POPR.

Apparently.... Most of those tiered pop needs should be covered by the Life support (bases) + Satefy (SSTs). It's only when you're counting up higher tiers, that Health and Comfort come into play. Comfort's already covered by current POPI uses, it's just the Health, which is used by TECs to foster growth, but also by ENGs to maintain happiness, and pull in TEC education, from marginally increased happiness #s.

But 20k AIC per week, for the INF lv 3(OFF) upkeeps, is not much compared to the 36k AIC per week (manually done btw) for the Festivities 3.

I'd recommend trying to maintain stable market supply, on the things that matter (ANT has ran out of a b-fab market, for quite the long time. SF/FF are pretty much next in line, with how things are going)... As to why.....

```
Note the money supply, and market maker balances. 5.003 bil in AIC supply.... -6.329 bil in AIC sinks.... [Most recent dev economic report]
```

The disparity is only increasing through time. Instead of being able to circulate currency between various industries of production, we'll dolling out heavy figures on basic MM provisions, and then have to rely on EDC/IDC farms to supplement market liquidity. I can't tell you why we're experiencing sky high prices atm... It's probably due to other factors.


[22-Aug-24 11:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
Influx of new bros? Plus people are switching to more advanced products with higher margins


[22-Aug-24 11:52 AM] marat_sh#0000
IDC shouldn‚Äôt be a thing in my opinion


[22-Aug-24 11:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It is, unfortunately. The advanced production that you mentioned, is driving IDC margins to be better than EDCs. A-fabs and MEA. :/


[22-Aug-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Where did you see 6.329 bil in AIC sinks? The sinks are reported as positive numbers, like the bfabs and consumables, which have only grown a few dozen mil during that month. The negative "Marketmaker balance total" reflects the money introduced from EDC/IDC sales. 

If you look at the Money Supply, you can see the Last AIC is 4.59b compared to the min of 4.25b, so the money supply of AIC increased 340m. 

The marketmaker balance total went from -5,148m to -5,557m, so 409m new AIC was introduced from market makers.

The difference from money supply to market maker balance means (409-340 = 69m) 69m AIC was removed from circulation via non marketmaker means (aka quitting players or maybe the APEX center). 

When a big player quits like Churv you can usually see the bump down in money supply. Somone with NCC and other currencies had their account deleted 5/30, you can see a bump there:

Most of EV1L burned out after their huge Arclight project at the start of the year. xelsored lasted longer than most, but he was basically the last. And supporting dozens of bases out in Arclight mostly by himself. I'm astonished he lasted as long as he did.


[22-Aug-24 07:59 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but yeah, most of his wealth was moved internally within EV1L and other partner corps off of CX, but he was likely one of the wealthiest players in the game. He shared a lot with KAWA and it was... insane. He *easily* had more wealth than our whole corp combined many times over...

I've said it in other places and I'll say here again. A certain level of warehouse is understandable. But I saw a gov request 900k for a warehouse upgrade on a planet where that is several months worht of income, and I voted no to reimburse. That isnt a smart financial decision and 4 warehouses is incredibly niche and only serves very few


[24-Aug-24 05:09 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It doesnt even affect production or efficiency. Its just min-maxing extra space.

Antares Planetary Upgrade Fund

As a result of a public poll on Phobos, after significant discussions with the MPs, we've decided to open up the excess funds generated each month, about 10mil, to the rest of Antares govs and mps, to support new/small planet growth, as well as planets of vital industry. Specifically around POPI infrastructure and new planet ADM/COGC upgrades.

DM me directly your proposal and I will present it to the other MPs for consideration.


[24-Aug-24 05:16 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I do not challenge its niche utility. I challenge its return on investment and value to the average member of a planet, and whether it is worth the significant cost from the limited wallet of a planet.

[24-Aug-24 05:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmmm. Well I can't type out the WAR material costs, per level...(FIO spreadsheet idea -- since Prunplanner doesn't incorporate GOV infrastructure costs?) However I would like to point out, that it depends on the planet, and the particular nature of the cost sinks. An immediate +X WAR upgrade, which wasn't needed, nor is funded for by projected governmental revenues? --- I'd definitely take a hard look at it. 

It also depends on what's being done at that given planet, or around it. Huge extraction/farming operations? Maybe. Construction? Probably not.


[24-Aug-24 05:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And yes, I mean take really hard look at it. 

What would be the typical base, that would be disposed at such a planet.. 

Would they be losing much, if any, marginal revenues, should they incorporate STOs into their build? 

IF not, what should the GOV charge, for long-term use of public warehousing, per week? 

Is the planet + COGC strategically beneficial to the region? 

And so on....


[24-Aug-24 06:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But, I have two suggestions..... 

* 1) Update Archiel's Good Governance Gimmick (I'm just having fun), to include say, POPI upkeep + POPI upgrades + the random PPS (planetary project stuff), so that anyone, anywhere, could do a simple lookup of what liquidity they will be sinking into whatever, not just on a immediate basis, but on a long-term basis. ---- With just the GOV sheet, and looking through everyone else's upkeeps, I'm having a really hard time trying to "guess", if everyone in-game, understands the opportunity-cost realities....


[24-Aug-24 06:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
#1's a big ask, I know....

* 2) Aww dang, I might have lost my train of throught....  Ah, I got it... From whatever public surveys I've seen, there's basically a very small, and very vocal, minority, that is voicing their opinion, on a given planetary site. Out of some hundreds of planetary plots anywhere, there's basically 5-15% of people, who actually commit their opinions, to action, be it on GOV, third-party surveys, or in actual voting.... 

You're just skimming the surface of the actual operational reality of any given planet. If you want to know the actual details, what's the player spread on the planet? Pure COMG-specfic bases? Hybrid bases? Nonchalant whatever tf people want bases? Special interest bases? Decoupled/inactive bases? These details will confer with point #1, on what's actually needed, and it's incredibly hard to get, since people basically don't talk. :/ My opinion, from what I've seen.


[24-Aug-24 06:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Without the data, you're basically just guessing, and I'd think that playing guessing games with whomever, is not the best idea.


[03-Sep-24 05:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
@riseoffilth Hi üëã Sorry for bringing up the warehouse upgrades discussion, but what do you think about getting some funds for upgrading warehouses in ANT space for Resource Extraction COGC planets to lvl 3(1000/1000)? it's not as extreme as lvl 7 (2000/2000). I think it would help everyone getting resources off the planets instead of putting all of the hard work on people who do extraction

[03-Sep-24 05:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
Let me know what you think


[03-Sep-24 09:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I personally think such things should be funded by the people who are directly to benefit from it, which tend to be the minority. But if you have a specific planet and idea in mind, send it to me and ill present it to the parliament.


[03-Sep-24 09:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
I looked deeper into it and it looks like most of them that makes sense already over lvl 3. I forgot to update my message üòÖ For future settled planets in faction space could be useful


[03-Sep-24 09:47 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Id be supportive of like, getting access to like 2-3 warehouses, depending on what is the limiting factor, volume or mass, for RES planets


[03-Sep-24 09:47 PM] riseoffilth#0000
because those are cheaper, and you can set half contracts


[03-Sep-24 09:47 PM] riseoffilth#0000
so its just 2 contracts for full up ship sizes


[03-Sep-24 09:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but to max it out for like 6 warehouses per... i dont think thats a good investment... But I'll bring it to Phobos Parliament either way


[03-Sep-24 09:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
if they support it,it gets funding


[03-Sep-24 09:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
after lvl 3 it should be a planet investment but up to lvl 3 it's not that bad


[03-Sep-24 09:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
1000/1000 is already 2 starting ships


[03-Sep-24 09:49 PM] tanda#0000
On that note, SE-110a and b could really use a bit of an up. They're single warehouse only locations. Makes moving in a hassle, that's for sure

[04-Sep-24 10:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
I picked up a shipload of argon recently from some random planet, on the way up I upgraded the warehouse just because it made that one contract easier to deal with


[04-Sep-24 10:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
And warehouses never go bad


[04-Sep-24 10:28 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, well I get that WARs are a niche thing, but I'd like to point out that POPI/PPS upgrades, are usually a long-term thing, unless you've been situated on a planet, long-term, without any noticeable infrastructure upgrades.


[04-Sep-24 10:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or should a given planet be experiencing a significant, short-term player influx, that will be unmet with current infrastructure.


[04-Sep-24 10:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
WARs are also entirely optional, however there may be a few instances wherein, a given place would really "need" to have WARs, of any kind...


[04-Sep-24 10:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
I think POPI on newly settled planets should be on the people who settled there (since it benefits just them) WARs on the other hand help with logistical loads in the faction space


[04-Sep-24 10:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Of course, people have Archiel's gov sheet, and gov guide. I'd add, if you're dealing with PIOs (you don't really need anything); with SETs, you need SSTs; with TECs, you need INFs; with ENGs, you need PARs. And everything else is just more expensive.


[04-Sep-24 10:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
I can argue that newly settled planets should be getting funds on vote bases (see if people are interested in supporting specific planet)


[04-Sep-24 10:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I usually incorporate x2 STOs, if not three of them, on any given base.


[04-Sep-24 10:34 AM] marat_sh#0000
well it's you


[04-Sep-24 10:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[04-Sep-24 10:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Others? Not so much.


[04-Sep-24 10:35 AM] marat_sh#0000
but if I need H but I don't want to drop a base so I can buy more then 500/500 H at the time from a planet who has a H base there


[04-Sep-24 10:36 AM] marat_sh#0000
STOs are good for people who can make deliveries themselves But not so much for people who want to buy a resource from that planet


[04-Sep-24 10:36 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Up to WAR level 12, should be easy enough to fund....


[04-Sep-24 10:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
that'll afford 3k t/m3 area.


[04-Sep-24 10:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
lvl 3 is already a huge boost


[04-Sep-24 10:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
LVL 7 is more on expancive side


[04-Sep-24 10:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
and it should be a planet investment at that point


[04-Sep-24 10:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's still not expensive, since you have a SUM[ Constant(Odd_level + Even_level)] material costs.... They start to add up after level 10, but another 2 levels can be justified. However, you'll either want to source some private funds (from those who will be directly benefiting from such additional space), or adjust the rental fees for those warehouses, to fund such expansions, in the long-term (1-2 years)?


[04-Sep-24 10:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
Using Phobos funds for funding up to lvl 3 and after that it should be on the planets income


[04-Sep-24 10:43 AM] marat_sh#0000
if place has a heavy traffic for argon/limestone/hydrogen and etc. It can be discussed with people of Phobos and voted on per planet


[04-Sep-24 10:43 AM] marat_sh#0000
if it's worth investing over lvl 3


[04-Sep-24 10:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
it will also help new players to go for extraction cogcs and not being afraid of 1000/1000+ daily shipping


[04-Sep-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You do understand, that's 3.5 LCB FTLs for that figure, right?


[04-Sep-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just for a single base/extraction point


[04-Sep-24 10:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yes and people can use LMs to sell on site instead of trying to ship it with starting ships


[04-Sep-24 10:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes.


[04-Sep-24 10:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's still a convoluted differential though. You can't demand given standards, yet you can't expect that no one will want upgrades, at least on the individual-operational side of things. I'd always suggest STOs, since well, they cost nothing, aside from potential daily extraction rates, but near-free storage is still near-free.


[04-Sep-24 10:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
On the STOs costing nothing --- I usually plan my bases with alloted shipping capacities, and spare base area, so for me, they cost nothing to plop down.


[04-Sep-24 10:49 AM] jcheung#0000
Too many STOs are pretty expensive opportunity cost wise


[04-Sep-24 10:49 AM] jcheung#0000
While too few are logistical headaches


[04-Sep-24 10:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
over 2STOs is already overkill


[04-Sep-24 10:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's "ideal" base ratios...


[04-Sep-24 10:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
I see what you are saying but I am in perspective of a buyer when I don't have a base there and I can't buy that much from person if warehouse is not sufficiently upgraded

üëç 

[04-Sep-24 10:51 AM] laaxus#0000
for me, I fit as many building as I can, and then put a STO if possible


[04-Sep-24 10:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I do farming + fps. Let say on a HYF planet, any one, since you can plop HYFs anywhere. I can drop 20 HYFs, + habs + x3 STOs, with 2 base area left over.


[04-Sep-24 10:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If i drop only 1 STO, maybe I can drop another HYF, but now I'm having to maintain excess HAB area, that will always go unused.


[04-Sep-24 10:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
... yeah I can't even do that.


[04-Sep-24 10:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
unless I drop another permit (1 permit only, via the example).


[04-Sep-24 10:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
that's what I do, unless I deem that I need more STO, for whatever reason.

I go for at least 1 STO if my daily shipping is over 250/250 üòÖ


[04-Sep-24 10:55 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
lv 12 WAR, for a 3k/t shipment weekly.. lv 10 WAR for a 2k/t shipment weekly... You could buy more, and be able to purchase more, however the ratios are limited, and you'll be doing daily micromanagement with them.

They could be, if you have a base there.

There's a contractual fulfilment preference. Base first, then WAR.

I'm talking of fulfilment, via contracts. You can fiddle with the stuff after its been delivered, though.

Etherwind has the biggest POPI levels in Benten from FIOC maxing out almost everything, the others are catching up. Katoa only has lvl 4 INF, lol


[04-Sep-24 12:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It does, well that sucks. Maybe they should have kept with a REF COGC some 2+ years ago, and they would have had that stuff maxed out by now. :/


[04-Sep-24 12:30 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
eh, the bonus benefits manufacturing more than refining by a lot, but honestly I'd be ok with the flip... The reason INF is 4 is because it's not even needed right now

Experienced governors: We're looking at dropping 3 bases in the near future on YK-266c to work on REA supply. The infrastructure is pretty barebones with only a single unstocked SST.
My current plans are to prioritize building both a COGC and an INF on the planet, and stock the SST with DW and OFF. 
I will need to grow 2k PIO and 1.2k SET. What is the most efficient way to make this happen?


[11-Sep-24 11:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
First off, for 2k pio and 1.2k set, there is absolutely no need to have more than a single input on the SST. you are just throwing away money.

Just an SST with OFF is sufficient.

But you will want to build a COGC, ADM, and SST. Run and elect yourself in the 3 day election, and then run programs to get the population you need. 2x PIO and then 4-5 SET programs will get you your numbers


[11-Sep-24 11:42 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If you would like to petition the wise and magnanimous MPs of Phobos for funding, I can certainly drop such a request in that channel

Can you list the 3 planets you are upgrading, along with their planned respective COGCs?


[12-Sep-24 05:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Also, an existing planet, KI-840c, is already a strong contender for BRM production, which leads to REA. Why not use that?


[12-Sep-24 06:11 PM] getonthetrain#0000
YK-266c provides 2 more BRM per cycle, or is 13% more efficient then KI-840c. As a pure REA base, it would be more profitable. each BRM feeder base - when maxed out - would produce 77 more BRM per day. Over the course of a year, that means 28,105 more BRM from EACH feeder base. Translating that into REA, each base would provide 11,242 more REA each year - or 22,484 total.


[12-Sep-24 06:13 PM] getonthetrain#0000
22,484 at 500/u REA is 11,242,000 AIC annual, or nearly 1 million more per month. In addition, it is only 4 shorter jumps to ANT compared to 5 longer jumps to KI-840c.


[12-Sep-24 06:58 PM] tanda#0000
The only planet in question for development is YK-266c. My current plan is to run Chemistry COGC.
I'm not going to pretend I saw KI-840c, but it is not just poorer in output, it's also situated another jump away from the CX. I also believe we could do with another (yes, another) chem planet near into Antares.


[12-Sep-24 06:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
One further benefit is that YK is closer to all markets, should we need to sell this bountiful production elsewhere.

lowstrife's Festivities III argument?!?


[18-Sep-24 12:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Is it worthwhile to consider? Will it save money for the GOVs in the long run, or is it just some ploy?


[18-Sep-24 12:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
He's literally spamming it all over the verse... Hard to avoid, since he's kinda everywhere.


[18-Sep-24 12:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Although, the DW/COF/KOM/ALE+ markets will be freaking out in a week or so.... It's not hard to guess the incentive of the rhetoric.


[18-Sep-24 01:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
The math is generally sound


[18-Sep-24 01:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'll tend to agree, without digging into specific, before tomorrow.


[18-Sep-24 01:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If the devs ever introduced a weight argument into Festivities... then that would change things.


[18-Sep-24 01:55 PM] riseoffilth#0000
The math works, but I generally consider the reliance on programs and the lack of flexibility to do other programs when needed is irresponsible and generally a worse option, even if slightly cheaper for station-keeping pop levels.


[18-Sep-24 02:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's some angle to it... Our boy wouldn't be posting over every COMG that they've a presence on, without it. It's just uncommon sense, to do all that work, when most GOVs/PMs, have already dug into those metric, on face value....


[18-Sep-24 04:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah this is the main reason I haven't looked into it much. Like, if I balance my upkeep around needing Fest3 every week, but then there's a base build and I need to run an immigration program... doesn everything just suffer until I've build up that one pop? It feels like you lose a lot of flexibility relying on programs constantly, so the savings would have to be huge


[18-Sep-24 06:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Yes. The whole downside is it locks you out of the entire "program" ecology. You just dont get to use it without instantly succumbing to low happiness everywhere.


[18-Sep-24 06:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
because it suppresses TRUE happiness


[18-Sep-24 06:54 PM] riseoffilth#0000
because FES happiness is an additive on top


[18-Sep-24 07:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
How long is true happiness averaged over? Could you switch programs and only fill POPI for that week?

[24-Sep-24 09:41 AM] riseoffilth#0000
depends, do you want a COGC and ADM? If so, 2.5mil+. after that, the programs to get 1k pios is like... 15k per program, and you need 2?

I see thanks


[24-Sep-24 09:47 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Honestly though I doubt you'd need the program, pios fill pretty fast. You could probably get away with just building the CoGC at first and wait for the pop to fill. Especially with BWS prices right now

The programs are super cheap and fast for PIO and SETs. The ADMs are mostly just lfabs, I dunno the CX price but my internal prices come up at 574k for the ADM


[24-Sep-24 10:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
And there's other reasons to have an ADM so I guess I just take that as a given


[24-Sep-24 11:33 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
üòÜ no I definitely think an ADM is the way to go, it's just a long time to break even and most pioneer only bases aren't making insane amounts of cash. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø idk, still probably worth ADM by a lot, but BWS is high right now so depends on the plans imo

Same. Paris has been a fine gov for Deimos, and the existing parliament team has been supportive. Rotary is not rerunning, so I would suggest voting for Mysterious Walrus as a new candidates who is not among the existing cohort.

The lineup should be on Deimos:

-Paris
-Rise
-Capi
-Tanda
-MysteriousWalrus

``` A smaller planet will only have a parliament size of one, planets with more than 25 bases will have a parliament of three and for very large planets the parliament will have five members. We deliberately start with small parliament sizes and depending on how well the feature works might increase this in the future.```

I've recently taken an interest in planetary governance. Thanks for the awesome write up and google sheet Archiel.

Perhaps I'm miss-reading it or just not noticing where it's addressed, but is there any consideration given to the cost of capital?

For example - Looking at Safety - It seems clear that building SST's and feeding them with OFF is the most cost effective way of providing Safety. But surely there's a tradeoff at some point between cost of capital vs cost of upkeep? At some point, wouldn't it be better to supply Safety stations with 2 or even 3 of the inputs, rather than building 2 or 3 times the number of safety stations to provide the same amount of Safety?


[28-Oct-24 06:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
For sure, I think most govs tend to think longer term though and try to set up planets to be efficient without as much consideration for how long it takes to pay off those upgrade investments. For a lot of govs it's also a matter of what materials are accessible, not just what's cheapest. That said, wouldn't be too hard to add upgrade costs to the sheet and see that info visualized somewhere.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[28-Oct-24 06:37 AM] evov#0000
As I set up my own sheets for governance, I think I'll include a cost of capital - something similar to the current rates people give loans out for ( maybe 0.3% per Day ) - and try to include that somehow when working out what the best methods of need fulfilment are.  Not sure how I'll do it yet, but, wanted to check to see it wasn't already done / allowed for elsewhere first.


[28-Oct-24 11:08 AM] kynadre#0000
So, doing the math on the cost per month of the additional consumables, compared to the one-time cost of an upgrade, will likely bear fruit. I may have incorrectly done math looking at the SUN, but it appeared to be much, much cheaper than adding DW. 

At some point, the population growth of the planet essentially forces you to choose between paying more for more consumables, doing a 1-time upgrade to an existing building, or adding one of the next tier up of quality of the same building type + its consumables

the important note for SUN calculations is that it is consumed once every 10 days, not every 3

I speak from analysis from the outside, not from experience, bear in mind!


[28-Oct-24 11:10 AM] kynadre#0000
There's also the fiddly note that a high number of low population bases naturally boosts security up due to base #, whereas a few bases with high population require more security


[28-Oct-24 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Having up front capital costs would be great. I think mostly the capital costs get ignored because planets last forever, and the POPI buildings never degrade. But on the other hand, the ACA has cheap supply but is a very expensive building, and people generally ignore that building. I like it cause it uses DW


[28-Oct-24 11:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd like to think that people tend to nit-pick certain PPU evaluations, when dealing with POPI upkeep, if not other things... 

But cost-effectiveness results from your income, or what you get from taxes, to purchase/reimburse mats on the CX, or furnish whatever you make --- **to support what you need**. Most of that is usually GOV discretion.

(IF I'm making thousands of TUBs per day, cost effectively, and they don't really sell on the CX, due to price margins... I'm going to drop some TUB on my planets, if they need it, as compared to other options, no? - example). The money circulates around people, so it's not really an issue IMO, unlike APEX contributions.


[29-Oct-24 12:00 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But CptColeslaw and Kynadre are on point. There's other maths stuff that you can look into via https://pct.fnar.net . But most higher pop worlds don't have the luxury of picking and choosing, since they've got PIO/SET populations which eat up most of the upkeep, and if they choose to build up TEC/ENG/SCI populations, that's just another concern.

[29-Oct-24 01:17 AM] evov#0000
The way I look at things... is that capital has value. If a planet has 1mil in funds... I could spend it on adding another level to the building and keep using the cheapest input. OR, I could loan it out (or otherwise use it productively) to generate $... at 0.3% per day - that's 3000 per day.

I very very strongly suspect that there would be a point where the value of the capital far exceeds the price difference between the cheapest and the 2nd cheapest fulfilment option.

I think the same is broadly true for building the "large" version or the "mixed" versions of the pop upkeep buildings. Initially they don't make a lot of sense, but as those 20% cost increase per level starts to build up, I think some of those large/mixed options start to look more appealing by comparison.

(For context, I've recently founded 5 planets with support up to engineers.. maybe some sci later, and have rough plans for another 4 or 5 to come. So the Governing side of the game is something I haven't spent any time looking at until now, but I intend to go pretty deep into the weeds and figure it out)


[29-Oct-24 01:43 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There are such points... But it's a "needs" based thing... 

"Omg... GOV, why are our POPR metrics dropping too low? This is unacceptable!" (what you will likely hear in your planet COMGs, given + 2 weeks after current metrics drop below upkeep rates, evidenced in Archi's Gov sheet).

And basically no one will tell you what they're doing/wanting-to-do on your planet(s). :/


[29-Oct-24 01:52 AM] evov#0000
My planets are intended to be invite only. So... yes, people do tell me what they're planning to do before they put a base down. As a result, I can sometimes que up the Immigration program they need before they get there.

Wondering if anyone has much experience doing partial fulfilment on lower pop planets? With low pop planets, I find the fulfilment produced far exceeds the needs required in a lot of cases.


[18-Nov-24 07:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I partially filled POPI sometimes when new bases were built on my smaller planets. I'd use WH to fill 1 week of materials instead of the full month


[18-Nov-24 07:25 PM] evov#0000
That'll still use the full week of consumables and produce the full amount of needs though right?


[18-Nov-24 07:28 PM] evov#0000
Example - Build an SST, feed it with all the OFF it can handle = 833.3 Safety Fulfilment produced.
What if I don't need 833.3 Safety, I only need... 100 Safety?

I would think... doing something like this would produce half the amount of safety / use half the amount of resources. With the obvious downside of increased micromanagement.

[18-Nov-24 07:58 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but for more expensive stuff I've always been curious. Like when Katoa was so big that it needed all 3 mats in SST, I think I could have partially filled SUN every week instead of completely filling it. Population dropped before I had a chance to experiment though


[18-Nov-24 08:02 PM] evov#0000
Yea, I think it's only really an issue for smaller planets. But, as a guide using "partial" fulfilment on some of these places I started takes the weekly input bill from 60k down to 8k. Extra work, and if it was just MY money probably wouldn't care. But when the goal of these planets are to be self sufficient, AND generate enough extra tax revenue to help pay for gateways... it's more important to look for the best solution and be a better steward of Gov funds.


[18-Nov-24 08:04 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fair, good point


[18-Nov-24 08:05 PM] evov#0000

[18-Nov-24 08:29 PM] evov#0000
They could be. I think the issue is that the pop input cycles are every (in this case) 3 days. But the pop report is every 7 days. So I'm guessing things can get messy pretty quickly.


[19-Nov-24 05:08 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The harmonics do get messy. I've looked into this on the side. Haven't tried it out due to micromanagement concerns. But CptColeslaw's "compartment" contribution tip basically solves the concerns that I had from a user standpoint. 

So from your example, a continuous SST | OFF gets you 833 + 1/3 Safety per week. Just cut up the period contribution by a ratio of 1/8, and you'll be getting the ~104.2 safety, on a contribution of ~4 OFF every 3 days, that you need for POPRs.

[19-Nov-24 05:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can even use unemployment as a resource. Buffer out POPR surpluses by simply not contributing to POPI infrastructure, but there's issues with that - the same issues when a planetary GOV is trying to increase higher tier happiness metrics via POPI, on a decently settled planet: 

the lower tiers will eat up any additional Comfort, Culture, and Education bonuses that you put in.

You'll get a spreadsheet tool from me on these concerns - I just need to make some time to format it.


[19-Nov-24 05:20 AM] evov#0000
I've got my own sheets work out what sort of partial fulfilments I want. Moreso just wanted to see if other people had done this and what their experience was. It "feels" like the sort of thing where I need to manually drip feed the mats in every day or two in order to make it work.

[19-Nov-24 05:21 AM] evov#0000
The other more public governance tools I've seen usually just have the inputs as a check box... so not really set up to manage partial fulfilments from what I could tell.


[19-Nov-24 05:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah it's not setup for that. It assumes POPI satisfaction levels off whole numbers, with continuous upkeep. I'm pretty sure it's meant to be a mass-release tool, and adding in more niche "methods" can confuse people, who haven't looked into particular POPR/POPI mechanics.

Micromanagement as a hidden negative feedback "cost" for people trying to game the system? I've pondered this, however you will probably never get a confirmation from any dev of such intentions. This also runs into ship/base overall #s for players, but that's a convo for some other channel.

Question about Need Fulfillment - Where does the "Life support" need fulfillment come from?

I've looked at all the Gov resources I can find and have no idea how to increase it (other than fertile planets always have 100% Life Support). And I feel like life support is potentially a limiting factor here

Bases or the fertility of the planet itself


[21-Nov-24 03:47 AM] evov#0000
So low number of bases vs high population is the likely cause?   ( High unemployment being an example of this ) And there's no real way to boost this need fulfilment other than just... more bases / lower overall pop ?


[21-Nov-24 04:02 AM] tanda#0000
I believe so. First time I've seen life support below 100, so you must really be pumping population


[21-Nov-24 04:35 AM] evov#0000
Yea, that's the goal. Aiming for population growth and - just starting to open the planets up for more people to join, so want to try minimize the time it takes for new bases to get the pop they need. (which is always a bit of a hurdle on smaller/newer planets)


[21-Nov-24 04:36 AM] evov#0000
The planet in question is an electronics planet- So virtually no need for Pioneers. Which I think is a big part of the life support issues.

[21-Nov-24 05:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd completely disregard that "Need Fulfilment" section on the POPRs. 

Each base plot (not permit!) grants 1,000 units of Life Support, for however long that players retains a base there. 

Most base permutations (of any COGC type) are underwhelming with need requirements, unless you run a rather small building, which you can plop dozens of units on the same base (my bases on Boucher need 990 PIOs... 99% utilisation of Life Support, if the planet were not fertile....; Epicier needs 1100 PIOs... a triple permit on Avalon with FPs and whatnot needs 2600 PIOs). You should not run into any problems with LS, just focus on the fundamentals.      [Your current LS requirements on IA-151b is 532/2000?)

Yes. I'd disregard it completely.. 

Because the superior portion of the POPR report was reversed-engineered a long time ago..... And I don't think anyone would care to do the same for the dev-implemented "need fulfilment" section, simply because: 
1) we have our own tools to give us better information; 
2) we don't know how the dev Need Fulfilment works; and 
3) it won't give actionable information.

Do note on IA-151b's POPR --> Need fulfilment section on the Culture percentage, then hop over to the POPI | ART corollary... There were no upkeep contributions there, since it was constructed, yet that section shows that those needs are being fulfilled. Unless there's something that I don't know, and can't gleam from the in-game buffers.

"Each base plot (not permit!) grants 1,000 units of Life Support,"   - Thanks. This is new info to me.

The planet is 51 days old now. The ART was being supplied, but I've stopped providing upkeep to it for the moment. This won't be reflected until the next pop cycle. Just a symptom of - Build it, stock it, get the ball rolling and THEN figure out the details and build the tools needed to optimize it.


[22-Nov-24 06:16 PM] evov#0000
@scintillating_iridescence  Do you have a link to where you're getting the info about 1000 life support per base plot? The numbers just don't line up if that's the only factor. To get the level of life support % I'm seeing, it would be more like 225 per base plot. So I'm guessing there's other factors at play.

I believe all we know is "On unhabitable planets, it has to be provided by habitation buildings. "


[22-Nov-24 11:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have considered building extra hab buildings just to try to fix it on certain small planets


[22-Nov-24 11:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have had life support shortages similar to what you have there. They tend to go away when you get more people.


[22-Nov-24 11:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
We know PIOs eat up a ton of life support, so as they leave it'll should hopefully improve. Your unemployment isn't crazy though, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[22-Nov-24 11:35 PM] evov#0000
Ok sweet. So the realistic situation is - no-one really knows where life support comes from (other than fertile planets) - only that it tends to not be an issue over time. Coming from hab buildings makes sense since it's a fairly high rate of unemployment there at the moment I think.

If you know the life support number you have, I would be interested in your hab count

I guess there's two people on that planet with 100% and 98% of area used


[23-Nov-24 12:20 AM] evov#0000
Total Habs on planet across 2 bases 

2x HBC
2x HB2
6x HB3


[23-Nov-24 07:04 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lolz. My best guess would be that each HBx building, provides a flat life support figure, per building tier.

So a HB1 could provide a flat 100 LS (supporting 200 PIOs, or a mix of others). A HB2 could provide a flat 65 LS... (I adjusted against PCT's POPI needs index, and my napkin math gets you to within 3% error of stated figures).

I also have no idea what the reporting periods on the POPRs are (concurrent or previous figures --- like the unemployment #s --- they're always stating last week's activity).


[23-Nov-24 07:12 AM] evov#0000
I could be wrong, but I believe a lot of the numbers (fulfillment for example) are all numbers at the end of the last report cycle. So probably need to subtract the population "change" listed to get a better idea of what they're looking at. i.e.   

235+55 Poi (290)
728 -241 Settlers (487)
1060 -76 Tech ( 984 )
8 +1 Engineers  ( 9 )

With Hab Capacity for - 
350 Settlers
750 Tech

I'd do it at mostly my #internal-offers prices for bfabs, so around 1.1m. I'm subsidising a bit a bit there compared to market, but don't mind. If you are willing to do 1m, then I'll cover any overage. *There's not really any buffer in the planetary funds, as I run the taxes relatively lean, so would contribute my bit personally.*

@finestone did it go awol? I coulda swore I checked every COGC before I left for holiday on Wednesday.


[04-Dec-24 03:42 AM] evov#0000
Small update on the fractional fulfilment trial I've been running on the planets I govern - I'm going to call it a success at this stage.

One big downside - Large increase in micromanagement. I kinda need to check every day ( or at least once every 3 days ) in order to partially re-fill each building, each upkeep cycle.

Upside - For newish low pop planets, I've cut the upkeep cost down to 20-30% of what it previously was. Which in most cases, can turn the balance sheet from net negative to net positive.

My goal ( at this stage) was to try to maintain about 70% need fulfilment across the relevant segments I was interested in. Ideally aiming for about 80-90% raw happiness on each worker tier and let the unemployment/open jobs number auto-regulate immigration.

Example - Fractional fulfilment - and the results after a couple of weeks.

Well all govs now have at least 1 deputy PM slot. You can always try to delegate some petty, and routine tasks, if they'd like to get a little bit more hands on. 

It'll also open room up for discussions once the numbers and formulae start to float around their brains.


[04-Dec-24 01:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
On larger planets, i tend to rebalance the POPI levels and put in a 2nd or 3rd input, if the prices are similar, to get what I need as a final fulfillment, rather than commit more effort. I can‚Äôt imagine enjoying or finding enough value in savings that overrides my evaluation of my time and attention.


[04-Dec-24 01:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
For level 1 stuff‚Ä¶. There definitely isn‚Äôt enough value to make micromanagement worth while to me


[04-Dec-24 02:03 PM] evov#0000
Yea, for me the value gained isn't worth the extra effort (maybe 20-50k per planet per week in savings ). But.... it's not MY money, it's the taxes of the members, and not being wasteful with it feels important.


[04-Dec-24 02:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm. It's a case-by-case thing, in my book. Some GOV/PMs in control of #special-projects might find partial upkeep useful, with their own willingness to implement them. Others will conform to a continuous upkeep model, with such consequences as required by POPR demands.

I'm taking a neutral stance. Hopefully my independent #sheet tools-will confer enough adequate, and actionable information, so that it'll be used side-by-side with Archiel's GOV sheet, in a split-pane, to cut down on micromanagement, and weekly/monthly user tasks.


[04-Dec-24 02:14 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Maybe the utility will garner more interest in GOV, so that reliable people can be taught the ways of empire, in full detail, so there will be less work for everyone on average...

Maybe the utility will garner more interest in actually producing some more niche upkeep items, at scale, pushing bids down to affordable costs... Who knows? I've just got limited time with it all, since I've got my fingers dipped in pretty much everything imaginable.


[04-Dec-24 02:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mo' engagement. Mo' interest. Mo' community. A better Prun in 1-2 years? I hope.

I'll run my calculations, independent of Evov's examples. When it's all done, maybe we can share some notes. Else I'll keep it on a competitive model, not out of personal interest, but for creative possibility. 

As an example... ~2.3 mil NCC monthly operational costs for COGC/POPI upkeep on Verdant, were entirely reduced to like ~ 850k NCC monthly costs, with subsequent tax reductions, on a public model, with TEC guarantees. :/

You mean this one? (It's floating around in here somewhere too).

It's still in alpha, but it 100% works. Right now, you just plugin whatever POPI/PPS upgrades you want, and it prints out all the material #s that you need, along with their manual/FIO cost estimates. 

It also computes in batch, so there's no need to calculate each level upgrade individually.

Oh, on another note.

For anyone interested, I'm not running for a seat on any planets that I do not actively manage the COGC for(for the mostpart). Just looking to reduce my footprint in the immediate, while in the long term, next few months, I'm probably significantly reducing my footprint in prun. I'll be around and doing plenty of stuff still, just trimming down on the excess and time consuming. Not sure exactly how that will play out. But if anyone is looking to getting into goving, there should be an wide spread of places that could use some folks helping keeping an eye on things.

[14-Feb-25 12:31 AM] evov#0000
My view is that Gov's should pay for whatever immigration programs are needed. Taxes are collected for a reason.


[14-Feb-25 03:37 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
If someone wants scientists that no one else needs though, I guess you could consider them paying for it as a special tax assessment.


[14-Feb-25 03:39 AM] flor2081#0000
true but usually taxes don't cover more than the population upkeep, like if you need to build another university or something, taxes aren't enough


[14-Feb-25 03:41 AM] flor2081#0000
I think that's the case anyways, not too sure üòÑ


[14-Feb-25 03:41 AM] evov#0000
If the tax rate is increased... it becomes enough I'd imagine.


[14-Feb-25 03:41 AM] flor2081#0000
but they're huge upfront costs


[14-Feb-25 03:42 AM] flor2081#0000
so you either need to raise taxes from the beginning, collecting way too much money just in case you ever need to upgrade


[14-Feb-25 03:42 AM] flor2081#0000
or the gov has to pay upfront from his own money and hope it'll be paid back some day


[14-Feb-25 03:47 AM] evov#0000
I do think that the prevailing view/culture on governance is that Gov's are somewhat expected to donate their time as well as capital. I don't agree with that. I think that planets should be self sufficient.... taxing enough to pay for upkeep + programs + pay back loans if needed for upgrades.

I think the prevailing culture around governance largely ignores the value of capital, and as a result fails to deploy it efficiently.


[14-Feb-25 04:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Does a planet has an own bank account?


[14-Feb-25 04:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Like government funds, where the production fees are collected?


[14-Feb-25 04:28 AM] realharvey#0000
yes this is the case


[14-Feb-25 04:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So, it‚Äôs basically two sides of the same coin - either you set the taxes low, cover only your expenses, and let people, who have special requirements, pay themself for that, or set the taxes higher, build up some cash reserves to fund programs, if needed. I feel there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do it, just two approaches with their own benefits and disadvantages - and something people can campaign and vote for

Honestly, how many people do you think check the tax rates of a planet before they build on it?


[14-Feb-25 05:10 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
This is how basically all of Benten (where SilentReaper operates) is governed and I think the reason he got kinda salty with Paris. Antares has mostly run with a "pay programs yourself" mindset because of Rise and some OOG govs


[14-Feb-25 05:11 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think it depends on planet size though. Some small planets literally can't pull enough taxes for programs


[14-Feb-25 05:12 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA governs a lot of planets and often use large planet income to pay for small planet upgrades/ programs


[14-Feb-25 05:13 AM] evov#0000
On the 9 planets I govern - Gov pays for everything. I fronted the cash to start the planets and started each of them with 1mil in the gov's bank. I pre-set the tax rates the same on all the planets, and the planets pay for all the things themselves. 

Then once a week I publish an overview of - upkeep costs / tax revenue / cash on hand for all of them.

Most of these planets have only myself on them, so I think they definitely qualify as "small"


[14-Feb-25 05:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I don‚Äôt. And as long as they aren‚Äôt ridiculous, I often don‚Äôt even include them in my calculations. üòÖ


[14-Feb-25 05:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Oh I personally fully agree with your philosophy in this debate, it's how KAWA is set up to govern, though our reporting is inconsistent after a lot of player turnover


[14-Feb-25 05:18 AM] evov#0000
I think the only thing that's hard to really... capture... is a good way to pay back the foundation cost of a planet. But the ongoing running costs - to me is a very clearly solved problem -  start with a small cash buffer ( 1mil is plenty ) - use taxes to cover all costs.


[14-Feb-25 05:26 AM] realharvey#0000
there are also some corgis on your planets recently :D


[14-Feb-25 05:29 AM] evov#0000
I just want to put some of the costs into perspective - 

I have a base on IA-158e -  Built to make WAI.
Roughly, if PrunPlanner is to be believed, makes 210k profit per day. 1.47mil per week.

Running cost for that planet / gov is about 20k per week. This covers upkeep for the CoGC and all 5 population tiers. And things tend to get more cost efficient with more people / higher pops.


[14-Feb-25 06:01 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
> or the gov[ernor] has to pay upfront from his own money and hope it'll be paid back some day

So, in the real world, governments pay for large up front costs with... bonds (which are then paid off by taxes)

But, unless I'm missing something, governments in prun can't take loans.  (At least not ones that would be attributed to the government, rather than the governor)

I tend to agree that taxes should cover everything including programs - at least, that‚Äôs how I run my planets. But on a lot of these larger planets, there‚Äôs tons of pressure to keep taxes low, and tax hikes can be a non-starter politically. I‚Äôve already seen plenty of tax arguments for pretty inconsequential hikes


[14-Feb-25 08:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
Especially because people will pull out comparisons to other planets with lower taxes (where they would have to fund their own programs etc)


[14-Feb-25 08:01 AM] sidepipe#0000

Tracks reimbursement price vs. CX price, supports multiple contributors, supports a ledger of unpaid contributions vs. payouts over time, and also can support a register of government storage, if you opt to organize it that way

üëç 

[17-Feb-25 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, originally there was a feeling that it was important that anyone could contribute materials to the planet and get reimbursed at the same rate. In those cases, I will hold the materials until I put them into the POPI. That way items wouldn‚Äôt get wasted.


[17-Feb-25 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
But very few people actually wanted to contribute in that way. And managing the storage was confusing for people who were auditing Malahat‚Äôs spending. So I have moved away from that storage tracking.


[17-Feb-25 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
But the system should theoretically work well for planets, where multiple members of Parliament are in charge of POPI


[17-Feb-25 12:18 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, the ledger section alone looks very solid


[17-Feb-25 03:13 PM] akyantor#0000
I started off using a ledger, but it was so infrequent that anyone else contributed and not convinced anyone actually looked at it for the smaller planets that I was looking after (Halyos / SE-648c). 

I now just refill the COGC/POPI once a week, paying out at CX average rate, with a single payout.


[17-Feb-25 03:13 PM] akyantor#0000
I suspect that may be less practical for a larger planet with more complicated upkeep


[17-Feb-25 03:19 PM] akyantor#0000
When I was tracking I used this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVnCuFO8aBOdb3cGuaKjSyYwItwcXLteuY-377Kw5B0/edit?gid=81970377#gid=81970377

[18-Feb-25 12:37 AM] evov#0000
Screen shot of the sheet/tool I made for myself to manage the planets I run. Not really a useful thing for other people to use, but if you're planning on making your own tools, it might help spark some idea's.

Main reason I made my own was I wanted to use fractional upkeeps to make the planets run as efficiently as possible, as far as I'm aware there wasn't really anyone else doing it, so it made sense to make my own sheet to manage it.

Respectfully: you make some sexy spreadsheets üòÜ how much of this is FIO pulls and how much is manual entry? KAWA uses a modified version of Archie's sheet, but I'd love to make something more efficient for running 20+ planets


[26-Feb-25 01:33 AM] evov#0000
Only external data that auto updates is prices.

Manual entry stuff I have to change/update = stuff in the peach colour.

Once a week I'll update Last period tax income, population count and cash on hand. - These numbers are linked to so I can provide a weekly update/report for everyone in the project to see how the planets are going.

Stuff in dark grey are raw numbers manually entered from external sources.
Stuff in green is typically derived values... stuff that gets calculated in the sheet.
Stuff in blue is typically output values... stuff that gets calculated AND the output is relevant / informs choices or actions.

I have one of these pages per planet I run ( at the moment 9, soon to be more than 9 I think ). The main reason I wanted to make my own was to allow me to manage fractional upkeep. I'm sure existing tools that are out there probably work fine for well established planets, but just didn't seem to work well for the things I was trying to optimize for.


[26-Feb-25 09:29 AM] jab.sh#0000
I think you can auto update cash on hand


[27-Feb-25 03:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah that's fair. Small planets can be weird to balance, especially for higher tier stuff, and it's easy to waste a lot of upkeep if you don't do it fractionally. For larger planets, you can kind of do the same thing, but on a larger scale. Just filling a week of upkeep every month or so and letting it settle back down


[27-Feb-25 08:35 PM] tanda#0000
Alright folks, I just inherited the Aceland governorship from xepiov by accident. I'm curious what more experienced governors would suggest here? It seems the planet is running a substantial unemployment buffer (maybe even excessive) on PIO and SET, but far into the negatives for ENG

All that info is in the top right of my screen shot. That's where I made the notes I used making the sheet. Small versions of the building are 2500. Large are 5000. Mixed are 1000/1000.  ( at least that what I understand it to be, so those are the numbers I used ). Everything else is just a fraction of that.... i.e. For a small building, 1 out of 3 inputs supplied, 50% of the time -> need fulfilment provided = 0.5 * 0.33 * 2500

Understood Pretty sure we did the same thing i just wanted a sheet were i could change the COG to the ever changing market

Any thoughts on when it's best to upgrade current infrastructure vs add a new Input?


[12-Mar-25 06:38 PM] tanda#0000
I'm currently looking at Aceland (again) and it looks like one of the two is on the immediate horizon. But after amortizing the infrastructure costs across 90 days +the increased cheaper inputs, it's still nearly 3x more expensive that adding 2 new inputs


[12-Mar-25 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think since infrastructure never needs repairs and it will outlast all of us, it makes sense to eat that sunk cost and take the savings over time. If you're a big player 90 day paybacks aren't uncommon (HQ upgrade costs).


[12-Mar-25 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Especially in situations where the capital is just sitting idle, like with the grant money Phobos distributes- if it's not spent, it's sitting idle


[12-Mar-25 10:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
And hopefully those infrastructure upgrades can turn into money in the hands of new players AND eventually have a return


[12-Mar-25 10:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Rise was always very aggressive upgrading to get the cheapest upkeep, and I think that worked well


[12-Mar-25 10:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Once you start looking at 90d to 180d+ returns.. the prices are gonna shift at that point anyway, so your returns might be better


[12-Mar-25 10:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
especially since some key gov upkeep items are MMs - like DW is going to be pegged. IDC will stay at the IDC rate forever. But secondary items like PFE or SUN will (I assume) rise in price


[12-Mar-25 10:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also if you do the upgrade later, then it's still a very long return , but you just start the clock later.


[12-Mar-25 10:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
That being said, if you are looking at 90d amortized construction still being 3x the price the second input. It's probably not worth it


[12-Mar-25 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Final consideration: If you're just 10% short on a need, building PAR number 8 will solve that, but doubling the number of mats in the 7 PARs will way overshoot. So that means partial upkeep or doing the upgrade. And partial upkeep is a lot to manage and error prone. A little inattention and you fall way short or overshoot.


[12-Mar-25 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I wouldn't ever begrudge the upgrade if it avoids the need for partial upkeep


[13-Mar-25 01:26 AM] evov#0000
As some of the planets I manage get closer to needing increased inputs, I'll be looking closer at this issue. Capital cost of upgrading buildings vs extra materials.

I think in general, the value of capital in this area is being under-rated. If the Gov has free cash sitting around... is it more effective to hand out loans and get interest on that $$ or spend it on upgrading pop inf to continue using the single cheapest input.

I very very strongly suspect that neither option will be the best choice in 100% of the situations.

I think it also depends on the building. Some buildings have clear secondary choices for inputs while others become very expensive.
