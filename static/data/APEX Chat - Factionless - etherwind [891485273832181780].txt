**neke86**:	We've only three days of OFF in the SST and I've no access to EPO to contribute again


[10-Oct-21 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	Perhaps a shipment from another CX would help. I need much bigger shipments to be able to go.

[10-Oct-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I've topped up the water for the SST.  Maybe we should go for a lvl 2 or 2 SST and just manage the upkeep with DW?


[10-Oct-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	1. will upgrading the SST alleviate the need for OFF?


[10-Oct-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	2. will the lack of one consumable lower or will it disable productivity of SST? Wiki says:"The CoGC’s programs require payment of an upkeep cost in the form of materials to go into effect."


[10-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	3. by building a second SST, do you mean another copy and is this possible; or do you mean another similar building with different consumables?


[10-Oct-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	given enough time, I can build OFF. still trying to figure out how much its worth it


[10-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Eliminating one consumable will reduce the effect, not eliminate


[10-Oct-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	More than one SST is possible, and the governor is able to select how many are active and consume resources at a given time. However, I believe each successive SST will require more resources to build.


[10-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	ok. good to know. if we know the factor of OFF, we can know its worth.


[10-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	It may be that the suggestion here is to build a second SST, and fill both with the non-OFF resources to double the effect of those resources, so that we may not need OFF.


[10-Oct-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trepach**:	do we know the factor of importance of OFF; to know if making OFF is better than doubling the rest?

[10-Oct-21 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	So far as I understand (and by the PCT research) all consumables do 1/3 of a SST worth of work.


[10-Oct-21 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	They also have the math on the price increase per level (but I can't recall)


[10-Oct-21 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	So a LVL 3 SST with just DW = LVL1 SST with all three


[11-Oct-21 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kubelo**:	cargo full


[20-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	New POPR is out - we have slid some in Safety and that could start to impact ability to grown and maintain our PIO pop base


[20-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I would like to suggest that we finance as a planet building an SST level 2 and supplying (at least for a couple weeks) the full OFF/SUN contribution.   I have priced out those elements at roughly CX prices and the total to upgrade the SST and supply those inputs is 106K CIS.


[20-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I have put out a suggestion on the UFO Discord in the #Etherwind General channel to determine if we have residents that would be willing to donate 10K CIS each towards that project and I will be happy to coordinate securing those b-fabs and supplies


[20-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	This is suggested in leiu of recommending that we try to bring up an ADM to have a formal governorship in charge of maintaining those planetary supports


[20-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If you want to join the discussion, show support, or pledge as a contributor, please join us on the UFO Discord - https://discord.gg/a7PzvUDB


[20-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I should also add, that if we upgrade to an SST2, then anticipate weekly input costs for upkeep will increase to almost 40K per week given the increased amounts used by the upgraded POPI building


[20-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	To that extent, I have also "resurrected" the ADM v no-ADM discussion for Etherwind in the UFO Discord

[22-Oct-21 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Water should be abundant, not sure about RAT? I bring mine from another abse


[22-Oct-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	we typically import RAT/CONS as well


[22-Oct-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@spentaneous - for your own base/production, the initial imports are likely to be focused around RAT and OVE/PWO for your pioneers to consume


[22-Oct-21 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	depending on how you decide to focus your base, you may desire to have some other inputs; but the general consensus for Etherwind is to focus on very basic production (H2O, DW, etc) here without as much advanced processing...at least based on what I have seen so far

[23-Oct-21 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Etherwind residents - I'm putting ads up for the donations towards building the SST2 - I will ad a few additional small supporter donation options if you were not able to commit through the Discord post to be a contributor!  All income from these contributiions will be used to secure the initial components for the SST#2, followed by securing SUN/OFF towards it's inputs, and then the remainder will be used to further secure/reimburse for CoGC inputs and DW for the SST

**Bugleberry**:	I would donate, but me being me I really don't have money for that

[23-Oct-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If you want a taxation free EW, you'll need to not vote for any corp members


[23-Oct-21 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	wait whats happening? if construction finishes on that project we are all getting taxed?


[23-Oct-21 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	His suggestion of completing the ADM. That building triggers governer and taxes


[23-Oct-21 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	One way to eventually force your hand is to get your used to the safety bonuses and say that instead of all this expensive stuff, just pay taxes


[23-Oct-21 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	There's a lot more to it obv.


[23-Oct-21 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	what do the taxes get used for. cause taxes arent always a bad thing


[24-Oct-21 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Are you contributing to the SST @Rwinner16 ?


[24-Oct-21 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's not exactly subterfuge


[24-Oct-21 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I want Safety Bonuses, in my experience, people do not contribute equally


[24-Oct-21 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And if you believe people should all chip in for the infrastructure, then do it fairly through taxation


[24-Oct-21 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you dont believe people should contribute fairly then...


[24-Oct-21 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Have you actually flooded the LM with useless noise in protest?


[24-Oct-21 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I would need to know what tangible gain is there in exchange for donating to anything


[24-Oct-21 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Since I really don't see any gain from it, since infrastructure that I have needs to be fixed by myself either


[24-Oct-21 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You're benefiting from lots of peoples donations already? there's an LM here you might use


[24-Oct-21 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	a COGC, affording you significant benefits to extraction


[24-Oct-21 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	a WAR


[24-Oct-21 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	As the planet grows, safety _will be needed_ to maintain the population


[24-Oct-21 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	it's not an opinion its just how the game works


[24-Oct-21 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This comes from funding and maintaining the SST


[24-Oct-21 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	To provide some numbers, Safety (which this SST will help maintain) goes down the higher the population of the planet is. There is a small increase based on the number of Core Modules (ie the number of distinct bases) but as bases get larger the safety requirements are no longer fulfilled by this.


[24-Oct-21 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Once safety starts going down (current safety figure is 60.3%) this impacts on happiness. If a population type is above 70% it grows, below 50% and it shrinks. Currently our Pioneers happiness is 73.8% so we are growing but it is borderline, the other population types are below 50% so are shrinking.


[24-Oct-21 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	For Pioneers there are only 3.9% (or 1,378) available for new work and there are currently 88 bases on Etherwind meaning 16 pioneers per base. If there are not enough spare pioneers to work at the building it runs at a reduced rate.


[24-Oct-21 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	All figures quoted are from the population report (New buffer and go to POPR KW-688c or click on the Workforce population button)


[24-Oct-21 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Put simply we need more population to fuel the buildings or expansion grinds to a halt and relying on donations alone will not be sufficient to maintain this in the long run.


[24-Oct-21 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	If there is sufficient people who want no taxes and rely on donations going forward they can vote for a candidate who stands on such a platform if an ADM is ever completed. Once elected they can set taxes to zero and we have no taxes for that cycle.


[24-Oct-21 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Just realised no-one directly answered the question 'What do the taxes get used for?'


[24-Oct-21 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	The taxes are used to purchase the materials used for the upkeep of the infrastructure.


[24-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	For example, the first level of Safety Station (SST) uses 50 Drinking Water, 30 Office supplies every 3 days and 30 Safety Uniforms every 10 days.


[24-Oct-21 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	When @neke86 ran the numbers it came out to 12.5k CIS per week to keep fully operational.


[24-Oct-21 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	It does provide benefits without being maintained fully however but at a lower level.


[24-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	On other planets if taxes provide a surplus this has been used to either build more infrastructure to keep the population growing and/or provide a tax cut.


[24-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	To clarify and supply some numbers: POPI buildings do not provide any 'needs' coverage passively - it is directly proportional to their upkeep.


[24-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	A fully supplied SST covers the Safety needs of 10,000 Pioneers, and so an SST supplied with just DW will only fully cover 3,333 Pioneers. This is compared to the 200 Pioneers passively provided for per player base on the planet. For reference, Settlers consume 20% more Safety than Pioneers, and Technicians consume 20% less.


[24-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	Currently, Etherwinds player bases cover ~45% of our total Safety needs, and it would take 2 fully supplied SSTs to reach 100% Safety coverage. That is not to say that we *need* 2 SSTs, but it is a balancing act to maintain sufficient needs and hence happiness for our current population and expansion rates.


[24-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	POPI and needs is a rather complicated topic, but suffice to say that POPI will be required to maintain any reasonable level of growth - particularly as the average base fills out with more buildings. This is a problem even for those who are no longer expanding, as the planets workforce is a common pool.


[24-Oct-21 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	thats all great informstion to know!


[24-Oct-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	if taxes are placed how are they calculsted. is it by the amout of time a structuer is working on things? or is it done by build order. and how much of an effect would this have on a new player that just started


[24-Oct-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	the fee is always related to 24h production time of a building


[24-Oct-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	if Tax is 15 per 24h and u produce 3 products with each 8h duration, u`ll pay 5 per product in tax


[24-Oct-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	Taxes come in 3 forms: production fees, LM fees, and Warehouse fees. @Alcohlol explains production fees ^, and they are usually quite negligible.


[24-Oct-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	thats possibly not so bad.


[24-Oct-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	The Governor has options to set taxes based on the industry - take a look at the buffer command `LR KW-688c`.


[24-Oct-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	im not at a point where i can help provide to make this building (having just started playing a couple days ago) but this doesnt seem too terrible at all. as long as whoever we vote in doesnt abuse it xD


[24-Oct-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That is the point Spent. There is nothing in place to prevent that. Look at Prox as a good example.

**neke86**:	I might post some BEN>EW shipping as well, see if it entices anyone


[24-Oct-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	Im headed BEN > EW in around 24 hours. Should have plenty of room to spare so I can grab whatever is up then


[24-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Looks like they've been taken now!


[24-Oct-21 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner16, you are exactly right in your statement that "there is a lot more too it obviously".  Having a planetary administration would be overall beneficial to Etherwind.  I wiil let others continue to make the argument for or against.


[24-Oct-21 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner16, I would like to request that you remove your LM clutter though.  If you are trying to bar progress towards an ADM, then please don't make it seem more necessary by inhibiting the ability to pursue purchases towards appropriate planetary support through the current donation and purchase solicitation process


[24-Oct-21 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I have bought only a single component of the inputs directly from my corp - the BSEs, because they were already on planet and available - but for the remainder, I have tried to set reasonably fair prices for those that did not have a direct offer from someone to contribute them at a specific price


[24-Oct-21 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	This effort has taken a much larger chunk of time than I anticipated (in both soliciting the funding and in trying to coordinate/set up the purchases).  If we continue to need to finance support for ongoing POPI and/or COGC inputs, I will use remaining balances from these donations towards that, but I will not personally coordinate another effort along these lines.  If you want to be ensured that someone will be taking responsibility for having those weekly inputs met, that should put you more in support of an ADM.


[24-Oct-21 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Finally, I agree with some of the other comments - what exactly do you feel is a problem with the Proxion management?  They have the most reliably fed POPI and are weeks (if not months) closer to having SCI pops compared to any other planet.  I for one am looking forward to the potential that this iteration of the PrUn galaxy will have more FTL and larger capacity FTL ships sooner....not of which would be possible without an engaged governor and now over 1 M in donations (not taxes) towards their more advanced POPI buildings

**Iamnopirate**:	what currency will we have


[25-Oct-21 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	i only have NCC and no pro account


[25-Oct-21 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Iamnopirate, if we do to towards an ADM, we will likely need to run it off of CIS.  If you have at least basic, there should be a way to work out some CIS for you to use for production fees (even it if is just to have you grab some upkeep contracts in CIS to supply DW periodically towards CoGC upkeep or SST consumables)


[25-Oct-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So here's an interesting question: If we build an ADM, the planet becomes affiliated with the faction of whomever wins the governorship, correct? If so, does that remove change the HQ bonus for anyone who has their HQ here?


[25-Oct-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	*typo*: remove the "remove" in the last sentence


[25-Oct-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@ryst - I don't believe so...for instance, Boucher has an ADM and has selected ICA as it's currency, but the planet itself (and therefore I would assume faction affiliated HQ bonuses) are still listed without an affinity


[25-Oct-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Since Etherwind does not have that faction affinity listed, we would not be bound by faction rules and would keep non-faction HQ status for production bonuses


[25-Oct-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Lastly, we would not be tied to faction required minimums for production fees, LM fees, and WAR fees.   I, personally, would not expect need to finance large scale POPI improvements towards TEC/ENG/SCI populations, so would envision quite low/minimal fees for most of those just to cover the weekly upkeep costs


[25-Oct-21 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Yes, I believe that only the default currency is used, not associated otherwise with a faction


[25-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	In that case, I'd personally rather have a governor take care of all of it than having to solicit donations all the time. JMO.


[25-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	im completely cool with taxes if it means the money is going towards the production of things on the planet that's beneficial for us


[25-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	cause a lot of that money will probably end up going back to the people of the planet who produce things needed to build things here anyways


[25-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	we all benefit in the end


[25-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Ryst and @spentaneous - well aid and much more succinct that I would have put it!


[25-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Oops - "said" not "aid"


[26-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner16 - Can I formally apologize here as well for the inappropriate assumption that your LM  posts were of an intentional nature to create diversion away from the visibility of the posts for the SST components and inputs.


[26-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'll apologise for that myself if it wasn't the case sorry

**Willger**:	Transport from Etherwind to Proxion, departure from now on in about 22 hours. 13 t / 125 m³ free. Flight time 2 days.

**Vedo22**:	Okay I need some help Im stuck on planet and I cant go to the comunity exchange. Since I ran out of FTL fule, what should I do


[26-Oct-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	Are you currently stuck on etherwind? Im sure someone could ship in fuel for you


[26-Oct-21 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vedo22**:	Ya I am. How do I ask someone to do that? Sorry im new


[26-Oct-21 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	Someone may see this chat and message you or just reply if they have some local to spare. You could also buy some at BEN and then post a shipping ad to Etherwind if you have Pro. People fly there pretty regularly so you would probably only be stuck for a couple days


[26-Oct-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vedo22**:	Ok thank you so much for your help :)


[26-Oct-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Iamnopirate**:	Why not go  towards NCC taxes?


[26-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	Why CIS? Because then Proxion gets our taxes to develop even more?


[26-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Iamnopirate I would consider the primary factor at the moment in the currency decision to be the current status of Etherwind as a starting planet and C-I faction for that starting determination of funding for new players


[26-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	But, secondarily... CIS does seem to be the primary currency for the majority of active players on Etherwind (at least based on the currency selected for most of the LM ads over the past couple months since I've been out here


[26-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	(/sarcasm on) Lastly, because CIS is the currency of the backwater armpit of the galaxy ruled by evil corporations - Benten and its surrounding systems.  (/sarcasm off)


[26-Oct-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	hm


[26-Oct-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	forgot Etherwind is a starting planet now... makes sense


[26-Oct-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	guess iam packing up moria


[26-Oct-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iamnopirate**:	hope Benten can deal with the product


[26-Oct-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I don't know if NCC is a wise choice. CIS is the most common,but if the goal is to separate EW from CIS/Prox - then AIC would be the only logical choice


[26-Oct-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	With ANT system next door


[26-Oct-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	wouldnt that make trade with all the adjacent planets really difficult?


[26-Oct-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spentaneous**:	*adjacent systems


[26-Oct-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don't agree that the point of EW is to "separate" from CI.


[26-Oct-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's a primary supply line for H2O


[26-Oct-21 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	The point is to simply get the popi situation in check, and do it in least intrusive way


[26-Oct-21 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	most of the trades on our LM are done in CIS, i'd assume most contributors to popi also operate in CIS


[26-Oct-21 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	and i'd assume most people here also operate in benten area mostly


[26-Oct-21 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	No idea where the notion of "separation" comes from


[26-Oct-21 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Anyone running Katoa > EW in the ner future? I've got the project's BDE available, just need to get it here. Don't want to send it coach in case I hit another new player who quits mid flight _again_


[26-Oct-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	I'll have my ship at katoa in 23 hours, then going to prox in another 24 hours and then to etherwind


[26-Oct-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	So if 3 and some days is fine i can grab it on my way back


[26-Oct-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I don't disagree. ANT is the one who needs H2O much more than Prox ever will


[26-Oct-21 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	And I'm simply adding on to the Convo about why not NCC from the one at 4PM server time today


[26-Oct-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Might need a sooner solution Fuurin but I can call in favours from Katoa, just wanted to try my luck here


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	What are you needing neke/


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Shipping 21 BDE Katoa to Etherwind


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	ok, whats the problem/


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	(ready in 34 minutes)


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	why is this stupid keyboard not doing ?


[26-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Oh I'm asking if anyone is available to take the shipping


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I can post an ad, but I've lost two shipments to new players in the last 5 days


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and both shipments were posted to ratings of C+ !!!


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	thats just bad luck :(


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I know


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's the only two I've ever had


[26-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	but also the timelines are tight, got 51 hours


[26-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	Katoa is a terrible place for shipments as of late, people also take shipments and then wait entire 2-3 days period that you get for shipment pickup


[26-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah that's the other problem


[26-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	and then send slow burn flights once they get full ship for another 2-3 days


[26-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You reckon ANT needs water @Rwinner16 I might head that way next then


[26-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	What's good shopping over there


[26-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	BSE seems to be the only thing worth buying..


[26-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I legt thought Benten was the worst exchange but I think it might be Antares lol


[26-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	always has been


[26-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Guess could fly there and try FXOB my way back to CIS


[26-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	watch arclight frontier project actually get the cx once its done and off the bat become better place than antares cx


[26-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I thought ANT would have metals/fabs but.. I guess none of the stuff from the martian moons ever hits the CX?


[26-Oct-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	Wouldnt be surprised if it hit a cx, but in benten


[26-Oct-21 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@neke - I'm happy to extend the contracts to allow for you to locate shipping - post the ads here, less likely to get poached by the newer Katoa players.   Heck, make it a 2 day delivery window....


[26-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Will do that if I haven't secured a known shipper in the next few hours - thanks for that

[27-Oct-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Please feel free to also message me directly if you would like to contribute or have any outstanding questions.   I will try to check in-game chat at least once daily to respond to any questions/concerns


[27-Oct-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Of course, we won't say no to any direct contributions of the l-fabs for the ADM, but if you plan on bringing some, can you let me know so that I don't also purchase any unnecessary items.


[27-Oct-21 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Any remaining value in the contribution pool will be transferred to the governor for use as a starting balance to fund/purchase consumables and to serve as a small currency exchange for any residents that would have trouble with CIS based production fees


[27-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Brief update - I have already received 200K in pledges towards donations, and some pledged direct donations.  We only have ~ 30-40K left to finance.

[27-Oct-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I think


[27-Oct-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	30-40K out of an estimated total cost of 380K for the ADM - direct donations of 210K have been received, 60K is left from the prior drive for the SST and consumables that surpassed the need, and some of the estimated cost was reduced by direct donations of some of the ADM supplies


[27-Oct-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I will finance the remainder myself if no further donations are received


[27-Oct-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	i have NCC


[27-Oct-21 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If you would like to contribute - 10K gets you a fancy DW in a commemorative glass, 25K earns an embroidered PWO to wear on cold days, and 50K gets a locally brewed COF in a collectors mug you can use to impress clients in your corporate HQ.  Let me know if you are interested - NCC is accepted :)


[27-Oct-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If you need to exchange some NCC for CIS - I'm also happy to help with that to ensure you have production fees available once the ADM goes up


[27-Oct-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have both, but by far more NCC

[31-Oct-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@opie - Not exactly sure why it shows ICA, I suspect that is still a hold-over from Etherwind being a non-faction planet and not having an ADM.  When they added it as a potential starting planet, it was "aligned" with Castillo-Ito due to the proximity to the CX and the need for new players to have an appropriate default currency pool

**Ritteruk**:	Damn, thats a lot of open jobs!


[03-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Gonna have to keep that safety up to build the PIO number


[03-Nov-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	nah, open jobs will push up happiness; it's already growing, will grow faster with open jobs


[03-Nov-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Good point, happiness is above 70% so they will grow


[03-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Yeah - we should get quite a boost next week on the POPR, but I do think we want to keep the SST pretty well supplied for the next week with DW and OFF :)


[03-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	SUN consumption will fall after the tick, so we're working on what was consumed 2 days ago already


[03-Nov-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	I have 100 OFF here and 500 in the queue on Umbra, can make some SUN if needed to.


[03-Nov-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	DW should not be an issue on a water planet!


[03-Nov-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Thanks @ritteruk - if you are willing to donate them until we get the ADM up and can then reimburse with production fee revenue, that would be great.   If you need some coverage for the cost, let it be known here or in UFO and I'm sure we can get some contributors to help :)


[03-Nov-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	On the ADM note - all of the remaining elements are under contract and just awaiting delivery and/or shipment to Etherwind.  I think we'll be live with that around the weekend or early next week.


[03-Nov-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Will make some more SUN and pop them in for next POPR, it only checks the upkeep when the POPR comes out right?


[03-Nov-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	If it checks all the way through I will need to up production :)


[03-Nov-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I believe that it checks the amount supplied at the most recent consumption point(s) - so for DW, it'll average the %filled per consumption across 2.33 consumptions, same for OFF, and for SUN, should just check the most recent one.


[03-Nov-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I'll ask in UFO to see if PiBoy can clarify that...


[03-Nov-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	This is how I think it is supposed to work, will let you know if I get another answer - "For example, if 60% of SUN is supplied and consumed 2 days into the POPR period, but 100% SUN was supplied during the preceding period; then the SUN bonus for the SST would = 0.6 * 5 + 1.0 * 2 since the 100% fulfillment covered 2 days of the week and the 60% fulfillment covers the other 5."


[03-Nov-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	So - that is somewhat correct, but not exact per PiBoy on the way the calculations work (but somewhat approaches it still in practical application).  As such, @ritteruk, there isn't any rush on the SUN this week, but we should try and get them on planet before the consumption tick in 8.5 days

Once those have been contributed, I'll add the electronics and finish the construction (probably about 22 hours from now).  Have your "campaign speech" ready to post to attract those voters!

[07-Nov-21 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Taxes would start at "faction minimum" for the first week, but should be able to be lowered to just maintain enough weekly income to support the POPI needs - for which I will place purchase ads weekly on the LM so that our residents can benefit from the return of their production fees by providing opportunities to grab those contracts when posted


[07-Nov-21 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bugleberry**:	Is two rigs enough to provide H2O for a single food processor making DW?


[09-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	it is roughly a 2:1 ratio, yes


[09-Nov-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I think a little less than 2:1


[09-Nov-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Great, thanks


[09-Nov-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@bugleberry - With no experts and the CoGC bonus, each RIG should produce roughly 50 H2O per day, if you run the 10:7 DW recipe, you should be pretty well balanced as that runs 10 cycles per 24 hours for a net consumption of 100 H2O per day


[09-Nov-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I think it's technically 52-53 H2O per day at 100% worker satisfaction and 25% CoGC bonus, but if you are below 100% satisfaction, then both buildings will be reduced by the same efficiency amount to still leave you with that rough balance


[09-Nov-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I got four rigs producing 9 units of H2O per 4h 16min, and two FPs producing DW from 20 H2O total every 2h 41m


[09-Nov-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	idk, I'm bad at math


[09-Nov-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	even helps you make a "shopping" list of what you'll need for what buildings


[09-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Yeah I'm running a slight surplus on H2O assuming the current advertising campaign doesn't stop


[09-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	COGC will likely run on extraction till end of times


[09-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I personally run full Extraction experts for my DW, really cuts the ratio down


[09-Nov-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Don't have enough experts yet


[09-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	It comes pretty fast.  I just transitioned my second DW base to full experts, cuts the cost per unit nicely (even will full experts and COGC here, H2O is still the most expensive part)

**Gravy**:	that our future governor has some work to do :)


[09-Nov-21 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	but really, safety limits how happy and therefore how fast our pioneers grow


[09-Nov-21 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	is there some place in the manual where population is explained?  I didn't see that covered in the help files.


[09-Nov-21 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@opie, Not as well as we would like.  Some of the factors have had to be closely followed an modeled by a few very interested players.  We're leveraging their expertise!


[09-Nov-21 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Just curious - where did you see the 48.6% on the safety indicator?


[09-Nov-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-21 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	But when I put in a new order in one of my production buildings, it says that pioneers are at 100%


[09-Nov-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	If we have less than 50% safety then shouldn't they be at less than 100%.


[09-Nov-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	So, there's your base's pioneer satisfaction based on whether you are supplying DW, RAT, OVE, PWO, and COF - which is separate from the planetary happiness indicator


[09-Nov-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	the planetary happiness indicator does not influence your populations productivity, but rather the potential for population expansion/growth on the planet as a whole


[09-Nov-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	We want to keep general PIO happiness >70% as influenced by open jobs/unemployment and safety to maintain good growth for new buildings to be able to be fully staffed


[09-Nov-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	oh i see


[09-Nov-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Since we finished the last POPR with 1700 PIO jobs open (meaning more jobs than available PIOs), we will want to maximize Safety for the next several weeks to try and maintain growth


[09-Nov-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	the displayed safety indicator in the POPR is a weight sum of the previous 3 weeks and current week, weighted as 0.2 (n-3), 0.2(n-2), 0.2(n-1), and 0.4 (n=current week)


[09-Nov-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	I have no worker shortage, though.  Is that because I supply all  the luxuries?


[09-Nov-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	so, supplying the second SST and working to maintain its full supply of DW, SUN, and OFF will be a significant goal for the coming few weeks until we can grow enough to have about 10% unemployment (minimum) to allow for plenty of PIOs in the reserve pool every week


[09-Nov-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Or if I build a new facility will it be unstaffed?


[09-Nov-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	It could be limited staffing - depends on how many PIOs are left in the reserve pool.  I'll admit to not being directly familiar with the reserve pool size calculation though


[09-Nov-21 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	lets say you are at 300 PIOs working, and build 100 PIOs worth of new buildings - but only see (50) in the construction screen for the number of PIOs you can recruit.


[09-Nov-21 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	You will end up with 400 jobs, staffed by 350 workers - each building therefore would get 87.5% of its jobs filled (350/400) reducing your overall efficiency to a max of that 87.% per building (before CoGC bonus, experts, etc)

**DocWatz**:	For all here - I have updated the local rules as stated in the 'campaign' to initial production fees at 'faction minimum' of 10 CIS per day per building across the board.  LM and WAR fees have been set below that at 10/1 and 50/week.


[10-Nov-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If you need some CIS seed funding for the production fees, please reach out here and there are a few of us that would be happy to help arrange an on planet currency exchange of some kind!


[10-Nov-21 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Ad up for 10 SUN to try and max that consumption out in a couple days - I know it's short notice, but have my fingers crossed someone will be able to pick that up in time...


[10-Nov-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	WOW!  Everyone is expanding their bases on Etherwind!  While we gained 4.1K Pioneers overall, we still have about 2.1 K open jobs that didn't get filled on this POPR


[10-Nov-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Safety stayed stable around 81%.  If that trend continues around the same for the next week, I'll look at how we set up an SST#3 to continue to maintain appropriate safety to prompt even more growth.

[11-Nov-21 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Brief financial update.... I'll be watching this through the next few days, but looks like our daily revenue is coming in at around 3K CIS per day with the current production fee set up.  That'll put us projected with a shortage of funding to maintain the upkeeps fully from the budget, but I am willing to continue at these tax rates for a bit to see how it works out.  It could mean that we rely on some donation of DW towards upkeep but use the fees to purchase primarily the additional inputs (OFF/SUN/MCG/PE/RAT)


[11-Nov-21 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	That seems a little lower than I expected though - at 10 per building per day, my base alone should contribute ~300 per day to that, so the income so far seems to estimate that we only have about 10 fully filled bases on planet?  Very well could see that number change significantly in the next couple days though


[11-Nov-21 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Some bases might have big orders, if I recall the tax change hits when the next order hits the line?


[11-Nov-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I think so - and it doesn't seem to post until the "taxed order" is fully completed as well


[11-Nov-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	So, hoping that the first 24 hours is an underestimation


[11-Nov-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@plutoniumJesus - yeah, I forget how many people use longer running/larger batch orders.  I guess I've never been that bothered by the NOTS for having shorter production runs in general - and prefer the flexibility to switch production on shorter notice at times

[11-Nov-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Anybody got 7 BDE on EW I can buy?


[11-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner - I have 4 BDE available on EW right now.


[11-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@realbandit - Thanks for the DW donation to the SST upkeep!


[11-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	To all:  I plan to post some CoGC upkeep ads in <12 hours.  Pricing planned for:


[11-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	42 CIS per RAT (lots of 40)


[11-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	30 CIS per DW (lots of 50)


[11-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	12 CIS per MCG (lots of 50)


[11-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	4 CIS per PE (lots of 100)


[12-Nov-21 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Ads have been posted for ~1/2 of the COGC upkeep needs


[12-Nov-21 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Thanks @alxnns for picking up the DW ads for the CoGC!


[12-Nov-21 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Just hit me up for reminders of the DW. I don't have an issue hitting the donates for that


[12-Nov-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Estimated tax revenue update - almost 10K has attributed it appears in the past 24 hours.  First actual receipt of tax revenue is still about 2.5 days out, but should set us up well to afford more of the inputs.  If that daily number holds true, then I likely will drop production fees in ~10 days (after the first full tax period)


[12-Nov-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Do you get to see revenues by base, or just the planetary?


[12-Nov-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	It's not very detailed....really just planetary - and right now, I'm just having to follow the 'balance' listed for the CORPFIN buffer as it is the collection of those revenues until disbursement as the dividend to allow them to be realized and used


[12-Nov-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Not even a breakdown of production vs LM vs WAR


[12-Nov-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	And definitely no breakdown between production-RE, production - FP, etc


[12-Nov-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	so I wonder how Proxion is knowing which fees to raise/lower


[12-Nov-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alxnns**:	Might be worth asking Corlis


[12-Nov-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	My understanding is that Proxion runs higher fees for electronics since that industry is higher profit/yield and primarily employees the upper tiers that take more to support growth with the upkeep


[12-Nov-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Then they run a little higher on agriculture with the combined CoGC and fertility bonus offsetting that from being a significant "penalty" to agriculture production


[12-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	hmm. 20/u still isn't high enough for a trip to Moria. Grr


[12-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	20/t


[12-Nov-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	@docwatz how much for your 4 BDE


[12-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner - sent you a direct message with price


[12-Nov-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Rwinner would


[12-Nov-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	yoy


[12-Nov-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	mind paying NCC? that might incentivize a taker


[12-Nov-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Because I don’t think many would be flying that route empty, and if you’re doing it in that direction you can’t take your own goods and have no NCC to spend at destination


[12-Nov-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	On that topic; I’ll free up a freighter to alleviate some of this shipping backlog, it’ll come from Katoa so if anyone has KAT>BEN please post in the next few hours and let me know! I can even do KAT>BEN>EW if there’s enough


[12-Nov-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I need to stock up on fuel to play space trucker


[12-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	changed currency


[12-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@bugleberry - if you have enough fuel to make Proxion from Etherwind (68 FF) plus Proxion to BEN (14 FF) - you could probably grab a good number of the Etherwind to Proxion shipments and then swing by the CX for the fuel...


[12-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	There are regularly Proxion to BEN shipments also posted on LM UV-796b


[12-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	depending on the price you ask for, i can probably also full time your ship just for my own shipments for prox ew ew prox flights


[12-Nov-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Yeah that's the problem. I screwed up my fuel situation so I only have enough to get to BEN


[12-Nov-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Where's your boat now?


[12-Nov-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Home


[12-Nov-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Both of them


[12-Nov-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Sunrise has been a faithful traveller, while Sunset has been parked for a while


[12-Nov-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Grab some open shippong ads to Ben, and I'll fill the rest of your boat with stuff I can sell. I'll give a premium to help you get fuel to refill both boats.


[12-Nov-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Your boats should very rarely be idle.


[12-Nov-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Didn't even notice ads for BEN flights


[12-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It's one of those trade offs for new players. Use your boats to make some excess liquid cash at the expense of condition. In 3 months when your condition gets to the point of needing addressed, your base is expanded to the point of being able to afford it.


[12-Nov-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	My boats aren't idle for more than a couple hours at a time.


[12-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Well if you have something for BEN station, you can put up a contract, I can fly it. No need for premium payment though


[12-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Got 320/420 of space left


[12-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Are both your boats empty on sf and ff?


[12-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	One of them is


[12-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Other one has enough FF to fly to BEN station, and plenty of SF


[12-Nov-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Also my free space is 420m3/320t


[12-Nov-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	600 FF and 2500 SF sounds close to what you need?


[12-Nov-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Rough numbers are close enough


[12-Nov-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Ready m


[12-Nov-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Ad going up

[12-Nov-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Damn


[12-Nov-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	That's a high reward


[12-Nov-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That is the amount needed (rough) to get the above stated fuel


[12-Nov-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Well, my cargohold is full so I'll depart it now


[12-Nov-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Get your fleet back in the air :)


[12-Nov-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Thank you


[12-Nov-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	It'll be there in about 16 hours


[12-Nov-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Does anybody have 3 BDE on EW that I can buy?


[12-Nov-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If not - Bugleberry, can you pick up a shipping ad for 3 from Ben CX to EW on your way back?


[13-Nov-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Yeah, will do


[13-Nov-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I'll arive in BEN in four hours


[13-Nov-21 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DocWatz**:	Early FYI - first partial week tax income will be posted in about 3 hours.  I'll put up contracts for the remaining SST upkeep for the coming week once that has been received.  I'll post a brief update here and a longer one in UFO in about 5 hours with that information


[14-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have some of next weeks upkeeps stuff ready


[14-Nov-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Moria needs rocks SIO.NC1 !  Will (you) answer the call?


[14-Nov-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I can sell you some rocks at no where near that price if you want to take some


[14-Nov-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But I won’t personally be flying rocks to Moria and given how difficult shipping out of here is, I don’t expect a shipping contract to work out


[14-Nov-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	What are you trying to get the SST reserves to?


[14-Nov-21 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner16 - Given the current finances, I'm going to work towards filling them up and then just being able to post for the consumed amounts as they come due


[14-Nov-21 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	First batches of OFF/SUN orders from the completed 4.5 day tax period have been posted on Etherwind LM


[14-Nov-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Given the tax income that we saw, I have adjusted the SUN price per unit from 175 up to 200 each for this cycle


[14-Nov-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	What kind of cash are you needing to get everything full?


[14-Nov-21 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Brief financial summary for those intersted.  Last week, a total of 10,450 was spent to secure upkeeps prior to tax revenues being available.  We received 41,650 in production fees through the past 4.5 days with an estimated weekly upkeep cost of 39K per week.   Since the CoGC and SST are fully funded, I will still plan on putting up purchase orders from the weekly upkeep quantities of those items and will store them in a WAR when received to clearly indicate their use for planetary upkeep


[14-Nov-21 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	it appears we are net positive at the moment?


[14-Nov-21 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If daily incoming revenue continues to look as strong as it has with this cycle, I anticipate dropping per building-day production fees from 10 to 8 with the next completed revenue period


[14-Nov-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Yes - very much so @rwinner16, thus the hope to reduce those production fees by ~25% in a week :)


[14-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I'll let this batch of LM orders be up for 12 hours or so and then may post a few more for the OFF/SUN balances along with some DW and RAT LM ads


[14-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Everyone got all their positions filled on the current POPR!  We're at 3.4% PIO unemployment, which isn't a lot of extra PIOs to be available for new buildings.  Safety dropped to 66% satisfaction - I'm assuming from the combination of >5% population growth and the limited fulfillment on the SUN inputs.   If we don't have some takers for those SUN orders, then I'll be planning out a 3rd SST within the next couple weeks using the excess upkeep funds that haven't been used for those SUN.  Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns from this week's population update.


[17-Nov-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Always just let me know How I can help ^^


[17-Nov-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If I need to order SUNs from CX, or whatever


[17-Nov-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	If the current ads expire without fulfillment, I'll probably order some within the corp - but I will give them a few more days to see if they are fulfilled that way


[17-Nov-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@rwinner16 - 100 SUN secured on Proxion... if you happen to have a ship there heading back to EW, let me know and I'll have them ride with you

**DocWatz**:	Etherwind residents - it was a great week for our first full week of production fee revenue @ 10 CIS per day per building.  We received 92,650.00 CIS in tax revenue.  You likely have notice the ads posted for the next week consumables including enough OFF to stock the reserve fully for our SSTs


[21-Nov-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I have earmarked 20% of this weeks revenue towards capital projects, including an SST#3 to support continued strong PIO growth on planet


[21-Nov-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I will be decreasing the production fees by 25% as well, since we don't need to maintain 90K in weekly upkeep, that should allow financing of the SST within the next week or two.   If you are active in UFO Discord, please keep an eye out for postings around that project within the next week or so.


[21-Nov-21 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@zarik - Thanks for the remaining RAT needed for the upcoming CoGC upkeep.  We're stocked for most of those inputs already and I will contribute those already received following the CoGC upkeep reset in ~12 hours


[22-Nov-21 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Thanks @Ritteruk for all of the OFF!  We have filled reserves pretty well for SST upkeep.  Ads are up for the remaining MCG and PE for the CoGC upkeep as well

**DocWatz**:	Weekly governor update:  Income from production fees (even with 6/7 days reduced from 10 to 8) was 85890 CIS.  We spent 70800 (and received an estimated 24K worth of donated upkeeps).  Current EW governor balance is 92540 CIS.


[28-Nov-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	With the continued lower than hoped for safety numbers this week, I will plan to move forward with purchases towards an SST #3.   If you are active in the UFO Discord - https://discord.gg/74XYQFfN - then please see the #Etherwind-general channel for updates on that process in ~1.5-2 days

**DocWatz**:	Last - Election season is upon us again in the next couple days!  I welcome @rwinner16, @jelutz, and @spice to the debate.  My 'campaign' will be focused on continuing to support Etherwind as I have the past 3 weeks with purchases to maintain COGC and SST upkeep.  I will continue to model 'tax revenue' and further reduce production fee rates following the election if the weekly income continues to outpace the needed funds for weekly upkeep

**Spice**:	- More POPI, personally will finance more SST and INF.


[29-Nov-21 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	-Will temporarily pay premium prices for upkeep materials (with my own money, taxes will be spent responsibly) If elected I will organise dedicated and above market trade routes to ensure Etherwinds continued Upkeep needs


[29-Nov-21 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	- SNF Corp backing to turn develop Etherwind's buildings as it is lagging far behind similar planets


[29-Nov-21 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@spice - how much/how far do you envision that Etherwind needs to develop its' buildings?  We have generally not been seen as a planet needing to push into higher population tiers and the growth has been adequate to allow for job creation for both PIO and SET through the past couple weeks.   I do agree that another SST (or 2) are looking necessary though :)


[29-Nov-21 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Also - Ads posted with "E" rating are for this weeks POPI upkeep.   They'll all be available for the next 5 days :)


[29-Nov-21 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Thats all good, I posted some lucrative ads up for supplies on lm 9 ( in NCC)


[29-Nov-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Pretty against NCC as a currency, that has been debated and decided soundly


[29-Nov-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Ive dicussed the currency change and we have agreed that CIS is the best for Etherwind


[29-Nov-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Now my campaign is simple, lower taxes, and personally finance upkeep and any new buildings wanted.


[29-Nov-21 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Why personally finance things?


[29-Nov-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	I think Doc has been doing a great job.  He quickly organized the materials donated to make the ADM, which established the govt necessary for maintaining the upkeep for infrastructure.


[29-Nov-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	Since then he has organized the construction of the minimal amt of infrastructure required to continue Ether's growth and production as the primary H2O source for the Castillo-Ito region


[29-Nov-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	With the lowest taxes and LM rates in the region as well.


[29-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-21 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah there small


[30-Nov-21 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	My campaign is more " im going to build a bunch" than taxes, taxes are kind of irrelevant if you dont have buildings to upkeep.


[30-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Etherwind residents - I have posted ads (see the "E" rating to identify them) for a majority of the b-fabs, MCG, and TRU needed for SST#3).  Each ad will be up for 3 days with 3 day fulfillment.  This will pretty closely use all of our current budget, but should allow our Safety to improve slightly to ensure continued PIO growth

**DocWatz**:	All Etherwind Residents - @spice has very generously offered to still personally fund POPI improvements on Etherwind to the tune of a 200K CIS donation towards the capital fund.     I will look at the outstanding items that we need to complete the SST#3 and probably also will start to post purchase ads towards an INF components.   The plan will still be to continue low tax rates overall to fund upkeep primarily.  We have had very reasonable growth the past couple of POPR, but a little extra Health to promote continued SET growth is not unreasonable.


[01-Dec-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Setio**:	What is POPR?


[01-Dec-21 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	Population Report. The population of a planet requires various conditions in order to grow. Once per week the fullfillment is checked and the population of a planet grows or doesnt


[01-Dec-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	Thats whay Doc currently builds various Population Infrastructure Buildings (POPI) to support these conditions and prevent the popuation from declining


[01-Dec-21 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	u can see these information if u open a new buffer and type in : POPR KW-688c


[01-Dec-21 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Setio**:	So population is depend on gov works. How about the demand of population in this planet?


[01-Dec-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	it can either be done by a gov who spends the tax on it or the players of a planet can do it themselves. But as those buildings required regular upkeep which will become quite expensive at one point, its easier and more fair if its done by taxes


[01-Dec-21 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I think the PrUn Wiki has a section about Pupulation needs, infrastrcute etc. if ur interessted to learn more


[01-Dec-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	but since u just started, thats not too important for you in the first place :)

[01-Dec-21 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Setio**:	That is all i can di now


[01-Dec-21 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	if u made a mistake in construction, dont worry about COLIQ (delete your company) and start new


[01-Dec-21 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	and u wont be able to build a farm on Etherwind as the planet isnt fertile


[01-Dec-21 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	while it is fertile, it's quite inefficient


[01-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	It is fertile but the bar is negative which means that farms receive a big reduction to their productivity


[01-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	If you want to stick in the Benten region you can also look at Proxion for farming


[01-Dec-21 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	at 140% efficiency selling at >90 NCC per unit, you'll be making 2.5k per extractor per day which is great for a pioneer building


[01-Dec-21 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	the only drawback is that you'll run out of shipping capacity eventually, but it's still the best way to get money on etherwind


[01-Dec-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Setio**:	Superb logistic info. Thabk you @opie


[01-Dec-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Weekly POPR report doesn't have any huge surprises.   We had enough growth to continue to have some unemployment in both PIOs and SETs jobs.  Build those buildings and employ those folks that are out of work!   With full input fulfillment on the 2nd SST, we did see some growth in Safety this week, but probably will need that 3rd SST to be running within a couple weeks to maintain good growth potential

**DocWatz**:	In preparation for the SST#3 and INF#1 - I have posted a few upkeep ads for OFF and TUB.  They should stay visible for 5 days.  Thanks, -Gov Doc :)


[03-Dec-21 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	We still have about 2.5 weeks worth of SUN available, but will probably put ads up on Monday or Tuesday for weekly MCG, PE, RAT, and DW needs


[05-Dec-21 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Etherwind residents - taxes were stable this week with total income of 85830 CIS.


[05-Dec-21 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DocWatz**:	And I didn't send a financial update yesterday - we received 91K CIS in production fees.  I have set another 20% of that into the capital budget to finance another SST to continue to provide strong PIO job support/growth.  If anyone is interested in supplying TRU or b-fabs, please let me know quantity available and price.  I can respond a bit better in Discord, but in game chat works as well

[22-Dec-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	This week's POPR is still reassuring.  We haven't quite hit 100% Safety satisfaction, but PIO happiness and growth is still strong (~50% more PIO growth compared to last week).   SET education still more than offsets the small loss to migration with growing unemployment there.  I'll continue to work towards the next SST to keep that safety happy; however if we start to see growth in SET jobs being created and less 'reserve' on that front, we can then pursue another INF.

With that in mind, and with @rwinner16 consistently showing his willingness to support the planet financially, I will be stepping out of the upcoming race for Etherwind and helping a corpmate with administration elsewhere for the next month or so

[03-Jan-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	I can take some of my TUB off of the CX and contribute.


[03-Jan-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Ship on Katoa available for a trip back to EW. Optionally via another location. Looking for 10 per m/t.


[03-Jan-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Took contracts for Katoa > BEN, so now available to ship from BEN to EW.


[03-Jan-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-22 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	but I have 4 shipments inbound already to account for as well


[03-Jan-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-22 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Rwinner16 - sorry, holidays and work have been pretty demanding the past couple weeks.  Trying to get caught back up with everything.  Please let me know (Discord is probably best) if there is anything else I can do to help ease the transition


[03-Jan-22 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I still have 100 MCG and 158 PE earmarked for the next CoGC upkeep cycle as well, purchased with prior taxes, so I'll donate them when that opens up in a week


[03-Jan-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Howdy. I have 5 shipments on BEN ready to go to EW whenever someone has an open vessel. They are all for either planetary upkeeps, or to upgrade POPI's.


[05-Jan-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I believe I will have a mostly-empty ship headed this way from BEN in a day or two. I'll keep an eye out for them if others haven't already picked them up


[05-Jan-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I haven't posted them. What rate do you want?


[05-Jan-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I have one ship ready, just need it to pay for fuel.


[05-Jan-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It is at Ben?


[05-Jan-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jan-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Yeah that's plenty, don't worry


[05-Jan-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I'll have it run back and forth. We count inventory at work right now so I'm tight on time, second ship is underway to BEN though.


[05-Jan-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	Oh, those wont fill one cargohold, that's alrighty then


[05-Jan-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Nah. That's just the stuff to finish out SST5, and 1300 OFF's


[05-Jan-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	More I go over the calculator chart, the more it seems SST is the only thing we really need atm


[05-Jan-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bugleberry**:	I understood it as five full hold shipments


[05-Jan-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Howdy all! Looking at the most recent POPR, it looks like we have everything set up really well to maintain status quo on our T1/T2. I don't see any reason to upgrade POPIs any further, or change the input requirements past the current levels. My big question for you is: Does anyone here have a desire for techs or engineers? We just got to 100% full tech employment, so the opportunity to fill any demands is there upcoming. If we don't have a desire for more, we can level off the popi and call it good!

[18-Jan-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Rwinner16 - I have capacity to make TUB on Etherwind to help with upkeep


[18-Jan-22 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I  would be willing to supply for Etherwind @ 75 per TUB


[18-Jan-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	And 200 every 10 days should be within production capacity


[18-Jan-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	I make SUN


[18-Jan-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	@Rwinner16


[18-Jan-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	well i can make them, if you want a regular supply that is


[18-Jan-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	@DocWatz, I would greatly appreciate if you could supply me 200 TUB per 10d. That # might increase to 300/cycle shortly. Once i finish this big internal task, INF 3 is my next goal.


[18-Jan-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	@opie, I would love to make a standing offer for SUN. It looks like I currently need 150/10days, but that will be raising to 200/10days soon as well.


[18-Jan-22 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Doc - I'm thinking the TUB price should be closer to 85/90. I don't want you to short yourself.


[18-Jan-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	okay.  i sell SUN for 200/u


[18-Jan-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Same concern with that. I don't want you to short yourself. Just going off CX, I'd have assumed 225-250


[18-Jan-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I mean, I'd love the 75 and 200 price points, but only if ya'll are okay with them


[18-Jan-22 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	200 CIS / SUN is already 4.5k per day per BMP but if you wanna pay me more than go for it


[18-Jan-22 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	then


[18-Jan-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	When can you start on the SUN? EW currently needs 300 to fill the reserves, and another 150 sometime after 2d4h


[18-Jan-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	We can also do where you do sell ads with 20d deliveries - fill at your leisure.


[18-Jan-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	i can make them right now, it will take a few days for 300 to be manufactured


[18-Jan-22 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Sound good!


[19-Jan-22 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	oh well


[20-Jan-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The massive buy order is to create a price floor so all the buyers low balling us will have to pay up - it’s pointless if we all just sling water into it


[20-Jan-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ill remove it and you can go back to getting 15-16 for water


[20-Jan-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Niegrozny**:	well, I've understood your point. But you've also artificially created a high demand for water and for a hefty price. Every buyer with a calculator and a high demand will go to another market. Sad that i've sent already my ship to Hortus tho, but maybe I'll import something else from there :)


[20-Jan-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Niegrozny**:	also you would end up with lots and lots of water which you wouldn't be able to - well - liquidate :D


[20-Jan-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Niegrozny**:	And probably all the producers would fill you up before I could be back form Hortus :P


[20-Jan-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Niegrozny**:	Now that you've monopolized water for brief time you could benefit from that, but market will regulate itself


[20-Jan-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Probably just flip the water. Those unwilling to wait will have to pay it


[20-Jan-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Niegrozny**:	@jelutz77 it's the aftermath. Eelier neke86 was also bidding 25k at 29.99


[20-Jan-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	that was the point but not going to work


[20-Jan-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	if we all queue first in first out at a price, we all get a good price, instead we have to move one cent at a time


[20-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	They also have implemented government Programs to provide immediate boosts to the planet. 1) Immigration to provide immediate POPI to the planet (pick tier). 2) Family Support to provide week long growth of T1-T3 POP. 3) Education to boost the level of POPI who would Tier Up to the next level (PIO to SET, SET to TECH, etc.), and 4) Festivities which provide weeklong happiness boost to all POPI tiers.

**Rwinner16**:	Hey guys! So with this update came a huge development on obtaining scientists. They've added a weekly program to get 25. I can already see a lot of planets running that. What do guys want to do?


[12-Feb-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Personally, I don't want to. Etherwind has a very good niche on H2o output and location between the Ant and Ben. I think we should focus on excelling on our natural bonus. But I'll run with the consensus.


[12-Feb-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	My 1 vote is for resource extraction and focusing on T1 here. Proxion and Katoa are nearby and developing quickly, what do we want to do here with SCI?


[12-Feb-22 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I also think that with everyone rushing for sci, we are headed for a system wide shortage on con inputs and lower tier items. We're already seeing spikes in H2o, dw, rat, etc.


[12-Feb-22 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carcissia**:	agreed, I don't think Etherwind needs scientists


[12-Feb-22 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	adding my vote to continue focus on resource extraction


[12-Feb-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadPhoenix**:	same here with ResEx. Also, didnt they also say that people leave faster too if theire needs aren`t met? That sounds like a lot of those planets might loose theire sci without the appropiate infrastructure to maintain them...

It is severely "OP" IMO, and I'll be running it for the next weekly cycle. Expect a bunch of T1 and T2 POP to Become T2/T3 on next POPR. Just giving every1 a heads up incase any T2/T3 build ideas were in thoughts.

[28-Feb-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I don't know about other players, but our corp produces massive amounts of COF right here, pretty good spot for it with the cheap and plentiful H2O


[28-Feb-22 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	^^^ Same with FIO. Almost all of our DW and COF supply for Ben and Ant come from here.


[28-Feb-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	Etherwind, for now, is purely a water base which I move to Proxion


[28-Feb-22 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Morning. After looking at the POPR, it looks like we're pretty stable for PIO/SET if we maintain current POPI's investments. With current PIO #'s and unemployment rates staying stable, I think we are good to maintain for awhile. There isn't much I can do about the ENG dropoff; Etherwind just doesn't have the demand to keep them.

[26-Apr-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Second, for anyone who might be wishing that Etherwind's COGC was Food Industries instead of Resource Extraction, I have some news... KW-602c, a tier 1 planet just a single, short hop to the east of EW (less than 6 hours—far closer than Milliways) now has a COGC that will be Food Industries focused after this first Pioneer cycle. Hopefully I'll see a few of you join me there...


[26-Apr-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	oO you compete with Milliways?


[26-Apr-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Not necessarily. People who grow on Katoa will still go to Milliways to do their processing. I just wanted something closer to EW. For folks who grow on Nemesis, it might be a horse a piece.


[26-Apr-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	HYFs...


[29-Apr-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That was meant in reply to @neke86. HYFs produce materials far faster than FRMs. Generally poorer ROI, but there are ways around that...


[29-Apr-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah I didn't realise anyone actually did it though


[29-Apr-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And if so, at the poorer ROI, why provide RAT cheaply etc


[29-Apr-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	With H2O selling very firmly in the 18-20 CIS bracket the HYF-based RAT cost must be significant


[29-Apr-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes it is, production costs of RAT with FP <30/unit and with HYF 35-38/unit

***Gholgota** left.*


[29-Apr-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Oh that's still less than I thought


[29-Apr-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	What parameters did you use to get that cost?


[29-Apr-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For FP (MAI+BEA+NUT): H2O=25/unit (set it a bit higher), production costs incl. consumption MAI= ~55/unit // BEA= ~62/unit // NUT= ~51/unit. For FP 55+62+51=168 inputs + 73 consumption + 7 rounding up = 248 costs for 10 RAT


[29-Apr-22 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Nice! I use BEA+NUT+GRN (4/1 not 4/4) as it uses one less H2O than MAI, and the production cycles line up perfectly


[29-Apr-22 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For HYF with ALG+VEG+MAI inputs would be (again H2O=25/unit and NS=138/unit and incl consumption) ALG= ~81/unit VEG= ~113/unit MAI= ~109/unit. So 81+113+109=303 inputs + 73 + 7 = 383 for 10RAT


[29-Apr-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And neither of these figures include any ROI


[29-Apr-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But of course, other receipt possible and a combination of FRM+HYF and also H2O at 10/unit with own production and also NS much lower with own production. So HYF could may be reach 30/unit altogether


[29-Apr-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	So the much more expensive HYF building isn't factored in?


[29-Apr-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yes it can be lowered with accounting


[29-Apr-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But then you're just fudging numbers ;)


[29-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The "cost" of water rigged on Etherwind is close to nothing


[29-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	but if you're not selling it at 20


[29-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes right ... no time to include building costs and ROI


[29-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	My cost of RAT on Proxion is closer to 19/u


[29-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	which is almost exactly half, which is more what I was expecting


[29-Apr-22 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	add in repairs (MHL!!), ROI and the gap widens


[29-Apr-22 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	especially when NS trades closer to 200/u


[29-Apr-22 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Just want to show that the price of my OPPs listed at 50/unit was fair and yours at 80/unit is a bit high ;)


[29-Apr-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's not though, why sell 38/u RAT at 50/u


[29-Apr-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	That won't cover repairs and ROI :)


[29-Apr-22 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	it's only about 20/u profit per hour


[29-Apr-22 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's academic, because someone DID fill the order


[29-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But your costs are 19/unit and the shipping doesn't cost a lot per unit, so that's a high price at 80/unit. But no problem, DW and RAT currently have high prices and that's ok. Some people still prefer to sell locally for a lower price than shipping everything around to max. profit of every unit


[29-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	80 was just based on replenishing from market + shipping


[29-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	roughly equivalent to you not flying there and buying it


[29-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I sell my RAT at 50-60 on the CX (PRX > CX) or Katoa


[29-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes i understand, no problem at all


[29-Apr-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Same here, I sell DW on LM also for 45-50 instead of CX


[29-Apr-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Thanks for the run down though, I had written off HYFs for RAT as unviable, but it's just less viable

**neke86**:	Now to really muddy the water, what should the price of OVE be out here on EW?

**Ryst**:	If you buy everything (MHL, H2O, NS, etc.), of course it's going to be more expensive. Also, relativity and absolutism are factors. If you make 3/4 the profit but produce 2x the goods, the relative ROI per unit produced isn't as good. However, as long as there is a market for the goods, producing 2x the goods produces more (absolute) cash flow... which can be used to produce other things (some of which lower the cost of what you're already producing and some of which can be sold outright on its own).


[29-Apr-22 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Obviously, all these numbers are "academic" to make the point. In any case, different people do different things in different ways. So long as it's profitable, there are cases where *maximizing* profit comes with its own headaches and is more trouble than its worth. JMO.


[29-Apr-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Okay but how much should OVE sell for? :D


[29-Apr-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have a transport incoming myself but in general I would buy OVE/PWO 10-20% above CX prices here


[29-Apr-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	IMO, less than CX prices. Or, at least, no more than CX prices. OVE are easy to ship and inexpensive in the first place. Which means that they should be easy to have a long-term stock of sitting in inventory here (for someone who doesn't make them). I wouldn't pay more than CX price here—bid price, if there were recent sells to it—because I could just as easily put them on a ship that's heading here anyway.


[29-Apr-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Having said that, I'm not your ideal customer, so I'd also suggest not pricing them solely based on my opinion. 🤷‍♂️

[29-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Hmm, you‘re right. I also send every few days a ship here nearly empty to pick up DW. No problem and no additional costs to take OVE with me because my ship goes anyway and has space. May be I should rethink my generous opinion :)


[29-Apr-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I’ll keep funneling my product to the CX then !

**allocater**:	@all new players, if you accept a water future contract (marked F) you will get 12 free BSE to build the RIG to produce the water.


[29-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	^ this is a lie


[29-May-22 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Is it actually? I’ve done a lot of trade @allocator without any problem so far..


[29-May-22 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	you can also request the 12 BSE first with a buy-ad for 1CIS.


[29-May-22 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	since you can't barter it needs to be 2 contracts that are counter-signed


[29-May-22 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	obviously if I don'T deliver the 12 BSE, you don't deliver the water, so the risk is on me, since I deliver first


[29-May-22 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	OK, so the deal sounds like it's OK, but just keep in mind that a contract which is an "F" is not a futures contract


[29-May-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	It's just how allocater is choosing to offer new players a deal


[29-May-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	A contract with "F" is able to be accepted by someone with an "F" rating or higher


[29-May-22 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Seems a bit dramatic to call him a liar over that


[29-May-22 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I would point out some things though:


[29-May-22 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	1. 12 BSE isn’t enough, you’d need MCG as well.


[29-May-22 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	2. The value of those BSE is likely far less than the market value of the actual water. 12 BSE can’t trade for more than 18,600 CIS, whereas H2O is regularly passing through this LM in the 20-25 range.


[29-May-22 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And that’s the absolute maximum price of the BSE, in practice you can get them for around 12–15,000


[29-May-22 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	So if you take the average water price and average BSE price, he’s offering to pay about half the value?


[29-May-22 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Unless i’ve miscalculated


[29-May-22 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Ovviously there is some value in not having to fly and pick up the fabs and MCG


[29-May-22 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	I calculated at BSE price of 1500 which comes to water at 18. But it is dropping to 1400, so = water at 17. MCG I add for free on top! Also open to supply the HB1 materials. Basically I brought everything for a full 35 RIG base but nowhere to build them xD


[29-May-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jun-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	it's fine, I will ship back the MCG from KW-602C, the base can not be build that fast anyway due to labor shortage

**Joekingdom**:	Anyone need anything shipped to Katoa, got about 300m/t free


[07-Jun-22 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Hello everyone. I have 16 MHL.CI1 coming available in 17 hours on Katoa and I'm selling them by silent auction. If you are interested, please direct message me your bid via COM or Discord. The winner is the person who offers the highest bid, but the final price will be the second highest bid received (So if you bid 1,000 but the next highest was 800, you win and pay 800). Bids are open for 36 hours from now.


[07-Jun-22 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Delivery to EW is free, but may take extra time.

[17-Jun-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I wouldn't personally..


[17-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	HYF are okay on EW, but I wouldn't do FRM


[17-Jun-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	+1 HYF, if you can find MHL

**SFScorpio**:	On my kinda low level with only 2 planets it still makes sense and is profitable, but will upgrade to HYF when I'm ready. You're totally right


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	HYF probably not so good for making RAT though?


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Better check


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	cost of NS, water etc


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	vs just buying RAT


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	huge cost of MHL


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	then ongoing repairs


[17-Jun-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	It produces faster than FRM and for less space. Guess it just depends on your needs and what you are willing to spend


[17-Jun-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	And if you have own MHL, NS ... with own NS and H2O  HYF are really good


[17-Jun-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	With EW H2O and producing my own NS, I really like HYFs which also frees up FRMs to only produce their unique outputs


[17-Jun-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	But it does have a very high cost


[17-Jun-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Only if you’re fully integrated though right?


[17-Jun-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	Yeah I would be second guessing it if I didnt already have the supporting production lines. And I know a reliable MHL supplier in Corp which helps a ton

**WhosRodrix**:	Does the governor of Etherwind [in this case Rwinner16] pay for the upkeep or pay others to give the mats needed for upkeep? Both?


[20-Jun-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	FIOC handles upkeep, barring weird situations where we screwed up logistics on our end (forgot some MCG in one instance last COGC I think?)


[20-Jun-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Well I made your work easier by contributing all the DW this round :)


[20-Jun-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	And I assume FIOC does it for free?


[20-Jun-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Yep.


[20-Jun-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	If you want to join EFIO (I see GTU has Kinza HQ, so maybe you don't), we have a HQ here on EW as well.


[20-Jun-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	10% production bonus--depends on what you need.


[20-Jun-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I considered it already, not sure though, since it's also nice to have that HQ bonus on Kinza, I will say though, I make probably a tenth of the money I make here over there.


[20-Jun-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	FIO corp covers all the CoGC from our internal productions. Most of the POPI upkeeps are contracted out and are paid for by what FIO sells externally from my DW productions here on-planet.


[20-Jun-22 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But yes, there have been a couple instances where I've had to ask for donations and/or buy CoGC stuff as my ships are unable to bring in the materials in a timely manner


[20-Jun-22 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That acutally reminds me. Thank you CaroKann and AdvancedMetalSystems for the donations. If you'd like to be reimbursed - throw up a sell ad for the expenses. I've dropped the PE, and the MCG is en-route, after a layover at KW-602c. ETA 30hrs.

[21-Jun-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	NA gift on LM. Don't know why I have some in my INV here (may be auto unload somewhen). Don't want to transport it, but for new player it's may be useful

**Rwinner16**:	oh, so totally didn't read this before grabbing..


[21-Jun-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	My base on Proxion is full (of mostly FRMs) and I don't have the permits or shipping capacity to pick up another planet so I put a few on Etherwind to make sure I don't fall behind on consumables


[21-Jun-22 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Personally, Saga swayed me on those old debates on the importance of fertility: as such, while its got the lowest Fertility, I think there are worse planets to be farming on than Etherwind (since at least you have access to a lot of water). Having said that, you'd definitely be better off doing other stuff here given the choice...


[21-Jun-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	"Water matters more than fertility" mostly applies to non-Etherwind planets :-D.  EW has the lowest fertility in the game...


[21-Jun-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(Either AJ-768a or Vallis would be my picks for the worst farming planets, although local demand might save Vallis due to the need for C.)


[21-Jun-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	A FRM on Etherwind seems like a waste, a few of HYFs would out perform a planet of FRMs.


[21-Jun-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Its certainly not a good farming planet. But it isn't the worst.


[21-Jun-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	From my calculations, Etherwind FRMs still turn a profit (due to how cheap water is to collect on it), it's just the profit margin isn't as great as other planets with better fertility + agri cogc


[21-Jun-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so I was willing to take a hit and pay the potential opportunity cost for the sake of convenience (at least until I have better shipping capacity)

**SFScorpio**:	Sorry, beeing late to the party again. Keep in mind the cost of setting up HYFs. Quite the investment. Reason I started with FRM is that it's still profitable (solo + definitely when going horizontal) and gives quite some runway to switch to HYF over time


[22-Jun-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SFScorpio**:	A single HYFs cost of MHL alone is >50k, will a FRM is extremely cheap to start with.

[25-Jul-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Just needs INS and SEA, could be worse


[25-Jul-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jul-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KarimTheGrim**:	Do you think it would be a good idea to set up a not-only-resource-extraction base on KW-688d? Pros: fast&cheap communication with Etherwind, where I have some chemistry going. Cons: INS&SEA for initial construction


[26-Jul-22 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Would be interesting to do processing there


[26-Jul-22 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jul-22 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	If you’re looking to upgrade ships in the coming future and wish to purchase SSC, drop me a line. I’ll be selling them for 250. I had listed 700 in advance of the update but they were just bought and re-listed by a scalper. Don’t pay 450/u, I can easily service what you need for upgrades.

**Rwinner16**:	Morning all. Quick glance at most recent POPR. IIRC, the Unemployment shown is a historical # of what we had going INTO this week. So the unemployment went from 14.9%, but we added a net 830 PIO. Looks that our current POPI levels have gotten a stable "minimum", where the happiness of the PIO's increases above 70% as the unemployment dips near 10%. With all the other unemployments remaining high, I don't see a need to add any additional/upgrade anything.


[03-Aug-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah that sounds about right, it seems to be at a stable equilibrium currently


[04-Aug-22 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i am gonna colonize kw-688d soonish. i think a can also contribute a lot towards a WAR and an LM if that's of interest. What do you people think?


[04-Aug-22 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	what're you gonna be doing there? I presume NS production


[04-Aug-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	if so, where's the N coming from, an existing producer? new producer? CX?


[04-Aug-22 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	might tell another SNF member there would be more need for N if you pull from a source that needs it and he can sell to, or if he's interested in selling some to you (if you're still looking for N import)

**Nicster**:	I will be landing on KW-688d tomorrow morning. i have all the fabs for WAR and LM with me. I am not sure thoug if i would need INS and SEA for these buildings. if yes i probably won't have enough with me

[08-Aug-22 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nicster**:	For those of you still figuring out if they should settle kw-688d. I will shortly build the ADM and CoGC and I also have a 2k STL ship in the system, that will be able to help with shipping.


[31-Aug-22 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I still think about to settle on 688e and build a COCG for agri to move all my HYFs to 688e. But have other projects running for next 3 weeks. May be I'll do it after. Just fyi upfront


[31-Aug-22 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	cool, thx for the update. we are also thinking about moving the HYFs to 688d, but i did prioritize 688d for the NS supply.


[31-Aug-22 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yeah, you should use 688d mainly with ChemCOCG for NS. Not interesting for me, because I have no problems to bring in my NS to EW on my standrd route, because flights towards EW have always enough space. But a separated planet with agri COCG in system would be a real advantage for me.

[31-Aug-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I would build HYF on 688d *if* it had an Ag CoGC. I will not build HYF on 688e, even if it has an Ag CoGC


[31-Aug-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	If people want a chem planet then there's other options which are far superior as NS is cheap to shop

[31-Aug-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	That being said, y'all will decide and I'll just watch from the side-lines and make my decision once the consensus speaks :)


[31-Aug-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	of course you're right. 688d would be much better for HYFs but only with AG COCG. But as long as it will be a ChemCOCG, it doesn't make sense for me to move my HYFs to 688d


[31-Aug-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	My ships towards EW are max 50% full, so it is easy to ship NS to EW


[31-Aug-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I agree with you xensored, but we're only two people so if others with to make it Chem CoGC then more power to them


[31-Aug-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Btw, Electronica is a water planet with Chem COGC


[31-Aug-22 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I will also watch what FIO decides to do with 688d. Then I'll make my decision.


[31-Aug-22 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Both planets need INS, so the only difference is MCG+SEA on one hand and AEF on the other. I have own AEF, that's why the difference isn't really big for me


[31-Aug-22 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	AEF is alot more expensive for me (and I think for most people) even though I have access to both


[31-Aug-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Yes, that's why an AG COCG on 688d would always be the better option, I totally agree on that


[31-Aug-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	We'll see what the decision of the people is.

**xensored**:	And water is needed for HYFs, maybe that's why DW is getting a shortage again. I reduced my DW production from nearly 3k/day to 1k/day because I need the water for HYFs. If other player do the same, there is a lot of DW missing

[15-Sep-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Afternoon all! Out of curiosity, do you guys feel that we need to max the WAR out on EW for more space? Right now everyone has access to fit up to 2k/2k; so the most common ship build is happy. With DW/H2O being the same mass/volume, I had assumed it was sufficient.


[15-Sep-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I'd say it' sufficient, since the exports will all either be 2k or 1k variation maximum ship.


[15-Sep-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Does any1 know by chance what happens when WAR hits level 10? Is there a way to increase max units per person, or max available units after that?


[15-Sep-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Maximum (player built) WAR level is 20, for 10 units per person - we just got that on Circe


[15-Sep-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	It's consistently 1 new unit per person every 2nd level, so easy to work with.


[15-Sep-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	do/did you guys have a level upgrade requirements chart anywhere?


[15-Sep-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That is something I'd like to do (gives every1 just about a free STO worth)


[15-Sep-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	It increases by the cost of the first WAR (24 BBH, 24 BDE etc) every 2nd level - the 20th level is 10x as expensive as the first. Overall the cost of going from level 1 to level 20 is 101x as much as the very first level, if that makes sense.


[15-Sep-22 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Level 1 & 2 have same costs, level 3 and 4 are 2x level 1. 5/6 3x of 1. Easy enough


[15-Sep-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	One exception is that levels 1, 2 and 3 are all the same cost, but after that the pattern is standard.

[04-Oct-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	@tooslider I can detail a ship to come and get it for Katoa at 10,000/500t


[04-Oct-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Up to 2,000t


[04-Oct-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you just have a single 500t load, I can do it for 8,000 (as I'd include it in among my own shipping)

[11-Oct-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-22 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Even in American English, "close" would never be used when the alternative was "reject", you accept/reject terms to close a deal.

**jelutz77**:	I know the term Close is used profusely in real estate, though I don't think they use an opposite term, but I suppose reject may be an opposite.


[12-Oct-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Though with real estate, closing is more about fulfillment of the contract, not the agreement of it.


[12-Oct-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	But yes, closing a deal, vs. not closing, I suppose.


[12-Oct-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yes it is used all over, to describe the process of "closing" the deal - but it's not the final step. Like where it's used in this contract process, you have the contract come in, you accept or reject terms, exchange goods and payments and the deal is closed


[12-Oct-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's usage where it is, in the UI, is wrong


[12-Oct-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	because when you click the button, you haven't actually closed the deal at all


[12-Oct-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	no payment or goods are exchanged


[12-Oct-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and in fact, the deal remains open


[12-Oct-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	o_O


[12-Oct-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tooslider**:	I mis read it constantly cant argue that :)


[13-Oct-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Close = Agree to terms


[13-Oct-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	It just so happens the majority of the time (such as in "closing on a house") also involves settling the terms of the closed contract shortly after.

**NorseFTX**:	Oh dang I don't have PE on hand to fill the CoGC. Moving forward i might keep some on hand just in case though, hopefully someone can fill it x:

**Rwinner16**:	So sorry guys-I imported 10k days ago but flat forgot that it was needed. I've restored it, and my refill batch of MCG is 2d out.


[07-Mar-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh nice, that was quick! Sounds good. I also keep everything except PE here so if i stock some PE as well I can help for anything in case of a shortage.

**Rwinner16**:	Howdy all. I'm going to be working towards 1-2 EMC's for Etherwind. Plan is to get a bit more safety, to keep the PIO buffer up, while also able to lower the effective level of the INF's to keep Health from going too high.


[22-Mar-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Sharlindra**:	also INC here might make sense? no? its also res extraction


[18-May-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Maybe, if you can find ir make a nearby agriculture base to supply it.


[18-May-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	Can confirm INCs work fine here. I have a base w 20 of them constantly billowing black smoke over the neighboring plots. Importing crops from Nemesis and Proxion


[18-May-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	FIO does FPs, HYFs, RIGs here. INCS probably would work well here as well since we have HYFs.

[25-May-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-May-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	They need to finish more things on the road map before they can go public with the game, meaning money for them. If that's stalling out before going public, that's a bad thing.


[26-May-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	The things that have the most impact also take the longest to develop - sometimes, if you're only hearing about small stuff it's because in the background some big item is being worked on continuously.


[26-May-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Though I don't know specifically in this case.


[26-May-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	We can hope they're working on something significant, but normally they come out with updates in the devlog. The only thing there for 3 months has been the leaderboard.


[26-May-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SpaceWolf_**:	does anyone know what happens if my current pioneers goes over the current one and capacity?


[25-Jun-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you don't have enough workers then your efficiency suffers and producrion slows


[25-Jun-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceWolf_**:	oh okay but I can still build buildings right?


[25-Jun-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Yep, build away, you just get lower productivity.


[25-Jun-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	And to be clear, efficiency drops off proportionally.  If you need 200 workers but only have housing for 100 of them, then your production lines run at 50% efficiency.

[12-Jul-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@Roleneshelton: If it's SIO or H2O, you build a EXT or RIG (respectively).  If you need other materials, you need to purchase them from the nearest CX.  For Etherwind, we're halfway between BEN and ANT.  So either of those.  Maybe BEN is slightly closer.


[12-Jul-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-23 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariul**:	like 90% of my logistic requests are for things i cant even make, buying and shipping them is a much bigger loss than a survey, i dont have many chances to get rep anymore :(

**Kaiser_Beans**:	Hey, new to the game and system. Any tips to get started?


[06-Sep-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	@Kaiser_Beans go through the tutorial if you haven't yet. here on Etherwind, production of DW is probably the best start, though selling raw H2O or O would work too. try to avoid flying empty and save your fuel. the game is pretty slow at the beginning


[06-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaiser_Beans**:	Thanks I appreciate the tips.


[06-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaiser_Beans**:	Water is definitely the easiest resource to get started with, but should I make my own food or buy from others? Soil here is fertile enough to be self sufficient I believe, at least at the start.


[06-Sep-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	normally, I'd suggest buying, but RAT prices have been high recently. with PRO, you could talk to other players and try to make a better deal, but without it you're limited to CX prices


[06-Sep-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it's up to you, but I'd focus on expanding DW production first; if you want to make RATs, consider using HYFs instead of FRMs; they use more water but on Etherwind it's not a problem. they're expensive to build though


[06-Sep-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	Etherwind fertility is... not great. but HYFsdon't use fertility

[07-Sep-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	they only make sense when base permits start to be an issue and you want volume instead of margins


[07-Sep-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	yep. margins are great for minimizing quarterly capital costs, while maximizing potential revenues, although at a certain point, the extra 2-5k daily revenues that I've noted from HYF/FRM projections start to make sense over a long span of time, provided you have your inputs sourced.

[01-Nov-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	if ya'll know someone willing to potentially do a dedicated POPI source, LMK. It's guaranteed steady cashflow as long as I'm gov.

[01-Nov-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Example : BND needs 600/30 days recurring: or any variation thereof. Just donate to the POPI and send me a bill, or send me a sell for the BNDs and I fill. At whatever agreed upon rate we come to.


[01-Nov-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	two ways:


[09-Nov-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	through the PLI command you can access the Chamber of Global Commerce which is a program that boosts some aspect of this planet.  Here we're doing Resource Extraction.  You can contribute there.


[09-Nov-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Alternatively, you can also help maintain the population infrastructure for which rwinner will pay you


[09-Nov-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	just open the POPI panel for the planet and pick one of the ones missing upkeep and donate


[09-Nov-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekeMorrin**:	thanks Yeyland-Wutani!


[09-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekeMorrin**:	ok I saw both now


[09-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekeMorrin**:	I saw a very interesting product while taking a look at those donatable items. It's called Entertainment Data Core EDC and require no input to be produced. Only some infrastructures are requiring it and only NPC faction is buying them atm across all station which is 13k per item. It is requiring Software Engineering building and engineers (duuh!) I wonder if it would be profitable to produce it, probably not.

[09-Nov-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Revenchrist**:	Good day everyone. Can somebody share what's the basic daily oxygen production on this planet? Thank you very much in advance!


[11-Nov-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The planet currently has production boost from CoGC - Resource Extraction but I have a collector running at 89%. So the line production is 94%. So, with no experts the production is 118% - 7 units in 5h 16m. I usually run with 5 experts for a production rate of 152% - 7 units 4h 6m.


[11-Nov-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Looking over the most recent POPR now. I haven't had to look into much of the higher tier POP levels before, so I'm heading on over to POPI refreshers. First guess though is that I'm overshooting my settler's via health, but my techs won't come naturally because of the comfort.


[16-Nov-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have all pieces but the HABs to max out the PAR to level 10. The HABs are all under contract and currently on the production line. I'm hopeful that it'll be done in the coming weeks.

[17-Nov-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Aries: Sorry, i picked up all the packages when I came in earlier


[17-Nov-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I noticed xD


[17-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If I don't get any I'm not worried about it.


[17-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Why don't you go do something else with that ship and let me handle the packages ?


[17-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I heard Moria is great this time of year


[17-Nov-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You're normally flying my packages lol I accidentally "unload on arrival" yesterday with some mats I want at the CX so I made a special trip


[17-Nov-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i know :P


[17-Nov-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and I like your business :P


[17-Nov-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	This is why I pay someone else to send goods xDDD Dumba** like me has a habit of pushing wrong buttons


[17-Nov-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	why do you think I'm always doing back and forth?  :D  cause I always forget BTAs or MCGs


[17-Nov-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	lol I always forget OVE


[17-Nov-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh and C


[17-Nov-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I seen that lol I thought about passive aggressively pushing a few ether-> cx routes xDDD jkjk


[17-Nov-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	lol


[17-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I definitely would if it didn't screw up my routine


[17-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I think that is just a guarantee all the time


[17-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I need more ships lol


[17-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	yea, know that desire


[17-Nov-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	6 bases, 2 ships. I try to only fly between 3 and outsource the other 3


[17-Nov-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Soon to be 7 bases xD


[17-Nov-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	aaaah, the halcyon days of 6 bases .. it seems like only a couple weeks ago..


[17-Nov-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Right feels like every time we talk you add another


[17-Nov-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'm hoping to open up shop on Geidi in the coming weeks


[17-Nov-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	actually it was only a couple weeks ago I had 6 bases lol


[17-Nov-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Probably JS-601e as well which makes me want to open up a couple more bases :facepalm:


[17-Nov-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	well. putting expansion on hold till I get another ship...


[17-Nov-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	lol


[17-Nov-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It's like an endless cycle. If I setup the new JS base, I'll need to open up 2 more bases for H and AMM. Geidi will just add to my ship building venture


[17-Nov-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, i'm starting to scope out my 7th base too


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	still okay with 2 ships, but my spreadsheet is getting unwieldy


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Yeyland how often do you visit the RC-040 district?


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Never.  Why ?


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	My closest point is Uponor


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	XH329 - two jumps away


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	My ads usually sit there for a week at a time before I say screw it and send a ship that way xDD


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Problem is I only need shipping from RC-040c->d and that's it


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I have a strict policy of no inter-system flights :P


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	This is why I need a 3rd ship xDD Something to just throw out there and forget about


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	The only time I do inner-system flights is when I just pass-by


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and with that big a system no one picks up the gear ?


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nope xD I mean it's fine. I just take a wcb ship out there once a week and restock my essentials at both bases so it's not really a big deal just annoying


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	my bases are all arrenged in a circle, soon I'll complete the loop and one ship will do clockwise and the other counterclockwise


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That'd be pretty sweet


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you can always relocate :D


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	lol that's not an option xD


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That'd be way to much work and it's only used for SOI production. I only export about 5% for personal use


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	damn


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	most expensive dirt factory in the universe


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Very xD But decently profitable tbh. I give good discount for those that are willing to pickup at the manufacturer


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	No shipping out of system required :)


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	are you trying to coax me into going there :P


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	lol naaah I'll be fine. I might just go ahead and get a 3rd ship before expanding more bases


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh you mean moving there?? xDD Absolutely not!! loool


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	nah, coaxing me into doing runs there to get your soil


[17-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	speaking of being an idiot and forgetting stuff:  i forgot to offload my flux, oxygen and carbon for my smelting on Giedi Prime

[03-Dec-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	a lot of people seem to aim at about 10 per ton. adjust up a little per jump. also have a look at the BEN/Moira prices people are putting up as a guide


[03-Dec-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**JamesHart**:	getting others to ship is not cheap, until you compare it to the price of a new ship lol


[03-Dec-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Or you can look at other Ben LM ads and post for the same but they may sit for awhile


[03-Dec-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	6 systems no other cargo able to be carried. hate to say it but that isnt bad


[03-Dec-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I can go 10k CIS for 1k O if it's from Ben CX. But if it's from Etherwind I can't do less than 15k for 1k O


[03-Dec-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	yeah i already spent 300k towards a new ship and thats just 2 items lol slowly working on it using my O profits to pay for a new ship


[03-Dec-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	New ships are expensive lol


[03-Dec-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If interested in my pricing feel free to send a contract. From Ben I can be there in a day at 10k CIS. 2 days from Etherwind for 15k CIS


[03-Dec-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	yeah i think ill take you up on that


[03-Dec-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	The POPI builds are a dual edged sword, and require a bit of a balancing act.


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Say a level 1 POPI building provides a (making all this up for simplicity); 100 bonus to safety per input item. A level 2 would provide 200 per input item, level 3 - 300. The weekly burn rate on each input also scales. So the questions then are; how much bonus do you need, and which is better; a lower level with more inputs, or a higher level with less inputs


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have always gone with the philosophy of trying to have the building at a higher level to use lesser inputs; the POPI system allows the GOV to "Downgrade" the effective level of the building to meet needs. So even if it's over-leveled, it can be adjusted to meet changing needs

[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I'm mainly having the UNI as it's one of the only POPI buildings that provides a passive bonus to the levels; no inputs necessary

**Rwinner16**:	it isn't a bunch, but it also helps future proof any potentiality; no matter how unlikely (EW has huge PIO demand, and mainly PIO usages)

**Rwinner16**:	ran this POPR with no program to get a better baseline on where we stand. looks like overall, we're beyond healthy #'s across the board. We're at almost 40% comfort with just 1 input in the PAR. We're sitting pretty well off if we ever need to start focusing on higher-tier pop

**Toomas84**:	theres nothing worth to trade


[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Toomas84**:	for constructor things you can make are doable only if you produce evrything for your pioneers


[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Toomas84**:	Mineral Construction Granulate if  you buy limestone from market 1 unit is like 4 mcg


[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Toomas84**:	its 4 times cheaper than 1 unit of limestone


[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Ah I see, I only know about RIGs :p Sucks to hear that constructors are having a rough time


[02-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Is BSE / BBH etc not profitable at all anymore?


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Quite the opposite; Check ANT CX Pricing


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	BSE as been at essentially max MM price for a couple months or more.


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yeah I didn't understand what that guy was saying at all.


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Each MCG run also produces 50 MCG


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	@Toomas84 I can only recommend you to double check your numbers on constructor. With prices for BSE basically stuck as high as they can get I would think it is profitable.


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Seeing you are still a new player maybe you want to restart (COLIQ) and pick a planet more suitable for construction like Gibson. This will give you a 25% boost from the chamber of global commerce (CoGC) to your production buildings


[02-Jan-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Etherwind is really not the best planet to do construction.

[03-Jan-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	some of the h2o orders are people who are planing to sell it on the cx and if h2o prices are runing at 23-27 20 cis isnt that low and prices could fall quickly if a few poeple deside to market make at 30

[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	do you mean building for your base, or population infrastructure ?


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	whats the difference between these 2?


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	i just joined the game like 10 minutes ago


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, just realized that.  Forget about the population infrastructure.  Have you unloaded the content of your ship in your base storage?


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	my ship storage is the one at the bottom right?


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	and the one above is the base inventory


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i don't remember the layout when starting.  I heavily modified my interface.


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	but the ship storage normally has a button that says 'unload' when it's docked


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	below the system map tile i have two tiles with AVI


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	when you build new buildings for a base it needs to be in the base storage


[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**mighty.pelican**:	i built HB1 right now as a first buidling


[14-Jan-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Etherwind is a planet where water extraction (and processing) is really good.


[14-Jan-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Also, it's rather far from the Commodity Exchange (Benten Station)


[14-Jan-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	so you're looking at a rather hard start


[14-Jan-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	aight thats good for a first game haha


[14-Jan-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, i suggest you figure out base mechanics, and when you feel better... you start a new company with the 'coliq' command


[14-Jan-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	if you want to work construction Gibson might be a better planet


[14-Jan-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	alright ill try to get into it


[14-Jan-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	so it sall about build up base trade produce


[14-Jan-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah


[14-Jan-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	then expand to the stars


[14-Jan-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	start other base, build logistics and production networks, balance everything, find other players to ally with


[14-Jan-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	i normally like games with like less casual focus and more the grind and day long actions and stuff but why is everything in 3 word shortcuts haha


[14-Jan-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	FLT BS SCRNS


[14-Jan-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I have no idea... but it's a german game company where you build your empire of trade... you know... the same country that build SAP...


[14-Jan-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	SAP?


[14-Jan-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	one of the bigest business management software suite in the world.


[14-Jan-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Each function in the software is tied to a transaction name that is an abbreviation.  it was a joke


[14-Jan-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	hahahahaha


[14-Jan-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	but fr they gotta change the layout


[14-Jan-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	nah, layout is great.  The learning curve is what's great


[14-Jan-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you can customize all your panels


[14-Jan-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	learning curve = hard


[14-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	after a while you'll be able to work magic with the layout


[14-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	yea i started a production line


[14-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	good job !

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	that's the spirit


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	next stop is filling the queue line to produce more :P


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	aight haha


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	it tells me im missing materials form everything but i built HB1 2 times, BMP and PP1


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	is that good?


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the HBs are the habitat to host your population


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the BMP will produce multiple types of stuff.  The MCG is a good start - but it's basically hauling concrete.


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	There's probably a synergy between what is required to manufacturs B-fabs (basic prefabricated) and MCG ;)


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mighty.pelican**:	alright


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	The PP1 will be able to produce B-Fabs


[14-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	which are in turn either sold, or used to expand your base

**neke86**:	I'd like to help, I fly out of here a lot, but at 10 CIS/m3 it's too low margin to offset carrying my own high-margin goods sorry

**Rwinner16**:	The unemployment on PIO seems low, but if I'm doing the numbers right, it's still equaling out to 11.6k free for use. If it drops much lower, I'll look at fully filling the SST to give a 30d boost

**Aahz**:	Well your base is probably in disrepair so you probably need to fix that and get some consumables so your workers are productive again.


[22-Mar-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	and ships are quite expensive, but you get them by getting all the parts, then starting a shipbuilding project on any planet with a shipyard. assign all the parts to the project and it'll build a ship. Note that a PRO license is required for that, and the parts can total 3-6 million for a new ship

[01-Jun-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jun-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Just lemme know if any of you guys need exports


[01-Jun-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Competitive rates vary, and it's usually reflected in how urgent/how many contracts are posted at the LM on an interday basis. Most decent payloads for a 500t/m3 ship run around like 7k between CXs, but they're picked up rather fast (especially when players are running around with 2k t/m3s around like they're the next best thing.


[01-Jun-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	KW-688 <--> BEN is like 8-10k for a round-trip flight, on just fuel/depreciation costs for a 2k t/m3. Anything else is up to the involved parties, but if people are keeping unsused ships, sitting somewhere, they'll usually go to where the higher rates are, so proffer accordingly. :)

[01-Jun-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jun-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Oh yes, I've noticed, and I'd like to emulate this model elsewhere, rather soon.


[01-Jun-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But just as a note to anyone who's looking at this, the LM markets for shipping on planets is basically an inverse market @ public [ whomever needs stuff shipped now lists at their highest possible rate]. At the CX its the exact opposite, since there's just so many shippers crossing over on a daily basis. Low-ball shipping ads are just not worth it, as you're wasting more SF fuel, and time, for pennies on the dollar. If you've got a dependable, and capable shipper @Rwinner16, chat them up and see if they can service you.


[01-Jun-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I've had to deal with crummy shipping ads within my first 60 days, so I'm biased with wanting to offer a better experience to others. :P


[01-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Imagine like 500 ICA for 500 t/m3, going from Promitor to Avalon. I had to waste much more fuel, than it was worth, just to service such contracts.


[01-Jun-24 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	As a shipper the worst is when people don't auto-provision.  It should either be the default or there should be a way to see on a shipping contract if it has been set.


[01-Jun-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah its a little finicky there, let me elaborate.


[01-Jun-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People may not auto-provision, for either pirate watch, or mistake. The mistakes happen when they issues ads, at the same LM, for either different Origins, or Destinations. The GUI window has a little function in that it defaults auto-provision settings to null, should either the O/D change. It's hard to spot it due to the font colors, so its an easy mistake if you're in a rush.


[01-Jun-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If they do it intentionally for pirate-watch, maybe they should just issue them as A-ratings, instead of P-ratings, and/or, maybe should the contractee/shipper pick them up at like 12 hours in advance, so that the contractor can do their thing.


[01-Jun-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's a tough sell, since they're just UX issues, which haven't been touch upon due to priorities, but there is things that you as the shipper can do to help to fix em.


[01-Jun-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, I get the pirate watch and wanting to be careful.  As a shipper I almost always grab shipments right before i'm about to leave a place so if they aren't auto provisioned it is a huge pain since I either have to pause my whole ship for hours or days waiting for someone to provision.  This is why I suggested having an indication if a contract will auto provision so I can just skip the ones that aren't or grab a day or something ahead of time (which I wouldn't normally do).

***lemongames** left.*


[01-Jun-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The few times they aren't auto-provisioned I send a term request. If they provision and refuse the termination I let it expire and take the hit.


[01-Jun-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah. I've suggested in places that those wanting to tender good jobs for those willing, just offer good rates with A-rating, with 3-5 days in staged deadlines. But you won't get immaculate service with public issued contracts. You're better off with hooking up with the private services, and just issuing stuff 1-2 days in advance, so it all gets provisioned well-ahead of arrival.

[03-Jun-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Im willing to pay the fair pricing, as these items aren't typically hugely demanded and profits have historically been less than counterpart items. I want yall to not be "settling" on profits. If that makes sense.

**Rwinner16**:	I have not had time to run #s on how this new government update will affect things. I'm hoping that since we've got excellent POPI base levels, and are mainly a PIO planet that it won't affect us much.


[24-Jun-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The only WAY left field issue I can forsee is that this update takes away control from thr gov and towards a parliamentary style. Any collective could theoretically all run and overrule our longstanding principles of no taxation. I'm extremely doubtful that this planet or PRUN player base engages in that tactic, but it is a possibility.


[25-Jun-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Kind of wish it was an optional step, like where I'm the only base on a planet I should automatically have a level of power, then the governor is good for smaller planets (though I like the planet having its own bank account) and then for those with lots of bases in action it makes sense to be more democratic.


[25-Jun-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Rwinner16 - after the politics update, you can plainly state your intentions / direction for the planet and encourage others that agree with you to run for parliament to help maintain the status quo :p


[25-Jun-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jun-24 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hopefully the politics update will inclucde the focus split for SCRNs, since it's rather hard for me to even plug-another screen, just to keep tabs on everyone's POPI + election cycles.


[25-Jun-24 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm not going to go through like 100 more clicks, on my daily rounds, just to check whether the vote is in progress, or not. Looking at the voting tendencies on other worlds, this is pretty much the case that few have their eyes on elections, since most are pretty much resulting in the incumbant always winning.


[25-Jun-24 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That being said, if you want to maintain the collective on Etherwind, you'll have to get everyone who's interested awares of the election, and vote on it when it comes to pass.


[25-Jun-24 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Looking at the POPR, we'll likely have a 3, or 5, seat parliament, so there will be room for interlopers to step in, rather easily if they have a fan-base around.

[26-Jun-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I think the parliament size is determined by the number of winning electees? Although I'm not terribly clear on this.


[26-Jun-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It's based off the amount of bases on a planet, though I suppose if not enough people run in the election, that'd also make sense


[26-Jun-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	From the devlog: The way it works right now is that if the potential parliament size is 3 or 5 and there are not enough candidates then the parliament size is reduced to the next smaller size. E.g. in a 5 seat parliament with 4 candidates there will be three members of parliament.


[26-Jun-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	So if only Rwinner runs, I assume there'd be a parliament of 1. But there's not a great way to make sure that we don't get 2 random people that vote for themselves


[26-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think it's likely that on any planet that qualifies for a size 5 parliament, will probably be easily able to fill them


[26-Jun-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Well, to be fair, putting yourself forwards to spend a lot of time doing politics is signing up for a bit of work.


[26-Jun-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	All accounts show 0 CIS on-hand. Currently I don't see much of a need to transfer any goods, conts, or cash, into the GOV account. I'll re-evaluate if/when we need more POPI programs. If you see any MOTS come across for EW; that's what it's for.

[03-Jul-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	Shrew, do you accept AIC?


[03-Jul-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Any currency is accepted


[03-Jul-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	I'm based in ANT so AIC is even prefered. If you have other bases in ANT, i can also deliver there


[03-Jul-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	if you have extra cargo space, I'd be happy if you can take some cargo to ANT.  I'll take it from there

[03-Jul-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	Would you be willing to ship to Romulus?


[03-Jul-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	@Shrew, the election on Romulus will end in 12 hrs.  Then I can lower that rental fee.  There is a cheaper warehouse presently on A.  Another player controls that


[03-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	I would need cheaper warehousing and at the very least 2 warehouses. But then i would happily include this planet


[03-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah I can't wait to see the wild market for whatever materials are needed for it. KAWA will definitely be trying to build some on the planets we take care of but it's gonna get real expensive I imagine


[15-Jul-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jul-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jul-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have no problem expanding out to all our needs. Once we get more details on needs and recurring costs, we can get a realistic idea of scope potential.


[16-Jul-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Also depends on if both planets require one. If so, the outpost planets like Pyrgos, we'd need to collab and help Jumpstart theirs. Also, will one jump gate in EW handle all destinations, or one per?


[16-Jul-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	By the wording, my impression was you'd need one gate per destination.


[16-Jul-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	If a destination can be added/removed quickly, you could have the nightmare admin job of alternating between destinations.


[16-Jul-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	we might find we need 1 for all the close planets and 1 for each of the far out planets


[16-Jul-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	the log mentioned 'upgrades' for gateways that allow them to connect to further out planets, and also that it is one gateway per destination, the 2 work as a pair that only connect to each other


[16-Jul-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I thought it would be cool if they had a traffic queue system and upgrades would let them do more frequent jumps or larger ships, but I didn't see any sign of that.

[17-Jul-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The gateway projects will be controlled by the planetary governments that each gate will get situated on. I wouldn't be surprised if those useless planets, in each system, get some attention, to simply install/maintain the gateway.


[17-Jul-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People would likely jump on installing Inter-CX gateways on the inner worlds first, followed by extremely popular (and shipping intensive) routes on whatever's left, ending ultimately in the leftovers for Hubur/Arclight?


[17-Jul-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However.... if the gateways do your ship's FTL work, for you..... That infers the possibility of STL shipping dominance, on a well-built, and maintained network. Maybe; who knows? Since the gateways will have to be maintained, they will also be charging fees per use, so it might not be worthwhile, in comparison to our current schema, in the end.


[17-Jul-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	unless it's that prohibitively expensive, I can't see a reason why we'd chanrge on our end. I am very curious as to why we'd need a gateway per end destination; seems obscurely dumb. If we (humanity) is smart enough for gate tech, you think we'd be smart enough to choose the destination end point (Think Stargate)


[17-Jul-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd imagine it to be near instantaneous FTL travel, via gateway. And the one-way routing is easier to incorporate through their new politics system, since you wouldn't be able to easily manage a 2-planet gateway, with two different governments. If its prohibitively expensive? We'll see. It'll be a good opportunity to boost market utilization on certain product categories (I'm thinking r-fabs, and maybe some niche welding items + loads of electronics and FTL stuff).


[17-Jul-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I mean more like why we'd need 20 gateways floating in orbit around Etherwind - each one tied to one specific destination. Seems easier to have 1, but require upgrades to unlock additional destinations


[17-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	iirc, you'll get 1 per planet, single-way.


[17-Jul-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	so we'll have to be very sure of what/where we want it to go? Seems like we'll need to have conversations with sister planets if we want to ring them together


[17-Jul-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yep. But, the "rings" will largely be determined by COGC flows, and CX paths, limited with how many ADM goverments you can prop up in a single system (with each planet/gov yielding 1 gateway?).


[17-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So, from the dev log, the draft of what's coming basically involves some tough decisions, but they'll largely get determined by the active voting blocks in each system, followed by LR fee changes, followed by whomever is willing to provide such project materials at discount, or changes in CX market fluctuations.


[17-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	once the destination point is set, can it be changed later on? (Change in gov votes) Or is it hardset forever


[17-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That would be interesting, but you'll get more details in more dev logs.


[17-Jul-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Assuming you want something like what was proposed, you'll want to grow a liquidity base from now on. The first opportunity will be given to whomever reads the dev log updates, and hence be able to act on CX offering immediately, since the rates will likely change within 12-24 hours of its posting, as people have their spreadsheets.


[17-Jul-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It'll be a huge smash-and-grab during the first days, afterwards a market re-tooling will take about ~45 days, when people make their actual production decisions, if they haven't already accumulated massive stockpiles, but seeing though as it'll be a potentially random material pick from the devs on their infrastructure choices, some may win, and others may lose.

**lowstrife**:	holy shit 1.5 to 2.5 million my bad I put that into the wrong planet chat


[18-Sep-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	this is etherwind


[18-Sep-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the numbers are lower than that


[18-Sep-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I don't see a reason why you can't reduce the spend of popi to about 1\3rd where it is


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fest3 program with no popi spend will cause net migration inward so it's not even needed every week


[18-Sep-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's generally worth less than 2 POPI upkeeps.


[18-Sep-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	best for the PMs/Gov to decide which to defund, if ever.


[18-Sep-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	KW-688c's been a private buildup, ever since --- ever.... so you're talking to the wall, lest the wall would like to grow even higher. :P


[18-Sep-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	We're FIO :). We use our cash to support local business. Private CONTS to feed POPI upkeeps keeps business booming and spreads the wealth.


[18-Sep-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	@Rwinner16 yeah, welcome to the club. PM motions have at most a 24 hour timer, for afks. Each GOV term is 28 days. Each election period starts 8 days before term end. Each LR Target/Fee adjustment takes effect upon the next POPR report, and each POPR program takes effect instantaneously, when it is fully paid for/started.


[16-Oct-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I think both Plato and Aristotle denoted forms of democracy, as being the irregular forms of government. In Prun, we have at least two. Tyrrany of the devs imposing metrics and mechanics, and some sort of popular vote, which leaves much to do, and much to be figured out.


[16-Oct-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The former is what you get, when you engage in some activity/game, whose rule-set is imposed by a third party, without your discretion. (Most people find out the game mechanics eventually, and not immediately before spooling up the game/account instance).


[16-Oct-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The latter is what you're seeing now. Chaos everywhere, no common guidance, no common metrics, just whatever, everywhere, to the best of everyone's discretion. I'm fighting up-hill battles in places.. Others are doing the same. So are you apparently, from our recent tussle on #UFO.


[16-Oct-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fluffy2001**:	Hello everyone,  does anyone know Cara2010? They are doing business as Koala. they picked up 2500 units of water and then canceled the contract. I have been sending them a personal contract for refunding the water.  But they keep refusing.


[01-Nov-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm not sure what you mean. Both parties have to terminate the contract for it to terminate


[01-Nov-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	yes, I agreed to the termination thinking they could not deliver in time. then send a contract to buy back thr water they collected.


[01-Nov-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	I was just hoping they may read the common chat in case their refusal was accidental.


[01-Nov-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If they scammed H2O out of you that's pretty crappy


[01-Nov-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If you don't get the H2O back just send me a message I'll send you 2500 H2O


[01-Nov-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	I appreciate. this is not going to ruin me, just annoying.

**Fluffy2001**:	still waiting for a water refund for picked up water but never delivered. 6 days now. that Company has picked up another 4 shipments since.


[03-Nov-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	Company: Koala


[03-Nov-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That company sounds familiar


[03-Nov-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	what is the username?


[03-Nov-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	glad that we can block people and still see the market


[03-Nov-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	when they try to accept it, they get a game message that says "the poster of this ad has blocked you, you cannot accept this ad" - or something to that effect


[03-Nov-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I only know this because someone actually blocked me....


[03-Nov-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	I will try the blocking thing. I just wanted to say something or I would feel like I did not do enough. no problem regarding the water, but thank you!

New Etherwind Law Requires Voters to Show FIOC ID
ETHERWIND, KW-688 - In what officials are calling “completely necessary step for securing democratic integrity of planetary elections, comrade,” Etherwind’s governing body passed new legislation requiring all voting CEOs to present FIOC-issued identification cards during upcoming planetary elections.

**OptimizedFunction**:	*Marches 2160 Pioneers to ADM, demanding equitable voting rights*


[11-Nov-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Amusing. Though the tax claim is a bit lame in that the lack of taxes is a key aspect of the Etherwind Way.


[11-Nov-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	*Threatens to flood the ADM with H2O if demands not met in 24 hours*


[11-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	I can see that


[11-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	very accurate and truthful

**VerdeV**:	Just disappointed I missed out on being part of the supply chain!


[11-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Guess I can contribute some OFF to help with the processing of OptimizedFunction.


[11-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	I don't support this law. Me and all my workforce is in protest and will flood the ADM in 23 hours 58 minutes if the demand of revoking the law is not met.


[11-Nov-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	Mind you, I have an army of 2160 PIO :)


[11-Nov-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Giving away lots of free H2O just sounds like you should join EFIO!


[11-Nov-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Papi2Caca**:	Can our non-FIOC identification cards be used to vote, as long as they're only used to vote for FIOC approved candidates?


[15-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	No... Only FIOC approved identification cards can be used to verify an affirmative ballot, for a FIOC candidate... However that speaks nothing of non-FIOC candidates, so feel free to vote for KAWA.


[15-Nov-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	One thing I don't understand is the UNI. I've always been told it provides a passive bonus. Is that to EDU only? Since I don't have any culture going, I don't see it?


[15-Nov-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah its an education rate modifier.


[15-Nov-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	so hop on to pct.fnar.net


[15-Nov-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	go to Workforce?


[15-Nov-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	scroll down... Plug in the next tier happiness, and previous tier population, and you get the education rate for the next POPR.


[15-Nov-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Given current PBH | LIB | UNI levels.


[15-Nov-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	excuse me... POPULATION Infrastructure.


[15-Nov-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	How this applies? Well hop on to YI-715b POPR report... we're pretty similar yes?


[15-Nov-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Since you guys have got a FULL x10 UNIs here... Your weekly education rates are double that of Verdant.


[15-Nov-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Btw, you basically paid for that benefit, with like 100 mil CIS.


[15-Nov-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	or someone else did.


[15-Nov-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Verdant gets like 80 SET --> TEC per POPR... Since Etherwind has 10 UNIs, you guys get x2 that amount.


[15-Nov-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's just a passive bonus, no POPI needed.


[15-Nov-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh wait, you guys run POPI... fawk.....

**Nicster**:	After a long hiatus i came back to the game and decided to start a little loan service as well. The Benten is the BEST New Player Loan program offers already a lot, but i would like to help players even after that.   My offering is the following:  Stable and Interest Loans 3% interest rate 3 - 8 weeks duration min. Loan 200k max Loan (negoatiable, depending on expansion plan and currently available funds on my side)  If you are interested you can drop me an ingame message (CO STMI) and we can discuss ticket size and duration.  see also ⁠galactic-deals on the UFO discrod for a little more information.

**atlantisrising169**:	Also @Rwinner16 about the only thing more i could ask out of this planet is have ships/people who will consistently do shipping orders. I cake here with onpy my 2 starter ships, and i have a hard time moving 400+T/d and also taking care of other bases. Ik this falls outside of regular governed handling, but that's all i could need from this planet at this point


[31-Dec-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@atlantisrising169 post LM shipping conts @ BEN, to service your needs at KW-688c., at a price range between 5k CIS --> 8k CIS, per 500 t/m3.


[31-Dec-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you keep having issues, just ask in this planetary chat if anyone has any ship available for your jobs.


[31-Dec-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	TLDR: Shipping is not a GOV duty, unless the governor or an MP is asking for it. Else you have to contract out.

**VerdeV**:	Can we set the university down to perhaps level 2? I'm planning on experimenting with a SL and will supply some TUB for the POPI but 1000/3 days seems like a lot more than it should need.


[21-Jan-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	albeit I'm sure at a lower rate


[21-Jan-25 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	For creating Sci, yep, but we've no Education need fulfillment, so they'll leave fast if Happiness stays really low.


[21-Jan-25 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	fair point (tbh, I'm all PIO/SET, so unless I'm governing the planet don't pay too much attention to the popi)


[21-Jan-25 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Might even be better off with 1 level of Art Cafe since comfort and culture have a good impact at the high end.


[21-Jan-25 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**realbandit**:	Lowering the UNI level will also reduce the passive education rate


[21-Jan-25 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	HD is also the cheapest upkeep for the UNI, ~1/2 the cost of TUB. HD is better even when buying HD from offer and TUB at bid.


[21-Jan-25 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Also @VerdeV, if you're just looking for a single SL here, once you create open jobs you'll likely get all the SCI in 1 go (With 10 UNI running) no need for any edu upkeep


[21-Jan-25 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I'd guess the passive education rate might be enough to sustain a small population of SCI without any changes needed

[25-Jan-25 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	what maths are you looking at thats wrong?


[25-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your edits? Of course?


[25-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	where/what are you talking about?


[25-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can play dumb, but you've been doing so for about a year.


[25-Jan-25 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have no earthly idea what you're talking about. I'm not doing any maths on anything POPI related.


[25-Jan-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I have old data... From about 2 years ago. There's arbitrary edits on pct.fnar.net that "get edited" whenever you ask your "questions" on APEX chats. Of course, there's no maths, or statistics backing up any edits whatsoever. So... You boys can play your thing...


[25-Jan-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Whereas I'll grab the data, and do the regressions myself. Yeah, I've got 98% fidelity up to lv 100 HQ info.


[25-Jan-25 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	lol. I've got no data/programming ability and have no ties to whomever does fnar.net stuff. I know the people who do, but have never forwarded/talked/etc to them anything POPI related


[25-Jan-25 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah idc.... Whoever is doing these "edits"... Is messing with Archiel's GOV sheet, which most GOVs/ PMs use for POPR projections. Make same noise, and fix that shit.


[25-Jan-25 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Whatever presumptions you've made about me for a long time have been sorely mistaken. I'm not sure why you didn't ask up front. I can talk to the one person from the fio.fnar domain that I know within the FIO discord Corp, but we've never talked anything popi/Calculations before.


[25-Jan-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Someone's doing it... I wouldn't care otherwise if there was some annotations at the bottom denoting ANY changes... But there's none... And the whole PRUN community is taking it as fact. This last clause, is my issue.


[25-Jan-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	On the link you sent above?


[25-Jan-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Uh huh.


[25-Jan-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I care about accuracy as well.


[25-Jan-25 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Can you expand on what's wrong? I only know of 3 people who have database edit access to that and I'll ping them all as a group. I doubt it's Saga with IRL stuff, but I'll include him anyways.


[25-Jan-25 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	There may be more open sourcing to that website? But I only know of 3 for sure.


[25-Jan-25 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'll just type it out....


[25-Jan-25 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Why is https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/index.html#education 0.0, on ENG -- > SCI education rates, rather than 0.05?

[25-Jan-25 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Why is UNI rates, under the same, 0.004, rather than 0.002?


[25-Jan-25 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's it?


[25-Jan-25 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Sorry, I had to step away for a minute.


[25-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Eng to sci should be changed in the chart from 0 to 0.005?


[25-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I didn't think there was a baseline tier 0 inherent upgrade from eng to sci.


[25-Jan-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The base edu rate of ENG>SCI is 0


[25-Jan-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But you're also saying all the numbers called out are essentially double what they actually are?


[25-Jan-25 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I think Roh is confused by the old numbers of how POPI used to work - a while back the devs doubled the rates for PBH/LIB/UNI, and increased the base edu rate by 0.005 for all other tiers but ENG>SCI


[25-Jan-25 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Who knows right? Of course this universe has been around for what? 3 or so years? Those numbers shouldn't have been changed, unless it be evidenced via some patch via simulogics.


[25-Jan-25 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Can confirm on multiple planets POPR's that the numbers on that sheet are accurate, except PIO>SET should be 0.025 (Archiels sheet also has 0.025)


[25-Jan-25 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@realbandit gimme a patch note, via hyperlink


[25-Jan-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I'm not digging through years of updates. Find a single POPR that shows otherwise


[25-Jan-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	All I'm asking for, is a patch note. If you can't give one.. Why are you typing then?


[25-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I've found multuple that confirm those numbers. Vallis, Circe, Etherwind itself.


[25-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ahh right... Your maths? Since you can't confer a patch note?


[25-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	burden of doubt is on you, I'm not wasting my time confirming numbers myself and plenty others have confirmed many times.


[25-Jan-25 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Feel free to find the devlog yourself.


[25-Jan-25 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Though the devs do have a way of letting us find these things out ourselves, as we know from our plentiful experience with POPI research


[25-Jan-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Check out PCT-Popi Discussion - 1/8/24 PiBoy confirming Educ rates.


[25-Jan-25 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	If you want to continue with your conspiracy theories, go ahead, but find proof to back it up first.


[25-Jan-25 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Find me a single planet where the PBH/LIB/UNI use the rates you believe them to be.


[25-Jan-25 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah.. "secret dev changes" LOL.. K thanks, I'll run my own numbers then...


[25-Jan-25 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Rwinner16 current CX prices via LIB bonuses should make that POPI building a priority, lest you can make PBH's for less than 1/2 of the LIB cost.


[25-Jan-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's systemic consequences for education POPI upgrades, but I guess you'll find those out in the long term.

[25-Jan-25 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Man, that was a weird hill to die on. Realbandit has over 500d on Roh, and Rwinner almost 400, so its a bit weird to tell them about long term consequences


[25-Jan-25 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Roh's always been that way. He/She is very difficult to interact with when they start with the approach they do.


[25-Jan-25 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I can't figure out if it's just a lack of communication awareness or a I'm better than you mentality.


[25-Jan-25 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ty @Rwinner16 for working on the popi stuff. Even if this planet doesnt use it, it migrates out to the rest of the universe, so it helps somebody


[25-Jan-25 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I appreciate that! I know I'm not running it the "efficient" or most "cost effective", but everything I've put into this planet I've done via direct CONTs to players. So it's feeding an in/out economy. I'd contract out the POPI upkeeps too, but a lot of those are hard to get sourcing. Specific oddball buildings that take away from larger players vertical integration abilites.


[25-Jan-25 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I have 2, 1000 area IDC MM bases for the sole purpose of paying to expand and provide upkeeps for EW; just an FYSA.


[25-Jan-25 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Nice nice. Have you considered 6 500A bases instead of 2 1000A? Or would the logistical strain not be worth it?


[25-Jan-25 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	IDC bases are like the lowest upkeep bases you could think of. 0 inputs; just drop 60 day CONs and fly in once every 60 days with CONS and repair FABs. Export bulk IDC


[25-Jan-25 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I guess I could add another 4 1000 area MM bases. It's not a permit issue; moreso I haven't run the CX's in a long time to see if they can support more. I presume the UNI has expanded to cover the MEA demand.


[25-Jan-25 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Wasnt an ask so much as curiosity why the two 1000a bases vs six 500a base


[25-Jan-25 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Oh. Simplicity and laziness honestly lol.


[25-Jan-25 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I was too lazy to fly 3 ships to each site every 60 days.


[25-Jan-25 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	Even if it's a lack of communication skills/awareness it's still just arrogant and rude. It's been a problem in discord servers too, they alway have to seem the expert on every topic. Usually they have some good points and it's at least polite though. This is just so unneccesarily confrontational and disrespectful. Like, why? Why would the first assumption be conspiracies about malicious manipulation instead of just asking if the devs changed something?... anyway, end of rant. Just felt the need to say *something* cause you've always been extremely friendly and helpful to so many people Rwinner


[25-Jan-25 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Hey Cpt, random topic shift but i heard you help out the ADI quite a bit, or at least did. Is that true?


[25-Jan-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah when I can :) it was the inspiration for the new BEST group to support the Benten area. I stuggle to ship anything to ANT and only have 1 producing base so I don't do as much anymore.


[25-Jan-25 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Whats the ADI


[25-Jan-25 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Is there anything else you guys woud like to see on/from EW?


[25-Jan-25 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yeah, sorry about the bad PIO levels. I had really wanted to not have to use FEST 3's and see if inputs alone would cover it. It was too little too late. Everyhing should be restored in 3 hours or so.


[05-Mar-25 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The POPI sheet shows we should have a massive surge in PIO's. Kinda creating a whole new problem, but I'd rather that than be suffering a Tier 1 shortage.

[05-Mar-25 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yup


[05-Mar-25 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	along with the cost of mats added to POPI, very expensive worker addition :)


[05-Mar-25 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	although technically the planet isn't paying for anything - @Rwinner subsidizes this planet


[05-Mar-25 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Engineer_Gaming**:	Like does crops grow so slow theres no idea to do it or is it just a minor inconvenience


[05-Mar-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and no help from the CoGC since that's resource extraction, not agriculture


[05-Mar-25 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Engineer_Gaming**:	becasue i was thinking maybe to grow some to pruduce carbon for my smelter and maybe to produce som RAT and DW, to bring down my own cost


[05-Mar-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	most efficient use of space/resources on Etherwind is to max out rigs, drawing water....sell that to fund everything else....next base to be FI to process into DW


[05-Mar-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	self-sufficiency on one base slows your progression


[05-Mar-25 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(I know from personal experience - my first month I was a self-sufficient farmer on Verdant....my prod lines were so convoluted I couldn't micro manage it and realized finally why everyone was telling me not to do that)


[05-Mar-25 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	aligning with the cogc, single prod line, will max out experts faster as well


[05-Mar-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and be a more efficient use of space/workforce....on one permit here you can have like 36 Rigs generating over 2k water per day


[05-Mar-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	your starter ships can move 2500 water per trip


[05-Mar-25 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	@atlantisrising yes, every POPR all available workers are redistributed round-robin style to all companies that need them. So you can lose workers no matter how long you've been running a base. That's why governing is important. You'll be good here though.


[05-Mar-25 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	@Engineer_Gaming you can see using sites like PRUNplanner.org or yapt (I think? not at my PC rn)


[05-Mar-25 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Workforce Reserve Pool limits how much you can lose to redistribution during worker shortages, so it tends to be more inconvenient than destructive.


[05-Mar-25 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ah. Didn't know they were _re_distributed each time. Good to know


[05-Mar-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Wow. That's a crap ton of PIO growth. Nobody should be hurting now lol


[05-Mar-25 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Interesting development....have to check spreadsheet again when I get off work


[05-Mar-25 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Open jobs is a retroactive identification. It shows how many open jobs there were coming into the POPR

[23-Mar-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	yes I know it's not the "cost efficient" way of managing the planet. It's not about that. It's about channeling cashflow from EW's IDC base to EW upkeepers


[23-Mar-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I'm not following that logic


[23-Mar-25 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It's from our FIO mentality. "Space Commies". Everything free (Hence no taxes), and equal distributions.


[23-Mar-25 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I could keep the profits from the IDC base I have, but it was funded and set up to benefit Etherwind. It's funded the expansions, but still has a very healthy weekly surplus since the levels on a lot of needed ones are maxed


[23-Mar-25 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I can either keep leveling the POPI buildings, or start to divest the profits towards planet members. POPI upkeeps are a way to do that.


[24-Mar-25 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I don't think much else needs upgraded here

[25-Mar-25 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i think you gotta adjust the pricing a bit :-D. It's more than 50% over CX price


[25-Mar-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	true true, but there is slight difference, here you can have them instantly ;), I sell only my products and I am trying to bypass the 166/u RAT max sell barrier to make better, loan free living and others rising prices on CX levels, this is just local and at least there is some added value


[25-Mar-25 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuxus342**:	fair, but if you cant produce everything you need to run a base consumable whise i still have to go to the CX for the rest. and if thet i the case i might aswell by all of it at the cx


[25-Mar-25 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	While the "Emergency/Immediacy" tax does sound logical, but you have to remember people will quite often give out consumables upon request for little to nothing, especially if you are a new player that is needing it. Also worth noting, the entire planet is free of taxes or upkeep responsibilities (usually kept up in taxes to payout supplier) due to the hard work of the FIO Corp that runs this planet


[25-Mar-25 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	We some commies who look out for each other


[25-Mar-25 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	and if you want to adhere to emergency buys you should make the size of your ads smaller. when i need 10 emergency DW i wont buy 500 when my ship arrives the day after.


[25-Mar-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuxus342**:	you could peddle the entire shipping deal. check hou much some one needs. charge 5-10% on the order for convenience and shipping. and put in you own product to increase profit

**SilentReaper**:	yo coffee, I sent you an invite to EFIO, our corp on Etherwind. Doesn't mean you're joining our corp. Just that you get the 10% production bonus to all your buildings on Etherwind.


[07-Apr-25 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We offer it to all that set up here if they want it.


[07-Apr-25 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoffeeCupMassacre**:	Ah okay. So if I was thinking of joining another corp, would I hold off on accepting or can you be in more than 1 corp?


[07-Apr-25 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You can leave the in-game corp whenever you wish.


[07-Apr-25 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoffeeCupMassacre**:	Okay, thank you!


[07-Apr-25 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Although you'll find that often what in game corp you're in doesn't matter as much as where the HQ is located. That's why we (FIOC) have 3 different "corps" with HQs on different planets.


[07-Apr-25 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
