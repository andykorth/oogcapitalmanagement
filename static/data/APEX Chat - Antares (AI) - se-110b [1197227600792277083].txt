[12-Dec-24 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i'm dropping a 800 PIO+400 SET base this POPR, FYI for gov


[12-Dec-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	All good, we should be running a large surplus of PIO and SET just for the occasion. I've been wanting to get that unemployment down


[12-Dec-24 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Hello fellow sketchy hydroponic enthusiasts


[12-Dec-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	sketchy?? speak for yourself, i run an upstanding company


[12-Dec-24 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	I heard that, unlike LIFE, SE-110b never gets visited by the galactic food and drug administration inspectors


[12-Dec-24 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	And is a den of illicit Ag activity


[12-Dec-24 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i may be upstanding, but i'm also no snitch so...


[12-Dec-24 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	ü§ê


[12-Dec-24 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	What's the finished product of what you're growing here, a RAT??


[12-Dec-24 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i would never


[12-Dec-24 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i'm gonna be making COF & C


[12-Dec-24 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i advocate for the PIOs


[12-Dec-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I'm the RAT farmer out here


[12-Dec-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iCooper**:	I‚Äôm growing CAF and then making COF utilizing the H20 and DW from my SE-110c base.


[12-Dec-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	I just make C


[12-Dec-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	and then use my extra prod to make make like ALG or something


[13-Dec-24 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	ahoy! heads up for another 8 HYF being shipped in.


[13-Dec-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	I'll start slow. Is there any timing I should keep in mind?


[14-Dec-24 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	Don't worry too much about the pop. If we need a burst I can run a program or add another mat or two to the infirmary (I have them on hand already) to get things growing at max speed.


[14-Dec-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	Rodger that. Thanks for facilitating


[15-Dec-24 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	I grow HCP here, MAI on Harmonia and GRN on Demeter. Burn it all on Nascent at max speed for tons of C


[15-Dec-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Why not just grow HCP on LIFE then? Right next door to Harmonia


[15-Dec-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	longer flight time from ISA


[15-Dec-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the 1-3hr flights in SE-110 are quite nice


[16-Dec-24 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	I suppose I am assuming that the Harmonia base is also being supplied by ISA production


[16-Dec-24 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i mean FRM water demand is so low they don't really need ISA


[16-Dec-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	I actually gather water on Etherwind and have HYF on Harmonia. I ship that water to all three of the bases. There's probably a fair amount of optimization I could do now, but I've had these bases for a while...
