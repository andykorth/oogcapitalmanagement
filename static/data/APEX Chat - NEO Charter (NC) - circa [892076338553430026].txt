**MadMonk21**:	is there any benefit to building a WAR here on planet? knowing that people can use the LM if they have a WAR on planet? to potentially sell goods through the LM? or is that not really a concern for people here?


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'd be happy to help contribute


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	I don't really think it is a goal of ours currently, but you are welcome to finance it.  We will be working on the CoGC next


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	now that the PAR is finished


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	ooh, that would be nice (especially depending on how it voted lol)


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I could contribute to that


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	not sure I can do any of the mats, but can chip in funds


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or whatever is needed


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	we plan to vote manufacturing


[28-Oct-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that's less helpful for me then, lol, but makes sense


[28-Oct-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	my chemistry operation must not be in the majority


[28-Oct-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	probably not.  We do most of our chem on Circe.

**Spice**:	Sup


[05-Nov-21 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	me and my 11 settlers have opened up shop


[05-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	We're in great situation here settler-wise, happy pops around :)


[05-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	so that will fill up in no time


[05-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	also welcome :)


[05-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	my last drop and expansion should happen later today, then it's ramping up to get all my workers and this base will be full!


[05-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	alright, last expansion dropped, need 169 Settlers and 113 Pios to be full up!


[09-Nov-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyone have 3 PT, 3 EXO they could sell on planet? I'm out and my next shipment doesn't arrive until tomorrow


[09-Nov-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Procytron**:	Welcome


[23-Nov-21 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyone want some cheap NA? or want to buy some HAL? just realized that my base is full


[23-Nov-21 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I have 512 NA I can sell


[23-Nov-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	alright, I need to clear out space on my base. I am giving away 512 NA for free if anyone will take them off my hands. Please respond quick if you can, I have a shipper waiting to be able to deliver and I'm out of space


[23-Nov-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or just take the ads on the LM


[23-Nov-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	thanks, @Lekvarky


[23-Nov-21 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	If it was on Cerci, I take it all, have a ship flying there, but here... :)


[23-Nov-21 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that was enough to get my goods delivered and then picked up, so I appreciate it


[23-Nov-21 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	np, they should add a trash can into the game for for NA :)


[23-Nov-21 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	it would be nice to be able to get rid of goods somehow. Don't really feel like sending a ship out to haul a shipload of NA back to sell to the MM


[23-Nov-21 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	On Cerci I have more in than output so I don't mind taking it away, but I don't have logistics figured out for this base yet, it will generate/accept very small shipments :).


[23-Nov-21 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	Maybe I will be taking your NA away in the ship :D.


[23-Nov-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that's fine, I'm happy to just get rid of it lol

**Lekvarky**:	Are there any plans to build SST 2?


[30-Nov-21 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	I think we will evaulate how things look after this popi and decide what we want to do next.  I have some SUN onsite if we need to add the 3rd input to the SST now.


[30-Nov-21 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	I fed 30 last update, to make sure I get full base :). Anyway I don't plan to use Techs or anything in near future, just asking.


[30-Nov-21 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	right on, the over all goal is to keep the steady growth we have going here.  We will probably be looking into some culture or education next, but if Safety is needed then we will add it.


[30-Nov-21 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	Cool, thanks.

[27-Dec-21 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or NA? I will just give up to 600 NA away if you'll take it off my hands


[12-Jan-22 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	NA is a responsibility. You must dispose of it responsibly. Don't just leave it laying about.


[12-Jan-22 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah clearly. Made that mistake and filled my base


[12-Jan-22 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	can't I just have my workers sprinkle it on their food?


[12-Jan-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ruyagormeyenadam**:	vauw


[12-Jan-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ruyagormeyenadam**:	how possible


[12-Jan-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	feel like I got caught with the smoking gun here, but all I did was vote! lol


[12-Jan-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	we sent molp a DM to take a look at it, he stated he would check it out when he gets in tomorrow.


[12-Jan-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	it had to be some weird bug.


[12-Jan-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that would be my guess as well


[12-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	unless i found the cheat code by having too much NA in my base...


[12-Jan-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	lol that could be it :D


[12-Jan-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	Hey guys, anyone knwos how did we end up with chem CoGC? It looked like manu was miles ahead and only option


[12-Jan-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	was it some weird bug?


[12-Jan-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that's not right. I mean I voted for Chem but I was the only one and there were way more votes in Manu

[19-Jan-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	did the COGC issue ever get figured out?


[19-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	molp said he didn't see a problem in the logs, so we just let it go.  but looks like we are back to Manu


[19-Jan-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hmm, that's really odd


[19-Jan-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but I suppose it righted itself at least


[19-Jan-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	yeah it was.  I'm sure it was a bug and I would not be surprised if it happens again on other planets.

**Koibu**:	I mentioned this in Circe chat, but in case people here don't have a base there as well, I've built a glass ship here for dedicated shipping. I'll be making daily runs between our two planets. I don't need that much space on the boat, so feel free to dump shipping ads as often and for as much space as you need

[28-Mar-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	and here I was hoping you had the opposite NA problem :(


[28-Mar-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyway to just bury it all in a hole?


[28-Mar-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	everyone has excess NA


[28-Mar-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	During my first term of Governor, I've been trying to figure out how much I put towards the planet and how much taxes take out of that. Right now it seems the average cost to upkeep Circa, after taxes, is right around 350-400k every 10d. Now that I understand the trend, I am proposing that I raise taxes starting next period for TECs, ENGs, and SCIs to 150, 450, and 1350 respectively to get an idea of how that changes the financial situation. An alternative is if I were to get monetary or material donations to put towards upkeep.


[28-Aug-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll be raising the taxes on Friday then, a bit before the end of the period. First full tax dividend I received was 120k, second/last one I got was 150k. I'll let it be known how much of a change it is :]

[31-Aug-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I've placed a small order on LM, thanks


[31-Aug-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I come here pretty often, we'll see if you can catch the next one :}


[01-Sep-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Alright, I've went and changed the taxes to meet what I said earlier in chat, summary: PIO/SET/TEC/ENG/SCI Before 22/35/55/70/85 After 22/35/150/450/1350


[01-Sep-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Not on the upcoming tax, but the one after (in the event I remain governor) I'll report how much of an increase that adds to taxes. Current average is ~135k


[02-Sep-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Anyone need anything MOR -> Circa? 500/500 space available. Leaving in ~40m


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If anyone has some spare drinking water, my resupply is running behind.  Check the LM.


[02-Sep-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Next term I will be looking to see if anyone can supply me with the following materials: OFF, TUB, FOD, & PFE. Currently have enough/on the way to fill them up for another 9-15 days, but if you're interested, message me and we can negotiate pricing :]


[03-Sep-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	2750t/875m available heading from Circa -> MOR in a few hours. Let me know if you have anything you want me to take, I'll be on and off so auto-provisioned LM ads might be the way to go :]


[03-Sep-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I've posted an ad on the LM: 44/44, thanks in advance


[03-Sep-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Gotcha - I'll be heading out in 30m. I'll message you the ETA when I head out :]


[03-Sep-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	thanks, it will be Wednesday before I make my weekly stop at Circa


[03-Sep-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	So far I've made the trip ~3 times a week. Just making sure I have all the upkeep I need, for my base and the planet :]


[03-Sep-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Might look into putting down a few more BMPs...


[03-Sep-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	This dividend was 3/7d of increased taxes but the dividend was 30k more than the previous tax dividend. So far it has been 2.3k, 120.6k, 153.3k, and now 181.5k. I'm guessing it might run somewhere around 200k on average in the future


[03-Sep-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Being in the 200k range will definitely make upkeep less painful to afford. Also I have been keeping a somewhat rough balance sheet if you guys ever want me to share it :]


[06-Sep-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Anybody have an extra BSE they could part with?  It turns out that I am not a logistics wizard.


[07-Sep-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	^ Departed


[10-Sep-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	New tax dividend came in, before we were averaging ~135k/w for taxes, it seems to have almost doubled as the past weeks taxes came to 264k. This should make supplying upkeep a bit more comfortable for me as it will be covering a more decent chunk of it. :]

**Filefolders**:	200 FEO


[20-Sep-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can have it for 30 each.


[20-Sep-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	thats 1180 tons.  I'd need 3 trips to haul it :(


[20-Sep-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I can divide the lot, my guy.


[20-Sep-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	no offense intended.  I just don't have the shipping capacity to buy it


[20-Sep-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, I figured my inability to transport it probably wasn't going to be unique.


[20-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I've avoided resource collection (ore or gas).  Too hard on shipping


[20-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	:)


[20-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Whoops.


[20-Sep-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I have a ship dedicated to it, but a little bit has accumulated.


[20-Sep-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I can carry more than one mine can put out but not as much as two.


[20-Sep-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I'll just need to tear down the second one, I guess.  Master planner right here.


[20-Sep-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@DarkKing, where would you want the FEO?


[20-Sep-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I just saw the 30NCC per unit profit for hauling it to the CX.


[20-Sep-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	but I don't have any smelters or any use for FE


[20-Sep-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Ah I see


[20-Sep-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I could play dumb and just set down a few smelters here


[20-Sep-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Thank you @Filefolders :]


[20-Sep-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Well, whatever you do, you can't play as dumb as I do.


[20-Sep-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Put down EXTs for FEO then realized they outproduce your shipping capacity?


[20-Sep-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I knew there would be a surplus.  I underestimated how much of a hassle it would be.


[20-Sep-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Anyway.  Check back in two weeks when this happens again, I guess.


[20-Sep-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Because of the pricing, just send me a contract when it occurs and I'll accept it :]


[20-Sep-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Thanks.  Slimmer margins but better than sitting idle.


[20-Sep-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Next time you can up it to 35/u if it makes you feel better


[20-Sep-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Hah.  Well, if you're offering, why not?


[20-Sep-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You could also switch them to HAL, another idea :p


[20-Sep-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I could.  I don't have internal need for HAL, so I don't want to move it, but I can produce it if you want it.


[20-Sep-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	How many EXTs do you have?


[20-Sep-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Two.


[20-Sep-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think keeping up the FEO wouldn't be bad


[20-Sep-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's like ~80/d if I remember the extraction on here correctly


[20-Sep-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Between the two, yeah.


[20-Sep-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Much lower extraction rate of HAL.


[20-Sep-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Lower extraction rate but better cost, but yeah I could try and setup some use of iron here :]


[20-Sep-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Well, I'm hoping to resolve my shipping bottleneck eventually, but that's going to take a long time.


[20-Sep-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I getcha


[20-Sep-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Just finally got my STL ship setup...now I'm dreaming of a fuel saving engine rather than glass


[20-Sep-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But everyone could use more shipping capacity :p


[20-Sep-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Aw.


[20-Sep-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	HAL is about 14 units/day per extractor


[20-Sep-23 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Well, if someone wants to pay me for that, I can throw it into the mix.


[20-Sep-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I get exactly 10/d with my 5 EXTs here, only mine it to sell to a corp mate at the moment though


[20-Sep-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Well 10/d per EXT p

If anyone wants to wants to step up and give governing Circa a try I'll support you, especially if you have a better understanding of population than me haha. Don't have much financially but I'll obviously hand off my last tax check to whoever wins, along with any pop inputs I have on hand that would be of use to them.

[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hahaha


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I might've considered continuing my governorship if they already released the politics changes (government bank account and governors can go to their main corps)


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But it's also taking a bit my weekly income so I can't really expand comfortably right now


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Unsure why it is expected for governors to keep taxes so low that they lose money


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Just tracking how much you spend on governing is a chore


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So I don't think it's so much of an expectation as that it's hard to compute what your expected spend rate is


[09-Oct-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Currently taxes are averaging 310k/wk. Average spending is 500-650k - to give an idea to anyone that is 'interested' in taking over


[09-Oct-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Sounds like taxes need to double.


[09-Oct-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll look into it, if no one is too bothered by me raising taxes further, I could try and figure out what'd be a necessary rate in order for the next governor to have the easiest time supporting the planet - this time will include PIO and SET, though I'll go easier on them this first week to get an idea


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll do this later today if no one has anything to say against it


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Gotta spend more on your campaign man...


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I already spent it all on warehouse upgrades


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Lmao


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That is technically spending it on the campaign...


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Nah man, I needed that space to keep all the loot I embezzle as governor


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I intend to run away after the first term with my gov  issued escalade full of gold bars


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The taxes can still go higher ;]


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Does it break even after you raised them or still a money pit?


[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Oct-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm stashing all the infrastructure upkeep stuff there so it doesn't get in the way of my own production storage, and what it was before just wasn't gonna cut it for me

[04-Nov-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	We could even build a shipyard! It'd be 100% pointless, but we could do it!


[20-Nov-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	LOL! I just noticed OT-889d had no higher level workers, so my SPF needs a home.


[20-Nov-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Let me know if you do go that route as I'd probably need to be more diligent about keeping the university supplied


[20-Nov-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's the one thing I've been slacking on


[21-Nov-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I am kinda torn at the moment - understanding the problem with Montem, I am trying to be careful with where I put higher level worker buildings.


[21-Nov-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I talked with the governor on OT-889d and he did put in the infrastructure and the population is much lower - so I think that is a better place to put it.


[21-Nov-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Here we have alot more pioneers, which would make it more expensive - so I think I will try to work with him so OT-889d can be higher level manufacturing

[26-Nov-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Gotcha sir


[27-Nov-23 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So minor update as 'governor' - my original plan of "fill progress bars" is working great - but now that I understand what I'm supposed to actually do - it's a very bad plan - as all I'm actually doing is creating a happy and growing population of unemployed people. So while 79% happiness is good, 23,33,33,20,5% unemployment across the tiers isn't.  There are two ways to 'solve' this. More employers - or less population.


[27-Nov-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I intend to tackle both of these. So first and foremost, I will be offering heavily discounted tier 1 prefabs with payment due in 90 days for anyone who wants to use these to build or expand a base here. So talk to your friends and tell them that you know an idiot willing to sell them a BSE for 1k and they won't have to pay for 3 months


[27-Nov-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I will also start to supply less upkeep to push the happiness down a bit and start to reduce population down to 10% unemployment across the board if possible.


[27-Nov-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Finally, I'm new to this whole gov thing so if you are not and what I'm saying is dumb and wrong - let me know


[27-Nov-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It seems like you're grasping the ropes of population now, just taking it in the opposite direction that I did - instead of providing the bare minimum to try and keep the status quo for the population, you seem to be providing enough to just ensure there are jobs whether that causes more unemployment or not. Just comes down to how much money you have..


[27-Nov-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	On the topic of getting people to settle bases here..I'll advertise on Avalon your idea and see if anyone's willing to bite, if you want :}


[27-Nov-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'll try to fix it - Open to suggestions on best approach to it.


[20-May-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	POPI looks like its in the right direction.  Its a lagging average.


[20-May-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Engineer immigration brings in 50.  The advanced education improves the level up by 30%.  IAs this is 99 currently I think this is ~30 which ies less than 50... _however_ there are also sci unemployment (9 jobs jopen) and this also helps get eng to sci tier workers.


[20-May-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One thing to watch for is happiness overshoot.  As soon as you start getting migration _in_ keep an eye on the popr so that you don't get way too many unemployed workers that consume POPI upkeep.


[20-May-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I've been trying to push the unemployment problem through Education programs to push them up - and that sort of kind of works. Not actually sure why I had a sudden ENG drop - I'll throw some more porn at them or something


[20-May-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I don't think it was caused by an engineer drop - we had 2,111 with 15% unemployment (#151) which would imply 1,794 jobs.  But #152 had 1,955 ENG with 3.4% unemployment - 1,885 jobs


[20-May-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The current #154 has 108 open jobs with 1,989 ENG - which implies 2,097 jobs - so I think this is more a case of more jobs rather than less Engineers.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hello! I was planning on coming back to Circa when the politics update was released and it seems it's time. Mordgier let me know that I could run in his place. I'd appreciate it if we could get your votes, I'm hoping to become governor again while @Filefolders and @Andy97 are going to help me govern. I hope to continue running the planet the same way @Mordgier has been running it, but any input would be appreciated! :]


[26-Jun-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Circa had solid governance from MysteriousWalrus when I landed here, and I see no reason it won't run smoothly with him reelected.


[26-Jun-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Hats off to Mordgier for the job he's done all this time!


[26-Jun-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I just hope nobody votes for a carpetbagger who doesn't even have a base on this planet.


[27-Jun-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I didn't really change anything from how Walrus ran it. I'll be leaving ~10m in the gov treasury and a bunch of supplies so Walrus will be ruling from a golden throne


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	So do we just vote for one person?  Or do we vote for three because the parliament will be three?


[27-Jun-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One non-transferable vote (STV would have been interesting ... and a pain to code)


[27-Jun-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	^ @CraftsmanThirteen you're able to vote for one person but three people can win the race, technically

Single non-transferable vote
Single non-transferable vote or SNTV is an electoral system used to elect multiple winners. It is a generalization of first-past-the-post, applied to multi-member districts with each voter casting just one vote. Unlike FPTP, which is a single-winner system, in SNTV multiple winners are elected, typically in electoral districts; additionally, unl...

[10-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Andy97**:	That would be a really cool addition


[10-Jul-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I was just thinking about that earlier


[10-Jul-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It would be cool, considering the ADM takes up a plot on the planet, meaning it's technically upwards of 1000 area. It'd make sense if it could store items (especially large quantities)


[10-Jul-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You just want it to store more rocks


[10-Jul-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	And why should he?


[10-Jul-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I was pretty much baffled that the gov couldn't have a warehouse or place orders or own ships


[10-Jul-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	That's what I would have really wanted from this update, an actual separation of gov and corp as entities - all I got was a wallet and motions to do anything - just more clicks to do the same thing.


[10-Jul-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's a foundation for those things, at least.  Those would have been very nice to have though, for sure.


[15-Jul-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I could see the gov having a warehouse and being able to place orders - that would make alot of sense.  But owning ships might be a bridge too far.


[15-Jul-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yeah I agree - this government as implemented now feels like a half measure. It solves one or two relatively minor issues, but in exhange creates a larger burden.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Over the next however long - we'll be trying to reduce the amount of unemployment to try and get the population to a more reasonable and manageable size - this may end up hurting SCIs, and slightly hurting ENGs. I wish there was a better way to go about it but 40% unemployment for PIO, SET, and TEC is something that should *probably* be toned down a bit if possible :]
