**Ubermensch**:	I posted in the UFO Discord - I've set up an LM at AM-371f in order to supply cheap H locally.  Reach out to schedule a pickup


[04-Oct-21 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**elliotwms**:	Welcome!


[06-Oct-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	Hey Guys! Do we have someone who can deliver NS on the LM? Thinking of building an HYF, but for this I would need some NS on this planet.


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I can make it - how much per day will you need?


[07-Oct-21 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	Nice! I will take a closer look in the next days when I have the building materials. I will come back to you, but I think around 10/day is the number to go ;)


[07-Oct-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	first batch of Hops is almost done, I might wait until after I get back from Vacation to drop the FER.....that way I have a working buffer


[12-Oct-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elliotwms**:	I also have a HYF up now, with a steady demand of at least 8/day so far


[12-Oct-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elliotwms**:	(8/day of NS)


[12-Oct-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elliotwms**:	though I suspect that will go up when I actually build somewhere for settlers to live


[14-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	for those not often on the UFO discord - wanted to highlight the new thread in the Pyrgos General to discuss if we want to put in an application for a CX to be put at or near Pyrgos


[16-Oct-21 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	anyone selling DDT here yet


[16-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	posted 2 - I make it in rotation with some other things.  will need ALE to speed it up ;)


[16-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and i need DDT to make the ALE


[16-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i will drop the FER in 3-4 days

**McGangsta**:	you guys deal in NCC as well?


[19-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ALE posted on LM


[20-Oct-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I have base on Montem - so I do a lot of NCC.  but sometimes I help ship to Moria for a few others so there's some other NCC interest


[20-Oct-21 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ulfur**:	I often fly to MOR, so I also do a lot in NCC. Although I not that far in the game to use ALE yet.


[20-Oct-21 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	making about 6-12 ALE a day now

**corrim**:	anyone doing BHP locally?


[21-Oct-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**scvalex**:	I'm doing them in Katoa and have regular flights to Pyrgos.


[21-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok,I need DDT


[21-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	posted 2


[21-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	also - I have a surprise for everyone....


[21-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i voted


[21-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I contributed first week's materials except the 60 PE, which I didn't realize we'd need and didn't have


[21-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ElderOne**:	PE done


[21-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	Nice - and with that - Pyrgos has a CoGC.  Each week, we vote on the benefit (everyone is geting 10% boost to pioneers right now as default for first week)


[21-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I think we should either be Agriculture or Food Processing - our two biggest industries


[21-Oct-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ulfur**:	Thanks a lot!


[21-Oct-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ulfur**:	Agriculture seems a good boost.


[21-Oct-21 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	if we pick a worker - it's 10% to that worker in all buildings.  if we pick an industry, it's 25% boost to any building of that industry


[21-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	My 2cents, I make only DW, so agriculture is a complete loss.  I know for making DW, extraction is the absolute win.  I don't know how the numbers work out for RAT, but I'm bettting the RIG cost is still there too


[21-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	so food processing would be better in that case - benefitting both RAT and DW


[21-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	One EW, with 5 experts + COGC on extraction it still works out that most of the cost for DW is the RIG time, but yes, FP would be a solid second


[21-Oct-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	So there are a lot of boost that are very specific to small populations, but the workers are good across all industry, and Agriculture has a small cross over as welll


[21-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ElderOne**:	So we are thinking maybe Pioneers??


[22-Oct-21 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I'd be ok with Pioneers, Resource, FRM or FP.  would just re-jiggy base to be less of what we boost and more of the other to offset


[22-Oct-21 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	and people can change their vote next few days - so having this debate now has merit


[22-Oct-21 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ulfur**:	I have a very mixed base, with a huge part being farm/FP and RIG. So an overall pioneer boost might be the way that everyone is benefitting?


[22-Oct-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ElderOne**:	ship departing for BEN w/in 3 hours  280 t free 5 per CIS/NCC


[22-Oct-21 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elliotwms**:	Cool, just listed some shipments


[24-Oct-21 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i willpicj up shipments to Monty tomorrow and leave


[26-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	A few of you voted FOOD IND, that is not going to win, it might be worth a look to see which of the 2 PIO or RESOURCE EXT is a better program and vote for that....those 2 are really close


[27-Oct-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	If people would be open to a rotation -> say Resource then Agri then FP, I'd be willing to do that too


[27-Oct-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	I know a few other planets do that (say Metallurgy then Construction then back)

[24-Feb-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	That would work as well :)


[04-Mar-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pantalaimon**:	To be honest, PIO Bonus suits me very well. I have a 1000 Base full of Water, Agri and Food Production.


[04-Mar-22 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ulfur**:	I would be good with both: Agri or PIO


[06-Mar-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Any thoughts to where we want to go long term for COGC.  Pioneers is always the safe bet.  I used to vote resource extraction (making DW), but given how fertile the planet is, maybe go for agriculture?


[06-Mar-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Would get some massive gains coupling the third most fertile planet x1.25


[06-Mar-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	Hey guys! Back from vacation. I have put some ads on the LM for the upkeeps. If you want to donate stuff for upkeep please send me a short msg... it is way easier to track then. I try to post an overview every monday on the discord!

[16-Mar-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-22 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	want to move base to a big discount now


[24-Mar-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Well, Agri won, but lots more votes for this next cycle.   I'm hoping we can stick with Ag and adjust bases accordingly, but if it doesn't pan out, hopefully we can at least vote consistently (but Pioneers is far worse for me as I'm building FERs in the near future here)

[09-Apr-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Food for thought.  We are on the this most fertile planet.  I know pioneer gives us all a little boost, but multiplying our fertility with a Agriculture COGC would give all farms a massive boost.


[09-Apr-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	*third most fertile

[01-Jun-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	What type of program we want to run.  Agriculture gives a 25% boost to farms and pioneers 10% to buildings run with pioneers.  Agriculture stacks nicely with our fertility to give a nice big bost


[01-Jun-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	*boost


[01-Jun-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DBW2426**:	I have MHL's available for the creation of a HYF if anyone needs them?  I'll do a trade of 90 COF for the 16 MHL's if anyone is interested or 2500CIS for each


[11-Jul-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	As you may noticed already, I cut down the taxes by 40%. We have 75k CIS in our wallet and as I (we) do not have plans for bigger projects I see no reason to build a bigger wallet.


[12-Jul-22 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I was gonna say the population report would suggest its time to bump up the pioneer numbers, but I see the SST has been filled presumably for exactly that reason


[12-Jul-22 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Schlaumeier22**:	Yeah I run the SST with just DW for a couple of month now... If we need to change it up, I could put in a second input. Right now there are no open Jobs, so from my point of view there is no reason to change something... maybe if we drop more PIOs we could bump this numbers up

[15-Jul-22 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	When the next report runs (4 and a bit days) you'll get your pioneers


[15-Jul-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Ideally you expand right before the population report hits.  When you build a building there is a number in brackets that shows how many pioneers are avaiable immeidately


[15-Jul-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	If the reserve is large enough you can build whenever you want, but our excess isn't that big


[15-Jul-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Anpache**:	You two and your bigger planets that actually have population problems


[17-Oct-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SFScorpio**:	Huh? How does Vulcan have a population problem?


[17-Oct-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anpache**:	Pre-coffee wording. I meant more in the fact that compared to Vulcan and Deimos, Uponor has so few people. :/


[17-Oct-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anpache**:	Vulcan hasn't had issues since I set up there, and Paris fixed Deimos remarkably well.


[17-Oct-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	If you have population problems on Pyrgos please tell me. I'll try and sort it out if I can...

[05-Dec-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Willger**:	I'll tell you what my plan is, I want to buy H2O here, but I have a base with ORC, FRM and RIG, so there's no more room for STO and the 1500m³ are almost always full. I would also contribute with building material


[06-Dec-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	negative. I usually fly in mostly empty so importing it seemed worth the extra FRM. Might change that some day, but if I produced extra it would be hard to export it anyway

[30-Dec-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	If you upgrade the safety station then I believe it will double the upkeep requirements. Not a problem unless of course you are the governor and you have to pay it every 10 days. I can do a pioneer immigration program to boost numbers.

[25-Jan-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	about the last convo, i believe if you upgrade the safty station it will increse the upkeep, but it will also increse the amount of happiness it gives off for the same amount of inputs


[25-Jan-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	and you dont neccisarily need to pay the entire upkeep of the building


[25-Jan-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i could be wrong about the percentage of happiness per mat increase, but you def dont need to fulfill it all the way


[25-Jan-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	so you could upgrade the safty station, and then just not worry about one of the inputs


[25-Jan-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I rely on my Megatech partner for OFF for the SS. I really don't want to have to double the DW required every 3 days that I have to pay out, so unless anyone else on Pyrgos objects I'd rather keep the SS at level 1


[25-Jan-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i can make up for the DW easily


[25-Jan-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Sohako**:	oh, thanks for that hehe


[05-Feb-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	pop*(happyness -70%)=next Popr migration. That should get you roughly the number that can move on to planet.


[05-Feb-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	So currently its 68.1% meaning the last POPR would of had zero join and Zero leave (for Pioneer) this dosen't include education moves.

**Crash5291**:	Where i pulled 29 pioneer from the unemplyment pool instantly, but need to wait for POPR to possibly get the rest i need.


[05-Feb-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Currently there is 35,983 pioneer with 1.6% of that unemployed so the next popr that 1.6 could be alocated out to bases in need. Meaning there are ~575 up for grabs, If i am the only player needing workers then i could get afull fill. If i am not the only one i think its split equaly among the needy


[05-Feb-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I have noticed the SST was lvl 1 and with 35k pop thats low, so i dumped it up to lvl 4, this means it might be also possible to only feed it DW and OFF and still keep that happy


[05-Feb-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sohako**:	is migration and unemployment dealt in the same cycle? or migration comes first and unemployment in next cycle (2 week)


[05-Feb-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Its all dealt with weekly on the POPR time table (they happen from the time of day the planet was populated) How exactly it decided the migtation in relation to imigration i am not sure


[05-Feb-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Example is PG-027b POPR happens at 01:28 Mondays my time, so thats Sundays 20:28 GMT.


[05-Feb-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	IC-548c is Monday 16:34 GMT

[05-Feb-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I used to have the exact time last time i had a base on planet but my notes were tossed when i moved off months ago


[05-Feb-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Now i am back lol, Something to note is experts are tied to bases and when you remove the base they are lost and you start over if you build on the same planet again. im at 0 now and used to have 5 lol for AG and RE


[06-Feb-24 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	It hasn't helped that several people have set up bases here since the last report, and all needed a huge number of workers.


[06-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah im not expecting miracles lol, its just a RCO farm for a WPL base thats not set up yet so no big loss for me. Other might have more impact from the shortage i suppose


[06-Feb-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Nobody mentioned a shortage before this week, so I imagine it's only new residents who will be short of workers


[06-Feb-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	Thank you for taking such quick action to increase the population I appreciate it


[06-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I'm glad everyone is happy... Can somebody start feeding the needs of the SS please, since it now needs 200 DW every three days instead of 50 DW. I don't have that much spare!  That is the difference between level 1 and level 4


[06-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sohako**:	unemployment at 0%, that's too much power for the low class


[06-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	I would but unfortunately I have a loan to pay off and I am not producing DW yet


[06-Feb-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sohako**:	Just started 2 weeks ago, still need to get production going for a few things but maybe in a week I'll be able to dedicate parts of production to upkeep


[06-Feb-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Maybe the people who upgraded the SS will chip in?


[06-Feb-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	at cx prices it's actually cheaper to supply 2 SSTs with OFF/SUN than 4 SSTs with only DW, for exactly the same need fulfillment, so just depends if you're making or buying the DW. You can always shut off a couple of the SSTs if needed so you don't have to fill so much, but they're right that with only one SST we would start losing Pioneers even will all 3 items filled.


[06-Feb-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	actually not yet... mb, I was looking at satisfaction not happiness. yeah you only need DW on a single SST here... just shut the other 3 off


[06-Feb-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	you'd need at least 2 to *grow* Pioneer pop, but 4 is too many


[06-Feb-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	@Wildgardener i can dump DW to you for upkeep


[06-Feb-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Its inbound in the next supply ship. 1 Is to low, and while 4 may be to much its not that hard to wait out the popr and drop it to 3 and see how it fairs then drop it to 2 if needed its a pretty simple task. Target being 80-85% with zero unemployment as that will fill most bases dropped durring the week.


[06-Feb-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	hmm, yeah. I had some numbers manually entered in my spreadsheet that were throwing it off. You're right though, to fill the almost 2000 open jobs you need all 4 SST mostly supplied this popr cycle. after that you'd only need DW, or less SSTs. I imagine we'll see more people building here though with Harmonia and Proxion full. Nemesis and Pyrgos will look good


[06-Feb-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	People come, then they push off again. I've been here a while and there's rarely a constantly high demand for PIOs for very long. Can the SS be downgraded? I never wanted it at level 4


[06-Feb-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah, LR -> Population tab, you can edit the 'Target' column to decide how many of each building you want active. Buy you'll need at least 3 to fill these current open jobs

**Crash5291**:	I left before as the shipping time was just far to long to grow as i wanted with not enough ships. its somehting like 36hrs one way so 3 days round trip. Not an issue now but it was.


[06-Feb-24 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Nope thats starter ship speed, my LCB's are slower lol add 6-8 more hours. Supplies for the SST arrive in 34hrs. 5k DW, another 500 OFF and 120 SUN.


[06-Feb-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I can keep the COGC needs supplied, but I don't have enough nearly enough DW spare for the upgraded SS


[06-Feb-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	I've said before I can keep the DW stocked up indefinitely, ill be producing dw here for a long time


[06-Feb-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah DW's not an issue i sent 10 weeks worth lol


[07-Feb-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	in a 'LR CH-771a' buffer you go to the 'population' tab then click edit. Then change the SS 'Target' value from 'max' to 9 or 8 or however many you want to be active

**Frosty802**:	Sorry just swallowing up all the spare PIOs, need another ~1300.


[25-Jun-24 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Welcome to Pyrgos. You'll be lucky to get that many...


[25-Jun-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Shouldn't be too difficult. PIO happiness is good. You could run the Festivities 2 program to raise happiness further for migration. Any reason why SS is targeted to Level 2?


[25-Jun-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I dropped it to level 2 after the recent mass exodus of players from the planet. It was raised to level 4 by somebody who came, wanted lots of PIOs, stayed a while and then left. I didn't want to pay upkeep on level 4 if it wasn't needed.


[25-Jun-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Fair


[25-Jun-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	where have they migrated too do you know? I found this as the best Agri plant for BEN space.


[25-Jun-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I don't know. I just notice the population drops every couple of months and names disappear from the Pyrgos user list.  Maybe distance is a factor?


[26-Jun-24 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jul-24 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Hello good people of Pyrgos. I have been your governor for many months now and have tried to keep fees to a minimum during this time. I hope you will vote for me again in the next election. Taiya, who named this planet many moons ago, has offered to assist me, as has my Megatech partner, Caretaker, who has contributed to the running costs of the planet over the past months. I hope you will support them both in the election - and keep Pyrgos the hidden (low fee) jewel in the Universe

[10-Sep-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**mrcoffee09**:	I could just continue adding FP/FRM/RIG in the same ratio I've got.  That's my default plan


[20-Sep-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	@mrcoffee09 Also new on this planet. I construct sets of FRM+FP+RIG and have the farm grow GRN+NUT+BEA at the fastest/most water intensive way. The FPs turn those into RAT and any excess H2O is turned into DW. As long as I supply them with OVE, it's self-reliant. Also kinda boring though but it keeps the PIOs alive on my other base.

[15-Oct-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	converted my base before i relized how much this place is only pios lol... was fine when i was doing rco/cot


[15-Oct-24 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i have no problem moving if i need to though but i reckon the game will give me what i need


[15-Oct-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	as of 7 days ago, there were about 1300 unemployed settlers waiting for a job


[15-Oct-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	The population on Pyrgos fluctuates wildly as players come and go for different reasons. It makes it hard to balance growth and unemployment for the government


[15-Oct-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. The issue is that it's so far from BEN. I produce HER so basically it's just a once a month checkup, import DDT and consumables export HER. But for anything else, the logistics is a bit too demanding when the travel time is like a day and a half both ways from BEN.


[15-Oct-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Shame as Pyrgos has such great fertility and so much H2O. But isn't much you can do unless you try and build out a local market for the stuff by developing local planets for things like food industries and such.


[15-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	There is a food producing planet next door. Not very well populated though


[15-Oct-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	gave me all the settlers i wanted... shorted me on the techs by 24 but i don't really mind... turns my 9 hour 17 minutes into 10 hour... not much in the grand scheme of things... maybe the fact that there is litterally zero unemployment will make them happy :)


[15-Oct-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	the techs are so little of the Orcs anyway


[15-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	synopsis... i'm staying... my 5 agr experts outweigh the lack of 24 techs...that i may eventually get anyway


[15-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	gonna use this planet for PIBs anyway as the galaxy doesn't need many


[15-Oct-24 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Pyrgos is slowly growing.


[17-Oct-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	it's a bit out in the boonies but it is a nice little planet


[17-Oct-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's a lot a bit out in the boonies. But worth it.


[17-Oct-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	so you guys don't convert it to RAT on the planet?  I'm making RAT and DW here


[17-Oct-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that's what i do too


[17-Oct-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	Ok good.  I know people tend to go with the COGC, but didn't know how strict


[17-Oct-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Hmm. I think for RATs and DW, you're probably better off settling on Etherwind. Pyrgos has powerful fertility. I use it for HER. Get that fertility bonus for my FRMs, and input tonnage is like 40/d or something like that. Requires a one monthly checkup.


[17-Oct-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I am here to supply my C production on Tacotopia with GRN, MAI, HCP


[17-Oct-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	With the boost from Pyrgos, I should make it to #1 C producer, if I can ship it all :)


[17-Oct-24 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	Very nice.  Yeah I thought about doing C here on pyrgos but it didn't seem practical to haul


[17-Oct-24 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	this is my second base, and my first one that runs well.  I'll keep this and use it to supply other bases.


[17-Oct-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	My first base is in gibson, sorta between here in benten, so I usually just move stuff there.  Then part of it gets consumed and I only haul the rest to benten


[17-Oct-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	I've got the capital to start another base, but I'm just overwhelmed with options.


[17-Oct-24 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yeah, so many different things possible


[17-Oct-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I will be churning with 36 INC on Taco


[17-Oct-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	good lord.  how much of that are you using vs. selling?


[17-Oct-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Wow


[17-Oct-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	how are you even supplying 36 INCs all running the GRN/HCP/MAI recipe?


[17-Oct-24 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Must be absolute logistical insanity.


[17-Oct-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	lol he has 300 days around and has been alot in government... i think they have it figured out


[17-Oct-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	KAWA is kind of like BEN's own federal government haha


[17-Oct-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	meh i don't really understand what that means... i'm just here to grow some trees


[17-Oct-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	maybe touch a bit of grass


[17-Oct-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i do see they were 7x govern of prox which i don't think is too small an achievement


[17-Oct-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	No, it isn't. KAWA runs a lot of major planets in the BEN region.


[17-Oct-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nemesis, Proxion, Katoa.


[17-Oct-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Just to name a couple.


[18-Oct-24 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	KAWA is running/supplying over a dozen planets


[18-Oct-24 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And that much C is a nightmare to ship....buying my 4th ship soon as 3 aren't cutting it


[18-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	All of my C is for sale...within KAWA :)


[18-Oct-24 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Within KAWA, I am not shipping everything myself or might need a 5th ship LOL


[18-Oct-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	like i said...simple farmer with the head in the dirt... my plants are my everything... the government is not of my concern... so long as it keeps functioning and is smoove

[20-Oct-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jaymeson**:	I'll have spare shipping capacity to BEN departing on Sunday each week for a bit; anticipating 400t / 400m3 of available space. Post an ad in LM if you're interested

[29-Oct-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	600 PIO in total


[29-Oct-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	Hey peoples


[20-Nov-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	PIO getting dangerously low. And couple of us from FIOC are settling the planet in the next couple days.


[20-Nov-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If anyone has the gov on discord, could they ping them to let them know?


[20-Nov-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	If people settled and expanded just before POPR they would be okay for workers


[20-Nov-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	What would you like us to do?


[20-Nov-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We're settling 3 new bases. We're looking at needing 3000 or so PIO pops. Current availability is ~750 if my numbers are correct.


[20-Nov-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	3000? In one week? Not a hope...


[20-Nov-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	maybe FIOC could fund a few festivals?


[20-Nov-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. I'm not saying this'll get done in a single week. I'm just giving you a heads up that there's PIO demand incoming so you can maybe run a program and increase the number of Safety Station levels being utilized.


[20-Nov-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And we can absolutely pay for any program.


[21-Nov-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Immigration boosts 500/week


[21-Nov-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, I mean it's either that or festivities. But festivities would bring up all the other pops as well, of which we already have too many.


[21-Nov-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Thought I suppose if we don't fill the other popi infrastructure, might work better.


[21-Nov-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Just gotta get the current level of the ST raised to 4 to get that happiness up.


[21-Nov-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	The PIOs seem pretty happy already. We can probably do another immigration program


[21-Nov-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, almost at 70%. But did I am telling you up front we about to need another 3k of them more or less.


[21-Nov-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I am more than happy to pay for the additional cost, but please, let's try and maximize the PIO increase for next report.


[21-Nov-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Whatever you need financially, just let me know.


[21-Nov-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's more than possible to get 3k PIO for next POPR, it's literally just a matter of acting sooner rather than later.


[21-Nov-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Three new bases in a week, all wanting a huge population is a bit much for a small planet that doesn't see much change from one month to the next. What is the hurry?


[21-Nov-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	archiel's spreedsheet is a little confusing sometimes, but if i'm reading it right,  getting those extra two safety stations plugged in will be the most cost effective way to increase PIO population


[21-Nov-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it will about double the weekly upkeep costs, but will bring in almost 1500 new pioneers


[21-Nov-24 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's not about there being a huge rush. It is just clearly possible to up happiness to bring in more pops for this upcoming next report. I am offering to pay for the additional expenses. So I do not see why you/we wouldn't do it. And it's not such a small planet. 40k pops is not nothing.


[21-Nov-24 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Also remember the POPI changes are averaged over 4 weeks


[21-Nov-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Currently 713 available PIO and 1298 SET


[21-Nov-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Is it total of 3 bases, 3000 PIO or another 3 after that too?


[21-Nov-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	No, total is around 3000 PIO.


[21-Nov-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	ok


[21-Nov-24 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Bit more. But at that point, we'd get them in the same popr probably.


[21-Nov-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Well according to the spreadsheet, enabling the other 2 SST will result in a total available PIO of 2486 next report


[21-Nov-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Happiness already over 70% from what i see


[21-Nov-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Think it was like 69.x or something like that.


[21-Nov-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	going from 2 to 4 in SST....and covering OFF in INF


[21-Nov-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	68.5 with 2 SST


[21-Nov-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Don't think we need anything in the INF. Isn't that just for SET?


[21-Nov-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	No it is for all population


[21-Nov-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Oooh, didn't know that.


[21-Nov-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Health is 6000 and safety is 10000


[21-Nov-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yeah it is SUPER complicated


[21-Nov-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I thought healthy was only for SET though.


[21-Nov-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And safety for PIO.


[21-Nov-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	thankfully once a person learns the levers to flip in the spreadsheet, all sorts of scenarios are possible


[21-Nov-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	no, sorry


[21-Nov-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	even Culture affects PIO


[21-Nov-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	just a lot lower %


[21-Nov-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Archiel's spreadsheet is the only place i know of with the info....and lots of details in there to make it work


[21-Nov-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	as you know, i do this on a lot of planets :)


[21-Nov-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And I still have things to learn LOL


[21-Nov-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. I know of Archiel's SS. I'll have to take a more thorough look.


[21-Nov-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	DM me questions or pick a parliament chat :)


[21-Nov-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But then yeah, if we can get OFF in the INF and open up the 2 other levels of the safety station, that would probably get us plenty of pops.


[21-Nov-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	more PIO on Pyrgos shouldn't be hard at all....and that 2498 is without running a program, it is "free"


[21-Nov-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Might still take 2 POPR, especially since we're burning daylight here with only 4 days left until the next POPR pretty much.


[21-Nov-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	@MR. Guv'na


[21-Nov-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I am not in parliament so I can't make a motion to up SST....and I don't have mats here for upkeep


[21-Nov-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, no worries. Neither do I.


[21-Nov-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And it's days away from BEN if nobody else has OFF either.


[21-Nov-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But honestly, I'd be happy to pay for festivals and whatever it cost to temporarily open up the last two levels of the safety station.


[21-Nov-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I don't really understanding the governor's resistance to it


[21-Nov-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	for 11k, run festival 1 and new PIO becomes 4619 available this week


[21-Nov-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Without increasing the STS?


[21-Nov-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Just on its own?


[21-Nov-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	along with 4 SST and filling OFF in INF....and you can fill the OFF


[21-Nov-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Aah


[21-Nov-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	i can look at Festival by itself....


[21-Nov-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, I would fill OFF if I had any.


[21-Nov-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	festival 2 by itself for 22k will get 3913 available PIO


[21-Nov-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's a no brainer


[21-Nov-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	of course that assumes everything is steady-state and always full for 4+ previous weeks


[21-Nov-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	the rolling average thing and relative change in happiness from unemployment i don't see 100% handled in spreadsheet....but still is 99% of what anybody needs to run a planet


[21-Nov-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, can see that.


[21-Nov-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	@Wildgardner. Please run Fest III. I will pay you whatever it costs.


[21-Nov-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I am happy to share what I know....advantages to being up to my ears in parliaments :)


[21-Nov-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	May as well run 3, can't hurt to have a little cushion.


[21-Nov-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Fest 2....I wouldn't do Fest 3 as too much available workers screws with happiness


[21-Nov-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I try to not have a roller coaster....not about cost but a challenge to find steady-state


[21-Nov-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well if we're using 3k+ of them. Having an extra thousand or something would only be like 2-4% unemployment.


[21-Nov-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not even


[21-Nov-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	well i would bump up the SST to 4....that is "free" and probably needed to maintain these extra bases anyways


[21-Nov-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	that keeps PIO coming in


[21-Nov-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That works for me.


[21-Nov-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Now to convince the governor.


[21-Nov-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	but there are 3-4 ways to do this :)


[21-Nov-24 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	well it is anybody in parliament, governor is only special in that they are the tie-breaker on votes


[21-Nov-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Maybe you could reach out to wickskiracer


[21-Nov-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	See if he can start a motion.


[21-Nov-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Or motions for the STS and Fest II


[21-Nov-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	Fest works the same no matter when you start it, right?


[21-Nov-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	This is part of my C machine to get to second place in C production....so very important :)


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nice.


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I believe so, but I am not 100% sure


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You're on Taco I assume?


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	oh yeah


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nemesis too?


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Nemesis and Pyrgos feed Taco


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Gotcha


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	GRN probably best on Pyrgos, and the HCP and MAI on Nemesis


[21-Nov-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	6 bases that make C and gov upkeep


[21-Nov-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yes i don't do GRN on Nemesis....do all 3 here


[21-Nov-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ooh


[21-Nov-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	not much HCP or MAI here, but Nemesis can't do enough when I also extract H2O


[21-Nov-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	shipping is a nightmare


[21-Nov-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well if you're running a full base on INCs on Taco, you need crap tons of agri stuff. About 4 bases worth total.


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Including the INC base


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Taco isn't full....only have 4 ships


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, the logistics is a nightmare.


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But if it's essentially all you're doing, it's doable.


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	have 30 INC and adding 6 more


[21-Nov-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nice


[21-Nov-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	well i am governor on 7 planets....so that takes a few trips


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We thought about doing something on Taco. GRN base on Prox, and 2 HYF bases plus the INC base on Taco.


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	and stock all gov upkeep for KAWA


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But hauling out 600C/d kind of put a halt to that plan.


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I do GRN on Prox but that is for RAT


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yeah i will be doing 700 C/day


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	maybe more if i get a 5th ship


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	the C production can pay for a ship in less than a month


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. It's an enormous amount of C.


[21-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Need 2 WCBs just hauling out the C practically


[21-Nov-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	1 ship does 1000 C


[21-Nov-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. But the trip to BEN is like a day.


[21-Nov-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And we're not even talking the agri stuff. You can only haul in like 3d worth of HCP and MAI per ship. No mention of GRN there either.


[21-Nov-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	oh i know :)


[21-Nov-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I pay for some shipping....was doing 500 C/day with 3 ships


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. If you can, may be worth teaming up with some corp mates. Have them build HYFs on taco directly.


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Reduces the logistical requirements infinitely.


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Only need to haul in GRN.


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And I bet the same ships hauling out C could just pickup GRN on the way back.

[22-Nov-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	So running Immigration or Festival 2?  And what about 4 SST?


[22-Nov-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Festival 2 and changing to 4 SST gets this done in one week per the spreadsheet


[22-Nov-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Immigration


[22-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	changing to level 4 doubles the input. Been there, done that, got the tee-shirt, and then everyone who wanted it last time pushed off leaving high unemployment and a high weekly input of resources for me to supply


[22-Nov-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I am happy to pay whatever the cost is. Want 500k? I'll send you 500k.


[22-Nov-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Pulling teeth this is like, really.


[22-Nov-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Up STS to 4, run Fest 2. That'll get us our pops and a little on the top. I will PAY YOU for doing so. You lose absolutely nothing. And I am totally find if you want to raise taxes to cover the additional cost of the planet.


[22-Nov-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Guess I don't see it that way @Wildgardener based on the 7 planets I am running.  Maybe the SST drops back down to 3 or other adjustments are made...plus adjusting taxes


[22-Nov-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Seems pretty nice to get advance notice of bases being dropped /shrug


[22-Nov-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also, with 2 more SSTs, you might not need to supply them to the same level as before (once a steady-state has been reached)

[22-Nov-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	@Wildgardner. I am sorry, but if you are unwilling to accommodate new bases going up on a planet you are supposed to be governing, when it would not only cost you nothing, but you would actually make money seeing as I offered more cash than the programs and new materials would cost, then you leave little choice for us but to run for government with the intent of putting in a government that is actually willing to support the local player-base and population.


[22-Nov-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Well lets also not rush to discard a person that has been supporting this planet for 22 months.  But yes we do need every planet to support the player bases with the best tools available.  I don't care who runs the parliament, it just needs to be effective in meeting player needs whoever is elected


[22-Nov-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Agreed.


[22-Nov-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I don't mean to discard anyone. But from where I'm standing, I cannot explain to myself why he wouldn't run the program at the very least. I'm offering cash, more than he needs, a lot more. The only explanation I can think of is that he doesn't want us to get the PIO we need to staff our bases. For what reason? I have no idea.


[22-Nov-24 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	It's definitely not like that, Wildgardener has been running Pyrgos for longer than I've been playing, there's nothing malicious about wanting to do things the way that they've always been done. I think more of a conversation is due before jumping to just taking over. @wildgardener the offer stands that people who want their populations faster than 2-3 weeks are willing to put up the money, matierals, and shipping to make it happen. They did the math already, all you have to do is pass the motions. They get their workers faster, and Pyrgos is left with more money in it's coffers than when they arrived. The only thing more to offer is to pass the motions too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If you don't want to deal with all of it I think it's fair for TA and Silent to run for parilament, do the work, dump some money into the coffers, then leave you to keep doing your thing. But that still delays people's workforce growth by a week.


[22-Nov-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	TAfirehawk is right, running a festival program and temporarily increasing active SST level will get workers faster. Doens't have to be a pernament increase to upkeep, it's just faster than immigration programs


[22-Nov-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	also pretty sure it's cheaper than immigration programs but idk


[23-Nov-24 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Wow that's a fee


[23-Nov-24 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Oh sweet, peaceful Pyrgos, what will become of you? Once a quiet sleepy backwater, but alas no more...


[23-Nov-24 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I mean, why so much?


[23-Nov-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I feel a de ja vu, I've already seen that on Verdant half a year ago


[23-Nov-24 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Unfortunately somebody, somewhere on Pyrgos will be p*ssed whatever I do


[23-Nov-24 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It just feels unrelated and too high of a fee


[23-Nov-24 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Especially when people have literally offered you to cover all the government expenses related to getting new population


[23-Nov-24 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Not that I'm pissed or anything, I don't even use warehouse yet


[23-Nov-24 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Although I am willing to contribute into it


[23-Nov-24 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It just doesn't look... relevant, I dunno


[23-Nov-24 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I haven't touched local market fees. They are still 0


[23-Nov-24 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That is cool, I make a heavy use of those :D


[23-Nov-24 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Although I wouldn't mind having some low fees there


[23-Nov-24 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	The warehouse fees will fund warehouse expansion


[23-Nov-24 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I can give some mats in, if only somebody will haul them from MOR :D


[23-Nov-24 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Dont have a shipping capacity here yet


[23-Nov-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Even on planets like Katoa hehe, WAR fees only add up to like 30k a week.


[23-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Doesn't affect me either as I don't rent the WAR here. But even if you kept the current usage, you'd be making 19,000 a week. It would take months to upgrade the WAR at that rate. If you need fabs, I'll see what I can do to haul some in from BEN on my next trip out here.


[23-Nov-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yeah I don't understand the WH fee either....guess Pyrgos isn't ran like any other planet I am associated with


[23-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	its 70$ a day while a decent base makes 50k$/d at least, debate about PIOs or whatever but the warehouse fees really dont matter lol


[23-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	from someone who uses it decently often


[23-Nov-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah I don't think taxes are the issue, if there's a deficit then by all means raise taxes. I think the original issue is growing population for new bases faster, and that seems more important. lost revenue from missing workforce is so much more expensive than taxes could ever be


[23-Nov-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	also, all materials to upgrade WH to lvl 7 are in their way, free because I use WH here and like this planet. would love to see more activity here and an LCB worth of WH storage would be great for that I think


[23-Nov-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	true, this is the one planet where a big warehouse makes a difference to me


[23-Nov-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	cause a STO would be too expensive


[23-Nov-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	The increase in taxes will be to pay for increased cost of upkeep. Currently my corp produces and supplies everything that's needed. Increasing SS to level four is beyond what we can comfortably supply. That is why I've always favoured slow and steady growth.


[23-Nov-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	just the 2 SSTs might be enough to maintain pop, the 3 SSTs is just temporary to get more workers fast for these new bases.


[23-Nov-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	also: you're currently filling 2 materials in 2 SSTs, you could activate all 4 and only fill one material, which could be even cheaper depending on how much your OFF/DW costs you


[24-Nov-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Nov-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Maybe because I've been stupidly financially supporting it for the past 22 terms in office?


[26-Nov-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Nov-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Haha. Well Pyrgos is growing pretty big. COGC costs go up, popi upkeep cost goes up, everything goes up with more pops. I'm not against raising taxes. But if you wanted to keep the planet free, we'd be happy to supply some inputs. KAWA also brought out thousands of OFF as well just recently.


[26-Nov-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**isherwood**:	Anyone going to BEN with space to spare? I have a 100t shipment to go. Ad posted on the LM.


[28-Dec-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Hello good people of Pyrgos. If you haven't already noticed... warehouse rental fees on Pyrgos have been reduced to 100 per unit. It is pure coincidence that there is an election on at the moment!

[28-Dec-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**isherwood**:	I make supply runs from Katoa to Pyrgos every 7-10 days and I always have extra space. Post shipping ad on Benten LM if interested.


[12-Jan-25 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my shipping ad is still active on the benten LM


[12-Jan-25 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I have one there too


[12-Jan-25 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	I don't go to BEN that regularly (better prices on the ANT CX are usually worth the trip for me). I was talking shipping from Katoa.


[12-Jan-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	your message was a little confusing, then, because you said to post ads on benten,


[12-Jan-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	Oh, yeah, my bad. I have actually never looked at BEN's LM, but given that there are many shipping ads, I'll make a point of working it into my schedule in the future.


[12-Jan-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i can post ads on katoa LM too :)


[12-Jan-25 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	I would definitely see those.

[22-Jan-25 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralGorgeous**:	Leaving Benten Station for Pyrgos in 12h with 324t/361m3 free space (and already everything from @bobnobrain ;D). Cheap shipping!!!


[22-Jan-25 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yay!


[22-Jan-25 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	@GeneralGorgeous contract sent if it's not too late


[22-Jan-25 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	Could I respectfully request more PIO pops @wildgardner?


[01-Feb-25 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	A program, or adding OFF to the SST perhaps.


[01-Feb-25 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Yes, I'm sure we can sort something out


[01-Feb-25 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Much appreciated! Let me know if you would like reimbursement for anything. Reason I ask is we just had another RIG base go up and the planet is short a few hundred pops to fill the base unless PIO pops grow next POPR

**Rwinner16**:	What make ssome of our names green vs gray

[03-Apr-25 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Not so far if you're based in Gibson


[03-Apr-25 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Still a bit far, especially when Proxion exists :)


[03-Apr-25 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah but pyrgos has good water and even better soil than proxion


[03-Apr-25 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Also true


[03-Apr-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Much better water!


[03-Apr-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	If you make fuel and have plenty of ships, distance is no problem...


[03-Apr-25 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-25 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-25 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	like BEN is the best setup for agri with Prox NEM and KW-020d after that Pyrgos and Verdant come

[19-Apr-25 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoffeeCupMassacre**:	I see a shpt load of orders on the LM to BEN, is there a lot of takers on hauling between here and BEN?


[19-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoffeeCupMassacre**:	*are there


[20-Apr-25 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I don't think many people have much space heading back to Benton, so I imagine there aren't many takers.


[20-Apr-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	I usually run a 2k/2k ship up here and will take stuff to BEN iff I have space. The current ads have a 10day delivery time which helps me to plan and lock in the freight to guarantee a full return trip. I would not send up a ship unless it comes back full. Same for stuff going from BEN to Pyrgos. Long delivery times for the win.
