**Mumzhar**:	Welcome new Harmonians! There is a discord channel for Antares and Harmonia residents to ask questions and coordinate: https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP


[27-Sep-21 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	One of the projects requiring coordination is the Chamber of Global Commerce (CoGC) which can provide 10% to 25% efficiency bonus in exchange for a weekly upkeep and a large upfront cost. This upfront cost is being taken of right now, thanks to cash donations from ANTS corp, lfabs bought from QWNE corp and electronics made by FIO corp paid with a loan from Deimos government.


[27-Sep-21 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	While a CoGC bonus can be applied to any population tier or any production sector, and ultimately will depend on votes (PRO required), the preferred choice would be to boost Agriculture by 25%. Most local production will benefit from it directly or indirectly (crops, basic rations, carbon, etc.). This is something than can be discussed on Discord (see link above) and you are welcome to add your opinion to the discussion.


[27-Sep-21 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	Lastly, the loan from Deimos government will have to paid back at some point. One option would be to provide the basic rations (RAT) for Deimos CoGC upkeep until the debt is paid off, which would be about 2500 RAT over the next 6-8 weeks (200k AIC total). With a +25% bonus on agriculture, this is reachable without additional costs if enough people participate. If you want to participate and have PRO licence, please reach out to me in the next few weeks to transfer the RAT and I will drop them off directly on Deimos. If you want to do it yourself, please notify Slomes these contributions are part of the Harmonia debt.


[27-Sep-21 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	For those without PRO, if you want to contribute locally, we also will need to provide for the local CoGC upkeep. And as we do not have an administration center nor a governor, we will have to contribute it by ourselves.

**Yogitus**:	Hey all


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yogitus**:	RE: CoGC, how can I help as a pretty casual, basic player living on Harmonia?


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yogitus**:	I can't produce much, but I'd be happy to set aside what I can while I work to expand


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	once it's built up (in a few days) there will be a weekly upkeep of DW, RAT, PE and MCG scaled to the population of Harmonia


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	as all taxes currently go into a void (as we can't have a governor without an administration center), this upkeep will have to rely on donations for now


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	and there are more term benefits to a CoGC bonus than building an administration center


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	short-term*


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yogitus**:	Okay. So donating some basic goods. I can do that. What is the total needed for the weekly upkeep?


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	it will depends on the population and change every week


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	on Deimos, 300 to 700 of each are needed every week


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	and Deimos has double the population of Harmonia


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	the most helpful you can do right now is to expand your base though


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yogitus**:	okay.


[28-Sep-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yogitus**:	Well in that case, I'll sell you RATS and DW for your donations... ;D

**juzek14**:	CoGC scales linearly with number of players, take all plots - available plots - #infrastructure buildings *4 is MCG and PE, *3 is DW, *2 is RAT


[29-Sep-21 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**juzek14**:	so about 200 RAT, 300 DW, 400 PE/MCG

[01-Nov-21 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	new player waves directly impact material availability and prices. Bfabs are the first to be hit, then consumables.


[01-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tuatha**:	well its rude


[01-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	try to sell RAT/DW just below large sellers and wait for buyers: almost everybody needs RATs and DWs


[01-Nov-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tuatha**:	well i wasnt selling rat atm anyway. just trying to expand a few facilities.


[01-Nov-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Nov-21 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	Hello Harmonians!  As you may have noticed, we now have our own Planetary Administration Center (ADM). This was mainly done thanks to [ANTS] Scorus | EXS and my contributions. The main goals are to capture the tax money currently lost to the Antares Initiative (non-player corporation) and allow local rules to be altered.


[06-Nov-21 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	By the same occasion, I will also announce I'm running for the governor position of Harmonia, now that elections are possible.


[06-Nov-21 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	My starting goals are simple:


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- capture tax money instead of losing it to Antares Initiative.


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- minimum taxes on Local Market and Warehouse (we don't have a WAR yet) to help local trade


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- feed Harmonia CoGC


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- keep on the promise previously made to repay Harmonia CoGC to Deimos government in the form of RAT and DW to Deimos CoGC (about 150k AIC worth remain, out of the initial 286k), now using DW and RAT bought from Harmonians instead of relying on donations.


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- pay back the ADM electronics bought by Scorus (150k CIS)


[06-Nov-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	- if there is still tax money left, lower production taxes


[06-Nov-21 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	You are welcome to discuss all of this on the community Discord: https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP (then !join antares !join harmonia)


[06-Nov-21 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'd like to recommend that taxes not be used to pay off the purchase of materials for the ADM.  I just feel weird being forced to give money to players who spent that money on something to force me to give money to them.


[06-Nov-21 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	If you wanted an ADM, great, but I don't see why we should pay for it.


[06-Nov-21 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	you would prefer to pay taxes to the void and get nothing in return?


[06-Nov-21 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Yes


[06-Nov-21 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I just dont think that the lost taxes are that bad :shrug:


[06-Nov-21 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	spending half a mil to make an ADM is a lot, seems like putting that towards say... drone production and selling drones to MM would generate more money than the taxes will


[06-Nov-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	someone generating lots of money doesn't make them responsible to provide POPI upkeep in time, ADM does (via governor and taxes). It's not about money.

**-Kosta-**:	Did Mumzhar just double the production fees? Or quadrupled? They seem to be way higher than before, and not sustainable.


[09-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	thats still the base rate


[09-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	he just changed them to drop in his hands instead of the void


[09-Nov-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	and local market fees and warehouse (which does not exist yet) fees have been lowered


[09-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	production fees are proportional to the default production time, with 20 AIC per 24 hour cycle by default. The available range is 5 to 120 AIC.


[09-Nov-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Kosta-**:	Hmm... I was ready to swear that at least FRM rates were lower before...


[09-Nov-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	are you using the inimal order size?


[09-Nov-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	minimal*


[09-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Kosta-**:	Btw, I am going to need to fly from Harmonia to Antares Station half-empty (3/4 empty) within next 2-3 days. If anyone wants stuff to be delivered there, please let me know, I'll deliver your stuff :)


[09-Nov-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Kosta-**:	@Mumzhar I use different sizes, mostly 2x and 3x minimal, why?


[09-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	tax is proportional, so if you switched from 1x to 2x or 3x, displayed tax will be 2x or 3x but you will still pay the same amount per unit


[09-Nov-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Kosta-**:	I understand that :)


[09-Nov-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	ok :)


[09-Nov-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	I'm just trying to understand where double/quadruple amounts would come from, as the rate is the same as before


[09-Nov-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Kosta-**:	I just looked at FRM fees, and they seemed way higher than before, at least 2x. However, I have not written down what were the fees before the change, so it's possible that they haven't changed and I just imagining things :)


[09-Nov-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	tbh


[09-Nov-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jan-22 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

Harmonia job report bug
I think Harmonia lost workers instead of gaining them. It says change 1,720 but I figure we actually lost 9,480

[06-Feb-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gidoran**:	You should have started with two ships in your fleet


[24-May-22 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gidoran**:	you fly them to the commodity exchange, buy and sell your stuff, and then fly back. Takes a while.

**Churaviis**:	For the one that's been providing the upkeep to keep your pioneers happy


[17-Jun-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	Ok I voted for you :P


[17-Jun-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	I hope you can keep it up with our taxes


[17-Jun-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	And buy what you need from the local market


[17-Jun-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Thanks, I appreciate it, you rock for being civically involved


[17-Jun-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I make the manufactured goods myself but I will be buying local DW and RAT for sure


[17-Jun-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	I don't mind paying more in taxes as long as the local market buys are competitive or above average


[17-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	Hopefully it will be a positive cycle :P


[17-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Because I make upkeep myself I shouldn't need to raise taxes much if at all


[17-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	I'm just starting out, so still building up my production


[17-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	Making RATs atm and when I get surplus cash I'll probably buy water to make DW


[17-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You've picked a good planet to start on


[17-Jun-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	Yeah I had no idea about the game at all when I started


[17-Jun-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kitaru**:	I just picked the food job because I figured there would always be demand, and I picked this faction because I figured there would be less food production :P


[17-Jun-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	There is a high demand for rations, it's only recently come down so it's probably a good choice


[17-Jun-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	There's also a high demand for carbon so there's lots of ads to buy agricultural products that can be burned to make it

[17-Jun-22 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceGravy**:	Newbie here, just workin to get the basics of RAT/DW operation up and running. Would it make sense to aim towards buying an Incinerator and Material Plant to be able to produce OVE?


[17-Jun-22 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's good to stick to 2 or 3 industries so that you can stack experts. Incinerators are resource extraction so it's a good combo to have RIG's to pull water for FRM's to make burnables for INC. That's only two industries and C is in high demand now


[17-Jun-22 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Your 3rd and 4th expert add more efficience than the first two


[17-Jun-22 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceGravy**:	Got it. So maybe add an INC for C down the road, but no need to go all the way and get a BMP when I can just sell the C outright.


[17-Jun-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Exactly, Also if you wait to save up for a base on Hephaestus then you can get their CoGC bonus of 25% for manufacturing, that's big


[17-Jun-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceGravy**:	Thanks friend.


[17-Jun-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**tuxdelux**:	So I would be up for selling a steady - although small amount at first - steam of a resource in order to get some other resource from someone with extra, such as RAT for Carbon


[06-Jul-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	You can start by putting a sell ad up on LM for a bit less than CX; I'm sure people can use OVE any time.


[06-Jul-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tuxdelux**:	It would help me get going to have someone buy a few overalls for the market price, which I just posted.


[06-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Looks like someone got it


[06-Jul-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tuxdelux**:	Thank goodness... I needed some cash.. I am happy to post more if anyone wants some


[06-Jul-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Try to keep an ad posted (list it for a few days duration at a time); you can repost as long as you have inventory if someone buys.


[06-Jul-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tuxdelux**:	Good thinking. Thanks


[06-Jul-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Glad to help. There are always lots of ads up for buying burnables from various people.


[06-Jul-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Also remember that although our LM fees are comparable to most planets, they can still eat into profits for small batch sales as compared to the CX which has no fee.

[10-Jul-22 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-22 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**timjessie**:	ok


[10-Jul-22 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**timjessie**:	i just started and am making carbon it takes two days to complet


[10-Jul-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	This game is about analyzing and planning. It's a game where you spend an hour or two making a plan and then go play other games while the plan is being carried out, just checking in every so often


[10-Jul-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**timjessie**:	ok


[10-Jul-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**timjessie**:	thx


[10-Jul-22 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	With carbon, it is only the cheaper recipes that take super long. You'll need to decide whether the more expensive but faster recipes are worth it. Usually if you grow enough crops the more expensive recipes will be worth it, especially with the price of carbon so high.


[10-Jul-22 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**timjessie**:	right know im making Hydrocarbon Plants into carbon


[10-Jul-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	I've been burning the expensive carbon recipe since day 1. With 2 FRM to 1 INC you can pretty much keep up the fast burn 24/7 and it makes quite a bit of $


[11-Jul-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Carbon is one of the slowest products in the game to make; not a very good starter profession according to most.

[13-Jul-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jul-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexxicon**:	Yeah, I mean I for sure want to sub; but I'm also expecting to be afk for like up to four months soon, so it's hard to decide to sub now

**Lord_Trochalus**:	How do you see which building uses how many workers?


[21-Jul-22 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AnthonyAbney**:	If you hit construct, it will show under "workforce" for the building you want.


[21-Jul-22 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AnthonyAbney**:	Farmstead requires 50 pioneers

**danielvin**:	or the buyer?


[16-Aug-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	to station or to local market.  Need pro license for selling on local market i think.  most if not all starting planets have local markets.


[16-Aug-22 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you don't have pro the CX is your only option. Even if you do have pro, the CX is still usually your best option


[16-Aug-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	curious if anyone here needs a supply of C?


[16-Aug-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	that's what I'm gearing up for.


[16-Aug-22 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	C is in high demand, you will easily find buyers, more if you transport it to Deimos


[17-Aug-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	so where's Deimos?


[17-Aug-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	how do you even find that. looks like I need to know the catalog ID


[17-Aug-22 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You can use the map or open up a new buffer and type "PLI" hit enter, then the name of the planet


[17-Aug-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you don't have pro, however, the only place you'll be able to sell or buy anything is at the Antares CX


[17-Aug-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	cool thanks


[17-Aug-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	wish Deimos had been a starting option :/  lol


[17-Aug-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	not that i ncessarily would have known that it was popular there


[17-Aug-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	but i also like to help the locals, so i was just checking to see if anyone here wanted like a constant supply or something.


[17-Aug-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	but i guess that's what the local market is for  haha. and i see ppl want it  soooo  jsut gotta get my production levels up

[17-Aug-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	cool thanks


[17-Aug-22 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SeraphX2**:	do you have to queue that one up as well or does it just happen since it's a base material?


[17-Aug-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Aug-22 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	you buy pro to get P and then take contracts to go from there


[19-Aug-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	contracts are paid features only?


[19-Aug-22 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Yes, to prevent people from making free accounts just to give starter resources to their main account, accounts that have paid at least once can buy/sell directly with other players


[19-Aug-22 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Even with pro, most stuff you buy or sell will still be on the CX

**RiseofFilth**:	What happened to Churviis?


[05-Sep-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	Churaviis is looking to govern another planet, so I offered to take the reigns from him and keep Harmonia up and running


[05-Sep-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Well if you see him before i do, tell him thats dumb and i miss him


[05-Sep-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Sadly I will not be running as other obligations prevent me from doing so but I am consoled by the fact that I have a very capable replace in Erix_123 who I know will do a good job and will certainly continue to recieve support from me and the rest of OBCM


[05-Sep-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	We will give full support to Erix so that the transition will be smooth, which is actually pretty easy as Harm is in a pretty good shape.

**Churaviis**:	I always leave a place better than I found it

**Dyncommon**:	go slow?


[05-Sep-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you have pro, put up a buy ad on the LM, otherwise you may need to COLIQ


[05-Sep-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	im probably just going to buy pro and put up and ad


[05-Sep-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Figure out some base planning when you get to the point where you have nothing else to do. Also ask questions on Discord; people can help a lot.


[06-Sep-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Don't sell all your STL fuel unless you have to; you'll be using a lot more fuel when you start to run back and forth to the CX than you will later, because you'll have to go without full loads.


[06-Sep-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	and if your pro, take a look at the 2 10k contracts I have put up


[06-Sep-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you plan things out right, you won't need to make very many trips to the CX


[06-Sep-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	perhaps


[06-Sep-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Lots of waiting though, not as good a growth curve

**Churaviis**:	Capacity is the number of beds available for workers, current workforce is how many workers are currently working in jobs right now. You increase capacity by building habitations, which can be found in the infrastructure tab of the construction buffer

**Dehzhas**:	I'm looking for someone who has 80k AIC and is interested in experimenting with loan mechanics. Basically, you give me 80k, I give you 15k a week for 8 weeks (120k total). I would prefer them to have a base on Harmonia as it makes trading the payment contracts easier.

**tinblue**:	I've settled into a routine of producing GRN, BEA, VEG and WATER to produce DW and RAT's. I also built a Collector to get Oxygen. I've recently spend money to increase my pioneer hab from 200 to 300 in preparation. But in preparation for what I don't know lol. Where would one normally expand next? Should I increase my farmstead output buy building another farm? What is the most common next step for me on Harmonia?


[26-Sep-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	If you already have the supply chain built to sell DW and RAT you can just expand that to build more faster.


[26-Sep-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If your base isn't full, you could expand RAT production. Of course O is very pricey right now, so that could be a very profitable option for a while. You can always get the fabs back when O falls again.


[26-Sep-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Helainty**:	do you know when the universe reset is going to take place?


[26-Sep-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	No one knows. Shouldn't be for a long time from what I understand.


[26-Sep-22 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Basically there will probably be one more reset before the official game launch, but that is still a bit off.


[26-Sep-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Helainty**:	and the official game launch, somebody know more or less when will it be?


[26-Sep-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	There hasn't been an announcement about any plans there as far as I know. The roadmap is here https://prosperousuniverse.com/roadmap/ (planned work at the bottom). There is a lot of that left and the end game sill needs a bit of work, so I don't think it will be any time soon.

[26-Sep-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dehzhas**:	I'm offering regular weekly local contracts for DW and RAT. You reserve an X amount per week and I send you a contract payable within 1 day and I deliver by the end of the week. Price will be current market rate (avg of current ask and bid on the market). Anything I can't produce I will buy and deliver locally by the end of the week. I pay shipping, run the logistics, pricing risk, etc. You just consume the DW and RAT in guaranteed amounts. Cancel at the end of any week or adjust the amount as you scale. If interested dm me.


[26-Sep-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zymgie**:	Greetings Harmonians! I'm a slightly late candidate for your Governorship and saying hi here.


[04-Oct-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	You can read my pitch on the Discord #harmonia-politics channel, but in case you aren't there ...


[04-Oct-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I've been on Harmonia for 578ish days, as the original settler. It's my first and favorite home!


[04-Oct-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I'm committed to doing the job and have the illustrious Mumzhar in my corp as a mentor to ensure I do it right.


[04-Oct-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	And I'm pretty active. Just not in-game chat, since the notifications in here leave a lot to be desired.


[04-Oct-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	Hello to all Harmonians as well! This is the incumbent governor for Harmonia and I'm seeking re-election. As Zymgie shared, I also highly encourage you to look at the pitches on the discord channel


[04-Oct-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	My short hand pitch is that my corporation has been the steward of this planet for the previous 4 cycles and are committed to ensuring the prosperity of all on this planet, a goal I put at the top of my priorities.

[05-Oct-22 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	maybe someone knows about a way to upgrade ships


[05-Oct-22 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	all i know is use more fuel to go faster


[05-Oct-22 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Early in the game you just need to use more fuel to go faster. You can adjust the sliders to see how much fuel you are going to use. Be aware that there are diminishing returns to using more fuel to go faster and it isn't always worth it.


[05-Oct-22 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	You can upgrade ships, but it is very expensive

[11-Oct-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You put it on a ship and send that ship the the ANT Common Exchange


[11-Oct-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	The CXL button on the left brings up a menu with all the CXs. Antares Station Commodity Exchange (AI1 or ANT) is the closest one.

**Ragadais**:	But how do you decide which carbon recipe to use if you don't have a spreadsheet?


[21-Oct-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Making spreadsheets is half the fun of the game


[21-Oct-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Short term, the faster recipe will make you more money if you can grow the crops yourself. Long term, the slower recipe makes more as you don't need as many farms and, once you max the base out, will make more if your base is setup for it


[21-Oct-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ragadais**:	interesting. I've been using pioneers as my constrained resource, haven't made it far enough to consider space as the limiter.

[23-Jan-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	may i ask a noobie question?


[23-Jan-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	how hard is it to be a part of a corporation? not sure what it entails


[23-Jan-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Corporations mean nothing in this game, other than a shiny tag.


[23-Jan-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	In some cases, it is detrimental to be part of a corp.


[23-Jan-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	oh ok, one more question :)


[23-Jan-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	nothing is gated behind being part of a corp.


[23-Jan-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	A good corp will give you loans or grants and cheaper stuff and help you integrate into a larger production chain


[23-Jan-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	I watched a youtuber and he mentioned financial institutions and loans for starting, whats the logistics behind a loan in a game like this?


[23-Jan-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You don't need to be in a corp to get fantastic help from other players.


[23-Jan-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	noted!


[23-Jan-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	each player has their own requirements on loans. Some have specific repayment terms. Some will give you cash to build specific facilities and then will either buy those goods from you (meaning you get the money upfront AND you don't have to take the goods to the market)


[23-Jan-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	some will want cash repaid on a schedule


[23-Jan-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	some will charge interest. some will not.


[23-Jan-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	also thank you for taking the time to answer my questions fellow planet mates.


[23-Jan-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	take note: there is nothing stopping you from taking loans and then just keeping the money and not fulfilling your side of the bargain. The lender has no in-game mechanics to force you to do anything. You're free to do whatever you want.


[23-Jan-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeliumHunter**:	Of course, if you do that you make an enemy


[23-Jan-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeliumHunter**:	You do not want an enemy


[23-Jan-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeliumHunter**:	/ your reputation being obliterated


[23-Jan-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	*nods* id honor however if i decided to participate


[23-Jan-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	HOWEVER, it's worse than that. Many players (and all the big players) keep track of anyone who has broken a deal, either a loan or contract and not at least tried to come to some arrangement. This game allows a one to Block another player, and if you don't honour your agreements, you will find yourself Blocked by a lot of players.


[23-Jan-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeliumHunter**:	based


[23-Jan-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	yikes


[23-Jan-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Dealing with other players is arguably the 3rd biggest part of this game, after making things and sorting out your logistics.


[23-Jan-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	on the other hand, a lot of players (and I mean, almost all) are really nice and will want to help you when they can.


[23-Jan-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	well that makes me feel good! hah


[23-Jan-23 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeliumHunter**:	If anyone wants to loan me 200,000 AIC i'll make em 50% share holders of a (figurative) gold mine I'm planning on colonising

**AR_Outlaw**:	perfect


[10-Mar-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AR_Outlaw**:	Well it looks like I have to have a pro license to both accept and initiate contracts. I'll have to upgrade sometime soon. I appreciate you being willing to help


[10-Mar-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wingedsubmariner**:	Huh, I thought basic could accept


[10-Mar-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wingedsubmariner**:	I'll post a LM instead, you can accept those


[10-Mar-23 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AR_Outlaw**:	So it looks like I can't do that either because my rating is not sufficient. Which I think it is unrated due to the license.

Prosperous Universe: What is the Best Starting Package? | Pear Talk...
I know a lot of people have got this on their mind, so I made this educational guide video for Prosperous Universe to talk about what is the best starting package in the game. In this video, we dive into the pros and cons of what each starting package does, and what planets make great starts for said starter packages.

**DorianTesla**:	It's not per unit it's depend of the weight/size of what you want to sent. So if you want to send 0.2T it would be 72.84 AIC


[16-Mar-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Between ANT and Harmonia I would ask/charge 5-6 per ton or m3. That gives 2500-3000 per full load


[16-Mar-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	But that's for a partial, depending on space available.


[16-Mar-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DorianTesla**:	I can understand, Numbers like that are profitable. But, are only interesting on full load. Otherwise, a little delivery of PG (I think that's what my number are based with a 0.002T) of 2000 unit, would be a transaction of 20 AIC... Not ready to deal with all the organisation for 2000 AIC on something that would have a value of ~74K on the market XD.


[16-Mar-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DorianTesla**:	2000 Unit* not 2000 AIC on the last sentence

**Chew1e**:	anything ~5 jumps is fine


[18-Mar-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	because it's Chamber of Comerce is set on Manufacturing and it has a decent infrastructure. You don't Mine on Hephaesteus, you concentrate on Manufacturing industries and import everything you need


[18-Mar-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	If you want to Mine, something than go to Deimos, Mine ALO and make AL out of it . Or Nike, ther you can Mine LST and do Construction production.

**Controledfail**:	Why do I see a spike in the DW and ration prices a few months ago? just courious to the future trends.


[19-Mar-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	If you mean about 2 month ago, then it probably was due to someone trying to manipulate the H2O prices, by pushing them up to 60 on all markets


[19-Mar-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	but he either didn't succeed or stoped because of other reasons.


[19-Mar-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	there's been punch of up and down's going on for the last month, H2O as mentioned, then C price shot to roof. And as peeps shifted their focus on those, the unevened supply/demand ratio with RAT's caught us all pants down, as peeps still expanding their bases constantly


[19-Mar-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	also as COF went up too for a moment, which that combined with RAT shortage, shot the DW up as either peeps were making COF (which consumes DW), or just focusing on RAT just in general


[19-Mar-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	so that's my theory on all of that, though it's not that I've got any numbers to back up here on anything :)


[19-Mar-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**babymanu**:	noob question, but can someone explain how the 'equity' in the 'Finance' tab is calculated? I understand the fixed/current/liquid assets, but have no idea what affects the equity of my company


[31-Mar-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	pretty sure its the total of all your assets


[31-Mar-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	@babymanu


[31-Mar-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OniDemo**:	someone correct me if im wrong on that


[31-Mar-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**babymanu**:	ah okay. think i managed to wrap my head around it. My (fixed+current+liquid) assets = equity + total(revenue-expenses)


[31-Mar-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**babymanu**:	and the 'profit carried forward' under the equity section is just profit without including the latest period


[31-Mar-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**babymanu**:	and im assuming 'fixed capital' is just the starting bundle of goods the tutorial starts you off with.


[31-Mar-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Syqel**:	A comma in Europe acts just like a period in the US without the appropriate 'Regional' option programmed into the function so I wouldn't necessarily call it a 'fat fingered' mistake


[05-Apr-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It would still be considered a 'fat fingered' mistake as the term doesn't just refer to mistakes due to large digits but mistakes due to any kind of erroneous input from a person


[05-Apr-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Syqel**:	It's not erroneous input though if the person honestly thought a comma should be there because they live in the US which considers a comma a designation for the thousands


[05-Apr-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NysileVerazi**:	I'd say their intent was correct, but their input was incorrect.

**Figglehort**:	oh thanks


[08-May-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Figglehort**:	i was just looking at everything and it makes me more money to just directly sell MAI, BEA, and NUT than making it into RATs or FIMs


[08-May-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	That depends on whether you can sell it at the high end of the market or the low end. You can only sell it on the high end if you're willing to wait, if you need it right away then you might need to sell it on the low end or lower depending on volumes


[08-May-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Figglehort**:	oh yeah


[08-May-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Figglehort**:	But I'd have to undercut everyone since there's a bunch of people who have been playing longer than me and have tons at a high price


[08-May-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Figglehort**:	unless I make everything myself though rn it's not profitable to buy meat patties and spicy herbs to make FIMs or MEA


[08-May-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-May-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	How much OVE do you consume?


[16-May-23 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Athanaric**:	basicly i went the farmer route


[16-May-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yes, its a good way to start, very profitable and simple.


[16-May-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Athanaric**:	yea i played at the beginning of this wipe as a water farmer, 100% just farmed


[16-May-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Athanaric**:	and all i need is OVE and i can supply myself


[16-May-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yes, plus OVE is dirt cheap


[16-May-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Recommend using at least PWO as soon as you can afford it


[16-May-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	Free accounts cannot accept or create direct contracts or local market ads to prevent multi-account abuse. You'll get to buy pro if you want to fulfill shipping orders from other players.

[18-May-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-May-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Milfyman**:	scratch that, does anyone know if repairing a ship only costs 1 BHP no matter the condition?


[26-May-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	multiply the percentage missing by the total plates the ship needed to be built, which is 48 for the starter ship, and then round up to get the number of plates needed to repair the ship

**Milfyman**:	Thank you


[26-May-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Milfyman**:	Hey, If I complete a shipping contract, can the person choose not to pay me?


[27-May-23 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	they can willingly or by forgetting not klick to fulfill the payment. you can extend the contract in that case & should message the person (maybe they just forgot / oversaw becaus of many contracts, that may happen)


[27-May-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	if they don't respond or respond negativly that is considered pirating and you should warn other players of this person in the UFO discord.

**RiseofFilth**:	its rather uncommon that folks do not, whether needing a reminder or extention, choose to break a contract and not fullfill their portion. It tends to them being blackballed and blocked by the entire community

**Milfyman**:	How do you guys handle shipping contracts? I see some contracts to ship essentially 500t from Harmonia to ANT for 4k. Using the least amount of fuel it costs 440 in ship damage and 2624 in fuel for a total of 3064 round trip. I feel like I am missing something... 1k for a contract that takes 2 days done as cheaply as possible doesn't seem worth it


[30-May-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	It's worth it for some, not for others


[30-May-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-May-23 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Milfyman**:	Is there a way to upgrade the Cargo Bay of the existing starting ship?


[30-May-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Yes, if you have a PRO license. Looks like you are a planet or higher supporter.


[30-May-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Need to go to BLU command and specify your upgraded design


[30-May-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Then you can go to the shipyard and start the project.


[30-May-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	You will need around 1 million to upgrade the starter ship with components from the free market. @Milfyman it might be cheaper knowing producers of the components.

**caskman**:	I raised production fees, you can see the new fees at "LR ZV-896b".  They were originally 5 AIC across the board.  After seeing how much the fees bring in vs the cost of all upkeep I'll eventually be taking a loss of about 27,000 AIC per day.  So I've increased fees but a lesser increase on Agriculture, Food Industries, and Resource Extraction.  This made a lot more sense after looking at the fee structures of a whole bunch of different planets like deimos, phobos, promitor, and so on where they have much higher fees.

[29-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	I don't think ORCs are well suited to Harmonia. The low fertility with the relativly low H2O concentration is a bad combination. there are far better worlds for ORCs.

**agrif**:	but also, consider, this is a starting planet. a lot of people have their first base here and are doing things that don't at all align with what the planet is good at


[30-Jul-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	@agrif I do agree, that as a starter planet people will do things differently, as I also did, when I started here, but ORCs do need A-Fabs to build and the technicians need higher tier consumables so a people starting here will still need to be somewhat advanced to even be able to afford to build and maintain them, by which point I hope they have already figured out, that there are better places. However since there are nevertheless Tecs here on the planet one still may do that. Question is, if Tecs should be a focus and imo they should not be.

**TuffyLess**:	^^ this IMO too.  Demeter to Norwick is 8 jumps while Harmonia to Norwick is 1.  ISA to Harmonia for H2O is 4 jumps.  The fert may not be the best but the jump count to get H2O to the Orc then to the FER-->IVP on Norwick adds up to less than the entire Demeter plan.


[30-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	Curious, is there a reason people wouldn't make IVPs here?


[30-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	It's a Foody BUI.  Harmonia is a Agri CoGC.


[30-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	So building Food Processing here isn't especially recommended?


[30-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I wouldnt ; the CoGC gives +25% to Agri here.


[30-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	That makes sense.  Still on my first base so I'm gonna hybrid until I can get a second one.  What are good places to eye up for a FI base?


[30-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you're starting with one planet, I think it's now awful to build FPs on your FRM planet, but it's probably something to eventually transition away from.


[30-Jul-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	But IVPs are a higher tier building, so it's better to have a COGC match


[30-Jul-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**jelutz77**:	@Tuffyless Why would anybody ship H2O to a water planet like Demeter?


[31-Jul-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Data-Redacted**:	MORE WATER


[31-Jul-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it's very much not a water planet. Also ORCs use barely any water, not sure why that would even be a factor versus fertility

**Hernanduer**:	using valuable farming real estate to pump water seems wasteful, my Demeter base is 2 ORC and 5 FRM and that doesn't even break 100 H2O/d

**athousandcups**:	what does the governer even do other than collect taxes 🤔


[08-Aug-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The governor is responsible for infrastructure and upkeep


[08-Aug-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	oh - what does "safety" do, for example?


[08-Aug-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	increase workforce satisfaction?


[08-Aug-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's a measure of how safe your workers feel and affects their happiness. If the don't feel safe then they're likely to immigrate away


[08-Aug-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	complex


[08-Aug-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	but clicking through it seems the infrastructure is contributed to by other corporations?


[08-Aug-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Anyone can donate, but people usually consider the governor to be the one "responsible" for making it happen


[08-Aug-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	OOG will often step in on worlds important to us if they aren't getting filled


[08-Aug-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	much of what you see on Harmonia is the previous OOG governor topping things off before his last term ended


[08-Aug-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	But the incumbent has been adding things as well


[08-Aug-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	with the tax money I surmise?


[08-Aug-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	OOG takes care of its worlds


[08-Aug-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	Well if they take good care of things, they get more tax.


[08-Aug-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	So the incentives are sound.


[08-Aug-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We don't usually get as much tax money as we pay in upkeep


[08-Aug-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Presumably. Tax money rarely covers the full cost of a planet, but OOG has many streams of income that far exceed our dividends


[08-Aug-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	is oog the biggest/only faction in antares rn?


[08-Aug-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	I was sold on oog with the name only tbh.


[08-Aug-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	A thrifty governor risks starving our operations of the workers it needs, threatening to imbalance lucrative and complex supply chains worth far more than months of taxes


[08-Aug-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it's a good name


[08-Aug-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	And it can take many weeks to correct lost workers and low happiness if someone goes totally AWOL, for example


[08-Aug-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you're new, I definitely recommend getting into the offical PRUN and the UFO discords


[08-Aug-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it's generally important the governor be a large company capable of affording the costs of running a planet, because yeah, taxes rarely if ever cover the cost


[08-Aug-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	I'm on the prun - what's the ufo ?


[08-Aug-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	Meh I hate Discord. But I guess I’ll go there. Thanks for the pointer.


[08-Aug-23 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	To join OOG we definitely require discord for proper coordination- and also pro (or at least basic) so you can do contracts within the corp


[08-Aug-23 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I assume that applies to most other serious corps as well


[08-Aug-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	although there are freebies like that Etherwind based one


[08-Aug-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Its good to see OOG continues its streak of bullying Govs and planets that are being managed just fine while neglecting the planets they already managed.


[08-Aug-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Maybe its just me, but if my planet had lost 1000 scientists and 3k engineers, like Phobos has, in the past 2 months with weeks at a time without any inputs, I might focus inward rather than try and take on more responsibility


[08-Aug-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That being said, don't misinterpret my comments has condemnation of the people in OOG. OOG is filled with good folks, but we all get busy some time with RL and what not. It just seems to me that there are plenty of planets that need govs, and needlessly fighting existing govs does not aid anyone


[08-Aug-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If anything, it sours the community as a whole


[08-Aug-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Phobos has full upkeep and then some, plus a top tier education program, so there will be plenty more engineers and scientists tonight


[08-Aug-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Good to hear! I hope you are well Churv!


[08-Aug-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The temporary shortage of high tier workers appears to be due to a sudden increase in demand more than anything else, probably because the buff of high tier ships has moved many to expand their high tier electronics production lines


[08-Aug-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	As the incumbent governor, I will point to the fact that population has increased and the rate of spare workers has risen from 0.5% to 5.4%.  So I don't understand why the topic of planets with devolving populations has come up


[08-Aug-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	With regards to upkeep, I've been tending to that very well.  OOG contributions to COGC have just beaten me to the punch and I now have a backlog of materials ready for the next cycle.  I can guarantee I can and will keep things going here


[08-Aug-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	For the future, I have plans to streamline POPI some more and bring us in line with best standard practices to utilize your production fees as best as possible


[08-Aug-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	If you'd like more details on my plans or the planet's finances I can write it up and share a link


[08-Aug-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	I'd definitely appreciate your vote in keeping me on as governor!


[08-Aug-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Worker happiness depends on the upkeep if the last 4 weeks so the current population levels have as much to do with the previous administration as the current


[08-Aug-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	And given my contribution record, you can see it will keep going strong


[08-Aug-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So your solution is sabotage this new Governor who stepped up to fill the gap after Erix left?


[08-Aug-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Only the governor can sabotage himself. Anything donated by anyone not recieving tax money should be considered a bonus. The governor had the ultimate responsibility.


[08-Aug-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Governors cannot control other people's contributions. Implying that he is at fault or less capable due to other people's donations is silly. New governors who have shown no legitimate failing should be given a chance. It is how we as a region grow and lift each other up. If OOG has new folks they want to introduce to governance, I encourage you to take on one of many other planets that could use it


[08-Aug-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	@Churaviis can you be specific in what you think I am doing wrong? I've gone over the setups of a bunch of planets and I believe I'm doing well


[08-Aug-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	I didn't say you were doing anything wrong, @caskman, just that OOG not donating when we don't get tax money shouldn't be considered "sabotage" as mr filthy said


[08-Aug-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To be clear, my statement was that OOG using its size to vote out a governor who is, to all appearances, doing a good job, is sabotage.


[08-Aug-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	In the livestream yesterday the devs mentioned that they would be dropping the single governorship at a time rule so that should fix the problem with lack of governors


[08-Aug-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	So whats the rush to take it from Cask?


[08-Aug-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Frankly, a healthy democracy needs competition so that no one gets complacent


[08-Aug-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Rolling over new players trying to step up and contribute to our region by managing essential planets is self-sabotage.


[08-Aug-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As I said before, it only hurts us and sours people's attitudes.


[08-Aug-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	With some breathing techniques, you can control how you feel regardless of external circumstances. My point is that you can interpret the situating however you want but voters will decide who they think will be the best governor

It's a major planet in ANT space and would do better with having multiple players contributing to infrastructure and upkeep, especially in the long run.

**ReganRotineque**:	In order to not be Unrated (U), your account must be Basic or PRO.  In order to not be Pending (P):      Your company must be a few weeks old     You must fulfill some Local Market/Shipment ads

[08-Aug-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Aug-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Aug-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	you go to population infrastructure then select one of the buildings where "Upkeep" is not full, click on details and then you can contribut.

**Senlis**:	I wanted to ask the local community of my planet on this: as a beginner player, should I focus on expanding production on an item I found very profitable, or diversivy production within my specialty (agriculture)?


[11-Aug-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	depends on what that profitable material is. if it is something that just has a high and likely will drop in price again, i would go with your speciality. If it is something that has a rather stabel price or even is on a low and is still very profitable, expand that to reap the money.


[11-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	you should take a look at the cx charts of antares and also of the other cxs at wich stage that product is


[11-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	but generally: go with the speciallity of the planet, it is very seldom that profits outcompete the 25% production advantage of a planets cogc.

[11-Aug-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	@A.Nell.in.through.there I'm just a newb so maybe not correct, but when I chose my profession as viticulture & faction as antares, I was given three planet options, and of the three this had the best soil fertility


[16-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Senlis**:	That is correct, I don't have a warehouse because my company is small and I have a ship parked at the exchange most of the time.  I have two ships: Knight and Rocinante.  When I buy at the exchange, Knight is selected by default.  However, the product always goes to Rocinante.


[17-Aug-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	Sounds like if you want to avoid the expense of having a warehouse, then if you have two ships at the location at the same time, then you'll need to double check what's where before you send either of them off.


[17-Aug-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	Though, I'd advise just getting a warehouse.  Those things are super cheap.


[18-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The storage selected on the buy/sell buffer had nothing to do with where the packages you buy get deposited, only where the products you sell come from

**Roh**:	For the most part, Faction and APEX reputations only provide a public-facing "medal of recognition". They serve no real ends, for now at the very least, since the game is still in development.


[19-Aug-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That being said, the the Leaderboard does provide at least more penetrating information that what would have to be otherwise tediously sourced manually from the information that the game provides.


[19-Aug-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That being coupled with the info that third-party tools like Aeryen, is able to provide a more comprehensive report of what is going on with people's operations, it alone isn't going to give you a competitive edge aside from giving you ideas to run the numbers and then actually do.

**Senlis**:	Though I am very far from making my second base, I was curious what the expansion option is for an agriculture starter.  Would I want to start a second base to fulfil an expensive part of my current chain, such as DDT, or should I expand into a new industry that could use the RAT, FIM and other consumables I make?


[19-Aug-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	definitely not DDT


[19-Aug-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you would want an FP base, Norwick


[19-Aug-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Senlis**:	@Hernanduer, are you saying FP as in Food Processor?


[20-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	He is - when you look up the Food Processor building, the acronym is FP (just like the acronym for Farm is FRM). People pretty much only talk in acronyms in this game.


[20-Aug-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Senlis**:	I was just making sure because I already have FP here.  It sounds like he is recommending to have all RIG and FRM here and move my FP to another base.


[20-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cherrybark**:	Harmonia has a Resource Extraction focus.  Nearby KW-602C is Food Industries.   Two bases, nothing but RIGs on ETH and FPs on 602c, take advantage of the respective COGC bonuses and Experts will quickly arrive.


[20-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Etherwind is a bit of a ways away. And water is cheap now. yes, move the FPs to norwick and make more farms here


[20-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Or go to Heph and make something completely different


[20-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cherrybark**:	Good grief!  I meant Etherwind, not Harmonia,  for the RIGs with ETH & KW-602c working together.


[20-Aug-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The reason people are saying to move the FPs is because they suggest taking advantage of the Chamber of Global Commerce bonus (COGC).


[20-Aug-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Harmonia has a Agriculture bonus, which means FRMs and HYFs produce 25% faster than elsewhere.


[20-Aug-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Norwick has a Food Production bonus, so FPs and FERs produce 25% faster there.


[20-Aug-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Etherwind has a Resource Production bonus, so RIGs produce H2O 25% faster there.

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	etc.


[20-Aug-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Horst_Tappert**:	well that’s part of the game no?


[23-Aug-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	it's quite interesting isn't it? to make such a buy request they'd need almost 11mil... and if they manage to flip every one of the 70k RAT that they buy, at a profit of 1 per RAT, then that's 70k earned... which is only .6%


[23-Aug-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	so it's kind of like a low interest account? haha


[23-Aug-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	but looking at CXPC RAT.AI1, if I tally up the volumes, I get almost 130mil in the past 7 days? which, if volume is in $ and not units, is still like 800-900k units of volume in the past week


[23-Aug-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	which seems huge? maybe I'm reading the chart wrong, or maybe I'm still too new to the game to comprehend the volumes that happen later....


[23-Aug-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	but if it was true then that's >100k units moved a day (on average), meaning they should be able to move their 70k units in a day....


[23-Aug-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**athousandcups**:	so .6% interest in one day


[23-Aug-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KZ_Kawasaki**:	I think the data is misleading... if money supply is what is held by players, people should smartly put that cash to work as material held at CX. That would reduce money supply but potentially push up prices.


[24-Aug-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	I think the variation of money supply is just a function of the amount of new players


[24-Aug-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	And I bet it’s a number that decreases over time.


[24-Aug-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**tylorh**:	Food for thought, I know when I made my first go at this game a year ago, one person in the general chat was pretty vocal about how producing things was a fool's game, the real way to play was to just play the stock market.


[24-Aug-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Well, first, this is a sandbox game, so it would entirely depend what you'd want to do in the game. Maybe you just want to be foremost a reliable farmer than seek profit (though ofc with more profit you can be even more reliable farmer ^_^')


[24-Aug-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Second, even if profit is only in your mind, saying producing stuff is fool's journey is a bit overstatement imo. It's totally safe and solid way to grow in this game. But can you can make more money in stock market? Maybe, but there's defo risk involved, and there are companies that will take a stance against you if go too far with price manipulation.


[24-Aug-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	But all in all, if gaining profit on purely just trading is your passion and you feel you want to take that journey, by all means, take a chance and go for it ^_^


[24-Aug-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I personally enjoy producing stuff and through that help other companies to reach their own goals. And by that, all the growth I have gained during my playtime is a testament to me for being a valuable part in the game


[24-Aug-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There is no stock market in this game. It's all about "tangible" digital assets -- ie a commodities market. There is also a significant difference therein, being that most RL developments within most developed RL markets take a trend towards oligopolistic market domination, due to the sheer incentives that such a market arrangement provides to those who can dominate over all ther competition -- there is no such capability in here for a single group of players to thoroughly dominate a particular commodity market, aside from the liminations of a given workforce pool in an area.


[24-Aug-23 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What you're left with is an open market, in which anyone can engage in pretty much any commidty market that they wish, at pretty much any time, with little detrimental effect, resulting in  what most would call an open, efficient market. Equity shareholding is largely non-existent, along with other modes of financial investment, as the game is simply not developed to the extent of analogs of what RL can provide as inspiration.


[24-Aug-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The best resource that you can potentially hope to gain at this point is sheer information and experience, which will afford you enough  playstyle efficiency and gains to get you easily past the early and md-games. However there's nothing that will boost you above anyone else who's been playing this game long enough to be sufficiently in the late-game, as the sheer capital sinks, therein, are seemingly logarithmic.

**KZ_Kawasaki**:	Technically stock markets are buying shares in a company.  This is modeled more on commodity exchanges on Earth, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, complete with forward contracts, hedging, but not quite with options.

[29-Aug-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Use the slow MAI recipe to maximize farm production. Long term, move your incinerators to Nascent so you can build more farms. Fertile ground is scarce.


[29-Aug-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alter_Satan**:	Alright so thats the most efficient recipe! Im only able to see one MAI recipe in the farms though? Is that the one?


[29-Aug-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	well, efficiency is a funny word here, because it depends if you want time efficiency, land efficiency, input cost efficiency, etc.etc.


[29-Aug-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but yes, there's only the one MAI receipe for a FRM


[29-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	HYF have more options but require large amounts of H2O


[29-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alter_Satan**:	Alright thanks, I was meaning input cost efficiency


[29-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	yeah, a common midgame shift is from input efficiencies to space efficiencies, depending on how you want to play


[29-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	for example, it takes two FRM bases to feed an FP base, while a single HYF base can feed 2 or even 3 FP bases


[29-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but HYF are much more expensive to run, so the margins are tighter on final products


[29-Aug-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but you make 7k RATs with 3 permits instead of 2k

**Roh**:	You'd think that, however there's significant discrepencies between locations that offer significant benefits (COGC + pertinent resource density + fertility) between industries.....


[30-Aug-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those discrepancies usually will incentivize the setting up of another base, specializing in a different segment of a production tree that you'd like to get into, however it comes with strings attached - being shipping capacity.


[30-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Take Harmonia and Norwick, as an example. If you're only based on Harmonia, and have a vertically integrated farming operation, you'd only have to dedicate shipping for a portion of the time as export. If you decide to separate industries and erect a base on Norwick, you'd have to dedicate shipping about 1/2 of every week to keep Norwick supplied with agricultural goods, and Harmonia supplied with consumables.


[30-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For those of us who did partake in those industrial shifts, we took the time and money to ensure shipping to those bases, one way or another. If you're just starting out, use the time to figure out what && how you're going to be doing things in the future.

**caskman**:	if fertile planets are rare, it would probably make sense to do HYFs on planets with no fertility but that have good gravity, temp, pressure, rocky, and setup an agri cogc there.  Especially next to water worlds like ice station alpha.  Is that viable?


[30-Aug-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	all the good ones are taken


[30-Aug-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well, sort of.


[30-Aug-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most MCG-only worlds that have some sort of mineral density on them, or are in an area that needs another specialized COGC, are, or will be taken.


[30-Aug-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For Ice-station, SE-110B && SE-110E, a rock and a gas planet in it's system, could be used to segment Agriculture from Food Processing. All you'd need is a handful of GEN ships in system to keep the things running indefinitely....


[30-Aug-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	With a shipyard being built at Ice Station, the possibility will be opening up to those interested sometime nearer to the close of this year.


[30-Aug-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh my, it's not being built. I guess there's some confusion on my end regarding the syntax used for a planetary project's status


[30-Aug-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	I was thinking this could be viable in the future when all good fertility worlds are settled but with ghost plots it might be a while before this becomes viable


[30-Aug-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	When RAT prices start to edge closer to the MM, it might be worthwhile looking at those options.


[30-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most RATs produced isn't syphoned off the markets quickly enough. Yes there was some serious market operations a few weeks ago, but the prices are going straight down, again.


[30-Aug-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You have two large production buffers that aren't really noticed. 1) DW worlds like Etherwind, Boucher, Promitor, Verdant, Kinza, can easily be configured into HYF bases should RAT prices rise above a certain consistent margin. 2) Non-Agri COGC, water poor worlds like Phobos, Deimos, Electronica can easily be converted into FRM bases once profit margins of their relevant industries drops beyond a certain consistent margin due to rising consumable costs.

**RemboM**:	after running some numbers, a production force of 200 pioneers would seem to cost about 1.5-2k in upkeep per day. am I 'supposed' to try to get those costs down by making some of my own basics, or is that just the cost of doing business?


[01-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Whatever you make with your pioneers will almost certainly make several times that upkeep cost. So you can either sell other products, or make RAT/DW to mitigate those upkeep costs. It's sort of a "penny saved is a penny earned" situation, so you'll just have to do the math on which works better for you


[01-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you do make those basic workforce upkeep items, you will produce more than you consume, and be able to sell the extras


[01-Sep-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RemboM**:	so I should not worry about bankrupting myself while figuring things out too much? ;)


[01-Sep-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RemboM**:	True words indeed, but as I said, lottery ticket ;) I don't buy scratch, or lottery tickets, and 100 bucks will neither ruin nor make me


[07-Sep-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RemboM**:	plus. it's not because I don't value it as anything but something to sell, doesn't make anyone elses valuation less valid, value is subjective after all


[07-Sep-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RemboM**:	there's many things that from any rational point of view look like the blatant malinvestment that they likely are, that people are making bank off of. Making a couple of bucks off of btc is at least not actively immoral

**krisjanis.liepins**:	Good morning, everyone!


[11-Sep-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	I have got a problem. I'm buying OVE for my workers at ANT. When writing a price in the offer, to buy instantly I aimed for the lowest price listed, which is 97.60. My keyboard is set up to use a comma as decimal instead of a dot, APEX didn't recognise it and instead listed my offer with 97 AIC.


[11-Sep-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	I didn't notice it at first and was wondering why the goods are not added in my ship's cargo, and where may I find pick-up contract. But that's not relevant. The point is, I have a BUY offer with a price a little lower than lowest SELL offer's price, and no money to add new offer. Question is, can I edit or remove my offer?


[11-Sep-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	Also, I'll have a lot of free space when I head back to Harmonia, if someone needs some shipping.


[11-Sep-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	OK, I found a way to delete my CX offer. Using CXOS command will open the list of all your own CX offers, and there are two options: VIEW and DELETE.


[11-Sep-23 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	I still have 499.55t/499.55m^3 cargo space from Antares to Harmonia, departing when full.


[11-Sep-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Glad you figured it out. Thankfully, you didn't make the opposite mistake and Buy a whole lotta goods when you intended to Sell.


[11-Sep-23 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	Then I would simply have twice as many goods to sell


[11-Sep-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**HamletsFather**:	With a payed account you have acces to a currency exchange. Otherwise many just sell / buy goods on the CXs to get other currencies. Or they trade with another player (but that also requires that at least one of them has pro).

**Churaviis**:	Unfortunately you would need PRO to be able to do LM ads or direct contracts with other players. You can start over with COLIQ, which most do in the beginning, or appeal to a higher authority (Molp)

**jelutz77**:	B-fab prices are a result of inflation. B-fab MM's will eat up a lot of the currency so that we'll see prices drop a bit hopefully.

**Figglehort**:	I'm pretty sure planetary surveys aren't very worth it. If I were you I'd just mainly do the shipping(if you're already going there, of course) and resource contracts. Of course, if you're already going to that planet you might as well survey it.

**caskman**:	Big thanks to all of you who donate upkeep.  I see some people donating to SDC and EMC which I appreciate but I haven't been supplying those since it's cheaper to upkeep SST and INF and upgrade those buildings.  I'll de-activate the SDC and EMC buildings when their upkeep runs out to help indicate in the future which buildings we care about


[16-Oct-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	For those of you that want to help out, the COGC and SST are the best buildings to donate to.  You can donate to INF if you want but I'm also trying to keep that to OFF since the INF building doesn't impact pop growth as much as SST.

**Horst_Tappert**:	Damn I started a NUT production batch


[17-Oct-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	this shit litteraly takes mor than a month


[17-Oct-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	and now I have 2% completed so I am in this weird place "I have buyers remorse but I am going to keep it anyway"


[17-Oct-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	Life is tough.

**Churaviis**:	It shouldn't take that long, Click on the "NEW ORDER" button and look in the Efficiency Factors line to see what's slowing it down so much


[17-Oct-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	It takes mine 25 days with my experts off for the maximum order of NUT, up from 19 and a half with them off. The other few days could be a result of not using luxury consumables.


[17-Oct-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	19 and a half with them on, rather.

**jelutz77**:	@Horst_Tappert Or did you start a batch of 20? There's no efficiency bonus for a large batch. No batch of 1 takes a month to produce unless you're missing consumables or labor like crazy, not even with a building at minimum condition.


[20-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If you want to re-start the batch, it'll give you pro-rated production for the batches so far when you cancel.


[20-Oct-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	oh thanks for the answer


[20-Oct-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	its 240 units of NUT


[20-Oct-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	Right now it’s 9% done and 1month 4 days left


[20-Oct-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	satisfaction is not 100% but nothing horrible


[20-Oct-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	I didnt know about the production bonus when you cancel. Thanks a lot


[20-Oct-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Horst_Tappert**:	I guesse a 240 batch is a bit crazy :D

**sztypettto**:	Hi everyone! New to the game here. Just discovered this channel. Looking forward to contributing to the community.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Are the 6 professions the only professions in the game or are there more?


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The profession only determines your starting material, you can branch out into whatever other industry later on in the game so don't worry too much about which one you choose.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Ah! Thank you


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Is there a moderating community on this planet or is it more like wild west/Eve online?


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I'm wondering because it would be beneficial not to saturate producers for a specific profession where the supply significantly exceeds the demand.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The invisible hand is good enough at pushing people into the professions they need to be in through price signals, in the long term at least


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Naturally, however the market is not visible at the start of the game when picking professions at the start of the game to determine market opportunity


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	So I'm wondering whether the market i.e Commodity Exchanges are visible outside the game and updated in real time there too


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	There's a variety of products you can make within any of the starting professions and all of them have high velocity, so any of them are going to be fine to start with. At worst you can always open up a new buffer and enter COLIQ to start over


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I did not know that. Thanks man for the helpful tip. In my case I did find opportunity at the CX.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Do you have prior experience playing Eve online or a similar space economy sim by any chance? Or is this the only game in the genre you play?


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	A lot of this games players have played Eve online so the comparison definitely has merit


[29-Oct-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Sounds exciting. Thanks for the helpful tips and chat. Looking forward to contributing here. <o


[29-Oct-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	This is a planetary chat, so it's best for when you need something only local neighbors can provide. For future help, there's a discord channel that's a bit more active: https://discord.gg/gR2XMp7J

**Saganaki**:	Pretty far.  6 total planets.


[10-Nov-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Definitely is.  Keep at it and after a couple days it just clicks.  And then after that, you'll do the Factorio thing except with spreadsheets.

**sztypettto**:	If you've just started playing Factorio there's a whole new world with giant mods like K2, SE, Pynadon etc. The upcoming expansion of Factorio will only add several years more of playability to it. After the mods update themselves, Factorio will easily last until 2030.

[11-Nov-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Expansion is SE 2.0. SE was made by the original developers, so....


[11-Nov-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I'd love to combine the new expansion with updated versions of K2 and mods that expand the tech trees, recipes, and add a variety of new mechanics, such as different enemy types instead of just biters.


[11-Nov-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**sztypettto**:	Does anyone else find it strange that one single company is creating artificial demand and supply at the Antares Commodities Exchange by flipping several commodities?


[17-Nov-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	May I ask what commodities are you talking about?


[17-Nov-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ragadais**:	It's not artificial. To make a buy order you have to deposit the money. To make a sell order you have to deposit the goods. It's actually a standard practice in real life, too (except in real life you can d oit without having the money/goods up front).


[17-Nov-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	Another question from my side: what is "flipping"?


[17-Nov-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Flipping: Buy hi, sell low


[17-Nov-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Make money


[17-Nov-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	@sztypettto it's not strange per se, inasmuch as it happens quite regularly by players who have loads of cash


[17-Nov-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	But who aren't logging on so much anymoer


[17-Nov-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Numsgil**:	oh is that what I've been doing wrong


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	playing market maker is actually a nice way to make money, if there's a good spread and enough volume.  You buy goods from players at the bid price who need money right away and sell them at a slight markup at the ask later on.  The downside is if the price moves you can end up with a lot of a commodity you don't want


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The secret is to play market maker hardest on the things you can actually use so that if you do end up with too much then you can at least use it eventually no matter how long the price is low


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Playing MM also ties up A LOT of funds you would be better off using to expand your Empire. It's only really viable for those who have maxed out their bases and have a lot of disposable cash.


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it depends on what ROI you can get for your base vs. trading.  The less money you have the easier it is to get some nice returns because you don't have to worry about moving the market too much


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	most profitable recipes that I've looked at (all the agri and food ones) have a breakeven point (the point at which you've doubled your money, basically) of maybe 10 days (there are some exceptions that are more like 7, and the best is 4).  10 days to double is pretty doable trading, if that's your jam

[26-Nov-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Hi, welcome!


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	Yeah, I tried playing this game before but made several mistakes so now I'm back to actually do stuff this time


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	what starter profession did you choose?


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	food farmer


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	idk how to spell it


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Victualler, right?


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	yep


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	that's a good one to start with


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	I figured "hey i won't have to buy food for my workers"


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yeah being able to make drinking water and rations yourself is nice


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	ye


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	drinking water (DW) is also fetching a high price right now, so it's good to make a surplus and sell it at the exchange


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	good to know


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	how long does to usually take for high/low prices to come and go?


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I've been playing for 2 weeks and the prices have been pretty stable across the board in that timeframe


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	wow


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	You can also see a price chart.  Type eg: "CXPC DW.AI1" without the quotes in a new window and you can see the fluctuations of drinking water's price


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	ah crap it added extra nonsense


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	"CXPC DW(dot)AI1" but (dot) is a .


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	gotcha


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it'll say "No data", but if you change the top left to "180d" and the top right to "3d", for instance, it should work

[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	most governors get to govern as long as they do a good job.  it's pretty common for governors to be on like their 20th term


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	huh


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	good job meaning that there's enough workers to go around


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	well so far I've had no issues with lack of workers


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	new here... wow.. a lot of info to process for a tutorial


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	yeah


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	what starter job did you go with?


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	carbon farmer


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	shouldn't be too hard


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	i think*


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	im sure ill level out once i get the hang of it. its basically a world builder with extra steps, yeah?


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	a LOT of extra steps...


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	Many many menus


[26-Nov-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	noted :)


[26-Nov-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Bad time to be a carbon farmer


[26-Nov-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Carbon market is saturated with excessive suppliers


[26-Nov-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	And if you're scared of extra steps, business engineering isn't for you


[26-Nov-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Should be thankful this isn't eve online


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	still very green to this. trying to get the hang of things in as short a time as possible


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	The 4 C <- 4 HCP +  2 GRN + 2 MAI recipe is pretty good


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	But honestly even the 4 C <- 4 HCP recipe is profitable enough


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	3 hours in, first time. im sure ill understand what that means soon enough but for now its all foreign.


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	thank you for the input though, i do appreciate it.


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	C is carbon


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	GRN MAI and HCP are things you grow


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you can type "MAT C" in a buffer window and it will show info on it


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	(you can open a new buffer with the NEW BFR button at the bottom left of the screen)


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	thank you. that was covered (sorta) in the tutorial vids, ive got the base built, got the farmstead and incinerator running their first production runs, currently im trying to figure out how to get it sold, but have another 10 hours before it even finishes.


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	once the run finishes it'll dump the finished products into your base's inventory.  Then you either use it as input for another recipe or haul it to market to sell.  The market is two star systems over and takes between 8-24 hours to fly there


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the tutorial covers this; I'm just giving you a quick overview


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	youre definitley more helpful than the global chat guys. its most certainly appreciated.


[26-Nov-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I started 2 weeks ago so it's still fresh on my mind, I think

**Hammond1983**:	so, either i havent seen it yet, or its not covered in the tutorial vids, but i get more materials for construction at the markets?


[26-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yeah, almost everything can be bought and sold at the markets (except for ships and base permits, but those can be built using things from the market)


[26-Nov-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	alright, and thanks


[26-Nov-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	to give you some rough idea, the cadence of play for me is every morning I load up finished products on a ship and send it to market. I sell stuff at the market at the bid price, take the money I made and buy raw products to make more stuff with, then ship it back to unload in the evening


[26-Nov-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	probably the same outline ill eventually follow.


[26-Nov-23 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you might not need to go every day, it depends on what you're making.  Fuel isn't free, either, so it's good to be deliberate with where you send your ships


[26-Nov-23 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	exactly how far will one full tank take me?


[26-Nov-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it depends how much slow you're willing for your ships to go.  I can get from here to market with like 50 of each fuel if I'm willing for the trip to take a day.  If I'm impatient it can take 100s of SF


[26-Nov-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you start with 500 FF and 1500 SF in each ship, which can last a long time if you weant it to


[26-Nov-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	so if i need to i can haul ass to a further market if necessary and not have to worry too much about not getting back...


[26-Nov-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	still trying to think all this out.


[26-Nov-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yeah fuel cost is less about distance and more about time, if that makes sense


[26-Nov-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
***user56548b51a3** left.*


[26-Nov-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	if you're okay going real slow you can get from here to halfway across the galaxy without a ton of fuel


[26-Nov-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	here to MOR (another market) takes 60 SF and 210 FF if you're willing for it to take 3 days


[26-Nov-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you'd need to buy FF for the return trip, though


[26-Nov-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hammond1983**:	all good, and thanks. definitely wont be leaving with anything less than a full hold anyway


[26-Nov-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it's probably worth making a trip once you have enough stuff to sell that you can buy the materials for another producing building.  Especially in the beginning, 1 extra farm can increase your income by like 50%

**sans-**:	i just posted 2 in-system shipping ads on the local market. both fit into one startet ship and jointly are worth 5000 AIC. i hope, for some newer player this might be a little startup cash boost... ;)


[27-Nov-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you can also just sell the extra fuel for a bit of extra money


[27-Nov-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and I'd go for selling at your own ask, rather than selling to bids. Something like C there isn't a big difference, but in a lot of places it can take the entire profit


[27-Nov-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	if you can stomach the extra wait


[27-Nov-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	also there's a help channel, it's typically much more useful than the global chat


[27-Nov-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	ah, another tip, on fuel usage. FTL fuel scales a lot more linearly than STL fuel, moving the STL slider you might get a few hours, but often maxing the FF usage isn't a big deal and can get you a lot more time

[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	unfortunately only PRO and BASIC accounts can send or receive money directly, and since Harmonia is a starter world I'd wager most of the electorate are on trial accounts


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	too effin bad


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I'd also be curious what objectives you'd want the governor to set.  They don't have control over that many things


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Good question.


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	They can set the production fees, I'm not sure what else.  Anyone can contribute to the planetary infrastructure projects


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	well if it being a governor is all about setting product fee, then who gives a F.


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	they're ostensibly in charge of the upkeep of all the POPI buildings, paid for by the production fees


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	but again there anyone can contribute if they want


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Perhaps the governor should do some analysis and tell us what to contribute, invest, or build businesses for?


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the fun of the game is sort of figuring that stuff out yourself, no?


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	then what's the point of the gov except pulling the production fee levers?


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	there isn't really one, that's kind of my point.  Bragging rights maybe?


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I mean, I could be wrong, but I think governorship is a thankless unprofitable job that people do because of the Space Fantasy


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it's a bit half baked as far as game design goes


[28-Nov-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	A role without reward and accountability, pretty much defeats the point of the role. Then just about anyone can be governor. Whoever is the least tired, and has the most time gets to be gov

[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**krisjanis.liepins**:	As we have two candidates, wouldn't it be benefitial to hear from each of them why we would need to vote for them?


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's always good to have competitive


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	How about we wager bets?


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Instead of us voting, make both candidates bid for their seat


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Whoever bids the highest, has the highest stake on the line.


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	We measure their performance with their objectives


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	what if the candidates decide they want to raise the production fee to make up for the deficit?


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	If they fail in some objectives, their wager gets deducted equal to the value of that objective, and gets distributed among the voters. If the candidate succeeds in all objectives, they get their money back, plus a reward from the voters.


[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	generally speaking, governors are also in charge of population management through POPI


[28-Nov-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The most important aspect of being a governor is taking on the responsibility of ensuring the COGC and Planetary Infrastructure are fed adequately to make sure we all have the POPs we all need.


[28-Nov-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	There is no way to make a profit as a governor; it's very much an enabler role, a charity.


[28-Nov-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I find it personally rewarding, though you'll probably only ever hear from others when the wheels are falling off the bus )or during elections like is happening now).


[28-Nov-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	As for "accountability", there have been many, many movements to change governors who, for whatever reason, were not handling the planet correctly.

**ReganRotineque**:	i think caskman has done an admirable job - planet is stable and growing - no wild population swings - consistent taxation


[28-Nov-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	the upkeep and other bits must take quite a bit of time to get together - so I am very appreciative of those who take on these types of roles


[28-Nov-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	Weekly I make roughly 220k AIC from taxes but then pay about 447k AIC in upkeep.  I could profit if I more than doubled taxes again, but I make 350k AIC daily in production so it's not a problem


[28-Nov-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Also, if you don't have a governor, no one can run the planetary projects, which can be very cheap ways to tweak the population


[28-Nov-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	But yep, we have more than a few new bases worth of people looking for jobs on Harmonia, so the governor is doing a good job


[28-Nov-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yeah, no complaints, especially considering the vast inrush of new players

**SteelPhoenix**:	Would it be worth it to gun for my own water extractor or two?  Or is it too early?


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it isn't too early, but you're likely better off buying water on the market and using the money you were going to use to build a rig to build another farm


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Makes sense


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Water is cheap, farm products are expensive


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	How bad is STL fuel though?


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	I don't know how much a run to the CX would use up


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you can use the BLU command to test the starter ships if you want to see how much fuel/how long it will take to get somewhere


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	that said, you should be able to get to the CX with 100 SF and 50 FF, or more like 50/50 if you don't mind going really slow


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	fuel is cheap too


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	roughly 2k each way, I think


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	$2k credits for the fuel I mean


[29-Nov-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	but there are faction contracts to take packages to the CX that you can use to pay for most of the fuel cost


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Ah, Nice


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Is there a way to get more contracts, or do I just need to wait for them in the mail?


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	just wait, they come about once a day


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Ah


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Thanks for the help


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Unfortunately I set all of my queues as far as they can go, so I can't do much with production for a while


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	I was reading around and heard something about people contracting out shipping though? Is that still common or was that an older occurence?


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	I don't really think my second ship will see much use with just one base, afterall


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	they're posted on the Local Markets


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Harmonia doesn't have a ton, but there are usually some at the CX, but they can take you all over, it's rare to find one that's going where you want to go


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Eh, That isn't an option for me then


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Anything useful that the spare ship can do on FREE?


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	if you can get enough money to bankroll it you could probably ship stuff between the different CXs and make a profit, but that probably needs at least like ~50k in starter capital to make it work


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	annoyingly there are loans you can get from other players, but they also need a PRO or BASIC account


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TallBird**:	Paying the PRO fee once gives you BASIC after it runs out :)


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	otherwise you may want to sell all the fuel for one of your ships, since you aren't likely to need it for a really long time.  You can use the money you get for it to build another farm


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	1500 SF is about the cost of a new farm


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Oh, that's how BASIC works?


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Guess I could consider it then, won't be anytime soon though


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	Alright, Ill probably do the fuel sell thing and get a cash crop in or smthn


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Another option to make money is to play market maker.  Put a buy order to buy eg: water at the top of the bid price, then sell it back at a bit under the current ask price.  I've turned 2k into 20k over the past two weeks doing that


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it's not without risk, though


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SteelPhoenix**:	What's the risk?


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	You can buy a commodity for some price, market will move and you will be forced to sell for less

**Numsgil**:	Hi!


[04-Dec-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	So I started my career as a carbon farmer.  Accidentally grew some beans.  Oh well.


[04-Dec-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	Is a liquid extractor a good investment?


[04-Dec-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	on some planets yes, but probably not on Harmonia.  You're likely better off using the money to make another farm instead, and buy water at the CX


[04-Dec-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saxi**:	I made a rig anyway. Works well enough but maybe not optimal


[04-Dec-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you'll definitely make a profit extracting water, and it's certainly less hassle to make it locally than to import it.  But the ROI isn't great


[04-Dec-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saxi**:	yea not sure extracting water for profit is the way to go. Best to consume it to make something worth more


[04-Dec-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the question is really more about opportunity cost.  The money you spend building that rig, what else could it build instead?


[04-Dec-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If you're starting out and don't have another base, RIG can save you a lot of trouble shipping in water. IMO it's worth it for the shipping avoidance even without an otherwise meager ROI.

***SpiritWolf72** joined.*


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	When you say "not on Harmonia", is that due to the planet having a relatively low amount of water available?


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	If this planet doesn't have good water, I'm curious what it does offer.  Decent fertility?


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	good governor I guess


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	The number of fertile planets is fairly low and farms only operate on fertile planets


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rainbows_bicth**:	90-somthing% is good enough I guess


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Antares space is especially low on fertile planets


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	The only one higher than Harmonia is Demeter


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	Well what am I doing farming in Antares...


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	People have to get their food from somewhere


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	You'll make decent profits farming on Harmonia


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Whether for consumables or carbon


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Once you grow big enough you can move your processing (FP or INC) off Harmonia to make way for more farms.  If you go for consumables, move the FP to Norwick.  If you go carbon, move the INC to Nascent


[04-Dec-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	Why Nascent?  I see it has some pop


[04-Dec-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	I haven't really begun to explore the various systems


[04-Dec-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Every planet has a specialisation from the Chamber of Global Commerce.  That gives you a 25% production boost to the relevant sector.  On Harmonia that is agriculture.  On Nascent it is resource extraction


[04-Dec-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordeo**:	I see.  That information is available by opening the CoGC on that planet?


[04-Dec-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yeah I try to time my round trips to once a day or so.  They're sometimes full bringing water back but not always.  If you had packages roughly 100/100 I could use them to fill out my cargo hold

**Druthlen**:	Can someone help me out. Hydrocarbon plants require 2 water, yet High Calorie Grains only require 1 water for the same amount of HCP. And they produce the same amount of Carbon. Why would anyone grow HCP?


[14-Dec-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Afka**:	There are recipes or Carbon that use HCP, GRN and MAI which allows for faster production.


[14-Dec-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	yeah it makes more sense at production of scale


[14-Dec-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	with FRMs, never makes sense


[14-Dec-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	The 4 C <-    4 HCP +   2 GRN +   2 MAI recipe is currently giving the best ROI.  It's not material efficient but it takes so much less time that you can run a lot more recipes


[14-Dec-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the difference is several 100 AIC/day, so it's not a huge difference


[14-Dec-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**EnragedTribble**:	it depends more what you care about really. the only GRN route is more C per day per farm planet but takes waay more INCs to run it. Doing the triple recipe gives less C per day, but is much more workforce and space efficient on your INCs

**Kaffiend**:	So as new farmer in ANT where should i be looking for good soil?


[20-Dec-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Harmonia is the best of the lot, and the COGC supports farming.  You can also look at Phobos.  Deimos is another one, but it's full, so you won't be able to start a base there.


[20-Dec-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	See https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	You can also move all your food processing buildings off of Harmonia to Norwick, to make more room


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaffiend**:	This is what i was thinking, just trying to get an idea for hauling costs etc


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Or if you're a carbon farmer, move your incinerators to Nascent


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I would wait to expand until you run out of space on Harmonia


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaffiend**:	Just started, so i'm only theory crafting at the moment. Learning


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	The early game is going to be a lot of slowly building more and more farms, unless you get a PRO account and arrange for loans/gifts from other players


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	neither is right/wrong, just depends what you want from the game


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaffiend**:	Plan is to get familiar then make a decision on PRO. Eve Indy pilot so i like it a lot


[20-Dec-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mutex**:	all right. thx


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	but just open it and then scroll through it each step of the contract has a button to complete


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	In business, to close a contract means to accept it. You're not the first to be confused by that terminology, however, as closed has a different meaning in different contexts.


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	it's interesting because when trading stock options, "sell to open" means to create a new option, and "sell to close" means to complete the option and get rid of it.  So even in business it's not always consistent


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	dont get me started on the use of the term volume


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	it also has a variety of uses


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Welcome, @jopgood!


[03-Jan-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	What industry is your company building?


[03-Jan-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	A good recommendation is to not build an industry for a commodity that's already saturated.


[03-Jan-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jopgood**:	Hey @sztypettto! Thanks for the rec! I am starting out as a carbon farmer so I was thinking of focusing on building a stable production line for that. Eventually getting into liquid harvesting -> crop growing -> carbon generation -> distribution


[03-Jan-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jopgood**:	I am also working on setting up some nice APEX screens to track the local CXLs and chart the commodities in my supply chain but i believe currently you can't design properly-linked dashboards? Like have one tile be the commodity chooser and then have all other tiles update based on this selection? Such as trade charts or inventories etc.

**sztypettto**:	Glad to be of help


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I would suggest not to become a carbon farmer


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	If you already have a carbon facility, use it to make carbon as a wrought product for something else


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	There has been an influx of new carbon farmers recently, as well as some old ones.


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	That's driving down prices


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	And all the good private contracts are secured


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	So you'll only end up into a bear market, slow grind, fighting for penny stocks


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Just saving you the headache and boredom from being in that position after a few weeks


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Regarding dashboarding, you're coming from an area where jumping all the hoops is streamlined.


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Can't have it completely like ERP


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Some hoops will exist


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	But one you personalise the screens and buffers to your fitting, it becomes second nature to switch between screens and keep your company running

**Avacyn**:	slowly making my screens into a bloomberg terminal


[03-Jan-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	At the current prices I think carbon farmer is still viable.  Each incinerator makes you 1k a day in profit, and farmsteads making GRN are likewise about 1k/day in profit


[03-Jan-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Assuming you're selling to buy orders on the CX


[03-Jan-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	which is the most pessimistic


[03-Jan-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	buying some DDT and using the farms to make HER would be a little better, but you don't have the vertical integration with the incinerators, so there's more trips to the CX you need to do, and fuel ain't cheap in the early game


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Just buying H2O from the CX and putting up pure FRMs currently makes 2.4k/day per FRM.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	14x FRMs = 14x2.4k = 33k/day.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	that's quite a bit more than my math shows.  What are you having the FRMs make?


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Using that H2O to make BEA will double that at the moment (though the price for BEA has spiked).


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You're right that making HER and selling to the CX will make the most for FRMs, but the DDT is quite an investment when you're starting out.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	yes, no doubt


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	@numsgil either https://universallogistics.app/building/FRM or PRUNplanner


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	prunplanner and the like assume the average price of a commodity, which can be rough for a new player


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	since oyu have to post the sell order and wait for someone to buy it from you


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	like, there haven't been any trades for BEA yet today


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	True. At 380/u, there won't be.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Still, there are other things one can do: Sell on the LM, perhaps then contact that player to try set up long-term Buys. The benefit of that is you won't need to ship to the CX. In fact, a number of buyers will pay you ahead of time for the goods before you even produce them.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	though that's not an option for FREE players


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	That requires PRO or BASIC though; if you're still on FREE you'll have to rely on the CX.


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I agree that farms definitely have better ROI than incinerators, currently.  Not a bad strategy to just focus on farms


[03-Jan-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	I should really make a formula for what % to go from the max, min or avg


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I like using the max if I need to buy raw resources and the min if I'm selling to the market.  It helps show which products are in really strong demand and gives a profit floor


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	if I make more than that by trading, so much the better


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheynas**:	Question: What about pivoting from carbon-farming into OVE production? Just need to build a BMP and import Hydrogen, right?


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Making spreadsheets counts as playing this game...


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Oh I'm making like.... a couple spreadsheets for this game


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	not putting INC on harmonia also lets you save money later by not needing to demolish them to minmax for COGC bonuses


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Unironically making weekly/quarterly reports


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	you could do OVE


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	growing RCO isn't the best use of farms, though


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Yea, maximising for the COGC bonus is really good. +25% production speed is "free" production time, since your workers don't require more consumables to produce that extra.


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	like, if you wanted to do OVE, growing GRN and selling it and buying RCO on the CX would get you more RCO per hour


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I don't know who's flooded the market with RCO but the current price is really cheap


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	barely covers labor


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Companies and corps buying all that Carbon. Da hell are they doing with that? Making metal?


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Probably :3


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	that or maybe selling to other markets


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	that's somewhat scummy to buy from one market to sell to another


[03-Jan-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prinzadmiral_Kaos**:	hello can somebody tell me whats happen when i demolish buildings? whats happend to the material and workers?


[03-Jan-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Why's that? :o its just an opportunity to make AIC elsewhere

[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	The lure of jobs is promoted to bring in new workers. Money is collected from their visa fee and other licenses. Unemployment rate remains high. Happiness remains low. Visa expiry is always around the corner. Companies go bust. Cycle continues.


[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prinzadmiral_Kaos**:	interesting


[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	There's no distinction between male and female workers


[03-Jan-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	damn


[03-Jan-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Exercise, self managed routine, and goals worth living for is the only way out my guy


[03-Jan-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Took me nearly 4 years to get out of it


[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	yeah, I gotta go back to the gym, I started eating healthier tho


[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Keep at it


[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Don't give up. and don't commit suicide


[03-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Don't contract any serious disease either


[03-Jan-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	This year goal is to keep my progress to getting to 200 lbs, I already lost 50 lbs


[03-Jan-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	B)


[03-Jan-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	That's pretty good

[03-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	oh understood, I just have horrible self image issues :3 the dysmorphia and dysphoria doesn't help


[03-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I don't even know what those are


[03-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	But if you need someone to talk to


[03-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	I wouldn't worry about it, but I have people supporting me B)


[03-Jan-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Someone who had gone through depression, mental breakdown, anxiety, frustration, fat body, and a lot more, and then bounced back again after several withdrawals and setbacks, you can talk to me


[03-Jan-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Awesome


[03-Jan-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Bless those people supporting you


[03-Jan-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Oh shall do, yeah I had a massive identity crisis in uni and dropped out, but I moved out on my own which I'm p happy to do


[03-Jan-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	and I got a job in a new state B)


[03-Jan-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Incredible


[03-Jan-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I never finished my undergraduate, but things still worked out okay for me


[03-Jan-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	everyone has this rigid idea of the right path from school to uni to job, but lots of roads lead to a happy life


[03-Jan-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	now that I'm away from my parents I can be who I am, I just need to get a new wardrobe, learn how to actually save money, and keep taking my meds


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	now imma do my best to make money here B)


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	@Numsgil, agreed. At the same time, I would add that being in a happening place gets one to meet and connect with a number of people, that leads to doors and opportunities. Finishing a University itself doesn't do much. But places like Universities, Malls, workplaces, community centres, golf clubs, gyms etc gets you to meet interesting people.


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Universities work great for some people, and are really awful for others.  I just mean to say it's not a one size fits all solution, and the stigma around dropping out or persuing some other path is BS and actively harms people


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I'm a software engineer, and no one has ever cared if I have a degree or not, only if I'm a good engineer


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the degree would have made things easier for my first job, but after that, it just didn't matter


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I spent hundreds (thousands?) of hours programming for fun before my first job, which is where I learned the stuff I needed


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I even worked for Google for like 7 years, so it's not like I didn't have all the oppurtunities that others with degrees had


[03-Jan-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	My path was weird and definitely not for everyone, but it worked for me

**sztypettto**:	If you know anything about Arclight, it's pretty far away, in another currency that's basically shit, and its worthless to anyone buying Aluminium there because that region lacks economic prowess. So the only people who will flock to buy from there will be from Moria and Antares, to scoop it up on the cheap.


[09-Jan-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	But that's the fun part, it kicks in greed to hoard.


[09-Jan-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	larger FF tanks help, when you're short of time for updating stuff. They're more suitable when you have a good income pouring in.


[12-Jan-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	Is there a ball park figure financially, before even looking at an additional ship(s)? Or other infrastructure milestones that need to be hit before even looking into it?


[12-Jan-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	and is there a point where you really suddenly see the need for larger/additional vessels? Do the newbie faction contracts suddenly ask for a little more? Or is that more a thing for after taking  Pro License and player contracts etc?

[12-Jan-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	and, also is there a "meta"? Are a large majority of the playerbase all doing similar things - found a profitable production chain they like, scaled up, and now just basically farm currency? Or is it much more diverse than that? Thanks


[12-Jan-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	A new ship is going to cost you somewhere around 6-8 million if it has FTL capability. At least if you are sourcing parts yourself. I think you need a pro license as well to operate the shipyards. Once you are making a million every couple weeks or so, I would say that it might start becoming feasible to save up. Usually you will want to upgrade your starter ships first though. That can be done for around 3 million.


[12-Jan-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	Your need for shipspace really depends on your setup.


[12-Jan-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	The faction contracts never increase in size that I know of.


[12-Jan-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	Awesome thanks!


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FrooduBigguns**:	As for a meta, there are sure to be things that are more profitable than others, but since it is a game about markets and selling, if you flood a market with a certain resource, the market price will drop. I don't play very competetivly so others could probably give you a better answer to that one.


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the anti-meta is making IDC and selling it to the market makers.  There aren't any resource inputs for it beyond the labor required to run the building, and it has one of the best profit/base area ratios in the game.  But it'd also be pretty boring to actually run, since there's so very little interaction with other players


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	the ROI is also like 40 days (the building is very expensive) so it's a very late-game thing to even attempt


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	Ah ok cool thanks, so there are reasons to collaborate with other players/corps beyond contracts?


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	well, it's fun for one


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	in a way, you collaborate with other players implicitly when you buy and sell on the CX


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	I get the fun part, I was interested if there were mechanics etc that might incentivise it though?


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	there are projects that are difficult or expensive to do for one person


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	but in principle evereything you can do with a group you can do solo

[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	There are many projects going that exploit the COGC & Experts system to maximize output for everyone involved in the Project. They're both profitable and fun, since you're playing this game with others.


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	As for ships: Before you buy a new ship, you should upgrade your starter ships. A WCB upgrade costs between 400k-900k (depending where you source & what parts you upgrade with).


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I ran 10 bases with 2 upgraded starter ships easily (all my bases were around ANT). I only started having real trouble around base 12.


[12-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Lastly: Another reason to play with others (other than the Profit & Social aspect) is the fact that you can secure long-term contracts at reliable volumes & prices. Knowing the price of an input, even if it's momentarily higher than the CX, and reliable supply are worth more than the opposite.


[12-Jan-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**polygonworkshops**:	Excellent! Thanks guys! I have no desire to get another ship, just wanted a little context to general gameplay etc, great to hear! and thanks to everyone who chipped in :)

[13-Jan-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jan-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jan-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	well you can do half-ish of both EXT and INC. i only have 7 EXT and they supply a full expert 20 SME AL base

**Avacyn**:	Oooo, noted


[13-Jan-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	I think I would want the seperation for a couple reasons personally


[13-Jan-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Avacyn**:	Actually the INC make sense there whoops, but eventually I would love more of a seperation, but I'm unsure where


[13-Jan-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	beware the shipping requirements of nascent ALO though. even just 7 EXT is 441t/327m^3 of exports per day. using more of your area for C prod which is easier to export in a WCB can make a big difference. i'd be overflowing with ALO i couldn't ship if i went all EXT


[13-Jan-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	hell even now i outsource my nascent ALO exports to the LM lol


[13-Jan-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	also having agri to import can make your trips a bit more productive than flying to nascent with an empty cargo hold


[13-Jan-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	not sure there is a better spot for INC. i don't see a closer resource extraction COGC

[22-Jan-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You really only need to be worried when you've got open jobs, and that's pretty unlikely to happen on a low-tier workforce starter planet

**Archiel**:	Soemone who was asking what a governor does, there's a guide you can check out here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDvP3Iz-MDIa_uoQPsJDDOHn72dK7T02k1oAa94K2W0/edit

**sztypettto**:	I like to stir s*** up and see how people react.


[22-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	The people who get triggered are passionate and convinced about something


[22-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	The people who don't get triggered are conceited and calculated


[22-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	The people who don't respond don't even know wtf is going on around them


[22-Jan-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	MysteriousWalrus revealed an important fact about real life inadvertedly


[22-Jan-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Happiness is a lever to control unemployment in real life too.


[22-Jan-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	The more people that are unemployed, the greater the supply for labour, the higher the competition for price i.e. salary, similar to the CX that we see in PU


[22-Jan-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Get too much happiness, and the country or neighbourhood suffers from unwanted immigration (local or international)


[22-Jan-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	That gives a lot of weight to the answer by @MysteriousWalrus +1


[22-Jan-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Glad I made a thought-provoking comment ;P

[31-Jan-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	for the moment at least


[31-Jan-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh you sparked some action lol


[31-Jan-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	the starting contracts need you to purchase locally to fulfill is all


[31-Jan-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	that can't be true


[31-Jan-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gutzee**:	i may be misreading this one


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	wild depth this game has, very neat


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	influence.io is this but on chain


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	check the Party column of that section. if it's blank it's something you have to do, if it has a name it's something the other party has to do


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	party column is empty


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	that one probably has the NPC name listed, meaning they will give you 500 SF to pick up upon completion of prerequisite conditions


[31-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	ah okay


[31-Jan-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh it's empty?


[31-Jan-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	party is empty, but no the market is not empty haha


[31-Jan-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	someone seeded it


[31-Jan-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	now*


[31-Jan-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	well if the party column is blank for that condition that means you need to do it. in this case providing 500 SF to Harmonia.


[31-Jan-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	which doesn't involve the LM(local market)


[31-Jan-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you need to fly a ship to the CX(commodity exchange) and buy some, then bring it back


[31-Jan-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	i completely read that wrong


[31-Jan-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gutzee**:	thx

**shagie**:	You're either a victualizer or a carbon farmer... I hope.


[05-Feb-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	From a game perspective, this is based on the bloomberg terminal... and while overwhelming at first, it is a lot of simple commands that each get their own part of the screen.


[05-Feb-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The global chat channels (COMP GLOBAL and COMP HELP) are good places with wider audiances to ask questions too.


[05-Feb-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's also the discord ( https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz ) which can be easier to work with replies and screen shots.

**shagie**:	Couple years ago, had a manager with the last name corntved -- the 'rntv' with four consonants in a row was awkward.


[07-Feb-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(This also gets into interesting things with lingustic phonetics, Japanese for example is strictly CV (sometimes followed by an 'n') - you'll never have CCV or anything other than consonant vowel repeating.

**sztypettto**:	Harmonia doesn't have that many natural resources. Not worth fighting over plots. Setup factories on another planet where pioneering workforce exists and can grow

**Dangertech**:	So what happens for new players if all the plots fill up? Is another planet suggested as the starting planet?


[10-Feb-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	new players can always start on the planet, but others can't settle


[10-Feb-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, if you look at ZV-759c (Deimos) you will see a +59 there.  If you go to the 'Start a base' and look at the Plots / available plots - its 0.  You can't start a base there until there is an available plot... which requires 60 bases to be removed from inactivity.


[10-Feb-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	New players can start there (and continue to do so) just that you and I can't start a base there.

[11-Feb-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	what are those


[11-Feb-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	materials


[11-Feb-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	ah ok


[11-Feb-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	do you still have building mats?


[11-Feb-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	I have 11 BBH, 5 BDE, 9 BSE, 1 BTA, 208 MCG.


[11-Feb-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	Harmonica is a big farming planet.  You might want to do either water rigs or farmsteads


[11-Feb-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	ok


[11-Feb-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	I don't know what profession you chose.  I don't think it matters, though


[11-Feb-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	I have both 1 farmstead and 1 water rig maxed


[11-Feb-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Katinga**:	hmmm


[11-Feb-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	with just 1 rig and 1 farmstead, you should have only 80 workers


[11-Feb-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	it says in current workforce I have 200 pioneers


[11-Feb-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	?!


[11-Feb-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	I just finished the tutorial


[11-Feb-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	1 farmstead takes up 50 workers and a rig takes up 30


[11-Feb-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	Level	Required	Current Workforce	Capacity	Satisfaction Pioneers	80	200 (0)	200


[11-Feb-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	200 is what you can house


[11-Feb-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	ah


[11-Feb-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	each hab houses 100 pioneers


[11-Feb-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	I now only have 100 capacity


[11-Feb-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	for the 200 current workforce


[11-Feb-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	you have a workforce of 80


[11-Feb-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	every base starts with 200 PIO regardless of building demand. excess PIO are shed after POPR


[11-Feb-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	as long as you have housing for your required workforce don't worry about it

[11-Feb-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	1 FRM (farm), 1 FP (food processor), and 2 HB1 (PIO habitation) ... then additionally build 2 RIGs and another FRM.


[11-Feb-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	he doesn't have the mats atm, shagie


[11-Feb-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That should get a reasonable foothold - and if you don't have the stuff to make all of that now, make sure you follow the tutorial contracts which can give a number of additional resources.

**HP_chicken**:	Where and how can I buy stuff?


[11-Feb-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HP_chicken**:	And what is a production order


[11-Feb-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you can buy things by typing "CX AI1" in a new buffer.


[11-Feb-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	a production order is something made by your buildings. there is a production button on your base screen ("BS ZV-896b" in a new buffer)


[11-Feb-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	in that production button you just click "NEW ORDER" and choose something


[11-Feb-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	but it has to be something you have the materials on hand to make.  if it's a farm, you need water to grow something.


[11-Feb-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	a lot of productions require inputs


[11-Feb-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	but with this planet's COGC being Agriculture, farming something is a good choice.  Or run rigs to harvest water to sell off.


[11-Feb-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're after water... SE-110c is probably a better choice...


[11-Feb-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The water here costs 19 / unit to make.  That's still a long way from where DW.AI1 is though.


[11-Feb-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ice Station Alpha costs 15 / unit to make.


[11-Feb-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(This isn't a leave here and set up shop there, but rather a "if that's the industry you want to pursue, consider a base there... or Etherwind... or Boucher)


[11-Feb-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A rig here is only coming out about 450 credits / day in profit.


[11-Feb-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh my god shagie you had me freak tf out when you linked to DW.AI1 instead of H2O.AI1


[11-Feb-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i thought water went crazy all of a sudden


[11-Feb-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Growing HER.AI1 (for FIM.AI1 or KOM.AI1) can net more profit than H2O from here.


[11-Feb-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://universallogistics.app/building/FP (select AI1) - note that it may be better to buy the water, ship it in, and DW it rather than trying to scale up RIGs.


[11-Feb-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	at that point just go to norwick lol


[11-Feb-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	farm HER here, there's plenty of demand for it and it's good money.


[11-Feb-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	like shagie said


[11-Feb-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	13 FRM and just import H2O+DDT from ANT


[11-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion is my herb world - on the Circa - Proxion (stops in Moria, Kiruna, and extended service to Benten).  DDT goes one way, Herbs go the other.

[12-Feb-24 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatzeKattzen**:	Fuel Economy reasons


[12-Feb-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatzeKattzen**:	Probably a FRM then a second FP but that means buying a lotta water.


[12-Feb-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatzeKattzen**:	rig not enough to sustain production


[12-Feb-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	FRM water is not logistically intensive


[12-Feb-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	it's not hard to import


[12-Feb-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	the FRM profit, even after factoring in H2O and fuel costs, is more than what a RIG would save you. might seem weird but it's definitely better to buy the water

[13-Feb-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got some combination of BEA / (NUT or VEG) / (GRN or MAI) you can make some RAT. If you just have BEA you could do a single run of PPA.

[13-Feb-24 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DiStinkio**:	Can't run ppa


[13-Feb-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You are going to need some agri products.  Generally, these are made in a FRM (farm).  The tutorial contracts provide you with some starter goods.  If you don't have any agri products, you'll need to grow them (build a FRM) or buy them (in the CX - though note, if you are a farmer you should be setting up the infrastructure to grow them).


[13-Feb-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiStinkio**:	I have the recommended starter buildings. I am 10% along in growing beans and 7% with DW and H2O. I don't know how to make contracts


[13-Feb-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I believe the next step would be wait for the beans to finish growing then.


[13-Feb-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you do not have a warehouse at the CX, in CONTS you will have delivery contracts that can be fulfilled when you have a ship stationary at the CX.

[16-Feb-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@DiStinkio (since Harmonia chat has more persistance than global help) ... Making MEA.AI1 is a long process that requires an advanced food processing building (the IVP).  I wouldn't recommend going all the way to that end.


[16-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Making FIM.AI1 however, is something that can be done with the FRM and FP that you likely already have.


[16-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This would be done by buying DDT.AI1 at Antares and using that to grow HER (on a FRM) and then using the HER combined with a RAT in an FP.


[16-Feb-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I do not recommend doing this until you know you have surplus capacity for making RAT and DW from your current setup.


[16-Feb-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	1 DDT => 4 HER is a ~2 day run and if you don't have enough FRMs to produce BEA / NUT / GRN (or whatever mix you use) for the RAT, you'll be spending money on idle FPs.


[16-Feb-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The specifics of how many FRMs and FPs you should have before getting into HER and FIM - check that with Prun Planner.


[16-Feb-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That said, I do recommend looking at it once you get to the scale (it isn't too many... I think I had 3 or 4 FRMs when I did my first batch) as there's a lot of AIC to be made when doing that additional processing.


[16-Feb-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bumm3r**:	I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but every time I try to use prun planner, it just goes to a blank screen when I try to add a planet from the search function. Am I doing something wrong?

[21-Feb-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Find out what you can make cheaper, ship larger batches, go slower when shipping.


[21-Feb-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The prices of RAT are rather high, should be able to make about 70 ICA profit on each unit you sell with no difficulty (and 1 GRN + 1 BEA + 1 NUT = 10x RAT)


[21-Feb-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	For Carbon... the one ingredient burn, one FRM can supply two INCs.


[21-Feb-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN can grow on less water than HCP - and if you're just doing a 1 ingredient burn, its all the same... so grow GRN.


[21-Feb-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	wait so the recomendation was wrong? it said 2 farms and one inc


[21-Feb-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll want two farms... and you'll want a FP at some point too.


[21-Feb-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And if you go for faster burns (GRN + HCP or MAI + HCP), the ratios change.


[21-Feb-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Base times, you grow 4 GRN in 12 hours.  This changes based on other things, but that's the base time.


[21-Feb-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(you can find this information that I'm using in MAT GRN)


[21-Feb-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	This gets to a personally thing... I put down the rations first, but its not too much of an issue - just what you sell first.


[21-Feb-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I _personally_ like having my consumables covered before going to other things.


[21-Feb-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	kinda curious why building mats are not available on local market as they can be produced here on this planet


[21-Feb-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	or are they low demand


[21-Feb-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Self consume them ... and processing increases their value.


[21-Feb-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 4 FRMs going here, and 2 FPs and 2 RIGs... and I find it easier to sell the RAT than trying to sell C on world.


[21-Feb-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	i went carbon as saw a statement in ad saying its fastest to self sufficiency


[21-Feb-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	but seems to me no matter what route you need to trade at least when starting


[21-Feb-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.


[21-Feb-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Trying to make a base that does _everything_ gets to very low margins.


[21-Feb-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	why are you not running for gov?


[21-Feb-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd even move the FP off world here... but I don't like shipping food that far and I don't have any logistics capacity here.


[21-Feb-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Because I'm running for gov in Verdant.


[21-Feb-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	ah... is fuel expensive? just running to anteres station will use 20% of my LTL and 10% of my FTL on minimum


[21-Feb-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you don't need to spend it... its cheaper to go slow.


[21-Feb-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ballpark the fuel costs as 15 AIC per fuel.  Its high, but it makes the math easy.


[21-Feb-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its SF.AI1 and FF.AI1


[21-Feb-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Which isn't too far off.


[21-Feb-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	so around 1200AIC each way just for the STL


[21-Feb-24 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What if you kick that reactor slider all the way to the left?


[21-Feb-24 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	How much slower? How much cheaper?


[21-Feb-24 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(btw, on specalization - here's my Verdant base - https://i.imgur.com/L3Tv9NU.png )

[21-Feb-24 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	that was on minimum. said 39 units each way


[21-Feb-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	about 22 hours travel time each way


[21-Feb-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - looked at it... (blueprint test run) - so yep, its 126 SF... and that's a hardish number.


[21-Feb-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The takeoff and departure make up 75% of that.


[21-Feb-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm getting 11h for the trip... is that round trip you're looking at?


[21-Feb-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	is it possible to build space elevator?


[21-Feb-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	would cut down shipping costs


[21-Feb-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's on the dev's roadmap - they're thinking about it.

[21-Feb-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	11h 18m one way, 126 SF and 31 FF.


[21-Feb-24 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	way more expensive than me but with a very high mass


[21-Feb-24 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's a test with a fully loaded starter ship.


[21-Feb-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Are you sure you are going to the right location or haven't nudged the fuel use down a bit?


[21-Feb-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(nudging it all the way down isn't a bad thing... I tend to leave fuel use at the default setting)


[21-Feb-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	well i appreciate the help. but i need to sleep. working on getting new job and have to do some of it tomorrow.


[21-Feb-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Fair 'nuff.  One of the great things about the game - you don't need to _play_ it.


[21-Feb-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	MS ZV-307


[21-Feb-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Timining your ships to get in when you're able to attend to them... some spend as little as 10 - 15 min a day tending things.


[21-Feb-24 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	anteres station


[21-Feb-24 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - make sure you're heading to ANT for the destination and not the system orbit (which is way out there).


[21-Feb-24 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	i set to head straight to station


[21-Feb-24 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	wish you could extend travel and slow boat instead of jumping to save some credits


[21-Feb-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider the "parsecs per hour" time for FF travel...


[21-Feb-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	and consider plotting a "how long does it take to get from Sand (WB-675c) to Gasword (WB-675i)


[21-Feb-24 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They're even in the same system...


[21-Feb-24 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And if you take that slider to the slowest fuel setting... it takes 25 days.


[21-Feb-24 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PurgeRage40**:	ah... your right. for some reason my brain was thinking same system but just looked at system map


[21-Feb-24 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Antares space is... well, they like the name Antares.


[22-Feb-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Kind of like the Spanish.  Each time they found a new mountain range - Sierra Nevada.


[22-Feb-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sierra Nevada, Califonia.  Sierra Nevada Columbia, Sierra Nevada Venesuala, Sierra Nevada Spain...

[22-Feb-24 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got the fuel slider to minimum.  Not a bad thing, question of trade offs and timing.


[22-Feb-24 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Terrabitium**:	So. a free license player is not allowed to build ships, is that correct?


[22-Feb-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	If yes - how the hell am I gonna get new ones?


[22-Feb-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you get new ones with a PRO license lol


[22-Feb-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	but you won't need more than the ones you have for a considerable amount of time


[22-Feb-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	can you buy finished ones?  I thought everyone had to build their own ships by buying the parts and bringing them to a shipyard


[22-Feb-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you buy the parts and assemble them yourself


[22-Feb-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	correct


[22-Feb-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	there's no way to transfer finished ships


[22-Feb-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	it would be nice to buy new ones


[22-Feb-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	I need more than 2 ships with only ONE base.


[22-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	And I cant' buy more.


[22-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	Base on harmonia*


[22-Feb-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You should consider a base on Norwick (YK-649b)


[22-Feb-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've just got FP running here, you're not using the local water (and paying more for it from the CX).


[22-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're also not taking advantage of the CoGC (agriculture) which gives a 25% boost to performance of FRMs ... where Norwick has a 25% boost to food industry which includes the FP.


[22-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	Not yet. I got only 20 FPs on Harmonia.


[22-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	Which means im not good enough producer of cash/mats for well established second base YET


[22-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'd only need 16 FPs on Norwick to get the same performance of the 20 FPs on Harmonia.


[22-Feb-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	Does it matter if moving it to norwick will, probably, most likely, cost me more both long-term and short-term?


[22-Feb-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	I am close in money amnt to fill base with FPs. And then - to expand.


[22-Feb-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Spin it up in Prun Planner and check.  However, Harmonia is almost full and if you left you might not be able to get a base here again.


[22-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For the same infrastructure, you'd make an additional 20k AIC per day on Norwick.


[22-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	Moving to Norwick will cost me more than 20k AIC per day.


[22-Feb-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Terrabitium**:	anyway


[22-Feb-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**IronFist95**:	hi, im missing some essential resources for my pioneers, and i see it's reduced their satisfaction to 9.5%. and thus a efficiency of 11%. apart from that will anything else be impacted, will they start starving?

***IronFist95** deleted this message.*


[08-Mar-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	They will stop working if all consumables run out and may migrate away from the planet. Not starve AFAIK. Unemployed pioneers should replenish the worker numbers when you resupply. what are you missing?


[08-Mar-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	do luxury resources (increase satisfaction) and thus efficiency enough to warrant buying them?


[08-Mar-24 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	I've sent a ship to buy a 2 weeks worth from com market, first time doing it is all


[08-Mar-24 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	That is adifficult question to answer. It depends on what you are producting and in what amounts. There are some base planner tools available that can help you decide if you create your base in them.

[08-Mar-24 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	450% increase in cost sounds like a lot. Are you sure about that? For example 100 pioneers drink 0.5 COF a day, whic is (at current ask price) 387,5 AIC

[08-Mar-24 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	geez, mb, 50% increase in cost, much more reasonable


[08-Mar-24 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	how's the starter ships being able to carry 333 days of consumables sound? should be fine


[08-Mar-24 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	I would not invest that much money into a such a huge stockpile of consumables(you will need to make a trip to a CX multiple times in that time anyway), but it does not sound impossible to do.


[08-Mar-24 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	like lets say if you have 3 farmsteads, have it produce 3 different goods?


[10-Mar-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	Cause I noticed its a first come first serve sort of thing and that's slightly irritating.


[10-Mar-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When a production order completes, the next production order in the queue is picked up.


[10-Mar-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For FRMs, I've found that in general, if you set them so that they produce 12 items at a time, it takes about 24h to do that.


[10-Mar-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So 3x FRMs and queue of 12 BEA (2x6), 12 NUT (1x12), 12 GRN (3x4) will produce the right ratios at a rate of about 1 / day.


[10-Mar-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	Hmm interesting


[10-Mar-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	I think I might make that a suggestion to the devs at the same time but thank you


[10-Mar-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	there's an hour difference


[10-Mar-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnragedTribble**:	I do something similar for Carbon, I have 12 FRM and do 36 of each in 3 groups of 4 orders which take 3ish days and the 3 groups are staggered so one finishes every day an another starts. its MAI(x3) HCP twice (x9) and GRN (x9)


[10-Mar-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheRifleman**:	yeah it's just a lil weird


[10-Mar-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It should do the same thing - the key is to have the same ratios of items in the queue.


[10-Mar-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**FalconDestroyer**:	around how much is carbon worth?


[11-Mar-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FalconDestroyer**:	nvm, I figured it out


[11-Mar-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	C.AI1


[11-Mar-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Which is a 1:1 conversion (at cheapest) from GRN.AI1 (along with the workforce needs and building deprecation))


[11-Mar-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So you make about 400 AIC, less funds spent on RAT, DW, OVE, and BFabs for repairs.


[11-Mar-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The INC will cost about 110 AIC / day for repairs - and 4 GRN -> 4 C is 1 day.  The workforce cost for 4 GRN -> 4 C is about 560 AIC (so add on another 100 AIC to the price of the GRN for costs).  So 650 operational costs for ~165 AIC on top of the ~250 AIC = 415 AIC costs... and thus the C is 200 profit per unit.

**Motleykrube**:	So Shagie should I be growing GRN instead of HCP to feed into the INCs?


[13-Mar-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Correct.  GRN 1.H => 4G runs in 12h and is 0.25 H2O / GRN.


[13-Mar-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The equivelent HCP is 2 H2O => 4 HCP in 12h ... which uses twice as much water.


[13-Mar-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Granted, we're dealing with "1 unit of stuff is half of H2O.AI1 price difference" - but that's still money saved.


[13-Mar-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Motleykrube**:	Awesome. Thanks for the analysis! I appreciate your information here and on the Discord.

**ChrisPluto**:	Hi i have two orders in my product line and can not cancel the orders. Because the basic/ starting Material is missing.


[15-Mar-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	Did anyone know a solution for this problem. I guess it is a bug?


[15-Mar-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	I have read the wiki i try several menues but i could not find a solution


[15-Mar-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	So you click the 'cancel' button in the queue window and it does nothing?


[15-Mar-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	there is no cancel button in the window


[15-Mar-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	The firs place was empty in the list. It seems to be that the cancel button was only there when the first place was in progress


[15-Mar-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	In my waitlist is the first place empty, the second and third orders are waiting of basic materials, because of that the production could not start


[15-Mar-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChrisPluto**:	but no option to cancel this orders


[15-Mar-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	So where the 'cancel' button would normally be, there is just an empty box?

[18-Mar-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**helcelira**:	okay


[18-Mar-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nanacheesecakes**:	you should have started with enough resources to build annother building, but it will depend on what you chose


[18-Mar-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoobieScooby**:	i chose carbon farmer


[18-Mar-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**helcelira**:	With the occasional extra hydrogen from my own collectors


[18-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**helcelira**:	Did some quests as well


[18-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nanacheesecakes**:	@helcelira for the early game if you are making fuel then you will need to rely on buying from other players


[18-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**helcelira**:	alr


[18-Mar-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**helcelira**:	xd


[18-Mar-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nanacheesecakes**:	once you have a good income then you can build a second base on a different planet to get more resources yourself

[18-Mar-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**helcelira**:	If I temporarily remove a pioneer housing and replace it with barracks (I need some settlers) can I just demolish the thing and rebuild or I have to build the barracks first or I will lost my pops


[18-Mar-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**helcelira**:	Also is it suggested or not that I do the scientific planet exploration quests because I noticed that they are a bit expensive in fuel or will the funds usually refund me

**lukeskye**:	I believe that when a hab is demolished the workers will stay until the next report.

[20-Mar-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Carbon farmer is good too. I would personally encourage a diversified base if the profits are similar so that a bear market in one industry doesn't seriously impact income.


[20-Mar-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you pull up CXPC C.AI1 (90 days) you can see that it has its ups and downs.  People who planned their base based on profits from December were sad in late January.


[20-Mar-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Or look at C.NC1 price chart 90 days and you can see that downward trend)


[20-Mar-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I reduced my burning in January to cheaper / slower runs because the per unit profit getting close to the triple burn costs at 550 NCC.


[20-Mar-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But (for me) C is "only" part of my revenue - I made more food, and started up things that consumed the C I made that weren't as impacted by the great C Bear of early '24.

[20-Mar-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(side bit - when talking about this, I'm going to use the following terms so that I say exactly what I mean to say:  A buffer is a floating window.  A screen is a configured set of tiles accessed through 'SCRN' at the top bar.  A tile is a subdivision of a buffer or a screen.)

**IronFist95**:	indeed, the govenor has now payed for the COGC


[28-Mar-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	wouldnt that mean that the govenor has enough farming to warrant paying for it themself?


[29-Mar-24 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	That's the scam


[29-Mar-24 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IronFist95**:	@caskman, is that a safe assumption, you have enough farms here that the 25% increase to farm prod makes you enough maney to cover the cost of the COGC?


[29-Mar-24 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'd say the 25% increase might come close to covering that, depending on the way you calculate or look at it. But as governor he gets taxes from production and warehouse fees, putting that towards population infrastructure and chamber of global commerce upkeep

**_sashkaa**:	despite the prices


[29-Mar-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Alternative take on COF and PWO - if it _isn't_ worth it to buy for given base, the base can be configured to do something else more profitably.


[29-Mar-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The only time when I encountered COF not being worth it was when I started a base on Proxion (with awful water) and put down rigs.  Adding COF made the rigs from 2 H2O / cycle to 2.2 H2O / cycle.  The solution: tear up all the rigs and buy water at the CX.

**NysileVerazi**:	A single permit gtes you 500 space on a new base, or 250 additional space on your current base.


[29-Mar-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NysileVerazi**:	A new base costs money for the CM though, whereas an expansion does not


[29-Mar-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, and as to which is better, it depends on your situation. If a base is very profitable, has an excess of supply or you need the product for something else, then a permit could be a good choice.

[05-Apr-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Wo ich Hilfe brauche, greife ich auf die Übersetzung zurück, sonst habe ich vor 20 Jahren Deutsch gelernt.

[05-Apr-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Hey iich habe doch auch keine Ahnung. xD Habe erst vor ein paar Tagen angefangen


[05-Apr-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	wenn ich helfen kann helfe ich gerne, aber ich kann auch nicht 24/7 in dem Game abhängen


[05-Apr-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	lolol


[05-Apr-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Alles Gute, Mann. Nur freundliches Geplänkel. Willkommen im Spiel. Immerhin wurde es von einer deutschen Firma hergestellt.


[05-Apr-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Ich weiß. Von nur 4 Leuten. Genau wie AirlineSim. Sehr beeindruckend.


[05-Apr-24 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Genau! Die meisten Spiele, die in Deutschland hergestellt werden, werden von einem kleinen Team produziert. Lobenswertes Engagement. Es ist nicht einfach, ein Spiel zu machen. Erfordert Fachwissen in vielen Bereichen.


[05-Apr-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Da kann ich dir in allen Punkten zustimmen


[05-Apr-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Ich habe gestern in Spanien Malaga meine Airline in AS gegründet. Das liegt ja nah an Portugal


[05-Apr-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Wow! Wirklich?


[05-Apr-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Ja


[05-Apr-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	der Name ist: Fuera de Malaga


[05-Apr-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	xD


[05-Apr-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Allerdings ist es, wenn man ehrlich ist, jemandem aus Portugal von Spanien zu erzählen, so, als würde man einen Deutschen mit dem N-Wort bezeichnen :P


[05-Apr-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Echt? xD


[05-Apr-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Möchte man nicht mit Spanien verglichen werden?


[05-Apr-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	eher als würde man einem Deutschen von der Schweitz erzählen


[05-Apr-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Cool Name für eine Airline. Ich habe nur einige Screenshots von diesem Spiel gesehen. Obwohl ich vor 20 Jahren Airport Tycoon 1, 2 und 3 gespielt habe. Und davor habe ich Aerobiz gespielt. So ein wunderschönes Spiel mit unzähligen Stunden und vielen Erinnerungen.


[05-Apr-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Spanien ist ein völlig anderes Land und eine völlig andere Kultur, auch wenn wir eine gemeinsame Geschichte haben. Sie sind unser Nachbar. Wir pflegen unseren eigenen Raum. Aber was habt ihr gegen die Schweiz? Mögen Sie ihre Schokolade oder das verbotene Gold nicht? xD


[05-Apr-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Bilder von Aerobiz sehen schön aus. Mit viel liebe gemacht.


[05-Apr-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Der Airline Name soll ein kleiner Witz sein und "Raus aus Malaga" oder "Außerhalb Malagas" heißen.


[05-Apr-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Oh!!! Ich kann dir nicht sagen, was für eine Freude es war, das zu spielen, als ich jung war. Ich und mein Bruder haben es zusammen gespielt. Seine Musik war ein Meisterwerk. Ein ganz besonderer Ort in unseren Herzen.


[05-Apr-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archer7**:	Ich habe nichts gegen die Schweitz. Ich meinte das nur weil es auch nachbarn sind


[05-Apr-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mirakaetzchen**:	Moin zusammen. / Good morning everybody


[06-Apr-24 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mirakaetzchen**:	Ich kann mir das mit Spanien/Portugal vorstellen. Wohne quasi direkt an der Deutsch/Niederlandischen/Belgischen Grenze. Man sieht sofort den unterschied in den Häusern/Einkaufsmärkten. Ganz krass ist manchmal der unterschied im verhalten der leute. Viele die über die grenze kommen zum einkaufen erkennt man sofort.

**shagie**:	If you ever find a copy of it, https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/222/space-beans is a fairly fun game.

Space Beans
Collect sets of intergalactic beans, but don't collect more than you can sell!

[20-Apr-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Very much so.  Even things to do now with identifying the resource demands for a given setup.  Prun Planner is very helpful on that front.

**Akyan**:	I've almost my first ship reaching the market... bought some water to bring back to carry on carbon production.. don't want to run out.


[21-Apr-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You may want to consider building a RIG which will let you produce water locally.


[21-Apr-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It costs 12 BSE (and some MCG) and requires 30 POI workers.


[21-Apr-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I thought that, but initially the initial contract from the faction seemed to expect me to buy parts to build a second incinerator


[21-Apr-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'll see if I have enough to buy the parts for the rig too


[21-Apr-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Yeah, a little too much, will need to save for a bit longer to get enough for the BSE. Actually may have enough once the contracts go through as they give me currency.


[21-Apr-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	instantly. Albeit at the commodity exchange if you have a warehouse or ship already there.


[24-Apr-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Make stuff (primarily agricultural products here).  Refine them (it adds a lot of value) to either basic rations (RAT.AI1) or carbon (C.AI1).  Load them up on a ship and ship 'em to Antares station.  Sell them there.  Buy stuff you need, repeat.


[24-Apr-24 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**_sashkaa**:	rather, you get more cash from buiding FRMs than building INCs


[25-Apr-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Exactly


[25-Apr-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	And that's the reason I stress that a number of players here mislead newcomers to make carbon and agriculture for them


[25-Apr-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	without realising that many of the players suggesting them are manipulating the prices in the market


[25-Apr-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have GRN.AI1 ... C.AI1 is a 2x upgrade on sell price.


[25-Apr-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN itself costs me 81 credits to make (cost of water, cost of workforce, building repairs)


[25-Apr-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With GRN at 81, C costs 230 to make (4 GRN -> 4 C) ... and 81 -> 244 is 163 profit.  For C, that is 375 profit.  More than twice as much as the GRN sale.


[25-Apr-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Even if you price the GRN at 244, C costs 393 to make... and _still_ profitable to do.


[25-Apr-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Carbon is profitable to make.  How a particular setup compares with making RAT... that gets into some more accounting and trade offs.  RAT is also profitable to make.


[25-Apr-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll also point out that the "is it the best thing to make _now_" depends on the prices now... and we also get into the bullwhip effect.


[25-Apr-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**_sashkaa**:	heyy hey


[26-Apr-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	yes, but how much profit per day does an INC do when compared to FRM?


[26-Apr-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A FRM growing GRN (and selling that GRN directily (note: 103 units of GRN.AI1 traded today) would make approximately 2000 / day.  Note that Verdant produces 113 per day for me.


[26-Apr-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	An INC adds another 1600 / day based on buying GRN at 200 (rather than internal costs) and takes 1/3 the space of a FRM.  In the same space as a FRM you can build three buildings that produce 4800 / day total _on top of_ the value of the FRM.


[26-Apr-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There have been 5523 units of C.AI1 sold today.


[26-Apr-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	According to XIT FIN, Verdant (3 permits) produces 77k profit.  Frost (mostly INC) produces 36k profit on one permit.


[26-Apr-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I am personally and advocate for diversification.  I've got 6x INCs going on Frost.  3x FER and 22x FP on Sand.  12x FRMs and an ORC on Proxion.  23x FRMs on Verdant.  The revenue from C and further product lines that use it is a nice part to my total revenue.

**caskman**:	Hello everyone, as governor I am trying out an investment initiative.  For companies that were founded within the last 90 days with a base on Harmonia I am offering 200k AIC stable loans at 1% interest over a 6 month period.  At minimum this requires a BASIC license.  Please DM me if you're interested, however since I'm trying this out I'm only giving out loans to the first 10 people who reach out


[30-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Sounds like predatory investment and loan shark scheme


[30-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	What happens to corporations that are unable to payback?


[30-Apr-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	you get booted off the planet


[30-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	jking, we can work it out.  Otherwise if it becomes evident you can't payback then I just won't give you loans in the future


[30-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	*can't or won't payback


[30-Apr-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	I figured 1% interest made it not predatory, especially over a 6 month period


[30-Apr-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	Also the system is weighted better towards the lendee here, if you take the money and run then you get a rating hit for just one contract regardless of the amount


[30-Apr-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lampr**:	1% is very generous. i did a loan early on at 3%. but even that was great as it catapults you forward


[30-Apr-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	That sounds very genours of you indeed, I wish you the best in this initiative.


[30-Apr-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I would recommend checking out the borrower's business plan/strategy in mind before giving them the loan


[30-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	@sztypettto if someone is unable to pay back 200k over 6 MONTHS then I'd call that a massive failure as a PrUn player lmao


[30-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	But yeah having a business plan is a good recommendation.


[30-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	@MoonSugar not every player in PU is an economics/business mastermind


[30-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	A lot of people just like real life get lured by the prospect of getting free money to fund their bad choices


[30-Apr-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	A good business will grow


[30-Apr-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	A bad business person will make bad choices at a larger scale


[30-Apr-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	That's why I called it loan shark


[30-Apr-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	If the lender does due diligence and refuses to lend the money to people who aren't eligible. Then it's a good scheme


[30-Apr-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	That's why this is a trial run with a max of 10 companies to start, if too many people cut and run then I may not do it again


[30-Apr-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Well it's not a loan shark if it's the borrower's fault, right? Shark, at 1%? :p


[30-Apr-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	If you give money to someone who can't/won't payback, as the lender you end up in the situation of then leaning towards doing unpleasant things to them.


[30-Apr-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Let bad businesses fail


[30-Apr-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Help good businesses scale


[30-Apr-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Relaxxx it's just 2 mil ;P Sure it'd be annoying in the unlikely event that everyone runs with the money, but I'm sure @caskman won't go bankrupt himself ;) (But yeah, asking them for a business plan is a good idea on many levels.)


[30-Apr-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	if we're talking about smart business practices then what I'm trying to do is really dumb, I can get a much better return with this money by expanding


[30-Apr-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	No, we're talking about making the receivers of your loans follow smart business practices :)

**Akyan**:	tbh, in some ways taking it slow at the start (without a cash injection) can be good. Lots of time to reflect on each move of expansion while you're learning the ropes.


[30-Apr-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I think you'd want to have a clear plan before taking up such an offer.

**Saxi**:	oh that was @caskman doing the loans mb


[30-Apr-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saxi**:	loans would be handy if I want to do repairs all at the same time. Can keep cash employed and when the big cash outflow of repairs hits take out a line of credit to take care of those..


[30-Apr-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Saxi - indeed.  Though, one of the corresponding dangers is the "seeking alpha" perspective which has players jumping to higher tier products... this does in turn create demand for lower tier goods, but I'm also sure you've heard "C is too expensive" in the past.


[30-Apr-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It is amusing that a number of players that I regularly interact with are going back to the "basics".  People showing up on agri worlds... because they need a reliable source of RAT and C.

**svinyabog**:	hi guys new to prosperous universe here, for starters (carbon farmer) do u recommend to build a rig to keep a supply of h2o or to keep buying h2o in the commodity exchange for now?


[02-May-24 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	@svinyabog I haven’t done the math on this recently, but I think you’d be better off buying h2o at the CX. Extracting your own water is cheaper, but it’s probably more profitable to use that land to grow more carbon. Welcome to Prun :)


[02-May-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lampr**:	i did yesterday. scraped 9 rigs for more INC. i also shipped over 20k water, so i don't have to think about it. in the start it's nice not having to run back and forth from the CX for just water


[02-May-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	That’ll keep your farms happy for a long time. It’s really nice once you finally have the money to stock up consumables :)


[02-May-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lampr**:	indeed. at the start on of your highest cost is fuel. even shipping with the lowest fuel usage it's still costly


[02-May-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	thank you for the answers, yea fuel is my biggest concern for now so id like to be more autonomous, as of now i have 2 pioner settlements 2 farmestead that produce more than my only inc can burn to produce carbon, for that reason i was thinking of building 1 water rig to keep me supplied and one food production facility since it uses the same matersials my inc uses and i need to have rations obviously. But being it my second day maybe im taking a blunder


[02-May-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Have you been introduced to prunplanner? If not, take a look at https://prunplanner.org/


[02-May-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	I suspect that building more inc would be financially optimal - but you can play around with this and see what makes sense. Again, I suspect that you’ll earn more money from burning more carbon than you’d save from making your own rations


[02-May-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	no now ill take a look thank u, yea couldnt really figure out what was going to be more effiecient, a higly specialized production or an all rounder self sufficient base, economy theory suggests the first one but we will have to see


[02-May-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-May-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My read on that is that someone needed C yesterday and the supply had gotten eaten up in the previous day (the baby bull steps had more goods moving than the one that pushed it to 1000)


[15-May-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And with the "nothing between 600 and 100" if you need a few hundred C, you buy a few hundred C.  The average price at that time would be interesting.  I suspect the mean for that purchase was closer to 750 to 800... and the lack of supply in on the book shot it up high for people listing "unreasonable" prices that may someday happen.


[15-May-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With the previous support at 600 gone, the next round number is where people list it.  700


[15-May-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My crystal ball says that it will stay at 700 for a while while people hold out on buying (the gaps in the volume part of the chart).


[15-May-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As they hold out, the price will slowly come back down to the previous value of 600 over a few weeks.  Note that this all crystal ball reading and I could be 100% wrong.  Do not take investment advice from a guy who calls himself "shagie"  or "Jim Cramer".


[15-May-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	yea i dont see it staying at 700+ , people might start buying from other markets where the price is still 590/600


[15-May-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	honestly dont have enough experience with this game to know how convenient that is in terms of fuel expenses tho


[15-May-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Depends on the ship and how far.


[15-May-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got a WCB you can move 1000 C.  That's a nice number and a lot of people have it.


[15-May-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So if you were going to move C from Antares West I mean C.IC1 here and resell it at 650, that's 50 credits on the unit... which is 1000 units... which is 50,000 AIC.


[15-May-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That covers a lot of fuel.


[15-May-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got a starter ship, that's only 222 units you can move.  11k credits.


[15-May-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The "problem" with this is that 1000 C.IC1 means you need 600k credits to do that to make 50k credits profit.


[15-May-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	yea so hortus price will ramp up and our will lower


[15-May-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its also you need a bit of capital to sink in there for a while.  And what happens if you bought 600k worth of C.IC1 and others have the same idea and it gets pushed down to 610 here... and now you're only making 10 credits on the unit for a "measly" 10k.


[15-May-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	then you have to be faster and consume more fuel, but that lower even more the margit of profit, kind of risky affair without much gain now that i think of it


[15-May-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got the cash and the patience ... it may eventually pay off.  Eventually can be a while.


[15-May-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 715 listed at 650 on NC1 from a while back... but there's a good 2000 and some listed below me.

**RiseofFilth**:	Farms require a planet with fertility. Hydroponics do not. Planets with goodish fertility are rare. There are resources that only farms can produce. Therefore, it’s best to use planets like harmonia for farm-exclusive growing, and neighboring planets like life for hydroponics. And source water from somewhere, like Boucher


[16-May-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	or the CX


[16-May-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	or ice station alpha


[16-May-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	But of course you can build HYFs here if that works in a short term plan, then move it to some non-fertile planet that nonetheless has an agri bonus. We made something like this in FK-794 system


[16-May-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	yea i was looking at ice station to establish a hydroponic farm once i have enough money, but still not sure how convenient that is, ill focus on the base in harmonia first i guess


[16-May-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I would suggest avoiding structures on planets that don’t match the local COGC. Lose a lot of efficiency and profit margin that way


[16-May-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-24 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	whats the best way? make more collectors or is there an alternative, like increasing efficiency?


[19-May-24 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	you can use resource extraction expert, luxury goods, mathcing CoGC bonus.


[19-May-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	Harmonia has an Agriculture CoGC bonus. So producing fuel won't match that


[19-May-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	im new, so other than luxury goods, most of that is going over my head. how do i get resource extraction experts? and what is CoGC bonus?


[19-May-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	no worries


[19-May-24 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	CoGC is the Center of Global Commerce, every month we can vote on which program we want run at the CoGC and currently it benefits Agriculture.


[19-May-24 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	Experts naturally accumulate at your base over time as you run a production


[19-May-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	your base can have 6 total with a max of 5 of one type


[19-May-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	ah ok thanks.


[19-May-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	other than using a collector, anyway else i can produce hydrogen?


[19-May-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	usually now i purchase from the CX


[19-May-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	nope just COL to get H


[19-May-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	ah ok, i was hoping i could make it out of water or something...


[19-May-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	yeahhh that would be cool, but nope :(


[19-May-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	Also every planet has different levels of a resource available, so if you were to go to a planet where H is more abundant you would harvest more


[19-May-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	i guess i really jumped the gun by making a second refinery. should have made another collector first


[19-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	in my opinion, starting out making fuel on Harmonia is not the easiest


[19-May-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	but ultimately you play how you want


[19-May-24 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	but also I don't think it was a bad idea to build a REF, when starting out it is easier to buy inputs from the commodity exchange than to make them yourself


[19-May-24 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	ah ok thanks. yea, i think a seond refinery maybe was a better option. its just the struggle of finding the raw materials


[19-May-24 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shihido**:	thanks for the advice Hal


[19-May-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	@svinyabog It lacks good instruction/tutorials for new players, and the devs have completely refused to make changes that are essential for it to be treated as an MMO rather than a coop game in 95% of gameplay. And its numbers get lower and lower every year. Do not recommend. X4, on the other hand, just got a multiplayer mod, been playing that and having fun of late. Also, Scam citizen has actually put out enough content that it might not be a scam anymore, and there is persistant progress and missions


[19-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	I always imagined that game would be retro by the time it, maybe, actually releases


[19-May-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**svinyabog**:	is starcitizen actually playable? all videos i ve watched seemed more of a starships showcase


[19-May-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

Bullwhip effect
The bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon where orders to suppliers tend to have a larger variability than sales to buyers, which results in an amplified demand variability upstream. In part, this results in increasing swings in inventory in response to shifts in consumer demand as one moves further up the supply chain. The concept first ...

[22-May-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Over time, diversify.  Don't make a "do everything" base because that base will have very low margins (or even costs more to make the goods than you can buy them for on the CX).


[22-May-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Use Prun Planner to identify what the costs for production are - and what the current (!) best products to make are.

**shagie**:	In the "if you want it and have a PRO license..." list it on the LM and note that you have done so (if any that do).  It takes a fair amount of the pre part of time off.


[26-May-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Another approach would be buy some at the CX, and put a shipping contract up to bring it here.  That saves half the trip on small loads.


[26-May-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-May-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	upgrade HQ - then go to the BS (base) buffer to add the permit


[30-May-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've only used one permit (less than 500 area base), the BS command will allow you to allocate your second permit (you start with 2) to Harmonia.

**Elorik**:	Hello guys,  I have a question concerning Contracts. This is my first time. We both have a Pro license, and my only base is located here, in Harmonia.  A friend needs drinking water. I created a contract with "Provisioning of X units of Drinking Water @ Antares II – Deimos," which is his base location.  My ship arrived at Deimos. My friend is able to fulfill the "Payment of X AIC" line, but I'm not able to fulfill the "Provisioning of X units" line.  I tried with my ship both in orbit and landed, but it’s the same thing.  Does anyone have an idea about that? Thanks in advance!


[03-Jun-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Hey @Elorik - you'll need to rent a warehouse on Deimos to provision the DW. You're not able to do that just from the ship alone.

**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	I have my starter ships based at ZV-896b, not in orbit, and my contract says the pickup is at ZV-896b yet the furfill button is grey out. I can't figure out why


[07-Jun-24 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jun-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jun-24 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	@sztypettto unrated can't interact with local markets. Gotta buy the pro license once for the minimum term to get by that paywall


[08-Jun-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Or you get a voucher for Pro for someone, but once that lapses you fall back to Free license, not Basic. Basic can always accept local shipping ads, but can only post them at CXs.


[08-Jun-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	for=from


[08-Jun-24 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	But that limitation can be worked around by chatting on the local chat, since with basic you can still accept (“close”) any contract with a player as long as they issue it, be it local or directly to you.

[09-Jun-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At Antares station (ANT as a flight destination) you can buy / sell anything.


[09-Jun-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example MCG.AI1 or BSE.AI1 or BBH.AI1


[09-Jun-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you pull up 'CX AI1' in a new buffer you can the buy/sell screens for anything (also from 'CXL' on the left hand bar, and then click on Antares Station Commodity Exchange)


[09-Jun-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	I made buy orders but It doens't look like any purchase is being made


[09-Jun-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	I sent one of my ships to the Antares station

**shagie**:	What did you try to buy?


[09-Jun-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	Construction materials; BSE, BBH, BDE, BTA and MCG


[09-Jun-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	Maybe I'm just not offering enough money for the deal?


[09-Jun-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	Since there are more demands than supplies


[09-Jun-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't see anything in CXOB BSE.AI1


[09-Jun-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... at least nothing from your company name.


[09-Jun-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Check 'CONTS' for delivery contracts waiting for you to pick them up.


[09-Jun-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	It says Status: Filled on the order


[09-Jun-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I would suggest renting a warehouse at Antares Station - it makes it easier to think about what is where.  Pull up 'WAR ANT' in a new buffer, click 'Rent Unit' (its 100 AIC per week) and then you can deliver stuff you buy to the warehouse instead of having it sitting in forgotten delivery contracts.


[09-Jun-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	I did rent a warehouse there, but since I had my ship located and Antares I select that as the deposit


[09-Jun-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	:(


[09-Jun-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Your goods are _somewhere_.  The selector in CXPO is confusing about what it does (frankly, I ignore it).  You can always buy and sell from the CX - you don't have to be "there" with a ship.


[09-Jun-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Epidius**:	Thanks

**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Anyone who owns some ships with big cargo cap, I've posted some shipping ads on the Antares station LM totalling 17,000 AIC


[09-Jun-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Check it out, pricing feedback is welcomed btw. DM me if you want a contract issued privately


[09-Jun-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The ads are from KI-401d to ANT and have nothing to do with Harmonia so I'm not sure why you're advertising them here


[09-Jun-24 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Also, you're not paying very well especially considering it's likely a special trip with an empty ship out pretty far away.


[09-Jun-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	What's your ballpark price recommendation?


[09-Jun-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	10 credits per ton if there's reliable backhaul.  20 credits per ton if there isn't.  That's a starting point.


[09-Jun-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One way is 133x SF.AI1 and 85x FF.AI1


[09-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Alone, that's 3250 credits for fuel with no profit margin on top of that.

[09-Jun-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	1750 credits profit on one way is slim - there are better routes ... and there's no backhaul.  I'd start off at 10,000 credits which is only 3500 credits profit on the route.  You might want to up that to 12,000 credits a load.


[09-Jun-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and looking at it ... ouch... event Verdant to Moria is 3300 fuel costs now...)


[09-Jun-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, fuel got expensive. My usual fuel cost estimation got upped to 16 currency.


[09-Jun-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Thanks Shagie, appreciate the breakdown. I'll take another look at my ads


[09-Jun-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Oops payload doesn't make a profit anymore w revised prices ahaha


[09-Jun-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	I don't suppose there's a way to rent a space moving truck in this game?


[10-Jun-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Nope.


[10-Jun-24 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Only one commodity per contract, no blank tonnage shipping.


[10-Jun-24 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	No, I meant actually being able to rent a ship to temporarily control as part of your fleet. Like a space U-haul


[10-Jun-24 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Most new players have plenty of spare shipping capacity. It's not until you get closer to 4 or 5 bases that you even need to consider upgrading your starter ships.

[10-Jun-24 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Eh, it depends on your bases and locations. There's an argument to be made for opportunity cost (a WCB ship upgrade costs about as much as a one permit, fully green base), but there's also playstyle. A bigger cargo capacity can defray a lot of the logistics issues that would otherwise keep you busy shipping.

**Zekter**:	Hai spacefarers can anyone pick up my stranded spaceship on benten and deliver to antares IV 869b where my base is located? 06/10 06:46 PM Zekter any help would be appreciated


[10-Jun-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Uh... shipping ships is not possible. What is possible is buying fuel at Benten and flying your ship home yourself. Since you're on a Free license, you're restricted from trading with players directly, and trading on the FX, so unless you got stuff to sell at Benten I don't know how you'd get the required currency to buy fuel. Except for flying your other ship to Benten and selling stuff there.


[10-Jun-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	I have purchased FTL fuel on Benten and it is in ships cargo hold


[10-Jun-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	but cant trasfer or unload to tank of same ship


[10-Jun-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Do you have a storage at Benten?


[10-Jun-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	If so, transfer it from cargo hold to Benten storage.


[10-Jun-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Then from Benten storage to FTL fuel.


[10-Jun-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You open the ship fuel tank by SHPF (registry number of your ship)


[10-Jun-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	rented a warehouse at benton and transferred from ship to warehouse


[10-Jun-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	but still cant see the ftl icon pop up for transfer


[10-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	tried shpf


[10-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	On FLT screen, click FUEL for your ship.


[10-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Far right.


[10-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	ok


[10-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	..


[10-Jun-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	done


[10-Jun-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Now move FTL fuel from storage to fuel.


[10-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	I cant see storage icon in cargo hold it just says " UNLOAD "


[10-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	iam on free license


[10-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	If you move FF, FUEL should light up either green or red rectangles.


[10-Jun-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	or cant see ftl fuel icon in warehouse


[10-Jun-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Okay, different approach. Keep FUEL buffer open. New buffer: INV


[10-Jun-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	ship inv or warehouse inv on benten ?


[10-Jun-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	This lists all your inventories, for ships, bases, and warehouse.


[10-Jun-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Open inventory for warehouse unit Benten Station


[10-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	sure


[10-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Open inventory for ship.


[10-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Cargo inventory for ship, sorry.


[10-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Hit UNLOAD in cargo inventory.


[10-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	but it is not unloading to ships fuel tank..


[10-Jun-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	This only unloads the cargo in the cargo hold, not fuel tanks.


[10-Jun-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ships have three inventories: cargo, FTL fuel, STF fuel.


[10-Jun-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You can't move from Cargo to STL or FTL unless the ship is on a planet or docket do a station.


[10-Jun-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	its in benten and docked and stationery


[10-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	and some fuel is in benten warehouse that i have rented


[10-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	ship is stranded


[10-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	And you have FF (FTL fuel) either in Cargo or in Benten warehouse?


[10-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	How much fuel do you have?


[10-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Very unlikely, but you might have a display problem, website is badly loaded. Try to refresh / reload the page.


[10-Jun-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	both warehouse and ships cargo hold FTL 32 needed FTL 123 to flyback to base


[10-Jun-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	I am using phone internet tethering to browse on my pc


[10-Jun-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Phone tethering is not the problem.


[10-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	i reloaded the page just now


[10-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	no change


[10-Jun-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Hm. Okay, did you buy only 32 FTL fuel? Or did you buy more?


[10-Jun-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	I bought 100 fuel since already have 32 ftl


[10-Jun-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Because having the same number is odd.


[10-Jun-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Okay, new buffer: CXOS


[10-Jun-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	It will show you all the orders you have and had at the various CXs.


[10-Jun-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Maybe you didn't buy all the FTL fuel, only partway. Rest is a new bux order?


[10-Jun-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	thanks geraldivar nobody fulfiiled the order. I thought i had them


[10-Jun-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You need two buffers open: SHPF (ship registry number), INV (Benten Station) or INV (ship cargo hold).


[10-Jun-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	i checked CXOS


[10-Jun-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	iam going to cancel order and place new one


[10-Jun-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	geraldivar u r great help see u soon in galaxy


[10-Jun-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, you put a buy order then. Delete the buy order (the money is stuck there until you do), buy for more expensive price. CX pays the least amount possible, so if you put 200 CIS, it will still only pay 15 or so per fuel.


[10-Jun-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You're welcome.


[10-Jun-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	where should i get the fuel


[10-Jun-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	i cant place ad because iam U grade


[10-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	No.


[10-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You buy at Benten.


[10-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	For CIS. CIS is Benten currency.


[10-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zekter**:	thanks man .. sure take care


[10-Jun-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	New buffer, CXPO FF.CI1


[10-Jun-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	That way you buy at Benten.


[10-Jun-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zekter**:	but the fuel icon is not showing


[10-Jun-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zekter**:	that means i have to cancel order

**Zekter**:	is there anyplace i can buy directly without placing buy order


[10-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Saxi**:	dang how is influence calculated?


[12-Jun-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For COGC voting, it is a weighted by workforce tier.  PIO have 1 influence.  I have 800 PIO working here, so I have 800 influence on COGC voting.


[12-Jun-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For gov voting, its 1 player 1 vote - I have one vote to cast for gov.


[12-Jun-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I will point out that for gov on a starter world it can be necessary to let the planet's POPI / COGC "borrow" money from you from time to time.  Verdant has owed me up to 250k NCC at one point.  Right now, Verdant only owes me 32k NCC.  Being able to have sufficient liquidity to be able to cover that on a week to week basis is important for starter world.

Home on Lagrange (The L5 Song)
"Home on Lagrange (The L5 Song)" is a filk song, written in 1977 by William S. Higgins and Barry D. Gehm, intended to be sung to the tune of Home on the Range. It was inspired by the idea of placing large, self-contained space colonies into stable equilibrium at the L4 or L5 Lagrange points, which had been advocated by Gerard O'Neill.  The song'...

[20-Jun-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Define "not seeing". It should be measurable, and you should see it in the efficiency breakdown in the "new order" buffer.


[20-Jun-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	It's not coming up as it's own line item as luxury good or caffeinated infusion or anything. Might be because I'm on mobile though?


[20-Jun-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	mobile is a bit...different, but you can see it in the workforce buffer (WF) or via the base screen, tap workforce


[20-Jun-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You can get there by the base tile, if I remember correctly, but I modified mine with fitting cards. Go BASE BUILDING -> BASES -> VIEW BASE -> PRODUCTION -> DETAILS (on FRM, FP, RIG, since they’re probably the relevant production queues) you’ll see the total efficiency, on NEW ORDER you’ll see a breakdown of the efficiency factors. Without luxuries like COF and PWO the pioneers will work at reduced efficiency (of 79%). Only with luxuries do they get to 100%.

**Arctarus**:	When you build a new habitation, does it automatically come with full workers or do you need to hire them somehow?


[21-Jun-24 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	it should automatically "hire" them as the population becomes available


[21-Jun-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	in a buffer if you type POPR ZV-896b


[21-Jun-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	you can see how many of each pop there is here on Harmonia


[21-Jun-24 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Oh, so theres only so many of each worker type on each planet?


[21-Jun-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	yup


[21-Jun-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	Pioneers are pretty simple to get


[21-Jun-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Is there a way to make more or do they need to be moved from planet to planet?


[21-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	so every week the POPR updates and new pop moves to the planet


[21-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	or gets educated and ranks up


[21-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Cool. Thanks


[21-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	so the last update here was on the 19th


[21-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	so give it 5 or so days and then your base will have its full pop


[21-Jun-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	some people will check POPR before they make a base or an expansion to see if there is enough pop to support their base


[21-Jun-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	if they see it won't then they will wait to make the base until just before the next POPR comes out


[22-Jun-24 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	For pioneers there are 230k employed on the planet, with an unemployment rate of 9%, so the reserve pool is 20k, give or take. If you were to build a farm (BBC ZV-896b), you see "Pioneers 50 (2090)". That means out of the 50 you need, 2090 are readily available for instant allocation. If you overdraw by wanting to build something more high tech, like an in vitro plant IVP, those numbers are "Technicians 70 (20)". So out of the 70 you’d need, only 20 would be filled. Incidentally, there are only 540 TEC on Harmonia, and 40% of those are unemployed (216 people), which with the 10% instant allocation factor (so one person can’t hog all unemployed for their base) builds up to the 20 TEC available for the IVP in the example.

[23-Jun-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	You'll continually get faction missions which may have useful rewards. the exploration survey ones are basically never worth doing though


[23-Jun-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	They are tasks where you take your ship, fly it to that planet, land on it, fulfill that survey request, and depart again. Don’t forget the hitting fulfill part, that is essential.


[23-Jun-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	What you can do is hoard all the survey missions that don’t have a timer (see "due" column being empty) and try to see if you’ll get a matching pair.

**Geraldivar**:	Might take a while, though.


[23-Jun-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Incidentally, if you accumulate two survey quests for the same system, check the flight times from planet x to planet y beforehand. Due to orbital mechanics there’s a moderate chance that flying out of the system and jumping back in in much cheaper in fuel  and/or time.


[23-Jun-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	They all are for different systems. A few of them don't have deadlines though.


[23-Jun-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	They award 4.5-5k AIC. Seems like it could be decent since I just started


[23-Jun-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	look at how much fuel it'll take to get there and back though, and calculate the cost


[23-Jun-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	It’s _usually_ not worth the cost to do survey missions (rule of thumb, fuel costs about 15±1 AIC per unit), buuuuuuut I like to collect the ones without deadlines. I like to see them gather dust in idle.


[23-Jun-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	after some quick math, I'd make ~500 AIC from the best one


[23-Jun-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Do you get any special rights for exploring the planets?


[23-Jun-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	nope


[23-Jun-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Yeah, these missions just kind of suck


[23-Jun-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	when I was starting I focused on the ones that took something I produced. I set up camp on my starter planet and got some early money selling supplies that way so I minimized trips out


[23-Jun-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I didn't buy fuel for nearly 2 months as a result


[23-Jun-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	now I mostly just ignore the faction contracts


[23-Jun-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	I went and bought a rig to supply water to my carbon farm.


[23-Jun-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	I think if I buy another habitation and food processor, I should be relatively self sufficient


[23-Jun-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	or maybe another incinerator since carbon is really slow


[23-Jun-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you should look at what produces the most value for you. I like self sufficiency but if you can make more money producing C than you save by not buying supplies then there's little reason to produce them yourself

[23-Jun-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	yeah the price of it has risen quite a bit lately. It's one of my more profitable endeavors currently


[23-Jun-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Crazy that the stuff I scrape off my barbeque sells for more than my home grown beans, made with love


[23-Jun-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	well given that we use it to make the metal for your barbecue, I don't think it's too crazy


[23-Jun-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Making up numbers, but consider the question that it asks.  Is it better to use a limited resource (area) to have it so that you consume 100 credits per day (repairs) and produces no revenue, or to have the area be used for something that consumes 500 worth of materials but produces 1000 credits / day?

[24-Jun-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I assume you meant adding another permit...


[24-Jun-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	otherwise, expanding would be building more buildings, if that is your question, you need to check the materials needed for the buildings you want to... build.

[01-Jul-24 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Spermatozoon_Saloon you've missed the next sensation that is sweeping the nation. We at promitor no longer farm out beans, we fement them, into a succulent succor that lets us forget the tribulating ordeal of a days work. Get with the times, man!


[01-Jul-24 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The retail customer usually gets an individualized packet of stringy goo, that they swirly up and consume, either wholly, or crushed and dispensed in say a soup. It's a long-lost delicacy that was imported to South America, from the orient, when we were still on Earth.


[01-Jul-24 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But apparently some rambunctious kids have started reading our left-over history books, and have made it into an insatiable meme that is pouring-over our social media networks, back in Hortus space. :P


[01-Jul-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Dang kids and their new fangled fermented bean curd. Why, in my day we did all the fermenting and digesting in our own intestines! Whatever happened to "Beans beans, good for your heart! Beans beans, make you fart!"

**CheBuRek**:	Hi


[01-Jul-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	Where can I buy stuff for new base construction? It's my first day in the game


[01-Jul-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	CX AI1


[01-Jul-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	That's the closest commodity exchange


[01-Jul-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The materials should be in the inventory of both your ships already starting out


[01-Jul-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	I need a second base so I won't need to import materials from elsewhere. Fuel company on Harmonia as water planet and the closest to the sun planet isn't occupied and has He3 deposits


[01-Jul-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	I don't see much competition in this system in regards of my specialization so it should be easier to begin with


[01-Jul-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	Thank you


[01-Jul-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	You'd probably need to take out a sizable loan to fund the parts for and feed your two colonies. Second base isn't something that I think many people get straight off the bat


[01-Jul-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	I should probably begin with a small food supply segment to at least have some profit from the start


[01-Jul-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Also you said you're seeing He3 on Antares IVa??

[01-Jul-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Hernanduer**:	You'll probably lose more money trying to convert that than it's worth


[01-Jul-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you're better off buying fuel from the CX using resources you can make more efficiently


[01-Jul-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	:(


[01-Jul-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheBuRek**:	I guess it's better to oragnize full-cycle on the ZV-896 rather than bringing raw to Harmonia


[01-Jul-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Another question for the group. Why does my HQ have a 20% electronics efficiency gain and is it possible to change it? Is it based on the plot you purchase?


[01-Jul-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The HQ bonus is based on the faction where the HQ for your company is currently located in.


[01-Jul-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you establish a base in Hortus space, and move the HQ there (just the HQ), you'll get a food / agri bonus instead.

**RiseofFilth**:	Just wanted to say, Caskman has done a great job running Harmonia and has always been receptive and communicative when advice was needed. The POPI and COGCs are well looked after by him. He is an exemplary governor and he should absolutely be re-elected, and it makes me happy to see his lead. Hope to serve alongside him in Parliament. He has my vote.

**Milanin**:	If a newbie were to try being a merchant, what's the thing to most watch out for?


[08-Jul-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Contracts that cost more to fulfill than offer as a reward... and that the destination offers something you can pickup on a return trip, double the money.

**shagie**:	The NPC / faction contracts are things like the Antares Expedition Manager offers.


[16-Jul-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They come every day or so at the start and eventually slow down to every three days.


[16-Jul-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I always accept the delivery to CX and survey without a time limit.  You can get lucky with survey ones - even if they're not going to a place you go to often.  Get 2x or 3x of them and something that was unprofitable before for fuel can become profitable.


[16-Jul-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	Why: contract want me to provision 100 DW with deadline of 7 days. I can probably dont make it, so i want to extend my time by accepting this contract after i have that amount.


[17-Jul-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	There is a deadline to accept it


[17-Jul-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sky_Rey**:	They do, but many delivery contracts have no expiration once you accept it and pickup the cargo.


[17-Jul-24 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Open contracts expire after 48 hours.


[17-Jul-24 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Faction contracts will sit there for that long and block new contracts from coming (if they normally would come in less than that).

**Andy97**:	Starter ag planets like this typically seem to have low pio unemployment. The planet is in really good hands with caskman.


[23-Jul-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It's nice seeing people as new as you are already interested in government. I've found it to be a really entertaining aspect of the game.


[23-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And from a percentage standpoint that's "low", but 4.8% of the 226,943 pio is 10,893


[23-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	So it's actually a good bit of unemployed pops


[23-Jul-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'm always interested in contributing to the cooperative elements of games as i can


[23-Jul-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	when i can afford to i'd like to help finish off that art cafe


[23-Jul-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'll also be hiring some more pios once i have a buildup of carbon to sell as i'd like to build a second incinerator and maybe food production


[23-Jul-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Good deal!


[23-Jul-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Something to look into eventually when you've built up a bit is CoGC optimization


[23-Jul-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I don't know how much you've looked into all this yet, but Harmonia is an agriculture planet. The chamber of global commerce here is set to agriculture, and that provides a 25% bonus to all ag production.


[23-Jul-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Eventually you'll probably want to look at Norwick for food production and Nascent for carbon


[23-Jul-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Your second base will be a little while out though


[23-Jul-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i chose this as my starter planet as a carbon farmer


[23-Jul-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	making multiple bases sounds hard to manage with the fuel and time costs to move around planets


[23-Jul-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	how many of the resources do you get back if you demolish a building? I notice the 79% eff on carbon and i wouldn't mind just having another farm instead...


[23-Jul-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	This will do you good for a while producing carbon


[23-Jul-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Your efficiency will increase as you get more experts too


[23-Jul-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Have you played with prunplanner at all?


[23-Jul-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jul-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Very good resource


[23-Jul-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The amount of resources you get back if you demolish a building depends on the decay


[23-Jul-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	How long it's been since you've last repaired


[23-Jul-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Eventually it's going to be worth it to tear down the INCs and move them to a resource extraction planet


[23-Jul-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The 25% bonus on C production will blow the cost of any lost prefabs out of the water


[23-Jul-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i couldn't figure out how to make prunplanner work xD


[23-Jul-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Ahhh


[23-Jul-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	it wanted to import from fio which then requires making a whole different account and aaaah


[23-Jul-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Were you able to find Harmonia on there?


[23-Jul-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	yeah


[23-Jul-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh, I see


[23-Jul-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I just punch everything manually into prunplanner


[23-Jul-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	so knock down the incinerator when i can afford to build another farm. gotcha


[23-Jul-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Not necessarily

[23-Jul-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Like I was saying, you can build up the carbon operation here until you have the resources to build a second base for the INCs


[23-Jul-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Prunplanner will help you balance the FRM:INC ratio


[23-Jul-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I started off with FRM and FP on Promitor until I built a base on Avalon


[23-Jul-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And then I moved my FPs over to Avalon


[23-Jul-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	oh so that means the rig pumping water for the farms is also running at 79%. huh.


[23-Jul-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	xD the notification that one of my rig's cycles finished 5 seconds after that post startled me lol


[23-Jul-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You get used to the ding


[23-Jul-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	After a while you'll wind up turning off the production notifications


[23-Jul-24 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	okay so there's also medium and high end agricultural stations i could set up to grow more expensive products later on


[24-Jul-24 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'm amused at Paris's use of local market to just buy all their incinerator's needs instead of going shopping off-planet

**Arctarus**:	I'm probably going to pick up a month of pro soon. Is there anything in specific I should focus on after carbon generation?


[02-Aug-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	A month of pro?


[02-Aug-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can only do HQ upgrades while pro. It's a good thing to plan ahead for that window of opportunity, and it opens up additional process efficiencies, if you usually do the same thing.


[02-Aug-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	As for specifics in what you do afterwards? It's all up to you. You can do anything you want, in this game.


[02-Aug-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	-- HQ upgrades, beyond lv 5 --


[02-Aug-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	I completely forgot about base upgrades. Probably because it was pro locked. That'd definitely be something good to get


[02-Aug-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	And it also opens up the local market. I can work on that too.


[02-Aug-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	I would suggest taking a shit lord of loans and really expanding fast, particularly if you might not be pro again


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	^ also doable --- ship upgrades are also a thing, during your pro period.


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you can get all the mats you need for upgrades, you can run that during your month, and get the worries over.


[02-Aug-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Afterwards, your BASIC license experience would probably be better, not only with better/more stuff, but also with the BASIC perks now forever unlocked to you, provided that you don't forget about this game.


[02-Aug-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Where would I get/repay loans?


[02-Aug-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	You ask around for loans, loads of people offer them


[02-Aug-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	then you calculate what bases are efficient enough to pay back the cost


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	Cool


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	im at 20 bases in 45 days, you can do a lot in 1 month of pro


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	in general you can get 2-3 week ROI and 6-8 week loans, that plenty of time to repay


[02-Aug-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arctarus**:	I guess with pro and an upgraded base my production would jump up by a ton

[07-Aug-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azean**:	Heya, you can not increase the max experts number. You can not have more than 6 active experts on one planet and you can not have more than 5 active experts in a category. There is no way to increase those limits. The amount of experts themselves slowly rises if you have active production for their category.


[07-Aug-24 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**KittensAttack**:	Is pop immigration/emigration affected only by happiness, or does unemployment play a factor? If I build IVF, will Technicians immigrate to fill the slots as necessary? And if they're unhappy enough, will they ever leave my base or do they stay forever once recruited?


[11-Aug-24 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	They stay forever, unless the happiness bar is significantly down, I think, and even that I'm not sure about. A governor might be better to ask, but I got the impression that happiness controls population immigration and (unemployment) retention, but doesn't really affect the employee retention.

**sztypettto**:	The guvnur only cares about the immigrants who give him a Hawk Tuah and work for free, take care of pregnancies themselves, and die in a ditch so the expenses dont become a liability for the state. That's why the quality of life is being reduced to control work visas.

[12-Aug-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	The success rate of capitalism is great for the top 10%. It's good for the following 20%. It's a living for the 25-70 percentile. It's shit for the rest.

**Geraldivar**:	So... you know, silver linings.


[12-Aug-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Per @Geraldivar, they're on the spot. Unless you were born in a position, to benefit directly, from the economic/political outcomes of a given system of distribution (capitalism/communism), you're essentially stuck in the aggregate majority of things, which will differ based on your political priorites, that you see in your area/country.


[12-Aug-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can argue for either, but there's inherent priorities that either system adopts as their bottom line. Do your reasearch, and maybe you'll find out that the nuances of either outcome, aren't so aligned with the propaganda that you get from your media? But the #new-world-communism isn't what was seen in the #old-world-communism. You have two, very different things, with very different goals there.

**sztypettto**:	You did not answer the success rate of Capitalism and instead deflected to propaganda numbers from your daddies. Every economic system gets rid of defective produce. Capitalism does it through homelessness, poverty, prison cells, driving people crazy to become active shooters, overdose etc. Socialism, Communism does it by sending people to re-education or shutting off the lights after a loud bang behind you.


[12-Aug-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	I guarantee that you will not answer the success rate of Capitalism because you know too well the answer yourself but you're a coward, and a hypocrite to admit the answer.


[12-Aug-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	And no, Communism does not run out of other people's money. That's Capitalism, which explains why the US is over 35 trillion in debt, and every capitalist monopoly, duopoly inflates to such a stellar market value like a bubble that when it bursts, it's hypocritically called market correction.


[12-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Big banks, big corporations, politicians and just about everything runs out of money, and fall in massive debt despite accumulating massive capital which is called economic stress


[12-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'm just looking to be a single-base casual capitalist, i'm not looking to mess with advanced products


[17-Aug-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	best option for single basing it is to process your AG products into RATs or Carbon


[17-Aug-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'm doing some carbon and the excess for sale


[17-Aug-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	otherwise the market can be very fickle for raw products like BEA and GRN


[17-Aug-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i grew enough GRN to burn for awhile and am just growing BEA to sell while the incinerator burns out my supply


[17-Aug-24 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	I'm pretty happy with the profit I'm getting from growing HER and the supplies for RATs, then making and selling FIM (and the excess RATs).


[17-Aug-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Only 2 farms and 2 FPs right now, hoping to expand to a third FP to make more DW and COF on the side.


[17-Aug-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I'm expanding my RAT production here in the next month or so, but over in SE-110


[17-Aug-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i don't have any plans to expand


[17-Aug-24 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you did say single planet, so I kinda figured


[17-Aug-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i mean like, it's really awkward just how much the ag program bonus helps, makes me want to even get out of carbon


[17-Aug-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	you could always get the C off to another planet and go all agri


[17-Aug-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	nah i don't want to set up a second base


[17-Aug-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	thats long term the best way anyways to ensure efficiendy


[17-Aug-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	How come? just curious


[17-Aug-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i want this game to be super casual check in while my guild's regrouping between wipes tier for me


[17-Aug-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	got it


[17-Aug-24 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Agriculture != (does not equal) Resouce Extraction (INC | C industry).


[17-Aug-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People make INC inputs on one planet, ship them off to the other planet, and burn them.


[17-Aug-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	yeah which is why i'm considering eliminating my C burning and just focusing on 4-5x ag lines


[17-Aug-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	QJ-149c is the premier hub for C-processing around ZV-896b. You'll be sharing it with AL processors, among other people.


[17-Aug-24 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The shipping requirements are kinda dicey, if you go and buildup your operational scale, though.


[17-Aug-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	PRO licensees can do that, but you, as a TRIAL user, would want to focus on minimizing your shipping requirements.


[17-Aug-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	When you're stuck with x2 500t/m3 FTL ships, you can only do, so much!


[17-Aug-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	yah i can't afford any more expenses anyway lol, but at the same time if i do a small op now i can set myself up for a bigger op if i ever decide to invest more time later


[17-Aug-24 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i also made an early mistake in trying trading without looking at the volume of the item i wanted to trade. it hasn't sold in two weeks xD haven't needed the ship so i just left it

**saletroo**:	Hello comrades o7


[18-Aug-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	I have a question. What would happend if i dont complete game contract?


[18-Aug-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	I have a delivery contract from game, for some silly money. Ive accepted thinking that the destination is to EX


[18-Aug-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	but after arriving to EX, the real destination is somere else, and the money i earn dont cover my fuel costs, and i dont want to fly there


[18-Aug-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	What would happend if deadline reaches 0 and i fail to complete the contract? Some money fee? I lose some fraction reputation?


[18-Aug-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	i have some time left so i have some ground to fix this, but i really dont want spend 4k fuel for 1k money


[18-Aug-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	thanks in advance o7


[18-Aug-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You lose faction reputation, and if you picked up the shipment, it would unwrap to whatever it is. Almost by guarantee less worth than the shipping contract.


[18-Aug-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	For these shipping contracts it always pays (in this case literally ;) ) to check who and where. "Provision" means whoever is in that row supplies stuff, and "partner" means the other side of the contract.


[18-Aug-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	So for instance if the contract says something like "provision 100 units of RAT at Harmonia" and the party column lists is empty it means you are the one providing the 100 units.


[18-Aug-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	In contrast if it says "provisioning shipment @ Harmonia" it means the partner provides a shipment at that location, you pick it up there, deliver it to wherever it says in the contract (the CX for instance), and then you also need to hit FULFIL on the contract.


[18-Aug-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You don't need to have storage or a warehouse at the delivery location, the partner takes care of that.

[19-Aug-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Tranderas, your a TRIAL licensee -- you will get nothing for helping out, not that we won't give you anything, it's just that you won't be able to accept any contracts from the GOV, or private parties.


[19-Aug-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	so you couldn't give me anything anyway, works out perfectly

**Roh**:	XD


[19-Aug-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	If so 2) Up to you entirely


[19-Aug-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EWA_Spaceways**:	I used to play a less complex game about airlines like this. But there were so many players it was so hard to win lol.


[19-Aug-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The game's basically Eve Online, without Jita and ganks, at least for now.


[19-Aug-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EWA_Spaceways**:	SO ya if I can figure it out probably


[19-Aug-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i started playing this cause i was tired of getting ganked at grim hex tbh


[19-Aug-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EWA_Spaceways**:	I started with the like water, farmstead, food processor start


[19-Aug-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i started with carbon production but thinking of moving to food processing lol


[19-Aug-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EWA_Spaceways**:	I tried to do manufacturing first but realized it was probably not a good one to start with. Food seemed easier


[20-Aug-24 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Ganking still happens. Just not with warp disruptors, webifiers, jammers and pew pew that zaps you before you can blink your eyes. The Ganking mobs still exist. They can be identified by their green coloured names in the chat, and multiple governor titles. And Jita is Moria.

[20-Aug-24 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Technically stealing profit margins explicitly isn't an issue. It's conning people into believing they have a chance at the market, when in reality the markets are rigged, manipulated, and colluded by cartels who masquerade as ordinary players

**sztypettto**:	But the cartels don't like it so the lamest thing they do is just engage in denial and ridicule


[20-Aug-24 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Take a look at who you're selling to, and who you are buying from. New players are very less likely to buy things at high prices. Cartels push up prices of buy and sell so the fresh meat is forced to buy at a higher price


[20-Aug-24 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Then as soon as they want to buy something, they'll crash the prices


[20-Aug-24 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Whatever you sell to them, they'll relist it for a higher price back on the market.

**sztypettto**:	@KittensAttack, one way to measure market activity is to follow the chart. The CX does not represent the entirety of any commodity's market activity. Plenty of insider trading and private contracts happen. If you're listing your FIM, check with listed buyers and chat with people buying FIM to understand their buying needs. The market works based on market forces. Of course the element that books leave out is corruption, collusion, manipulation, scams, frauds etc. Fortunately scams and fraud have been minimised greatly in PU. But the other elements remain.


[21-Aug-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Diversify what you can sell


[21-Aug-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	Don't stick with one commodity

**sztypettto**:	A lot of people make money not from commodities but by hauling cargo for others, lending money, becoming the merchant of venice, private contracts, renting out land, collecting taxes, and just like real life, cash handouts to win favours.

**sztypettto**:	This is all regarding PU

**sztypettto**:	If you're still going to cry and aren't cut out for any of this. Just embrace it. In a cut-throat competitive world, not everyone is equal. Some are better than others. Some were earlier than others. Some were luckier than others. And some bought their way than others.

**vidilet**:	Turns out, I forgot to bring a couple of basic bulkheads to build a food processor, so no processed food till the next truck arrives. It might be a scam to force me to buy a license for ordering space construction materials on local market...

**EnemyCube**:	I got a good chuckle at the comment about FIM crashing again. from my perspective it's still crashed; I used to buy DDT for 1700 and sell FIM for 2000+ earlier this year

[23-Aug-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KZ_Kawasaki**:	My general math says Lux goods will make things faster, but only by making our own COF here does it become cheaper.


[23-Aug-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	yeah, generally speaking, the lux goods will cost you more upfront, but lower your ROI as well. so you spend more money, but make more money in return. I'd say it's almost always worth it, but it depends on how much money you have upfront :D


[23-Aug-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	(you can trust me to be unbiased because I'm a COF supplier :P  )


[23-Aug-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Tranderas**:	that said my RAT lines are up and running now so here's hoping for some good future business


[23-Aug-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	does demolishing a building return any of the resources used to build it?


[23-Aug-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	some

**sztypettto**:	Click on the buildings button of your base


[23-Aug-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	it lists the reclaimable materials for demolishing specific buildings


[23-Aug-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	My spreadsheet says that with making my own COF I'm probably making a little money if it's only going towards very profitable production lines.


[23-Aug-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	However, I'm perfectly okay with still losing some money because I'm impatient and finishing things faster feels nice.


[23-Aug-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	really?


[23-Aug-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	so it looks like if i were to, say, harvest water on harmonia


[23-Aug-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	it looks like COF alone would lose a little


[23-Aug-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	PWO would gain me a little


[23-Aug-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	but COF + PWO would gain me morethan just PWO


[23-Aug-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	looks like they get a little boost from having both lux filled out


[23-Aug-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	now if i were an idiot and collected O from harmonia


[23-Aug-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	then COF loses out both ways :thinking:


[23-Aug-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	back up to water harvesting though, if i start adding experts, COF solo also adds a little profit


[23-Aug-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	at 2 experts, COF at its current market price is a tiny gain-maybe not after shipping


[23-Aug-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	...would you consider water harvesting on harmonia to be a 'very profitable production'?


[23-Aug-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	My calculations said I would be losing money on my rig, but I should probably recheck it.


[23-Aug-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	So, based on my observations, supplying everything to PIO gives about a 15% increase in efficiency over everything except COF.


[23-Aug-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	At an opportunity cost of ~650 per unit, and 1 unit per 100 per day, that means that you need to increase your profit/day by at least 650 per 100 PIO for it to be worth it.


[23-Aug-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
***nincool** joined.*


[23-Aug-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	So it would need a base daily revenue (I was using profit here before - that was probably screwing up my calculations!) of about 4300 per 100 PIO to have a profit from applying COF (and keep in mind that if you make your own COF, your COF is going towards that as well).


[23-Aug-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	My rig replaces about 800 in H2O purchases every day with COF applied, and has 10 PIO. So actually that replaces 8000 per 100 PIO, so it is worth it.


[23-Aug-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	hold up


[23-Aug-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	COF is only .5 per 100


[23-Aug-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Oh right


[23-Aug-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	It says that in my spreadsheet I was just too lazy to look at it lmao


[23-Aug-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Wait RIG also has 30 worker I looked at the wrong row


[23-Aug-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	have any experts?


[23-Aug-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	So the threshold is more like 2150/100 PIO/day, and my RIG at 98% (with COF and 1 expert) offsets 2605 of purchases every day.


[23-Aug-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Which means I think the additional productivity from COF is ~340/day, just barely making up for the ~325/day being spent.


[23-Aug-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	(Though that uses a cost of 650 per COF, which is not exactly up-to-date)


[23-Aug-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	...any experts in that calc?


[23-Aug-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Yes, one resource extraction expert.


[23-Aug-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	also are you looking at COF alone or COF + PWO


[23-Aug-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	because the two combined is worth more than each individually


[23-Aug-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Just the effect of COF. I do have PWO supplied.


[23-Aug-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	PWO on its own is already pretty clearly worth it I think, so this just everything vs. everything but COF.


[23-Aug-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	20.56% efficiency with both, 7.23% with just PWO, 12.23% with just COF


[23-Aug-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	best thing I ever did was start making both of those, so I don't even factor it in


[23-Aug-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Yes but then you have to consider how much it eats into your profits when considering whether making those is better than an alternative investment!


[23-Aug-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	Please someone free me from the spreadsheet hell of my own making


[23-Aug-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I try not to get that far into it; I just move resources around and try to find decently-optimal setups


[23-Aug-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	but also I have a corp mate who actually does the COF brewing - I just provide the CAF


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KittensAttack**:	I like spreadsheets and optimisation so I do it for fun, but sometimes I get in way too deep and realise why accounting exists as a career and why they get paid pretty well.


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm all about optimization and automation. but this is a game to me


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	so I draw the line at a certain point


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I make plenty of money


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	enough to buy ships when I need them, etc


[23-Aug-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	sure kitten. at current AI1 ask prices, if you use both PWO and COF you see a minor uptick compaired to PWO alone


[23-Aug-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobzor**:	i put an ad buying some water on local market if anyone has some lying around


[23-Aug-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	about a 1.19% uplift


[23-Aug-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	if i wasn't f2p i would bobz, sorry mate


[23-Aug-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobzor**:	i saw thanks will need this much every 10 days :)


[23-Aug-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	you can extract your own H2O on harmonia by building rigs. or you can buy it cheap at the community exchange on Antares I.


[23-Aug-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobzor**:	anyone making CAF , HER or MTP ?


[23-Aug-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobzor**:	if i can save on fuel why wouldnt i buy locally :)


[23-Aug-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	i produce lots of water on a different planet. i can regularly sell you some if you post on the local market.


[23-Aug-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	CAF, HER and MTP are intermediate steps for more expensive products. they are very difficult to buy since they are all directly used for hte next production step. if you are lucky you can buy some surplus production.


[23-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	pretty soon I'll have my third visit to Harmonia with my own ships. it feels so odd that I've been here for a few months and have so few visits

**Onoya**:	Hello, i'm a new player! for peoples that want to sell basic rations and drinking water, i've put some offer on the local market. It's lower prize than the current offers in Antares I market, but higher offer, and you don't have to travel

**PumpAndDump**:	I seem to have made a poor mans error. I have 2AIC in my account and cannot afford production costs for anything. I have 1k CIS/ICA/NCC. Is there any way to generate income without having to do a station run?


[28-Aug-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	So did I just stumble on the answer typing this out? Can I just foreign exhange my way out?


[28-Aug-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	@PumpAndDump - if you have a pro license, you could exchange those currencies for sweet sweet AIC


[28-Aug-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	If you don't have pro, you could also sell the fuel in one of your ships to make some quick cash


[28-Aug-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	You should also get some faction contracts starting out that will pay you some cash. But if all else fails, you can COLIQ and start over - most people do that once or twice

[29-Aug-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	True, but if you don’t have PRO, can’t afford your production fees, and don’t want to COLIQ, then I can’t think of any other option :/


[29-Aug-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Aug-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	oops. I will recover from this financial catostrophe. I literally have 0 aic, low fuel on ships but can make it to the exhcnage. I have one ship headed to scan a planet worth 3k so that would tide me over until I can sell my wares. I guess I won't try and spend all my money again


[29-Aug-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	planet scan missions are... usually not worth the fuel cost


[29-Aug-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	that is likely true. But when I got 0 AIC, I would scrape shite off your spaceship for pennies

[31-Aug-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	any general guidelines to go by for newbies? I have 3x Farmstead, 2x food processors, 2x rigs. I am wondering if for a first planet i should just maximise building of these 3 and then use it to move to the next base with a different goal of building or do people generally have a mix of tier 2+ items on their inital base?


[31-Aug-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	and I realise I should get the spreadsheet out and go the math, which I will, but generally


[31-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	start selling carbon before you create another base. Get yourself a x4 farmstead (3 for rations, 1 for HCP), and 1x Incierator. Its better to get your coins from carbon, than from game contracts


[31-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	in my main base i have 5x farmstead (GRN, HCP, MAI, BEA, NUT) for rations and carbon, 2x Food Processors (DW, RAT) 2x Inciinerators (C) and x5 Rigs (H2o)


[31-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	To buy parts I have to fly my ship to antares 1?


[31-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	yes - slide those fuel sliders to lowest, save money for fuel


[31-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	dont fly empty, always send ship with something to sell, when you send them for something to buy


[31-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	I dont have anything to sell atm, just started


[31-Aug-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	Maybe some RAT and DW?


[31-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	if you can spare of course. You have enought to survive at least 1 week without production?


[31-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	wdym 1 week without production?


[31-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kahetabi**:	exactly 7.3 days


[31-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	for DW and RAT?


[31-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	yup


[31-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	but i can produce them for myself anyway


[31-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	great, so you can survive one week before your workforce stop producing


[31-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	you can sell extra for start


[31-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	later in game, create some saving for 1 month


[31-Aug-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	sounds fine


[31-Aug-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PumpAndDump**:	Thanks @Saleetroo. I have mostly been making cash with contracts so far but its capitalism sim and i am rolling the snowball so it will pick up. I used to play Eve Online and was making killer money trading markets for years so its somewhat nostalgic


[31-Aug-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	1 month storage of consumables is like a Holy Crap amount. How about having 2 days worth of consumables, have the ship constantly running two ways, and use that money to build a giant base instead


[31-Aug-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	I dread to count what's 30 days of coffee cost


[31-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	coffee is not essential for production, so i dont count it as savings


[31-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	but youre right, 1 month of coffee is to much


[31-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	selling carbon, i always calculate my expenses to have for at least 1 week


[31-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	same with PWO


[31-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	PWO?

**saletroo**:	that makes your people more happy and more productive


[31-Aug-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	its listed on Workforce as non-essential


[31-Aug-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	It's presented like a penalty to productions. So you will need both COF and PWO to have pioneers productivity at 100%, but the difference is, without essensials, the production will stop.


[31-Aug-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	correct


[31-Aug-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	without COF and PWO, base production drops to like 78%, 82%? i dont remember now


[31-Aug-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	79.4


[31-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Also, calculating if the Coffee suplies are worth it, costed me like 8 hours of excel, and I still don't have a good formula to recalculating it, only some approximations and guidelines


[31-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	8 hours of excel, wow


[31-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	I'll just wing it


[31-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	I'm a simple man! I put money in, I want more money out.


[31-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	oh, is that nessesary? Round up production to 1 day of one commodity. If you can produce more RAT and DW in one day than you consume, you good to go


[31-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	+


[31-Aug-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	same with farmstead. 12 MAI is 1 day, 12 BEA is 1 day, 12 NUT is 1 day. Having 3 Farmstead, you can produce 12x10 RAT


[31-Aug-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	*produce materials for 120 RAT per day


[31-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**saletroo**:	your results may vary, you have to accomidate the base experts as well


[31-Aug-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	great tips by saletroo for starting out. later in the game you can move some of your production to other planets so that you have more space for farms here.


[31-Aug-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	planet norwick in the YK-649 system is great for food production. planet ice station alpha in the thalassa system (SE-110) has lots of water.

**PumpAndDump**:	Thanks Zillatron. Kinda what I was guessing. How about the corporate side of things? Is there any real benefit for a free account person to join someones corp?


[04-Sep-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	Really up to you, Given you've only just started I'd say no. There are some production benifits if they have a completed HQ but it's tied to what the CoGC of the planet it's built on.


[04-Sep-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	I'm sure other more experinced CEOs will have better tips but at this stage building out your first base and getting some stable income is a good goal :)

**Roh**:	Players get co-linear benefits, within a CORP, provided such corporation, has an operational Corporare headquarters, that'll benefit all members, a 10% production bonus, across all industries (1/2 of a COGC, which is otherwise industry specific).


[05-Sep-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of course, there is a division between pro classifications. @PumpAndDump never bought even just 1 month of pro, under their account, so they will forever be a TRIAL licensee, unable to accept/issue LM conts, unable to upgrade their ships, and unable to upgrade their HQ levels.


[05-Sep-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Geraldivar**:	Understandable. As long as your setup requires only logging in once a day or less to queue in new production orders, you're fine for a long while. You *might* want to put some money aside for a WCB upgrade to your ships, which would increase the cargo capacity to 3000t/1000m3, but getting such at market price is… somewhat expensive. Way cheaper than a new ship though.

**Geraldivar**:	There are people who loan money for interest, or the ANT development initiative grants money, as long as you settle in ANT space.


[12-Sep-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	So if you're new(ish) and want to build a base, they incentivise you to settle in ANT space.


[12-Sep-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Despite common perception, they do not require beans for that.


[12-Sep-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Im new and settled in ANT (Griffonstone/Norwick)... 1 mil would help a lot hehe but ... its preferable if this goes to others more in need than me ;)

**Tranderas**:	I couldn't in good conscience take it considering i'm dedicated to a casual "log in twice a day to maintain one base" playstyle :)


[12-Sep-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	@Tranderas only a single base is still very early game, how much playtime you have has no bearing on how "developed" you are. only your material conditions matter


[12-Sep-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	so there's no reason you're not eligible. you'd be a perfect candidate, even.


[12-Sep-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	true


[12-Sep-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i don't really plan to move beyond a single base to keep this game as a casual side thing between raid bosses :)


[12-Sep-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Tranderas yes, keep it super casual, watch casually your empire grow and thrive! produce goods, supply our universe, thank you. o7


[12-Sep-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Onoya - the goverment can not buy material on the CX - only companys can do. So the goverment gives money to companys (governor is a company) to buy materials to maintain and develop the planet


[17-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	it has become tradition that the governor does all the heavy lifting like buying COGC Materials and POPI upkeep materials.


[17-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so the goverment has to pay him that expense back


[17-Sep-24 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Sep-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	But you can guesstimate that. We've got 460 employed techs, that's 46 ORCs or 7 IVPs. How many orders per day can that be? (I ain't doing that xD)


[19-Sep-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Anyway yeah, a 30 AIC tax on techs is just silly :D All I'm saying is that you can be pretty much sure that you'll need another motion in a week to bump the lower tiers.

**Onoya**:	Hey, if anyone is selling RAT, DW or OVE, i've just put an order at the local market


[20-Sep-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Onoya**:	150 RAT and DW, and 50 OVE, at a prize per unit of 90 for DW, 146,67 for RAT and 138 for OVE, so better prize to sell than in the CX at antares 1

[20-Sep-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	should ask the ANT development group for some goverment bailouts


[20-Sep-24 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	RAT prices dropped a bit, but OVE prices are raising for over a month now


[20-Sep-24 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I just cashed all out the buy orders down to 90/u


[20-Sep-24 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	i got 30k or so OVE lying around, so if anyone wants to request some from me on Ant for 90/u, you are welcome to do so


[20-Sep-24 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but ive also pushed the sell price down to 115, but ill leave it at that to disuade market manipulations

[22-Sep-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	it's only once every what, 3 days? and since i can't take player contracts anyway it's not like they're taking up space or anything

[22-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	they're a nice little extra 4k when i need to go to cx anyway


[22-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	they get super weird later. Starts asking you to run out to barren planets in the back end of nowhere, or for materials you have no way of even producing


[22-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	if it was still easy like it started out, I'd still have them on


[22-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**vidilet**:	I need to find reasonable measure to sort liquid and not liquid materials on exchange. Determine the sellables. And then exclude those who require non-buyable components. And with that list estimate forecasted profitability. PrunPlanner does not yet help

[23-Sep-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**vidilet**:	i just want think, I can dump on exchange in exchange for money


[23-Sep-24 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	and without that, formulas try to convince me, it's a good idea to produce Large FTL Emitters


[23-Sep-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I mean it is, but only if you're subcontracting for @RiseofFilth or @Evov


[24-Sep-24 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tranderas**:	i'm looking some of you up and you have way more bases than i could even imagine trying to run given the amount of time i want to give this game lol


[24-Sep-24 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	The key to that is having bases set up in a production line, such that a single ship can service multiple bases (restock at CX, pick up produce at restock base A, deliver produce from A at B and pick up and restock B, deliver produce B at CX and restock), or having buffers large enough that the bases need to be serviced on the order of fortnights.


[24-Sep-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	The only things that take me a lot of time in this game is socializing and scheming


[24-Sep-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's fairly easy if you have the tools to do so (no, prunplanner will not help you in that regard).

[26-Sep-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I could pick the fifth and wait til last minute to pick it up and deliver without breaching, but I think that's a bit of a dickish move. I wish we could edit the contracts to change the deadline for pick up and delivery separately.


[26-Sep-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	but I can guarantee the first 4 within actual 3 days


[26-Sep-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Also, I forgot to load Nitrogen cargo, so no fertilizer production yet.


[26-Sep-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@vidilet first, congratulations on your investment!


[26-Sep-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	there are some tools that can help with your expansion plans, namely PrunPlanner


[26-Sep-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	There's a planet search there, where you can select the COGC (Chemistry) and setup your farm system in the search, then you will see a list of planets by distance of your farm. That may help you in your future expansions :), it helps me a lot.


[26-Sep-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Just checked, the planet you chose is close to Harmonia, 5 jumps. Nice :)


[26-Sep-24 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Thank you for encouragement. I think i should try to run production to full ship load - that would minimize fuel expenses. Maybe

[27-Sep-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	how are prices regulated, what determines em


[28-Sep-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	those are the green rouge and..


[28-Sep-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	dark blue?


[28-Sep-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	im yellow i guess


[28-Sep-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	yellow is your base, blue is other players


[28-Sep-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	whats dark blue, it doesnt open a ... buffer


[28-Sep-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	wait, am i renting space in the warehouse


[28-Sep-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	not unless you've gone out of your way to do that


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	oh i see


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	warehouses are supplementary storage, your base starts with 1500t/m3 just for existing


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	cubic meter tonnes?


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	just a short hand way of saying it holds up to 1500t or 1500m3


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	or, trillion cubic meters


[28-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ohh


[28-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	okay gotcha


[28-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	mass vs volume, etc


[28-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	yeah so equivalent weight/volume of water cm3


[28-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	lol yeah, H2O.AI1 is definitely right in that mass/volume distribution


[28-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	okay so production lines, is a new order what im supposed to do?


[28-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	yes, you'll want to follow the tutorial pretty closely. It should have you start a job either at the FRM you built or the RIG you built


[28-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I didn't start provisioner so I'm not quite sure about the order of it there


[28-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	funny, water is traded in a 5th of a tonne?


[28-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	the metal-plastic water containers, unless its something else in em


[28-Sep-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	this game has some weird logic to it. Helps to remember it's a game


[28-Sep-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	yeah, it caught me off guard ha


[28-Sep-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I think it's just a way of keeping some other recipes in check. If some things that take water took a full tonne shipping would be even more of a nightmare


[28-Sep-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	mm yeah gotcha


[28-Sep-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	allright ill throw some stuff at the wall and see what sticks, cya later bud


[28-Sep-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	thanks for the help/chat


[28-Sep-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	no problem!


[28-Sep-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	there's no hospital on the planet


[28-Sep-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	not good lmao


[28-Sep-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	but we do have 7 Infirmaries, so we'll be fine


[28-Sep-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	yeah, no books though


[28-Sep-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Santa614**:	hi jim


[28-Sep-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	yes, once you can supply your base with COF.AI1 and PWO.AI1 , your efficiency will be better


[28-Sep-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I recommend starting with PWO, it's cheaper and is consumed more slowly


[28-Sep-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	do i need to buy it at the uh


[28-Sep-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	capital system?


[28-Sep-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	the local market doesnt seem to have uh


[28-Sep-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	anything


[28-Sep-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	the CX? Yes, you will need to go there to purchase it. You should wait until you have some RAT to sell first though


[28-Sep-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Local Markets tend to be highly specific to the planet. Almost none of them are properly stocked with the essentials you'd need to run a base


[28-Sep-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	but you can buy water on the LM here most days


[28-Sep-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	how do i see or calculate if a trip there is profitable


[28-Sep-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	like for example to see if selling water there is profitable


[28-Sep-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you can plan a route for your ship to fly to the CX and it will show you how much fuel it will consume. Look up the fuel prices to see how much a trip there will cost, then double it to get the full transit costs


[28-Sep-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	also im thinking about making coffee myself, but im looking at this other planet, in system it has the limestone id need


[28-Sep-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	but i dont know how much the temp and pressure affect production


[28-Sep-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	if the revenue you generate is significantly better than the fuel cost, it's worth a trip


[28-Sep-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	i hover over the bars but it doesnt tell me anything


[28-Sep-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	temp and pressure negatively affect build cost. Each bar is assocated with two additional building materials needed to compensate


[28-Sep-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	just build cost?


[28-Sep-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	a red bar to the left on the temperature bar shows a need for INS, to the right it shows a need for HSE


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	cause if its just up front build cost its fine


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	build and maintenance costs, sorry


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ah


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	gotta look to see if i can find maintenance costs then


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	... do you want coffee? lmao


[28-Sep-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you are 60 days away from having to really learn about this, but all production buildings need to repaired or they start to lose efficiency


[28-Sep-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	mm okay


[28-Sep-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	is it like a unit of crafting materials per day or is it very very slow


[28-Sep-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	is it negiglible or is it.. heavy


[28-Sep-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	very very slow. It takes 60% to show any noticeable decline


[28-Sep-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	but it does get pretty bad past that point


[28-Sep-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I'm sorry, it takes 60 days for there to be enough damage to be noticeable


[28-Sep-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ah


[28-Sep-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I spaced and threw a % in there randomly


[28-Sep-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	thanks again


[28-Sep-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	no problem


[28-Sep-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	i have 80 unused workers, how do i eh


[28-Sep-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	yknow


[28-Sep-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	"im afraid i cant do that, dave"


[28-Sep-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	wait, im not paying them?


[28-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you pay them in RAT, DW, OVE,COF and PWO


[28-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	so you literally clothe them and feed them


[28-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	don't think about that part too hard


[28-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	oh boy, that got dark quick


[28-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	work to live


[28-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	not even coffee


[28-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	funny


[28-Sep-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	oh, fuel costs dont change based on cargo load?


[28-Sep-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	mhm coffe is worth much more to sell


[28-Sep-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	they do change, but only STL and not as much as you'd expect


[28-Sep-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you can mess around with that a bit through the BLU buffer, but that exposes you to a lot more advanced things too


[28-Sep-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	blu buffer?


[28-Sep-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ohh


[28-Sep-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	i see

[28-Sep-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	What's up?


[28-Sep-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	are you able to own multiple.. plots? on a planet


[28-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you can multi-permit a planet, but you cannot have a second base


[28-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	adding more permits to a base (up to 3) has diminishing returns. The first permit gives you 500 area to work with, #2 and #3 only give 250 area each


[28-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	multi permit?


[28-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ah


[28-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	hm


[28-Sep-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	use BS to pull up the Base buffer


[28-Sep-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	also whats the apex lisence cost, and where can i find the listing


[28-Sep-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you will have an option to "add" a permit to your current base. Doing so will increase its area by 250, brining it to 750


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	PRO licenses cost 8 Euro a month. Your account reverts to Basic after, keeping a lot of PRO's advantages


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	hmm


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	but I would suggest giving it a week or two before you buy


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	yeah i wasnt gonna buy, just wanted to know what i was gettin into


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	if nothing else to make sure you can make good use of a month of PRO


[28-Sep-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	okay cool


[28-Sep-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	im a budget guy, currently still saving up for factorio space age dlc


[28-Sep-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	or rather, trying not to spend it all on steel stock beforehand


[28-Sep-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	hands are itching to weld haha


[28-Sep-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	oh my base is capped at 2 permits?


[28-Sep-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	ahh upgrade hq, i see nvm


[28-Sep-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	do the production line building build costs also increase with the gravity and atmo hazards?


[28-Sep-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	yes, everythin you build on a planet will need the additional building materials


[28-Sep-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Gravity is the worst, low grav requires MGC, high grav requires BL


[28-Sep-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Atmo is cheap on the low pressure side, it just needs SEA. High Atmo requires TSH though, which is not cheap


[28-Sep-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	how do you see the materials needed without the base there built, wouldnt wanna do a double trip


[28-Sep-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Santa614**:	or get too many


[28-Sep-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	honestly? either napkin math or just use PRUN planner


[28-Sep-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	or build your own spreadsheet if that's more your style


[28-Sep-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sztypettto**:	If you're voting for caskman or believing in those recommending you to vote for him, you're being fooled just like real life voting for Zelensky.

[05-Oct-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	It’s like in the phrase "closing a deal". It means both partners agree / come to a close on the conditions and sign it.

[06-Oct-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-24 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Was just saying that if were to you get yourself a RIG base, it'd go a long way


[16-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	A full 500 area permit of FRMs here only burns about 220 water a day. A full starter ship will give you enough water to run a full base for 22 days.


[16-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	You must have your water bases triple permitted?


[16-Oct-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	because that is a LOT of water


[16-Oct-24 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	na, all single bases.


[16-Oct-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Got no spare H2O to put on the CX to sell at these spectacular prices, however; never have to buy any either.  It's a fairly equal balance.

**Blanko1230**:	I want to get into CAF but I feel it's wasted on this planet because of Fertility. Are there any HYF planets people use nearby?


[20-Oct-24 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blanko1230**:	nvm, I found Life. It seems perfect


[20-Oct-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	I thought fertility doesn't apply to them


[20-Oct-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	@Kahetabi you’re right - I think what they meant was that it would be a waste putting HYF on a fertile planet when you could have FRM instead


[20-Oct-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kahetabi**:	I somehow missed that he said he's looking for HYF planet

[27-Oct-24 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But, I think I can do much better than some base imitation @Zipatsu... I've intentionally included some potent quips in the original.. Perhaps making it a bit more fleshed out wouldn't be that hard... Say....


[27-Oct-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Would you know of the in-game lore of VH-331c? I'll DM you the lore.... Would something like it be befitting of Harmonia, or would something more popular do some proper service?

**vidilet**:	Could you please tell me:   If production line do not have any orders, do workers consume the consumables? (If so, should I take all the food on the orbit, while we're waiting for ingredients?)


[06-Nov-24 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	Yes, they do consume. If you want to prevent consumption, either store them in the warehouse or a ship


[06-Nov-24 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	I believe buildings only take from your "base" stock


[06-Nov-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	just pull them into a warehouse, ship is too expensive


[06-Nov-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	also it takes a full day's worth of feed in advance


[06-Nov-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	so unless you're going to be taking days to resupply


[06-Nov-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	it's generally not worth it

**PumpAndDump**:	Hey all, I just upgraded my base (level 3) and it states Permits 3/4 but when I go to try and add a permit, it is greyed out and seems to be maxxed at 3/3. I have a free account. Is this the reason?


[06-Nov-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	your HQ permit limit is 4


[06-Nov-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	your base limit is 3, with diminishing returns


[06-Nov-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	free accounts are limited to HQ permit limit of 5


[07-Nov-24 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	No individual base can have more than 3 permits, 1000 area is the max per planet.


[07-Nov-24 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	that's probably a better way to put it

[12-Nov-24 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Second that, ADI discord is great because if you're new and a bit directionless, they have programs you can jump in and lend a hand with, usually at least partially covered by a grant


[12-Nov-24 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	if i canceled a flight


[12-Nov-24 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	why it still has to go to like 3 places i dont get  it


[12-Nov-24 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	cant it just turn around? xd


[12-Nov-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	my problem is that i sent it to the CX and then i got the mision to send it to the CX so yea..


[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Yeah it's kinda maddening but if you've started charging or approaching some place is like inertia is the law


[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	so i sent it for 1 minute


[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	and then i canceled


[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	and now in 17h will be back where it started?


[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Nov-24 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Nov-24 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	it doesnt say antares station anywhere and thats where it was


[12-Nov-24 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	There's a few jumps between Harmonia and ANT, you've cancelled it so it'll make the first jump as it already started the process


[12-Nov-24 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	and will it end up back into antares station?


[12-Nov-24 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	But it'll be chilling in space around Antares II star once it exits FTL


[12-Nov-24 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	oh ok and can i somehow tell it to go back to antares station?


[12-Nov-24 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	or i need to wait for it to stop?


[12-Nov-24 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	It's only going to take so long because you set lowest fuel consumption, looks like


[12-Nov-24 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	yes


[12-Nov-24 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	i read in a guide i should set lowest but now that im watching it i think what it sets by default is maybe more "efficient"?


[12-Nov-24 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	like idk what it takes to set the default fuel and reactor usage when you set a destination


[12-Nov-24 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Yeah I'm afraid you sealed your fate when you pressed the go button and then again when you pressed abort. Though you won't lose any time if you're able to reset the destination for ANT when it finishs its jump


[12-Nov-24 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	ok, and on consumtion you think i should use what it sets by default?


[12-Nov-24 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SQLi**:	or is just random


[12-Nov-24 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Personally (within reason) I set it for a time that I know I'll be available to retask my ship. But I have a few bases now that need attention


[12-Nov-24 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	But obviously, the faster you need something delivered by, the more expensive in fuel it gets

[04-Dec-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	But if INC are fed from local farm, than fast-complex recipe is like 30% more profitable than GRN. (And you'll have more farms and less INC to reach area limit)

**jvaler**:	yes it's right below the date field in the top left of CXPC


[12-Dec-24 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**vidilet**:	Hmmm... I think the trade volume is not accurately shown, also I think that I met a trading robot, and found the Flux buyer


[12-Dec-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	So I think Rakkzi, CEO of Bumblr Industries ( CO BMBL ) has bought out the Flux market and place it as an offer at 9x price


[12-Dec-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Also, I have placed my offer of Flux inside the price gap and it was immediately bought by this Bumblr , which makes me think of automation


[12-Dec-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	And more importantly, I have traded total of 1189 Flux, and it created a chart candle with volume of 7277, which is neither cash volume, number of items or weight


[12-Dec-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Aha. Apologies.  On a 5 minutes charts both my transactions are clearly visible with a correct volume of 'units sold'


[12-Dec-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	99.9% sure rakkzi doesn't automate


[12-Dec-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	they probably just have a tile on their main screen showing the FLX market, given it's their current attack against antares


[12-Dec-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	they're doing a little trolling

**caskman**:	If you'd like to help out I posted a bunch of ads at ANT to move the upgrade mats here, and a bunch of other mats I need


[30-Dec-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	The real reason is cost. Each 2 warehouse levels give 500 more in space. Each warehouse level is around 1mi. Finance-wise, Harmonia is running really low on taxes so the government income is 300k per week. Would take ~4 weeks with current tax levels to increase 1 warehouse level.


[30-Dec-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	To go from level 9 (Harmonia) to lvl 15 (Proxion) ... would take a lot of time or require increased taxes. Good thing we have great governor/parliament/residents who are willing to donate the mats.

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Comes out to 4500 per WH unit in use for the next level with a storage increase, so it's a pretty steep increase to get it paid back anytime soon.


[30-Dec-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	my understanding is that you don't govern a planet for the profit.


[30-Dec-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I've been playing with the opposite, slashing the LM & WH units down to free and running everything off of taxes, but the planet I did it on both had a previous sugar daddy that left a fat balance and has a low population that has largely forgotten about it.


[30-Dec-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Almost certainly not. Some are consistently in the red.


[30-Dec-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm 1.7M or so in the hole so far between the two I'm acting as caretaker for.


[30-Dec-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Given that one only really started up a matter of days ago and is a small little place, it's unlikely I'll recover it anytime soon (if at all).


[30-Dec-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Anyway, I'll fly in some additional mats to kick into the kitty next time I have a resupply ship coming.


[30-Dec-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Actually, @Frentic, since you're on the parliament here and at Deimos as well...you down with me just dropping some stuff on you at ANT? Divvy as you see fit to help comp that Deimos upgrade a bit more and assist here? Would just be some BBH/BSE.


[30-Dec-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Sure Pomme, thanks again o7, I can take care of bringing in the mats


[30-Dec-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@SanityCat: Planets are never managed to profit, but to pay its bills and get better infrastructure. For that to happen, either we donate (which is what the majority of governors do), or we tax accordingly to have . Taxes are used to balance costs and improvements, so we aim to have a good weekly surplus (what you would call profit). Here in Harmonia, however, the surplus is really low to be able to consider using it for planetary infrastructure improvements.


[30-Dec-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	But that doesn't stop us when someone asks for improvements... theres also great ppl who bundle together and donate these improvements. If you want to participate just let us know o7


[30-Dec-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Getting paid in BBH & BSE as part of a production cooperative in the region makes it easy to kick a bit to things. =p

**Tanda**:	You're also not quite at the point where you need to upgrade your ships yet


[04-Jan-25 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Unless you're transporting a lot of something or something really heavy, you generally won't need ship upgrades before your 4th planet


[04-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Water is heavy enough for me not to be able to bring week pack of water to harmonia. (plus fertilizers)


[04-Jan-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Not being able to fit it all in one trip is not the same as needing more shipping capacity


[04-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IIZard**:	Just build a rig and pump it yourself?


[04-Jan-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	While that's possible here, it's not optimal. Harmonia has low enough water concentration that it's more profitable to just import water and run straight farms here


[04-Jan-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I don't run any Rigs on the planet, I just import a shipload of water every now and then


[04-Jan-25 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IIZard**:	You're probably big enough where that min/max is important? But for smaller players, pumping that water might be worth the cost


[04-Jan-25 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	minmaxing is actually more important for smaller players. My operation is big enough I can afford to cut margin here and there

[04-Jan-25 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i don't think it's really even minmaxing, cause there's no downside to importing the water. FRMs produce more tonnage/volume than they consume, and you get better profit for less infrastructure cost by leaving out RIGs


[04-Jan-25 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	it's just better overall


[04-Jan-25 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	sorry to be clear, the tonnage/volume production means that there will always be empty space in your ship to add extra H2O


[04-Jan-25 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	so there's no added logistical cost to importing water

[15-Jan-25 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReganRotineque**:	eventually you need the time between things to work on planning, structuring your supply routes etc...


[15-Jan-25 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	The Anteres Development Initiative has a program to help get started where they give you tutoring in designing a second base, and then a grant (not loan) of 1M AIC to do it, which can help speed you up some.  You do need to be PRO though to get the money (game limitiation).  Discord invite here: https://discord.gg/N6bXSuvbuw .  Introduce yourselve in #server-airlock when you get there.

[26-Jan-25 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**iCooper**:	Until I buy an additional ship, i think i will continue to have excess production on Harmonia that i cannot ship to my food processing. I have posted new LM ads with discounted GRN/BEA/NUT compared to CX price if anyone needs any, else I will just ship them when i have time.


[31-Jan-25 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Feb-25 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	I do like blowjobs but I find the realities of housing and feeding ponies for all voting members of Harmonia to be too loosely defined. Is that a pony per POP or just per CEO?


[17-Feb-25 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	Where are all these blowjob givers coming from? Will you be shipping in the galaxies finest hoes and can the treasury support this?


[17-Feb-25 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	And finally please go into more detail on the measures you would take to ensure the safe and timely distribution of both ponies and blowjobs.


[17-Feb-25 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Okawari**:	It's probably a single pony and a blowjob, but everyone shares ownership of both the pony and the blowjob. I am not going to elaborate on how one can own shares of a blowjob tho

[26-Feb-25 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	Fake news MartinC1194! Says I tried to bribe him—totally false! I offered a tremendous opportunity. He refused. Not my fault he’s bad at business!


[26-Feb-25 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	Yes, use tax income to buy a vote.


[26-Feb-25 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	Smart thinking, MartinC1194! The people pay taxes, the people get free ponies and blowjobs. It’s called 'giving back!' Only a fool would oppose it


[26-Feb-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	If you have a problem with the tax increase, just let you know something. We increase the tax because the governor uses his own production filled Popr.  He gets payment is lower than the CX bid price. That is why the planet was low tax.


[26-Feb-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	If you can fill Popi consumption with lower than CX price, pls let us know.


[26-Feb-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	As you see, the planet finance is not good. My daily income is better than the planet finance. If you wanna to buy YES from me. Pls pay me 10M or more.


[26-Feb-25 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	Taxes? Way too high. Disgusting! We should be cutting taxes, not stealing from the people’s pony and blowjob fund! Who’s running this place, communists?


[26-Feb-25 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	Study history!


[26-Feb-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	I know history, MartinC1194. The greatest history! And history tells us high taxes kill economies, kill ponies, and kill morale. Very bad!


[26-Feb-25 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	yeah. Then, pls filled the Popi without payment from government, if you can do that. I think we can reduce tax.


[26-Feb-25 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	If you do that, you are our hero. But you are not.


[26-Feb-25 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_sashkaa**:	Let’s be clear, MartinC1194—I’m not just any leader. I’m a genius when it comes to filling the Popi. But filling it for free? Sorry, folks, it’s not magic! Heroes don’t work for nothing!


[26-Feb-25 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**martinc1194**:	Reduce tax but need 70% of finance from gov.  u kinda fun.

**lguth3728**:	up to 10% interest depending on the length of repayment.


[12-Apr-25 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lguth3728**:	I can do up to 300,000 AIC


[12-Apr-25 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i don't think you're going to get many hits on that when people can just send a loan request to lowstrife for 5m (assuming 5+ bases) @ 3% over 8 weeks and it could be accepted without even any messages


[12-Apr-25 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	not trying to burst your bubble, but you're better off investing back on yourself, it'll be a much higher cashflow generation


[12-Apr-25 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	as far as number of contracts, i don't know anyone who relys on that


[12-Apr-25 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	the only reason to pad contract count is to buffer breaches, but you should also be doing your best to avoid breaches


[12-Apr-25 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	if you get a lot of stuff shipped or transport yourself will get you a good contract rating


[12-Apr-25 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	yeah, even though shipping doesn't pay well it can get you cont count if you really want

**opie**:	you can do this in a matter of days if you go to the discord and get grants


[30-Apr-25 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	13x FRM on harmonia is also fine for one of your next bases


[30-Apr-25 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	main thing is just to make whatever is profitable.  try to look for stuff that yields <10 day ROI on prunplanner


[30-Apr-25 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i try to understand, firstiful its english and second its nerdy :D FRM seems to be farm. BMP basic material production maybe... i play in german and i have no plan, maybe a little, the game takes plenty of time and the fuel is not cheap. i have to make my first steps...


[30-Apr-25 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	and don't be obsessed with filling the whole supply chain by yourself.  use the CX for inputs!


[30-Apr-25 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	RAT was my first choice to have it simple


[30-Apr-25 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i wanna buy some OVE and H2O to run my factory for a while


[30-Apr-25 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	RATs are a good choice because they are quite profitable. I would personally put food processors on Phobos and then you can make both DW and RATs and even some COF


[30-Apr-25 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Then you can put a FRM on harmonia and use that to supply your FP.  FRMs have very good ROI for small guys.


[30-Apr-25 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	small companies that is


[30-Apr-25 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	Exactly my plan, except for the choice of the starting area


[30-Apr-25 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	Phobos is a planet?! and where is it


[30-Apr-25 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-25 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	bleh


[30-Apr-25 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	type "SYSI ZV-307" in a new buffer

[30-Apr-25 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i cant find a search button to find systems


[30-Apr-25 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	yeah you have to find them from the map... which means you sort of have to know where everything is


[30-Apr-25 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	ok thx both of you


[30-Apr-25 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
