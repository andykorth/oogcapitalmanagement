As we grow its getting harder to keep up with your greedy expansions 💵 Please @ me and I will assign you the correct roles. I do not see us getting large enough for a bot


[11-Jun-22 07:43 PM] insensless72#0000
if you notice you are on a planet and do not have the correct roles (keeping in mind minor planets do not have roles in corp) assigned, let me know as well

Please add me to oog-301-heavy-time (if I'm not there). Also, @demeter doesn't work, for some reason. Maybe because the channel was renamed from KI-446b?


[14-Jul-22 08:25 AM] exeler#0000
I think we need to rename the role so that it matches the channel name

Some discord administration stuff:
* @sginga  and @.zogii  need shareholder roles. 
* Let's remove the ship named shipping channels ( #oog-2000-tayra  etc) They aren't really getting used now.
* Add an ANT planet for commerce on ANT with private contracts
* Personally, I prefer the "welcome sticker" thing to be off, cause it gets a little spammy. But maybe other people like it: http://kortham.net/temp/Discord_ePjWImbTxD.png

I'm okay losing the named ship channels, the amount of channels is getting a little overwhelming. And I can post my adventures with the Planet Express in the regular shippiing channel 🙂 its only occasionally that I have space to offer anyway lol


[22-Nov-22 09:59 PM] yuen8241#0000
I support designing channels according to airline routes. There are more and more boats. If everyone watches the channels one by one, the efficiency is too low.

Nevermind, QJ's purple


[22-Dec-22 02:39 AM] seraphx2#0000
planets should just all be the same color.


[22-Dec-22 02:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
With how many planets there are... Might be best to color-code by sector/CX region/major-production/role rather than individual planets. It prolly made sense early on, but at this point there's dozens and the colors no longer really mean anything.


[22-Dec-22 02:39 AM] seraphx2#0000
everyone gets the same base color, then shareholder, and then any other administrative roles.


[22-Dec-22 02:40 AM] seraphx2#0000
these are just so people know where you operate. don't really see a need for any color.


[22-Dec-22 02:40 AM] seraphx2#0000
and it means trying to find colors is less of a chore


[22-Dec-22 02:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Valid


[22-Dec-22 03:01 AM] allocater#0000
I think the idea was that planet colors are just overwritten anyway


[22-Dec-22 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, since everyone ends up with a bunch of planets, the colors are only helpful to distinguish between trial members, shareholders, and other special roles

Some planets have too small of a OOG population so we don't bother with roles. There are planets that some of us have bases on that aren't even on the spreadsheet lol

Tree has been selling HER and FIM to me, and I can share them if any of you need them.


[12-Jan-23 08:22 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Are you in ANT space?  I think the potential to trade with our corp members (at market prices, not discounted prices) has been something we've considered important in the past


[12-Jan-23 08:22 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yuen is all over the place, but most of our members are centered around ANT.


[12-Jan-23 08:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If you're active and trading with Yuen, and plan to end up with operations in ANT space, I don't have an issue, but flagging for discussion

[12-Jan-23 08:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
A WCB is enough to maintain this industrial chain.


[12-Jan-23 11:01 PM] martin1194#0000
I will extend to ANT. But need a few day to do it.
I will try to provide RAT in ANT in the future but now still can't cuz I still import RAT from the market.

[21-Jan-23 08:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
I found a bunch of SE farm planets in Mor area. Maybe we can find a useless planet in ANT area to build a new electronic planet.

Do we invite katoa players to join the server? If he is suitable, I can sponsor some ANT bases to transfer his business center to ANT. Before that, I can also serve as a trading hub to sell his products to ANT. If he is not suitable, at least several new players will enliven the atmosphere, and there will be one more potential trading partner.


[23-Feb-23 12:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
Katoa is full now.


[23-Feb-23 12:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you don't want to, I will refuse him. After all, he is a very new player.


[23-Feb-23 12:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
Katoa players can at least build ppf and WPL to produce something that is easy to transport and then ship it to ANT for sale. Just like I bought FIM of tree at HRT and sold it to you at ANT.

It's kind of just for pings, but we don't really do a lot of that anymore. It was more useful at the start of the universe when people were only on two or three planets and you had to know who shared a planet with you
