**Kiriaster**:	So, coming to The Brain Trust because I'm confuzzled.  Just started a new base here on Verdant.  Only Pioneers in use, same as in my base on Montem.  I have RAT, DW, OVE, & PWO for my workers on both bases.  However, when I look at the efficiency factors for production lines on the two planets, I see on Montem Pioneers are 87% (what I expected) but on Verdant the Pioneers are only at 83%.  Why is it lower on Verdant?


[29-Sep-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	not enough hab space?


[29-Sep-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kiriaster**:	Poop.  Habs.  @Xk37 for the win.  Thank you.  :)


[29-Sep-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	is any1 ever gonna help that 1 jobless technician that is all unhappy and lonely?


[29-Sep-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	He isn't lonely. He's got a pen pal: the jobless engineer on Montem! (I think they're in love.)


[29-Sep-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	He should go visit, and bring some pioneers with him on emergency work visas.


[29-Sep-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	o yeeee montem needs more pioneers


[29-Sep-21 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	387 open jobs there wow


[29-Sep-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	even more open jobs for the techies... our unhappy techie could go there to work


[29-Sep-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chimaera**:	If anyone need shipping Montem>Verdant I'll be accepting contracts for the next 12 hours or so.


[29-Sep-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	lol when i started it seemed better than RAT


[29-Sep-21 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	now im wondering if i should make DW myself or just buy from cx


[29-Sep-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	oh shit


[29-Sep-21 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	too much stimulus the pioneers don't even want to work these jobs


[29-Sep-21 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh no did they raise the minimum wage again? Are they giving the PIO's KOM now?


[30-Sep-21 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Flying Montem > Verdant soon.  Leaving Montem in 12-14 hrs.  Got lotsa space (400 max).


[30-Sep-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	@Madmonk that must be some pretty darn good water you got there... 80k/u


[30-Sep-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yup, I offer only the best


[30-Sep-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	He spikes it with halluceno... um... never mind.


[30-Sep-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	It's "Eau de Madmonk" - very special and rare


[30-Sep-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Similar to Channel No. 5, but very different, I've heard


[30-Sep-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hahaha I imagine it must be "special" for that price


[30-Sep-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	gives you the essence of Rasputin


[30-Sep-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Now there's a character


[30-Sep-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'm reading a book on Rasputin. WTF you couldn't write stranger fiction


[30-Sep-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Yeah he dont die


[30-Sep-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Oh, dear... am I reading this right?  We've run out of pioneers?


[30-Sep-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Yeah we need some more upkeep maybe another level soon


[30-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Being pretty new about these things, @Smartdog - how does that work?  What has to happen so we're not limiting industry?


[01-Oct-21 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	OK, Ship just launched from Montem, ETA Verdant ~23 hrs hence.  Hauling 8 small loads; I feel like a Fed Ex driver, with lotsa Amazon boxes.


[01-Oct-21 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hahahaha


[01-Oct-21 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	each load be like 15t or less

[01-Oct-21 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i think i might need a DW supplier.....


[01-Oct-21 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	a single supply or regular?


[01-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	looking like regular, but I need a day or so to see if the new production schedule fixes it.   Might be like 200 week maybe a little more


[01-Oct-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I'd see about helping McG, but since I can't get my FPs staffed... :)


[01-Oct-21 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	i'm taking all reading materials away from the pioneers so they don't become educated


[01-Oct-21 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	OK, so there is a lot of talk in the UFO Verdent Chat about how to fix the Pio issue. First and foremost we need to suppply the SUN and OFF for the Safety station, next we need to upgrade the Safety Station.  I feel like if we all work together this will not be an issue, the upgrade cost and upkeep cost are not really that high.


[01-Oct-21 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Ok, OFF is hard to find on the CX, but I but all that was on hand.  I will have it shipped over ASAP


[01-Oct-21 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	also picked up 100 SUN to have shipped over


[01-Oct-21 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Shipping ads posted for the 2 upkeep items on the Monty LM


[01-Oct-21 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	sorry the Verdant LM


[01-Oct-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - I’m new to Verdant, and not sure how upkeep works. I’m fairly new, but just set myself up to produce OFF. Most of it is going to the Moria CX, and Montem (my main base) could easily swallow it up (unless other suppliers step up).


[01-Oct-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I could get some to Verdant, but I’m not in a position to donate all needed. My production is just ramping up, and I would need to ship it from Montem.


[01-Oct-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	if you make it, I will buy it...and get it here.  Your base will not need it on Montem, just the Montem infrastructure will need it.  DM me when you have it for sale, if possible I can buy it on the Montem LM and will post the ad and eat the fees, no issues.....


[01-Oct-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Further More---I know that GTU is not the only larger Corp on Verdant, I really think that if we work togetehr we can get this taken care of


[01-Oct-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Do you expect to buy the Mats with Tax money, or need us to donate?


[01-Oct-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Either's OK, just checking.


[01-Oct-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I will supply some (but not much) SUN, but not for a week or two. (those damn uniforms sure eat up the C, don't they?)


[01-Oct-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i will need to build a HB1 and BMP first but eventually I can supply the planet with SUN


[01-Oct-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but yea right now i am broke... so probably need at least 2 weeks to make that happen


[01-Oct-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	we have no GOV here so we either need to work together or suffer together


[01-Oct-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	or build the ADM so we can elect a GOV to do all this with Tax money


[01-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	@IDK if you build that here, let me know, I can supply the C


[01-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i just got an inc so im good on the c


[01-Oct-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	the problem with GOV is that we need a person who has the motivation to be gov


[01-Oct-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	not sure if there is someone here who wants to


[01-Oct-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	why not have one representing gov and the gov form a corp that has like ard 3 people with each contributing to Verdant?


[01-Oct-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	because i was thinking about having people who can cover different time frames so that at least one of the members would be online at any time


[01-Oct-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	since i think a lot of us are in different countries and play at different times... we can have like weekly discussions on what we should do and stuff


[01-Oct-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	what happens if we cant pay the upkeep in time?


[01-Oct-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - The cleanest solution I see is that you post a buy ad on Montem for OFF. Best to make sure that it fits what I can do. We’ll put the pricing below the CX, so my “opportunity cost” is my contribution to Verdant.


[01-Oct-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	You = whomever deals with this.


[01-Oct-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If I put a sell ad up, it might get sniped, unless I am near CX price (whatever that is…).


[01-Oct-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My EPO has just started “cooking,” so it’s a day before it shows up on Montem.


[01-Oct-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Rubi on Montem buys stuff off the CX, so the bulk of my output will go there, but I’m aiming that it ends up going back to Montem if needed. My output is around 120/day, and Montem needs 90. I don’t know if anyone else is making it; they need their own EPO.


[01-Oct-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i would set up a buy order for OFF... but im seriously low on funds right now at 3 digits. but it is a foreseeable solution once i have a steady income flow


[01-Oct-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Later on, I will ship what I can to Verdant myself. But my ships are tied up, and the OFF won’t appear until tomorrow anyway.


[01-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea... if i accept the contract it will take ard 1 day 10hrs total to fly back here... if any1 else can ship that faster it wouuld be great because my ship will only reach MOR in 6.5hrs


[01-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	would*


[01-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'm sure I heard the higher ups discussing this. Perhaps somebody wants to drop into the SNF lobby? Several players/corps working together would probably solve this. Just needs coordination?

**Xenogenic**:	https://discord.gg/8FK5kgZFw6


[01-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	McG - yeah, duh, sry, forgot there's no Gov here!


[01-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I'm happy with No Gov, and glad to contribute what I can, though that won't be much.


[01-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	People who want to contribute monetarily could put Buy Ads on Verdant LM.


[01-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Set Price a bit low, maybe very low - that makes it a way of sharing cost between producers & monetary contributers.


[01-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Ads for POPI Mats to be used here could be flagged by adding $7.15 to Price (for YI-715...)


[01-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the problem now with no Gov is that more people are coming here, increasing the demand for pioneers which cant be filled because the happiness level right now is barely raking in more pioneers


[01-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	for those new players it is difficult for them to contribute materials towards popi since they don't have much


[01-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yeah, with 140 Bases, we might need Gov't.


[01-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but having one player alone be gov will need a lot of commitment right now to solve our problem... that was why i was thinking about the corp idea with 3-4 people to takle everthing together


[01-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I like that idea.  I sure wouldn't want to be Gov - way too much time & worry - and even worse, I'd probably suck at it.


[01-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	But a Planet-local Corp could spread the pain across several (volunteer) "Ministers".


[01-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Has this been tried elsewhere?


[01-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	idk


[01-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can be part of the gov... but once sch starts again i can max play for 2-3 hrs a day not including random checking here and there...


[01-Oct-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Either way, probably some kind of Govt is gonna be needed long term... We're not a little frontier town anymore!


[01-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	we did it on a an ALOmining planet and a copper Mining plnet last universe....all we really need is a few people from each corp to feed the upkeep. it is not that expensive. Dawn Foods just picked up my shipping ads to bring SUN/OFF over......so they will be here soonish....I think I drop just over 30k to get 100 SUN and 50 OFF ( thst is there was on the CX).....spreading that out makes it much less


[01-Oct-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Right now we use 10/day of OFF and SUN, that will go up, but it is a huge amount, but 1 person should not have to fit the bill. If anyone wants to help out even by donating funds, that can be done as well. All that is needed is to buy an item from someone for however much you want to donate. Selling a H2O for 500 ncc is simple or what ever the amount is


[01-Oct-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, that is supposed to say "it is NOT a huge amount"


[01-Oct-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	in a few weeks i can probably help with some of the SUN needs... but a BMP needs pioneers so idk if it will be running after i build it


[01-Oct-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol the compound issues... "I'll just use my Montem BMP... oh no also out of PIO"


[01-Oct-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So hell if I know what the coordinated response is... do I just buy OFF and send it here?


[01-Oct-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	at least for a little while.....i will source what I can and get to planet as soon as I can


[01-Oct-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	after i sell my RAT on the cx I can probably help out a little with the cost since even if i build a BMP there won't be any pioneers working in it


[01-Oct-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	For OFF, my first batch of 100 will be ready overnight (N. American time zones), and I can send it to Verdant from Montem. (The next wave is earmarked for Montem.) Either I can get shipping contract and sell it on the LM on Verdant, or someone can put a buy order on the LM on Montem. For this batch, I’d like 35/u, since I spent a lot on expensive CL, and built a second POL. (That’s well below the CX bid of 80/u). Longer term, I’ll be selling it below cost as my “tax contribution” on the LM.


[01-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	It’s entirely likely that a sell order on the LM at that price would get sniped by someone unaware of the situation. PM me to let me know when you put the buy order up, or are ready for a pickup.


[01-Oct-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i have a ship reaching montem in 7hrs but will go to cx first before heading back to verdant


[01-Oct-21 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you can set the shipping price low at like 5ncc total i dont mind... because my ship wont be full anyways so might as well... that is if your shipping time is slower


[01-Oct-21 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	IDK - we can do that


[01-Oct-21 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	In 7 hours, I’ll be asleep, so wouldn’t be able to provision until about 10 hours. My ships are tied up, so I can’t ship it myself.


[01-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you could post the ad now and i will collect from montem when i reach... maybe set the time for delivery to be 3 days


[01-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	o wait nvm i read that wrong i think


[01-Oct-21 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can stop by after the cx and pick it up on the way back


[01-Oct-21 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	That’s simpler.


[01-Oct-21 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Thanks for taking care of this you guys


[01-Oct-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	for those that are focusing on your own growth or don't have much, you can maybe contribute a few DWs every now and then to help out with the upkeep... if we don't have to worry about DW we can focus more on the other materials


[01-Oct-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	your contribution doesn't have to be big... even single digit numbers of DWs will be greatly appreciated


[01-Oct-21 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	5 drinking water? Sorry I can't spare it


[01-Oct-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	like i said... every now and then. it doesn't need to be very often but if you ever have any extra.. even 1-2 is okay


[01-Oct-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we just want people to contribute in some way for every1's benefit


[01-Oct-21 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	So everything is functioning on my end, current workforce 600 (0) does the (0) mean there's no more available if I were to build a pioneer hab?


[01-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	That’s the change since the last report. The number you can hire when you build is shown on the construction screen.


[01-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ye... we have a shortage at the moment


[01-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	For PIOs, that will be (1).


[01-Oct-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	ah I see now


[01-Oct-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	that 0 is how many you borrowing from the POPI pool....that number becomes yours at the next POPI report....so if it is0 then you dont need any or there are non to loan


[02-Oct-21 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so is it still useful to build ´buildings or should i wait?


[02-Oct-21 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i think it would be better to wait? since if you build now there would only be 1 pioneer working which increases the time to idk how many days proabably and yet you would still have the building depreciation


[02-Oct-21 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if you're building something needing only settlers then 103 settlers are available right now


[02-Oct-21 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	;/


[02-Oct-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yeah, I built a new RIG and only got 1 new worker, so I just slowed down all my other production.


[02-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	my plan was in the next 3-4 days to build around 12 buildings


[02-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeaaaaah


[02-Oct-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i even bought some bfabs to speed it up


[02-Oct-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	sooooo if someone wants to coliq and free up some workers i am 100% behind it xD


[02-Oct-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	The POPR is every 7 days yes?  Like... 168 hours?


[02-Oct-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	the last one was 2d 12h agao and comes every 7 days


[02-Oct-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	this is panic


[02-Oct-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	pioneers need to understand they just can't lay around and collect unemployment


[02-Oct-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	they need to work at jobs here


[02-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	they are getting an education so they can become settlers and collecting unemployent


[02-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	unbelievable


[02-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	them pioneers get educated to settlers and then become unhappy that there are no jobs and leave... why must they be like this


[02-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@McGangsta 's batch of upkeep items going to arrive in 7 hrs


[02-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@AngryK1tten 's batch of OFF will arrive in 1 day 12-ish hrs... sorry mb the amount of fuel i used should be more but if i use up now i won't be able to fly ship 2 out until my ship 1 bring more fuel back


[02-Oct-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	btw i 1 sst enough?


[02-Oct-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	or do you need to make more


[02-Oct-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we need to have a second one... but currently I'm not even sure we can sustain the one we have long term because only a handful produce/can get the upkeep materials (SUN and OFF)


[02-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, there should be a market for them soon


[02-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	lots of places need SSTs now


[02-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and lots of people have BMPs


[02-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but for us we have the problem of not many being able to contribute to the upkeep and that OFF and SUN are not cheap... we cant expect those poviding for us now to continue on forever like this because they are currently taking a loss


[02-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so start a government and collect taxes?


[02-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	It's really not that big ofa deal


[02-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	No one is going to let Verdant stop progressing


[02-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	If there is a need it will be filled out of necessity


[02-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	that would mean that some people are contributing the amount that many here aren't...


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but yea i get what you mean... just that it is not really a good thing always depend on others no?


[02-Oct-21 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Eh honestly we shouldn't even be dealing with this, there are much older and larger companies on Verdant that would take a much smaller hit for taking care of these things than us month or two month old accounts


[02-Oct-21 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Worse case scenario, nobody steps up and the people covering things now step down and the cost of letting things stagnate and avoiding things becomes so expensive that it outweighs footing the bill


[02-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I guess larger and older companies have the luxury of not taking a big hit if they don't contribute as well. idk if things get too catastrophic, there's always the option to demolish what's excess and start saving up for base 2


[02-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ngl... i just want to help every1 here because i know a good chunk are starting/growing players with Verdant as their first base and we are the ones that are impacted the most


[02-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i would rather build a bmp and take a small backstep in my plan to make and contribute some of the SUN needed than to depend on the larger companies who probably have other planets to contribute and focus on


[02-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Well if you put together a bmp that's one way to help


[02-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i will... but even if i do it now no pioneers to work


[02-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I built a pio hab and a farmstead with the pioneer shortage and it's running


[02-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	So I think it'll run if you build it


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	the shortage probably cuts from efficiency of all of your productions evenly


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	is the efficiency normal?


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	No


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	oh


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	it's 99% on all


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	but still it's running


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	So make that bmp man


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In all fairness the new players are affected least


[02-Oct-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	given the way the worker redistribution happens


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i need the HB1 first... and didnt account for that


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	those who employ the most pioneers will lose some at the end of the week


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but new players they need to expand the most


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	you could demolish something to make room for the bmp


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	100 pios tho wew


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not gonna do that


[02-Oct-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	cant really destroy the balance of my 9 production lines rn


[02-Oct-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	rip


[02-Oct-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	guess I could do it but I don't have the ove C PG or EPO to make any of this stuff


[02-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i have c


[02-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Would have to ship it


[02-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I guess if we could get some folks to chip in OVE and C


[02-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Someone could get started on the SUN


[02-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i think the only thing i need is PE


[02-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	cos im making RCO


[02-Oct-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hahaha my FPs have enough inputs for like more than a month of RAT production so i thought of using my FRMs to grow other crops


[02-Oct-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Yeah does anyone have a bmp that they would be willing to make some SUN with if we got them OVE and C?


[02-Oct-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can probably do it myself... after two weeks or a little less depending on the pioneer supply


[02-Oct-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I think you just said you're unwilling so let's see if anyone else can take care of this


[02-Oct-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hopefully by the time i get the stuff needed for the HB1 we have excess pioneers and no open jobs


[02-Oct-21 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	im only unwilling to destroying something already on my base to build the bmp


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Yeah makes sense, I'm sure someone on this planet has a BMP so let's just see


[02-Oct-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procytron**:	I've got plenty of OVE on Verdant. If someone need some for SUN I can provide them


[02-Oct-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Sweet OVE covered then!


[02-Oct-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	One of us will shoot you a message if we can locate a bmp or get one made


[02-Oct-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I think C should be easy enough to find


[02-Oct-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Just gotta find someone with a bmp that's willing to process it


[02-Oct-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I wonder if someone's already stockpiling


[02-Oct-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Even if we had everything it would take a while with one bmp


[02-Oct-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Oh well I guess not


[02-Oct-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Since it comes in batches of 50 off or 20 sun


[02-Oct-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procytron**:	I'm bringing 100 OFF too for the SST


[02-Oct-21 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procytron**:	Only issue for me is C for SUN. I can't have enough right now


[02-Oct-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i dont have much since i only have 1 inc but i think @McGangsta said something about being able to supply some?


[02-Oct-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - I got in late. My Montem base is manufacturing/chemistry. I shipped 100 OFF, and I can look into SUN.


[02-Oct-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	OFF is the big problem now since there’s no EPO on the CX.


[02-Oct-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	those big players supplying EPO stooped


[02-Oct-21 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	From my perspective, the simple solution is that I just ship OFF/SUN when I do a supply run, and offer at a subsidised rate on the LM.


[02-Oct-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If someone swaps me the C, then the SUN would be dirt cheap.


[02-Oct-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	how dirt cheap?


[02-Oct-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I can get some SUN


[02-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I got a guy who owes me a favor


[02-Oct-21 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	How cheap? somebody’s contribution to the Verdant cause is to give me 10 C for free, I could supply 10 SUN at my internal price for OVE plus worker upkeep for 4 hours.


[02-Oct-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I can provide 60 at no cost


[02-Oct-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	should last us ~30 days


[02-Oct-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can probably give 10 C every 2-3 days for free


[02-Oct-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	That works. I’d have have to process over a few days, and deal with shipping.


[02-Oct-21 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I have a BMP if that helps.  BTW, why not just buy the SUN from Moria?


[02-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	On a different topic - I'd like to build a LAB at some point.  What do we need to do to get some technicians on Verdant?


[02-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I’m a manufacturer, and my opportunity cost subsidy to this are my “taxes” to Verdant.


[02-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	build it, and see how many come?


[02-Oct-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	The TECH population won’t grow without open jobs (?).


[02-Oct-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	need to increase their happiness first


[02-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	the one tech has a 100% unemployment rate, torpedoing happiness.


[02-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yep


[02-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Just wondering if it is enough just to have open jobs or would we need a planetary project too.


[02-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If I give him enough COF do you think that tech will work some 24hr shifts when I open the LAB?


[02-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Montem had them with no infrastructure (until recently).


[02-Oct-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	techs can just come to the planet i think


[02-Oct-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	only engineers and scientists really need the education stuff


[02-Oct-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, supplied all the OFF and SUN that I could get a hold of, will last us 5 days for the OFF and 30 days for the SUN


[02-Oct-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Thanks.


[03-Oct-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I have 150 OFF on MOR Station that needs to get to Verdant, seeing as it id for the POPI upkeep, I would like someone to take it for free if possible


[03-Oct-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	DM if you can help


[03-Oct-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	How much space is it


[03-Oct-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - I have 100 OFF coming here already. I will be able to ship what Verdant needs in the future on my weekly supply runs to Verdant.


[03-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	that is great news.....


[03-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Not exactlynsure when my shipment will arrive, but probably within a day.


[03-Oct-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	not so much for Montem, which was supposed to buy the OFF from me off the CX. 😬


[03-Oct-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i jsut bought some, was it from you


[03-Oct-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Yup.


[03-Oct-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and @Ayaaa its 30m


[03-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	lol


[03-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	well I guess I am doing my part


[03-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	This is the price that Rubicate pays for using the CX instead of the Montem LM…


[03-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ahh, well then we need to talk, I do not mind helping offset the cost


[03-Oct-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@AngryK1tten my ship will reach verdant in like ~11hrs


[03-Oct-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	the shipping ad is up onthe verdant LM


[03-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Ok. My plan was that I would sell people on Verdant OFF at a heavily subsidised price for upkeep. My “opportunity cost” is my “tax payment”


[03-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	IDk - thanks, i saw your comment about fuel on global…


[03-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	sure, I can get dowen with that, i think we all should


[03-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hahaha yep

**McGangsta**:	mb...MotorBoat.....you dawg


[03-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Since you bought some full price, I can do an outright donation with a chunk of the 100, and then I’ll sell at 35/U.


[03-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	perfect


[03-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Unless the number if safety stations is ramped up a lot, I can keep up with Verdant’s needs easily. 100 OFF lasts just over 9 days, I believe.


[03-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	something like that


[03-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, i gotta run


[03-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but we also need to consider another SST


[03-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	which increases the upkeep


[03-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	we do, but lets get this one feed first

[03-Oct-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Monk has some CL on the CX, and then Ragnarok. I really hope somebody is buying cheap BSE’s off Moria to build EXT to get HAL.

**IDKanything**:	my cx order for fuel only filled up 2hrs after i left montem... couldve flown to cx to pick it up but too late


[03-Oct-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	so i just now sent ship + RATs to cx to pick the fuel


[03-Oct-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Well at least I can say I tried to help out

[03-Oct-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I've got a few bfabs coming in


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I can mostly finish the safety station upgrade when IDK's ship arrives with some bfabs I posted. It will still need 3 BTA and 1 BBH.


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	23 minutes 14 seconds


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Can you go back in time and get me to send some BTA?


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can get the bta


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but gonna take like 1 day plus to come back


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	cos need to save fuel now... i have spent like a lot on fuel since getting pro... making profits from it still but damn couldve made more if i wasn't so eager to ship everything every time


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Lots of shipping ads on Montem LM to come here, if you are looking for cargo to the two tiny ads you just took from me.


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i took a few previously alrdy i think


[04-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but ye gonna take one or two of them


[04-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and maybe on the way back to montem you can take the ads so my base doesnt strave QQ


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - I just dropped off 21 OFF for the SST, and have 79 that I will sell on the LM for 35/u for people to contribute. That’s a decent subsidy versus the 100/u bid on the CX, which is my “tax contribution” to Verdant.


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Going forward, I produce OFF on Montem, my main base. Even with a second SST, I can make sure that I have enough OFF in inventory here for upkeep needs.


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we are 2 BTAs from upgrading


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	(For those who don’t keep up with the OFF market, it needs EPO, and there’s no EPO on the CX. When EPO returns, OFF won’t be a problem.)


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Anyway - I can either post sell orders, or somebody else posts buy order(s). Once again, I’ve got 79 units at 35/unit. That will keep things going for awhile.


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i make an ad


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	thx


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Yay. So we’re covered for awhile.


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	does the pioneer population only increase when the popr comes out or do we have to provvide them with jobs first for them to come?


[04-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Changes happen on the POPR release (other than employing unemployed peeps). Presumably, having “open jobs” helps attract PIOs.


[04-Oct-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Open jobs increases happiness which is what dictates growth. They'll grow beyond open jobs if they're happy (needs are met)

[06-Oct-21 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so should we do the same trick as in montem? a few hours before the new pop report build all the buildings so we get migration?


[06-Oct-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can build an inc


[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	how many of us can build buildings rn?


[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i can build like 6 farms 3 fp and an incin


[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i can build 1 FRM and 1 INC rn


[06-Oct-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**McGangsta**:	what day is out POPI report


[06-Oct-21 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	new pop report in 15h


[06-Oct-21 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	sweet


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Wouldn't be surprised if we're all in trouble.  There were 600 unfilled PIO positions before the last POPR, you (@Nocknuck) want 500, I want 250, I've seen other people talking about building more buildings... it'll be interesting to see what we get.  Last few weeks increase was only about 1.5K-2K, though a couple of weeks before that it was 7K-8K.


[06-Oct-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yolo


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	someones gonna be sad in 6 hours xD


[06-Oct-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	btw i think the last 600 open jobs were filled by the last pop report


[06-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	We should have enough happiness to get decent migration with the added upkeep materials. If you need a lot of pops though best to get the buildings before the report in case the reserve pool is small (210 on Montem)


[06-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah i build my stuff and i need 500 pio


[06-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i hope i get them otherwise i am kinda boned xD


[06-Oct-21 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Not quite it's Open jobs - Change. So just over half


[06-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'm pretty sure we only had DW in the SST before this report too


[06-Oct-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	One would think, but... I built 5 FP and 1 RIG 30 minutes before the POPR, and I got all my buildings fully staffed.


[06-Oct-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	like those older buildings without full workforce get piority


[06-Oct-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	... so it pioritise backwards?


[06-Oct-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I have no idea about the prioritization, but I know what I did and I know what my base has now :)


[06-Oct-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think the game doesn't understand math.  PIO poulation went from 58206 to 60406 (plus 2200)  but according to the report the change was 3200.


[06-Oct-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the change is from the migration - education no?


[06-Oct-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	When a player drops a new base, they get 200 PIOs regardless of whether or not there's any available in the population pool.  I expect that explains what you're seeing, @Ogrebeef


[06-Oct-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Otherwise you could never colonize an empty planet


[06-Oct-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	In other words the extra 1000 is from 5 new bases?


[06-Oct-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	That's my guess.  I know that the 200 for a new base is true.


[06-Oct-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The last population report showed an increase of 757 but says the change was 357.  That must mean 2 bases were demolished.


[06-Oct-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...or at least 2 HABs


[06-Oct-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	should we consider an ADM? or we continue with what we're doing now?


[06-Oct-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I think that what's happening now is unsustainable and doomed.  However, lots of people think differently.  So, I'mma keep quiet.


[06-Oct-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	^ same thoughts and im still wondering if my idea of a "council government" of 3-4 people would work


[06-Oct-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	You can't run a planet with 138 bases on the basis of voluntary contributions by people who are willing to do the work without recompense.


[06-Oct-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	If it's the right 3-4 people, maybe.


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I just landed a shipment of 120 OFF to stock up the safety stations further. I’m selling it at 35/u to whoever would be covering the donation. The safety station has a decent reserve, so there’s no rush. I’m also slowly catching up to demand on the CX, but we will need EPO supplies for the OFF market to be normal.


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	posted an ad

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Went from 600 open jobs to 4000?


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we all build buildings last minute to boost migration


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I wish I understood the algorithm for how it's allocating PIOs


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	^


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I mean, I got all of what I wanted, but with 4000 open jobs a lot of people didn't, obviously


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	only gained ~2000 PIOs


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That's a lot of buildings.


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i built my buildings like 50 mins ago so idts its according to the time they were built


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Really sucks because new stuff we build won't have pios


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	mayb it is like each player gets to gain a certain number?


[06-Oct-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	@IDKanything - If it's allocating according to time built, I think it must be giving priority to more recently constructed buildings


[06-Oct-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	shouldn't it be the opposite tho?


[06-Oct-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**IDKanything**:	i cant be the only person tho... also because im like 30-ish days in only


[06-Oct-21 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Here's a question.  Is it worthwhile to build a COGC on a planet with 1 base?


[06-Oct-21 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	it will be expensive to build...


[06-Oct-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	but the upkeep is based on the number of bases so it wouldn't be expensive to run.  Or are there added costs for the advertisment campaigns?


[06-Oct-21 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That's probably an excellent question for UFO discord. Plenty of guys there that already did just that and could tell you ^^


[06-Oct-21 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But yeah, IDK, I think you and folks like you are a good person to run... whatever ends up being the right thing. You're a neutral party between the major corps.


[06-Oct-21 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Although the POPI issues here on Verdant are almost identical to those on Montem. I wouldn't be surprised if generally the popi thing needs re-calibration or what.


[06-Oct-21 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Anyways, that's just me thinking out loud. My 2 cents.


[06-Oct-21 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea the popi thing seems to need a little tweaking


[06-Oct-21 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	next POPR if i can get enough materials for another HB1 plus 3 BSEs, I can probably help out with the SUN supply since i make more C than i need and using some here as contribution seems better than hauling all to the cx to sell


[06-Oct-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You haul C?


[06-Oct-21 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I guess it's profitable enough, especially now


[06-Oct-21 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	If you got a warehouse on Vallis, you could sell burnables directly there. I'd be super curious to see what works out being better money


[06-Oct-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i dont haul often... since one inc is only a few days old and the other is just built, but sold a few and have 68u right now but not really worth to ship


[06-Oct-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah that's the problem here. Before I joined SNF, I shipped everything to CX via shipping contract


[06-Oct-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ahh... ic


[06-Oct-21 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Now I just sell it internally. Just DW and RAT though. Typically since C is so heavy, the best practice is to fly in burnables and have the INC onsite where the SME's or BMP's are


[06-Oct-21 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And if you're solo on Verdant, it's really really hard to fill a ship properly and get max efficiency for the trip. At least fuel got nice and cheap.


[06-Oct-21 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea... not sure how much longer fuel's gonna stay that cheap


[06-Oct-21 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah who knows

[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	mostly to just drop $$$ on some new players though ^^


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea he's still around a little right now probably not for much longer though since he already announced his plans on stopping


[07-Oct-21 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It actually looks like we lost 5 bases between Population reports. Migration = LastPopulation * ( CurrentHappiness - 70) [Assuming happiness > 70]. The only way 3484 is .061% of the population is if the populations was 7206 (that's 5 fewer bases) and we consdier 76.1% happiness a slightly rounded number, which makes sense.

[07-Oct-21 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	farms take so many pop :(


[07-Oct-21 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea


[07-Oct-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I think the ability to expand base size beyond 500 caused a bunch of large bases to swell. During the last week I know I balloned from ~1080 required pio to ~1500 pio because of the upgrades. I expect others did as well.


[07-Oct-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Bases that had stopped expanding started again.


[07-Oct-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah... that makes sense... i still have a lot to learn


[07-Oct-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It's ok. You don't know anything.


[07-Oct-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea... hahaha kinda funny that i was watching the LMs and suddenly brrrrrrrrrr all the ads


[07-Oct-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Hydroa**:	I've got some SUN inbound. It'll show up after the next usage cycle, but it looks like we've got 10 beyond waht we need so things should stay full

[09-Oct-21 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PawnStorm**:	Every building must have 5 experts....


[09-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I prefer resiliency over efficiency.


[09-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I certainly make less profit this way, though


[09-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, efficiently producing everything for me means unsustainable logistics


[09-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or constantly posting buy ads


[09-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or keeping massive, costly stockpiles


[09-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course looking at my spreadsheet about my most self-contained planet, right now it's telling me that all my TO-392d profit is coming from the LST I'm not ruining by turning it into BSEs :(


[09-Oct-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I don't have to keep stockpiles and I don't constantly post buy ads. I fine-tune the production across all my bases so that I make a small surplus, which I periodically sell. It makes me more-or-less immune to shortages or price fluctuation. That's what I mean by resiliency.


[09-Oct-21 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	But I'm not at all claiming it's the best way to play the game. I know I've leaving money on the table. I'm okay with that.


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, the the logistics breakdown scenario for me


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm up to 6 bases now


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	2 ships would be enough to mange it with some automation features, because otherwise there's this time during the night when I'm asleep and I can't load/unload cargo


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Honestly those high efficiency models only really work when you get a lot of folks working as a team.


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hence that approach is used a lot within SNF


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	6 bases?!?! wow


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I had 10 or 11 in the last universe but it was really pushing the limits of what I could handle with two ships. Granted several of them were very small, specialized bases


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ahhh... ic


[09-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've been writing some software that helps me fine-tune the production across all my bases. Someday I may release it but the code is still in the embarrassingly amateurish stage


[09-Oct-21 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Shipping seems more expensive (time/fuel) compared to the last universe, so I don't think I could support 10-bases with just 2 ships now


[10-Oct-21 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	the cx's on stations did that


[10-Oct-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah yeah, on planet CXs would let you support 4 bases with 0 ships


[11-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yeah, IMO, (starter) CX's should be on the Capitol Planets, so new players can get used to everything else, then learn to fly.


[11-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Having to fly to CX for Cons's adds huge expense & logistical hassle for new players.  Just makes it harder, not more fun.


[11-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	And with FF, bigger universe increases use & demand.  CX's were all only 5-6 jumps apart last round?


[11-Oct-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I wish CXs were father apart, feels weird having 4 of them so close to eachother in such a big universe in my opinion.


[11-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I was hoping the same Azorth, I wanted 10+ jumps between each CX


[11-Oct-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chimaera**:	If anyone needs shipping Montem > Verdant let me know, I will be accepting contracts for the next 24 hours.


[11-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chimaera**:	I will have like ~300 units free.


[11-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	CX on planets would mean that there are effectively 4 starter planets and a bunch of other random nearby planets. Also inter-trading would be much more expensive since you'd have to do two landings instead of 0


[11-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	oh is it cheaper for fuel


[11-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	because you dont have to land and take off from an atmosphere on a station


[11-Oct-21 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think the justification that on-planet CXs would make those 4 planets just way better than every other planet is true


[11-Oct-21 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now, maybe the 4 starter CX systems should look more like Hortus with a planet super close to the CX

[25-Oct-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	or cxl price (~320)  - transport cost (~10-13ncc per unit) - insentive to pick it up (~50-100ncc)


[25-Oct-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	would be my rule of thumb


[25-Oct-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hmm...


[25-Oct-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah verdant grows stuff so people will most likely do their own burning


[25-Oct-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea i figured...


[25-Oct-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but have been relying on C since RAT dropped


[25-Oct-21 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	you can always just put in an ad for the first option since there could be people here for rat/dw


[25-Oct-21 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	since ads are free


[25-Oct-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	but i wouldnt count on them being picked up soon


[25-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	once i get my other bases according to my plan I probably can demolish the INCs and rebuild them on another base... but that wont be anytime soon


[25-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i got my 2 inc running on 3 forumla since C is really expensive atm

[29-Oct-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My problem with SUN is that I don’t have enough cheap C on Montem - where my BMPs and manufacturing experts are.


[29-Oct-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If I fly it in, I’d have to sell close to CX price (unless the CX price is ridiculous).


[29-Oct-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	We have 20 days supply of OFF, but I put up two 30 unit contracts on the LM for people to donate. I priced the contracts at 1000, which is just about the CX bid price.


[29-Oct-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Nov-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like my CLR needed to produce TRN 6 times and SWF once


[01-Nov-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and originally its queue was completely full with the recurring orders


[01-Nov-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-21 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Greetings fellow Verdantians, we painted ourselves up in a corner with poor fuel management and are stuck here at Verdant wiith our 2 ship fleet if anybody has STL and FF to sell it will be much appreciated. Kind regards. We have 2 fuel ads on the LM but price can be negotiated.


[03-Nov-21 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Hi - my SUN was taken. I should be able to keep shipments incoming, so I will let people know when it is available. I did not have much spare C, so this first shipment was small.

[03-Nov-21 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, cool, how much carbon does it take to make SUN


[03-Nov-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	It’s 10 C for 20 SUN.


[03-Nov-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	that is crazy, actually


[03-Nov-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	way to much C for that


[03-Nov-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	but, as a carbon farmer....good for me


[03-Nov-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My daily prouduction here is just over 12/day, and that covers my other needs. SUN is pretty carbon-intensive.


[03-Nov-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	12 C correct


[03-Nov-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Since I produce O, C, and STL here, I have no choice but to make regular shipping runs. So should be able to get some more SUN soon as needed.


[03-Nov-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, cool was gonna see if I could help out with the C


[03-Nov-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	ah yep 665


[03-Nov-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	total workforce for your base can be seen from your base overview


[03-Nov-21 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if you have the capacity (enough habitations) and workers in the brackets on construction page for the number you need can just build it and workers will be filled


[03-Nov-21 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Basically, "true happiness" is the number that guides the 5 week rolling average. When it starts to go below 70% actual happiness is sure to follow


[03-Nov-21 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And below 70% actual happiness is when you run into trouble


[04-Nov-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Thanks for the help


[04-Nov-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	@IDKanything if you want to figure out "True Happiness" you can do so with this sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1REe9X03CDXu2UoinPUrQGzekGfU9qla6OHCxvL4V3T0/edit#gid=0

[05-Nov-21 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	do you want his NUT?


[05-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm good, thanks though!


[05-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Thanks, but no thanks. It's no NUT November, after all


[05-Nov-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	Making RATs from VEG now not a single PIO fill fail no NUT november


[05-Nov-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	The real devious move is to make RAT with NUT then sell them on the exchange


[05-Nov-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**VicodinTaco**:	my 3rd :(


[05-Nov-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	(Whats a pol?)


[05-Nov-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I feel like my workers would be appreciative of more poles here, depending on what activities surround said poles


[05-Nov-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	yeah POL is for plastics.  Trying to find a way to put it in the food along with NUT


[05-Nov-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I mean it's probably filling


[05-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	you could advertise it as a health food because plastic doesn't have calories


[05-Nov-21 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	I would like to refer to § 20.4304 Food & Safety regulaions  that states: " No beverage produced in Verdant shall be inferior to an equal quality produce anywhere in the universe."

**AngryK1tten**:	My OFF/SUN shipment arrived. I’ve got 30 OFF for 1000 NCC, and 60 SUN broken into 3 lots of 20 for 210 NCC/unit. There isn’t a rush, and I’ll let you decide who wants to pick them up to donate.


[07-Nov-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If people wish, I’ll swap the 20 SUN for 14 C (if the ads are not taken already). Just let me know, and put up a buy for 20 SUN for 1 NCC, and I’ll put up a C bu ad.


[07-Nov-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My next shipment will have more OFF.


[07-Nov-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Anybody have 100 FF I can buy?


[07-Nov-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Buy is up on the LM. I didn't plan properly... please save me ^^


[07-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i should really take a shipload a fuel next time and park it in my base


[07-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	people get stranded here often


[07-Nov-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	it's because people use verdant as a stepping stone for reaching the outer heaven system


[07-Nov-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	last time i checked outer heaven fuel is like 2 times cheaper than montem cxl QQ


[07-Nov-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	what a time to be alive


[07-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	there wasn't much else to do on TD-228b other than refining fuel, so 4 of us all dropped a total of about 12 refineries on day 1, fuel supplies are.. in surplus


[07-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	lol you have more fuel than ships can consume


[07-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that is a unique situation xD


[07-Nov-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**blueGeek**:	hi, why all shipping contracts are to Vallis, but none from Vallis to Verdant or Moria or anywhere?


[10-Nov-21 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	I have an empty ship at Vallis and can ship anywhere.


[10-Nov-21 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Got a ton more exports on this planet then imports


[10-Nov-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Crops don't need anything else besides water, which is also gathered here.


[10-Nov-21 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	dang... who keeps buying SIO at such high prices... im throwing SIO into the cx every 2 days


[10-Nov-21 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Yeah, but Vallis produces lots of stuff and there aren't any big contracts shipping out.


[10-Nov-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I import more than I export, but I'm not paying full ship shipping fees


[10-Nov-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	They likely just ship it themselves, only things being imported are things like NS/FABs/DDT/BMP consumables


[10-Nov-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I import N and LST also


[10-Nov-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I pick those up on the way here


[10-Nov-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	have you joined the UFO chat? maybe can ask in the vallis channel if any1 needs to ship something to cx for cheap rates


[10-Nov-21 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	I've got about 50t of stuff I need to take back to Verdant from Moria Station. If people are making the trip anyway I might as well place a cheap shipping request


[10-Nov-21 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	thats like super low


[10-Nov-21 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Yup ;)


[10-Nov-21 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I wouldn't take that even if I was going with a completely empty ship


[10-Nov-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	^


[10-Nov-21 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	thats just like your paying for the hassle of handling a contract


[10-Nov-21 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	the hassle alone is worth much more than that.


[10-Nov-21 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	it's insulting


[10-Nov-21 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	I would


[10-Nov-21 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	7/max i wld accept but 2.37/max... just too low


[10-Nov-21 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Anyone wanna post that cheap? I'll make trip myself


[10-Nov-21 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	If I have to do a trip anyway. I'm not going to turn down free cash


[10-Nov-21 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you know its like ~4ncc/max for fuel right? and that doesnt take into account time + hassle


[10-Nov-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	depends on how much fuel you use... but like ard 3-4ncc/max


[10-Nov-21 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	500t full cargo bay is only 3 SF more than empty, time doesn't matter if I'm making the trip anyway and hassle? It's just a couple clicks of the mouse bro


[10-Nov-21 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	So if imma do the trip anyway, and a full cargo bay costs me 30ncc extra, why wouldn't I accept dirt cheap shipping contracts like that? It's free cash


[10-Nov-21 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Of course it's disrespectful to request something for that cheap. But if @blueGeek is making the trip anyway on a half empty cargo bay, I'm doing him a favour by giving him free cash


[10-Nov-21 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Players of Verdant, would you be interested in a parody of Sabaton named "Fields of Verdun"


[10-Nov-21 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	went to have a listen... and had my volume wayyyy too loud XD


[10-Nov-21 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Correction I meant to say Fields of Verdant as in a parody of Fields of Verdun


[10-Nov-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I could probably sell you some, depending on how much you need, in 20 hours when my ship arrives, but that may not help you much


[10-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	just saw your ad, if it's still there when my ship arrives I'll fill it

**Xenogenic**:	63.37% True Happiness


[10-Nov-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Although it looks like we wouldn't actually loose PIO's to migration unless we get below 50% actual happiness


[10-Nov-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but we losing them through education... they become settlers and then migrate out


[10-Nov-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yes that's happening due to the low settler hapiness. But they aren't leaving of their own accord


[10-Nov-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's funny, if we were to employ every one of them, True Happiness would go up to 70%


[10-Nov-21 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	4 SST's would also get us to 75% True Happiness... but I dunno if we should do that for freeloading PIO's


[10-Nov-21 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	do we need to consider a third SST?


[10-Nov-21 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Wasn't SST #2 just added a few weeks ago?  Thought that would be enough.


[10-Nov-21 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	How much safety does a SST provide?


[10-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	adding another SST would also mean higher upkeep... and by the looks of who contributes it would be the same few people taking the hit


[10-Nov-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'm getting some DW for it now


[10-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	technically we are still ok in terms on pio numbers... but that would change once we need to build more buildings


[10-Nov-21 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	481 pio available for each player from the reserve pool


[10-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So we have 3333 safety from the SST's and 7200 from player bases


[10-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	PIO's need 21386 atm


[10-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So we're only meeting about half


[10-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	However, if we employ them all, true happiness goes back up despite the safety shortfall


[10-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I know there is a wiki page that explains how that is calculated.  Do you have the link?


[10-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I have this ready made tool


[10-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Which you can copy and play with


[10-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Rek made it. Basically it's how I learned everything I know about POPI... not an expert but I think I grasp it now


[10-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Basically the equation of "do you need more POPI" isn't always straightforward... how much growth are we anticipating we'll have?


[10-Nov-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Employing them all would work and we could skate by for a while yet before they actually started to leave


[10-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think I read that a fully operational SST provides 2500 safety.  Are ours not getting sufficient upkeep?


[10-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we could see if the next POPR is any better? i mean we aren't getting many new players so no dire need for more POPI...


[10-Nov-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	both SSTs upkeep are more than sufficient


[10-Nov-21 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Then that would make more sense.  The spreadsheet you provided says they are giving a combined 3333 safety and that equates to 49.3% fullfillment.  If  we calculate using 5000 safety then fullfilment is 57% which is much closer to what this POPR says.


[10-Nov-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Aahhh I've been reading it wrong. Upkeeps supplied isn't how many stations we kept up


[10-Nov-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	cell J4 (Upkeeps supplied) had the wrong number entered.


[10-Nov-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But how many materials we stuck into it


[10-Nov-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup, just changed it


[10-Nov-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol we haven't had to turn any of these on yet on Outer Heaven


[10-Nov-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Anyways, True Happiness still at 65%


[10-Nov-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	My understanding is we don't get new PIO's unless actual Happiness is 70%+ and we loose them if it's 50%-


[10-Nov-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'm planning to put a few more people to work soon.  Also putting up a Tech building so maybe we'll get a little technician education.


[10-Nov-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And that True Happiness will guide Actual Happiness over a 5 week averaging


[10-Nov-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think I read that happiness is based on the last 4 weeks but weighted toward the most recent week.


[10-Nov-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	True Happiness guides it, that I have seen on Saladin


[10-Nov-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But the exact formula and the weighting I'm not 100% clear on


[10-Nov-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Either way, it's not a red flag, but definitely a yellow one.


[11-Nov-21 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Didn't know we were playing football...


[11-Nov-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hmm, I suppose one way to ensure upkeep was met in a more evenly distributed way would be to get an ADM, but I imagine for a lot of people Verdant appeals because there are no fees


[11-Nov-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but happiness is going to be an issue if we want to continue to grow Verdant


[11-Nov-21 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and if people are wanting to tech up, also would be an issue


[11-Nov-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	maybe we make a Poll if we want a adm if someone wants to take the Rolex


[11-Nov-21 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	*Role as govern


[11-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	because building an adm is easy a competent govern who wants to do it is harder


[11-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if people want an adm


[11-Nov-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You could use a more survey oriented tool... that would allow folks to enter their usernames along with their vote


[11-Nov-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yes i thougth about it but than i would have to go through the user list and verfiy it


[11-Nov-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and people can just go the list themself and enter the name


[11-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**VicodinTaco**:	if you are paying taxes it means you are making money!!


[11-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Some in my corp disagree, but frankly I think it's only a matter of time before it's just better that somebody watches over Verdant's growth. And honestly I think I'd pay less in taxes than I do in voluntary donations.


[11-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the necessity of it isnt immediate... thats one of the ways i could disagree with it and yea for donating stuff the value adds up


[11-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	neither totally 100% agree or disagreeing here for me... but leaning more towards yes for the ADM than no


[11-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	wait how much is the cost of one again? i know i asked a bunch of times already but totally forgot again :p


[11-Nov-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	how much for the ADM?


[11-Nov-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea


[11-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	unsure, it's a pile of lfabs and then the BMF/BWS is a little harder to source


[11-Nov-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	although probably not as difficult anymore


[11-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i think a long time ago? some1 quoted ~500k but not really sure about the price of one now since i have no idea how the prices of stuff have changed


[11-Nov-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that seems like at least a basic estimate to go off of


[11-Nov-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Jdawgie**:	when I purchase something off of the exchange where does it go


[12-Nov-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	it depends, if you have a warehouse it goes there


[12-Nov-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	it becomes a pick-up contract, open CONT at the left


[12-Nov-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Nov-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	but most likely if you just started, what IDK said, it'll be in a contract, that you have to fulfil by picking up the goods either with a ship or a warehouse


[12-Nov-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	yes, sorry, a ship landed on the station, not in orbit

[12-Nov-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	Question,  starting out as a carbon farmer.. does it make more sense to invest in h2o production or to build more incinerators?


[12-Nov-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	More incinerators


[12-Nov-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Burn them on the slowest setting for maximum value.


[12-Nov-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The faster settings get your more Carbon, but they're much less efficient so the internal cost of that carbon is a lot higher


[12-Nov-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	For sure! Thanks for the tips


[12-Nov-21 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Actually the faster C options have the best ROI... it's all I run


[12-Nov-21 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If you can afford to feed them, sure. But when you're just starting out supply bottlenecks favor more incinerators that have larger margins.


[13-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That makes sense


[13-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah my INC's are all on Vallis


[13-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Feeding them is... interesting


[13-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think every time I did the math either the slowest or the middle recipe comes out best


[13-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Though that's including growing the burnables on site


[13-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, that or somewhere you care about the area


[13-Nov-21 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	Any tips for improving company level? I see orders that I would ship but I can’t accept them


[13-Nov-21 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	I’m going the long burn on everything as suggested and saving up for another incinerator


[13-Nov-21 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	hey jdawgie, I PMd you about shipping contracts


[13-Nov-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	but to improve your rating, you just need to wait a week or two, currently you're on P which means your rating is pending


[13-Nov-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Texx**:	Question for some of the experienced farmer on this agricultural planet: What are some of the more profitable agricultural production routes in the future? Coffee? Cotton?


[14-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I just phased out my COF production in favor of burnables


[14-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	HCP/GRN/MAI in a 2/1/1 Ratio


[14-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Does it make sense to produce MAI in Hydro-Farm? Seems to me like the NS costs outweigh the 2x speed from just producing the MAI in a Farmstead


[14-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Same with HCP i guess too


[14-Nov-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	although thats 2.5x faster and cost half the NS


[14-Nov-21 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I think some people do... it may have been the GRN or something like that but I can't remember. HYF's have a significant cost associated with them, I just use FRM's


[14-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Are there any products that HYF's produce that are worth the extra upkeep from settler consumables?


[14-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So I just checked in with Pruner, and basically from an ROI perspective the HYF is not worth it


[14-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It can, however, produce certain goods faster


[14-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So if the agri product itself is not your goal, but perhaps a lucrative downstream product, it may be worth running the HYF's with their faster speed


[14-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It becomes a compound ROI calculation at that point


[14-Nov-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Pruner is a tool you can download. It and others are found here https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/community-resources/

[14-Nov-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Will supply of NS ever increase, thus decreasing it's price and making the ROI of HYF productions worth it?


[14-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Maybe... I think the issue with NS is it's made from LST which is heavy


[14-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	NS itself is also not light, so shipping it to Verdant may not be desirable


[14-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And that's the whole point of the HYF... you don't need a fertile planet to run them


[14-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's better to run them close to the source, a place where there's LST and it isn't too hard to ship in tons of water


[14-Nov-21 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I know some of my corp mates got into NS in a big way recently. Hard to say what the broader market will do.


[14-Nov-21 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The HYF is better when you're maximizing the production of the base rather than worrying about ROI


[14-Nov-21 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I bring the N and LST here since the ship would be empty on the way in except for a few consumables


[14-Nov-21 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The big thing is each HYF produces more than each FRM but uses half the space


[14-Nov-21 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I run 3 of them here to power 8 FPs


[14-Nov-21 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The biggest issue with HYFs is the insane water consumption


[14-Nov-21 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I guess if your base is maxed to the max permit the only way to expand further is the HYF


[14-Nov-21 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's really hard to run them on non-water worlds


[14-Nov-21 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And it's also weird because real-world HYFs use less water


[14-Nov-21 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah and Verdant is good in that shipping to Verdant is almost free


[14-Nov-21 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I guess you make COF here?


[14-Nov-21 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**AngryK1tten**:	I’ve got some relatively cheap OFF on the LM for donations. Also have some SUN. The safety stations are well stocked, so no particular rush. I’m just making sure inventory is available on planet (I donate some as my contribution).

**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm...


[14-Nov-21 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	how much would it cost to build a HQ?


[14-Nov-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	we estimated it would cost about 1.5 million


[15-Nov-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah, so you could build a Corp HQ there


[15-Nov-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	nope


[15-Nov-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Someone needs to build up a planet with a uni somewhere where a corp HQ could be built


[15-Nov-21 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Or I guess 10% to Verdant production wouldn't be awful


[15-Nov-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Cheaper consumables usually bodes well for the rest of the supply chain


[15-Nov-21 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's just looking at my spreadsheet Verdant is such as small piece of my overall profit


[15-Nov-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Less than 10% :(


[15-Nov-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course Montem and Vallis are out, so that's already over half my profit right there


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	okay the current result from the poll is that from a mire than 100 people 26 voted and a light majority wants a government but i feel that this is not enough to justify it because so many people didnt bote

**Hydroa**:	If you can afford it, you can build it


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	there is no ingame vote but for example if people are possed that you build a government against their wish they can just perma elect someone who Sets the Taxes to 0

***Nocknuck** deleted this message.*


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nocknuck**:	pissed not possed


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	that way everybody gets in game option to cast their vote


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	my Interpretation of the vote is that currently there is no strong desire for it


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and i dont want to waste a ton of money on it then


[16-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	alright


[16-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I didn't vote because I'm ambivalent on the issue (Build ADM, start Govt).  I agree with Nock: no strong desire yet, so let's wait.


[16-Nov-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Maybe we wait for someone who really wants it to step up & take the lead, make a strong case, put up some Fabs, and show that they could be a good Governor.


[16-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah what my Problem with that is if like 80% dont want taxes they can just vote in a govern that make 0 tax and we wasted a good Person


[16-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i would want a sizeable majority before i would recommand someone doing it


[16-Nov-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I agree.


[16-Nov-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	But often, one highly motivated good communicator can create a "sizeable majority" from an ambivalent mob.


[16-Nov-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	oh yeah that  could be the case


[16-Nov-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I wonder what folks hate more... taxes or warehouse and LM fees? Personally I'd like no LM/WAR fees. Taxes, the bare minimum to keep POPI running, I could live with


[16-Nov-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Cause... if you "don't like" taxes... well you do like POPI so you're kind of just freeloading at that point.

**Jdawgie**:	Hey there! how do I go about getting another ship? is it a hard process


[16-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yes


[16-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	the price for a ship without ftl engine is like 500k


[16-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and its "impossible" to build without a corp on your own


[16-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	basically sometimes people will throw down an ad for a ship in general chat or discord


[16-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	How much would you want for a one time batch of 200?


[17-Nov-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Did you get a loan to ramp up your base?  700 PG p/d would require 5 POL.


[17-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...Or did you mean PE instead of PG?


[17-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	one BMP can produce about 700 PE per day.


[17-Nov-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	I meant 600 PG per day and rounded to what should have been ABOUT 2000** PG p/d

[17-Nov-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Is it really that bad if he's a supporter on both accounts? I know that's kinda like pay to win, but there should be a limit to how many accounts someone can run so you can't have people spend $50k to win like I've come across in other games.


[22-Nov-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	there is a limit. 1


[22-Nov-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Yea... the limit is one


[22-Nov-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	I'm saying a physical limit


[22-Nov-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	You can't run 100 companies on your own


[22-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	And if you did, I'd respect the effort in itself!


[22-Nov-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	I also don't think alts are good and Arto should probably delete one of them, but if someone is going to pay for two accounts, I think for a small game like this, he's doing a good thing

[30-Nov-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	tyty... i can prob bring half the MCG required in 1.5days if no one else is arriving earlier with the full 600u needed


[30-Nov-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	my MCG production is small atm so cant provide the full 600 by myself for the upkeep


[30-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I might be able to help with that more down the road, but for now can't get there in time for when it'll be needed


[30-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	working on ramping up my MCG production to about 1300/day shortly


[30-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	not here, though, would have to ship it in


[30-Nov-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	same... looking at montem for base 3...? not confirmed but mostly likely


[30-Nov-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but thats still at least 2 weeks away for me


[30-Nov-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	is that 600 MCG every cycle?


[30-Nov-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	every 10 days ye... probs will increase with more players joining


[30-Nov-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so a shipload of MCG would last about 30 days right now


[30-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	mhm


[30-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**IDKanything**:	7BBH 15BDE 20TRU


[30-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and that would unlock more spots?


[30-Nov-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but we've been through that already lol


[30-Nov-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I realize it's a risk when posting shipping orders - but I it really annoys me when the person grabs a contract and sits on it for days, tying up my inventory space.


[30-Nov-21 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I wish we could specify the length of each shipping contract stage separately


[30-Nov-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Yeah or cancel altogether


[30-Nov-21 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I always try to pay right away... that may not be the best strategy.


[30-Nov-21 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	some1 picked up my 2d MOR>HRT shipping contract like <20mins after i posted... picked up when the timer was at 8hrs


[30-Nov-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	picked up the package*


[30-Nov-21 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Mine's a 4-day delivery. It's been sitting blocked in my inventory for 1 1/2 days now.


[30-Nov-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Clearly it must be due to the global shipping container shortage due to Covid. smh


[30-Nov-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I need to get those GRN delivered in time so I can bake up some nice fruitcake for my PIO for Christmas. Santa will not be pleased.


[30-Nov-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I have some Grain on Montem if that's where you need it


[30-Nov-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Thanks - I'll manage. The PIO will have to suffer a little this year.


[30-Nov-21 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	poor elves


[30-Nov-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yall bringing the tech happiness up from a flat 0% :D finally that lonely techie all this while found some friends


[01-Dec-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I was hoping for more than 15 educated this week.  Anything we can do to raise that number next week?


[01-Dec-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If we get another 200 we might be able to generate an engineer  :)


[01-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	prob just keeping jobs open and raising that happiness... not having an ADM = not being able to raise funds for more POPI = cant help grow populations using POPI... unless more people contribute which is hhhhh


[01-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	Ill be able to contribute to this stuff soon enough! shwippity has been helping me get ramped up


[01-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yo @CaptainIncognito have u shipped those LSTs out yet?


[01-Dec-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I have an ELP, I think I'm going to make the BMF for the ADM. My money's going towards ending this unbalanced contribution game.


[01-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i make nothing required other than MCG so imma throw in the 750u needed in ~10days or so plus 50k cash in a week


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If there were a government here about how much would each base be paying in taxes per week?


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	by my calculations rates wld be 10-11ncc/building per day is enough for upkeep


[01-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	including the upkeep for the 3rd SST that we need but dont have rn


[01-Dec-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I have 17 buildings.  Does that mean I should be contributing 500ncc/wk?


[01-Dec-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	darn stupid calculator.   can't do simple math.  I mean 1190ncc


[01-Dec-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ye


[01-Dec-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if my knowledge of taxes is correct


[01-Dec-21 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That is perfectly reasonable.   I had started contributing but then threw all my spare cash into getting base #3 up.  I should be able to start contributing regularly now.


[01-Dec-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yey :D


[01-Dec-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	There.  I contributed the maximum possible... 36DW


[01-Dec-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we still need an ADM tho... so that our upkeep is more secured if that makes sense... plus get people to contribute through taxes more evenly


[01-Dec-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	For the safety station upgrade does that mean upgrading the existing two or does it mean upgrading to three SSs?


[01-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the upgrade increases the number of SSTs


[01-Dec-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I would contribute some bfabs but I'm a bit behind schedule with those.  I had planned to put a PP1 on base #3.  I put everything I need on the ship and sent it off.  Then realized I need limestone too.  .


[01-Dec-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	oof... well i plan to make bfabs but thats still like 2-4weeks away depending on the pio growth on my base 2


[02-Dec-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	One ORC will only be enough for 333.33 scientists per day


[02-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Haven't looked into it that much - that's a massive difference between techs and SCI then.


[02-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh, I guess it also makes PIB for VG


[02-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Though how many months would it be before we got to 333 SCI...


[02-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, it will be awhile


[02-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I think the numbers on PIB are way worse - one batch of 10 PIB makes 50 VIT, which makes 500 VG... and 100 engis use 0.2 VG per day


[02-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[02-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also the IVP


[02-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	So 1 ORC makes enough PIB for... over 250,000 engis per day?


[02-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess that one makes sense once you have scientists?


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	yeah, that looks right


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	man 333.33 vs 250k


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, after SCI become plentiful we'll need a bunch more ORCs - I may convert the rest of my FRM's into ORC by then


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might scrap my hyf/fp setup


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Though i expect HOP will still be used more considering how many techs there will be in the universe


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	RATs and DW prices are pretty stable


[02-Dec-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[02-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My CLF was overproducing and on its way to being torn down


[02-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	until it wasn't


[02-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and had to be repaired


[02-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the existing supply jacked up in price and released slowly to avoid selling out


[02-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At some point I was selling at 500 and someone bought out 50+ units


[02-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	What's funny is that our CLF in corp are also barely able to keep up with demand for Techs, so we're building more soon - and then my ORC here is now at 54% building condition (also no techs) and still vastly overproducing for our needs lol


[02-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So I raised my price to 600 and released my remaining 100 HMS only to have those sell out in a day or two


[02-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So now I'm posting them at 750 in batches of 10-20 as they get produced

**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean when I built the CLF the first few weeks I sold for 1k


[02-Dec-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah


[02-Dec-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	even at 500 it was profitable


[02-Dec-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	just on the edge of wanting to be rid of it to simplify my logistics


[02-Dec-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Kind of hard to judge the profit since there really isn't an IND market


[02-Dec-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	haha yeah that's the problem with all high tier stuff isn't it :)  The universe slowly catches up though, maybe eventually even A-Fabs will be commonly sold on the CX :P


[02-Dec-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	There was a discussion about electing a governor and setting small taxes to keep workforce happy.


[04-Dec-21 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Can we elect one to prevent problems with population? I'd like to keep 0 fees for LM and warehouse, because it would encourage people from other planets to come and trade here.


[04-Dec-21 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	We have to build a 3rd Safety Station.  Half of the resources have been contributed.   We need people to contribute some more BBHs and BDEs.


[04-Dec-21 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Yeah, those could and I believe should be bought from collected taxes. I'm building my base and it will take a while before I will be able to start contributing bfabs or other construction materials. Right now I can give only some DW.


[04-Dec-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Every  little bit helps.  Speaking of which, if every base on the planet gave a little bit we'd be in good shape


[04-Dec-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Of course. It's just that I'm ok with taxes and electing a governor to deal with public infrastructure so that people could grow big and pay even more taxes. ;)

[07-Dec-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I mean this is kinda a farming planet


[07-Dec-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	its like perfect for that


[07-Dec-21 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Unless ur saying ur gonna be needing over 200 more techs every week, wouldn't the population of techies just grow overtime with open jobs? I mean ur trying to bring up the happiness from a flat zero it will take at least another POPR or two even if we build an INF... no?


[07-Dec-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	We had just 1 tech for the longest time.  Then I put up a tech building and the next week two more people did the same.  So I figured maybe people were just holding back because there weren't any techs to employ and there actually is some interest in having more of those workers.  After all, ORC and IVP are agriculture/food productions.


[07-Dec-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not sure if i used the population calculator spreadsheet properly, but i tried to run some numbers and saw only a difference in increase of 2-4 per POPR with and INF compared to without


[07-Dec-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Technicians need health, safety and comfort.  I suggested an INF because it is a lot cheaper than some of the other things like a Wellness Center.


[07-Dec-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Does that spreadsheet calculate migration, education or both?


[07-Dec-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if we start getting an increased need for settlers because we have like 1.6k unemployed looking at last popr, then sure build an INF... but if not then our next POPI building would probably be another SST


[07-Dec-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	im using the one from the community resources... if that helps idk


[07-Dec-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hydroa**:	Hey, I need to convert some NCC to CIS, but I don't have pro. Would someone be willing to do some LM buys/sales for 1 h2o whereby I end up giving you 20kNCC and you end up giving me 19kCIS. You should note the 5% profit in it for your time.


[08-Dec-21 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	so now that new SST is build, will this POPR bring more PIO or does it take one more week?


[08-Dec-21 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	It will "activate" this POPR and bring in more pios i think?


[08-Dec-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It doesn't kick in until the first consumption tick, and even then it only kicks in for a percentage of days that it was active. So if 1 of 3 upkeeps are applied for 3/7 days, then we get 3/21 of the safety.


[08-Dec-21 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The preexisting safety stations will keep working, if we just built a new one it's unlikely to take affect right away.


[08-Dec-21 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	so this popr will only be a fraction of the 3rd SST?


[08-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Hoping we get more pioneers, I'm missing about 550 atm


[08-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we will get more pioneers... the question is if the amount is enough to fill all the open jobs we're having rn cos that number isn't small, a lot more players dropping buildings this week


[08-Dec-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The stafety station was built 3 days ago, and consumption happened 1d13h ago with the popr in 9 hours. So we'll get 1d22h of benefit out of this last safety station, which is 27% of the potential value of the safet station.


[08-Dec-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If my math is right.


[08-Dec-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	That's only 685 Safety


[08-Dec-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Or 2740 Pioneers made safe


[08-Dec-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	so not a lot


[08-Dec-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Especially considering that with 2 safety stations fully opperational we were at 57.5% last report? This shouldn't make much of a dent at all. It'll help a bit for the next one.


[08-Dec-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Thaillon** joined.*


[08-Dec-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It should bring our safety to ~60.6%


[08-Dec-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If there are new bases, it'll go up a bit, if players with big bases add more jobs, it'll go down a bit


[08-Dec-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	We'd need 5.7 safety stations at full power to get 100% safety


[08-Dec-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	and 2.25 infirmirtys at full power to get 100% health


[08-Dec-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I don't think we need full health and safety though


[08-Dec-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	*infirmaries


[08-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Does upkeep go up with the number of safety stations?  i.e. do two SSs need twice as much upkeep as one?


[08-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	yup


[08-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	And each SST costs something like 20% more than the last to build. So it gets exponentially more expensive to make, but the upkeep is linear


[08-Dec-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I dont really care which one is built, but it is good to note that infirmaries require test tubes, which are produced in a glass furnace using glass, which may be hard to come by on verdant


[08-Dec-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I don't think INF boost Pioneers at all, which is the urgent need here


[08-Dec-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	There are agrarian building that use technicians.  An INF would be helpful with that.  Test tubes are available at the CX or I'm sure one of us could bring some from another base.


[08-Dec-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	my point is that upkeep is easier for safety stations because almost anyone can produce them with the equipment people would have anyway


[08-Dec-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	very few people here will have glass blowers

[08-Dec-21 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	to me not worth to build something not urgent and decrease efficiency but is based on situation and personal opinion


[08-Dec-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The extra supply upkeep is the killer


[08-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	But if you've got 2x as many buildings but they're at 50% efficiency, then you're still producing the same amount of stuff. It's still X workers worth of stuff.

[08-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	unless ur a big player with a decent amount to spare


[09-Dec-21 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**deathmetalphilosophy**:	Love waking up to a nice fresh pop report


[09-Dec-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	well, my vacancies got filled, but still there are almost 2,5k open jobs. It's weird to lack pios.


[09-Dec-21 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think open jobs number is the jobs available when the POPR came out which have now been filled by the new migration.


[09-Dec-21 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If there were still open jobs then some of your vacancies would not have been filled.  I think the way to read this is: change (3015) minus open jobs (2437) = 578 pioneers currently unemployed.


[09-Dec-21 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	ok, that's better.


[09-Dec-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	However current workforce shows 590(0). I guess, it means that if I build something, those jobs wont' be filled.


[09-Dec-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Click on construct and look at the pioneer buildings.  Next to workforce it will have two numbers, one in parentheses.  For example, you might see for a BMP - Pioneers 100 (58).  The first number is how many pioneers are required for the building and the second number is how many you will get from the current population pool.


[09-Dec-21 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Thanks. Yeah, there are some people allocated, not as many as I'd wish though.


[09-Dec-21 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	My Montem base shows 1220 pios available. I'll expand there for a while.


[09-Dec-21 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	there will likely be more next week (unless a lot of new buildings get constructed).  You just need to decide if it is better to wait or if the new building is worth having less than 100% of the jobs filled.


[09-Dec-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Hopefully, I'll be able to contribute to POPI a bit more soon.


[09-Dec-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Not worth it for me. Last week I had my production running at 80 something %.


[09-Dec-21 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Keep in mind, the new workers don't simply go to the new building.  They are added to your current workforce which is distributed evenly among all of your buildings.


[09-Dec-21 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Production times were long, I didn't like it.

**CapitanIncognito**:	Posted a shipping ad for 4k if anyone is going to MOR


[10-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yesterday there were 43 shipping contract from verdant


[10-Dec-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	there is some backlog


[10-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	there's definitely money to be made shipping from Verdant back to the MOR area


[10-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	problem is so many of the bases here need to ship a lot of stuff that way anyway so they do their own stuff instead of the ads


[10-Dec-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	This universe needs more FTL ships


[10-Dec-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	maybe now that the first SCI has shown up we will work towards that


[10-Dec-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Tbh, i do shipping occasionally from verdant, its just that pay is usually too low to bother (sometimes it doesnt even cover fuel costs)


[10-Dec-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I've felt across the board like shipping prices are low this universe, but I suppose true value of the shipping is whatever people will accept and do it for


[10-Dec-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	looks at more than 50% ship contract for 2/t


[10-Dec-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	hot take unless your name is spice most shipping contracts are for ripping off new pro players


[10-Dec-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Looks like the shipping fees offered are pushing up to about 15-16NCC/unit, some as high as 20NCC/unit. But fuel costs have been on the rise too.


[10-Dec-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	yeah i've had some really small loadz up this week for 12/u and they expired


[10-Dec-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ad up for small shipment from MOR cx back to Verdant paying 40ncc/max for 2 day delivery


[11-Dec-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	I could grab it for you if you want. I am having a ship dock at Moria in 50 mins


[11-Dec-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Ooo sure tysm


[11-Dec-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Hey Verdant Peoples


[11-Dec-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Would y'all be interesed in me popping down an ADM and being gov? so that upkeep and any popi expansion can be sorted easily


[11-Dec-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	It would introduce taxs but I'll keep them as small as possible. Probably will bring INF and SST too


[11-Dec-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If you dont want it than I wont do it. I get it if you want to keep verdant a tax haven lol


[11-Dec-21 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Forseral**:	Verdant does not use NCC for its taxes, so I'd have to close up shop immediately.


[11-Dec-21 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	It uses currency of whatever the governors currency is. Pyrgos is an example of this. It is outside faction space and the other planets in that system show ICA in the LR screen but it uses CIS


[12-Dec-21 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Ah, another person wanting to be a governor, Personally still not interested


[12-Dec-21 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-21 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	What currency will Verdant have if we have ADM?


[12-Dec-21 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The best currency: beans.


[12-Dec-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	We all eat beans down here


[12-Dec-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	The beans must flow


[12-Dec-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	Tho in all seriousness it would be NCC as it is a starter planet where you start with NCC


[12-Dec-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah I am fairly sure that currency changeing will not be an option here.


[12-Dec-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If anyone has no NCC I can just buy some of your production in NCC


[12-Dec-21 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Did no one even read what I wrote above? lol


[12-Dec-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	how much do you need?


[13-Dec-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	200 would hold me over for a bit!


[13-Dec-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I posted some new buys you can grab


[13-Dec-21 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or if you want to post for 200 at 45/u I can grab it


[13-Dec-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	much appreciated!


[13-Dec-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	just picked them up


[13-Dec-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	There we go guys, finished up the SST and built a INF


[13-Dec-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The ADM mats will arrive in 26h, from what I can tell is that more people are in favor than against. If anyone doesn't want an ADM please add your point of view


[13-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Build it!


[13-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	But if taxes are unreasonable... -_-


[13-Dec-21 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	sorry new farmer here, what does an ADM do for us?


[13-Dec-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	you said something about the government being responsible for building upkeep?


[13-Dec-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	:D


[13-Dec-21 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	so right now only a handful of players are contributing to the upkeep of POPI and COGC, while most players dont and just reap the benefits


[13-Dec-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	taxes set by a governor ensure that everyone pays a smaller more fair amount instead of a few paying large amounts to pay for upkeep, and makes upkeep more secured in the sense that it is not reliant on "donations"


[13-Dec-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	taxes are very very small compared to the profits of any products anyways


[13-Dec-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Who's gonna build the Admin Center though?


[13-Dec-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@Spice


[13-Dec-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	oh so it becomes a collective responsibility


[13-Dec-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	neat


[13-Dec-21 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	since good person Spice does not have a contender for government, it seems to be a simple vote


[13-Dec-21 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	aye aye


[13-Dec-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	In my eyes, i prefer not having a government. While having a fair amount of taxes paid by everyone is not a bad thing, i know of few things preventing a person from abusing their position *if they get away with it*. Compound this with the fact that since verdant is a while away from CX, along with the decreased amount of goods, Liquid assets are harder to come by for people who do not have multiple bases. As its a farming planet, its much easier to dedicate a bit of your production instead of paying money on every little thing you do. Personally, i think this can be dealt with by basically advertising when something needs contributions, as well as encouraging donations, no matter how small. Myself, if i see something is lacking i contribute what i can (though i only recently got enough production to allow it)


[13-Dec-21 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@Spice says they're willing to buy the products you make if you dont have enough for taxes


[13-Dec-21 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	While there will be some people who do not contribute, they will be either too small to contribute, which they should be allowed to grow, or simply greedy, and those types of people are (generally) the minority.


[13-Dec-21 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	And have the market decided by the governent?


[13-Dec-21 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	a lot of the big players just focus on their other bases instead tho, so a decent lot is not contributing


[13-Dec-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	market as in prices? RAT, DW, H2O prices on the LM are pretty stagnant so around that price


[13-Dec-21 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	wait nvm all the normal ads are gone... RAT 45-50/u DW 30-35/u


[13-Dec-21 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Yea it still moves


[13-Dec-21 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	which isnt that diff from the cx


[13-Dec-21 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	accounting for shipping and all it isnt bad


[13-Dec-21 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	The shipping isnt terrible in terms of cost overhead, at least one way, but consider the fact that there is nothing bringing ships back without a loss


[13-Dec-21 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	The return trip is what really kills any profitability of shipping from verdant


[13-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	expecially with the fuel prices nowadays


[13-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	thats why trial players dont fly often, but even so just keeping a thousand or so for taxes is enough to last until the next time you're planning to fly


[13-Dec-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if you have pro/basic then just do shipping contracts that are worth the pay


[13-Dec-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	You can only ship so much at a time, and especially if people arent paying too much attention it might not be worth it to go through the effort of bringing 500 DW to the CX


[13-Dec-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I know that, and i do, but the point is that on verdant, Liquid assets are much rarer than solid assets.


[13-Dec-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Due to the distance and shipping situation


[13-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	a government makes sense on montem, because its the same system as the cx


[13-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	its right there


[13-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	hardly any fuel usage


[13-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	and almost no time


[13-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and with solid assets most people rather just use them themselves -_-


[13-Dec-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	How would someone use it themselves, as long as they are producing more than they consume, itll all just sit in warehouse


[13-Dec-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	For a long time, i didnt even know the contributions existed


[13-Dec-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	most of what we need isnt even made on verdant


[13-Dec-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Besides MCG, what is used for upkeep that cant be made here


[13-Dec-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Then again, now that i think about it, having upkeep that requires importing can solve that whole one-way issue woth shipping.


[13-Dec-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	STR OFF TUB... SUN is troublesome too because of the C it needs


[13-Dec-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	PE requires H which isnt cheap


[13-Dec-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	oh we have an infirmary


[13-Dec-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	didnt notice that


[13-Dec-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Well i agree, upkeeping an infirmary is rather difficult for verdant


[13-Dec-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Though it looks like Holo's handling it since they built it by themselves


[13-Dec-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	taxes wont be that high anyways idk why ur so adamant on not having it entirely


[13-Dec-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ye thats @Spice... they're also bringing the mats for the ADM


[13-Dec-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	They wont be that high immediately


[13-Dec-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	but as more stuff is built, more tax will be needed to justify upkeep


[13-Dec-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not as much as montem which ur comparing against


[13-Dec-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we just need to sustain and grow what pop we need, not industrialise to the extreme


[13-Dec-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	yes, but if a governor wanted more technicians on verdant, for example, they can just build the onfrastructure then force the upkeep on everyone


[13-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	even though a vast majority of people use pioneers and *sometimes* settlers


[13-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	With the community contribution model, what the community needs is paid for by the community, nothing else


[13-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	people who want tech generally pay the stuff for tech themselves


[13-Dec-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and with that contribution model only 15% of the community is doing their part -_-


[13-Dec-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	wait no it is closer to 10%, you can count the people who contribute their fair share regularly apart from cogc upkeep but thats the same few people


[13-Dec-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	And i agree thats an issue, but its one that can be rectified by the community. We have a user list for this chat, we know who is on the planet.


[13-Dec-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	save that logistics hell and just have small taxes


[13-Dec-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	They are only small as long as the industrial machine does not start chugging along


[13-Dec-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	im a new player so i may be missing something, but this planet only has fertility, water, and oxygen


[13-Dec-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	so what industry is going to get kicked off here


[13-Dec-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	kicked off meaning...?


[13-Dec-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	kawaii saying the industrial machine starts chugging along


[13-Dec-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	what does that mean when this can basically only be a farming planet with pioneers and settlers


[13-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	So it is best off being a planet with pioneers and settlers, but that does not mean someone cannot make it something else.


[13-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	People have a limited number of bases they can make, and have a certain amount of space they can use.


[13-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	thrs agri buildings that uses techs even


[13-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	how long is a gov term, if they start doing something not in everyones interest can we boot them?


[13-Dec-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Im new too, so i wanna know this as well


[13-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@Spice is a player not in it for the money


[13-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	i dont really see spice being a bad gov based on what i have seen, it looks like they have already significantly invested in the planet


[13-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	and tbh, i believe that. Dont know em personally, but the business ive had with him has been good.


[13-Dec-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoGa**:	but if something did go weird it would be nice to know our options


[13-Dec-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I wouldnt be opposed to spice, specifically, being governor. But once the box of governing has been opened, it cannot be closed.


[13-Dec-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Trade logisitics for politics


[13-Dec-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	personally, i prefer the latter


[13-Dec-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I came to PRU for business MMO simulation, not democracy 4


[13-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the problem with the logistics strat is you cant do anything to those who dont contribute


[13-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Yes you can


[13-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	which makes those who do need to contribute more


[13-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	what can you do -_-


[13-Dec-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	If they use the LM, refuse to deal with them


[13-Dec-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	that doesnt affect them in playing


[13-Dec-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	though thats a harsh measure


[13-Dec-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and trial players you cant do anything


[13-Dec-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	they dont contribute you cant make them


[13-Dec-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Is that down to them rigidly refusing to contribute, or either not seeing it as an important issue, or not even knowing it at all?


[13-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we have advertised contributing many times before


[13-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	no change in who contributes at all


[13-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Alright then


[13-Dec-21 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Then again, you are also failing to take into account that the same people who don't contribute to infrastructure will probably still have a vote in the new system. Making them just as annoying but for a different reason.


[13-Dec-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	majority will be in favor, if some1 else is elected then let them handle the ~15k/day upkeep costs (estimated number might be more)


[13-Dec-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	also thats why we need to vote for some1 that is experienced and not in it for the money


[13-Dec-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Yes, but do you trust everyone to do that


[13-Dec-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	and to continue doing that in the future


[13-Dec-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	My point is that if Verdant gets a government, and it is managed by a good governor the entire time there is no issue. But, if anyone along the line wants to be greedy, there are many ways that a large number prople on verdant can be burdened for no benefit to themselves.


[13-Dec-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Meh Spice is alright. And if someone is greedy the same mechanism that got them into office can take them out


[13-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	"many ways that a large number prople on verdant can be burdened for no benefit to themselves"... a small number of people are being burdened by a lot with the contribution strat rn


[13-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	^


[13-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	And either way, if unnesseary infrastructure is minimized there is no issue, its just that under a taxed system its really easy go get away with making people who only use pioneers pay for the stuff used by technicians+ workers.


[13-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	*to get away


[13-Dec-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	thus an inverse issue, the many paying for the few


[13-Dec-21 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the tech+ stuff can be paid by those who use them not by all


[13-Dec-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Is that an option?


[13-Dec-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	This will be a suprise, but i havent been a governor before


[13-Dec-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	those who use tech popi can just contribute the mats themselves and have those popi not be under the responsibility of the gov


[13-Dec-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Whats to stop someone from deciding that taxpayers should pay for tech upkeep?


[13-Dec-21 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	that goes back to deciding whos gov... which is already settled


[13-Dec-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	For now it is, a few election cycles down the line who knows? Anyway, will people be able to see what tax is being spent on?


[13-Dec-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	or is it black box?


[13-Dec-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	eh whatever, i made the points i needed to and its late, anything else is just semantics.

**Hydroa**:	@idkanything The popi records don't go that far back. I've contributed large quantities of DW / RAT for many months, and made cash donations to people who were building infrastrucure. I've fallen off in the last few months because I felt like my early contributions went above and beyond.


[14-Dec-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Spice**:	I mean sure If I become Gov ( could raise taxes and steal a bunch of money but 1: it would immediatly get caught and no one would vote for me and 2: I really dont need more money, thats why im building an ADM in the first place. Something to spend money on before ftl ships arrive


[14-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Ill leave taxes at default? if their is one. if its more than we need i drop taxes, if its less than we need ill just keep it the same


[14-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If their is a default I wont increase it unless its WAY below whats needed


[14-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Someone told me the default will be 0 taxs lol, better to start low and go up? it will be alot faster to start at 20? and than drop it by however much % is excess


[14-Dec-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	Vote for me I will have a VERY HIGH tax rate.  It will be a very unorganized process and I have very little connections.


[14-Dec-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	But I believe in justice.


[14-Dec-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Sounds like a great plan, taxs allegedly can be set to 9999. why not do 1 session of that and than no taxes forever


[14-Dec-21 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	yes I am thinking along those lines


[14-Dec-21 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Vicodin for Gov! Embezzling is fun!


[14-Dec-21 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	wonderful, 100% transparent government


[14-Dec-21 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Sigh... Not sure why there was even a discussion these past few days. Doesn't matter how many people objected. Now we have a government who will tax the many to benefit the few. Yay.


[14-Dec-21 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Upkeep costs can easily be covered by default with more to spare, but as we need more SSTs in the future the mats needed will increase with each upgrade so my take on taxes is to either keep it at default 20 and not change it overtime for a longer while until upkeep cannot be met with the taxes or start at 15? And increase it every few upgrades... or smth along those lines


[15-Dec-21 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	It will benifit the few by letting those who donate to have less stress on them from having to donate


[15-Dec-21 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	Running with a gov is the best option for Verdant


[15-Dec-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	97% of my base on Verdant is pioneers. You'll be taxing the production of those pioneers to fund Population Infrastructure for higher levels. That's what I mean by the many being taxed for the benefit of the few.


[15-Dec-21 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Who said anything about higher tiers?


[15-Dec-21 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	we only need SSTs and INFs no? since when are we doing more...


[15-Dec-21 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	correct


[15-Dec-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I don't know what happens to PIO population without SST and so on. Do PIO population levels decay? I always assumed you needed that stuff to attract settlers and up


[15-Dec-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	pioneers prioritise life support n safety, so we need SSTs... health is the next highest factor so we also need to have the occasional INF upgrade to keep health up


[15-Dec-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	SSTs and INFs are to keep our pioneer population up


[15-Dec-21 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if the pio happiness drops to <50 the pio population decreases by a ton, so we need keep happiness in v high 60 or above


[15-Dec-21 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	in between 50 and 60 we dont lose from migration but still lose from education to settlers which from the looks of it we dont use much


[15-Dec-21 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I see. Can't we just, you know, legalize weed or something?


[15-Dec-21 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	At current population, we need 4 fully opperational safety stations to function


[15-Dec-21 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I don't see any reason to do anything with techs and higher. Verdant doesn't need to be high tier thats for other planets to mess with


[15-Dec-21 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Less than that and we won't gain pioneers. If we don't gain them, we'll lose them as more people need them and they educate out.


[15-Dec-21 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	A SST could be used to increase our health, but wouldn't be *needed*


[15-Dec-21 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It'd help educate more settlers, and improve our pioneer's happiness a little


[15-Dec-21 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	by the looks of it, we don't need settlers


[15-Dec-21 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I already popped a SST and INF down, we can see after if more is needed. We don't really need more than 70% happiness with Pioneers unless there is a huge deficit for some reason


[15-Dec-21 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If we just have 4 SSTs and 0 INFs, eventually we'll lose settlers, and the INF will be needed after a while to keep the population from dropping too far.


[15-Dec-21 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	@Spice, as long as people keep arriving on Verdant, we'll need >70% pio happiness otherwise the open jobs will build up


[15-Dec-21 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Not a lot higher, but a little


[15-Dec-21 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	75% is probably enough


[15-Dec-21 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	That's 5% pioneer growth -> 4277 more less settlers.


[15-Dec-21 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Might get away with 73%


[15-Dec-21 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	Can we go for some techs tho at some point? Running orchards here would be nice


[15-Dec-21 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	number of techs needed wont be high plus each ORC only needs 10 techs so no need for tech popi imo


[15-Dec-21 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if you want to build tech popi my take on it is those who want techs to build and provide the upkeep for those themselves


[15-Dec-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	On the way of getting pioneer buildings sorted I imagine the small amount of techs needed will increase by themselves


[15-Dec-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	But thats a good idea! I want to see tax revenue before making any decisions though (and likely wont do tech stuff as 99% of the people wont want it)


[15-Dec-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	even in the long run my plan for my base on verdant is kinda like 100% pioneers so im all for taxes because it rids me from needing to burn 20k a week while others dont contribute at all but not for it to be used for much higher tier stuff


[15-Dec-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	probably more like 95% of people don't want tech.  But then again, maybe once there are actually some free technicians available more people might decide they want an ORC or IVP.


[15-Dec-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Taxes mean we stop freeloading on the agri CoGC, which is fair


[15-Dec-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Speaking of taxes - I notice that it says the fees are in ICA.  Is that set or will it change once the election is complete?


[15-Dec-21 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	It should swap to NCC once im elected


[15-Dec-21 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	non faction planets just show ICA without a gov


[15-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	oh, yeah, with techs I meant in long time when it can be justified


[15-Dec-21 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I'll work on the SST and INF first and we can see how it goes, should bring us some techs.


[15-Dec-21 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

I have had great dealing with others in the SNF on a player to player basis. I however, refuse to support withmy tax money anyone or anything that is connected as a whole to SNF. I am trying to be civil here, and my reasons for my position are my own, and not for public consumption.

[15-Dec-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	well then you do you, McGangsta, no one will force you to stay on Verdant, or in the game for that matter.  I do like how it is all "these are my views and I don't speak for GTU", but yet you put perceived actions of 1 person onto all of SNF.


[15-Dec-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	No, I clearly said that I have had great interactions with members of the SNF.  what I said is I cannot support the SNF or Smartdog as a whole

**McGangsta**:	I think what everyone here is failing to understand, is the this in not GTU, this is ME, me making a choice. I stand on the right of everyone in this game to play they way they want to play, if you want to be here, that is fine with me, if you want to pay the taxes, which are not a bad thing, and I am not opposed to, then fine play your game


[15-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	well you base your decision on entire "SNF" so I base my entire opinion of GTU on you


[15-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	seems fair to me


[15-Dec-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	Cool, well again, you do what you need to do.

[15-Dec-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	No, I base my decision on Smartdog


[15-Dec-21 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and again, I do not understand how players with no understanding of MY situation think they can speak from a position of authority....you need to be less concerned with me and deal with you


[15-Dec-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	What I don't get is why anyone cares what anyone else does.  Isn't the whole point of this game that we're big shot CEOs with vast resources and power at our beck and call?

[15-Dec-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and one more time, I want to mkae it understood, that this is a player choice, my choice and has nothing to do with the GTU Corp

**McGangsta**:	it really bothers you that some players will not just submit to your whims, doesn't it?...it seems that way


[15-Dec-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	how dare we have an opinion that is not the one issued


[15-Dec-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i know...that is why i have chose to leave, you really are a smart one, you catch on fast


[15-Dec-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If you want to leave verdant if i become gov than go ahead, do whatever you want in prun


[15-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	But I do promise that I am running as gov individually. No secret SNF plans or anything. I'm not a leader in SNF at all


[15-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	it is not you my friend, not you at all, please understand that


[15-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Oh I really mean it in a civil way


[15-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	me too


[15-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Its a game, do whatever you want and have fun :)


[15-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	indeed! :}


[15-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also if i do a poor job as gov, Archon1 or anyone else could easily take the job


[15-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If I do a REALLY bad gov than ill just resign


[15-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I am sure you will be great!, I want nothing different


[15-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Changing the subject, Would people like the idea of selling upkeep items to me on the lm


[15-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I can 100% easily handle it myself, but if you guys want I can buy the consumables off of you (In NCC) I'll probably pay above market in that case too.


[15-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	*and upkeep mats


[15-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Sounds like a good plan for everybody " rolls up the applecart


[15-Dec-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	As long as it's off the LM or the CX, and not the way Vallis does it with a complicated auction system that rewards players who play on Discord mostly


[15-Dec-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	buying off the LM allows for everyone to play, not just giving extra cash to the already powerful in-crowd


[15-Dec-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think supporting the upkeep as much as possible locally is a great idea


[15-Dec-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Willing to buy 4 spicy herbs at a ridiculous price or for some KOM etc, I kind of messed up and my Fermenter is going to be idle for a day otherwise

**VicodinTaco**:	at your service fine sir.


[15-Dec-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah I am a simple man


[15-Dec-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I literally do not understand the vallis system so I never bother with it


[15-Dec-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	Well, I don't understand how you are beating me in this election.  I can't believe how uniformed these ignorant, pathetic voters are.


[15-Dec-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	But you will have my support


[15-Dec-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I'll vote for you


[15-Dec-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	For the spicy herbs


[15-Dec-21 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	Thank you, they are stealing the election.  But in the end we must work together.


[15-Dec-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I voted for you


[15-Dec-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Maybe I should change my vote too


[15-Dec-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Hey, @McGanksta - I'm having computer problems, can't get on Discord.  If you have stuffs needs shipped back to Montem, please post the ads, usual terms.


[15-Dec-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	OPERATION EXODUS UPDATE: all production and HAB buildings will be dismantled in 24 hours, after that Shipping will be the main issue, I will still have a CM and WAR until I ship all off planet

**McGangsta**:	@kiri, in game DM me


[15-Dec-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Sorry to see you go, McG.


[15-Dec-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Are you leaving because you fear Spice will govern badly, or just because of his association with SNF?


[15-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(That's a sincere question, related to how I'll vote, not playing Gotcha_


[15-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	the short of it is, I cannot support the Corporate front of SNF, I ahve no issue with Spice


[15-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Its okay if people want to leave


[15-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	no reason in argueing or discussing it


[15-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Put your bases on whichever planets you want


[15-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I am sure Spice will make a fine leader if he is elected, as would anyone of the players running,


[15-Dec-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	off to lunch


[15-Dec-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Thx, McG.  Prolly see you elsewhere!


[15-Dec-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(Note: I'm technically in SNF, but I don't do Discord, so I'm only loosely connected)


[15-Dec-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	again, most of the SNF members are fine...most...lol


[15-Dec-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Ha, that - "most are fine" - could accurately describe (almost) ANY set of humans!


[15-Dec-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	yep


[15-Dec-21 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I feel like this is getting silly. I objected to the ADM on Verdant at first but I can see why it's needed. The tensions between SNF and GTU are making this a bigger deal than it should be, IMO. I suppose I don't know the whole history, though...


[15-Dec-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	IMO, the chat I've seen on this has been fine - civilized discussion, with nothing really nasty or personal.


[15-Dec-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	But I would like to see some real Campaigning before the vote is over!


[15-Dec-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	C'mon, who's gonna promise Free Ponies for Everybody?  And who will accuse their opponent of what unspeakable acts?


[15-Dec-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	ADM is absolutely needed; the voluntary contribution method was inevitably going to collapse, I've always been in support.  That said - there's history of person(s) in the SNF corporation being governor and utilizing tax revenue for personal/corporate purposes.  Not currently, but history.  And, you know "we're not doing that now" isn't always going to convince people to give another chance when they've been burned before.  I'll stipulate that Spice is a lovely upstanding person... but history is already written and affects us, sometimes.


[15-Dec-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Ah, now we're getting stuff which can be twisted into lurid headlines: "Kiriaster says Spice is Lovely!"


[15-Dec-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(on more serious note: are you talking History of This Pruniiverse or Prior?)


[15-Dec-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Does it matter?  :)


[15-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I'm speaking of history, and of persons who were in both universes.  Whether it happened in the prior universe or in this one is irrelevant to the outcome.


[15-Dec-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	OK.


[15-Dec-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	...and conversely there is history of some GTU members doing piracy. The actions of individual members shouldn't be assumed to be characteristic of the entire corporation. But we can't escape the tendency to do just that, I suppose.


[15-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	People are people, and in the aggregate they behave in people-ish ways.  :)


[15-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Is governor a paid position?  In other words, is it reasonable for the person to keep a portion of taxes collected in exchange for maintaining the planetary infrastructure?


[15-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Nothing in the game prevents them from keeping all the revenue. Except they probably won't get re-elected.


[15-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	True, but that's not what I asked.


[15-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Then I don't understand what you're asking


[15-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Ogre - all the taxes collected go directly to the Governor's corporation, divided equally among the members.  Most governors have a one-person corp.


[15-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	So, they get all the money.  Our hope is that they spend it on the planet - but they don't have to.


[15-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Is there a limit on how many buildings can one pop infrastrucutre have?


[15-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Right.   And as I understand it, the intent is for them to spend those taxes on the planet.  My question is if we should allow him to spend say 95% of those taxes and keep the rest as payment for managing things?


[15-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	*giggles at "we should allow"


[15-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Sure - but there is no way to enforce it


[15-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	i'll enforce it.  i believe in justice.


[15-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I am going to speedrun the upgrade scenario so I need to know the max amount of buildings that one can have


[15-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	"We" have no power to allow or disallow anything.  He gets  all the money, he decides what to do with it.  We can vote him out - but only at the next election.


[15-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	'allow' is the wrong word since he gets the money automatically.  I guess more precisely, should be expect it and not complain if the governor keeps some for himself.


[15-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	You can't even find out how much was gathered in tax revenue and what he spent it on, unless he tells you.  Good luck doing oversight on that.  :)


[15-Dec-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	If you have a good governor (Rubicate on Montem does a great job, imo, I don't know other ones) it's a good system.  If you have another type of governor... YMMV.


[15-Dec-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Spice aired the possibility of base owners to sell their MATs for NCC on planet LM that seems like the most frictionless and fair way to do it plus people dont have to dedicate shipping to earn cash to pay the taxes


[15-Dec-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Well, guess it's time for me to buy out the MM


[15-Dec-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	*upkeep mats


[15-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Point taken that we have no way of knowing if he is spending it honestly.  However, we also wouldn't know if he was spending it dishonestly (unless it were quite apparent that little to nothing was being spent on the planet) so how would we know if he is doing a bad job and should be voted out?


[15-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I wouldn't care if the governor kept a (reasonable) stipend. It's an annoying job - so why not? Transparency can be an issue, I think. There are again no built-in mechanisms to share all the financial data to the constituents. You kind of just have to trust the governor.

***Kiriaster** deleted this message.*


[15-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	On a side note - if someone wanted to be a crook about how much tax money could he get away with before the next election?


[15-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	@Ogre - we don't know.  :)


[15-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	You can have transparcency with public documents and screen shots of income.


[15-Dec-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It's not that hard to show honest governance


[15-Dec-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	@Ogre - he could take all of it.  Think about how many bases there are, how much production, times X NCC/day, plus LM ads... it adds up to quite a lot.


[15-Dec-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	BBH.NC1 BTA.NC1 HAB.NC1 BDE.NC1 LBH.NC1 LBE.NC1 LTA.NC1 LSE.NC1

**KostisPlayz**:	Oh no...


[15-Dec-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Right, I was just trying to get a sense of what "quite a lot" is.  500k?...2M?...50M?...


[15-Dec-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	/me makes a note to introduce Hydroa to image manipulation software :)


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	yes yes, you can fake those records too


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	but that's a lot of work for waht?


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If you want to cheat at the game, just make dummy accounts and have them support your mian


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	way easier than making an ADM, running for governer, and then makingweekly manipulated screenshots


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Anyone got a Peepee 3 and poopoo 2? I just need a brother/sister to help me out construct them in case I get the materials myself.


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Stealing the tax revenue isn't cheating, it's just taking a lot of advantage of the rules


[15-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If you wanna cheat the system, there are easier ways than being gov


[15-Dec-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	peepee 3? Where's I'm from it's a #1


[15-Dec-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	smh at @xk37


[15-Dec-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Stealing the tax revenu and lying about it by making weekly fake screen shots and maintaining fake books that look real is cheating, and it's a lot of work. Small mistakes and you get caught. If you wanna enhance your income beyond normal methods, you don't poorly run a planet and steal the money, you just make dummy accounts.


[15-Dec-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Ya'll paranoid


[15-Dec-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Just have open books and income screen shots. Other people will check the math and it'll work fine.


[15-Dec-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	You're the one suggested he would make screen shots.  I just assume that someone who wanted to steal the tax revenue wouldn't bother to tell anybody anything.


[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	And then they'll have 1 week of govoner, and nobody would elect them again


[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I'll say it again, and I'll try to use small words.  There's no accountability.


[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	You dont' stay gov forever


[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kiriaster**:	If I was gonna do this - I'm not, but if I was - I'd get just enough friends to vote for me to win, and I'd give all my friends a piece of the pie.  So, they have a $$$ interest in keeping me in the governor's mansion and they don't worry about the taxes because they get it all back, and more, from me.


[15-Dec-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Ahh, yes. The grand conspiracy.


[15-Dec-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Put on your tin foil hats everyone


[15-Dec-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	*they* are coming for your tax dollars.


[15-Dec-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The Prun deep state.


[15-Dec-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Somehow have enough people on the planet to control the elections and steal all the money


[15-Dec-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Don't be a dork.  You're saying "it can't happen", I'm telling you exactly how it could happen.  Plus, dork, it *has already happened*.  Person in SNF *did exactly that*.


[15-Dec-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I'm saying it's too much work to make a little money


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	And yet it already happened.


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I'm saying if you want to make a shit ton of money through dishonesty, there are easier ways


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Sorry to ask Kiriaster but can you please let me know about the SNF member to used Tax money for the Corp/Themselves? I haven't heard anything about this and I'm a very old player


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yeah, Prun really needs gunships. jackboot thugs, etc. Then things would get really interesting.


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	And yet it already happened.


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Show me.


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Where.


[15-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Back up your tin foil conspiricies


[15-Dec-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	I'm gonna be so sad there's no Mute button in this game.  Ah, well.  Maybe next universe.  :)


[15-Dec-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You can PM me if you wish, This is something I've never heard of so it's odd


[15-Dec-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Logging out now, back to the RL.  Have fun!


[15-Dec-21 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Kiriaster: It's a conspiricy! It's happening! It's happened before! But I can't be bothered to explain it so I'm going to leave now.


[15-Dec-21 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	at base tax rate of 10NCC the average base pays about 750NCC per day.  with 160 bases that comes to around $112K/day in taxes.  Then again, I think someone said taxes can go as high as 9999 so a greedy scumbucket could collect tens of millions per day until we all run out of money or leave.


[15-Dec-21 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I would halt production at too high a tax. most people would


[15-Dec-21 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Isnt Governor something you become when you have alot of € not something you become to earn alot of €


[15-Dec-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	They arent mutually exclusive


[15-Dec-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	people with losta money have an easier time becoming governor, but they can use that office for whatever means they please


[15-Dec-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	One of the bases I own is on a ungoverned planet 2000 pr week for war and over 100 pr day duration of ads do I rent a WAR or post LM no


[15-Dec-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	SO the market must have something to say wouldnt everybody close up shop if taxes were unreasonable?


[15-Dec-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	yes.


[15-Dec-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	I for one vote for high taxes


[15-Dec-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Dozens of planets have ADMs. There's been no big corruption scandles yet.


[15-Dec-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	People are paranoid. They see somewhere that exploitation *could* happen, and they freak out that it will happen.


[15-Dec-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	I vote for goldilocks taxes, just the right % no more no less


[15-Dec-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	You should always hold *healthy* skepticism in situations like this


[15-Dec-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	To maintain our current population we need 3-4 SSTs fully opperational. That's 38.7k - 51.6k per week in taxes that need to be collected.


[15-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	There are ~160 bases on this planet. If we assume they're all at 500 area (some like mine are at 1k area, others are new and small), we're looking somewhere around 9000 buildings. This is some big napkin math, so let's understand there are large error bars on this.


[15-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	9k buildings translates to 63k building days a week.


[15-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Taxes should be pretty low to just maintain.


[15-Dec-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If the average base size is less than 500 area, or take up more space than my average buildings (highly possible), then there might only be 5k buildings and 31k building days.


[15-Dec-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If we fund the INF, we need closer to 72k / week in taxes


[15-Dec-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	It'd be nice to have some extra taxes to fund future planetary projects


[15-Dec-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I like Rubicate's idea of having a one-person Corp to isolate the accounting for the Planet.  Spice already has that, though it would be nicer if the Corp Name had "Verdant" in it/


[15-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	yea atm it'd be best to have lowest taxes reasonable so we can get a feel for the minimum upkeep costs, then go RIGHT above that to help fund


[15-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ayaaa**:	Did Archon1/GTU already speak on what they would do differently?


[15-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	and I'm assuming he's gonna have a spreadsheet for it


[15-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	as we do have that kind of information available


[15-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	having the tax info be public record is always nice


[15-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and a good way to have clarity


[15-Dec-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	So


[15-Dec-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I have given myself two options.


[15-Dec-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	1) Go on a bfab shopping spree for the infustracture OR 2) Go on bfab sopping spree to expand so I can later buy all the bfabs possible


[15-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Hmm


[15-Dec-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Ew spreadsheets


[15-Dec-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I have no idea how much the tax will make. I doubt it would be worth to effort to embezzle it


[15-Dec-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I could make the case that i get 5% of tax as salary + to pay for the ADM but probably not worth the effort


[15-Dec-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	How would you be transparent with costs? revenue is easy too do


[15-Dec-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I don't have a problem with you putting some of the tax money back towards the ADM that you are putting in


[15-Dec-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Any decisions about taxs will be made after the first tax given to me


[15-Dec-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Cause Obviously its really hard to estimate how much itll be right now


[15-Dec-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	My brain too small for that atleast


[15-Dec-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	isn't the Sprice supposed to help with that?


[15-Dec-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Already on finishing the self-sufficiency plan and the BRM excavation project will begin shortly after I have set up everything on the long and painful company stability


[15-Dec-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Rough estimate put taxes in the neighborhood of 100K/wk


[15-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Wait what


[15-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	for the whole planet, not per base.


[15-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	erm what taxs is that set too


[15-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I havent said what my tax rates will be


[15-Dec-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Didn't you say you would start with minimum taxes.  I believe that is 10NCC


[15-Dec-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	i think on a non-faction planet the minimum is 0


[15-Dec-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Well, 0 would be non-taxes.  What is the lowest non-zero number that you can set it to?


[15-Dec-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	1


[15-Dec-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Could maybe do like Norway with one tax free month (december)


[15-Dec-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I asked rubi what i should start on and they said 20


[15-Dec-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If thats way too much than ill drop taxs and drop a whole bunch of SST and INF


[15-Dec-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I figured 10 based on what I've seen on several other planets.


[15-Dec-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	we'll see


[15-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If its too much that just means a bunch of infastrucure


[15-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	And ill drop tax down to the whatever upkeep costs amount


[15-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Of course, looking again it seems that 20-40 is more typical.


[15-Dec-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah, i think any higher than 20-40 is only needed if its a tech or more planet


[15-Dec-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	WAR will probably be set to 0


[15-Dec-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Circe - 120NCC


[15-Dec-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	They went from nothing to 2 scientists in 5 months.


[15-Dec-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Dang.  Up to 5 universities now.


[15-Dec-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah thats  a fair price for how much is getting built there


[15-Dec-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	So woulf anyone be interested in giving me a loan? I am willing to pay back in resources.


[15-Dec-21 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I am buying the nessacery components to start producing items for the planetery cause and also to continue my self-sufficiency plan


[15-Dec-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Also to get one of my ships out Montem because it's been there for over a months a half


[15-Dec-21 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	WAR will be as low as possible due to the tiny income it would make


[15-Dec-21 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Nice Population Report!


[15-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	wait, how do I get that 86080 number?


[16-Dec-21 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	I had also thought 537 is the number


[16-Dec-21 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	537 is the number of open jobs before the pop report came out


[16-Dec-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so in the last pop cycle


[16-Dec-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	there were 0 unemployed at the end but people had build jobs for 537 pop


[16-Dec-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i just take the 'change' number minus 'open jobs'


[16-Dec-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that works too


[16-Dec-21 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	I see, thanks


[16-Dec-21 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**StelioKontos**:	Sorry to see this - unfortunate that it reminds me of the same issues we had on Vallis back in the day - not sure it's worth leaving over adding an ADM to cover obviously growing population upkeep needs.


[16-Dec-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Or holding grudges for long-resolved issues from more than a year ago... that said, I hope it all works out for everyone. :-)

**Spice**:	I have enacted my first financial plan


[18-Dec-21 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	WAR are at the minimum 50


[18-Dec-21 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	LM fees I have set to whatever montem has, unsure what to set it as


[18-Dec-21 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Whoopie!  I can now afford to rent a second one (even though I don't need it).


[18-Dec-21 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Production fees left at the default 20, once a tax comes in it can be adjusted to whatever makes sense


[18-Dec-21 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I feel since we need the LM much more here on verdant, we probably should have less tax there


[18-Dec-21 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	That is true, I can set it to 0. That means that production fees will have to compensate ( I doubt much of a difference)


[18-Dec-21 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	i mean we're probably also supporting much less infra than montem as well


[18-Dec-21 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Im pretty sure lm fees are wayyyy below Production fees


[18-Dec-21 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	I think 0 is going to hinder more than help


[18-Dec-21 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	And definitely agree, production fees will be a way larger portion than LM fees


[18-Dec-21 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Why do you think 0 would be bad?


[18-Dec-21 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Because then Spice would have less money coming in to put towards upgrading our infrastructure to attract higher tier workers


[18-Dec-21 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	we pretty much dont need higher tier workers


[18-Dec-21 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	so thats fine


[18-Dec-21 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I won't be doing higher tier projects for a while, it was pretty much a campaign promise of mine


[18-Dec-21 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think that 2nd INF will be sufficient for the current level of tech demand.


[18-Dec-21 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Im open to discussion for it later but not now


[18-Dec-21 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Oh yeah I plan on building many SST and INF,


[18-Dec-21 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	leave the techies to other planets


[18-Dec-21 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Also, when does production fees tick? at the end of a bill?


[18-Dec-21 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Start


[18-Dec-21 12:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Do we get a notice of how much was taken out of our bank when we are assessed  fees?


[18-Dec-21 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	It shows when putting orders in, for example my COL cost 5.13NCC per craft


[18-Dec-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	huh why is resource extraction much cheaper than farming even though it both costs 20 ncc


[18-Dec-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Its cause of how long each craft takes


[18-Dec-21 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I think lol


[18-Dec-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Vel**:	SNF member Love had some shipping to be made, but I believe that they're asleep atm, I've notified him that you're available.. but I think he won't respond


[18-Dec-21 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	I can wait a few more h. I'm from Europe and I noticed that many people are online at night. When do they usually log in?


[18-Dec-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Ok, guys the ship is waiting at Montem for a few more hours. Ship anything to Verdant at any price! :)


[18-Dec-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	It's funny that there are plenty contracts from Verdant to every place, but nothing goes back.


[18-Dec-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Yeah that's the problem with Verdant, it's all export very little import


[18-Dec-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jdawgie**:	Is anyone selling the following?: RAT, DW, OVE..  I am trying to decide if I need buy thing at moria..  I havent seen  contracts in an  few days

**blueGeek**:	Does anyone want anything shipped from Montem to Verdant?


[18-Dec-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	gone.


[18-Dec-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	oops, let me sell ads run dry, I can post more for RAT/DW


[18-Dec-21 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	4.5 hours until I leave to Verdant from Moria Station. If you need anything rom the CX I will ship it for FREE It doesn't have to be a mega large shipment. A ton of small ones won't bother me. If you want a single bottle of water or a couple MCG it's fine. Put up the order on the Verdant LM


[18-Dec-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Direx**:	@Texx I placed several shipping ads on the MOR CX LM, Sorry I can


[18-Dec-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Direx**:	sorry I can't place them on verdant since I'm not on a PRO license


[18-Dec-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Texx**:	Accepted them. But you still have to provision one of them.


[18-Dec-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Selling SUN, RAT, and PWO, PM me for quantities and prices


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Wait


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Yo I think I found a tax cut on a recipe


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I am paying less than the original one xD


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	Hi. I am new. Producing water, drinkable, food and rations. But it seems that I need to sell it at Moria, because I dont have access to local market. My idea is to wait until I have a ship full of things to sell (to be more fuel-efficency), go there, buy OVE, sell my things and so. But it seems that I am going to take a lot of time to grow. Any better idea?


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Nope.


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Viel gluck!


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	Which should be the next step?


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	To build or to do?


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You should do some math


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	H20.NC1 isn't much cheaper than DW.NC1


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	H2O.NC1


[19-Dec-21 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I would suggest trying to balancing H2O, FRM,FP,BMP


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Might be easier to get a ship full of H2O and sell that


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	But then water becomes an issue


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	Ok, good idea.


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I recommend balancing stuff out unless you got a lot a lot of water


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Then again i don't know your workforce or your future plans


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	I have 200 pioneers, but only using 120 of them


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The best plan at the start is to figure out what makes you the most money based on what you can build


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	this lets you make later, more expensive plans


[19-Dec-21 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	then plans just for the heck of it

[19-Dec-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	10320 NCC, so very rough estimate might be 20-30k tax?


[20-Dec-21 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Hmm


[20-Dec-21 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	@Spice have you noticed any of the argi recipes?


[20-Dec-21 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Maybe you want to up the prices at least by 3 NCC on the NS argicultural product


[20-Dec-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Noticed what? I don't get what you mean sorry


[20-Dec-21 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spotless**:	question: is it possible to have a second base on the same planet? if not, any planet recomendations?


[20-Dec-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	no you cant have a second base on a planet you already settled


[20-Dec-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	but you can expand your first base with base permits


[20-Dec-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and increase your area by 250 per permit 2 times


[20-Dec-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spotless**:	ok, thanks for the info


[20-Dec-21 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	you can do it if you type "BS" in a buffer


[20-Dec-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	BTW if anyone has opinions/thoughts/ideas on what I should do on Verdant, welcome to hmu and talk


[20-Dec-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I see you've added yet another infirmary.  Is that necessary with 4500 settlers?


[20-Dec-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	it will be 7 SST and 3 INF to get to full happiness


[20-Dec-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	it is for the workers, when they go crazy and we need the asylum.


[20-Dec-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	After that I probably wont build SST INF, as its unlikely they will fall below 70% for a long time


[20-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Right.  We need them to be happy and healthy...  Nobody cares about 'wise'.


[20-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	Just like the book "We"


[20-Dec-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Spice** deleted this message.*


[20-Dec-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The INF upkeep is ~2.3k p/d, which should be fine


[20-Dec-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Considering the price of SUN however for SST 9-10 could be considered


[20-Dec-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Question about upkeep It appears to me that consuption is set to the maximum that the SST/INF can do and pulls from whatever is available in reserve.  It would be nice if consumption were set to the planet's actual needs.  For example, I have an SST on a 1 base planet.  Consumption is 50DW every 3 days but I only need to do about 15DW to get full happiness.  So I have to manually add the 15DW each time instead of loading up the reserves.


[20-Dec-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	9-10 SST is fine


[20-Dec-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Its just the SUN thats a bit expensive, other 2 are cheap


[20-Dec-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	@Spice Production of RCO with NS costs the same but takes less time to produce creating a small pocket for avoiding taxes


[20-Dec-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Even though it's small


[20-Dec-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	In total for me (after I bring workforce upkeep materials) will be 1k NCC tax avoidance


[20-Dec-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Or at least around that mark.


[20-Dec-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	@Spice, you need to dispatch the tax police!


[21-Dec-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Do you mean the HYF tax is lower than the FRM, oth for RCO? I was under the impression that the tax is for daily building use, so same for each building


[21-Dec-21 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I just did a back-of-the-envelope calculation for RCO - the tax/day/building works out about the same for each of the three recipes. (FARM/FARM+NS/HYF)


[21-Dec-21 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	FRM+NS is lower time+more RCO


[21-Dec-21 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Or the way I like to call it "TAX  negotiation" xD


[21-Dec-21 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Go ahead and avoid tax if you can


[21-Dec-21 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I legalise tax avoidance


[21-Dec-21 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also ill decide fully in ~5.5 days when the tax rev comes in but at the current rates looks like ill be expanding popi pretty fast


[21-Dec-21 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Anyonr got BBH and BSE to sell to me?


[21-Dec-21 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Dec-21 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	FP at 75% xD

**KostisPlayz**:	Can someone sell me PE?


[21-Dec-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I need 33 PE


[21-Dec-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	If I have to buy more than I will happily to do so.


[21-Dec-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	@KostisPlayz I can help you with 2xBBH and 2xBSE if its still relevant


[21-Dec-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	If you put up buy order at cxl price


[21-Dec-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	How different? A shpload of O is 438 u, while SIO is 279. Transporting SIO is more costly than O.


[22-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	*shipload


[22-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you should not look at CXP, rather CXPC


[22-Dec-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	The charts only show that demand for O is twice as much. And SIO price was around 50 a few months ago.


[22-Dec-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	and he'd pay for it+upkeep


[22-Dec-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	although if taxes needed time to accumulate it would speed things up with donations


[22-Dec-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bignstronk**:	no wait


[22-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	am I right to say that now there's 10 job openings on the planet for techs?


[22-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	mhm


[22-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	40-30 new techs?


[22-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	10 open jobs left for techies


[22-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	ah i see


[22-Dec-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	i finally graduated from POPR interpretation class


[22-Dec-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	damnnnnn 1k pios in reserve


[22-Dec-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	are the unemployment figures current?


[22-Dec-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	do I calculate 3.7% * 98,511 to find out pios in reserve?


[22-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Sort of


[22-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You take last POPR's PIO count and apply the unemployment to them


[22-Dec-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Current population minus open jobs is the number of reserves available.


[22-Dec-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Another way to calculate it is to open building construction window.  The number in parentheses is the number of workers available to you which is 10% of the total reserves.  Currently, I see that number in parentheses is 1026 so total reserves for the planet is 10,260


[22-Dec-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	oh i see


[22-Dec-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	the math kinda checks out


[22-Dec-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	i calculated that currently we have 10,238 PIOs looking for jobs on the planet


[22-Dec-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	unemployment baby


[22-Dec-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	the first method I said (pop-open jobs) is not correct.  I don't know where I came up with that one.


[22-Dec-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	thanks so much anyway mate.


[22-Dec-21 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	90418* .037 = 3345.466, 90418+3345.466= 93764 Pop jobs. Gotta round up to 93765 since jobs are always multiples of 5. Game uses lots of hidden decimals so this isn't unusual


[22-Dec-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	So is everyone going to employ all these new pioneers or are we just going to see them all hanging out in front of the local home depot?


[22-Dec-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Then 98511 current pop minus 93764 pop jobs = 4746 unused PIOs


[22-Dec-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So you basically have to use the current employment/unemployment situation on last POPR's pop numbers to determine current pop jobs and subtract that from current pop to figure out the reserve


[22-Dec-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Super straightforward, right?


[22-Dec-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	uh huh....


[22-Dec-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	i will interpret this POPR as "many workforce can be employed"


[22-Dec-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I should say so considering it will let me hire 1026 pioneers which is more than my entire base currently employs.


[22-Dec-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the new players will employ some... but yes most prob gonna be hanging out at home depot


[22-Dec-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	wonder what do they eat at home depot


[22-Dec-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	How many of the recent large wave of new players ended up settling on Verdant?


[22-Dec-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not many heh


[22-Dec-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Is there any value in having a large unemployed population?  Does it help the planet in any way?  Does it attract more people to start bases?


[22-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	nope... but it prevents another pio shortage for a while


[22-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If my math is correct (and it most definitely is) 6 new bases were added in the last week.


[22-Dec-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Last I heard they haven't implemented ghost plots yet so none of the new players could have gone to Promitor.


[22-Dec-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I heard Harmonia got bum rushed by new players


[22-Dec-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Unemployed PIO's actually cost money in taxes to maintain (just like in real life, lol)


[22-Dec-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But yeah, you want some of them so you can just build buildings and have them available. Otherwise you need to build buildings, and slowly over weeks enough would catch up and join your workforce


[22-Dec-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Wow.  Close to 50 new bases there.


[22-Dec-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I hope they open Outer Heaven for new players soon! We built the infrastructure but can't really do much more until people actually go live there


[22-Dec-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the CoGC is gonna shoot up at Harmonia...


[22-Dec-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Hehe, Harmonia's POPR says change is -153 for pioneers but the population jumped by 9500 so the increase is ALL new bases.


[22-Dec-21 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hoooly crap


[22-Dec-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Wonder why they all bum rushed Harmonia


[22-Dec-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Maybe Steam will transform PrUn after all


[22-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	I settled on Verdant hoping to become a farmer


[22-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Same


[22-Dec-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	maybe... it all depends on the player wave... and marketing


[22-Dec-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And then I went south to the big city to make my fortunes


[22-Dec-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	They were saying they would be happy with a 50% player increase as a result of Steam.  But that is still a couple months away.


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Watch em get 500% increase instead


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	well i started off wanting to trash the prices of basic consumables... but ehhh went into bfabs and looking at INS in the like 2-3 months future


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	how can PrUn be played on steam?


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	i feel this game has a lot of allure because it's played as a browser game


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	They run it in a Chromium client


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Anyway, since not a lot of victuallers came to the Moria region then maybe us Verdant people will clean up when this wave of new players causes food prices to rise.


[22-Dec-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	oh


[22-Dec-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That happened during the player wave I joined in


[22-Dec-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	The last big one in August


[22-Dec-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	RAT was above 70 on the regular


[22-Dec-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That's when I joined.  3 days before you.


[22-Dec-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Shit that's right. Man how time flies


[22-Dec-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and i joined in september... prices were still around high 60+ then iirc


[22-Dec-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bignstronk**:	old farmers reminiscing on Verdant


[22-Dec-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**IDKanything**:	heh


[22-Dec-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Somedays I miss the simple life on the farm, lol


[22-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	oof... i see a bunch of hydration timeouts when i refreshed the slow browser... might just be me tho idk


[22-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol Vallis just filled up


[22-Dec-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Dude this is like what, day 1 of Steam?


[22-Dec-21 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It would be exciting to have 1000's of new players


[22-Dec-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I welcome a new version of chaos.


[22-Dec-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Watch em have to reset the universe cause ALL the planets are full in a month


[22-Dec-21 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Or maybe they could enable the corporate terraformer building and we could make new ones habitable


[22-Dec-21 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JerryM**:	would we have a universe reset once steam is live ?


[22-Dec-21 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There was no plan for it, but if this rate of new joins keeps up...


[22-Dec-21 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	They'll have to do something


[22-Dec-21 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And I know they finished a new universe generator, but not in time for this universe


[22-Dec-21 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JerryM**:	nice


[22-Dec-21 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But who knows, there might be other ways to keep this one going for a while longer


[22-Dec-21 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And I'm getting waaay ahead of myself


[22-Dec-21 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Just excited to see so many new players all of the sudden


[22-Dec-21 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	yep this game is  really boomin' nice to see


[22-Dec-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JerryM**:	steam would bring subscription cost in more currencies, means less to pay in local currency :)


[22-Dec-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Dec-21 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also I'm considering building more INF and dropping down to 2 upkeeps, thoughts?


[24-Dec-21 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Might be pointless haven't decided


[24-Dec-21 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i would love to help but no clue how it works : D


[24-Dec-21 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not needed yet, so dont't? if we have too much excess ur just paying for upkeep when we don't need to


[24-Dec-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If i were to build more INF, and only upkeeped 2 consumables Im fairly sure it be cheaper. Ill wait though anyhow


[24-Dec-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hmm


[24-Dec-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	I heard that happiness is supposed to be at least 50% otherwise population starts migrating out. So maybe that should be a priority?


[24-Dec-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	(Also I make TUB so thats cheap for me, STR on the other hand)


[24-Dec-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah that makes sense


[24-Dec-21 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	then sure, if its less costly by dropping down to 2 upkeep with more popi


[24-Dec-21 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	@bluegeek happiness is currently 78% which means pop is growing.


[24-Dec-21 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Only pioneers, settlers and tech much lower. Personally I only use pios so far, but if in the future people will want to build ORC or anything hi tech, they'll need high tier population.


[24-Dec-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Verdant system has planets with CUO, LIO, TIO, so it's not far fetched.


[24-Dec-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	btw, if population migrates out, do they simply disappear or do they move to another planet?


[24-Dec-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The bugs eats them, actually. When we first settled this planet we were pretty freaked out by it... but they mostly leave us alone, (mostly), and they do a great job, uh, cleaning up.


[24-Dec-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	@bluegeek you prop not get your hopes too high regarding evre seeing this backwater farming planet as the new Sillicon Valley anytime soon.


[24-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	The system planets all have a nasty combination of pressure and temp conditions that present a significant cost and hardship to build anything there


[24-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	yeah, I know, just looking into possibilities.

[24-Dec-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**blueGeek**:	Welcome!


[25-Dec-21 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	Hi, new at Verdant. About a week playing here. I have 4 RIG, and I have become the first expert. Hope to help developing the planet in the future, but I am going to need lot of time to grow...


[25-Dec-21 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Ok


[25-Dec-21 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Let me know if you need food and clothes.


[25-Dec-21 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	I have started at Verdant with 4 RIGs, 1 FARM and 1 FP. Thinking about building more Farms to build and incinerator. Sounds like a good plan to you, guys?


[25-Dec-21 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	C takes up a lot of space, max 222 units full ship iirc so if shipping isnt a concern for u then sure, or if ur planning to use C in the future urself


[25-Dec-21 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	why did you build so many rigs...? one rig here supports 2-3 frms depending on what you produce


[25-Dec-21 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	I calculated that I will need several RIG to keep the FP doing a lot of DW


[25-Dec-21 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah ic


[25-Dec-21 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	FP demolishes H2O


[25-Dec-21 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yep, but i made an assumption that someone just starting out wouldn't be using an FP 100% for DW... thought it would be more like 40% DW 60% RAT or something along those lines


[25-Dec-21 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShootingStar**:	Yes, now I am doing some RAT also, and I have an excess of water, but I will correct it when I have money for more buildings


[25-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Somebody plz sell me 30 RATs, asap?  Been offline for 10 days, now workers are too hungry & mad to make RATs.

[27-Dec-21 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	@Vebski No


[28-Dec-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	You just need to keep upgrading your HQ and also have PRO


[28-Dec-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Every HQ upgrade is an extra permit


[28-Dec-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	I have 3/5 now, cannot add more permits here


[28-Dec-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vebski**:	looking at discord there seems to be a limit of 3 permits per base


[28-Dec-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	That's correct, you can't deploy more than 3 permits per planet, but you get more permits by upgrading your HQ.


[28-Dec-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	So max base size (at least for now) is 1000


[29-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Can someone sell me a single piece of limestone?

**Spice**:	Yeah i dont think its a good idea, just wondering on peoples thoughts on the matter


[02-Jan-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	lets build 6 UNI's


[02-Jan-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Taxs would only have to be tax times 20 for just the upkeep of 6 unis. Probably times 30 tbf

**KostisPlayz**:	Well shit, that came out of nowhere


[03-Jan-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Uhh Spice, I would have let you know that the tax for SIL and NL would have to get lowered in price and in time somewhat demolished.


[03-Jan-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Combination of these two bring BND which these provide upkeep for EMC and HOS


[03-Jan-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	When you write taxes you mean production fees?


[03-Jan-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	at this level 20 NCC they have minimal impact on the individual but ice support for the popi


[03-Jan-22 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Yes, he's talking about production fees.  But he's kidding about raising them.  If anything, they might go down if there isn't anything we want to spend it on besides upkeep for the existing SSs and INFs.


[03-Jan-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I mean I am planning on grabbing some scientists from Montem


[03-Jan-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Currently I think we need more techs


[03-Jan-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I also need a shit ton of ammonia to make many donations to the pop inf


[03-Jan-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	its included in the prod fee


[03-Jan-22 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	currently you gonna have a hard time grabbing any SCI from Montem


[03-Jan-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	How much per 1 IDC for fee?


[03-Jan-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You mean because there aren't any scientists on Montem or any POPI to make them?


[04-Jan-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	theres hardly any SCI in the whole galaxy ATM


[04-Jan-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	That's beyong bullshit


[04-Jan-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	They are currently being used to make ships


[04-Jan-22 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Ehh sry have you seen any SCI on Montem popi report?


[04-Jan-22 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	Lets leave it here GL getting SCI on Montem


[04-Jan-22 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Oh yeah I was kidding, If no extra upkeep is added than Taxs will be lowered eventually


[04-Jan-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Paying of my investment into the planet and than dropping by uh a third? or something


[04-Jan-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i think if we're gonna keep the popi we have rn and not add more taxes could be like 18-20 for agri (since our CoGC is more or less never gonna tilt towards anything else) and 15-16 for everything else since they don't really benefit from the CoGC boost


[04-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LouisXVI**:	That could be a solution, simple yet good


[04-Jan-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	As it is, we're going to have a lot of unemployed pioneers unless a bunch of new bases show up.


[04-Jan-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yeye so assuming we dont add more stuff... for a damn long while :P kinda feel like POPI went overboard ngl but not complaining about the reserve pool :D


[05-Jan-22 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Yeah I could have watched popi carefully and expand it slowly but its just easier to plop a bunch down


[05-Jan-22 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Now we can all ignore popi for the foreseeable future


[05-Jan-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Reducing the tax's for non agri also seems pretty fair


[05-Jan-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-22 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It is not. For 100% we'd need 8; but, we don't need 100%. As long as Unemployment is growing, we're supplying more than we actually need.

[07-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

Where Does The Term 'Gubernatorial' Come From?
Saturday is the final gubernatorial election of 2019. It got us wondering why we use the term "gubernatorial" in the first place. Hint: It goes back to Latin.

[09-Jan-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Interestingly, this is mainly a U.S. usage, says McLendon, "Most other varieties of English spoken throughout the world do not use gubernatorial."... ah no wonder i never heard of it before :P


[09-Jan-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Does the UK or really any country whose political system is built on it have governors?


[09-Jan-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	that word is just... never used XD


[09-Jan-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean in the US it's an adjective to describe something related to a governor, so if you don't have governors, that word wouldn't be very useful


[09-Jan-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	I mean... it is used just not frequently enough for its meaning to be known by everyone :P and im one of those peopl who didnt know


[09-Jan-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Commonwealth countries have Governor-General's


[09-Jan-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jan-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jan-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	How long until we get more engis?


[20-Jan-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Very slowly.


[20-Jan-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If someone builds something that uses engis, there will be open engi jobs and we'll get more of them.


[20-Jan-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	But you'll have to run your building short for a while


[20-Jan-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I'm planning on building some engi tech... but I'm concerned about pumping in a bunch of money to raise their numbers only to have someone else snatch up the workers that I'm going to invest a half milion in producing.


[20-Jan-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	tl;dr: if you want engis, build engi buildings / give me some donations so I can build the 2 wild life parks we need


[20-Jan-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that is a frustrating part about trying to build up populations on your own, there's no way to guarantee you have it


[20-Jan-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**realbandit**:	Importing FEO (on empty inbound ships) to make FE>STL>PT here is a decent option we considered in SNF - saves quite a bit of shipping capacity if you have a large guaranteed market for PT.


[21-Jan-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Okay y'all can have a temporary Tax break


[30-Jan-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Cause I was probably over taxing woops


[30-Jan-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also do you guys think dropping upkeeps should be based on Unemployment, Happiness, Needs or actual # of unemployed


[30-Jan-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	for the amount of POPI you threw down plus upkeep, idts 20/day was that much


[30-Jan-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	20/d let me recoup the costs but no ones really settling verdant so just been dropping upkeeps


[30-Jan-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	if popi stuff stays the same ill pop it back to 10/d in 2 tax payments or so


[30-Jan-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I would be more happy on lower fees for warehouses rather than producation fees.


[30-Jan-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	While I understandbly see why that wouldn't work for people that are starting (or are in case of limited upkeep), I would still disagree on that decision.


[30-Jan-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the warehouse minimum IS 50/week


[30-Jan-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I have 2 and soon it will 4


[30-Jan-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	So 200 per week


[30-Jan-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Spice can't set that any lower


[30-Jan-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Right....


[30-Jan-22 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Regardless, I have started making deals for pop buildings


[30-Jan-22 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	unless you are planning on upgrading the warehouse, the max number you can rent rn is 2


[30-Jan-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	prob better to build a STO at that point


[30-Jan-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	After building a park then yes I will upgrade the warehouse


[30-Jan-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	@IDK I am saving as much space as  possible because I am currently on a tight capacity


[30-Jan-22 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you have to rent it up 4 times to get 4 rentable units

**IDKanything**:	and an STO is much cheaper than a warehouse upgrade... STO gives 5000 capacity for 15 area


[30-Jan-22 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-22 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I was mostly going to make BE, but I don't think BGC is going to be a bottleneck, so I can afford some TA / TAI time.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	My ships are in almost constant motion with full loads.  Except when going to my HE3 planet for a pickup.  So I built an EDM just so I would have a reason to bring something heavy in that direction.

[09-Feb-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	well that was only because my ship was partially empty and h2o was going on the cx at 30/u since 1-2 days ago

[09-Feb-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That's crazy.  I started tearing down rigs but reversed course and put them back a couple weeks ago.  Still, I'd rather just buy water and make room for other buildings.  If you list it here at CX rate minus shipping cost then I'll buy it.


[09-Feb-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I would probably buy some h2o here as well, at least for awhile


[13-Feb-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Ok.  I should have things going by the end of the week.  I don't have Pro anymore so I can't post ads but I will pick up any buy order that is within 20% of the CX price.


[13-Feb-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	*looks at cx price*... welp


[13-Feb-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	honestly you can make a decent lot right now dumping h2o to cx... thought the drought wouldn't last that long


[13-Feb-22 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	True, but I'd rather not deal with the hassle of shipping it all.  As it is, my ships are so busy that I only come to Verdant about once every 5 days and there is already a full load waiting for me.

[13-Feb-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	hell we could make SCI with enough tax. For now ill set it all to 10 like i said i would earlier


[13-Feb-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Look at those tax rates lmao


[13-Feb-22 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	lmao ENG and SCI


[13-Feb-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Tech goes up too 29,997 tax fyi


[13-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	phew, glad I'm not running any really high tier stuff lol


[13-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	considering the cost of sci popi its actually fair tbh


[13-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	probably true


[13-Feb-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Are those the prices to generate eng/sci workers?  Does it really cost that much per worker or do you actually get like 25 worker for that price?


[13-Feb-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Nevertheless, I don't think taxes is the best way to collect money for worker spawning.


[13-Feb-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Hydroa just employed the 1 engineer currently on planet.  With those tax rates you're going to make him go broke.


[13-Feb-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	the tax is per building per day on 100% efficiency right? so arent they not going to pay that high amount


[13-Feb-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Yes, but the tax rate is still higher than what a person can produce.


[13-Feb-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	As an example, the SE with a full staff of 30 eng produced 1 EDC per day which is worth 16000NCC.  Taxes are 750% higher than the profit.  Even if you calculate based on the 1 eng he currently employs it works out the same.   3.3% of the taxes but also 3.3% productivity.


[13-Feb-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Even something more profitable like an AML which uses a mix of tech/eng would be paying about 70000/day in taxes to produce 20000/day of goods.


[13-Feb-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah... ic... didnt do the math on that :P


[13-Feb-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	At the moment, people looking for tech/eng are willing to pay for POPI themselves.  Taxes only need to be charged if the governor is going to take care of the POPI.  As for spawning population, whoever wants that done can just pay the governor directly.


[13-Feb-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Yes. Spice. Please. Lower the engi taxes. I just dumped an obscene amount of money to create engis on this planet and now they aren't just expensive, I litterally lose more money on taxes than I make employing my engis.


[13-Feb-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Please sir.


[13-Feb-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It costs me 12k in taxes now to make 1 BE.


[13-Feb-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	Verdant's new tax policy: "Everything just goes on Hydroa's tab!"


[13-Feb-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	opps


[13-Feb-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I set them high as a joke because i think anyone would employ the single engineer we have


[14-Feb-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	didnt*


[14-Feb-22 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	/me grumbles about lost hours of productivity while my AML wasn't running


[14-Feb-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Didn't you have anything in the queue?  A change in taxes doesn't affect queued items.


[14-Feb-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	that can't be true


[14-Feb-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You can confirm by looking at the queue of your other buildings.  Anything that was in there before Spice raised taxes from 0 to 10 should show 0 for the production fee.


[14-Feb-22 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Of course it can be true.  The tax is collected when the item starts production, at the then-current rate.


[14-Feb-22 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	that's wild. I thought it'd just apply the tax rate as soon as it entered production, not the quque


[14-Feb-22 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Correct, the tax is collected when the item moves from the queue to production.  But the tax amount to be collected is set when the item is added to the queue.


[14-Feb-22 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I had no idea


[14-Feb-22 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	What a strange function


[14-Feb-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	hmm taxing higher tier pops to pay for high teir popi doesnt really work here anyways


[14-Feb-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It will once those pops exist and are put to work.


[14-Feb-22 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Most of the technicians are currently employed as is the 1 engineer.


[14-Feb-22 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Problem is I run with pretty low safety and health


[14-Feb-22 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	so tech and engi growth is alot slower


[14-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Oh yeah, that's something to keep in mind @Hydroa.  Need fulfillment is set to the lower tier.  In other words, even if you do enough upkeep in the Wildlife Park to get Comfort up to 100% if Health is only at 56% then the game will treat Comfort as if it was also 56%


[14-Feb-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	yup


[14-Feb-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Looks like I'll be subsudizing your healthcare


[14-Feb-22 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	sorry! verdant's pop and base # are shrinking so high need funfillment isnt on the agenda


[14-Feb-22 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Your could also just can your efforts on Verdant and join me on one of my planets.  I'm building a mini Circe.


[14-Feb-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	While that sounds nice, this is my home.


[14-Feb-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I've got a few planets in the area, and they all work together nicely


[14-Feb-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The newest update has destroyed the need for popi buildings sadlu


[14-Feb-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You think so?  The next POPI on Circe will probably be a good indicator.


[14-Feb-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Eh, 100 techs is nice, but the percentile growth from a happy population is probably better


[14-Feb-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It's a good way to jump start a group


[14-Feb-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	oh circe is a huge money waste now


[14-Feb-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	but in the long term is not that great


[14-Feb-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	spawning 25 sci is insanely cheaper that buildings


[14-Feb-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Is there a set amount of population you can spawn each week or can you do as much as you want depending on available cash?


[14-Feb-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	yeah, for SCI it's super worth, but if you don't have the popi to back it up, you'll lose some.


[14-Feb-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	At some point you'l just be replacing lost SCI through unhappiness


[14-Feb-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	were all still testing but i set the program, 7 days later its 'finished' and than it spawns e.g. 100 tech on next popi report


[14-Feb-22 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	the dumb thing hydroa is that its still way cheaper to just non-stop spawn them


[14-Feb-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...and it's not like you can't also make the spawned people happy.


[14-Feb-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	you can give 20% happiness to everyone :)


[14-Feb-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	with 0 happiness, you'd lose 10% of a population / report, so at 1k techs (with 0 happiness) you'd lose the same number as you get through buying them, and your government program will forever be maintainig those 1k techs.. While 0 happiness is unlikely, I'm just illustrating that the no popi approach isn't sustainable


[14-Feb-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	plus give them jobs, build a library.  Most of them will end up sticking around.


[14-Feb-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If you want to grow *all* the populations, popi is good


[14-Feb-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If you just want some of one type, buying is good


[14-Feb-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	sure but not with sci


[14-Feb-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	its millions of bucks just to education up to sci


[14-Feb-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'm about to open my second Pharma Factory to make ADR.  I will have millions in a few weeks.


[14-Feb-22 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-22 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	CapitanIncognito is the one who posted it, YI-280d does indeed have a LM (just less visibility than Verdant LM), and if no-one else wants the contract I'll pick it up later today - 7k is a very good amount.

**collot999**:	The complexity in this game means that you can't really make everything yourself, you'll have to rely on the market on some stuff, like supplies, fuel, etc… Also, expanding vertically is a process that require a lot of investment and does not give big results in a short term.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Hey @Spice.   Hydroa and I were discussing upkeep for the PAR.  He pointed out that pioneers & settlers require some comfort too.  It's a small percentage, but considering the size of those populations it significantly increases the upkeep requirement beyond what is just needed for the technicians & engineers.  Is there room in the planet budget to contribute something to the PAR upkeep?


[23-Mar-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Depends on how much "something" is


[23-Mar-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	also is this for techs or engi? both have unemployment


[23-Mar-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I'll fill everything but DEC


[23-Mar-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I think taht should be enough


[23-Mar-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	it'll take a few weeks to even out, but we'll eventually get to stable again


[23-Mar-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	then maybe we can bribe some government officials to buy more engis for us


[23-Mar-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Programs are broken asf, using them for tech/engi is much cheaper than popi


[23-Mar-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	double checking, are you asking me to fill the DEC requirement?


[23-Mar-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Tech population is going down.  Should settle around 350.  Engineers are all employed with 7 job openings.


[23-Mar-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Is the Family Support III program you're running an experiment or are you trying to build up the pioneer/settler reserves?


[23-Mar-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	well we need more pioneers so i popped more upkeeps in but it didnt work


[23-Mar-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	+ program


[23-Mar-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I don't think we need the planet to provide any dEC


[23-Mar-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	If we needed any, it'd just be 10


[23-Mar-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Says it increases the "natural growth" by 20%.  Current growth is <0.  So is it +20% or *20%?


[23-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Theres a bug in the stuff


[23-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I dont think so, the natural growth is 0 so 20% doesnt do anything


[23-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It was doing addititve % without capping, which is why all the planet populations are out of whack right now


[23-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	BTW if you want to fully supply comfort need your going to need 9 parks


[23-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	idk if it's been patched yet


[23-Mar-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	uhh no.


[23-Mar-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The planet has comfort needs of 5355


[23-Mar-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	each park provides 2500


[23-Mar-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	We don't need comfort at 100% either, we just need Engi happiness above 50%


[23-Mar-22 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	We will need open jobs, or to provide a lot more health though


[23-Mar-22 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Idk maybe my calculator is massively wrong but mine says a need of 16k Comfort


[23-Mar-22 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I see LS as 51.7k, Safety as 26.4k, health as 16k, comfort at 5.36k, culture at 3277 and education at 2236


[23-Mar-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	lmao fixed it, i agree nw


[23-Mar-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	But i say again, what are you actually asking for


[23-Mar-22 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Essentially, we're trying to find the best way to maintain a population of 80 engineers.


[23-Mar-22 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I think it is unreasonable to ask the planet to fund our little project


[23-Mar-22 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Based on the latest POPR, engineers are probably understaffed now - the 17.5% unemployment applies to the previos POPR count, so they're likely missing 7 engineers right now. Easiest way to keep it there is probably with the OP Government programs.


[23-Mar-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I think Ogre should pitch in the costs since he and I are the only one using Engis, and I built the park and do most of the upkeep.


[23-Mar-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	-_-


[23-Mar-22 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	@realbandit makes sense, as long as the planet has government programs to spare. But if the governement needs ti for any other week, we'll get hoosed.


[23-Mar-22 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I'd like to keep it nice and reliable.


[23-Mar-22 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Can't trust the government to do it for you.


[23-Mar-22 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	No offense spice.


[23-Mar-22 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I would not trust me too


[23-Mar-22 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, good point @Hydroa, even every 2nd week runnign the Engi immigration would probbaly be enough. But maintain the PAR upkeep would go a long way to keeping them even without the program.


[23-Mar-22 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The PIO's and SET's just suck up so much of the Comfort though... worst part about growing high tier pops on massive worlds


[23-Mar-22 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Which is the only reason I brought it up.


[23-Mar-22 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Honestly, the best thing might be to stop feeding the population at all. Let it dwindle for a while so that it's easier to feed later


[23-Mar-22 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I normally just do 1 upkeep but education program has destroyed the reserve pioneers


[23-Mar-22 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	gotta bleed some settlers


[23-Mar-22 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Maybe we could get a population supression program to emigrate them?


[23-Mar-22 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Where is my deportation program


[23-Mar-22 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Settlers are already bleeding.  At this rate, the settler population will be at a manageable 2000 or so in about 3 weeks.


[23-Mar-22 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Its verdant i should be ableto exile settlers to go live in a private village or something


[23-Mar-22 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Or de-educate them and make them go back to being pioneers.


[23-Mar-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Woh


[23-Mar-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	@spice


[23-Mar-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I just ran some numbers, it looks like your population boost program did bleed the crap out of our people


[23-Mar-22 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	We should have lost only 341 settlers to migration, and 64 techs


[23-Mar-22 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The Planetary Festivities program you ran last month seemed to work well.  Increased pioneer happiness from 53% to 73% and we got a decent amount of migration.


[23-Mar-22 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	and only 6 engis


[23-Mar-22 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	You did a deportation program.


[23-Mar-22 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	do it again!


[23-Mar-22 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...and we really only lost 4% of the pioneers as a result of that Advanced Education program.  Running the Festivities for 2 weeks will recoup that.


[23-Mar-22 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Actually, Festivities program will help us as well with Engineer happiness.  Definitely, you should run that for the next 2 or 3 weeks.


[23-Mar-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...with an engineer spawning thrown in there as well :)


[23-Mar-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	i mean im def already subsiding the gov so idk, I need to redo my finance sheet


[24-Mar-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Hydroa and I would pay for the eng spawning.  That is only fair.  And actually, after doing a little rough calculating, the Festivities would bring pioneer happiness to 78% which I believe means 8% migration or about 8k pioneers.  That nearly doubles our reserves.


[24-Mar-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If you are subsidizing the gov then that means taxes are too low.

[30-Mar-22 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Interesting.  Despite the fact that technician population has been plummeting the last few weeks several tech buildings were thrown up this week.   We went from needing 455 to fill all jobs to needing 625.  At least pioneers have stopped declining (except for the 3 bases that left).  Hey @spice, a Planetary Festivities program would be a big help for all worker tiers.


[30-Mar-22 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	FYI - if you ever decide to do an Advanced Education program again they fixed the bug that caused huge population shifts.  It is now *30% instead of +30%.

[31-Mar-22 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	I'm not, personally. As long as the money is being used for upkeep of the basic upkeep, its fine though. (Though the advanced infrastructure should still be upkept by the people who use it)


[31-Mar-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	*the basic infrastructure

**IDKanything**:	tax raise? sure just not too high :P


[31-Mar-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	can always do a targeted tax raise for those who would benefit from the changes


[31-Mar-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	oh true, its the tech people wanting this so 29997 NCC is a fair tax rate


[31-Mar-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	even if we aren't talking about the tax raise for higher tier growth, won't mind normal taxes being around the 20-mark since we have been keeping taxes considerably low


[31-Mar-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	29997 might be a bit high for my taste for TEC lol


[31-Mar-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	as long as taxes are resonable, should not be an issue, even if you tax the higher tier, I am one of the higer tier that will be effected as soon as I drop my ORC, but lets not over tax to the point where I will just tear down and move. I just got here again


[31-Mar-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	wait that was a joke because thats the max tax rate BUT a fairly high tax rate on techs might actually be fair


[31-Mar-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	depends on how hight, if you tax to high you may lose the players that would be paying it, and then your still in a hole


[31-Mar-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	or 1000's? The prime minister orders one of you peasents to do math


[31-Mar-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	if i dont get results than 29997 tax rate it is!


[31-Mar-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	right now, while I am waiting on Fabs, I just carry PIOs, but soon I will have SETs and Techs....and when you start talking about taxing higher tiers yu have to remember that we still pay taxes on the lower tiiers as well


[31-Mar-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	problem is we have so few tech buildings on planet that getting 80k from them for programs probably wont work not sure


[31-Mar-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you could possibly do a donation drive where you post 1u H2O sell ads for like 20k or smth (dk how expensive it is to run those programs) for those wanting to contribute funds to pick up


[31-Mar-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	oh so its 50k for 100 techs now


[31-Mar-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	i need to increase normal upkeep before we have a pioneer shortage, but doing the tech immigration every second or more weeks could work


[31-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	taxes here are certainly dirt cheap, no doubt about that


[31-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but a strategic increase probably would be beneficial


[31-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Only because there was alot of excess of pioneers that werent needed

**Spice**:	but the edu program? i think got rid of thousands of pioneers


[31-Mar-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The court has convened, 15 NCC tax is now in effect


[31-Mar-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	idk if SET should be higher, Tech going to 200-300 in exchange for tech immigration is an option


[31-Mar-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	also, maybe a higher WAR Fee


[31-Mar-22 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	not at 10ncc a unit


[31-Mar-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i mean as only 85 units are being used


[31-Mar-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	currently 85 units rented, so 100ncc unit which is standard I think, would generate 8500 a week in taxes


[31-Mar-22 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	would that be any much better compared to increasing production tax slightly


[31-Mar-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i am saying do both


[31-Mar-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah ok


[31-Mar-22 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	it all helps


[31-Mar-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	from what i think... production fees should be something like 20 35 80 180 400... or something like that with each tier getting higher


[31-Mar-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	then again i dont use anything other than pio


[31-Mar-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	how many higer tier workes do you have?  so this means if my tax rate on ALE is pretty hight, becasue I have to pay the PIO tax, the Sett tax


[31-Mar-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and for GIN it is even higher, remember those players with higher tier still have lower tier as well


[31-Mar-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Honestly just saying those numbers while looking at other planets, just wanted to say have something like an increase in production fees for the different tiers


[31-Mar-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The edu program reduced pioneers by 4000.   As I said before, running the planetary festivities program once or twice will help all tiers.  15NCC tax seems fine.  As long as it is enough for you to do upkeep on SS & INF plus a little bit on the PAR.


[31-Mar-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'd be open to paying you directly to spawn some higher tier workers.  Speaking of which, we're already short by 115 technicians so maybe you guys should slow down a little bit on constructing all these new tech buildings.


[31-Mar-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If my math is right the festivities would raise pioneer happiness to 85% and generate about 15k workers.


[31-Mar-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I am down to help however I can, but not building is not an option...lol...THE BOOZE MUST FLOW!!!  ha ha h ahah ah ah

**CapitanIncognito**:	Can taxes only be set to 0 in non-faction space?


[31-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Non-faction has a huge range, 0-29997 I believe


[31-Mar-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	@McGang not suggesting that you don't build. Just keep in mind that if you build too fast then there aren't enough workers to go around and everybody ends up with less than optimal productivity.


[31-Mar-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i just need to drop a few FER and 1 ORC, so not a lot


[31-Mar-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That won't be a problem since we still have excess settlers.  Though, that may change soon if @Spice doesn't do something about it.

[31-Mar-22 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	That is the max tax for pioneer, than settlers etc


[31-Mar-22 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I think taxing the Tec more to run programs is the best option, that way 1) only the people WITH tecs have any addition burdem


[31-Mar-22 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	It wont affect people with pioneers and settlers at all


[31-Mar-22 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Upkeeping the park is messy financially as there is no way to know what taxs come from which source, All I get is a total


[31-Mar-22 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The most important thing i need to know is: What tech buildings are you using, if its all orchard or a mix etc


[31-Mar-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ORC will be my only TEC building


[31-Mar-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and just 1


[31-Mar-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and if it runs without tech that is ok too


[31-Mar-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	it will make enuff on just settlers


[31-Mar-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	What is the cost to run the planetary festivities program?


[31-Mar-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	72k


[31-Mar-22 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	We can discuss and try and figure it out but im going to just raise taxs again, if its too high easy to fix, too low easy to fix


[31-Mar-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	( and figure out some ratios)


[31-Mar-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	How much would you need to raise taxes to get 72k?  I say, do that and run the PF program.  Then next week me and Hydroa will pay you directly to spawn some engineer.


[31-Mar-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The direct donations is easy but id prefer to do atleast cycle of experment


[31-Mar-22 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	As for the TEC building, I'm using about 1/4 of the planet workers with a mix of 5 different buildings.


[31-Mar-22 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	The taxs are split for the different pops so it should be fine


[31-Mar-22 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also WAR fees to 0, will go up if we are ANYWHERE near to running out but thats just not going to happen


[31-Mar-22 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	This all sounds very reasonable.


[31-Mar-22 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Im going to build more popi/ upkeep more popi btw, more tax isnt for fun


[31-Mar-22 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	Some of them can go.  Just have them drop off the drinking water supplies (tradesperson entrance please)


[31-Mar-22 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Actually, some of them are allowed to go and get some small measure of comfort  (to mix the image and the pop rules)


[31-Mar-22 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	(its what kills running higher tiers with larger pioneer populations)


[31-Mar-22 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I do like how programs can very easily target the 'price' of impacting specific pops


[31-Mar-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Only works cause we are a low tier planet tho


[31-Mar-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Hahaha Election time, what a great time to increases taxes slightly


[01-Apr-22 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You're supposed to lower taxes at election time.  And kiss our babies.  And offer us a chicken in every pot.


[01-Apr-22 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	What's the weekly income / expendature of planet capital @spice?


[01-Apr-22 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Your welcome to contact the Finance Ministry, the PM says no comment


[01-Apr-22 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	~~Embezzlement is just a number


[01-Apr-22 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I don't wanna be attacked by math nerds but tax is 120-140k


[01-Apr-22 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	changes


[01-Apr-22 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	expenditure is a good bit higher by  ~~40k ish but only because im building bigger buffers so it should drop soon


[01-Apr-22 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	oh i just had a great idea :)


[01-Apr-22 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	now we can put all the discussions behind us and get a very simple easy statistic


[01-Apr-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Why is the tax to 0?


[01-Apr-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@Spice wants to get the rough stats on the tech buildings here... thats what im seeing it as


[01-Apr-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	Tax the rich


[01-Apr-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kawaii_Douchebag**:	thats why


[01-Apr-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	were all trying to figure out how and who to tax


[01-Apr-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	So having a number just for techies would be very very usefull


[01-Apr-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Im 1) going to do more upkeep/build more SST INF, anyways


[01-Apr-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	2) then seeing how fast techs leave ( they will never be happy i think) tells us exactly how often we should run the tech immigration program


[01-Apr-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	My geuss is rougly every 2 or 3 weeks, meaning tech taxs should add up to16k - 25k


[01-Apr-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	imo tech tax is probably going to end up in the 50-100 range

[03-Apr-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	This is just my opinion, but you should be collecting rent from the WAR, not sure how many TECH buildings we have, but in the case of my ORC I am going to drop in the next week or so that would be 100ncc every 1.5 days or 460ish a week.  we have 500ish Techs on planet, guessing that we might have maybe 20 Tech Buildings to base production tax off of using my numbers, that is $9300 a week, so not bad, but if you raise the WAR fee from ZERO to $100 at current usage that is an extra $8500 to ad to the pot, so that is approx 17.5K a week added to the coffers


[03-Apr-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	that math assumes &100 tech tax, and my ORC running  at 100% speed, and it will not be running at 100%...lol


[03-Apr-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Your taxed based on your %


[03-Apr-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	so if you run it half the time, or only have 50% efficiency you pay 1/2 the tax


[03-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	This tax period is gonna cost be a good chunk but its important because I have no idea at all how much tax comes from techs, would apprecitiate if you buildings running. Also if you stop your tech building that will pretty much permanently raise tech tax


[03-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	costs from me*


[03-Apr-22 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I'm not keen on increasing WAR cost, Verdant has alot of import/exports so traders/shippers need WAR


[03-Apr-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	anyone is welcome to pm me on discord, ALOT easier than planet chat. Just search spice on UFO


[03-Apr-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I imagine that a bunch of people renting WAR space took 2 units just because it is cheap.  If the price were raised then probably several of those units would be returned so there wouldn't be as much revenue anyway.


[03-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The fact that there are 213 available units despite the cheap price means there isn't a whole lot of demand for WAR space.


[03-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	If we got anywhere near running out I would but the benifits of everyone having WAR is 100% helpful to everyone


[03-Apr-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	even just the 1k extra space could mean you dont need STO


[03-Apr-22 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Good thinking.   Anything that makes it easier for people to come to Verdant, stay here, and grow their base means more tax revenue.  Likely more than would be collected from higher WAR prices.


[03-Apr-22 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	I think it would help just selling argi stuff on lm too


[03-Apr-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I've actually started buying agri stuff from the LM and shut down a couple of my farms.


[03-Apr-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	... Even though I just got my 5th Agri expert.   It's funny but I've been on Verdant from the start but don't use any of the Agri experts.


[03-Apr-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-22 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	All engineers have been hired (in fact, there are open jobs now due to migration) so you'd be getting just the 1 scientist.  Since WAI is now available on the market it isn't worth it to build a building for just 1 scientist since we don't have the infrastructure to acquire more.  Of course, at any time you could give @spice some cash and have him spawn some scientists.

[04-Apr-22 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-22 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-22 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-22 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-22 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Settler happiness will probably be above 30% tomorrow.    With the Festivities next week and more POPI that should stop the bleeding and we will have about 400-500 reserves.

[07-Apr-22 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Apr-22 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	So last week education in/out was 0 on every planet.  As far as this week,  I think worker happiness plays a factor so I don't know if your estimates are correct but what we got doesn't seem all that out of whack to me.


[07-Apr-22 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Next week, should see some growth in pioneers & settlers thanks to the festifities program.  Tech & engineer should at least stop declining if not increase a bit.

**Hydroa**:	True Pioneer happiness is above 70%. If we maintain the same rate of PIO upkeep, in a few weeks we'll naturally get more.


[07-Apr-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Actually, we should get ~1.3k migration this next report, and ~1.3 education out for an almost stable population (if there are no more bugs)


[07-Apr-22 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Might gain or lose 1k pios total depending on unemployment numbers


[07-Apr-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	@Spice is running the festivities program this week which bumps up happiness by 20% so we will get a lot more than 1300 pioneers.

[08-Apr-22 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Apr-22 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Just a though of mine, would it be a possible good idea to make the planet upkeeps a buy from you bods


[15-Apr-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	bid


[15-Apr-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	right now im just privatly buying stuff and shipping it over, but buying upkeep from people here sounds more fun


[15-Apr-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	you mean like what Vallis does for upkeep stuff?


[15-Apr-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	anything that you can source locally will make it easier to manage upkeep.


[15-Apr-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yes. Easier and potentially cheaper than buying on the open market, IMO.


[15-Apr-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yes! Plz!  Put Buy ads on LM for Upkeep!  Set Prices below what you'd pay at CX, but not too low.  I'd gladly take lower profits to support POPI.


[15-Apr-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-22 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Dec is an option but its a good bit more expensive


[16-Apr-22 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also nothing so complicated as the vallis stuff, Im looking for SUN, FOD, PFE, TUB and STR


[16-Apr-22 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	DDEC isnt worth it unless we have more PAR imo


[16-Apr-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also if anyone can get 7 HAB over for par upgrade ill buy it


[16-Apr-22 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Sorry for spam, Might as well add RAT, DW, MCG, PE too the buy list


[16-Apr-22 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'll probably put up a UPF in a few weeks.  I could work on the HABs then.  If you really want the DEC I could make some of that too.


[16-Apr-22 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It seems some of the other planets have scaled back their upkeep and just run the Festivities program every week to keep their population stable.


[16-Apr-22 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Then there's Circe which completely stopped Comfort, Culture and Education upkeep in order to get rid of their 800 or so surplus of scientists.


[16-Apr-22 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Nah to the Dec, Verdant could do with a bit of development its pretty behind


[16-Apr-22 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Our unemplyment is pretty low


[16-Apr-22 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	What is your target for an ideal unemployment level?


[16-Apr-22 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	honestly 8-12% would seem decent to me, but then again we don't get many new players settling everyday and the reserve pool is still looking fine

[16-Apr-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Yes Steam launch will bring in a few more people but compared to other starter planets I predict that Verdant will not see as big of an increase, because the warning about being a little far from MOR will deter most new players.


[16-Apr-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	its far but i produce RAT and DW here for all my planets


[16-Apr-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	and all O for my SME


[16-Apr-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	beacouse Promitor its out of land. I thing Verdant its next


[16-Apr-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	Same, just that new players have a lower chance of actually choosing here to start. Some might choose here as 2nd or 3rd base but not as part of the initial wave for 1st base.


[16-Apr-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**KostisPlayz**:	@realbandit Thanks dude for the Warehouse contributions!


[16-Apr-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	Promitor is not really full, its just gonna keep piling up with ghostplots for new players


[16-Apr-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	the impact will come from all the newbies starting in Moria who will want DW/RAT.  It is cheaper to ship this in from Verdant than Promitor, especially for H2O/DW where Verdent beats Promitor in both H2O extraction and distance to market


[16-Apr-22 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Etherwind will play nicely (again) for DW, but cant compete for RAT


[16-Apr-22 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Hmm


[16-Apr-22 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nocknuck**:	well and you can make it in a PP2


[17-Apr-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Apr-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	Actually, most of the resources were purchased between the 5 and 7 of this month for the SME and the necessary HB1.


[17-Apr-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Apr-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	In a couple weeks - after I repair my old POLs, I'll start making some.


[18-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It would help (at least, it will help me) if you post for 48FOD instead of 50 since production is in increments of 16.


[20-Apr-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	are we gonna extend that upkeep list to cover some of the more common stuff like CoGC needs or do those already have arrangements.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'd say it was good timing running that Festivities program a couple weeks ago.  Now we have plenty of pioneers and settlers for all the new bases.


[20-Apr-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	At last count, 9 new bases on Verdant today which is a 6.7% increase.


[20-Apr-22 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	i expect a good amount of people choosing verdant as second or third base in the moria area


[20-Apr-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	imo its a pretty useful third planet


[20-Apr-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	honestly I expected more people to start here, but they all seemed to choose Prom


[20-Apr-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	same


[20-Apr-22 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	oooo just realised fuel prices should shoot down, selling all your fuel is a huge benifit as a new player


[20-Apr-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Also apologies for the MASSIVE spam in the lm, F is goods for the planet, the list will be alot shorter in the future as i want to fill up the reserves. I think all the prices are reassonable or even too high but if someone thinks anyone of them are too low go ahead and say so


[20-Apr-22 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Someone bought up most of the RAT.NC1... and then dumped it all.  Current spread is 88NCC (would be higher but I listed a bit of food at the dirt cheap price of 158).


[20-Apr-22 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	So now the question is, do I feed my own workers or take advantage of the insane prices?


[20-Apr-22 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	that was me


[20-Apr-22 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Umm, I'm trying to pick up one of your orders on the LM but when I click it it says "No ad found".


[20-Apr-22 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	you on the steam version now? I've had issues with the LM not updating and having to switch screens


[20-Apr-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	No, not steam.  It seems to be just the FOD orders.  Did someone already get them and they're still listed on the LM?


[20-Apr-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I see one still there


[20-Apr-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Not just FOD.  Some orders work and some don't.


[20-Apr-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I see three listed and I tried all of them.


[20-Apr-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	refresh and look again?


[20-Apr-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Refreshed.  Those three are gone now and I just see the one that you see.


[20-Apr-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	if on the PAR is full, do you think that will be enough for Pioneer + settler growth, and atleast tech and engi not leaving


[20-Apr-22 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	than occasional festival to get more of all of them


[20-Apr-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Right now happiness for all tiers is near 50% and as long as there isn't high unemployment it shouldn't drop too much.  You could probably get away with cutting POPI upkeep in half and just run the festivities every 2-3 weeks.


[20-Apr-22 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	But I guess a lot depends on whether the big Steam influx is a short term thing or a regular occurence.


[20-Apr-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spice**:	Become the festival planet


[20-Apr-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Are you telling me an Einsteinium Enrichment plant isn't considered resource extraction?


[21-Apr-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Wakanda**:	Weird - I start a rig to collect water - the next day I start a farm. Yesterday I got my "Agriculture Expert" - but I haven't god a "Resource Extraction Expert" yet - although the rig i s a day older than the farm. ? - Have anyone tried the same, or is it just a bug


[25-Apr-22 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Experts appear based on accumulated production.   So, they always appear right after a production run completes.   The rig may have a longer production run going that didn't complete before them farm did.


[25-Apr-22 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	ok - thx


[25-Apr-22 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Also, calculation factors in total production for that type.  So if you have 2 agriculture buildings but only 1 extraction building then the agriculture expert will come faster.

[27-Apr-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KostisPlayz**:	The INC is also working nearly full tiome


[27-Apr-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	what do you consider building types? industries or just the actual building


[27-Apr-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Are we talking about the peepee poopoos?


[27-Apr-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Kostis - what do you mean by "companies {you} have acquired"?


[27-Apr-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I mean I bought companies


[27-Apr-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	A player can sell their whole Company?


[27-Apr-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	It's more of a "I tell you which buildings to make and sell from while I get a 30% cut of your profits"


[27-Apr-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Because they get to keep all of their assets after the time that has been agreed upon.


[27-Apr-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	I.e. It could just a month were I have control over the company


[27-Apr-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wakanda**:	So you only got 1 planet then


[27-Apr-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	No after they have completely maxed their base on their planet, they go and extract other resources from other planets and sell it.


[27-Apr-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	That's basically what the Hellenic Galactic Republic idea was.


[27-Apr-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Ah, you're not really "buying" a company, just "renting" control.


[27-Apr-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KostisPlayz**:	Yes


[27-Apr-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	so what is it good for?


[01-May-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ask the different corps themselves, no two corps run things exactly the same


[01-May-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	No special benefits, other than a chat in game, probably a Discord. Possibly helpful guildmates giving you shipping contracts and the like.

[01-May-22 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	But the 10% HQ bonus is only on the planet that the HQ is, isn't it?

[01-May-22 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	I wonder where exactly I see the overall efficiency of my production, and all the bonuses.


[01-May-22 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	On production -> details I see my oxygen collector has 104% overall efficiency.


[01-May-22 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	That suggests I get the 4% bonus of the planet, but no HQ bonus.


[01-May-22 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	doesn't break down by each bonus, but under production lines --> details; it will show total effeciency of your workers and production line


[01-May-22 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	... just go to new order on a specific production line...


[01-May-22 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	that breaks down all the % factors


[01-May-22 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	"Corporation Headquarters are the first project a newly founded corporation has to build in order to function properly. Headquarters have to be built on a planet outside faction space and will provide a 10% production boost for all members on that planet."


[01-May-22 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	your company (individual) HQ is NCC faction, so you don't get a bonus on resource extraction


[01-May-22 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	My rig and collector show 4% company HQ bonus, but no corp HQ bonus.


[01-May-22 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	verdant is not ncc faction


[01-May-22 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	and they haven't updated the list of restricted planets for corporation HQ since they expanded the starter planet list.  I could create a corporate HQ on verdant, which is now a starter planet


[01-May-22 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	verdant is under 'no faction'


[01-May-22 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**AmAnBear**:	Corp HQ that is


[01-May-22 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	Yeah Corp HQ is just for the planet it is on. Your personal HQ gives bonuses on all planets


[01-May-22 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	so that might be the confusion


[01-May-22 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	addendum - personal company HQ gives bonus to all bases in the same faction space.  Also, those bonuses are higher when you have more {unused} base permits -- you get an additional permit each time you level your HQ.  If you don't apply that permit to a base then your "unused" permit count will be higher and thus the company HQ bonus will be higher.  That bonus will go up/down any time you use or free up a permit.


[01-May-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Direx**:	my company HQ is on a non-faction planet, and I get the bonus on my bases in Benten space. I think the HQ bonus is universal


[01-May-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	company HQ bonus is universal, corporation HQ bonus is on that planet with HQ only. full stop. :D

[01-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	molp also acknowledged the following bug from Apr 2020 "When building a new base on a planet that already has a Corporate Headquarters, you do not receive the corporate headquarters production bonus."


[01-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	this implies that building a new base on another planet should get the corporation bonus

**IDKanything**:	i think that actually implies that you need to have a base on the planet first before the corp HQ is built to get the 10% bonus


[01-May-22 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	not that building on another planet should get the bonus


[01-May-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	also yea i agree that sentence in the handbook can be read both ways... but its supposed to mean all the bases on that planet with the corp HQ who is owned by a member of that corp gets the bonus


[01-May-22 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i think that bug is already fixed anyways with how EFIO operates


[01-May-22 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Any member of the corp can build the HQ. Once built, any corp member with a base on that planet gets the 10% bonus, but only on that planet.

**CPY**:	selling C cheaper than NX on LM


[06-May-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	*cheaper than in CX


[06-May-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	400 each isn't really a discount considering the last trade on the CX was 395.


[06-May-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	well it was 450 yesterday


[06-May-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	C traded in the 300.53 to 500.0 range yesterday.  A single point in time trade is not a great indicator of current value.


[06-May-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	The 10 day SMA (simple moving average) for C is currently 361.20


[06-May-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	Add on a (generous for this direction) 10 NCC/max for shipping, and at 2.25t, the average cost of buying C on market and shipping to Verdant over the last 10 days would be 383.70 NCC per unit of C.  Anything under this price is good value.


[06-May-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	Although, at a 17.3% markup on this price (450/unit), this is not unreasonable to ship in a stock a product for resale (average markup for stocked products in my real world industry is 18%)


[06-May-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Umm... why would you add shipping costs to Verdant


[06-May-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This is a great place to grow burnables and has low demand for C


[06-May-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's more likely that C is being exported rather than imported


[06-May-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I'll buy it


[06-May-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'll need some here eventually to smelt iron


[06-May-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and by here I mean on the next planet over


[06-May-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	My point was that 450/unit was not an unreasonable price if it was shipped in from the CX.  Local producers would have a lower cost basis and should be able to undercut that (significantly).  I sold my last batch of C at 300/u


[06-May-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	and that was the delivery price to YI-280


[06-May-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I figure any shipment should have a 4.14NCC min added base on weight or volume(multiply) which ever is higher for CX(Mor) comparisons (Note Im not calculating repairs)


[06-May-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	so subtracting that from CX avg on LM it should always sell but hey there a reason to have a time limit/can cancel ads one can alway adjust if it doesn't sell


[06-May-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	one of the great things about 0 LM fees.  You can experiment with prices and leave it up for a while.


[06-May-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah Im so happy I liq first company and moved here


[06-May-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	that's what I did too.  YI is a greatly under-appreciated sector


[06-May-22 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I think it real helps starting/small companies get there feet under them


[06-May-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	it good for me cause I'm aggressively expanding I never really have any cash


[06-May-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CPY**:	i wonder is there a company with HQ on verdant? for 10% production bonus?


[06-May-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I think as a starter planet you are not allowed to place a Corporate HQ on Verdant.


[06-May-22 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	only the original starter planets no?


[07-May-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	technically Verdant was not a starter planet until later on in the universe from what I learnt


[07-May-22 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	So if we could have a corp HQ here then why haven't we done it?


[07-May-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	It'd be /your/ crop who builds it


[07-May-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	not a planetary project


[07-May-22 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	What I meant was, there are plenty of players not currently in a corp who could form one specifically to build a HQ on Verdant.


[07-May-22 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	New players don't have the funds to complete a Corporate HQ quickly.  Doesn't mean that there aren't any Corp HQ currently under construction on Verdant


[07-May-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Are there currently Corp HQs under construction on Verdant?


[07-May-22 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	CORPS YIC


[07-May-22 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	will show a corporate HQ unfinished on Verdant


[07-May-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Ah.   I would have done that months ago but I was led to believe that a corp HQ couldn't be build here.


[07-May-22 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I just went through the whole list of corporations.  Looks like SMBAS also started construction of a corp HQ here.

[17-May-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-May-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Bossqiutoes - like mosquitoes, but the size of a (large) human hand, with extra wings.


[18-May-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Dumbos - big (1-3 meter) balloons, with "earwings"; internal methane lets them float around (...they eat BEA...).


[18-May-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	GiAnts - like really big Earth ants, up to 1 meter long; 3-6 spherical segments, each 5-20 cm diameter, lotsa armlegs.  They travel in "troops" of 10-100, and they can eat a lot of crops.

**CPY**:	real nasty stuff


[19-May-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	DDT is considered to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical, or an EDC, a category of chemicals that researchers find particularly worrisome because of evidence that they alter and disrupt hormones important to good health, including reproductive health, as well as neurological and immune functions.


[19-May-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Konvolut**:	Some of my Pios like to cook GiAnts.  They rip the legs off & use those to start a fire.


[23-May-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Then they take the head, stick a Spinner inside, & blend up everything in there, and just put the head on the fire (the carapace isn't flamable, so it works as a cookpot).


[23-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	The result is like a cross between Gumbo & Hot-Sour Soup, but kinda purplish-grey.  The texture is terrible - like mucous mixed with dust - and the taste is a bit too, uh, acrid for me.


[23-May-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Usually if you nudge the slider just above bare minimum you will get a significant reduction in travel time for only a little more fuel.  In any case, I will extend if it doesn't get delivered in time.

**Konvolut**:	Large batches of new players cause short-term Inflation: they start with free Money, and  push up demand for lotsa T1 Mats.


[17-Jun-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	By now, those players are producing plenty of T1 & T2 Mats, and the extra supply would bring down prices for those things.

[25-Jun-22 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThatOneHuman**:	Wait no i'm not thinking of steel


[26-Jun-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	well carbon is used to make FEO into FE and then its just FE and O to make STL


[26-Jun-22 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	so Verdent would be a good place to make STL given the O in the air and the ablity to supply C on site


[26-Jun-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	shipping the O and C off Verdant is much easier than shipping FE or FEO to Verdant


[26-Jun-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and its much better to ship the crops to make C and have an INC at smelting site instead of shipping C itself, no matter which recipe you use


[26-Jun-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	ah I see the O C are lighter together then the FEO


[26-Jun-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CPY**:	There are few jobs on shorter runs for 17500 then there are quite few for 12500 then there is ocasional 10000 and there are lot of qued deliveries for 9000, for 5k you'll have to wait A LOT to get in the line for shipment :P

[29-Jun-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah so the problem is that just barely doesn't cover fuel both ways so the need either a contract or a reason to go pick up at mor anyway there also the "expense" of not having your ship to consider


[29-Jun-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	FYI @spice, I'm planning to fire 10 engineers in a week or so.  Also, unless someone requests it for a new building, I think it is counterproductive to spawn more engineers.  It keeps unemployment high and happiness low which accelerates migration.  If we let unemployment settle around 5% then happiness will climb to around 50% and the engineer population will beome more stable.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	What day does your Pro expire?   Election starts in 6.5 days.  If you run before pro expires you can get elected for the next term.

**charlie-fox**:	So I just started, I've built a Rig, Farm, and Processor and have them churning H20, BEA, GRN, VEG, and RAT respectively. And I've just sent one of my ships to the commodity exchange.... is there anything else I can do while I wait the 12 or so hours for stuff to happen?


[16-Jul-22 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	familiarize with the market, plan out what you wanna do short/long term


[16-Jul-22 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	gameplay wise: Not that much rly :)


[16-Jul-22 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Should I have started on Moria rather than here away from the commodity market? Did I make a mistake choosing Verdant?


[16-Jul-22 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, I'd say start at pick cities as prom/moria, since there won't any other way to settle there but as picking it as started planet, since they are all filled up. But in the end, it's hard to anyone to say which is the Best course of action.


[16-Jul-22 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	start as picking cities*


[16-Jul-22 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	verdant is really good spot too though, since moria is close by and it really is needs for frm stuff


[16-Jul-22 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	for food, which ever you are doing


[16-Jul-22 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Hmm okay, I'll stick with being here then I guess! :)


[16-Jul-22 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	if you're into farming, you can't go wrong with prom. Though you gotta basicly ship your stuff to neighboring cxl's for good profit


[16-Jul-22 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Better than here in Verdant?


[16-Jul-22 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	oh sry i misread kek


[16-Jul-22 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well it is better, but it isn't That big diffrence


[16-Jul-22 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	so maybe the demand at moria do outweight the diffrence


[16-Jul-22 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	so yeh, if your gut feeling tells that verdant feels good, go for it ^_^


[16-Jul-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Well I'm here now so I guess it does feel good


[16-Jul-22 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yee I'd imagine verdant is solid for u. Since ye, you can't farm in Moria, and if you were in Prom, you would be shipping your stuff anyway to other cxl's


[16-Jul-22 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	you just need to plan a bit more ahead to make sure you won't run out of consumables, since cxl isn't right at your reach, but it shouldn't be that bad

[22-Jul-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	We don't need a governor.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.


[22-Jul-22 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	I'll fullfill the basics as governor until another candiate with grander ambitions want's to take over.


[22-Jul-22 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Farming aint for commune-ists.  That is a job for late stage capi-toil-ists.


[22-Jul-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	I agree that you can act as a act as a sort of executive-officer-for-the-week.  However, I insist that all decisions must be  ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting


[22-Jul-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, I guess I could run for the office. Could be a nice add up for staring these production queues


[22-Jul-22 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	not sure what it entails though. Is it just filling up the populations needs for consumables, picking right planetary programs and adjusting taxes?


[22-Jul-22 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	if that is all, ye, I'm sure I could manage it. Though will raise the taxes back up when the opportunity rises, I ain't gonna run this planet out of my own pocket :P


[22-Jul-22 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	as long as you don't refer to us as bloody peasants and start repressing us, I'm all for it


[22-Jul-22 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye unlikely, I'm mostly driven by compulsive need to please everyone xP


[22-Jul-22 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	which is tragic ofc, since I fail at it most of the time T_T


[22-Jul-22 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but ye, as a campaign, motto will be to listen the will of the directors, by running things as democratic as possible. Though those that have more investment on this planet, have more weight on in their votes :p


[22-Jul-22 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	We need governor who can keep bugs at bay.


[22-Jul-22 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well do we have any of the devs in this planet? ^_^'


[22-Jul-22 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	You don't need devs to keep bugs at bay you need proper spacer shotgun.


[22-Jul-22 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	Bugs as large as a truck. Or maybe it's that space fertilizer. You can never be sure.


[22-Jul-22 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, I guess I just keep throwing pioneers at them until they go away if nothing else


[22-Jul-22 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	so far it worked with minimal loses, plus pioneers breed like rabbits


[22-Jul-22 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	also... why the hell can't I ranch animals? This aint honest work without cattle ranch.


[22-Jul-22 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	we have green pastures, fresh water, fresh* air, where animals?


[22-Jul-22 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I guess the few that are left are assigned to wild parks


[22-Jul-22 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Animals? Who needs animals when we have bugs the size of horses?


[22-Jul-22 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	It's fine. They mostly only come out at night. Mostly.


[22-Jul-22 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but ye, with all that, if I'm the one to end up to this thankless job, I just ask ya all to help me, to help you. Like being active and vocal on suggesting which planetary program should be and all that.


[22-Jul-22 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	as a guy with less than 3 month old company, I feel humble as fuk to take this position. Even though likely making bigger deal than it really is ^_^'

**CPY**:	but you have 513 days registering date?


[22-Jul-22 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but ye, as a last note of me rambling for my campaign, just for all of you to know that being a dick pretty much invalidates all your chances on affecting on my decision making. I ain't getting rewarded enough here to thrown shit at me for anyone's leisure.


[22-Jul-22 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ofc being critical is all and good. But if you don't know the fine line between that, well, I'll let you know if you cross that line ^_^'


[22-Jul-22 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	im dick to everyone, i am all for equality


[22-Jul-22 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	BBh


[22-Jul-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	It's worthwhile if I only bring a small amount back? I was just going to sell them for the same price as the exchange if someone needed them to save a trip back


[22-Jul-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I figured if I didn't bring back enough to build an entire building, someone may as well go to the exchange and buy them themselves along with all the other parts they needed?


[22-Jul-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	You're right, worst case - I'll just use them myself anyway


[22-Jul-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Ooooooh okay didn't realise you could do that!


[22-Jul-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I was going to say, the other way you could do it is buy it yourself and make a shipping contract


[22-Jul-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I could do that if you perfer


[22-Jul-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Swordofdmslaying**:	If you find it profitable I'll pay upfront


[22-Jul-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I'll also buy PG in 100s


[22-Jul-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Oh no, the OFF and MCG are more expensive at the CX


[22-Jul-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I can bring PG back at cost price if you throw up a contract


[22-Jul-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Does anyone currently have some BBH at Verdant they can sell?


[22-Jul-22 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I think Shadows does, he just said he has 100 I think


[22-Jul-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Wasn't sure if he meant he had it here or somewher else.  I really only need 1 but I'd buy a bit more.

[27-Jul-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	are you referring to planetary infrastructure upkeep? most governors use the tax money to buy and supply those goods. but, verdant has been an exception where taxes are low/zero and the upkeep has been out of the gov's pocket


[27-Jul-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...and we are getting a new governor in a few days.


[27-Jul-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Anyone who want's to get involved with the governing of Verdant can post their questions or PM me. There will be taxes if we want cogc and other infrastructure upkeep'd. (Unless we have sponsors?) As i mentioned earlier I am willing to administer the basic upkeep. I'll keep it all open source. No fancy bidding module or fancy universitties. If anyone want to go bigger I urge them to colaborate or run them selves. Don

**Kuben**:	Dear friends of Verdant! I am afraid the tax haven handled by Mr Spice has ended, and we have to go back to some basics taxes. At the moment i made a copy of Promitor's tax leveles and startet the Planet Festivities III project. Anyone have an oponion can voice it here or DM me. The tax levels now is only to rebuild our coffers (Which does include 1m NCC from Spice, so make sure to give him his well deserved praise) When I have a better overview of our running costs and income I will make the necessary adjustment.

[30-Jul-22 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	Whilst I have no objections to resetting taxes to pay for the programs needed, setting taxes based upon a faction space planet is not a fair comparison


[30-Jul-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	LM and WH fees will kill all local trade


[30-Jul-22 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	Verdant is currently the defacto trade centre for the whole sector.  Anyone can rent a WH and post/accept on LM, encouraging nearby settlements to trade here instead of shipping to the CX.  No one is going to post an ad unless they already have a buyer lined up


[30-Jul-22 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	RIP LM


[30-Jul-22 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	maybe I've got used to proms taxes, but aren't you guys exaggerating a bit? I would imagine fuel being much bigger factor on flight patterns than lm/wh fees


[30-Jul-22 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	one of the biggest attractions for Verdant was that it was outside of faction space and not subject to the min tax levels dictated by the factions.  The new verdant LM fess are higher than Montem and Vallis


[30-Jul-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	What do you sugest for the LM?


[30-Jul-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	I don't have a problem with the production fees as this tax supports the programs that keep the workers.  However, I only buy/sell on LMs where the fees are zero and the WH's are free.


[30-Jul-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	I will move my buy/sells to either YI-280 or Arcadia (which is only 1 jump away)


[30-Jul-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	I am open to return the LM and WH fee to zero, and possibly adjust the production tax if the income is not sufficient.


[30-Jul-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	there is no ongoing cost to maintain LMs or WHs, so they are more of an infrastructure thing to encourge trade


[30-Jul-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	It has been a really healthy LM having no fees here, historically it has promoted a lot of trade on planet. Adjusting production fees to cover taxes would be my strategy in that position


[30-Jul-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Any other objections before I change? Since there looks to be a limit to how often I can do that.


[30-Jul-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	I'll leave it be for a couple of hours, then I change the LM and WH fees to 0.


[30-Jul-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Pending no objections etc etc


[30-Jul-22 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	pretty sure there will be, but only after you've made the changes ^_^'


[30-Jul-22 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	There are topics like running COGC specific tax structures, etc. but I think using taxes to justify keeping the trade free is a good spot to be


[30-Jul-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	most of the WH upgrades were not paid by taxes, but by companies that wanted extra space on the planet to facilitate their trading


[30-Jul-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	We are now at WH level 7, which allows up to 4 warehouses per company (2k total).  And are WH is only at 12% full


[30-Jul-22 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	You could make an argument for warehouse fees if we were running out of warehouses to rent and these fees were to be used to pay for further warehouse upgrades.  But that is not the case on Verdant at the moment


[30-Jul-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	you seem to have a pretty good grasp on things :), maybe you should've have run for governorship too?


[30-Jul-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Let's not forget our common enemy here. The bugs. We are in it together!


[30-Jul-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	I was thinking of running on another planet and you can only hold 1 governship at a time.  I "almost" put my hand up but then Kuben volunteered.  And I think he's doing a great job except for the LM and WH fees.


[30-Jul-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	But if he feels this is the best way to manage the planet, I'd accept that and run against him at the next election on a pro-trade platform


[30-Jul-22 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kosimo**:	I'm also pro-bugs


[30-Jul-22 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-22 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I just feed em out of malice, "in secret"


[30-Jul-22 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-22 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jul-22 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Swordofdmslaying**:	I know I supreme destroying overlord state a plan to repeal the LM free but I also agree that the 0 fee is very important and would rather have higher taxs... has nothing to do with the copious amount of LM ad I put up :p


[30-Jul-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	honestly I fine a fee on numbers of day up more annoying then the one time fee... don't know if that's just me

**charlie-fox**:	As a small business owner, the taxes are annoying all round for me however I agree that anything which promotes trade on world is good. I've found the active LM to be more beneficial to me than the what I'm now losing in taxes.


[30-Jul-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	To clarify, I do understand the reason for taxes, and am not complaining about what is necessary. Just annoying since tax haven was all I've known in this game so far! ...my spreadsheets don't even have a column for taxes yet!

[11-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	usually that is not preferable


[11-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	flying to hubur is not a single burn trip, i would advise selling back what you bought there


[11-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it will cost 3x the fuel to get to hubur as to moria


[11-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutieBoy2005**:	Can I sell without a ship being there?


[11-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yep, you'll need to rent a warehouse and then you can claim the goods in the CONT menu


[11-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	once theyre in the warehouse you can relist and sell them


[11-Aug-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutieBoy2005**:	And how would I rent a warehouse?


[11-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Aug-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutieBoy2005**:	How do I move the filled orders to the warehouse?


[11-Aug-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	in the contracts menu, you can pick up the goods


[11-Aug-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	they will go directly to the warehouse


[11-Aug-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutieBoy2005**:	very cool


[11-Aug-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	keep in mind when you resell them, you'll need to sell them to the ask price if you want them to sell immediately


[11-Aug-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	(and that might be at a loss)


[11-Aug-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Aug-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Aug-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Nobody seems to care much about "Factions".  I've actually forgotten what they're called; I just think of them by their Currency (NCC vs ICA, etc), becuase that's the only aspect of Faction that seems to matter.

[18-Aug-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Our weekly upkeep is about 400k - so with program arround 500k. I've invested about 2m NCC in filling up our reserves for upkeep. And the last tax income was 460k. (Anyone who wants can get access to my terrible sheet :) ) So I sugest we leave the tax levels as is and have a break in programs. This will allow us to keep LM and WH free.

[30-Aug-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valice**:	It's not a bad idea to max out your first base before starting a second one imo


[07-Sep-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kuben**:	Hello! With election starting I figured I'd give a update. With no projects running we have had a surplus the last few weeks. At the moment our cash deficit is arround 660k and should take three more weeks to cover. However we do have a nice Inventory of upkeep goods at almost 3m and a minimum resserve of 30 days. I see there are som open Engineer jobs in the POPR, and a project for Engineer Imigration costs 80k, which I think is a bit expensive from the tax purse for 3 open jobs. If you have any questions or sugestion feel free to ask or dm me. Hope you all are healthy and prosperous!

[16-Sep-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	That's a lot of trades to keep the taxes organized, as they will default to paying out all 3 members, just so you're aware


[16-Sep-22 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	It's two trades per week.


[16-Sep-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	The local market doesn't have actual stock - not the the CX. It's more like a bulletin board where people pin buy/sell ads, like used tractors for sale, news of the monthly square dance competition, and photos of lost pets.

[18-Sep-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	So I make every need for day to day operations so my costs arent in flux so if I can sell on LM below ask I do, I also figure in there a discount I can apply from not having to ship to CX


[18-Sep-22 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	my game "plan" isn't make number go up as fast a possible. I'm seeing if I can drive the trade toward YI and help promote development in the area by having better deals on Verdant for locals then going to CX


[18-Sep-22 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	honestly my ROI is on the sad side (Im just over 1 million which is quite small I believe with half that in cash atm) but I've never gone down in value


[18-Sep-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	now obliviously I stop selling if I'm not making a profit margin I don't like which is why I stop making DW surplus for a while cause DW was being sold for to low on planet I also try not to step into any "markets" on planet so I general dont sell extraction good or base agi given thats the base for the verdent eco and instead focus on goods that either support those bases like OVE or I hope trade incentives like gas that can be picked up here rather then a CX honestly I make basically nothing on that fuel (I mean I do but like a 1-2 NCC a u is tiny an mostly destroyed by operations/taxes)


[18-Sep-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	the short version is: I make everything I need to operate and sell on planet and use the savings in operation and shipping cost to undersell the market rather then make big bucks


[18-Sep-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	making me a the odd player I assume


[18-Sep-22 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	I think the bugs are evolving a resistance to DDT. The carried off one of my PIO last week. It was tragic - his loss slowed down production on Bean Farm #5.We may need to resort to stronger stuff soon.

[23-Sep-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	DDT gets Bossquitoes drunk; kills them, eventually, but they only attack humans when drunk.  Sucked one of my Pio's dry last year.  Use DDT sparingly - no puddles - and keep the containers covered.

[28-Sep-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	why are the margin poor ?  - You have productionprice for RAT under 10 NCC each before transportation and market  price is 80 ?


[28-Sep-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	And you can have 2.380 in each run --> 190.000 NCC selling at moria


[28-Sep-22 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KallyD**:	Each water is worth 30 coupons, each food unit to go into rations is worth 130~, processing them into rations only adds about 50 coupons of value per minute

[13-Oct-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I generally offer my contracts at 8/t to Moria, sometimes 10 if I need it quickly and it usually gets picked up within s couple days. It's enough that it covers a fair share of fuel and wear and tear. I keep my shipments small though so someone can squeeze it in among their own stuff


[13-Oct-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	And that 8/t is based on paying for an empty return trip.


[13-Oct-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Since most ships seem to return with a mostly empty cargo hold because demand for MOR-VER is so low, it would probably be less than 8/t I imagine?


[13-Oct-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kuben**:	Good day, Verdant! I pray to the prosperous gods that all your fields are green, and that bug-caused casualties had limited impact on your production. To give you all an update. The tax income was 543k last week. It's been growing steady every week, which means Verdant is growing. :) The weekly upkeep is just shy of 430k a week. Our current inventory value is 2,5m. I will reduce the buys, in order to lower the inv buffer to 30 days and free up cash. Apart from a high unemployment rate of settlers, we have good happiness. Planetary Festivities would be effective if we need a pio population boost soon. I would like to hear the peoples input on the further development of population infrastructure, programs and/or tax cuts?


[15-Oct-22 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Things appear to look good overall.  I think a healthy range for pioneer unemployment is around 10-15%.   Despite low happiness and high unemployment settlers keep showing up.  I don't think there is much that can be done unless you are able to institute The Purge.   I finally got the last engineer I needed and their happiness has stabilized so I am happy.

[16-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I can't help but notice that my building that is at 80% condition will cost almost 2/3 of it's original building cost to repair which doesn't seem economical


[16-Oct-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	yes - some time it better to take them down and rebuild


[16-Oct-22 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	There is no difference between demolish/rebuild vs repair.  You will end up spending the same amount of materials to end up with a 100% condition building.


[16-Oct-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	But my point is, my buildings have deteriorated less than 25% yet cost almost 75% of their original cost to repair / rebuild?


[16-Oct-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Even though the condition of your building is 80% you would only get back 1/3 of the materials by demolishing.


[16-Oct-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Should I be waiting for them to deterioate to almost 25% condition before I rebuild?

***Ogrebeef-Backkicker** deleted this message.*


[16-Oct-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Rule of thumb is, if materials are divisible by 2 (ie 4 BSE, 4 BDE) then repair after 90 days.  Otherwise, repair after 60 days.


[16-Oct-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	But to reiterate, don't look at building condition to calculate repair cost.  Just look at it to know that it is time to repair.   Buildings degrade faster as time goes on.  After 180 days I think condition gets down to 20% and repair cost=rebuild cost.  But even then, there is no difference in cost to you to repair vs rebuild.  Either way you are spending the same amount of materials to get a 100% building.


[16-Oct-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Oh and to be clear on that rule of thumb, I'm talking about the materials needed to build, not repair.   For example, a FRM takes 4 BSE and 4 BBH to build so you would repair it after 90 days.  A FP takes 3 each of BSE, BBH & BDE so you would repair that after 60 days.


[16-Oct-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If you want to know specifically how the game calculates repair cost, divide 180 by the number of each material needed to build.  That will tell you how many days it takes for the repair cost to go up by 1.  For example, FRM needs 4 BSE, 4BBH & 120 MCG to build.  Divide 180 by those numbers and yousee that every 45 days the repair cost goes up by 1 for BSE & BBH.    Every 1.5 days the cost of MCG goes up by 1.


[16-Oct-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	... I don't think they go by fractions so the MCG probably increases by 2 every 3 days.

[17-Oct-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I'll take it I use H20 faster then I produce it


[17-Oct-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	that I have a storage fac so picking it up for long term is smart move


[17-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	thanks for taking the water - I usually don't have much excess but my ships have been off doing other stuff and this base tends to generate more volume/weight than it consumes.


[17-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I guess I should build a STO... it would take some of the pressure off. the WAR space here is kind of small...

[22-Oct-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Matte_123**:	greetings, do you have a suggestion for a beginner if it is easier to upgrade the space of the first base or to set up new ones for each permit?


[19-Jan-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	it depends :3


[19-Jan-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll let @rento247 explain, they're more experienced


[19-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	wow, thanks for the pressure ^_^'


[19-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I could do it too


[19-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but it might take a long time


[19-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	because I need to hear what their plans are


[19-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but ye, for me, I upgraded my first base twice, because in that time PSL was really scarce, so it would've taken ages to haul money for second base


[19-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	and it worked really we'll for me


[19-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well=we'll


[19-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but, atleast now there's plenty PSL to go around, so that isn't really a factor


[19-Jan-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but I'd say upgrading your first base is a safe plan, so that you have a solid ground beneath you financially, before trying out other planets/industries


[19-Jan-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	also FRM-products atm are hot commodity right now in the cxl's, so there's that too ^_^'

[19-Jan-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Also how do people manage to pull off smelting FEO and selling it for 352?


[19-Jan-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	must be from their own production


[19-Jan-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I can get it even cheaper. The main cost is the transport. Like Vallis->Verdant adds ~100 of shipping cost to FE.


[19-Jan-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So, selling from Vallis to CX? Yep, 350 is totally profitable.


[19-Jan-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	*locally


[19-Jan-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I struggle supplying LST to Vallis to make my bfabs


[19-Jan-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I will not disclose my sources


[19-Jan-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	and produce my own FE for ~170


[19-Jan-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Even after imports, I still make a healthy 50+% margin


[19-Jan-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and plus, it helps the local economy grow


[19-Jan-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	350 doesn't seem totally profitable when you were used to getting 420-480 each, but there is still some profit, at this price though I am moving away from selling FE and now have more PP1s, a BMP, and an FS to use more of it up on site.

**DogeConomy**:	"Support Local Businesses"


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I started game on Vallis producing FE but biggest problem is how many you can put on 500t ship, so I moved to making bfabs


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah cheap FE is bad for the metallurgists


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(their profits)


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	my start was very slow


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm going to move later to danakil where there's a 25% CoGC production bonus


[19-Jan-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Wyper7 same


[19-Jan-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	unfortunately I've made it too deep in the game to abruptly coliq


[19-Jan-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so I can't start at Montem, the ultimate starter planet for Bfabs


[19-Jan-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	This is also why my production is at verdant


[19-Jan-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	why is montem good for bfabs?


[19-Jan-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	Morning all


[19-Jan-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	morning


[19-Jan-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@wyper7 do more market research


[19-Jan-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You've been in the Bfab game longer than I've been in it


[19-Jan-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I would like to settle montem for plastics


[19-Jan-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	not possible as of now


[19-Jan-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	sadly


[19-Jan-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	do you need a hint as to why montem is the best starter planet for Bfabs?


[19-Jan-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	reason why I like Vallis for bfabs more than Montem is that FE is more heavy than LST


[19-Jan-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	montem has both


[19-Jan-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	and bonus efficiency for neither


[19-Jan-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you don't have to pay any markups


[19-Jan-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	more resistant to price changes


[19-Jan-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what if the "water king" aka Niegrozny targeted ores and minerals next?


[19-Jan-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	he will target C next he said


[19-Jan-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah, just an example


[19-Jan-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	what wil he do to c?


[19-Jan-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Pump the price probably, I;m guessing


[19-Jan-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	if he survives this water apocalypse


[19-Jan-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	alright gtg


[19-Jan-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	cya


[19-Jan-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	bye


[19-Jan-23 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I do my BFABs on Vallis and import the LST.  I will continue to buy LST and FLX for a really long time.


[19-Jan-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	same here. deciding on the next move - but for now it does not look like it is a base for lst or flx


[19-Jan-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	well C price is already pumped up so ... hard to imagine it going much higher


[19-Jan-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	maybe more steel and then finally something with settlers - avoid them for now


[19-Jan-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	since I import LST already I just started making my own FLX there


[19-Jan-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also making my own C


[19-Jan-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	C i also make myself - FLX would require a settler level building


[19-Jan-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	and when I finish building Verdant I will supply my own O and fuel for INC


[19-Jan-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and i am not there yet - avoiding more complex supply chains


[19-Jan-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I've been making my vown C since almost the beginning ,,, it was my largest initial expense ... then it was the inputs for the INC, which actually is why I am here on Verdant now


[19-Jan-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you can run settler building if it has PIO workers without settlers


[19-Jan-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	really? what efficiency?


[19-Jan-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	CHP needs 20PIO and 60SET, so using only PIO it would work at 25%


[19-Jan-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	that may be a way - getting the LSI and making my own flx at least for some time


[19-Jan-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	also I know this is a long shot but I will be going Verdant to Vallis in about 2.5 hrs with about 200t of available shipping space


[19-Jan-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	I would be fine if he kept messing with water personally :)


[19-Jan-23 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	well I'm going heavy with RIGs cos water prices


[19-Jan-23 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	My next build package here will include two more RIGs so I am all for the H2O prices staying high


[19-Jan-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I got my BSE and BBH quantities mixed up. Does anyone have 4 BSE spare?


[19-Jan-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i m heavy on h20 because i need them for my farms ;)


[19-Jan-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I have no BFABs on Verdant .. Doge makes them here.  I only ever bring in exactly what I need for my next build package.


[19-Jan-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	same


[19-Jan-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you may want some local reserves for repairs


[19-Jan-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	repairs are far away


[19-Jan-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	how often do people repair anway?


[19-Jan-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	The sweet spot is around when condition drops to 85%


[19-Jan-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I will do the same when it is time to repair (way far away here on Verdant) and bring in exactly what I need for the repairs.


[19-Jan-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	Why is the price of drinking water so low?


[19-Jan-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i like keeping some small reserves - repair needs may have changed


[19-Jan-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	does not look that low on moria cx


[19-Jan-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	here? what about: this is a place a lot of dw is produced


[19-Jan-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	Does not seem worth making DW and exporting to Moria


[19-Jan-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	DW price isn't going to react as much to H2O price manipulation as folks making DW aren't usually buying H2O on the market


[19-Jan-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you expect H2O to stay at 45-50 and not drop back down to 30 - that's true - except it probably will drop


[19-Jan-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The current price is all driven by Niegrozny buying up H20 for lulz


[19-Jan-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	oh ok, so we are in an h2o bubble


[19-Jan-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but mordgier is right- i think most dw producers will handle their own h20 needs


[19-Jan-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i know that I do - definitel not adding that step to my logistics


[19-Jan-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Dude is burning millions to push the price up just for fun - how long he'll keep it up I dunno.


[19-Jan-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	depends how large the market is compared to his other operations.


[19-Jan-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	He feeds EDC to MM


[19-Jan-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So probably makes 300k a day just from that cheese


[19-Jan-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	In short, you should absolutely dump as much H2O on the market right now as you can afford to in order to benefit from the price, but I'd not spin up extra rigs expecting the price to last


[19-Jan-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	thx


[19-Jan-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	well, rig are easy to spin down, too


[19-Jan-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	on top if you plan i.e.to make more dw yourself, you can now sell the h20, then add the processing


[19-Jan-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Sure if you have a use for the perfabs after and space and it doesn't mean smashign stuff and all that


[19-Jan-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	DW is also more compact for shipping


[19-Jan-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	mmhhmm, you can sell a bunch of dw and it wont take much space up on your ships


[19-Jan-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	compared to gases and other stuff


[19-Jan-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	price also should be relatively slow moving - dw is really a major consumable


[19-Jan-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	is there a market here to sell mcg?


[19-Jan-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i wonder whether i should import it in larger amounts from moria


[19-Jan-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	;) my ships are too empty on the way here


[19-Jan-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I personally wouldn't bother to ship MCG from the CX at the current prices for sure


[19-Jan-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Unless you make the MCG yourself that is


[19-Jan-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you are making it, you can get slightly better margins on the LM vs CX but it's iffy - it'll take you far longer to move it via the LM than CX


[19-Jan-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Current MCG prices are pretty messed up given that actual construction costs of MCG are well under 16 per


[19-Jan-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You'd probably do better brining batches of prefabs for folks to buy for repairs


[19-Jan-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Far more compact and currently lower priced so less risk for you to be stuck with an item that you bought for 30 and is now selling for 22


[19-Jan-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	really not converned about short term price issues


[19-Jan-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	given how new my base here is - worst case I consume the mcg myself


[19-Jan-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	just shipped 750 in and a third is already gone


[19-Jan-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you want to make a better margin I can sell MCG at 25 from Montem


[19-Jan-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't care if you drag it right to the CX and dump it there at 30


[19-Jan-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	let me get in touch with you net time i need some ;)


[19-Jan-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	right now pussing as many gfabs here as i can to ramp up my food production as fast as possible ;)


[19-Jan-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I have 15 BMPs on montem so in general I produce more MCG than I can easily ship out


[19-Jan-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah. i see your issue ;)


[19-Jan-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	that is 2080 mcg per 500t shipload, right?


[19-Jan-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	whow


[19-Jan-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	2083 MCG I believe is a 500/500 load


[19-Jan-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, rounded that down a little


[19-Jan-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	can i accept a custom contract being on a free licence


[19-Jan-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	are they worth it


[19-Jan-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	if your planning to come back with a shipment yes


[19-Jan-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	otherwise eeeh doesnt make allot


[19-Jan-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	3k for a half load is a good rate imo


[19-Jan-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	but yeah I'd not be picking them up if I wasn't doing a run to the CX half empty


[19-Jan-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	5000~ round trip in gas to mor if you buy gas from me

[19-Jan-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	general 10000 is the good shipement... pending on distance


[19-Jan-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	i thought it was from moria to here but other way round


[19-Jan-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	that covers a back and forth anywhere reasonable


[19-Jan-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	one for each ship

[20-Jan-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	what happens if my required workforce exceeds my capacity?


[20-Jan-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	All buildings requiring that workforce become understaffed, lossing efficiency proportionate to the understaffing. I.e. if you are on 200 workforce of 100 available, all buildings using that workforce will run at 50%. Early on, overshooting workforce by 10 or 20 isn't a big deal. But if you got 30 buildings, and adding a 31st will reduce the other buildings output by 10%, it is.


[20-Jan-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's also % based. Being 20 short when your total staffing is 320/300 is a MUCH bigger deal than being at 3620/3600. Going slightly over cap can be worth for very large bases, but generally a bad idea.


[20-Jan-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Also in general very large bases are 'suboptimal due to permit costs, but often a good idea early on if you are shipping constrained


[20-Jan-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	With 1 permit on a new base giving 500 space, and the next 2 giving 250 each to a max of 1k size, the same permits could give 1500 space in 3 separate bases - of course then you have to manage 3 bases vs 1

[22-Jan-23 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	may you please elaborate?


[22-Jan-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	idk how to elaborate on that. like I can't remember how to provision something for a contract.


[22-Jan-23 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	relatively new, I've done it once but I can't remember how I did it.


[22-Jan-23 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what type of contract is it


[22-Jan-23 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	the kind where I need to provision something and then take it somewhere


[22-Jan-23 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what does it say in the "party" column?


[22-Jan-23 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	NEO Charter Strategy Executive


[22-Jan-23 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	did you do the things above the "provision" part?


[22-Jan-23 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if not do the things above


[22-Jan-23 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	the provision is #1


[22-Jan-23 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if there's no conditions above, then rent a warehouse (you're probably running out of space in your base)


[22-Jan-23 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you have plenty of space in your base, then check to see if you've accepted the contract?


[22-Jan-23 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or if it expired


[22-Jan-23 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	This is because you aren't provisioning the goods. the faction is


[22-Jan-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	accepted, plenty of space


[22-Jan-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	could you copy and paste all the conditions, the parties timeframe etc


[22-Jan-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and title/description


[22-Jan-23 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I'm missing something. I know I am. I've done this before but I'm drawing a blank


[22-Jan-23 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	send it over


[22-Jan-23 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	#1: Provisioning of 29 units of High-Carb Grains @ YI-715 - Verdant (YI-715b)


[22-Jan-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	do you have 29x GRN?


[22-Jan-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I do not.


[22-Jan-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then get 29x GRN


[22-Jan-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what does it say to the right  of the #1: Provisioning of 29 units of High-Carb Grains @ YI-715 - Verdant (YI-715b)


[22-Jan-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	is it blank?


[22-Jan-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then it's you


[22-Jan-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	stop confusing me xd


[22-Jan-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah, you have to send them the grains


[22-Jan-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	yeah, they're not paying enough to do that.


[22-Jan-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and you said the "party" column of the fufill table was them


[22-Jan-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	next time, read carefully


[22-Jan-23 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	party is blank on #1


[22-Jan-23 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	GRN.NC1


[22-Jan-23 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	now that;s the correct answer I'd hoped for


[22-Jan-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	yeah, they are paying for 12 of them, and that's not counting even the cost of fuel to get to orbit.


[22-Jan-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	...


[22-Jan-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ReAd PlEaSE


[22-Jan-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	#1: Provisioning of 29 units of High-Carb Grains @ YI-715 - Verdant (YI-715b)


[22-Jan-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	"@ YI-715 - Verdant (YI-715b)"


[22-Jan-23 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ELI5: give them the grains here at your base


[22-Jan-23 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	why would you have to ship anything?


[22-Jan-23 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	The planet you're on is "verdant"


[22-Jan-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	this is true, regardless they want 29 grains at about half their cost


[22-Jan-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	price of grains have risen


[22-Jan-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and you don't have to pay for shipping


[22-Jan-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	shipping is roughly 6.5k


[22-Jan-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(includes repairs)


[22-Jan-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Benefit for you: more money for you to spend in less time, since you don't have to send a full ship over to the CX to optimise on space


[22-Jan-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	eh shipping is irrelevant at this point, they're only paying about 90 NCC per unit


[22-Jan-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	wdym irrelevant?


[22-Jan-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	okay, if you want to burn your fuel and ships, go ahead


[22-Jan-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(or take longer to expand your base)


[22-Jan-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I'd have to buy all 29 units and take a loss by selling it for less than half of what I bought it for


[22-Jan-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	are you not a farmer?


[22-Jan-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I am not.


[22-Jan-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	how?


[22-Jan-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Verdant is one of the best farming planets


[22-Jan-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	im a victualler


[22-Jan-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	opportunity cost right there


[22-Jan-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	there'll be another contract come along, I'm going to terminate this one.


[22-Jan-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you do know you would've saved 90% of input costs if you had a farm?


[22-Jan-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	costs 4 NCC per crop


[22-Jan-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you're severely overpaying


[22-Jan-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I do not know, I know almost nothing about this game lol


[22-Jan-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I figured I'd try it since I'm on AS for several years now


[22-Jan-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	verdant is insanely efficient for farming. food is in high supply, so prices are high - but here you pay nearly nothing for production


[22-Jan-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	all input you need is water, and again, a single rig make a LOT of water (which again is in high demand also, so prices are high)


[22-Jan-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	water is the reason I picked this planet...


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	bruh


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	did you forget about fertility?


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	fertile planets are really rare


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and we have a Agriculture CoGC


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yep. which is why this has an agri policy (adding 25% output)


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	so I need a farmstead?


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	boosts farms by 25%


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	bruh


[22-Jan-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the output of a farm is close to insane here - which means VERY or production costs


[22-Jan-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	don't you get it now?


[22-Jan-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	get that farm now/asap.


[22-Jan-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	saves you 90% of food manufacturing costs


[22-Jan-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	a farm and a rig


[22-Jan-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	then you can expand from there to add more farms and a food processor


[22-Jan-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they have a rig already


[22-Jan-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	"water is the reason I picked this planet..."


[22-Jan-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	nothing against the water here, but that is taking a kilo of silver instead of a kiko of gold


[22-Jan-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the real benefit of this planet is fertility


[22-Jan-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I was quoting @harrellmatt84)


[22-Jan-23 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	have a collector and a food processor, idk why I ended up with collector first lol


[22-Jan-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you collect oxygen?


[22-Jan-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	intended to have rig first


[22-Jan-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i started with that too - but because i use a lot of oxygen ;)


[22-Jan-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I do collect oxygen


[22-Jan-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I collect oxygen and fly two ships around, sometimes with stuff on them even


[22-Jan-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you can sell the oxygen on moria for a good price


[22-Jan-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but unless you really use it - that is wasted potential


[22-Jan-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	Sorry I'm probably doing things entirely backward, but its just the way its been so far


[22-Jan-23 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I have a big order of oxygen I was planning on trying to sell on moria as soon as it's done


[22-Jan-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	That's one good thing to hear :)


[22-Jan-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you should join a corp - most of them have internal markets


[22-Jan-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and start looking for regular buyers


[22-Jan-23 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not work thorugh the public market so much


[22-Jan-23 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I'm always open to regular buyers. I'm below a week on this game total (I think)


[22-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	like you say you want to sell oxygen on moria - hang out in the chat there, try to find someone who needs regular oxygen


[22-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	then you know you ahve a buyer fast


[22-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Sorry for being mad at you earlier on.


[22-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i sell pretty much ALL my output to a player (in another corp actually)


[22-Jan-23 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I was stunned.


[22-Jan-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	he prepays for a week of output - so he finances my expansion - and I know there is a fast market


[22-Jan-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Next time, please do take the time to plan out where you're heading. :)


[22-Jan-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and once you arre like 2-3 weeks in and know you will not reset, ask for a credit - lots of experienced players help new ones out, which will help you get your base to a lot more than you have now fast


[22-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I got a 250k present after about a month (which I still will pay back soon, I hope) and it helped me to move from "doing stuff once per week" to at least do stuff every other day


[22-Jan-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	eh, I'm one of those that will try to stick it out as far as I possibly can...


[22-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, still - finding something that works is not a bad thing before expanding


[22-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	preferably WITHOUT moving goods - which you really did not do well, sorry, with oxygen here - not sure there are any busers here


[22-Jan-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i went into FE on valiant and my buyer is there, too. now i get independent for RAT and DW here


[22-Jan-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	shipping is a MAJOR cost at the beginning


[22-Jan-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I also havent had a day off work since I started this, so I havent had hours to play with it, just time here and there


[22-Jan-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I probably should have picked somewhere that didn't take so long to get to a CX or anything else.


[22-Jan-23 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	possibly. bing fast to a market is like core - also savves costs


[22-Jan-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Anyone willing to do a H2O/DW Trade in a ratio of 3:2? (I give 3x H2O, you give 2x DW) (up to 48x H2O/ 32 DW)


[22-Jan-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	whow. first "real" trip back to valis tomorrow and it looks like my little hauler will finally be over 90% full

[24-Jan-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so therefore there needs to be a lot of water in order for it to grow, hence it being grown in a HYF


[24-Jan-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my two cents


[24-Jan-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	luxury resource - check the others. always more complex than the basic ones.


[24-Jan-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	coffee as farm element would be way too simple except if the would limit temperatures, but that is not done in any other recipe, so it iy hydro so that people can not make large amounts easily.


[24-Jan-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	yeah.  I am saving up to get the bases/chain up for it but it's going to be a while


[24-Jan-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Hey I'm just a little grain farmer over here waiting for my WCB upgrades to actually use the grain to make C


[24-Jan-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I can give you MCG


[24-Jan-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You want some MCG? I got MCG...


[24-Jan-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I ain't got much besides MCG...and bfabs


[24-Jan-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But yeah I uhh kinda set this little ghetto up without much COF thinking 'surely I can just buy it on the LM" - and well seems not? I dunno - am I asking for too much?


[24-Jan-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I got Bfabs/LFabs myself


[24-Jan-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	problem is nobody's willing to sell or produce CAF on Verdant


[24-Jan-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if that problem is fixed, I'd be selling COF all the time


[24-Jan-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah but like...do you have any here that you'd ship to the CX for sale?


[24-Jan-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	well Verdant is kind of in a bas stop to make CAF it uses so much H2O


[24-Jan-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	not economical to buy CAF from CX


[24-Jan-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(let alone large quantities)


[24-Jan-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well - anyone need garbage brought from Moria then, 100COF means I got 490 free


[24-Jan-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Mordgier we could partner up one day


[24-Jan-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you make CAF I make COF


[24-Jan-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	in fact, I have 1 tiny piece of trash I need to bring back


[24-Jan-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well I'm on the hook to make GRN here so I'm committed to that


[24-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I just needed COF cause I only have 3d's worth left


[24-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	why doesn't anyone make CAF


[24-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I asked like 5 people already


[24-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Seems like I have to do everything from scratch here


[24-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Because C is broken


[24-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	I'm running empty otherwise sooo


[24-Jan-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	anyone need oxygen?


[25-Jan-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nah, got too much already


[25-Jan-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	almost lost money on oxygen


[25-Jan-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	just figured I'd ask before taking it to the exchange


[25-Jan-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plenty of oxygen in this planet, that's for sure


[25-Jan-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	after that's sold and I get paid for all the transports I've been doing, I'm going to build a rig


[25-Jan-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep, water's also a good thing to produce


[25-Jan-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	then I'll have a collector, a farmstead, a food processor, and a rig


[25-Jan-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	The one thing I'm curious if I should build is a refinery


[25-Jan-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	There's a local refinery right on verdant


[25-Jan-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you make 2k/day with a refinery


[25-Jan-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(in case you were interested)


[25-Jan-23 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	interesting. my biggest thing is producing fuel to keep hauling stuff around.


[25-Jan-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(considering current prices)


[25-Jan-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah, it'd probably be better to use a refinery to produce your own fuel rather than sell it off given low margins


[25-Jan-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I just wonder what its yield is


[25-Jan-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh


[25-Jan-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	like how much fuel a day?


[25-Jan-23 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	600 SF a day if running for 24 hours


[25-Jan-23 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same with FF


[25-Jan-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	but I'd need two to run FF and SF yeah?


[25-Jan-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	REF's a so-so. I built one when FF prices hit 21. The input for the REF is pretty steep in cost and got to be imported. So I can barely produce at ~14 self cost. So when FF normalized to 15, it became fairly inprofitable, so I'm considering to tear it down again, particularly now that I got a bit higher base income and aren't immedeately fazed by FF going back up to 17. Still undecided, tbh


[25-Jan-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no


[25-Jan-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can do half day SF and half day FF


[25-Jan-23 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	you can do any mix of of production orders in even a single building, with the smallest chunk being whatever time frame a 1x order requires :P


[25-Jan-23 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^


[25-Jan-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can even do units smaller than that


[25-Jan-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(though high in production fees)


[25-Jan-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	I'm finding fuel can be a complication since I can only get one kind on the local market...


[25-Jan-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	No, both kinds are supplied


[25-Jan-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FF just gets taken fasteer


[25-Jan-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You got to time your sessions right


[25-Jan-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	xd


[25-Jan-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(kinda hard with multiple timezones)


[25-Jan-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	FF was the one that I seem to have to fly to moria for, which kinda sucks


[25-Jan-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	as of right now (current prices), it's cheaper to get FF straight from the CX than produce it yourself


[25-Jan-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You're losing money if you produce FF


[25-Jan-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	though the trip to the CX in itself uses FF, and importing raw materials requires it too, so I'm not quite sure


[25-Jan-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Eh, as I said, you're producing FF für ~14 if you import everything from CX at 100/H and 400/HE3. Problem is you're also only making 600 in profits per day if the price is 15.


[25-Jan-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Which, given the up front cost for the input, is just not very economical.


[25-Jan-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	only good for making SF constantly


[25-Jan-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you'd have to run it for over 2 weeks straight for it to make back it's cost


[25-Jan-23 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	At least the REF, for being a quasi-T2 building, isn't THAT expensive in construction. Imagine a HYF with that low a profit margin. (hint: It's CAF)


[25-Jan-23 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	here is the point with ff and sf - why do it hre? i fly back from moria system empty anyway


[25-Jan-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	grab it there, gaab larger amounts, stockpile where y ouneed it


[25-Jan-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	done. no need o run a refinery here


[25-Jan-23 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	As mentioned, the point was being independent of that 21er FF price


[25-Jan-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If you fly back from moria empty, then you'll have the cargo to take the raw materials to verdant.


[25-Jan-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	What's the reasoning behind this?


[25-Jan-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	behind flying to verdant empty? Not bothering mostly. I am moving building materials to verdant, then goods back to moria - except outside the occasional "tons of MCG" the buildeing materials rarely make more than a dent in my ship. and dshipping contracts are just a pain for now


[25-Jan-23 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I think the question was "How is 'you can just use free cargo capacity to import fuel' an argument against producing fuel by using that same cargo space to import input material instead?"


[25-Jan-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	point is - there is no real gain in making your own fuel


[25-Jan-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i can as well just refuel on moria or use the cargo capacity to move the product in and focus on stuff that gives me more money as output


[25-Jan-23 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blackend**:	tryiing to make everything is an endless pit


[25-Jan-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You can save some fuel and fly to Midway (wb-675i) to purchase your fuel.  Just post a buy ad on the LM there.


[25-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It's also a good place to set up your own refinery base or just buy the inputs for FF and SF.


[25-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Everything is cheaper that at CX.


[25-Jan-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Note that it costs more fuel, and deals more damage to a ship, to make that stop there. Gas giants gotta be like that.


[25-Jan-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	well that sucks


[25-Jan-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah, its mainly due to them having at least one red bar. rare to see them all green

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Gas giants don't cause any significant additional damage.  It has more to do with the flight path.  The only big damage increase is from planets with high gravity.


[25-Jan-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It does not cost more fuel or deal more damage to land on wb-675i.


[25-Jan-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I've dropped both Verdant-> Mor and Verdant->WB-675i into the FLT sim. It takes a 100er chunk more of SF for the latter, causes +50% wear on the ship (and is a couple hours faster).


[25-Jan-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	If running *only* for the fuel, it might be an alternative to CX. But I probably can't selll my produce on WB, and saving a bit on fuel prices is not worth the additional stop.


[25-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	100 more SF but also 100 less FF (which is more expensive).  Wear isn't +50% (0.227% vs 0.250%).  There are also other factors that influence those numbers (type of ship, how fast you want to fly, where planets/CX are at in their orbits...).  In any case, it won't be worthwhile for everyone but it is an option for people who want a shorter flight and cheaper prices than the CX.  I primarily stock gases, fuel and fuel inputs but other goods could be made available as well.


[25-Jan-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Shipping between wb-675 and Moria costs me 12NCC/t.  If you are willing to sell below the CX rate then I could buy your produce at WB.


[25-Jan-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'll simply reiterate the key point: If you don't need bulk deals for stuff offered at WB, it's not worth adding another stop, particularly not at a costly landing site, just to buy some fuel. Keep in mind the previous argument was about running a single REF for self-sufficient fuel. Not a whole stack.


[25-Jan-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	And no, I don't think selling profits to you to create a reason to visit WB would be a sound plan, even if I weren't in the process of setting up a new base with CX being the cheap keypin in logistics because it's not a planet :P


[25-Jan-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Don't worry.  I'm not trying to argue that you're wrong or that you specifically should come to WB.  I only believe in offering win-win negotiations.  I just want people to know that the option is there and in the right circumstances it will be beneficial.  And if it isn't beneficial I am willing to work things out to make it so.


[25-Jan-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	so what happens when i buy an ad on here, pay, and he doesnt deliver by the due date?


[25-Jan-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You can extend the contract and try to get the person to deliver.  Otherwise, you just lose your money.


[25-Jan-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	you mean pirating?


[25-Jan-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	lol...pirating...what?


[25-Jan-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	is that really a thing?


[25-Jan-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	Id extend and contact them if you can


[25-Jan-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	ok...will do.


[25-Jan-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	um I dont think there alot of deliberate pirating but yes that what that would be called


[25-Jan-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	btw @Alblaka - I think I see where I misunderstood how you were coming up with extra damage and fuel cost.  You were counting flying from Verdant to WB then from WB to Moria.  I was counting Verdant to WB or Verdant to Moria.


[25-Jan-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	cause they get to keep the shipment


[25-Jan-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i see that now...never really thought about it before.


[25-Jan-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	More often lost payments/shipments are the result of players who don't understand how it works or just stop playing the game.


[25-Jan-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yes, hence why I said deliberate, and that the first thing to do would be extend and contact them


[25-Jan-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	after that if they seem still active you can go to community discord and report them as a pirate


[25-Jan-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	(if they didn't contact you back or deliver of course)


[25-Jan-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	if it was a large loss I could try help you out, getting pirated this early in your game can be quite bad


[25-Jan-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	just DM if that ends up the case


[25-Jan-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	nah, it was 2500...and lesson learned.


[25-Jan-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	thank you for the offer though.


[25-Jan-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	@alblaka @Orgebeef-backkicker what were the goods you were you trying to move?


[25-Jan-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	bad, if they were moving something from Moria to verdant, I could have hauled it probably for free if I'd known 3 hrs ago


[25-Jan-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	@gridley heh better then 152500 lost atleast


[25-Jan-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	but I've got a bunch of little shipments that have to be made between the two in the next 3 days so my little ships are going to be going nonstop


[25-Jan-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	lol...yeah, much different reaction getting burned for 152500.


[25-Jan-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I was responding to a discussion 12hrs back about buying/shipping fuel.  I offered my planet as an option and @alblaka said it wouldn't work for him because he'd still need to fly to Moria to sell his farm goods.


[25-Jan-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	@swordofdm why are some names in green, like yours, in chat?


[25-Jan-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	hmmmm Im going to just guess that its because I bought a supporter package of the game


[25-Jan-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	if you look at me or the others you can see we have badges


[25-Jan-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	cool...it is an awesome game.  i can see why it gets support.


[25-Jan-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I did it so I can have a 2 letter tag :p also number of months you by for lower end packages is pretty good


[25-Jan-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i just checked them out...maybe I will do one of those soon as well.


[25-Jan-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	not much for me to do yet...but it is fun planning the base.


[25-Jan-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	and i just sold my first carbon deal...that was exciting.  :-)


[25-Jan-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	In general, I'd recommend contacting the potentialy-breaching player and waiting the 24h period to figure out what went wrong. Depending on the response they'll get extended or breached. But in both cases usually end up the blacklist (you can block players from ever accepting your ads in future), because even if it was just the other play making a mistake, that's still a good enough reason not to risk further mistakes :P


[25-Jan-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	so...i am out the 2500.  he sent a request to terminate, i accepted it, thinking i would get my funds back.  but apparently thats now how it works.  live and learn...


[25-Jan-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	*not

**Gridley**:	ad up for 100 MCG.


[25-Jan-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ye no, he basically scammed you into not hitting him with the breach penalty.


[25-Jan-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	is there a list of known pirates somewhere?


[25-Jan-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Don't think it's common enough an issue to warrant a list. Most 'pirating' tend to fall into 'new players accepting contracts, but then just quitting the game' territory. We have a corp-internal list, but I don't know whether there's a public one.


[25-Jan-23 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	there is channel for pirate reports at UFO


[25-Jan-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-23 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harrellmatt84**:	@dogeconomy contract accepted. I'll pick it up in about an hour.

**harrellmatt84**:	correction: picked up


[26-Jan-23 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@castrothemexican Note that local stuff is fairly irrelevant to you; you can't trade with players (via contracts or LM) without a PRO/BASIC license, so even if you produce here, you'll still have to fly over to CX to buy/sell.

**DogeConomy**:	They can contribute in the running of the planet though by contributing to the CoGC, safety stations etc


[26-Jan-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(volunteer work, that is)


[26-Jan-23 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	In theory yes, in practice no. Upkeep is the responsibility of the governeur (go figure why it's the large companies doing that), and Kuben is being pretty clear on the front that Verdant is having no issues paying for it's own upkeep. So, if you contribute to the upkeep, especially as a smaller company, you're more likely to HINDER Verdant by stiffling your own growth to save the governeur a non-expense.


[26-Jan-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So yeah, they can technically do that part. But they really shouldn't, until WAY later.


[26-Jan-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(they said they wanted to help though xd)


[26-Jan-23 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The point is: They're not helping by crippling their own growth. Any RAT you donate today could be 10 RATs in a month or 100 in a year. So if there's no immedeate upkeep shortage, you help Verdant best by helping yourself into a position where your help takes on relevant quantities :P

**castrothemexican**:	thank you guys for responding :) i plan on getting a license so I should be up and running a little faster. I'm assuming most of us are focused on agri?


[26-Jan-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Agri or H2O+C(+O) extraction.


[26-Jan-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah. the 25% bonus on farms AND the fact that you have high fertility - which is extremely rare - make it kind of a must


[26-Jan-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CPY**:	im ranching bugs here


[26-Jan-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	Mmmm...bugs!


[26-Jan-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Objection. Fertility is not 'high'. It's barely a third in the positive. Just that this is still on the higher end of overall fertility ratings actually present in the universe :D


[26-Jan-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(It's just a 11% bonus efficiency, in the end. 5 Specs is 40%, COGC is 25%, in comparison)


[26-Jan-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	verdants fertility is 8%


[26-Jan-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i know because i have it pulled up


[26-Jan-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The fertility bonus here is still significant, 5 experts is 28.4%, but importantly it stacks, so it's 1.08*1.25*1.284 for the full bonus here.


[26-Jan-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Equivalent of about 12.84% extra from the base 100%, coincidentally the same as 3 experts lol


[26-Jan-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	my eff when fully staffed is 151% on my frms


[26-Jan-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	nvm, 3 experts is 12.48... been a while since I've had 3 experts lol


[26-Jan-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	3 experts would be 150% here yeah, with 5 it's ~171%


[26-Jan-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	thats with three experts though i will boost it to 5 when i get the others in time


[26-Jan-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Agri is just the worst to gain experts in (particularly FRM's)


[26-Jan-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	so slow


[26-Jan-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	well im running two frms rn with plans to get a third


[26-Jan-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	just need more rigs for other things


[26-Jan-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	Why are FRM's harder to get experts from?


[26-Jan-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	tame to make stuff


[26-Jan-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	like im waiting nearly six days for 80 units of beans


[26-Jan-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	yes, that is a pain...me too.  I guess i dont understand why that would take experts longer to appear though.  or maybe i misunderstood what @realbandit meant....


[26-Jan-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	@Gridley FRM's are 30 area per building, so you can only fit 12 or 13 in a 500 area. Take RIG's, which can fit 35 in a 500 area and it's rather slow comparitively


[26-Jan-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	ahhh...that makes sense.  ty


[26-Jan-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	which means a max of 26 when you have a maxed out base


[26-Jan-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	thats with a 1000 area base


[26-Jan-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but you can replace some or more of them with.... hydroponics


[26-Jan-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	they are massive


[26-Jan-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	same agriculture expertise, and only 15 are cost - needs more water, though


[26-Jan-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	27 FRM's if you only want 1 STO


[26-Jan-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah HYF are the way to go to maximize the FRM products, and speed up experts


[26-Jan-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ill use hydroponics elsewhere.


[26-Jan-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	mainly a place with lst


[26-Jan-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Shipping the H2O is more of an issue than the NS, depends what you want to run though


[26-Jan-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i have water here on verdant and i produce a fair bit anyway


[26-Jan-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	nitrogen i can probs buy from someone or cx while water i can ship and lst i could mine for the ns


[26-Jan-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	interesting...i'm planning on building my 5th FRM soon.  I was looking at the HYF, long way out for me investment wise anyways.  but i like seeing you guys talk about it and get your insights.


[26-Jan-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im planning a gas base as with a metalurgy/chemical base


[26-Jan-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	I haven't really been looking at a new base yet.  I mean I've been checking out systems around for fun, but nothing serious.


[26-Jan-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah im planning a few bases for various things. one is making flx and other stuff


[26-Jan-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	then that makes sense to go to an LST planet.  you can make FLX and NS.

[28-Jan-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Ah, have to have Verdant as the destination or origin.  Well lets see if people want to bring stuff here from one jump away for 8/t  Then I can ship it out again.


[28-Jan-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	It does go through inputs quickly but quite productive for a small facility


[28-Jan-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I want another INC but I need more farms


[28-Jan-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	how many farms per inc?


[28-Jan-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	or I could go back to buying GRN, MAI, and HCP on the CXs and I don't want to do that


[28-Jan-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I haven't figured it out exactly because I also do RATs but I am guessing about 3 FRMs to support 1 INC doing 4,2,2 recipe. if doing nothing else


[28-Jan-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**antonlowe**:	thx


[28-Jan-23 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-23 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am doing 2 FPs and 3 FRMs, but soon 4


[28-Jan-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that I think will cover RATs/DW split in 2 FPs and at least enough for 1 hungry INC


[28-Jan-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think with 5 FRMs I can support 2 INCs and the RATs


[28-Jan-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KDG**:	do yall bother doing the recipe that requires HCP MAI GRN


[29-Jan-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Eh I'd say resource richness is pretty dire and '


[30-Jan-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	and erm 'not as space should be'


[30-Jan-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	for a "prosperous universe" - it's pretty barren.


[30-Jan-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Like I'm not saying that I expect us to be tripping over gold or something, but Iron, H2O and Carbon should be pretty much everywhere


[30-Jan-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm so:so on that. Like, Iron and H20 *is* on a lot of planets. Just that the quantities of the deposits aren't exactly breathtaking. Which might simply be an abstraction of the resource being present, plentiful even, but hard to harvest. Arguably, even a very inefficient extractor can apparently produce tons of pure Iron Ore in a single day with just a few dozen people. So there's that.


[30-Jan-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	And consequently, it makes for good gameplay if you have a few outstanding-yield deposits that attract a lot of attention... but I think the game would profit from having more, smaller planets (or a much larger playerbase, either does the job), plus an actual exploration / surveying system. Where you have players burning expensive equipment and time on trying to discover new resource deposits, in turn causing the occasional 'gold rush' when a great deposit is found and large crowds of players rush in to try profiting of it, causing market waves that then create entertaining gameplay, etc... but that's all in the future, I'd guess? So currently, the relatively barren universe does it's job for the given playerbase.


[30-Jan-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	yeah, works for now for sure.  I like the idea of random resource finds on planets, creating "Gold Rush" scenarios.

**erre**:	YI-280b


[30-Jan-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	you could get a realy high production of MGC


[30-Jan-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	first decide what you want to do, then search for planet that will help you with that


[30-Jan-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also try to avoid planets with gravity/temperature/pressure in red


[30-Jan-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	they are expensive to build on


[30-Jan-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	SIO is far easier to ship than LST for MCG


[30-Jan-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	how dose biulding on a high pressure or gravity change the cost


[30-Jan-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erre**:	also what is LST


[30-Jan-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	limestone


[30-Jan-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	pressure requires hardened structural elements. idk about gravity tho


[30-Jan-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	wait im dumb. high pressure needs breathable liquid while gravity needs hardened structural elements


[30-Jan-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	other than that building doesnt change much bar a few things depending on temp which will mean you either need foam, thermal shielding, pressure would be sealent or breathable liquid, gravity would be light weight or hardened elements. if its a gas world you also need AEF but if its rocky you need MCG


[30-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	and main thing is that you will require those expensive materials again when you have to repair your buildings


[30-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	And it's not just a one time thing. You need to spend that to repair also


[30-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah unless you go full slum mode and do not repair and embrace eternal 30% efficiency


[30-Jan-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you should go for such planets only to get rare resources


[30-Jan-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	or if benefits will outweight the cost


[30-Jan-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im eyeballing two planets here. both low temp but have what i need for several production lines in various industries


[30-Jan-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you dont need to settle planets right next to you, you can look few jumps away


[30-Jan-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	they are a few jumps away


[30-Jan-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ones a gas planet with hydrogen and argon while the other has iron ore, bioreactive minerals and halite crystals (salt)


[30-Jan-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also take into account volume of import/export of your planned base, if you need to visit it often its good if its close, but if you need to visit it like once in ten days then you can have it further away


[30-Jan-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im aware of that


[30-Jan-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you can use PRUNner to plan and calculate your input/output of bases


[30-Jan-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	these bases i plan to let sit for a bit and bring back large loads. once i get the required parts im going to upgrade the tanks and cargo bays of my ships to all large tanks and bays


[30-Jan-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	one so i dont have to refuel my ships each trip to moria and second is to move large amounts of cargo between bases and cx


[30-Jan-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	-b


[30-Jan-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	the thing is with those bases as well they wil have several stos to provide a large amount of storage. mainly the smeltinh/chemical base ill be using for various things


[30-Jan-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	smelting*

[30-Jan-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	true, but connection doesnt mean they are around.  :-)


[30-Jan-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i see his shipping contracts that i can take.


[30-Jan-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	They check PrUn twice a day


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I got a shipping contract on the same route as well :D


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i have fuel now...but never done a contract before.


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Simple


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	shipping contract


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Accept the shipping contracts


[30-Jan-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	deliver them within the timeframe listed


[30-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(the packages will say "SHPT" and looks like a black box)


[30-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	move them onto your ship and depart Verdant for Moria


[30-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	when i get to moria...is there just a fulfill buton i press?


[30-Jan-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll be posting more contracts more often soon


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(i.e in the next few weeks)


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	ok...i'll take his...but yours is too cheap.  ;-)


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what do you mean?


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	mine is more expensive


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	jk...:-)


[30-Jan-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	shipping contracts are calculated at a tonnage/cubed meterage basis


[30-Jan-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(the profitability of one)


[30-Jan-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll quickly calculate profitability for you


[30-Jan-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	break even for one way trip (including repairs) is 4.65 NCC/u


[30-Jan-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but since you'll want your ship to come back to verdant, aim for 9-12 NCC


[30-Jan-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	so if i lower my fuel and deliver in 1 day and 18 hours...that should be good for you guys?


[30-Jan-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Deliver in 5 days, and we'll be happy


[30-Jan-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	best to keep fuel to min/min


[30-Jan-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	saves money


[30-Jan-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	That's what I do with my shipping contracts


[30-Jan-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	ok...


[30-Jan-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	min is 2 days 14 hours


[30-Jan-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	all g with me


[30-Jan-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	sounds good.  the other contracts are 5 days too.  its a go.  accepting now...


[30-Jan-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ty


[30-Jan-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I find min/min fuel just TOO slow. For marginally more fuel, you can usually shave 25% off the time.


[30-Jan-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the contracts were for 5 days


[30-Jan-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it doesn't matter


[30-Jan-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and I don't think they need their ships that much


[30-Jan-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I mean, sure - if you don't need to arrive anytime soon - but personally if I had 5 days before I needed something delivered, I'd do another shipment in the meanwhile - or even just have my ship wait around in case there was another shipment I could tag on as well; or in case I needed my ship for something else


[30-Jan-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i wont have the funds to buy what i want in moria for another couple days...so the slow boat is fine for me.


[30-Jan-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I usually aim for MOR<->VER to take around 1 day; especially since that works out nicely that my ships are always arriving at the same time of day (when I get home from work)


[30-Jan-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Is your ship heading to Moria full?


[30-Jan-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[30-Jan-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think their's is


[30-Jan-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	based off the 4x 100m^3 and 1x 6m^3 contracts


[30-Jan-23 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i have a just under 100t left...you need anything shipped?


[30-Jan-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@gridley got some more things I want shipped


[30-Jan-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	will come to about 10m^3/t


[30-Jan-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Not particularly... I mean, if it stops you from leaving with space in your ship I could throw a 21t contract your way. My ship literally left Verdant just a couple hours ago


[30-Jan-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I was just going to say; if your ship was only half full - would probably make more financial sense keep your ship here and fly a little faster to make up for it and see if any more contracts came up on the LM


[30-Jan-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	But if you're already full; then that doesn't make sense


[30-Jan-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	up to you charlie.  send the other contract doge.


[30-Jan-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	btw...ty for the advice charlie.


[30-Jan-23 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I mean - going slow and economical isn't bad advice. If you crunch the numbers; it may well make sense to do that.


[30-Jan-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	I'm just saying for me personally; two days in each direction is WAAAAY too slow. I know this isn't a fast pased game; but I like the fact that my ships are departing every day, means I always feel like I'm achieving something.


[30-Jan-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@gridley got another one


[30-Jan-23 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's it for this round


[30-Jan-23 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Now that I have multiple planets, I typically use one ship per base. But when I only had a base on Verdant, and the two starter ships - I also liked to keep one ship on MORIA and one on VERDANT - and I would make both depart at the same time. That way I was always ready at the drop of the hat to move goods in either direction.


[30-Jan-23 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	@charlie-fox  that does sound like a good plan.


[30-Jan-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I also do that :)


[30-Jan-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	tbh moria station is a better place to get contracts if you're planning on doing cross-cx trading


[30-Jan-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	right now i make so little excess...it all sells here.  i do want some stuff from moria tho.  hopefully i can bring back stuff for other people here too when i come back.


[30-Jan-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	They pay really well too


[30-Jan-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	combined with profit from arbitrage = stonks 📈


[30-Jan-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	yes, my other ship is at moria right now...waiting to do a two way contract for someone else.


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	takes money to make money...so far all my profits have gone to expanding my base.


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	no arbitage for me yet.


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my profits have gone into creating a storage problem for myself


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	:-D


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	still trying to fix that problem


[30-Jan-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	lol


[30-Jan-23 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Sooo what I would say, is you will very rarely get shipping contracts MOR-VER. Certainly none to make it all that worthwhile.


[30-Jan-23 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	not much left to do here this eve...i'm out.


[30-Jan-23 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**charlie-fox**:	Most people here are producing RATS etc.   which means pretty much all their input comes from Rigs on planet or the LM leaving only the occasional consumables consumables. Hence why I consider a profitable price for shipping here to be ~8/unit


[30-Jan-23 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	i will keep that in mind...still figuring stuff out.  now i really am shutting down.  :-)


[30-Jan-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I just recently learned from lowstrife that there is currently no way to delete or remove those chat histories.


[01-Feb-23 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I've wondered about that, as well. COM takes a couple seconds to load up, and I feel like that's not going to change for the better as I spend more time in the game :P Shame to hear there's no such feature.


[01-Feb-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that is one that I think might happen sometime.  They recently added an option to delete fulfilled from CONTS which had been asked for and this seems similar.


[01-Feb-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	big difference I guess is that you could already delete individual fulfilled contracts

[02-Feb-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	not yet, it has been my plan though...but, i always seem to just be meeting my needs.


[02-Feb-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i am, but i use them for my own at the moment


[02-Feb-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i DO have a water surplus though - not sure how much it is really, setting up buildings all the time


[02-Feb-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	what amounts do you look for?


[02-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I have about 200 H2O to spare right now and will continue producing extra for a few more weeks


[02-Feb-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am front-loaded for future HYFs


[02-Feb-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and also was a good time to have extra water


[02-Feb-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I use about 60/d of each.  It would be nice to just buy it here instead of importing from Moria.  I'll take your 200 H2O.  Is 35/u a fair price?


[02-Feb-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	That is fair right now. DrTom answered first though.  I'll give him first option on it.


[02-Feb-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I probably produce about 40/day surplus but I expect that to go away once I put up the HYFs in a couple of weeks or around that


[02-Feb-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	What are you producing @purpdrag?


[02-Feb-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Mostly FRMs doing HCP, GRN, MAI for my INC on Vallis and also RATs using the BEA, NUT, GRN recipe and DW


[02-Feb-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	Nice.


[02-Feb-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	And O to send to Vallis


[02-Feb-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that's all right now, but looking forward to HYFs and a FER so I can make COF, KOM, and other stuff


[02-Feb-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	I haven't got that far in any of the production chains.  Just doing RAT's soon FIMs with DDT supply coming in and water.


[02-Feb-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	the HYFs are quite expensive to build and also first Settlers here so I'll need all those supplies


[02-Feb-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@DrTom Do you want the water sale for Ogrebeef?


[02-Feb-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@Ogrebeef I'll give it about 10-15 minutes and then SEND you a contract.  SEND.  Ha ha. See what I did there?


[02-Feb-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Contract sent for the 200


[02-Feb-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@purpdrag I haven't gotten around to mathing out FER/KOM yet, too busy setting up C at Prism. So if you got surplus production on KOM, I might buy that in the mid-term. (Long-term I would probably throw a FER or two onto my planned 3rd base that will have a Food Industry focus)


[02-Feb-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Does anyone have a spare BBH?  If so, send a contract or post it on the LM


[03-Feb-23 04:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If anyone miscalculated the amount of MCG.NC1 they were going to buy from the CX, I sell emergency batches for cheaper on my LM corner store 🏪📦🧱.


[03-Feb-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yo @dyson how'd you get a base on Sheol so fast? was it an investment by an old player?


[03-Feb-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	H2O up for 28/u in batches of 300. O up for 55/u in batches of 100.


[03-Feb-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	The water retard, and it is only 1 EXT lol


[03-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	I was running 35 RIG lol


[03-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ayy what


[03-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	only 1x EXT?


[03-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Now it's just 10 COL and 20 RIG


[03-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Yeah, Sheol is a work in progress


[03-Feb-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ahh okay


[03-Feb-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	When that guy was buying unlimited amounts of water at 45/u i had to take advantage


[03-Feb-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ha lol


[03-Feb-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I wish I scaled more on water extraction


[03-Feb-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but it's alright lol


[03-Feb-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	going to set up 2 new bases soon


[03-Feb-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Yeah, I'm just waiting on Vallis to open again.


[03-Feb-23 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same-ish (montem) but my hopes have been crushed by the number of new players joining


[03-Feb-23 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	So I have someplace to sell the ALO


[03-Feb-23 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If you smelt it into AL, I'll buy some from you


[03-Feb-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Not sure what the Vallis base will be yet. I was thinking just smelt it on Sheol, but that distance >.< I can go to Benten and back in the time it takes me to fly there 1 way


[03-Feb-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah sheol is pretty far for an AL planet


[03-Feb-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you'd have to get all the resources ready and fully loaded onto a ship before travelling there


[03-Feb-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and make a huge stockpile


[03-Feb-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(so no fuel is wasted)


[03-Feb-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	where is my OVE/PWO hook up???


[03-Feb-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	How much OVE you need?


[03-Feb-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I'm in the same "gang" as the OVE lord)


[03-Feb-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	lol haha


[03-Feb-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	haha GTU he will be like i just 10,000


[03-Feb-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	i need to scale up so much sigh


[03-Feb-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah... this is a really slow game...


[03-Feb-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	yeah ... im sure that is just my perception with just 2 bases ... i imagine at 5 or 10 bases and trying to coordinate all the production and shipping i will be more grateful for the games pace


[03-Feb-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I ffed up my CONTD to @McGangsta


[03-Feb-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(his "PRUN as fast as possible" tutorial)


[03-Feb-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	i hope he can get some type of renumeration off all his hard work


[03-Feb-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	just reading chat i learn something usually


[03-Feb-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same


[03-Feb-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	and Vallis is up to +11 sigh


[03-Feb-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	few days ago it was +1


[03-Feb-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	ikr


[03-Feb-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so frustrating xd


[03-Feb-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	looking at the amount of stuff i need to transfer around the place im gonna need upgraded ships as with new ones


[03-Feb-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yup


[03-Feb-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	check global


[03-Feb-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	4mil yeah


[03-Feb-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	seems about avg for how i want my bases set up. got one hitting near 5m


[03-Feb-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	also hope you like nitrogen. base im planning on kub will be producing a load of it


[03-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmm NS and SEN


[03-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	SEN.NC1 seems like the way to go


[03-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah every 5.5 days once everything is made up be lookin at 8k nitrogen


[03-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ayo what 8k Nitrogen?


[03-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ill be having a load of collectors


[03-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	There's not much use for nitrogen though, just those two recipes


[03-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you'll have to sell them to CX then


[03-Feb-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ill sell what i dont use since ill need nitrogen myself for the ns plants over at 705c


[03-Feb-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	even then barely makes a dent in it


[03-Feb-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	SEN goes in GF (glass factory) to make glass


[03-Feb-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	glass can be used to make BTA and LTA


[03-Feb-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	the base hase 20 hab 1s, 40 col and 11 sto


[03-Feb-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	holy schmoly


[03-Feb-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	haha


[03-Feb-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	so 20x10 = 200 x 40 = 8000


[03-Feb-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You're making up over a quarter of Moria's H supply then


[03-Feb-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(42% by current numbers, 26% adjusted for your supply)


[03-Feb-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	harpina will be producing just shy of 700 hydrogen daily


[03-Feb-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	once fully running


[03-Feb-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Too much Hydrogen, unless you're planning to take down @ogrebeef-backkicker


[03-Feb-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	na


[03-Feb-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ill sell it or give it to people who need it for pe, pg and stl and ftl fuel


[03-Feb-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you're going to need a whole logistics team to transport all that out


[03-Feb-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	mmhhmm


[03-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh I thought harpina was another nitrogen base xd


[03-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	one of the bases i have will be producing 30 helim a day


[03-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	misread


[03-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	na its hydrogen and argon


[03-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah H is good for our corp


[03-Feb-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but still nitrogen seems like a bit overkill


[03-Feb-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	one of my bases ill be making a bunch of carbon but its going to be used to off and some other stuff


[03-Feb-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	PE.NC1


[03-Feb-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	well i could turn kub into a hybrid base and make fuel there. just need a supply of he3


[03-Feb-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	YI-683h


[03-Feb-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	looks like i need base lv24 to get that base


[03-Feb-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	unless I run it for you


[03-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm doing that for one of my base permits


[03-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah fair point


[03-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ill redo kub and low the amount of collectors to like 15 or something


[03-Feb-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Orm (DW-456g) seems better, it's more developed


[03-Feb-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(for HE3)


[03-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	right next to the cx as well


[03-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	since you already have an argon base, no need to go for the YI-683h base


[03-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and DW-456g has a higher he3 concentration


[03-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ive taken that into consideration


[03-Feb-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	low temp world. seems to be like most i find lol


[03-Feb-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	only normal temp planets out there are


[03-Feb-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	EY-430d


[03-Feb-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and Hermes (KI-448b)


[03-Feb-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	kiruna


[03-Feb-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	We're talking he3 here


[03-Feb-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or are we talking normal planets in general?


[03-Feb-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ive just realised i havent set a base up for lst. ulness i buy cx or people who have it


[03-Feb-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah, better join me


[03-Feb-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	AM-783c


[03-Feb-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	going to build there


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i could pull a permit from kub and use it there without needing to go to like lv27


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	make that 2 permits


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	hm?


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	There's a SIO planet nearby


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and it's fertile


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i get sio from a planet im on


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ah


[03-Feb-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nvm


[03-Feb-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	xg430b


[03-Feb-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I was going to say I was going to dock my ships between those two


[03-Feb-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	mine has higher concentration and also has water higher than verdant


[03-Feb-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	hmm, wouldnt hurt to have another food base


[03-Feb-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	planet on corp channel


[03-Feb-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	whats the planets name that is fertile


[03-Feb-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	far away tho


[03-Feb-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	let me guess poseidon


[03-Feb-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	great sister planet to ementior


[03-Feb-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	idk about your distance requirements


[03-Feb-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	problem for me is tank size


[03-Feb-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no problem, just make stops at MOR


[03-Feb-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and bring a few jerry-cans of fuel on board


[03-Feb-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i feel like im gonna need to pull permits from some bases


[03-Feb-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well, maybe it's better to build some bases out to test what works best


[03-Feb-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and pull when needed


[03-Feb-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah


[03-Feb-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(you have a ton of gases anyway so upgrading base permits shouldn't be that big of a pain in the ass)


[03-Feb-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then again, does @lowstrife use single permits for baes?


[03-Feb-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*bases


[03-Feb-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ah well gtg


[03-Feb-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	cya


[03-Feb-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah dropped kub down to a 500 area base. need a wack of he3 to keep it running tho


[03-Feb-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcco**:	any Corp here accepting new business owners?


[03-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	yes


[03-Feb-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**castrothemexican**:	whats the draw of joining a corp?


[03-Feb-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Dividends.  If someone in your corp is the governor of a planet then you get a cut of the taxes collected.


[03-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	also 10% base production bonus on corp planet HQ


[03-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	mmhmm. corps can help out with building projects and base expansion as well


[03-Feb-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Dividends and the corp HQ are the mechanical benefits. Generally being more likely to get good intra-corps deal is the non-mechanical aspect of it. Outside of that, corps have no notable function so far.


[03-Feb-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah unless the devs decide to wack something in


[03-Feb-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	looking to buy 50 water in LM...


[03-Feb-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You can buy it on the Verdant LM for 20% below CX price.


[04-Feb-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I wouldn't say no to a 50er batch of cheap AMM

[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I'll buy


[04-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Post a buy on the LM.  If it fits it ships.


[04-Feb-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	already have a buy for 500 at 100 for H


[04-Feb-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Swordofdmslaying**:	still have


[04-Feb-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Got it.  Yeah, there's room for 40 more.


[04-Feb-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I was able to squeeze another 46 on if you want that too.


[04-Feb-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	thanks I use H pretty fast with fuel and plastic production


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	my OCD cant handle it any more.  i have 1 extra MAI...up in LM for everyone's favourite price.


[04-Feb-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Cheaper but less efficient.  You make more profit using the GAL recipe.


[04-Feb-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Woohoo!  I got some cheap MAI!


[04-Feb-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	lol...and now all my ingredients are in muttiples of 4...ahhh.


[04-Feb-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	fair point but I'm not selling fuel for profit outside supporting upkeep I use to help CORP and planet trade I mean I sell at 9u in CORP so cheaper is better for me


[04-Feb-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	and I appreciate you selling fuel here...ty


[04-Feb-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	your welcome I'll lower LM fuel soon hopefully just needing to stockpile money for HQ building


[04-Feb-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	(CORP HQ)


[04-Feb-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[04-Feb-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	now I get why you're selling NL.NC1


[04-Feb-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(on the LM)


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Oops I used some of the LDE I made (some for selling others for danakil base)


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah so you can make it into cheaper LDE


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You need LDE for RDE.NC1


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	need TCL too though


[04-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	KV.NC1


[04-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gridley**:	all above my paygrade still...


[04-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	problem is that no-one makes TCL


[04-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah


[04-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	well they do but in other CXs I believe


[04-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think I know why


[04-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Chlorine is running dry at all CX's


[04-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	yeah that why I want a corp mate mine hal


[04-Feb-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Well @FireFreak got me to set up a HAL base on Griffonstone to make CL.NC1 for him


[04-Feb-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	opening in a few hours


[04-Feb-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	nice


[04-Feb-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Once I've "paid" the base off I might be able to get you some CL


[04-Feb-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I'm running this base remotely for him)


[04-Feb-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	i.e he provides consumables and I provide CL


[04-Feb-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Let me check how much CL I need to make before the loan has been repaid


[04-Feb-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	550x CL to go


[04-Feb-23 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and after that, I'd provide a week's worth of CL in exchange for consumables/fabs every month


[04-Feb-23 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	if anyone need RSE selling 2 on LM (for like a HBC) to support more materials for more Rprefabs


[04-Feb-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I make lots of TCL


[04-Feb-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	what your sell price


[04-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It looks like the historical price is around 2300 but lately it has been selling close to 4000.  Benten bid is currently 3000 so we'll go with that.  I don't make much extra TCL but i could switch to making more.  How much do you need?


[04-Feb-23 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	need 160 for HQs RDE after that not much going to use it to make KV


[04-Feb-23 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	hmmm like >10 a day at full speed


[04-Feb-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I could probably swing that.  Coming from Griffonstone.  Will take a bit to up production then ship it over.  If you're in a hurry and can pick up I have a bunch at Orm.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'm always in the market for rfabs.


[04-Feb-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	I can do 1 RDE for every 10 TCL if that sound good after I start production


[04-Feb-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swordofdmslaying**:	anyway I'll setup a new TCL on market for when ever you can swing some TCL by


[04-Feb-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	is Verdant a water-extraction only planet for you?


[04-Feb-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or did you arbitrage from other cx's


[04-Feb-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't make H2O for sale at all.


[04-Feb-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The 20k I have is 100% resale


[04-Feb-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Thats why I'm saying it'll go down to 30.


[04-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The price right now is highly inflated - not by me - but by Niegrozny.


[04-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	Can more experienced players check my math:


[12-Feb-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	I think carbon production is significantly loss making when the opportunity cost of what I could be using my farms for - does that sound right?


[12-Feb-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	No. Carbon Farming is probably the single most profitable starter industry RN.


[12-Feb-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	There might be an argument that HER farming is slightly more profitable... but blanket statement that any farming is better than making carbon from the plants seems incorrect.


[12-Feb-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	My maths must be wrong


[12-Feb-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Try explaining what you did to calculate that result. My guess is that you've not necessarily made a calc mistake, but didn't consider some aspect of the game.


[12-Feb-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	Ok, two examples:


[12-Feb-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	Assuming building time is the limiting factor (as my capital is limited).


[12-Feb-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	HER. I can make 4.14 per day from two farmsteads. This nets approx 9.8k per day after consumables direct costs (DDT) taken into account


[12-Feb-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	C: HCP is quickest to make (I can make 20 per day). Even if i can turn all of this into C (I don't have the incinerator capacity for that yet), I'll only net £9.2k ish


[12-Feb-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	I think this accounts for all costs except for transport


[12-Feb-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	(transport may well be relevant here. C is likley to be easy to sell on LM, HER probably less so and I would need to buy DDT, again may not be available from LM)


[12-Feb-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I would throw in that GRN is actually faster to produce than HCP, at twice the water cost (which however is irrelevantly small, since you can produce water @


[12-Feb-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	~7/u on Verdant). But in general, you're correct that, if you only got FRMs, obviously HER is a bit more profitable. It does add the need to procure DDT though, and it's demand is not as virtually ever-expanding as C.


[12-Feb-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	HER is only used in a few recipes, C is mandatory for metallurgy and large parts of Chemistry. Try CXPC HER.NC1 and check the amount sold per day. It's not much.


[12-Feb-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	Thanks - all helpful pointers


[12-Feb-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Also note for HER you'll probably have to sell at BID, not ASK, since, as a new player, you probably can't afford producing HER with expensive inputs, and then having it lay around on CX for a week until somebody buys it. Selling it instantly vs BID migth be necessary, and then you only get 2500 per piece. That might tank the profitability.


[12-Feb-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	One thought though the transfer pricing is important here I think? Sure I can make water for 6.44/u but when I use to produce something else I'm foregoing the ~22 profit from selling it


[12-Feb-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	as long as ou use farms, that fast turns into a rounding error


[12-Feb-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the water output of a single rig is quite high compared to most farm recipes


[12-Feb-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it is very differnt once you go into hyroponics, but farms... you are better off occasionally doing your own food AND DRINING WATER - you WILL have a surplus


[12-Feb-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	Thanks - all helpful


[12-Feb-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**benngunn**:	At least I know I'm thinking about the right things I guess


[12-Feb-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	^ Technically you can produce water for sale, but it's a low cost low profit thing. Compared to the profit the higher production chains generate. If you want to go dedicated RIG-spam on Verdant to mass produce H2O, that's a valid approach though


[12-Feb-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	It is a PROFITABLE approach, but it is not THAT profitable compared to others


[12-Feb-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you are WAY better to do SOMETHING with the water - even if it is just drinking water


[12-Feb-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	And yeah, @benngunn you seem to have the gist of it. As I said initially: probably no error in the math, just missed that (i.e.) HER doesn't have a strong demand market, as anybody who actually needs it tends to produce themselves.


[12-Feb-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Also, on a personal advice note, you may still want to go with HER rather than INC. I'm fully expecting the C market to crash in the next few weeks, because too many new Carbon-farming bases popped up at Prism (one of the key candidates for that). So investing in C production *now* might be a risky investment. Though the price for C is still far higher than what I assumed it to become 2 weeks ago, so maybe it's not crashing *that* hard (or at all).


[12-Feb-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	haha. prism base for C is maybe a decent idea - would allow me to movemy C production from Vallis out and install more iron production


[12-Feb-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mr.iakio**:	Any recommendations for where to start expanding for a new player that picked carbon farmer?


[12-Feb-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mr.iakio**:	I was thinking chemicals and polymers, but they to not seem really profitable given the circumstances.


[12-Feb-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mr.iakio**:	Now I'm thinking maxing the initial permit here in Verdant, and then moving to some other planet and start some other production chain?


[12-Feb-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	705c would be a good choice


[12-Feb-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Move the C chain off


[12-Feb-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Prism is good fofr the incinerators, Midway is good for Food factories


[12-Feb-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	then you COULD start some iron production somewhere (using C and O - O is good here) and make your own Pp1 parts - those cost a lot and you need them soon


[12-Feb-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	There are basically 2 directions - one: expand to new products, 2, expand by neutralizing cost. i.e. I did iron initially, then went C to offset that cost, now am doing DW and RAT to offset that cost. Same turnover mostly (I do sell some surplus) but my profit margin per sale is WAY up


[12-Feb-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@mr.iakio ye, the important part is maxing out your base first, before setting up a new one. The critical limiting factor initially is liquidity, thus making RoI the primary goal. You achieve that by building profitable cheap industry on your first base. Once you start expanding to other planets, HQ upgrade costs (for permits) become the limiting factor, so that's when you switch to optimizing for profit per area, rather than RoI. Also keep in mind tearing down buildings is cheap: You get back 100% of the construction, minus whatever you would be paying for repairs. So there's essentially no loss for moving industries later on.


[12-Feb-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Yup. A base is expensive - besides the transport cost for everything, run an estaimate on the price of the base building (which does NOTHING).

**noobmcnoob**:	Is there any way to get a fuel saving engine in my ship without pro?


[12-Feb-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**noobmcnoob**:	Sadface


[12-Feb-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	So 8k round trip then


[12-Feb-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Also, ship engines are the key cost of a ship, ballpark > 2million. So when you consider getting a 'more efficient' engine, you might as well get a new ship :P


[12-Feb-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	Ok


[12-Feb-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Yeah. Not sure what you do, but unless yo uburn fuel like mad the FTL fuel is not a major cost to start with. Definitely not when you consider the capital cost of a better engine


[12-Feb-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	@teknova you may want to check local market on midway - that is a place that has food production as focus. i think most producers would do agriculture here, then ship the goods for processing over

[16-Feb-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	there is only 22 bases on midway and 257 on Verdant - so lots of food production on Verdant - way more than Midway


[16-Feb-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not so sure - see, I started very recently and I am already planning a split. Agri here, then further processing on midway, taking the 25% bonus here for agri, there for Food production


[16-Feb-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	"I started very recently" 179 days ago :P

**Alblaka**:	(I assume it was an inactive account?)


[16-Feb-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	No, I mean on verdant. 2nd base. A 2nd base is a big step - stupid stuff costs an arm and a leg


[16-Feb-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ah, fair point. But yeah, when you can afford a 2nd base, a 3rd doesn't seem like a big deal anymore, so the split comes natural. Source: Made elaborate plans to split my INCs from Verdant to Prism, got loans and investment, then suddenly had 3 bases because why not just move FP off as well.

[16-Feb-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep they do


[17-Feb-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Aye. We switched to using a spreadsheet for corp-internal construction orders. Then you merely throw down a lot of instantly executed contracts once the order is done. Roadmap mentions custom multi-part contracts, those would resolve that mess.


[17-Feb-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they should add multi-good contracts (both shipping and provisioning), that'd resolve most of the problems

[20-Feb-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	be nice to try and get a hyp up and running to make the caf beans up


[20-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	The current price makes production of COF.NC1 prohibitive from a profit standpoint.  There is a 15k Sell Order that holds the price at 500 for Coffee.  This has never adjusted from the water price manipulation


[20-Feb-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	With NS.NC1 costing about 700, and the total water for 1 Coffee production costing about 1,100 at current rate for H2O, without factoring consumables it costs 1,800 for 3x COF.NC1.  Which sells for 500 max. -300 loss


[20-Feb-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Almost certainly everyone making CAF isn't buying H2O on CX but is either buying locally or extracting themselves - H2O is just one of those markets that the CX doesn't represent the actual price because it is rarely shipped to a CX.


[20-Feb-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Also, the CAF recipe produces 2 CAF, and you only need 1 CAF per 3 COF. I'm not sure all your math is right there, at current CX offer rates on H2O and NS, the raw cost of 1 COF is 290.8/u. Plus consumables (not counting the 1 DW per 1 COF in the recipe)


[20-Feb-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	I reduced my price calculation to factor only 1 CAF production instead of 2


[20-Feb-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	I get what you are referring to but moving H2O.NC1 to the CX and selling direct nets more revenue than turning it into DW and CAF


[20-Feb-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daylonne**:	If that sell order of 15k coffee for 500 a piece changed to 600 or 700 it would allow some room for profit based on the water prices.  Just in general from a profit perspective it's not worth the time to produce COF atm because of that sell order keeping the price down.

**Xk37**:	Just make sure you ask actual people. Sometimes the bugs try to pass themselves off as humans. If you see someone in a trenchcoat and a hat, well, let's just say they can fool me two or three times but NEVER AGAIN!

**DogeConomy**:	if you buy pro license, it'll downgrade to basic after the subscription period ends


[23-Feb-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dyson**:	That is less than optimal


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	anyone wanting to ship some of them back to verdant?


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	FE or FEO?


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FE


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	probably not then since you asked that question


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Ahhh sorry, I have been watching Vallis pop waiting on an opening and I could have sworn I saw 6-8 LM for 100 FE @ 400/u


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Got them for 380/u


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	xd


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there was an opening for 5 people 7 days ago


[23-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	That is a lot of iron.


[23-Feb-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	1200 tonnes of iron? ( I mentioned it above)


[24-Feb-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but to answer your question- STOs


[24-Feb-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	ok 1200t of iron is nothing compared to 1200 units of iron xD


[24-Feb-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I don't have any STOs there tho)


[24-Feb-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I built only one STO thinking it would be enough... but its not :(


[24-Feb-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	for me it's okay, because I spread my operations across different bases


[24-Feb-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and sell stuff fairly quickly


[24-Feb-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Bfabs and Lfabs do be selling quick tho


[24-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I like to keep stockpiles of my inputs and consumables for few weeks time to insulate from cx problems


[24-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same


[24-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but as soon as I got my first STO the problem was fixed


[24-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	thats what I thought at first as well


[24-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	because I never had the money after that to buy so much inputs


[24-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	now I'm constantly at limit, even demolished extractor to reduce FEO production


[24-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	as I was going into higher workforce tiers


[24-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I know a guy that wants ore to smelt


[24-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I'm free licence, cant use contracts


[24-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh sad ;(


[24-Feb-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	good news for Verdant players is that warehouse rent is free, but you can only get 2k space


[24-Feb-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I maxed my warehouse at the peak of my storage problems


[24-Feb-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@doge whats the reason for settling Griffonstone


[24-Feb-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	NA.NC1 and espc. CL.NC1


[24-Feb-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	yea I produce almost 20 CL per day but on circe thats very close compared to griffonstone


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you got 2 bases in moria region so its kinda wierd you settled there


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm helping another player out running this base


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	so its loan deal?


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	free deal


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I keep the NA


[24-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	good for me because I need to make glass for my Lfabs


[24-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you can just buy NA, its so cheap


[24-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	na, passive income ;)


[24-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	depends if you transport it here or sell there


[24-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I make NA there and sell at antares


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then buy it back (instant teleportation/transport) at moria


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	cheaper at moria too


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I make my own NA and my own glass all in this region


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so I make a profit on the side


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	so your friend takes care of all consumables?


[24-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I just do nothing besides click the fulfill button on the contracts they send me


[24-Feb-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	If it's just for repairs it seems like you could just buy on the cx because your production won't be halted while you're waiting for the materials

**Kubernetes**:	any suggestions for a nearby planet to put my food processing plants on so I can have more agri here on verdant?


[27-Feb-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Since there are a lot of you doing shipping contracts all the time, would anyone be interested in buying BHPs off of the Verdant local market at a lower rate than the CX?


[28-Feb-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	@wakanda I think many people will use mutliepl licenses to expand verdant - but it iless effective.


[28-Feb-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Midway and Primus as production sites (Primus for incinerators) seems t obe a relatively new concept


[28-Feb-23 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Do you mean Prism? Or is Primus another one?


[28-Feb-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	prism, sorry


[28-Feb-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you look at the production bonui of every place and you realize just how much you can gain - on top, 1 license bases are way more efficient


[28-Feb-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	1st license is 500 units of space, the next 2 are 250 each. Once you hit that as limit (and base expansion gets expensive) there is benefit in more smaller bases - at the cost of logistics complexity


[28-Feb-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Anyone want some AMM?  I have 1358 available at 85/u.  Just send a contract or post a buy on the LM.

**ZenWhisper**:	Had to sell my rigs for space and build the AFabs 11 jumps away but I finally built an Orchard.  Whew.


[03-Mar-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Oh and build a water planet base too.  Speaking of which, anyone know what H2O sales would go for here?  I rarely see any on the LM and since I have to fly in some of my 1k H2O/day I'd rather sell some here than on MOR.


[04-Mar-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Well I sort out my own water use myself for farming and consumables production


[04-Mar-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'd think most other people would also do the same, given thatt rigs don't cost much to run, especially on verdant where most consumables can be made in house


[04-Mar-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	most people do their own water UNTIL they haveto import


[04-Mar-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	also doing your own water turns inefficient when you need more than 1 license and start to optimize license (as license 2 and 3 only give you half the land of license 1). but yeah, I think most people have their own water sorted out - either with rigs or by importing


[04-Mar-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	any surplus is easily converted to dw and sold of as such


[04-Mar-23 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	almost everyone here produces their own water here.  Sometimes people run a little short though so you could sell water on LM at Moria bid, which is 22 right now, in small batches of 100-200 each would sell the easiest


[04-Mar-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	this is one thing i do not understand. I started like that - doing my own water. Now, about 6 weeks later, I am preparing to move processing and water production off planet


[04-Mar-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	simply more effective to do processing off planet and import water


[04-Mar-23 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you're still doing your own water though xd


[04-Mar-23 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	makes no difference in demand for water on Verdant, since you're solving your own problems

[04-Mar-23 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	any rats


[04-Mar-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	RAT.NC1


[04-Mar-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	otherwise I should be good to tide this price spike out for a week more


[04-Mar-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I stop by Verdant quite often these days but rarely stay more than 5 minutes and almost always have 500t ready to go.  I don't produce enough RATs for all my bases and I was stalling my buys until it got critical.  I just paid 150 each for a bunch of RATs.  It's like a PrUN nightmare of overpayment under duress.


[04-Mar-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	all the new players i assume were eating the overproduction and emptying the market


[04-Mar-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	harder on new players really.  I shouldn't complain.


[04-Mar-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I paid about 80 each for my first 2 months I think or something like that


[04-Mar-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and I'm covering about 60% of my total RAT needs here on Verdant.  Even with that, I just spent way more on RATs than ever before.


[04-Mar-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I thank heaven identified RAT and DW as apossible issue and am now running a good rsurplus AND expanding fast


[04-Mar-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I mean Verdant covers about 60% of the total RAT needs for all 3 of my bases.


[04-Mar-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	not just for itself of course


[04-Mar-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	nice, main purpose of this base is INC inputs so DW, RATs, and COF are being produced in moderate quantities.


[04-Mar-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Also, O for all my smelting all comes from here


[04-Mar-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	plus extra to sell


[04-Mar-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	So it covers all my C, all my O, COF, KOM, most of my RAT and DW needs, and some other more specialized stuff like RCO for COT.  This base covers a lot for me.


[04-Mar-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, not doing RCO and KOM etc. FOR NOW - and now moving water out to another place, as I do food productions.


[04-Mar-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	incinerators still on vailliant, that is like next phase ;)


[04-Mar-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ah, damn planet names. yo know what i mean ;)


[04-Mar-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	based on the weights its lighter to move the GRN, MAI, and HCP to Vallis and Celebdil than the finished C, I have the INCs on those planets.


[04-Mar-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, that is ONE element


[04-Mar-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	more efficient


[04-Mar-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the other is that space is at a premium, but ship space is not


[04-Mar-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	so, moving bases to another planet allows me to have more - and with more bonus - while I can upgrade ships, build new ships or use shipping ocntracts


[04-Mar-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it's close but something like 8t of inputs makes 8.8t of C


[04-Mar-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	so, youa re right that it is more logistics efficient, but you could handle this while you take advantage of another base with another 500 units of space


[04-Mar-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	actually 7.6t turns into 8.8t of C


[04-Mar-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	may adjust in the future but I cannot currently build another base


[04-Mar-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ah. yeah. i decied that RAT and DW are going t obe big enough as products I see how far I can scale it, with midway-c being the center of production soon


[04-Mar-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	nice bonus there


[04-Mar-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I've heard that plan and I think you can make bank on it.


[04-Mar-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it also allows me to use 5 experts on every base in one field


[04-Mar-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	nearly 30% more agri, food processing etc.


[04-Mar-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	my main two bases are kind of multi-purpose so I am not taking advantage of piling up the efficiency bonuses and scaling up big.  I couldn't do that early and not even sure I want to.


[04-Mar-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I kind of like covering almost all of my own needs so I am mostly insulated from these price spikes

**purpdrag**:	yeah, same person.  I can only think the 3500 one is more urgent to actually get shipped and the 2500 one doesn't really matter as much.

**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	probably reinforcing your supplies for your workers so that you can try to expand your operations without getting yourself into a supply shortage immediately after


[05-Mar-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	same with any other inputs you might need, depending on what you're doing


[05-Mar-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and if you haven't yet gotten your workers luxury supplies, like coffee and padded overalls for pioneers, then it's always worth investing in, it pretty much always pays off in the output tradeoff

[05-Mar-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@noobmcnoob Everything Opalesce-Spectrum said is spot on in my book.  Just to basically repeat and add detail, I recommend trying to build up at least a 3-5 day supply of all your inputs and consumables including COF and PWO.  COF is debatable but I like to keep my workers at 100% satisfaction.  And while doing that also be thinking about future plans and build strategies and what buildings will be next so you can also start planning on gathering those materials.


[05-Mar-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	thanks


[05-Mar-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	many of us plan and do builds as a set of buildings corresponding to each new hab.  So example is maybe HB1, RIG, FRM.  First drop the HB1 for additional 100 Pio capacity, then the RIG and FRM and the 80 new workers will start right away (on this planet anyway). Total cost will be 18 BSE, 8 BBH, etc., etc.,   Gather all the materials, whether by build or buy, then drop all three buildings 1,2,3.  Pay attn and prepare for the the increased consumption as you add workers so you don't get caught short on that part.

**Alblaka**:	Hmmmm, I'm looking to expand my logistical network, but need a ship for that my corp can't spare. If there's any (probably newer) companies on Verdant that have a ship sitting idle, and expect that ship to remain idle for the coming weeks, please message me, and we can hash out a well-paid recurring shipping sidejob.

**Blacksail**:	fuel refining planet too


[06-Mar-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	(albeit with a lower concentration of O/H2O)


[09-Mar-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i do have plans to build more ships in the future to compensate


[09-Mar-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	some for gas and other solids


[09-Mar-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I think your base might become jammed up if the ships are not ready by the time your base is fully operational


[09-Mar-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	planning on getting a vcb for one of my ships and a wcb for the other


[09-Mar-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Anyway Prism is experiencing some PIO shortages, so you should check the POPR before dropping your base


[09-Mar-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	prism is a long way off


[09-Mar-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i have plans mainly for verdant and harpina at this current moment


[09-Mar-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	right. as long as the logistics don't scuttle your plans or create stress :)


[09-Mar-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i dont have a load of supply chains to screw with when it fully up and running. mainly cause ill be clumping bases somewhat close together

**noobmcnoob**:	put in local market


[09-Mar-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I don't have Pro either :(


[09-Mar-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	can you ship without pro?


[09-Mar-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Yes, if you have Basic (used to have Pro)


[09-Mar-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	ah I see ok


[09-Mar-23 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	as a beginner: read the help toics - to right of the screen, 9 topics


[09-Mar-23 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and watch some tutorials


[09-Mar-23 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I highly recommend buying Pro for at least 1 month. Then after that you can get by with Basic privaleges for a while before needing Pro again.


[09-Mar-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	ok


[09-Mar-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep, good idea


[09-Mar-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	sitting on 38 k but i want to keep 10-20k reserve for each base


[09-Mar-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	~57k in liquid assets


[09-Mar-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	39k here


[09-Mar-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Oh my, Blacksail.  You are twice my account age and you only have 39k liquid assets.  What calamity befell you?  Or do you have 10000 Carbon sitting in a CX?


[09-Mar-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Maybe he is good at investing his money to make more money.


[09-Mar-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am embarrassed to say I have more than that because it means I'm sitting on it too lazy to put it to work right away.


[09-Mar-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	For the first 60 days I averaged having 700 NCC cash on hand at all times.


[09-Mar-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	just about enough to cover the next 12 hours prod fees


[09-Mar-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it has just recently gotten away from me though and it now jumps into the 100s of thousands after big sells and takes time to figure out what to do with it and spend it wisely


[09-Mar-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Well, sure, that's the first 60 days.  Every credit can be put in use.  But you need a % of your operation to handle the churn which is small to start but grows.  Between my last comment and this one I paid out 15k for shipping contracts.


[09-Mar-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	My whole operation could lock up if I dipped down below 39k free cash.


[09-Mar-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	true everything scales up, typically though much of the "invested" cash is still liquid effectively in the form of placed buy orders that can be canceled as needed.


[09-Mar-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so it is still available if you are just trying to do some buying and selling with it


[09-Mar-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	right now though I am honestly mostly just sitting on cash as I plan my next moves


[09-Mar-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I have enough now to start thinking about a ship upgrade and starting to collect those parts so doing early planning on that


[09-Mar-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and I am overdue on needing it for my oeprations


[09-Mar-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	my two starters are running continuously now and not quite covering my own needs


[09-Mar-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and I have had mixed luck offering shipping contracts out


[09-Mar-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	seems like my "3 day" shipping contracts often take 5-7 days to deliver and nothing I can do about it


[09-Mar-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@ZenWhisper they restarted (this is their 2nd attempt)


[09-Mar-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so really their run is half as long as yours


[09-Mar-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Purpdrag, might want to make sure to block those people. The least you can do is make sure they cant nab and delay shipping ads for you, again.


[09-Mar-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	3 days = 2x 3 days


[09-Mar-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	un-intentional/poor game design by the devs


[09-Mar-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ye, no, it's not considered correct by etiquette to exceed the time frame the contract is advertised for, even if shoddy implementation lets you do that. So, as I said, straight up block. Exceptions might apply to a <7d player who legit does his first shipping and didn't know better.


[09-Mar-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I didn't know I could do that and that is exactly a "new feature" I was hoping for.


[09-Mar-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so if I just "BlockUser" they can't accept any contracts from me?


[09-Mar-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I thought that was just for chat blocking


[09-Mar-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Check the LMBL command


[09-Mar-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Thanks. I checked it out and did my first block.  More like a test because I think this person probably quit already, but it's working.


[09-Mar-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	still learning, I think it is time for me to scan the entire CMD list for other hidden gems.


[09-Mar-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I block those players who pick up my shipments right at the edge of the 3 days, and take another 3 days to deliver, especially if they don't bother to provide any reasons for that


[09-Mar-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	^^^ yup that's the most common and basic reason I want to do it as well and happy to learn this


[10-Mar-23 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	oh okay


[10-Mar-23 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	I brought back my HYF and added a second one both this week.


[10-Mar-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Can we talk business regarding HYFs?


[10-Mar-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**noobmcnoob**:	I think I am going to make HYF but what would I make at it?


[10-Mar-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	CAF.


[10-Mar-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	It's the key item that only HYFs can produce. Past that, possibly ALG/MUS/HCP, with the caveeat that those, or their euivalent counterparts can be made cheaper (but not faster) at FRMs


[10-Mar-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Not sure about cheaper as in profit per unit of land, in particular the moment your land gets scarce - producing MORE alows more to be processed further down the road. but yeah, CAF is the one item at the start you are stuck doing in HYF

[17-Mar-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	FF.NC1


[17-Mar-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FF has no margin


[17-Mar-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hence higher price


[17-Mar-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Interesting. Because of the HE3?


[17-Mar-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[17-Mar-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I don't have a HE3/TS base yet


[17-Mar-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Ive never even looked, whats the best closest planet for that?


[17-Mar-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	I do know they are fairly rare


[17-Mar-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	DW-456g


[17-Mar-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	70% concentration compared to the highest concentration of HE3 in the game


[17-Mar-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Of course...INS. the cockblock of pretty much everything good


[17-Mar-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	XH-594c (Cortez) - Gold and TS-> HE3


[17-Mar-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Alblaka**:	@Blacksail I would happily buy up that water, but I'm not going to click through 7 contacts per day. Please scale them up to at least 500er sizes :P


[17-Mar-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Well then don't xd, you can't make everyone happy all at once lol

[17-Mar-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	... It's neither of those.


[17-Mar-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	threw up a 500 ad


[17-Mar-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	<3


[17-Mar-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm looking at 1350 H2O/d input, so at that scale 100er ads are... a bit too small scale clickedity.


[17-Mar-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	was doing it mainly for the smaller peeps


[17-Mar-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	In that case, fair enough, carry on:D


[17-Mar-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	though i will throw up large ones when i get the chance


[17-Mar-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(Though I would hope smaller players are just RIGging their own water... that only becomes a problem once your base gets too full)


[17-Mar-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah im trying to get rid of most of the 3k water i have lol. seven rigs fill base up quick


[17-Mar-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	planning another 9 latter on


[17-Mar-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	later*


[17-Mar-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I have 7 RIGs and use about 95% of H2O on site.  Generally, carry the rest to Moria for sale when I can.  My excess is only about 100 or 200 per week. That's tiny, but if anyone wants some sometimes I would be happy to sell at Moria bid and my batch size would normally be 100.  I'll throw one up now and see what happens.


[17-Mar-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i might have to accelerate my danakil base construction


[17-Mar-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	why?


[17-Mar-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Never mind, already plenty on LM at 20 each and I don't need to do that price right now.


[17-Mar-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah xd fierce competition right?


[17-Mar-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	just been offered a long term contract to supply water to a player here on verdant


[17-Mar-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	let me guess, @Alblaka


[17-Mar-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah. i need to ramp up water production...a lot


[17-Mar-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they have a ton of HYFs


[17-Mar-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I may be able to assist


[17-Mar-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	check corp chat


[17-Mar-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Hard to overestimate how much water HYFs use.  I have two and just those two use more than 4 RIGs worth of H2O.

***Alternate_Rebirth** left.*


[17-Mar-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I do a mix in the HYFs that includes about 30% of production time on CAF.  Water usage would be way higher for someone doing mostly or all CAF.


[17-Mar-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Only gets worse when you add 600 area worth of FRMS pumping out GRN for your INC base... individually the farms dont take much... but it sums up


[17-Mar-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	my hydroponic base will have 18 hyf


[17-Mar-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	you would need 2 or 3 size 500 bases here doing nothing but habs and rigs to supply those


[17-Mar-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	its a 1k base


[17-Mar-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	plus its on xg-326d which has the second highest extraction rate of water per day (like 0.01 from the top planet)


[17-Mar-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	is the top planet also non liquid? Because rigs use 10 instead of 15 space ;)


[17-Mar-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and the iso - just saying i got warned like mad to put water here, but it makes a lot of sense with limited shipping ;)


[17-Mar-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	both planets are ice


[17-Mar-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	top three are ice with the 4th being a fertile planet


[17-Mar-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	the 1st, 3rd and 4th are really far from me. why ive gon with the ice planet as its close to me


[17-Mar-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Yea, technically xg-452b is the best h2o planet because you need rigs vs extractors. 2.5 rig vs 1 ext.


[17-Mar-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Which makes the daily collection/area much better. But not needing HSE and TSH is nice.


[17-Mar-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	tsh is 30k a pop atm


[17-Mar-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	sorry, all too much for me. Verdant is a consumption base - I keep 10 days or so supply here, but you would blow it and i have my ships out for too long before they come here again

[21-Mar-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@mast3rd3mon, I produce RATs here but not quite enough for my own bases, so anything I sell here would have to be backfilled with a trip to a CX.  So that said, if the price is right, I could actually spare about 240 right now.


[21-Mar-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I can spare 120 RATs if you want to send Cont @120ea.

**Kuben**:	Greetings fellow corporations of Verdant! Spring is upon us and the bugs are waking from their winter hibernation. Though the cold has taken many of them, they seem unaffected in numbers. As you governor it's been a while since a proper update. Verdant is bigger then ever. The new tax levels are sufficient and our income per week is stable arround 580k. Since we no longer employ any ENG I have stopped the upkeep of Art Gallery saving us some upkeep. I will continue to upgrade the SST, INF and PAR with the surplus. Other than that please let me know if you have any questions or sugestions.


[01-Apr-23 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-23 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Aaaand somebody else apparently direly needed NS too and snatched up the ad. Huh.


[05-Apr-23 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	you can afford to expand lol


[26-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Apr-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and the amounts you can really supply. there is a lot of use here, me thinks


[28-Apr-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	What was just sold was 100 units @ 500 ea. Price will follow Moria CX sell, probably slightly under but not as low as CX buy orders. I will have around 200 units a day to sell, but some of it will just go on the CX as well. Assuming I am not selling it faster than I can ship it here, there will be around 200 units a day.


[28-Apr-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	If demand outstrips supply, that is a good problem I can help solve as well. =P


[28-Apr-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	ye, no point buying it from you over buying from CX then. shipping is irrelevant for 0.5t in per 5+t out


[28-Apr-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	sure, not everyone needs it. there is only 330 units @ 500 on the CX right now, and price has been trending up. NS.NC1 N.NC1 If enough people are using NS here, I imaigne the LM ads will continue to get picked up quickly regardless. ^^ Will see.


[28-Apr-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I can't stop people from burning their profits by buying overpriced inputs.


[28-Apr-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	:o how is the same price as the CX overpriced?


[28-Apr-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	500 for NS is overpriced. Doesn't matte where.


[28-Apr-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	sure, thats fair


[28-Apr-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	=P


[28-Apr-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	You can't produce most goods at that price at a profit.


[28-Apr-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I produce my own NS obviously, but it's also selling at that price so...


[28-Apr-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	As I said, I can't physically stop people from burning their profits by buying overpriced inputs. I can only clearly state it's dumb and anyone considering to pay that much should redo their cost calculation :P


[28-Apr-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	COF is hot right now. Seems there isn't enough production. By my data, NS is basically at the max possible price it can be right now before COF stops being profitable. H2O price is a factor there too but that's relatively stable.


[28-Apr-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	That's assuming COF stays at 630, which is also very high.


[28-Apr-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	But that's been showing no sign of dropping in the price history.


[28-Apr-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'll bail on this conversation now before I get disrespectful.


[28-Apr-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	=) I've been gone for a bit, so, only going off of the data available. Last time I played COF was aroun 250, I don't remember what NS was, but I don't remember NS being traded a ton as most people oroduced their own. Which I assume would still be the case, but the economy is a lot more mature now. Not eveyone has to produce their entire production chian.

**Shyzer**:	hi i wasnt online since 1 year but my old base seems to be gone ? is that possible, cuz i shut everything down before i left so i wouldnt have to pay upkeep. but i had to make a new base (good choice anyway)

**cubblakistan**:	so if you pay for 4 months of pro then die in a car crash, do you get the reminder email as soon as you hit basic or does the timer start when pro ends?

[22-May-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I'm starting a new wave of activity in the Hubur region.  Set up a base at zk-602b (halfway between Verdant and Hubur) that people can use as a pickup/dropoff point.  There will be a fuel depot nearby too.  If you're looking to start an new ventures then consider that area.


[22-May-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-May-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-May-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	not really usually it's more about having more variety on the LM though C rating should be sufficient as not many players that paid for PRO are pirates (a negligible amount)


[01-Jun-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	A is for people with a (recently) spotless record. P is for new companies. Everything else is somebody who recently breached acontract. Less about piracy, more about reliability, so even a B is a red flag (exactly because it'S so easy to stay at A)


[01-Jun-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	again. quite unstable.


[01-Jun-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Keep in mind we're talking Reliability here. Not Stability. Stability is pointless metric because it's super-sensitive to week-to-week changes, in a game where resupply cycles can last a month. Nobody pays attention to Stability, only Activity + Reliability


[01-Jun-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	e.g last week I made a loss of -703k NCC due to me giving out loans and that caused my stability to drop from A to C


[01-Jun-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	If my stability doesn’t keep visiting C then I know I’m not fully investing my cash.

[07-Jun-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Maybe it isn't clear that there is a drop-down menu as there is no little arrow indicating that one exists.  Dev3l, if you click in the space that show the COF recipe [production template] you will get the drop-down that shows the other recipes.


[07-Jun-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I don't know if the game starts you with any of the raw materials that your food processor needs but you definitely start off with everything needed to get going.  That means building a farm to produce agriculture goods which your food processor can turn into RAT (basic rations) or building a Rig to collect H2O (water) which goes into the food processor to become DW (drinking water).


[07-Jun-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dev3l**:	sounds good but still... now I have to wait about 2 days for something to be produced


[07-Jun-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dev3l**:	Is it a game about producing something for a very long time without any purpose?


[07-Jun-23 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It starts off very slow but you grow progressively faster.  Yes, you just set what you need done then wait for it to happen.  There are other things that you can do to keep busy such as shipping contracts and CX arbitrage but most of your time is spent investigating and planning your future development.

**Alblaka**:	@dev3l Given that you start out with some capital, and way too much ships, if you wish to pursue a more active playstyle, you could trade goods from one CX to another (buy something cheap here, sell expensive there). Or invest your starting money into buying parts for another production building or two. But even then that will only give you a couple more clicks to do every few days, so yes, the game IS slow paced like that initially.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	zk-602b is being developed as a hub for a variety of industries.  Halfway between Verdant and Hubur it should open up more trade with that CX as you no longer have to fly the whole way there.  Just dropoff/pickup goods at zk-602b and and have someone else fly it the rest of the way.  If you are interested in setting up new bases I may be willing to sponsor some or all of the cost.  Send me a private message for more info.

[09-Jun-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yes, as long it's recurring, it will generate each one of them in order they go to production


[09-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	and ye, specially since you got recurring order, there isn't any reason not to use but patch sizes, unless you're trying to sort your production ratio between different items

**DrTom**:	Here is how it workd: A task is removed from the list when it is activated and moved into the production building. If the task has teh recurring marker, it is then reentered at the end of the list.


[11-Jun-23 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you can mix and match. Also note that if multiple buildings are unused, the 2nd building will ALSO tryy task 2 an the 3rd building task 2 and 3.


[11-Jun-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I run on a base 25 or o food processors with 3 recurring taks, but when running out of the input for one of them, i have one or max 2 not working andf then the other tasks take over

[30-Jun-23 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, this is the _other_ leg of the trip.  The other day I picked up two of your contracts for sending the empty ship to Moria.  I wanted to get some expansion parts for the base and was happy to find the contracts to defray the costs.


[30-Jun-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Thanks.  I was on vacation last week often outside of cell service and am still cleaning up the mess I left things.  I think I have 16kt in flight at the moment, so if you are later but within deadline there is 0% chance I'll notice.  :)


[30-Jun-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Blacksail**:	they get shifted around for the first wee after you get them. its normal


[14-Jul-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The reason you lost 30 workers is because the buildings you have constructed only require 170.  Once you construct more buildings you will get more workers (assuming you also have enough HABs to support them).


[14-Jul-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You get 200 automatically when you construct the base.  There is a redistribution that occurs once a week.  At that time any workers who don't have jobs will go back into the planetary pool.

[03-Aug-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Seeing the LM ads for NS @ 400/u, I got to wonder: do people pay that much or NS on Verdant? I've got plenty of NS surplus at Moria, and could ship it over here relatively easily :thinking:


[03-Aug-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which ones?


[03-Aug-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Aug-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Looking for a farmer on Verdant who is willing to trade their agricultural goods (BEA, VEG, GRN) in exchange for Pioneer consumables (RAT, DW, COF, OVE, PWO)?


[06-Aug-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(it'll be a weekly trade)


[06-Aug-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	posted 3x 400t/350m^3, 3k NCC, Verdant -> MOR contracts


[06-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh forgot to clarify to avoid errors in communication, I'll give the consumables, you'll give me the Agricultural goods


[06-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the trade will happen locally, no shipping required

**SomeKnight**:	Plants are grown just to be burnt!


[06-Aug-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	ORGANIC MASS MUST BURN!


[06-Aug-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	wasnt carbon farming how the great Ration price spike began ?


[06-Aug-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Most spikes tend to be because of carbon or FP in one form or another.


[06-Aug-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	To little C production? All metal spikes. To little workforce consumables? Prices spike because /everyone/ is in danger of stopping production.


[06-Aug-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	C, RAT + DW are the foundation of everything in Pr:Un

**Zean**:	noobie question is there a way to increase your base size? from 500 to something beyond that?


[07-Aug-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yea you would use more permits to a max of 3. Permit 1 (what you have) is 500, then P2 gets you to 750 and P3 to 1000


[07-Aug-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	from BS you can add/remove permits freely


[07-Aug-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	you have 2 to start with, more will require upgrading the HQ

[07-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	oh ok i think i understand!


[07-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	thank you very much


[07-Aug-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	No problem, lots to learn for sure. Lots of great helpful people here too as you know so just as if your stumped. Cheers


[07-Aug-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	one more if i may...

[07-Aug-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	i was thinking once im wealthy enough to creep to another planet YI-715a will that installation get the same 1 defaulted and 2 additional if i use them for verdant?


[07-Aug-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yes, each planet can have up to 3 permits total. With your permit level being tied to the HQ level +1


[07-Aug-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	oh thank goodness lol


[07-Aug-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	your the best!!


[07-Aug-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	new leaderboard category :)


[07-Aug-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Keep in mind, that 715a is a double red, and will cost more to build on and upkeep. SEA is fairly cheep but TSH will add up (Sea for Low Pressure, TSH for high temp)


[07-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	you would need roughly 700k worth of TSH depending on what you build, and 60k worth of SEA.


[07-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	woah, noted!


[07-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	almost make the juicy iron not worth it!


[07-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	makes*


[07-Aug-23 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Not in the least, the CU maybe but with the lack or pop it's not a popular place. I pull CU on EM-929b


[07-Aug-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	yep far better places to get iron from


[07-Aug-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	legit taking notes and ill quote you! "lots to learn"


[07-Aug-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I think low pressure is the only one you can eat the cost of without much thought, as SEA is pretty cheap.


[07-Aug-23 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	YI-683c would be the closest alternative only needing SEA although the COGC is Electronics.


[07-Aug-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	im at some point going to start planting O extractors so need to figure what to react it with lol that i can easily get at


[07-Aug-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	hoping the water orders never evaporate or im in hot water!! lol


[07-Aug-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	FEO is low use for Oxygen where as STL and CU use LOTS


[07-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	If your selling water on the LM you will likely continue to have orders to fill


[07-Aug-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	woohoo! :)


[07-Aug-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	im also looking forward to 5 experts im managed to pick up 2 so far!


[07-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	im assuming its a real time timer that in dependent on it having the most production lanes?


[07-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	You will get there but it takes lots or time depending on how many bui you have that use them


[07-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	sorry? bui?


[07-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	buildings


[07-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	oh! drr


[07-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	BUI is the code for the buffer like BUI RIG


[07-Aug-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	You can do 20 RIG and 10 EXT but the O accumulates very quickly and doesnt really sell well. Better to do 30 RIG, water will always sell well here because there is not a convenient close source like Bouher


[07-Aug-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	and the FRM are usually upgraded to HYF which are really H2O hungry


[07-Aug-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	ive got 11 RIG 0 EXT but oh thatll change!


[07-Aug-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	you wouldn't use EXT on Verdant


[07-Aug-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	i took a look at the HYF and was surprised the time shaved and water increased


[07-Aug-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	COL for O


[07-Aug-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Yeah, still not worth it even if you have a 10 SME base on Vallis. In sitting on 1000's of O and ended up going 5x FP, 10x HYF, 10x RIG


[07-Aug-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	and how does the NS effect your profitability?


[07-Aug-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Someone dumped 10k on the market not long ago very cheap


[07-Aug-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed i pull Oxygen close to my CU base and even that with 6 COL is overpowered and i run it without Luxury items


[07-Aug-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	looks like its GTU hangout day lol


[07-Aug-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	i didnt do it!


[07-Aug-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	lol


[07-Aug-23 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	and right now it is still kinda cheap, I dont dump my excess on the cx yet, but even with 10 HYF its accumulating


[07-Aug-23 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	lol


[07-Aug-23 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	10K oygen onto the market? @valencia


[07-Aug-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	sorry 10k N


[07-Aug-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	im running 10 RIG, 21 FP and 13 FRM just doing rat lol


[07-Aug-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	might of been me


[07-Aug-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	oh N nope not me


[07-Aug-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	dont know if its worth switching to HYF


[07-Aug-23 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I can see that.


[07-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	You would have to plot it out an see


[07-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Without a source of N though it could be costly if the CX when high on it


[07-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	BAH NS*


[07-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I started with just a couple for CAF but just kept on


[07-Aug-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	i like the low logistics ot the moment, NS will be just another com i need to worry about


[07-Aug-23 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	brb friends


[07-Aug-23 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	this is why i was asking about the NS, when you need such high volume it can really damage profitabliity


[07-Aug-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	unless you make your own i guess. maybe thatll be my next mission lol


[07-Aug-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed, i run 20 HYF on circe and it eats 52/Day. ended up dropping a base on montem to make it and save myself the worry.


[07-Aug-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Still haul in N and H2O though


[07-Aug-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I had the CHM on Montem anyway so N is really the only input I have to buy


[07-Aug-23 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	LST is on planet and water is back to normal prices


[07-Aug-23 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	i really hate having to go to cx for anything. thats why im stuck on T1 production mostly


[07-Aug-23 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah, i was making it on a second permit right on Circe but hauling in LST was a PITA. so i move to montem.


[07-Aug-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Working on getting setup to make DDT, since thats what i need for Verdant as HER is all i grow here.


[07-Aug-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	hahaha


[07-Aug-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I was literally just looking at that


[07-Aug-23 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	id love to get into the KOF game but thats also a pain


[07-Aug-23 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Once i have that sorted, i will flip Pyrgos from RAT making to just HER as well so i can fill out the WB-675c FP planet


[07-Aug-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	COF is getting easyer to come by atleast


[07-Aug-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	That is why I was looking at that, KOM is probably my biggest input I have to buy


[07-Aug-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	@Dark were you meaning COF or KOM or both with that KOF lol


[07-Aug-23 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	it is easy to get ahold of but it eats into the profit margins. thats why i have 2 bases just doing RAT and DW for own consumption and the surplus goes to cx


[07-Aug-23 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	@crash lol, COF..... its early ok, brain still waking up


[07-Aug-23 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	For me i think COF is my largest purchase $$ wise currently


[07-Aug-23 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkWatcher**:	my only issue is ive taken up the best planets with H2O for my DW and RAT. so gotta find another good one for that


[07-Aug-23 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	your missing Etherwind, loads of water and fertile


[07-Aug-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	you need good transport but think about a dedicated FP base, midway c is close and SEA is cheap


[07-Aug-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Oh its already built to what i need to process the output from here well most of it, letting it add up to have a stockpile so i can move it once i have a full shipload so WCB for mow and LCB in time.


[07-Aug-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I was wrong COF is #2 for me behind DW based off the current CX pricing.


[07-Aug-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Time to go figure out how many PF i need on etherwind to solve that lol


[07-Aug-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I was actually looking at Saladin since we have a corp source of AMM nearby


[07-Aug-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Thats a long flight lol


[07-Aug-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	for the HER


[07-Aug-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	yah 2 days from Verdant in a starter ship but the gov on Rhazes has fuel too, and the CX isnt that unreasonable


[07-Aug-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	tried expanding into that area before but the economics and logistics didnt work out. Now that both my starters are upgraded to WCB well thats why I was looking at DDT. Running the numbers


[07-Aug-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Ideally I would of liked Promitor but that will never happen until reset so ... since its a 2 day trip to there or Avalon anyway /shrug


[07-Aug-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Pyrgos


[07-Aug-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	On the plus side I dont have to worry about NCC / ICA conversions, The Huber CX is NCC


[07-Aug-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	one of the top fertile planets with good water and 3days round trip to MOR


[07-Aug-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	pretty much on par with saladin really


[07-Aug-23 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	That is interesting. Was waiting on a spot on Katoa to open but thats taking forever


[07-Aug-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	If you just want wertile and haul in water, Danakil would work


[07-Aug-23 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Montem is also fertile


[07-Aug-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	i see your on Montem already lol


[07-Aug-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Uponor


[07-Aug-23 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Yeah thats was a FLX base but now its all over the place. PE, PG, NS


[07-Aug-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Danakil is Bfab, Lfab, with a couple WPL for COT/NL, WEL for HYF/TRU and BMP for a bunch of misc stuff. I try to buy as little off the cx as i can


[07-Aug-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	The only thing I cant make is KOM and with my OCD its annoying


[07-Aug-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	didn't notice you were on danakil lol


[07-Aug-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	was just thinking about doing a HYF base for RAT, and looked at a planet and noticd that its a split vote and that with a full HYF base i could outvote the splits and make the COGC ag lol


[07-Aug-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	haha that would be amusing


[07-Aug-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	what planet?


[07-Aug-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	it'd be dirty, but yes snipe in the vote at the last second and poof AG


[07-Aug-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	XG-430b


[07-Aug-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I still get grief over naming QJ-650c


[07-Aug-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	was looking at it as XG-430c is COGC FP, and the plit is Fuel and FP on 430c both with ~900 votes a full hyf setup is 1300 votes


[07-Aug-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Elon lol


[07-Aug-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zean**:	back


[07-Aug-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Welcome back


[07-Aug-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	ty!


[07-Aug-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	They wanted Midas so bad but they had mmmmm like 3 or 4 naming contests and no one would pull the trigger. At the time he was the richest guy in the world and it fit the games backstory about Mars


[07-Aug-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Interesting, almost a punishment for indecisiveness then


[07-Aug-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	I thought it tied in nicely to a planet that makes Gold


[07-Aug-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	or maybe more so inaction


[07-Aug-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	exactly


[07-Aug-23 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I'd much rather say im on Elon, then Planet mc planetface.....

[07-Aug-23 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	@Zean you got mail. i checked the cont and i did miss it. sorry about that. if you need more just let me know


[07-Aug-23 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	thank you!


[07-Aug-23 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	may i ask


[07-Aug-23 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	whats is the requirement to join GTU and what are the perks from a game mechanic stand point?


[07-Aug-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Discord and be active basically


[07-Aug-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	sounds easy to me! val im going to dm you something rq.


[07-Aug-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	It really depends on what you want to do ingame. Some of the production lines and chains are quite long and involved. Some perks are reduced prices on ships and upgrades, some access to additional starter grans and loans. But mostly its just a big group of active players who are good peoples

[07-Aug-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Ship builidng can always use more help if that is of interest.


[07-Aug-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zean**:	im sure if find a place to be a friendly cog into space ship production!

**Zean**:	id*


[07-Aug-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	Corps give a 10% boost to base production on the HQ planet, so Kinza for GTU


[07-Aug-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Lots of simpler jobs or far complex so thats up to you.


[07-Aug-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	People complain about it taking 2 months or more to order a ship and receive it but they have no frikkin clue how involved it is. Money isnt the issue, throwing hunderds of millions of credits wont solve the problem or it would already be solved. As large and active as GTU is, we are always looking for more active players who enjoy this type of game


[07-Aug-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Aug-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kleptomedia**:	Lucrative shipping offers up for VER -> Midway c


[09-Aug-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	What's making you move if you don't mind me asking? Like what industry is Midway so attractive for


[09-Aug-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Midway C is a dedicated Food Industry planet. Green planet area is premium, so having both farms and food industry on Verdant means you save on logistics, but sacrifice specialization efficiency and also build Food Plants onto soil you could use for farming instead.


[09-Aug-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	If you just want to make a couple RATs, just having it all done on Verdant is probably good enough. But if you want to mass-produce RATs and higher tier consumables, you probably want Verdant exclusively reserved for agricultural buildings.


[09-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	Ah ok. And I guess Midway C is the closest planet in the direction of MOR thats easy to build on?


[09-Aug-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	the low pressure threw me off


[09-Aug-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	dedicated FP planet is natural progression for the career Victualler.  Midway is current best option, even with the low pressure.  It adds 20-30% to the construction costs


[09-Aug-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	Makes sense.


[09-Aug-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	I hand't considered that its just a place to put things. It felt like there had to be something in the (kinda lackluster) resources I was missing haha


[09-Aug-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	but with fertility at a premium that makes sense


[09-Aug-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	in hindsight I probably could have checked the CoGC there haha


[09-Aug-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed, i run FRM on Verdant and Pyrgos(soon) to feed into Midway C for FIM production.


[09-Aug-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	To be fair, the most efficient setup would be a green planet, a random Food Industry planet, and a shipyard all in the same system. Because that way you can null the agri logistics with a cheap STL-only ship.


[09-Aug-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But Moria region doesn't have such a setup, so Midway is the best effort.


[09-Aug-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	Right, all the other planets in the Verdant system are not great for building on


[09-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	More relevantly, they're all really far from Verdant, except for a, which is horribly to build on :P


[09-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	let alone MOR yea


[09-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paint_Bucket**:	yea


[09-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"All in the same system" - sure?  Sometimes its faster to FTL jump than STL go between planets.


[09-Aug-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've been able to shave hours off a midway - midway run by jumping out and back in.


[09-Aug-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The main advantage of in-system is that an STL only ship is a lot cheaper than an FTL capable one, and also the jump trick does require more monitoring to line up.


[09-Aug-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Would that require a shipyard in system too?


[09-Aug-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	And for some systems, like QQ-001, the jump between planet can be as low as 30 minutes when they're line up perfectly.


[09-Aug-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yep, thats what Alblake was saying before, and SHY are pretty easy to build at this point in the game if the situation works


[09-Aug-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(long ago, on the mac there was a game called 'orbital traders' I think which was about lining up planets and trades to minimize travel time since the game was time limited)

**SomeKnight**:	I'm kind of working out the math on doing a 4 base operation in system.


[16-Aug-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	only issue is that because 2 of the other planets in system aren't set up, that cost would fall on me...


[16-Aug-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Heh


[16-Aug-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Evolivolution**:	Yeah I saw the 2 days/week. Just wanted to make sure :)


[22-Aug-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ghads, Ask of 247 and Bid of 154 on VEG.NC1 - that's quite a spread.


[22-Aug-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	50x BEA and 50x VEG at 200/unit (10k total) on LM.  Immediate delivery for the next... oh, hour.


[23-Aug-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	do we need to designate someone to clear the minefield and accept every LM contract?


[23-Aug-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	annoying how blocking them doesn't hide the LM posts


[23-Aug-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	Ima just ruin your rating if you do that


[23-Aug-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	this is piracy


[23-Aug-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got to fufill one half of the contract to have it be a violation.


[23-Aug-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	and i plan on that


[23-Aug-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	you dont deliver i pay and ur rating go down, you deliver and i steal your stuff


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	oh man even me saying this people still are accepting ads


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	beautiful


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got 20 days to pay up.


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	ight i got 20 days of youtube videos ready


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then I've got a day grace period to deliver.


[23-Aug-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	>:) ight


[23-Aug-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	let me test my piracy tactics


[23-Aug-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm waiting for the 180k NCC for you to try it out.


[23-Aug-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	you aint getting 180k


[23-Aug-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Then you can't hold me in violation on the contracts until you fulfill part of it.


[23-Aug-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	we will see

[23-Aug-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The contract timer will run out and it will dissapear.


[23-Aug-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elon-Musk**:	alright


[23-Aug-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**p_rplerain**:	@shagie imagine being salty for somebody wanting to pay you money for products, or ya know, playing the game as it's meant to


[23-Aug-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Alright, I've got 10 of his contracts.  With another few people accepting his ads and letting them expire, he won't be able to accept any more contracts.


[23-Aug-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**p_rplerain**:	Interesting, cuz I like money. When I fulfill my side he does his. Again, almost like that's how it's supposed to work


[23-Aug-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's a maximum limit to the number of open contracts a person can have.  I'm well below that... but once he hits it, he won't be able to do any more damage.


[23-Aug-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	You mean you'll pay me to lose rating?


[23-Aug-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	I'm on mobile right now so it'll be too much of a pain


[23-Aug-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm hoping for a 600k payout.


[23-Aug-23 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Right, so the plan is to just accept his contract spam with multiples of us, and just let the contracts expire?


[23-Aug-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Does that mess with our rating at all?


[23-Aug-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Only if he actually pays up. The exception to this is if you take a shipping contract and he gives you the goods, then you're obligated to actually try and deliver.


[23-Aug-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But honestly if he pays up, worth the rep loss.


[23-Aug-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm just going to keep him, and anyone who supports him blocked and muted. Trolls get bored eventually, and soon enough the rest of the game isn't willing to trade or do anything with them.


[23-Aug-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Is there a reason ads are free here?


[23-Aug-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Ask the Governor.


[23-Aug-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Or maybe not, idk who sets the LM rates.


[23-Aug-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I saw it as a good thing till I found out easy it was to abuse.


[23-Aug-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Most people won't abuse it, he's the exception.


[23-Aug-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I've been asking the devs if it's possible to make it so that a blocked user won't show up in the LM feed either.


[23-Aug-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	That would be an easy solution.


[23-Aug-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If he pays the 60k on the buy ad he posted, I'll happily give him 200 rat.


[23-Aug-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and not take the rep hit)


[23-Aug-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	lol


[23-Aug-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The free ads in normal times make it a place where people would prefer to do the contracts on the MOR-VER run.


[23-Aug-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It makes MOR-Verdant or Midway-Verdant hub'ed out of Verdant which increases the traffic and growth here for production.


[23-Aug-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The occasional "buying FE" that you see are because its easier to ship from further out to here, pick up some RAT and sell your FE and go back.


[23-Aug-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And in that sense, verdant is the gateway to the non-faction space in the north-east... in part because ads are free to place.


[23-Aug-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Interesting.


[23-Aug-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Why spend another day (or two) each way to get to Moria if you don't need to?


[23-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Well I may be new to this game but I am enjoying it.


[23-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Are they always working on it, how often are updates?


[23-Aug-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Major updates are usually on a quarterly / bi-yearly basis. It depends on how much work is needed to implement said features and so on. Otherwise the devs are always looking to do minor tweeks here and there, with good feedback.


[23-Aug-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	So I saw there was a stock market update, how do you do that?


[23-Aug-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Dunno, haven't messed around with it.


[23-Aug-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'd ask in the discord, or global chat.


[23-Aug-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Scale up production to the point where you're producing more than you're using.  Look also at 'cash crops' - GRN.NC1 and RCO.NC1 sell well.


[30-Aug-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you can find some DDT.NC1 for not too much (price a bit crazy right now), you can use that to grow HER.NC1 and from that you can make FIM.NC1


[30-Aug-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	4k?! that's even more crazy.


[30-Aug-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As you look at "hmm... another base?" Look at the Chamber of Global Commerce.  Verdant is Agri - the FRMs get a bonus - but not the FPs.  Midway c is often the choice for expanding for FP.


[30-Aug-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	DDT.NC1 grows 4 HER.NC1 so you turn 4000 into 8000


[30-Aug-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep, but that DDT is still a bit of sticker shock when you buy it.  I bought my batch back when it was about 1000 (I think).


[30-Aug-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(checking - nope, 2000)


[30-Aug-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(still slowly plugging away at my stash of herbs... now 31)

**Sev_Sorokin**:	so i ran out of drinking water, how do i purchase more?


[30-Aug-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Being a person on Verdant, put some DW into your food processor queue.


[30-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	oh right ty


[30-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Cancel orders to get it to the top of the queue.


[30-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(queue orders - not "making RAT right now" orders)


[30-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider alternating between RAT and DW.


[30-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	yes i see, thank you, making a batch of 40 RATs


[30-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	alright makes sense


[30-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	How many Farms do you have?


[30-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	only 1, i have only built with the initial materials


[30-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(just talking it through here)... so for BEA / VEG / GRN, you do 1 GRN (the low water one) and that's about 9h.   Then 2 orders of low water BEA for another 4 units. And then VEG for 8h.


[30-Aug-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's about 26h to make 4 units of the good for RAT... which is also a bit more than the time it takes to make 4x RAT (for 40 units total).


[30-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But you can put an H2O to DW order (10 H2O for 7 DW) that will take 3h... and you'll be about even for the ratios there.


[30-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That all make sense?


[30-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	alright i see, how i just grow those goods in the farm on repeat, and alternate between DW and RAT in the FD?


[30-Aug-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	so i just grow*


[30-Aug-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  The ratios and times change based on what you pick.


[30-Aug-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you go with NUT instead of VEG, its a 25h production cycle but produces 12 NUT for 1 H2O - the best one if you're running a low water situation.


[30-Aug-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So you'd do NUT GRN BEA GRN BEA GRN BEA and that would produce 12 of each... and I'd have to do the time for the math on that again.


[30-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's about a 1:1 ratio (and very hand wavy about) for farms to food processors.


[30-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But make sure that you don't forget the RIGs to keep the water flowing.


[30-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you want to go faster, there are faster versions of GRN, BEA, and VEG that consume more water.


[30-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and consuming more water means you'll need more rigs which means you need more workers who then eat more... but you make more...)


[30-Aug-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	yeah i see its exponential, how do i go about buying more material to build rigs?


[30-Aug-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Send a ship over to Moria and then send it back.  Don't spend too much fuel making it go fast (that can get expensive)


[30-Aug-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Keep an eye on faction contracts that you can piggy back sending some of your surplus on the ship with it.


[30-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sev_Sorokin**:	alright nice, i have a ship headed to Moria right now, thanks for the tips


[30-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll find things like "Provsion shipment at Verdant; pick up at verdant; deliver at Moria; payment of 2053 NCC; Pick up 308 STL at Verdant"

**SomeKnight**:	I'm aware.


[30-Aug-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Issue is if I do that, then my MAI isn't - to my BEA and NUT


[30-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I do have 8x DDT.NC1 here


[30-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can have one of them for 2500


[30-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You want me to turn them into HER for you?


[30-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well it does make profit


[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Payment will be deferred to tomorrow if you don't mind, that's when my ship makes it to market.


[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can defer payment by 96 days, effectively making this a negative interest loan


[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which it is already since you can just sell back to CX


[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	What if DDT goes down in price and completely crashes?


[30-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SomeKnight**:	I know


[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have experience with the CL.NC1 supply chain


[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	May I ask why you only sold 1 instead of all 8?


[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll make that 2


[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah thought you hit the jackpot lol XD


[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Blacksail**:	some planets are good for one industry, others not so much


[01-Sep-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	But each building is in a category like Construction (for prefabs) metulargy, resource extraction. once you start producing over time experts show up that make your building more efficient


[01-Sep-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	And each planet with a Chamber of Global Commerce (COGC) will have a 25% production bonus on one specific category

[01-Sep-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	for your first two bases.. just build what you need te get going and to get cashflowing. After that there is time to build out each base wit buildings of the COGC category


[01-Sep-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Verdant gogc is going for agri, i dont think thats going to change. I'm on rig+col+frm+fp loop atm, selling excess RAT/DW/O and importing lux I need, few DDT for the FIM and prefabs for expansion. I was thinking even without GOCG, experts or any other bonus if its worth it to make a prefab1 plant to help cut away expansion costs


[01-Sep-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Or if i just ride the bonuses, make profit and pay the marketprice for prefab


[01-Sep-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	My market ship is coming back empty so it might be good to have it haul something useful like the prefab mats?


[01-Sep-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	I just put 6000 MCG on LM (in batches of 500) for 22/u. Don't haul your MCG all the way from MOR! #BuyLocal


[01-Sep-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	yes sure you can put PP1 on verdant if it is your first base. and your current setup is fine. Firstbase is always a bit of a mixed mess..


[01-Sep-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's what I did :D


[01-Sep-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	later when yoy need more RAT and DW or other consumables you could built a FP base to limit Verdant tot RIG and FRM (for example) so as you grow you also rework existing bases to fit needs or specialize them for extra profit of COGC


[01-Sep-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	haven't changed verdant at all since I started off


[01-Sep-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Moona**:	What are some of the things people need at Verdant?


[01-Sep-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Thought I might as well use the free space coming here for something...


[01-Sep-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	DDT.NC1


[01-Sep-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're hauling into Verdant, you could sell DDT, though that's got a 450 NCC spread.  You might be able to sell 10 at up to 4000 / unit, but if you're buying at at 3750 that's not much profit per unit and a lot of investment.


[01-Sep-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You could sell OVE at 95 to 100 NCC per unit.  Lower margin there though, but also lower investment costs.


[01-Sep-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PWO.NC1 would be another thing to bring in and sell in reasonably small lots.  Might be able to sell those at up to 300 / unit with a lot size of 20 to 30.


[01-Sep-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With many of these, if you're buying at the current ask price, it's going to be difficult to haul and list with much profit.


[01-Sep-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If I get regular shipments I can just put low buy oders.


[01-Sep-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	generally, people only buy above the ASK if it is an emergency


[01-Sep-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dyson**:	Collectors for O? 10


[02-Sep-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	10 pretty much suffocated Verdant, Vallis, and the CX to the point I tore them down after I had over 4,000 stockpiled. You can fit 10 COL and 20 RIG if you want to focus on Resource Extraction until you get your 5 experts. .


[02-Sep-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	You can sell your H2O for 35/u all day long. Once you have Verdant full you can open a base on Midway C and turn all your water in DW and sell for 70/u all day long


[02-Sep-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyson**:	Then once you have your 5 extraction experts and you are sitting on enough O you are tired of looking at it tear them dowm down and convert them to HYF. Those can turn out a ton of Ag products quickly. You do not even have to turn them into anything like RAT, the MOR CX is always short on Ag products and currently you can get between 250-300/u for pretty much anything, 800+/u for RCO


[02-Sep-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Toss in a new order window at Verdant for your farm and your food processor.


[02-Sep-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Under 'efficiency factors' you'll see a 'CoGC program' on the farm that gives you a 25% boost.


[02-Sep-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Wouldn't it be nice to have that over on the food processor too? Instead of building 5 FPs you'd only need 4 to get the same production... and that also means you'd need 40 fewer pioneers too (and less rat, dw, and ove... and pwo and cof).

Picked up one that was a bit more m3 (but less tonnage) than I had properly provisioned for the Verdant to Moria run... had to do a reroute for a different ship plan to make sure I got the shipment on time (its gonna be close)

[02-Sep-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's also heading out to YI-705c which is a chem world with HAL that can be used to make DDT.NC1 (and uses the C and H2O from Bastion)

[04-Sep-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	For planets with no fertile soil.


[05-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It just seems like such a pain in the but to keep up maintenance wise. H2O


[05-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	No or bad fertile soil.


[05-Sep-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So it looks like VEG MUS and MAI slightly beat out in cost efficency for RATs.


[05-Sep-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But honestly it feels like the only real reason is the throughput of area -> Agri + Cof.


[05-Sep-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Obviously you still need to keep some farms for herbs.


[05-Sep-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	HCP is also better in HYfs..


[05-Sep-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Hrmh.


[05-Sep-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Gosh dang a full HYF base is such a H2O pit


[05-Sep-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	And it's sad because Verdant is also the best planet nearby to extract water from >_>


[05-Sep-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@SomeKnight HYF = higher throughput for RAT production. For example, ALG production is insane, VEG also insane (though eats a lot of H2O)


[05-Sep-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Also, 2xHYF fits in same area a single FRM


[05-Sep-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	So, converting FRM to HYF means more FP, which means more profit in the end. But yes, you need to supply lots of H2O and NS


[05-Sep-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Plus as mentioned earlier, HYF ignores fertility, so you can build them on Midway/c, for example


[05-Sep-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Even crops which appear to "lose" money according to PRUNplanner make that profit back by converting to RAT


[05-Sep-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Sep-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Turin**:	Seeing alot of Shipping Contracts from Verdant b to Midway c, assuming it's ag, but then nothing posting on the local Midway c market.


[06-Sep-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Is there another step in the chain? Surprised there's no shipping requets from Midway c on to Moria or other destinations.


[06-Sep-23 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	midway C is a food processing planet. many mid to late game players will have verdant and other planets produce crops which are moved to midway C to be turned into rations and other consumables


[06-Sep-23 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Ok, thank you!


[06-Sep-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yw


[06-Sep-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The Chamber of Global Commerce (CoGC) for Verdant you see when you do a new order and gives a 25% bonus to farms.  Midway C has a food processor bonus.  What takes 5 FPs where only takes 4 FPs there.  That means less consumables and repairs... and you can do more with 500 area for a base.


[06-Sep-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Also, there is more tons to be shipped VER-MID (raw goods) than MID-MOR (finished goods).


[06-Sep-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I need to export close to 100t/day from Verdant, but only 50t/day from Midway


[06-Sep-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	So it's a good place to get free shipping if you're not into food processing or are low on shipping capacity :)


[06-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It can be cheaper to sell agri on the LM at a fair price than shipping them to the CX where someone else buys it and then ships it to midway.


[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	I really appreciate the insights. I'm just starting out as a C Farmer, been making a little revenue on my runs to CX by shipping for others.


[06-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	question whats your rate for carbon?


[06-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
***DarkKing** deleted this message.*


[06-Sep-23 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	can only take 222 units per 500 ship.


[06-Sep-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	What do you mean by rate? You mean rate to transport it?


[06-Sep-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	what do you sell carbon for. in other words its price


[06-Sep-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Oh! I've been selling it just below lowest offer to turn it around quickly, so I can re-invest in scaling up my operation. I don't plan to do that longterm, but I'm only 6 days in. What's your rate?


[06-Sep-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i dont produce it, i use it to produce PE which i then sell to corp mates or use myself.


[06-Sep-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i buy locally where i can but if push comes to shove i get it from CX, problem is the source i did by from has stopped putting ads up on the local market


[06-Sep-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	I'm very small right now, but it sounds like there is opportunity on the local market. I'd be happy to develop sell local and develop some relationships


[06-Sep-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aye, people have BMPs here which can use the carbon to make PE or safety uniforms. the PE is then moved into PP! and PP2 to produce bfabs or reused to make OVE


[06-Sep-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	pp1*


[06-Sep-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	PPA only has one use, and if you are making MTP, you likely have FP buildings to make your own PPA

**shagie**:	Or the odd faction contract.


[21-Sep-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	true


[21-Sep-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I made it a bit ago when I thought I could get in on selling it since there were a few orders on the books... and let that be a warning to others - don't make it unless you can keep costs down.  Its thinly traded so will sit on the offers for weeks before someone needs some.

**Kuben**:	Good morning greenies! I would just like to say this will be last term serving as governor of Verdant. It's been an honor, and honestly what has kept me active over the last year. I will continue to play and might take up a gov post on another planet in the future, but I feel it's time to allow another to harvest the joy of governing you bunch of rascals. I will finish upgrading the wildlife park, and stock up the upkeep before my departure and leave 1m NCC for the next governor. You're all aces in my book (except Elon)! I'm sorry I couldn't get rid of the bugs, but honestly they feel a part of me at this point. Actually some might be.. - oh god no! they're comming! *bzzzzz*

[23-Sep-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	All jokes aside, I'm not really sure there's anything else left to really do on Verdant, it's got all of the building levels it truly needs. Unless we're seriously wanting to get engineers and scientists on the world for some reason.


[23-Sep-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It'


[23-Sep-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Sep-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm aware that they want to make these things happen. But they've also been wanting to make these things happen for years. :) If it's in the next update then I'll be estatic, but my money's on... well Pr:Un first of all, and probably not anytime soon,


[24-Sep-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Thanks for the kind words! :) For the two candidates I agree, there is not really any infrastructure needed. Maybe continue upgrading the Warehouse. The current tax level provides about 400k a week. And the cx price for the upkeep (without ART) is over 1,1m a week. I produce the upkeep goods which has allowed me to have such a low tax level. I urge you to play arround with the POPI calculator, because I think there is much room for optimizing the building levels and wheras also tax. So I want to hear your taxplan in time for the next election @SomeKnight @Not_Trey :)


[24-Sep-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	400k 1 way, or 400k splut between all faction members? Because AFAIK taxes go to the corp, and are divvied up from there. Because if I have to spend my own money to upkeep the planet, then the simple answer is that taxes are going up depending on how much my deficit is. Otherwise I'm happy to keep it as low as possible.


[24-Sep-23 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	Split between faction members. But it's normal for a new gov to set up a new corp to handle taxes. I have a corp with two friends, so we just have a weekly contract set up.


[24-Sep-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Taxes going up 200%?


[24-Sep-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	if its 400k income and 1.1m upkeep?


[24-Sep-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I plan on not raising taxes at all, I want to make it as smooth of a transition from Kuben as possible. I plan on shifting my base on verdant to produce the required upkeep. If needed I will leave my Corp, to handle the upkeep costs. I may add a fee to the warehouse but I will keep the local market free to stimulate local trade.


[24-Sep-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	@SomeKnight s plan of increasing taxes to cover the difference is inefficient and he will import resources not made on Verdant. I plan on keeping Verdant as self sufficient as possible with a majority of our Upkeep coming from local suppliers or myself. The money will be spent on Verdant to keep our beautiful green planet rich.


[24-Sep-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Sounds good :)


[24-Sep-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	If you can do that go for it. But you literally have 2 bases, you're not much better off then me base wise. How are you going to supply all of the things that @Kuben has been doing?


[24-Sep-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You're making promises you can't keep, and if the difference in taxes compared to expenses is 700k, I don't know how you're going to not hemmorage income.


[24-Sep-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	POPID p-YI-715b t-PAR and POPID p-YI-715b t-SST show some signficant material contribution.


[24-Sep-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Im building tall on verdant, Im still crunching some of the numbers but I do believe I can get away with low taxes.


[24-Sep-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You're just going to buy all of the raw resources to produce everything you want to upkeep?


[24-Sep-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Because the DW and other workforce consumables is the easy part of funding the POPI / COCG.


[24-Sep-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Most of the resources can be made on verdant, some things that need to be mined like mg and others im looking at the possibility of making bases for those.


[24-Sep-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	MG, SIO, AL, HAL ETC

[24-Sep-23 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	currently 5 farms and 4 food processors but i am investing in making that 15 farms and 7 fps, still working on the plan and efficiency but the estimates i have currently appear to be very doable.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	simple questions have simple answers :D


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but solving IRL issues is more important than this


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	yes agreeed


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Okay here's a better question. Are you able to do this without having to essentially subsidize everyone else on planet, and turn a 'profit' on taxes?


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Because I think it's rediculious to expect a Governor to do that, on anything less then a project planet.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Im not looking for a profit quite honestly I want to maintain the Golden Age Kuben has brought us.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm personally not willing to take a loss to keep this planet at absolute minimum taxes. So you're the one to go for if that's the case.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I don't have the numbers, but even shifting the local rules up a tiny bit would be all that's really nessessary.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Unemployment is very high currently, there is a lot of ways to improve efficiency on this planet while keeping taxes low.


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Raising Taxes is not the answer to maintaining Verdant


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	What POPI are you planning on not using / minimizing  upkeep?


[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Midway c (wb-675-c) politics is an interesting insight into governship.


[24-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But my point still stands, what are we willing to abandon / lower the upkeep on to not hemmorage income as Governor whike maintaining a good unemployment rate.


[24-Sep-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	We can lower the upkeep on the INF PAR to keep upkeep costs low, unemployment is too high right now I want to get it to about 15%


[24-Sep-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Perhaps the youtube wave will boom and take care of that


[24-Sep-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I've put a bit of MAI into my queue that I can help people doing FP with... but I don't have the local FP to make FOD here in quantity (nor the goods on Midway to make it there)


[25-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I've got 11 FP and more being built once my ship gets back, so I can produce locally, I just don't have enough FRMs to feed a full fod run.


[25-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	If I do a full swing now without any further planning, I'll have a shortfall of NUT and MAI by 40 units, and that's not at 100% FOD production


[25-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	100% is closer to 71 NUT / MAI and 28 VEG.


[25-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So if anyone only has AGRI here, and wants to help split the burden, I can dedicate my FP for a few days at 100% capacity to hammer out 2k fod.

**SomeKnight**:	You're typically better off looking for ALO and LST together if such planets exist. Just because of how much more versatile AL is compared to FL./

[28-Sep-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	How many you need someknight?


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	35 NUT VEG and 67 MAI daily is my current need. Assuming of course I only use 50% capacity


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	And I'


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm only doing this for like 5 days


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	SO TL:DR If you have 500 or so of MAI NUT VEG stockpiled and are willing to sell on planet, that would more or less suit my needs, else I can pay for production runs.


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Noob question, there's about 300 MAI on the local market, price is above Moria, although you save shipping costs. Cheaper to just cover production runs?


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Waiting on payment / contracts to go through, so a lot of this is deferred past the 3 day limit, otherwise it wouldn't be such a terrible offer.


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	if you are already making trips to the CX, you should buy at the CX.  I'd only pay above CX iif I needed it in a hurry


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	I've only been buying at CX, but have made temporary sale offers to support LM.


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	I have bought locally in a pinch


[28-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Either way, send me your production rates, and if we can get me to ~ 100% capacity, I should be able to pay everyone for their AGRI ~ at the start of next week.

[30-Sep-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Foefighter**:	Keep verdant independent!


[12-Oct-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's nothing agri to do beyond orchards (technician staffed).  Trying to support buildings that are eng or sci staffed would imply either raising the costs for the rest of us on Verdant, or getting the "I want to build an engineering production building" to fully fund it themselves.


[12-Oct-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	To put something into context, although it's not as important now, as when the game was pushing 600+ people daily.


[12-Oct-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	There's only like 10 or so actual good fertile planets in the entire galaxy map.


[12-Oct-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So in Theory, it is entirely possible to run out of fertile space to farm for HER and ORC supplies.


[12-Oct-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	HYF aside, it's a major factor in why you'd want to coax / force people to not do anything besides farming on said planets. Ghost plots on starters aside.

**DavikCo**:	what the markets need :D


[13-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're probably making RAT... might be doing C, but that has a much simpler answer "GRN first".


[13-Oct-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're also limited to the BEA / VEG / NUT / MAI / GRN set (MUS and ALG are from hydroponic farms)


[13-Oct-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The most common two are BEA / VEG / GRN and BEA / NUT / GRN.


[13-Oct-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	VEG has the advantage that it grows faster but its also more water hungry than NUT (You need 9 H2O for 12 VEG, but only 1 H2O for 12 NUT)


[13-Oct-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	MAI rather than GRN costs 3 more water.  But its probably easier to sell to C farmers because they do GRN first.


[13-Oct-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For cash crops, HCP and RCO shouldn't be ignored if you have surplus capacity - but make sure you can't sell something else for more.


[13-Oct-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	btw, BastionCorporation - in your expansion plans, given that you're up in Verdant currently, it would be remiss of you not to expand into Bastion system at some point.

**Not_Trey**:	Alright I will keep that in mind


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parkilla**:	And I'm not sure, but charge 1k a week for them.  Would bring in 500K/wk for other verdant upgrades


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I do not like that idea, a great part of verdant is the LM and Warehouses are free, I would have to hear from others to see what they think, and I think taxes will be enough to cover upkeep and upgrades.


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parkilla**:	yeah it's true, it's a nice perk.  LM I think should be free to encourage trading, but lets say you had to pay 7K a week to support 7 warehouses, you're not going to even notice it.  resulting 2.25M/mo would buy add'l warehouses and upgrades, but not really sure what's next besides those


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parkilla**:	LM fees would hurt new players and discourage trading.


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Maybe, I could lower taxes and all the money to upkeep Verdant comes from warehouses, I would have to do the math and hear from others.


[14-Oct-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Just so you and everyone else knows, I will most likely be using the UFO Verdant channel a lot more, and if you ever need me you can also send me a DM.

[14-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You'll have to buy pro / supporter tier / get gifted a pro in order to use the LM feature. After you pay for anything at all, you'll turn into a Basic user after your pro runs out, instead of a 'free' user. Which lets you keep doing contracts.


[14-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I got some extra Pro codes if you want one.


[14-Oct-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	That goes for all new players, if you want a pro code I got 2 and they are first come first serve, send me a pm if you want one.


[14-Oct-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I personally reserve my codes for people who actually look like they're going to stay. Just giving them out to any day 1 seems silly.

**Not_Trey**:	Good afternoon Verdant,  I am your new governor, Trey. I would like to thank everyone who voted for me and Kuben for helping out with this transition. This term, I intend to run Verdant more efficiently, hopefully getting the planet to a point where its current taxes can support it. Every Saturday at around 1 p.m. EST, I will try to publish an update on taxes, unemployment, changes in population, and future projects. They will be posted in the UFO verdant-politics channel. I will be publishing the spreadsheet I am using for calculating the upkeep, taxes, and active POPI level here also, so if you are ever curious, you can see what I am planning on doing. All concerns or questions should be asked in the politics channel for transparency sake, unless you prefer the conversation to be private. Feel free to @ or DM me whenever. Once again, I would like to thank Kuben and everyone who voted for me.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qZXbjnj8M6Uzc0vECj9ZVQUH8FAeNz1zsPI-CZDv36w/edit?usp

[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If GTU were to offer extending financing, you'd still have the ship paid for before they get done building it.


[24-Oct-23 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's not a fair statement after we've rejigged the production lines.


[24-Oct-23 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Would it be feasible to do "This is what I want" (you make it), Get a loan for difference in what is on hand and costs, pay loan amt + rest, pay off loan over time?


[24-Oct-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The shipbuilding effort is setup as a more-or-less loosely organized group of component builders. When you place an order, the you'll begin getting contracts from those builders as the items become available. This means we don't sell the ship in a single lump sum payment. We may implement that some day, though, but it adds another layer of complexity.


[24-Oct-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	In the last month we've completed a total of 36 chip orders and upgrades of various types, including a few with advanced components. The most popular ship we've sold in that time has been the "Standard Large Transport" which accounts for roughly half the orders.


[24-Oct-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laserbees**:	and on that note, if the contract can't be completes because you can't deliver, you still get penalized for it. I had this happen and got knocked down to a B rating.

**Not_Trey**:	Just a quick question for everyone but how would you all feel if we banned tech eng and sci from the planet if it meant we could have almost 0 taxes?


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Purely hypothetical currently but its an idea I have been thinking of


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	less than 1% of the population is Tech/Eng/Sci.  Why would you need to ban them?  (and how?)


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its because of how satisfaction works, the lowest percentage of health or safety is the max percentage comfort can get. To have enough comfort to prevent the tech pop from declining I have to spend 226K weekly on just health and safety and another 205k on comfort just for that 1%


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its highly inefficient I do not mind keeping it the way it is tho I just though I would get your opinion on this


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	So basically no IVP, and suboptimal ORC efficiency is the only effect for Agri?


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Very good points but yes. The thing I have not calculated yet is Education In for technicians


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Because education in might be higher than migration out so then no effect on agri I just have to figure that out


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I mean, I'm probably a ways off from needing techs so it won't affect me much; I am still learning the ropes.  Seems like there is a lot to balance.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	128 out at 34% happiness and 1k pop and 117.3 in with education


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that IVP is a food industry (not agri), so there's no bonus for having it here.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Oh. That's even better then.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	If we had a level 10 uni with 0 upkeep it provides a .01 boost to education so that 117.3 in becomes 195.5 adjusted with the new numbers


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Orchard is 70 settlers and 10 techs.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	so basically 85% efficiency without techs


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its possible to keep technicians positive while having their satisfaction and migration low


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(btw, Proxion UV-796b runs for high tier workers - they've got half as many PIO as Verdant, and 3x more Techs (and engineers... and for some reason, even scientists)


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its because of education it looks like


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  It's curious over there... but they're using them.  Partly because the place isn't quite as viable for agri as here.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(a rig produces an ever so impressive 2 H2O / cycle)


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I really think we should lean into that agri more, makes it more efficient to farm, less money spent on taxes.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	1% of the pop accounts for 50% of upkeep


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	my RIG gets 8 H2O every 5 hours


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I only run pioneers, so the change would not affect me


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PIO only here too.  Fertile land for FRMs are too important to use the area for other things.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Hmm I may hold some sort of meeting over discord to discuss this with more people because this would be a large change.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	So HYP doesn't get affected by fertility?  Didn't catch that before... Basically just the CoGC and Experts?


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There are about 10k SET employed in places (I suspect ORC) and 590 Techs.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Correct.  HYFs can be built anywhere.


[26-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Bastion c appears to be in the process of developing a HYF world)


[26-Oct-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant with HYFs has the advantage of easy building requirements, CoGC, plentiful water, and 3rd party logistics.  HYFs can grow certain crops faster than FRMs (so if you're after capacity of agri it can be better)


[26-Oct-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If a different world has access to water, CoGC and not too bad for logistics and building requirements, it may be a better choice than Verdant for HYFs.


[26-Oct-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Wow that is a lot of water needed.


[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright I have figured it out after talking to a few other governors more expirenced than me and I can turn the par off.


[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Oct-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**intti**:	so lads cos just begin, should i consentrate on one agrl product ? running out of cash and rations. no  agri but making water and carbon, ppa good enough stuff for my pioners?


[27-Oct-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**intti**:	no alg line yet i mean.


[27-Oct-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**intti**:	this math they demand 8per day, but production of 4 takes 17 hours makes me ponder my survival pct


[27-Oct-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Also note that if you run an ORC without techs, the COGC and fertility bonuses make up for the TEC deficit. Besides, why build a habitation building for just 10 TECs?


[27-Oct-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@intti if you wanted to concentrate on selling a single agri product without processing it further, RCO is a decent crop for that


[27-Oct-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Otherwise, there are a lot of options, but if you produce enough DW and RAT to keep your workers happy, it will save you money and shipping needs, and one or two FP should be enough.


[27-Oct-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Carbon is a good market. I've never considered making PPA for selling at the exchange. The volume of PPA traded is low, so you might end up not being able to sell much of it.


[27-Oct-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**intti**:	thx, i heard theres demand for carbon, with alg from stock i think can fill basic needs. going to check those crops


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PPA.NC1 by itself is thinly traded.  You can put inventory up there and it won't sell for a month.  So be forewarned about that unless you plan on using it yourself.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	C.NC1 in the slow recipe from GRN - one FRM can support 3x INC.  If you start with the faster burn ones, you can need 6x FRMs to supply 1x INC.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that Resource Extraction doesn't run here - and so its going to be slower (more costly) than on other planets (Frost is the nearby one that fits well).


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The orchard - you're not building for 10 techs, you're building 7x orchards for 70 techs.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RCO.NC1 is an ok cash crop.  There's a fair bit of volume, spread is 10% of total, and has a balanced t/m3 ratio making it easier to haul.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(you can only fit 222 C in a 500 hold, you can fit 500 RCO in a 500 hold only 25t wasted)


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With C and INC on Verdant - while you may get a situation where you're "got 14 space left and 50 PIO free... what to build in the last part of the base?" - you'll generally find that you'd rather have more FRMs and they will push out every last bit of area.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One FRM -> 3x INC... but 3x INC take the same room as 1 FRM and you can probably make more with 2 FRMs than 1 FRM and 3x INC in the long run.


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	7x Orchards? Which market is large enough to support that?


[27-Oct-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	For C production, I would think better results come from growing HCP + MAI in HYF, GRN in FRM, and running triple-recipe INC

[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	As U you can have 5 bases and 2 ships in fly in one time


[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	You can buy lic PRO for 1 month and then you will have lic BASIC, that is similar to PRO, except working with LMs on planets


[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vattaiCS**:	Well, thanks for clarifying for me


[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	some people with A rating are playing with 1-2 bases. Some people with U rating are playing there for 3 years \o/ Everyone finds something special here :)


[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	IIRC, there's a player who makes high end electronics / software on a free license.


[02-Nov-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That’d be Wyper7


[02-Nov-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	wow that's playing in hard mode!


[02-Nov-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I've avoided making the MM electronics because I know that's the short route to becoming bored with the game


[02-Nov-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ship the IDC to market, ship consumables back, rinse and repeat. Yawn.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - its a "it is possible to become one of the weatlier players in the game on a free license" - though that route may not be what everyone enjoys.  For a free player, however, you're always working with the CX and thus having a stable MM buying becomes key to a consistent balance sheet.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I'm definitely going to make EDC/IDC when I can afford to, but until there are more profitable ways to invest with better ROI


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	*until then


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	EDC is the path to burnout imo


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I haven't gone that route as I know it'll take all the fun out of the game for me


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I'll have to try it and see :D


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	As long as I can think of things to spend credits on, doesn't seem like it would do much harm. Besides, Rfabs are not exactly cheap


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Remeber that base upgrades beyond level 5 are also not available to FREE license players - and thus a max of 6 bases.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HQ upgrades rather.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The thing is that the only carrot to chase in the game is money. Once you have a maxed EDC producing base you just feed it consumables and money falls out and that's that. Game over.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You sell to MM and you just buy consumables and that's all the game that's left to you.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's certainly a viable approach but I know that if I touch that - I'll get bored.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - but when the game is limited to the free license limits (2 ships, level 5 HQ, no contracts) - that's the "this is what you can do for endgame content on a free license"


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If growing your wealth isn't limited to those constraints, then other parts of the game become much more intersting.


[02-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Fair enough, I can't imagine playing without pro - I'd lose my mind without repeat orders

**shagie**:	@Leman btw, if you have questions about starting out and what to do, please ask 'em.


[02-Nov-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One trick that I did when I started (because the flight times were so long to Moria) was that I had one ship at Moria and one at Verdant.  Whenever I needed to get something, I'd swap them.  Load up all the stuff I needed to expand in the Moria ship, load up all the surplus to sell in the Verdant ship, and send them to the other spots.


[02-Nov-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This way, instead of a 2d there and 2d back round trip, it would only be 2d to get something (or sell something).

[03-Nov-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	especially since every ship comes here empty


[03-Nov-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Thats a bit of an issue for verdant honestly


[03-Nov-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Everyone at Verdant is self-sufficient, and we don't really need any imports en masse?


[03-Nov-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I mean its a good problem to have but flying empty feels wrong


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parkilla**:	@Zewaka Not really.  It frequently sells here for closer to 1000.  The reality is that I don't actually need to sell it and have it up to be helpful.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parkilla**:	There are a ton of excess goods on Verdant, but notice that few people actually list them.  It's a PITA to manage the goods across all the different LM.  Since I'm only listing it for the convenience of others why should I sell it at or below cost?  I don't even produce it here


[03-Nov-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Agreed. LM trading for "emergency" situations is usually at higher cost than CX


[03-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	996/1000


[03-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... this is gonna change things.  Nearly 100t of HCP/day in the current burn chart.... and that's just HCP.


[03-Nov-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Prun Planner says 286 t / day of export.  ... And 1.58t / day of import.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Sometimes I swear you hate yourself.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Keep in mind, any other planet you'd go to from Verdant is ~ 20+ hours away minimum.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So you'll perpetually be exporting from Verdant. Transport contracts aside lul.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	INCs are hungry.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	We need super incs.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	you can put a few HYF on Frost to ease the logistics burden


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Looking at Bastion - c with some in system shipping for that.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Nice, that works too


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Maybe reserve Verdant just for the GRN component


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The CoGC there is running Agri too.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They still don't have any PIO unemployment there yet though... still 300 jobs to fill.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	One other consideration, if you put (say) 4xHYF on Frost, it would also reduce the need to ship H2O off-planet for Ag. Everything gets a little bit easier, and you are still "mostly" COGC-aligned


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also for Verdant - HER and while HYFs are tempting for some things, it gets challenging to feed it enough water fast enough when you scale up to large amounts.


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	just depends on how many you're talking about


[03-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	3 or 4 is a lot different than 11 or 14


[03-Nov-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	wait i managed to figure it out


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There are two differnet ways to make BEA - you can do 1 H2O and it takes about 4h to make 2 BEA, or 6 H2O and 6h to make 4 BEA.


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	it takes 8h's for me to make 4 beans


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The exact times change based on if you've got lux consumables and experts... I've got both, so that runs faster.


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	i got no lux conssumables


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And saying that now, I do recall 8h -> 4 bea because I did all my initial setup based on "make 12 agri products in 24h"


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you get to Moria, pick up some PWO.NC1 - not a lot - even a few suits will last a while (you'll use 0.2/day or so for a small population)


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COF.NC1 gets used a lot faster and so a harder bit to invest in initially (its still good)


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My initial base setup was 12 BEA in 24h, and 12 GRN in 24h, and 12 NUT in 24h -- and then that would let me make 120 RAT which would take just shy of 3 days (I'd make them in 4(0) sized chunks so they'd be about 1 day each).


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So 40 RAT, 7 DW, 40 RAT, 7 DW, 40 RAT, 7 DW


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that would take slightly longer than 3 days to complete meaning that the next crop of BEA, GRN, and NUT would be available.


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	damn this is longer than long

[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	got a game to put in the background whilst i deal with life then


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Though once you get a few more bases going, there's more things happening... but yea, its a "its there, check in on it every so often and do things."


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	check in on like once or twice a day


[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When playing EVE (long ago) and doing mining, you had to pay some attention to it to make sure that no hostiles showed up - you couldn't just walk away for a day (or even close out the window and play something else for an hour or two).

[09-Nov-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	yeah.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Contracts that PRO license enables allows unrestricted wealth transfer and with free licenses doing "new account, sell all my stuff for 1 NCC, COLIQ" and repeat - that would be too easy to abuse.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	kinda makes sense


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	would be easy materials then


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	well if you ever decide to go pro let me know and I can get you 20 PWO! ;)


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I strongly recommend getting a month of PRO license if you think you'll pay the game for a month or two.  That unlocks a lot of multiplayer interaction.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	i probs won't be able to go PRO till next year


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(It's $8 ...)


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	i don't got a job


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That can lead to some difficulty.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	it will put a damper on progress


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	oh well usually most stuff can be done by bashing your head against it enough times


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I financed my early game by doing shipping contracts (hauling stuff for others).


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, if you pull up a new buffer (or click through Verdant to Local Market) and enter LM YI-715b


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can see the local ads here - someone wants to haul 191t of stuff from here to Midway and will pay 2100 NCC for that.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I create about 300t of stuff per day that goes to Midway too)


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	so not only do you get to ship your stuff for profit but also theirs for profit


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  The going rate tends to be about 10 NCC / ton (or m3 - whichever is greater).


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Gotta remember that not everyone has Pro


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	yea


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So a full load from Verdant to Midway or Moria would run about 5000 NCC.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariane_Lamia**:	noice


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That takes about 200 fuel (FF and SF combined) and for quick math, I use 15 NCC / unit fuel... so 3000 NCC fuel costs, 2000 NCC profit.


[09-Nov-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FF.NC1 and SF.NC1 are actually a bit cheaper, but 15 is easy math.

**ArcturusRex**:	@vattaiCS it's a fun game! Every player has a very different and unique experience. The start is slow, but the game is deceptively complex and deep. Even the slow start can be made "fast" by borrowing capital from other players (which also requires a PRO subscription)


[10-Nov-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Even if you don't go for the borrow route, doing shipping contracts can speed it up and make it quite a bit more interesting while you get a feel for what goods go where.

**shagie**:	Instead of doing "pay 1k NCC to ship 100 O.NC1 and sell it" its "sell it for 16k" its "sell it for 1/2 of its value here and get the money now and don't worry about shipping."


[11-Nov-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I phrased that wrong with a restart mid line.  "Pay 1k to ship 100 to Moria and sell for 16k" vs "sell for 1/2 here and get the money now"

**shagie**:	Even later on - yes.


[13-Nov-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll jiggle the fuel sliders so that the ship docks an hour or two earlier so it gets there while I'm awake (rather than the next day)


[13-Nov-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But if something is due in on a slow setting at 3am, not touching it - not worth that much more to crank it to get in at 10pm instead.


[13-Nov-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's a diminishing returns on the fuel spent.  Spending a lot more fuel only gets there a little sooner.


[13-Nov-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gaby_Destroyer**:	ok thx


[13-Nov-23 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing to do is run some tests with BLU and see how much time savings spending more fuel gains... and balpark the cost of fuel at 15 NCC / unit (SF and FF).

[16-Nov-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Vallis for example (also a starter planet) you will see Available plots listed as 0 / 386 (+96) meaning there are 96 players who started since it filled up.


[16-Nov-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BaxterPierogis**:	what do you mean by "started since it filled up"


[16-Nov-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A new player (or one who COLIQs) can start on any starter world - no matter how full it is.


[16-Nov-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	New players can start on Promitor or Vallis or any other starter world without problem.  However, once there are 0 / ### available plots, no established player can click 'Start Base' on that planet until it goes back to 1 / ###


[16-Nov-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BaxterPierogis**:	i understand that part, i was confused on the 96 players who started since it filled up


[16-Nov-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's the +96 part after the available plots.  That many players will need to leave the planet (mostly likely free accounts who haven't logged in for extended period)


[16-Nov-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BaxterPierogis**:	got ya


[16-Nov-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion (for example) is the agri world of CI... and its at 42 / 391.  It can only hold another 42 players before you wouldn't be able to create a base there.


[16-Nov-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Promitor is 0/422 (+360) ... there's no hope of me _ever_ getting a base there.


[16-Nov-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Montem is currently +61.  Back when it was in the +30 range I know a number of people who had a free permit and the stuff to build a base if it ever went to 1/418 ... I think they've given up since then.


[16-Nov-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Yep. Most of them, anyway. The game verse is running out of low hanging fruit.


[16-Nov-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	If nobody's set up shop on any given planet after three years, then either there's nothing of value or the returns just aren't worth the cost of maintaining a presence. There's no undiscovered treasures out there.


[16-Nov-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	There are only 26 fertile planets, half of them struggle with water, and two-thirds have negative fertility. And with the surge of new players there's no way to get a foot in the door of any fertile starting planet now.


[16-Nov-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	And then there's two fertile planets that remain undeveloped because their location just plain *sucks*: HM-910c is overshadowed by Poseidon in the next system over, and QF-930b is in the ass end of nowhere with nothing good around it to make it worth settling.


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	that means prices will go up


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Promitor is a starter world too.  The best starter worlds are completely filled.  The "not quite as good" (Verdant isn't as good an agri start as Promitor in some respects).  This means that everyone's second base will eventually be on a non-starter world for some industries.


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... (and that is why I put a base on Proxion sooner than later - its water is a minor logistical issue given Etherwind's proximity and that Benten is one hop away.

[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 160 of a 220 offer still up at 660 (and I put it there because someone else had some there that I didn't want to do "ohh, I'll list it at 659 to sell first".


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... but there's someone who listed at 645 now.  I still expect to sell mine in a day or two unless there is a dumping that drives down the price.


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... but there's 12,960 at 675 that will take some time to eat through and another 12,548 at 725.


[16-Nov-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bitbucket**:	I was pondering a base on Pyrgos to make carbon as a first step to eventually expand into mining. Maybe I should grab a plot on Proxion too while I still can   =\


[16-Nov-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Ultimately I'd like to be able to be able to supply all my own food, fuel, and prefabs to cover all my own expansion costs, but that's months down the road.


[16-Nov-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd grab proxion much sooner than later.  Pygros is interesting too (its quite nice if you're ok with the distance to the CX). There's a bit of activity around the CH / KY sectors too if you're going to head that way.


[16-Nov-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And while this is in the "wish" category, if there's a link between FW and CH (there was mention of additional FTL lanes being added in a past dev blog), that would make it _very_ nice to expand to from Verdant.


[16-Nov-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Well, being *here* I'm used to long hauls. Pyrgos to Benten is a similar length of commute.


[16-Nov-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	hm, not a lot of open plots left Proxion, guess you're right about that...y'know what, I've got a ship on standby at Moria, think I'm gonna buy up the prefabs for a minimal base, fly out there, and stake a claim NOW.  D:


[16-Nov-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My initial template in Prun Planner for Proxion was named "placeholder"


[16-Nov-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And seriously, earlier this week it was 110 open plots.  Its now 42.  I got in when it was in the 70s a bit ago...  So its gone up and down a bit, but I wouldn't hold off if you've got the permit and fabs.


[16-Nov-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Circle_of_Life**:	I'm seeing a lot of prime planets losing space, so I'm trying to prioritize expanding holding plots over the next month or two accross the galaxy. I also want an outpost near each of the 4 main exchanges, filling in routes between. I'm also not against outskirt planets that have the fertility, the zones will expand over the next 4-6 months with the recent boom in populations and loss of other opportunity planets

[20-Nov-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If I recall correctly, we had significant unemployment for PIO before.  Costs for CoGC (again, IIRC) are based on population and so we were paying much more for CoGC than was needed.  The way to fix this is to make the PIO tier less happy so they migrate away and get unemployment closer to the 10% level that most planets like to maintain it at.

[22-Nov-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

Once their numbers become manageable it will balance out and the education from those pops will be able to support the technicians. But until then you may have open jobs. I plan on possibly shutting down the SST for a short time because I would like to fix this problem as soon as possible and the quickest way to get the pop to drop is by providing no needs so I will discuss with other governors about this but I will fix this problem as soon as I can. In the mean time I will drop the taxes of Technicians.

[26-Nov-23 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	For the instances where a process turns a large mass into a small one, there's no exotic physics required there, we just call that "wasting most of the materials."

[27-Nov-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Farmers taxes stay the same


[27-Nov-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I am experimenting with non farmers


[27-Nov-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Our taxes are half that of other starter worlds


[27-Nov-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	even with my experimenting the taxes are still 20ncc lower that others


[27-Nov-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Our market is free, our beautiful warehouses are free. Man if verdant isn't a utopia idk what is.

[27-Nov-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	What I think would be funny and great is we over tax everyone but farmers. The whole planetary upkeep is made from those who do not farm and farmers get 0 taxes.


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	dont raise taxes on the other stuff.


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KingBR**:	revolution is also just an idea (jk dont send me to the dungeons))


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	but maybe


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	just maybe we will


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KingBR**:	that would be interesting


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ok so far with my experiment, 58% of tax money comes from just our farmers


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Not_Trey**:	So guess what


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I am not here to help guys


[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	It is now manditory for all households on verdant to have a ronald regan shrine


[27-Nov-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	oh shit


[27-Nov-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Just a thought, the newer players are more likely to have to diversify on Verdant. By keeping farmer taxes low but leaving Food Industry and Extraction higher, you're basically taxing new players at a higher marginal rate


[27-Nov-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	If you want growth on Verdant, you should switch it around the other way


[27-Nov-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	thats really fair it was just an idea of mine but realistically it shouldnt happen


[27-Nov-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	That being said, I'm moving away from single planet diversification, so it'll be better for me if you keep down this route


[27-Nov-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I raised taxes for a temporary experiment. I got that about 50% of all tax money comes just from farmers


[27-Nov-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	we need better tools to figure out the money pie chart


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Were you running systems of linear equations to figure out the relative amounts of each?


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	About


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	very approximate ratios and stuff


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	i only got farmers vs not farmers and i do not have enough updates to figure everything out


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	after the updates go back to 5 i will figure out from pio to settler but i imagine it to be close to the ratio of the working populations


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The biggest reason for insanely low taxes on verdant is the fact scientists and engineers do not live hear so we can get away with minimal upkeep


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	What if each 24 hour period you double exactly one industry?


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	governors only can change taxes 5 times in a term


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	idky


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	I say you max out the tax and increase it to 10000% increase


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Well shit...


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I have 2 left so technically i can do one more experiment


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Only if you aren't running again.


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shaldreth**:	Completely new player, no idea what's going on, but it's nice to see an active governor and I'm enjoying reading the details :)  Feel free to keep experimenting


[27-Nov-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I have 2 more until the next term


[27-Nov-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I really enjoy governing this ball of farmer


[27-Nov-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	farmers*


[27-Nov-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	we're the hub of the food market in nc1 prob


[27-Nov-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	can you imagine if we couldn't provide affordable food for moria!?


[27-Nov-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I think I can technically calculate the exact number of farmsteads we have on verdant


[27-Nov-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	@Not_Trey how would that work?


[27-Nov-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	because farmsteads are the only agricultural building for pios we know the tax is 20ncc per day of production so we get the daily tax number from pios in agricultural and divide that by 20


[27-Nov-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	i forgot hyfs


[27-Nov-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Just complicates the equation i believe


[27-Nov-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Wait the efficiency of a building seems to be used in the tax equation


[27-Nov-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Does anybody actually understand how the tax system works. i do not remember there being taxes on the wiki


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I thought the taxes were days of run time * efficiency?


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	* rate


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	But I haven' t seen mixed use buildings, so I'm not sure how it divides up


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	mixed pop type


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	That equation gets me half of what the taxes actually are


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	about half not exact


[27-Nov-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Im going to figure this out


[28-Nov-23 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	We should have a popi that is a monument that can be named. Imagine a statue of Ronald Regan in the center of the park.

**Zaggurant**:	There was a population increase thingy that added 100 techs, even though ed+immigration dropped us 20


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ed is based off of happiness so just wait until the pios and settlers stop dropping then i will supply the sst  and the ed should be just enough to keep the tech up. If not we can build a university and never supply it because it would provide a multiplier to ed without supply.


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Or other ed building they all provide some multiplier


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I can also run ed programs to increase the tech


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Not_Trey**:	Good Afternoon Verdant, What is your guys opinion on a state run lottery similar to powerball in ways, and other government run things like verdant loans ect.


[03-Dec-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Lottery sounds good, could be fun to pay some extra taxes that way and have it be a bit of a social thing. Doing loans might be bit risky?


[03-Dec-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I do agree loans would be risky, maybe for players past the 30 day mark can apply for a government loan


[03-Dec-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Right now before i plan anything I want to know what you guys think of more government run things


[03-Dec-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	If you're up for it and it makes the game more fun, sounds great! Just dont burn yourself out :)


[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	Lottery sounds fun if properly done


[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Loans to kickstart 30d players would be in everyones interests as long as it doesnt bankrupt the planet, the loan system is pretty flimsy.


[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	i agree with foefighter about the loans


[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yes


[03-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	they also provide less than 1% of taxes on the planet, currently are being ignored and abused, and there are open jobs. For the decrease in tech pop i turned taxes off for them because they are being ignored in favor of stabilizing pio and set pops

**Circle_of_Life**:	I agree with foefighter about new player loans, a 30k-100k loan as a new player to get facilities up would've been gold, and for players who need the engagement hook to stay with the community, it would build our galaxy seven fold.  I would've agreed to repay a month or two of operating profits, if someone loaned me the prefab cost to get my startup space filled out as an example


[03-Dec-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Loans yes


[03-Dec-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	But loans should also come with some kind of mentorship, to make them more reliable :D


[03-Dec-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	If i had government employees to monitor loans on a daily or bi daily basis that would be good


[03-Dec-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Government volunteers


[03-Dec-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	Is it possible? Can other people check contracts between players?


[03-Dec-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Submitting my application to be the lotto girl


[03-Dec-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I really meant something more like an "loan interview" before giving out the loan, to make sure the borrower knows what they're doing, then checking in once per week or so to see if they're having trouble. I might be able to volunteer to help out with something like that


[03-Dec-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I want to make the lotto similar to powerball where you pick 5 unique numbers from 1-30 and a unique one from 1-10 idk the actual stats on winning it but I will calculate it tomorrow. I want the chances of a jackpot to be like 1/10000 or something more possible than 1/10000000000 simply because of the small amount of players. The tickets I was thinking could be 100ncc each to make it so cheep why not play. The 50ncc of the ticket goes into the pot the rest back to the gov. Winner gets the whole pot. Drawings would be every Saturday. This is a very rough idea of what it could look like.


[03-Dec-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	you also have chances to win if some numbers are same like powerball


[03-Dec-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	and @turin is the lotto girl


[03-Dec-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	To play you would have to send me a private contract with the numbers and how many tickets plus the correct cost. to redeem your prizes you do the same thing. i am probably unable to create private contracts for each winner so it is up to you to collect your money. people found cheating the lottery would be publicly shamed and blacklisted by me.


[03-Dec-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Let me know how this sounds and if you all would want to play.

**ArcturusRex**:	fun! 🤩


[04-Dec-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I think the loans needs a bit of rework, perhaps we should offer interests to loaners who loan to verdant?


[04-Dec-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Instead of having the whole loan come from taxes, just put some subsidies for people who are already doing that stuff


[04-Dec-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Just worried we end up tieing alot of tax into loans and end up without a GOCG if they fail or something like that. On the same note im a bit worried about powerball, we're working with such small numbers of players that the maths of scale dont really apply, maybe a raffle with 1000 tickets (easier to calculate and not as suspect to chance) with rollover price might be better for simplicity and keeping the jackpot relatively low.


[04-Dec-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Good points foefighter


[04-Dec-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Verdant does also have a bit of a supply-issue, flying ships out full and coming back empty always hurts my soul so; Goverment run shuttle-service? Have a megaship running 10ncc/t runs to moira and bring back basemats/consumables for LM. (That would require a busdriver we trust with a very expensive ship..) Would free up our personal verdant ships to do CXL trade, lets have Verdantians take over the galaxy!


[04-Dec-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I do like the government bus idea. Do not worry too much about the cogc I have a large stockpile in reserve. The loans would be a lot and very risky. Power ball I figured out if we did 5 unique numbers 1-15 and one number 1-10 the chances are around 1/30000 meaning someone would have to by 30000 tickets or spend 3mil on tickets. I imagine if popular enough we could do that. Especially at such a cheep price. I really like the bus idea and will invest tax money into verdant shippers


[04-Dec-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	What kind do we want? 2/2 3/1 or 1/3

**shagie**:	FYI - there is a way to prevent certain corporations from accepting your shipping / buy / sell ads.  If you bring up the user info, you can 'block user' - this will not allow them to accept your ads.  This is managed with LMBL.

**bitbucket**:	So much work goes into all the stuff we use and it's all so terribly fragile. And most people are blissfully unaware of the entire process. Or dangerously ignorant of when, when it comes to legislators (like certain members of the U.S. Congress who think grocery stores grow all their food in the back room).

[04-Dec-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Foefighter**:	Well.. If you use excess taxes to make more profit in the form of a lottery I dont see how anyone could complain about that - They can opt out of the action and in the long run this will result in lower taxes due to increased profits (or atleast no tax increases)

[06-Dec-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@Gaby - the standard advice is when you fill your first permit.


[06-Dec-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Growing to Sand isn't that expensive - it lets you shift your FP from Verdant to Sand.  Expanding to Frost (also popular) is another option, but its pricy (lots of INS.IC1 used).


[06-Dec-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And why it looks like its "only" 200... its things like "you need 250x of it to build an EXT"


[06-Dec-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Something like half my base costs on my pending frost base are from ins


[06-Dec-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As "ugh" as INS is for a cost perspective, its less painful than the repairs when you need HSE.NC1 or TSH.NC1


[06-Dec-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The issue is that those are 1 / building, which means that every time you repair, you need to include that.


[06-Dec-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got an 86 day old EXT on Frost - it needs 7 BSE, 108 INS, and 43 MCG... but it _only_ needs 108 INS.


[06-Dec-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	That’s still like 20k worth of ins.  Seems like it would be better for HSE after like 60 days


[06-Dec-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider the practicality of MOR -> 705c -> Verdant -> beyond routes since the 705c will have a demand inbound that is much larger than the Verdant import demand.

**shagie**:	... but would that be worth it for chem for that there vs a CHP without a CoGC on c or d instead?


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Dunno... need to fill up what I've got there first.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	d is probs just going to be a resource extraction world


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - water and carbon.  It's the burner world for the area.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	might do a hybrid base down on d


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	mixture of ext and inc


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i need to sort out inc since my source of carbon has gone cold


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I ship 73 C and 725 H2O out of there per day currently.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and that's not even fully scaled for a single permit)


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i used to produce a lot of pe when my carbon source was running, now im dry


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And I'm doing medium burns because the demand for HCP outpaces what Verdant can grow reasonably... until I set up HYFs.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im still on ftms till i sort out 705c


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	which isnt happening till i have my ships sorted out


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll be contributing to the tax revenue there soon.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	there isnt tax on 705c, not till more people land there


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	there was a fight about it few months back


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	havent dared touch it since


[15-Dec-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	There, built up to 743/750 here on Verdant. Nothing left to fit into that last little bit of space. >_>   Would be nice if they came up with a few new tiny 1-3 size buildings that gave small bonuses so we could make the most of our base.

[15-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Multiplier = -2 * (UsedPermits / TotalPermits) + 3


[15-Dec-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If used = total, that's 1.  And so the multiplier is -2x1 + 3 = 1


[15-Dec-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But (for me) right now I have 7 of 9 permits used.  So -2x(7/9) + 3 = 1.44


[15-Dec-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And so the 4% bonus (no faction) for resource extraction is 4% * 1.44 = 5.8%


[15-Dec-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that's what shows up in my efficiency gains.  Its small, but its there.  Use the two permits and it goes back to 5%.


[15-Dec-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	12/15 permits used - 8.4% agriculture, 5.6% food industries


[15-Dec-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Definitely makes a difference, however small it is


[15-Dec-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(This is more noticeable if you're in say CIS where the bonus is 10% to manufacturing - where instead of x 5% its x10%)


[15-Dec-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I could imagine how crazy you could stack that to manufacture stuff if you really wanted to :o


[15-Dec-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing is that this bonus gets _less_ as you get more.


[15-Dec-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	1 free permit out of 2?  That's a big bonus.  1 free permit out of 30?  Small.

[19-Dec-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	so then your starter ships can be available for other things or other planets


[19-Dec-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(a) Wait for the politics / government update to see if there's something else to work on.  (b) Ships are non-transferable.  If you retire, that fleet disappears or goes with you.  (c) Part of the appeal of the area is that 3rd party shippers trying to get a foot in the economy by taking shipping contracts would be edged out.  People come to verdant to do shipping for others.

**shagie**:	Bing!  Hey, a new expert at 715... hmm... oh, resource extraction, and oh, yea... 5/5 for agri so he gets to sit on the bench with the other four resource extraction experts (one of 'em is doing their job watching the rigs).  But hey... 5 resource extraction experts.


[27-Dec-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Are they hanging with your FP experts too, or did you start on another planet?


[27-Dec-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	like are they sitting around drinking and playing cards all day, or what?


[27-Dec-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Four of those guys just sitting around.  The 5th will be a long time waiting since I'm scaled back on FP here.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Is it common for people to do FP here? I was doing it until recently, but now I've moved FP to another planet and it seems my bottleneck is the number of farms I have


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	So it worked great when Verdant was my only base, but I didn't see the point of keeping anything but farms after


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When I started, I did some FP here... I think I was up to 9x of them before I expanded to Frost.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I have just enough here now to self supply RAT and DW.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I had 7xFRM 7xFP here and now I'm 12xFRM and then 15xFP on Sand


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I just recently stopped doing the self-sufficiency thing on RAT and DW as well and just buy it


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I don't even have my RIGs anymore - still operating on the surplus I generated from 6x of them in the past few months


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I could spin down the 3x FP, though that would only free up 36 space which is a FRM and a bit... and I'd really want a STO then to make sure I have enough stock.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	fun trick is the warehouses here are free, so I have a bunch of stuff shoved in there


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got those full of exports.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	that's fair, I don't produce much yet and have ships moving more than I want currently


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I run Proxion that way though... it only has one FP and no RIGs. Otherwise all FRMs.  I import 2500 water there every other week.


[27-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I've been eyeing Proxion ever since I've seen you mention it. Definitely hyped to get enough money to set up a third base


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The difficulty with Proxion is that it is _dry_.  You'll need to buy or import all the water.


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	yeah a bit of a pain. Well, I'm doing my first ship upgrade so I'll have better cargo bays


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant produces 16 water / rig / cycle.  Proxion produces 2.


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	ouch


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Most people in Benten space who work with water and agri expand out to Etherwind for a pump.  Nice place (much more habitable than Frost).


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	reminds me of my first start. I was trying to do carbon on Montem and water was a real issue. This time around I've been doing good


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I like this planet, but definitely realize I'd probably have been better off starting on Promitor or somewhere else. oh well


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Montem and Vallis are traps for the new players who think they can get a completely self sufficient base there.  And while you _can_ the margins then are so low that you're barely making enough to ship the FE to Moria.


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	moria and vallis are both crap for agri due to negitive fertility


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I was only making ~2000NCC a day there, was terrible\


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Even Forst with its INS costs can make more money making H2O and just selling that (with current prices, a 2500 load of H2O.NC1 sells fairly nicely...)


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	also verdant is good since its fairly close to 705c which is one of the best halite sources in game (if you put aside thee sheer cold)


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	once you get chem set up there you will be loaded


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	plus I feel like I've learned more in the Verdant chat lurking than anywhere else


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wereii**:	hello/


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Always nice to see new starts out here.  And you've got a provisional license already - very helpful for verdanites... verdantonains? green people?


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant has a lot going on in its local market for shipping.  My first month of the game, a good two thirds of my revenue was from shipping contracts.


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	yeah I think I have backed the game before, thats why the LIC


[27-Dec-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The PRO license lapses to a basic one.  You can still pick up LM ads then.


[27-Dec-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(PRO lapsing to BASIC rather than FREE s one of the best deals of all web games I've played)


[27-Dec-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	ah right, yeah I am testing the waters, will see about pro later


[27-Dec-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've backed it before... under LIC at the top right, you probably see BASIC there.


[27-Dec-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	yep got it


[27-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Another thing to keep in mind, as a player with a basic license, you can accept contracts... including loans (added a few months ago).  There are some people who give loans to new players.


[27-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for new(er) players who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k; basic requirement for upgrade) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k; larger fuel tanks add range). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. Reminder that I do not provide hull plates or SSC for the upgrade. DM me if you are interested :)


[28-Dec-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gassim**:	Why 2000/300 and not 300/2000? Is that a european thing?


[02-Jan-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	It's the difference between Weight and Volume availble on a ship


[02-Jan-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	First number is Weight in Tons, so 2000. Second number is Volume in cubic meters (m3), which is 300


[02-Jan-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Starter ships have 500/500. My ship is an upgrade to allow me to carry items that have a high weight, but lower volume.


[02-Jan-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	@Gassim welcome to the game btw


[02-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While I sent over HCP in that 300, I've also got 200 MAI that's going to get shipped at some point.


[02-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	200 MAI has a mass of 260 t while only takes up 200 m3 of space.  A ship with a high load cargo bay (the 3000 / 1000 mentioned) would be able to haul that more efficiently.


[02-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Rations are another example - 200 RAT is 42t and 20 m3.

**Wereii**:	good read:) am still far from filling up my first base but I did wonder about that carbon/resource extraction as next thing


[08-Jan-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The closest resource extraction planet that people tend to use is Frost.  It's on the chilly side, but it also makes a nice logistics run through Midway.

[09-Jan-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I know a browser game, where is possible to haul fleet in a carrier...


[09-Jan-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	fighters, assaults and even small miners


[09-Jan-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k; basic requirement for upgrade) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k; larger fuel tanks add range). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. Reminder that I do not provide hull plates or SSC for the upgrade.

**Not_Trey**:	I have just realized something strange but cool with our population. We may not need popi anymore just a weekly 50k to keep tech pop up. The pios pop have settled down and produce enough ed for settlers to stay stable. I think if we invested into ed popi for the flat education bonus we can get our weekly costs to 0


[11-Jan-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	It may cost a lot initially but it may save us the most money in the long run


[11-Jan-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	the numbers show the passive ed bonus is irrelevant at this size


[11-Jan-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	welp all i can do now is lower taxes and fine tune it for 50k a week and pay the weekly tech immigration


[11-Jan-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I have done my job as governor now i am just here for weekly programs boys. Enjoy the greatest planet in the universe.


[11-Jan-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	maybe after this success i should head over to other huge starter worlds and optimize the crap out of them


[11-Jan-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	i will slowly lower the taxes until they are satisfactory to cover 50k weekly then i will prob hand it off to someone else to simply keep up the weekly programs.


[11-Jan-24 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	If only i could be governor of multiple worlds. I cant wait. When number go up no longer satisfies me number go down does.


[11-Jan-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	If anyone has a specific planet they want me to attempt to get taxes down just tell me i will run where ever there is a challenge.


[11-Jan-24 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The weekly costs are prob more than 50k i forgot the cogc


[11-Jan-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Costs weekly are 184k


[11-Jan-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Not_Trey**:	Guys i want to stimulate the shipping industry on verdant. as a tax haven and starter planet the only down side to the place is the distance from the cx


[21-Jan-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	i wish we could build a cx on verdant


[21-Jan-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	that would make this place perfect


[21-Jan-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I put about 200 - 400 tons of goods outbound daily.  The biggest challenge is _inbound_ loads to the planet / sasystem.


[21-Jan-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	we need a cx


[21-Jan-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	hear me out guys, verdant to hubur break away from neo and make a new frontier faction with a cx on verdant


[21-Jan-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	We'd need something downstream from Verdant that needs a lot of shipping.


[21-Jan-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Construction world, or chem world or something?


[21-Jan-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the only thing I really import to Verdant is construction materials and some occasional consumables (I admittedly have a pretty small base, but still)


[21-Jan-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	otherwise it's all fairly basic resources headed outward


[21-Jan-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Yeah; for all the stuff that gets shipped out of here, virtually nothing gets shipped back. Setting up an industrial-focused planet in the area might help remedy that...

[22-Jan-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-24 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Perhaps, or a way to fund further development of a F2P game. You only need to buy it for one month, and then once it expires you get a BASIC licence, which allows you to accept local ads, post shipping ads on Stations/CX, and you can accept custom contracts


[28-Jan-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	If this was live, I would have no issues with features being locked behind a licence like that. But you also want enough people to play the game to find flaws/exploits etc. Hardly an mmo when daily peak is less then 1k people

**Cactusroc**:	Where can I order COF for my workers?


[28-Jan-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	Or resources at all? Where is the market tab


[28-Jan-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	you need to look at the closest commodity exchange


[28-Jan-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	closest from here is Moria Station


[28-Jan-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah, dependin on what you set your speed to itll be about 1d 4h trip each way


[28-Jan-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	I had to rent a warehouse, is there somewhere I can see the prices for goods?


[28-Jan-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	I dont want to overpay


[28-Jan-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	open the NC1 exhange


[28-Jan-24 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	oke thanks


[28-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	I bought product, now how do I transfer them to my base?


[28-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	you need to pick it up with one of your ships


[28-Jan-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	if you are just starting out, like me, you need Padded work overalls aswell


[28-Jan-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	yes indeed


[28-Jan-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Have you gone through the tutorial videos? They are a great guide and give you free resources to get started


[28-Jan-24 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	yes I have


[28-Jan-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	So I bought these good in the exchange, but they are not showing up in the warehouse I rented


[28-Jan-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	Where can I watch the goods I bought?


[28-Jan-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'm flying there before I buy, so I can't tell you. But I would think it depends on the volume of the goods, whether a warehouse is needed or not


[28-Jan-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	are you sure u bought them in the same exchange as where the warehouse is? Or u bought them. Check CXOS and CONTS.


[28-Jan-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	type them in a NEW BFR. left bottom corner of the screen


[28-Jan-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	Yes because I see negative cash


[28-Jan-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	It says in the conts that I need to pick them up at moria station


[28-Jan-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	My ship is moving, I guess I can cancel the warehouse


[28-Jan-24 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u see them in CONTS then u dont have the capacity to place them all. which is i find it odd. (unless u bought hefty amount or weight. pls make sure u rented warehouse in moria station.


[28-Jan-24 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	I bought 50 PWO and 10 COF


[28-Jan-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	I rented in Moria Montem


[28-Jan-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	montem is not the exchange station. its a planet


[28-Jan-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	aha


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	and the exchange is in space I guess?


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	yeah.


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	oke I see


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	see a map


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	MS OT-580


[28-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	left side bar click CXL then click moria station(moria)


[28-Jan-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	then Moria Station Warehouse.


[28-Jan-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cactusroc**:	got it, thanks


[28-Jan-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	or you can SYSI OT-580 and scroll bottom

[28-Jan-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	As a new player, is it worth it trying to become selfsufficient to meet all demands for pioneers before moving to settlers?


[28-Jan-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yes


[28-Jan-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	by doing multiple bases or having one doing it all?


[28-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	most of my stuff i produce myself. i only need to import CAF, COT and C for COF, PWO and PE


[28-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	hydrogen i pull from another base i have


[28-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Interesting


[28-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah, i have enough resources stockpiled to last me a fair while


[28-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One base self sufficency attempts are often marginally profitable at best.


[28-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah youd need a few bases


[28-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I just started today, so just thinking about my options atm

Guide to being a farmer


[28-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	focus on food and drinking water. want a bit of extra income build collectors for oxygen


[28-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I went with food and water actually


[28-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	same thing as carbon farmer


[28-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With carbon, its a "build an INC and burn some GRN" ... which isn't a bad thing to do if you have surplus.


[28-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	now I'm looking at if it would be worth having the production facilities to make OVE, or if I should just buy whenever I need those


[28-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nope.  Don't make OVE here.


[28-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aye, plus local carbon is nice for people who make PE (me) for ove


[28-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	free licence, so can't use markets


[28-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	big downside


[28-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	OVE takes a BMP... and that's 100 PIO - you'd need a HB1 just for them... and you will have difficulty making enough RCO to keep it busy.


[28-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	rco takes a bit to grow as well


[28-Jan-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'd need 1 RCO every 7h... which means 2x FRMs just growing RCO.


[28-Jan-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i have enough stocked to last me a while from 6 frms


[28-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	oddly enough havent seen much carbon here which i would love to have


[28-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Most INCs tend to move to Frost.


[28-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im gonna be using that for a water extraction base


[28-Jan-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	use that C planet for hydroponics probs


[28-Jan-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pick up a load of agri, ship it to Sand, drop off all but the GRN you need, pick up some RAT, head to Frost, pick up C and H2O, ship the H2O back to Sand to make DW, pick up more sellables, and ship the C and stuff to MOR.


[28-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i still need a source of N and limestome for 705c


[28-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Thx for the imput, I will run some numbers while I raise some cash over the next few days


[28-Jan-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	probs hit up bastion for limestone and kub for nitrogen


[28-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	YI-059f (cold gas world) for a high N concentration.


[28-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also in the area is WB-947h


[28-Jan-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That one is cold and high gravity... 059f would be better.


[28-Jan-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	its on the route i take to moria anyways


[28-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got PMMG, XIT PROSPERITY and you can do a good search for resources.


[28-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	got pmmg installed


[28-Jan-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	another question, since the Moria market is quite far, how whats a good number of days to aim for between trips?


[28-Jan-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was thinking about maybe once a week


[28-Jan-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As often as you need, but no more.


[28-Jan-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Early on, you'll find that you'll be doing "oh, I want to expand, that's a bunch of BBH and BSE and..."


[28-Jan-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For me, that shipping was something that prompted me to get a PRO license.


[28-Jan-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'll have to see it the game has enough for me to warrent a licence


[28-Jan-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	8 USD for one month adds a lot of quality of life for that month, and permant a bunch of other stuff too.


[28-Jan-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, you're asking "is it worth going to MOR now?"  Well, what if you could pick up another 4000 NCC of stuff that's currently on the LM and haul that with the RAT you intend to sell?


[28-Jan-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that "what if..." part is something you'll be able to do forever with one month of PRO license.


[28-Jan-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	My ship is already on its way, no cargo


[28-Jan-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	next time, I'll fill it up as much as I can before going again


[28-Jan-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pull up LM YI-715b


[28-Jan-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	All of that is stuff that you could interact with if you had a PRO or BASIC license.


[28-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	and LM MOR has a bunch more.


[28-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea I've noticed that


[28-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	does feel like its a bit of a waste flying empty


[28-Jan-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  Small shipments can eat up a lot of revenue in operational costs.


[28-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	How long have you played the game and how much time do you roughly spend on it daily?


[28-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I like the fact that everything is real time, just like eve online


[28-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	$SLRP -- 219 days now.


[28-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Chat, a bit.  _Playing_ depends on how much I'm planning.


[28-Jan-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	feels like you can cover everything in 30 mins when you get into it


[28-Jan-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm in an expansion phase right now where things get a little weird and unabalanced.  There's a ship in parts at MOR that needs to get assembled, a few bases are at yellow in logistics, and I just set up a new base on Kiruna that has no food....


[28-Jan-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(the ship that normally serves the Verdant - Sand - Frost route is the one that set up Kiruna... and so Verdant is at 7 days on DW because I haven't back hauled this way yet... and Midway needs some more VEG from Verdant... and Circe needs DW too...


[28-Jan-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sand "only" has 14 days of water in its inventory (thats 9000 units of water) that's being changed into DW at 350 / day... which needs to get to Verdant and Circe and ...


[28-Jan-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, I can see it will get more time consuming as time goes on


[28-Jan-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The AdHoc is hauling some C from Frost to Moria (tommorow morning) where it will pick up DW and ... probably some H too and take that to Circe along with anything else on the LM that's headed that way.


[28-Jan-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Might pick up the ship parts and fuel and set that up for ship assembly while on that way... (note: don't forget the fuel when building a ship)


[28-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other ship is getting into Proxion tonight (8h from now) and will pick up RAT and HER and probably some extra agri... and drop off the RAT on Kiruna while taking the HER and agri up to Moria where I'll pick up some AMM and HOP and maybe some BFabs too and drop that off on Sand...


[28-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I don't think I can have more then two ships on a free licence


[28-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nope.  That's a PRO thing.


[28-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You won't hit that "I really want more ships" for a few months.


[28-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	another question - should I build out this location before trying to expand at another?


[28-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you do get PRO for a month, take adavantage of that window to upgrade your starter ships.


[28-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I tend to suggest first filling up the full permit on Verdant.


[28-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, good to know


[28-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Adding another base adds more logistical things... if you don't have the import and export demand to satisfy the other base, you'll be doing a lot of partial loads that will eat into your revenue.


[28-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its 500/750/1k space right? So all 3

Guide to being a farmer


[28-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The most useful upgrade is the WCB - which has 3k t and 1k m3 of space.


[28-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's because things like RAT are heavier than they are bulky.


[28-Jan-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT takes up 2.1 : 1 ... so you can fit 10k RAT in a WCB but only 4760 in a medium (1k/1k)


[28-Jan-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, good info and good to know that I don't need to to looking at an other location just yet


[28-Jan-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Carbon is 2.25 : 1 -- same deal there.


[28-Jan-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nope - you can grow for quite a while (and reasonably) on Verdant.


[28-Jan-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'll expand my location and improve production over the next month, then see where I'm at


[28-Jan-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also check out the discords - there are a number of nice quality of life things out there.


[28-Jan-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PMMG extended is _so_ useful for condensing information.


[28-Jan-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FIO extension and website can help you build better spreadsheets for planning.


[28-Jan-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Prun planner can help forecast what you'll need for a given base setup.


[28-Jan-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, I'll have a look at that

[29-Jan-24 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	This game is a slow burn, literally and figuratively. There are some who are on all day, but most check a few things and come back tomorrow. You might try Discord, it's active


[29-Jan-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	How many do you think are actively playing?


[29-Jan-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-24 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EnemyCube**:	that's the great part of the Verdant start. now I'm constantly sending ships here or paying for contracts


[29-Jan-24 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I haven't looked much at contracts yet, only noticed that they are not possible to do without paying for the game. So I'll keep being free until I need to go to market again and then evaluate whether or not I should get a licence


[29-Jan-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you can do fine without them. but I save a lot of money for smaller shipments because fuel costs don't go down just because your ship is mostly empty. that and getting paid to move other people's stuff really offsets costs


[29-Jan-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	my first month basically I didn't ship much of anything and just lived on Verdant with a stockpile of OVE


[29-Jan-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Yes, that's my idea aswell, already got a bunch of tips on how to start up, now I just need time to pass

[29-Jan-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	How is this planet/local market in terms of activity compared to other places? I'm surprised with 200 people here, there are very few orders at the local market


[29-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	If more people used the local market, all would progress faster, right?


[29-Jan-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I could put up a few...


[29-Jan-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I bought what I need atm, I was just wondering


[29-Jan-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	since selling local would cut on transport costs


[29-Jan-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Still a lot I don't know about the game, so all I can compare it to is Eve online


[29-Jan-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Most activity tends to be shipping from Verdant to Sand or Moria.


[29-Jan-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Some Verdant to Frost.


[29-Jan-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Local production of other stuff tends to be limited since fertile world FRMs are more valueable.


[29-Jan-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And likewise, there's little import demand of other goods.


[29-Jan-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ok... there's about 1400 m3 of goods to ship out to Sand and Frost.


[29-Jan-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	if everyone did like that, there would always be something to move


[29-Jan-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I produce about 300 m3 of goods each day to ship.  You're seeing the weekend of me forgetting to do it.


[29-Jan-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and that my hauler is currently on a different route because I just set up a base there... and that messed up my logistics for a bit.


[29-Jan-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, I know you are way ahead of me in production capacaty, I was just wondering about the lack of market activity


[29-Jan-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Weekends are both slow and fast... people slow to put up new ads and people fast to take the ones that were there and clear it out as they continue on their shipping routes.


[29-Jan-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	do you set any buy orders here? Or do you try to make/bring everything yourself


[29-Jan-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sometimes... but its rare (for me) to need to buy something here.


[29-Jan-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll sell into a buy order if its reasonably priced and a quantity that I have.


[29-Jan-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Want 1000 HCP at 250?  Sorry, I rarely have more than 200 or so on hand.


[29-Jan-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Want 100 HCP at 150?  Sorry, I'm going to ship that to Frost and make some C.


[29-Jan-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and as I say that... I need to get a ship down this way with stuff.


[29-Jan-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've been slacking on those... OVE,NC1 @150e and PWO.NC1 @ 400e buy items up.


[29-Jan-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and I've also posted some shipping for Sand -> Verdant.


[29-Jan-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Does anyone here make FIM? Roughly 165/day? Or a couple of people that do 80-90/day?

**FieldBear**:	I have a question: I saw that FRMs are very valubale. As a new player should I focus on expanding my FRMs and just import H2O and export the ag products for refinement into RATs elsewhere?


[29-Jan-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For a new player, in Verdant, balance RIGs.  Importing water will cost you more time and fuel at this time.


[29-Jan-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Later, if you run out of space for FRMs (or RIGs) you can then decide how you want to expand and if you want to be shipping water (from Moria) back a day and a half here ... and if you mistime that, then you have idle farms.


[29-Jan-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FieldBear**:	OK, thanks. Should I also expand my FPs? Or just focus on ag products?


[29-Jan-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	_Personally_ I run a slight water surplus here rather than a deficit.  Shipping water to Proxion... that's another matter.


[29-Jan-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Additional refinment gets better markup ... you'll make more selling RAT (10 RAT.NC1 = 1 GRN.NC1 + 1 BEA.NC1 + 1 VEG.NC1)


[29-Jan-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i run ten rigs, 6 frms, 7 fps and i run surplus


[29-Jan-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So roughly, 1100 NCC for about 600 NCC worth of input (if you were to sell directly)


[29-Jan-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	23 FRMs, 9 RIGs.


[29-Jan-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FieldBear**:	OK, thanks again for the help. I've balanced my production so I have no deficits, so I'll just continue doing that.


[29-Jan-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FieldBear**:	If I did the math correctly.


[29-Jan-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(no FP here).  Proxion (the agri world for Ben space) I've got 11 FRMs, 1 FP and no RIGs ... and 4800 H2O in the inventory.


[29-Jan-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Prun Planner is _really_ helpful for balancing production.


[29-Jan-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FieldBear**:	OK, I'll take a look into that, thanks!


[29-Jan-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-24 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Planning on offering RAT,DW on local market soon, looking for OVE and PWO. Then in 3-4 weeks time, start looking "settler" related goods


[30-Jan-24 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I will sell COF aswell, but atm its too expensive to me to get into


[30-Jan-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Why do we have two local market btw?


[30-Jan-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Nwm, I can see that every planet can have a local market


[30-Jan-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	theres a main exchange where trading occurs and then there's the planet markets


[30-Jan-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, but if more things were sold on the local market, less travel would be needed


[30-Jan-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	also free accounts cant use the local markets


[30-Jan-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	you need to use the exchange


[30-Jan-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I know, but its a 1 time buy currently, after default, I would still be able to buy from there, but would be unable to post anything


[30-Jan-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	what have you gone as?


[30-Jan-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	food producer


[30-Jan-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	that solves two of your problems then


[30-Jan-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	buy ove from the exchange ( moria ) and focus on building up rigs, frms and fps.


[30-Jan-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	thats what I'm doing


[30-Jan-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ship should be back from first trip in about 5 hours


[30-Jan-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	it starts off slow. like really slow and you will have hairy moments with cash but once you have gotten a steady supply of goods you will be alright


[30-Jan-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I don't mind the slow part, but it does not feel very "mmo" like yet, wonder if that will happen ever


[30-Jan-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ever played eve online?


[30-Jan-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, several years


[30-Jan-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	its like eve, just without the fighting


[30-Jan-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I played eve for the "industry" part, so its very much the same


[30-Jan-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	if you want extra cash early set up a collector for oxygen


[30-Jan-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	only here, I don't feel like I'm part of anything yet, still too early to tell if that will happen


[30-Jan-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah small people find it hard, if you can find a corp to join. the biggest im aware of is GTU


[30-Jan-24 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	if memory serves me right theres about 90 people in that corp


[30-Jan-24 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	slow is fine, part of the challenge


[30-Jan-24 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aye its still slow and ive got three bases


[30-Jan-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i suggest using your second ship as storage for the time being, dump its fuel to use in the other ship. once you have a fair amount of production running then bring the other ship online


[30-Jan-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, no reason to use more then one atm


[30-Jan-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	what i did till i had four frms, 4 col, 1 bmp, 4 fp and 6 rigs


[30-Jan-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I can see the logic in trying to be selfsufficient, but at the same time, I would rather focus a bit more and then buy/trade more things


[30-Jan-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	if the goal for everyone is to be selfsufficient, it kinda defeats the mmo part. Might aswell play single player then


[30-Jan-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	focus on producing food and drinking water, if you really want to push it then geta bmp to make ove


[30-Jan-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'll most likely get a bmp later, but I need higher production first. No sense in having it, if I can't run in 100% of the time


[30-Jan-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	it is 100 pioneers after all


[30-Jan-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I noticed my production line condition is 100% - how long until it decays?


[30-Jan-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's an interesting topic... the one line answer is "do it before 180 days" though you'll start to see slow degregration sooner.  It has a curve for the impact and the specifics of when is best is a complicated sheet.

[30-Jan-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its chemistry, fuel refining and resource extraction at 8% btw


[30-Jan-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant is in the "outer reaches" - the planet isn't in NCC faction space.


[30-Jan-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
***tkern.1** left.*


[30-Jan-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Since your HQ is here, you get a bonus to chemistry, fuel refining, and resource extraction (RIGs get a bonus - as do EXT, COL, and INC).


[30-Jan-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can move your HQ to another base you have once per 30 days, and change which bonuses you get.


[30-Jan-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, so something thats specific to the "outer reaches"?


[30-Jan-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	the link says 4% - I got 8 though


[30-Jan-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Multiplier = -2 * (UsedPermits / TotalPermits) + 3


[30-Jan-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Multiply the 4% by that number.


[30-Jan-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got 1 used permit out of 3 total.  So (-2 * 1/3) + 3 ... and then display rounding.


[30-Jan-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	oh, right


[30-Jan-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The tangent to that is that if you don't _need_ to use a permit, don't - you'll get bigger bonuses.


[30-Jan-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It also is more impacting on new users than established ones (you get bigger bonuses more eaislly)


[30-Jan-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 9 used permits out of 12 ... so my multiplier is less.


[30-Jan-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	lots of little things to pay attention to


[30-Jan-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Trying to model a base in a spread sheet can be quite a challenge.


[30-Jan-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	haven't started on that yet, just a few numbers in excel sofar


[30-Jan-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and that's a _good_ challenge type thing)


[30-Jan-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You might want to try Google Sheets.


[30-Jan-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	=IMPORTDATA("https://rest.fnar.net/csv/recipeoutputs")


[30-Jan-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	excel might need some more setup compared to sheets


[30-Jan-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  Several of the CSV things that rest.fnar does are better supported on Google Sheets.


[30-Jan-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was hoping to find either a sheet or an excel document to get me started and then picking out what I needed to know


[30-Jan-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	but nothing I coulden't make myself in a few hours. Setup is still only day 3, not that complicated yet


[30-Jan-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The tooling discord - https://discord.gg/ZT9VJDt


[30-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	have to say that part a new/low pop game is also that you can't lookup everything


[30-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's where the fio.fnar questions get answered, and can work through some questions too.


[30-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the challenges of today's world of online is that discord isn't that eaislly discoverable to search engines and getting documentation out of discord can be difficult.


[30-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, thats true


[30-Jan-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm on 6 different Prun discords, 3 moderate activity (the other 3I spectate).  Main, UFO, and PCT... Then I'm there for the "whats going on" with GTU, Evil, and ADI.


[30-Jan-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	thats quite a lot, just to play one game


[30-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Main discord for the main discord - that's where the devs are.  The player one where pirate reports and trade is UFO and then PCT is for the tooling.


[30-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Things like "How can we use PMMG to make the FLT buffer even smaller"


[30-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(the single character status idea was mine)


[30-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So instead of seeing "Lift off" I see "↑"


[30-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	oh cool


[30-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Because I don't care _too_ much about that once its on its way... but its nice to see.


[30-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	did you do the math on when its "worth" starting to use COF to increase production?


[30-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I used Prun Planner ... and only had one planet where clicking COF didn't increase the profit / day ... and that was because I was trying to put RIGs on Proxion in that build.


[30-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	oh I know it will increase production. The question is if its enough to warrent the extra cost, being on day 3 I don't see it as an option until I can produce it myself


[30-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Buying it atm, would cut too much into profits


[30-Jan-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It always improves profit.


[30-Jan-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One trick for a world with a FP... you can save a little bit on price by buying CAF.NC1 instead and brewing your own.


[30-Jan-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, planning on growing the CAF and then refining that to COF later on


[30-Jan-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Growing CAF ... is a bit more difficult.


[30-Jan-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Since you need a HYF and those get thirsty - need a LOT of RIGs to support it.


[30-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	not that many actually, 4 rigs here will almost support it running full time


[30-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	To have one HYF growing CAF, you would need 88 H2O / day ... so that's 11 cycles of a RIG per day... 3 or 4 RIGs depending on bonuses.


[30-Jan-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's for one HYF.


[30-Jan-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://prunplanner.org/plan/YI-715b


[30-Jan-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Try it out - see what makes the most profit.


[30-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is my setup for Verdant.  https://prunplanner.org/shared/3192a209-6a19-47cf-8297-adf122c4cbb9


[30-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'll do some quick math in excel, I want to build a few other things before the HYF though


[30-Jan-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Remeber that HYFs take PIO and SET ... so you will need those consumables too.


[30-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, I'm aware


[30-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And the repair costs are based on the building materials ... so you'll need 4x LBH.NC1 and 16x MHL.NC1 and factor that into degregation costs.


[30-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The repair costs of a FRM are 21 NCC / day.


[30-Jan-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and you can put an HYF on any world (not just fertile ones).  So places like Bastion c can be interesting.


[30-Jan-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Need to sell alot of RAT.nc1 before getting there


[30-Jan-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	how do you link things?


[30-Jan-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(aside - current prices for CAF appear to be lower than cost)


[30-Jan-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	case sensitive when typing?

[30-Jan-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	interesting that people are selling below cost, guess they don't factor everything in


[30-Jan-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	oh they are just doing napkin math like me :D


[30-Jan-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's below cost for me ... here on Verdant, with the price of water and other things.


[30-Jan-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If your cost of water is cheaper, if you're discounting the LST you sell yourself to make the NS... it can be cheaper than buying everything at current CX prices.


[30-Jan-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	would be interesting if there were to do a true player driven economy like eve


[30-Jan-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Much much more true player driven are you looking for?


[30-Jan-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	fully player driven


[30-Jan-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	no sinks or vendors


[30-Jan-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	EVE has some rather major sinks with blowing things up and ammo.


[30-Jan-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	with sink I means vendors you can sell surplus goods to


[30-Jan-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	just poor wording


[30-Jan-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And the arbitrage on NPC goods are a faucet of currency in EVE.


[30-Jan-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	outer areas having better planets but in order to get there, you would need impoved logistics etc


[30-Jan-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ZahnP**:	I wish it wasen't required to play to use local markets though


[30-Jan-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I like it... but Verdant is the country side compared to the bustle of OT-580 and the ships there.

**ZahnP**:	pay*


[30-Jan-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Promitor and Hortus station are easier if you want to be able to do it all in system.


[30-Jan-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I lived in providence in even when I started out, the worst part of space when it came to ressources


[30-Jan-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So... back in August, there was a player who bought PRO and decided to be an ass.  He accepted every contract on every LM and then stole the stuff.  He eventually got kicked out of the game and banned.  And since it was with PRO, that ban is a bit stickier.


[30-Jan-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	but grew friendships and business partners over time, and ended up supplying ships for several wars


[30-Jan-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider the work you'd have to do to make sure that every single player who signed up with the goal of "owning the spreadsheet nerds" wasn't able to be as disruptive.


[30-Jan-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	would be easy to fix, have people put up a deposit for taking a contract


[30-Jan-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	worked well in eve


[30-Jan-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The shipments I've got up on the LM right now... you wouldn't be able to afford to carry one of them.


[30-Jan-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'm 3 days in, so ofc not, but having it as an option


[30-Jan-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	leaves the concract creator with a choice


[30-Jan-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you put up an escrow deposit on it that matched the value of it, new players would rarely be able to get into shipping.


[30-Jan-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gating the player interactions behind paying is the easiest way to prevent it... and remeber that devs gotta eat and the servers need to humm.


[30-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	There is already a system that rates people, like 1 stolen contract like that and ppl would be blacklisted


[30-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If all the game functionality was free, how do you feed the devs and the servers?


[30-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The stolen contract is something that happens in 3 days when they don't deliver.


[30-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can accept LOTS of contracts in 3 days.


[30-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	limit the number of contracts for free people, those paying should have perks


[30-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is going down the path of "less incentive for people to buy a pro license so devs can eat."


[30-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And several of the things are the way they are because it was too easy to abuse LM contracts (and contracts in general) if the person didn't have any skin in the game.


[30-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	You scare more away by limiting key parts of the game straight away


[30-Jan-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I started out free in eve aswell, pretty soon I found that it was worth pay for monthly


[30-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I might not get to that point here, because I'm just locked out of things


[30-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	anyway, I like that game, just think some things should be handled differently

**Wereii**:	for this case at least


[30-Jan-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The poem is Fire and Ice by Robert Frost.  It was about the end of the world.  Frost asked Harlow Shapley about how the world would end ... and he thought it would end in fire or ice... and from that, Robert Frost wrote a poem.

"Fire and Ice" is a short poem by Robert Frost that discusses the end of the world, likening the elemental force of fire with the emotion of desire, and ice with hate. It was first published in December 1920 in Harper's Magazine and was later published in Frost's 1923 Pulitzer Prize-winning book New Hampshire. "Fire and Ice" is one of Frost's be...

[01-Feb-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Very similar fertility to Verdant.


[01-Feb-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's Proxion.  ... but where's the _next_ closest?

**Blacksail**:	proxin has shit water


[01-Feb-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's why you buy it at Benten (or have a base at Etherwind ... or Frost) and ship it in by the kt.  I've got 2656 water in the inv that burn says is good for 74 days... and another 2000 in the warehouse.

[01-Feb-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Honestly, current rate I feel it could fill up by the weekend... but you might get lucky if one of the waves 30 days ago drops the number.

[01-Feb-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I've thought about doing chemicals as second, not sure what I want yet, will be a while before I got enough to run 2 bases anyway


[01-Feb-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	that reminds me, should I be upgrading my HQ anytime soon? that res. extraction gain sure looks nice but does not seem worth the price yet


[02-Feb-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	The extra bases do more to boost you rather than the HQ bonus.  And the queue slots if you need them


[02-Feb-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	right


[02-Feb-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Some of the steps are cheap enough you can just do them for the quick bonus, but the max HQ bonus is pretty small

[07-Feb-24 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	If the reciever has an active licence then yes, you need to have a basic one also

**Pharnacis**:	So, it looks like my farms are going to need more water than one rig will produce, and other people also want to buy water sometimes.


[11-Feb-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I take it making multiple rigs is recommended?


[11-Feb-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Once I have the materials, anyway?


[11-Feb-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Multiple RIGs on Verdant are common.


[11-Feb-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Thanks.


[11-Feb-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I have about 2 FRMs per RIG... but the exact numbers depends on what agri you grow.


[11-Feb-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Yeah, I noticed the ratios are different depending on the exact choice for the farmstead production.


[11-Feb-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	NUT is low water... VEG uses more.  GRN can be put to growing even faster with more water.


[11-Feb-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	And it looks like you need three different food types to make a RAT


[11-Feb-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A grain (GRN or MAI), a glyceride (NUT or VEG), and a protein (BEA).


[11-Feb-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Makes *10* RATs


[11-Feb-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Yeah. There's also an ALG listed, which I guess is for a different starting setup. Algae doesn't seem to be an option on my farms.


[11-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	ALG and MUS are made in HYFs.


[11-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Hydroponics Farms - which don't need fertile soil... but are VERY thirsty.


[11-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Ahhh, the settler version of a farm, looks like.


[11-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I see. So those take even more water, too.


[11-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And the repairs of the HYF are a bit more $$ than the FRM.


[11-Feb-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A farm uses 4 BSE.NC1 and 4 BBH.NC1 - and repairing that isn't bad.


[11-Feb-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A HYF uses 2 BSE.NC1, 4 LBH.NC1, 16 MHL.NC1 and 4 TRU.NC1


[11-Feb-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That 16x MHL can be a bit of a "ouch" when repair time comes around.


[11-Feb-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	However, a HYF _also_ only takes up half the room of a FRM... so if you've got the water, you can run two of them in the game area.


[11-Feb-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I see. Yeah, I'm trying to keep things simple so I don't accidentally make stuff I can't afford to maintain.

[11-Feb-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I noticed my ships seem to take wear and tear damage pretty quickly.


[11-Feb-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A little bit, yes... don't worry about it until it gets into the 80s.


[11-Feb-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Some systems are worse than others.


[11-Feb-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Look at the "Micrometeroid density" for YI-715 and YI-705 and OT-580


[11-Feb-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Oh, so we have a higher mm density than Moria by far.


[11-Feb-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep, but there are worse systems.


[11-Feb-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	So was Verdant "historically" settled as a breadbasket because the main systems didn't have enough food?


[11-Feb-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Expansion seems to be player-driven and all?


[11-Feb-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  You'll often see a foothold go down and then a system becomes more viable as there's more commerce there.


[11-Feb-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Oh, pro license) The Local Market (LM) is often quite helpful on planets further away from the CX.


[11-Feb-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Keep your eyes on LM YI-715b -- you can pick up some shipping contracts and offset some of your own costs if you're heading to Moria.


[11-Feb-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I picked up some contracts to deliver stuff to Frost and Midway before sending my ships out


[11-Feb-24 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Checking the LM was also how I saw that people want to buy water, lol.


[11-Feb-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Stuff to Frost was likely mine.


[11-Feb-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Yeah, it was your company, looks like.


[11-Feb-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and looking, yep, you've got a few of 'em)


[11-Feb-24 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Make sure to ping me before you leave - so that I can give you a contract to go somewhere else.


[11-Feb-24 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(leave Frost that is)


[11-Feb-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I can spin up some to haul to Midway or Moria from there.


[11-Feb-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Alright. I was planning to send the ship to Moria next so I'd be able to buy fuel for the next trip too.


[11-Feb-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Looking... don't have a full 500t of C to haul yet (that goes to Moria) ... give it a day or two.


[11-Feb-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Should have it by the time you get there.


[11-Feb-24 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Okay. I can have the ship linger there until you're ready, then.


[11-Feb-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its another 5k ... which is better than hauling nothing for nothing.


[11-Feb-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Definitely.


[11-Feb-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	And my other ship will still be free to bring stuff back from a trade hub in the meantime.


[11-Feb-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Is it worthwhile to make a base or rent a warehouse on Moria?


[11-Feb-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Base: nope.  Only two baseable planets in the system ... and they're not that great.


[11-Feb-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I see.


[11-Feb-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I had a feeling that system was sort of "full" that way.


[11-Feb-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Warehouse at Moria - yes.  It becomes more useful if you've got bases on either side of Moria since those tend to form the center of shipping hubs.


[11-Feb-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But just having one there so that you can do "oh yea, I've got 300t of stuff sitting there that I should move" - hard to see that in contracts.


[11-Feb-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I sometimes uses warehouses as "bookmarks" - oh yea, this system looks neat... so I rent a warehouse for a low price... just as a reminder.


[11-Feb-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then I can quickly pull it up from INV.


[11-Feb-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Looks like it's only 100NCC a week. I'll go ahead and rent one.

[12-Feb-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	POPI upkeep.


[12-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	ohh I thought it was all donations


[12-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant was running with an "all programs" approach.  Compare with the donation need for POPID p-WB-675c t-SST


[12-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	Do we actually have insufficient infrastructure, or too many pops?


[12-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It _could_ be donations... but if they don't cover it, the gov is the one that has the "buck stops here" sign on their desk.


[12-Feb-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If there's a strike, the govenor is the one that should have the goods on hand to fix it.


[12-Feb-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	Do we actually have too high population?


[12-Feb-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Current PIO unemployment is about 12,000 ... which is a few built out 3 permit bases.


[12-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	We did kind of have an unemployment problem a few months back but the surplus labor was...encouraged to leave.


[12-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	Do other starter worlds have the same problem?


[12-Feb-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	If anything, the opposite problem. Though new startups bring 200 pioneers with them which takes some pressure off.


[12-Feb-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can't have a sudden 1500 person base appear on Promitor ... and even then, the larger population and 4.5% unemployment means they've got more spare if a new player got a mega loan and spun it all up at once.


[12-Feb-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(they have almost 500k PIO pop)


[12-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Electricfox**:	I just looked at the infrastructure. It does not seem to be consuming anything, like it's been turned off.


[12-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Electricfox**:	was that intentional?


[12-Feb-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A different approach to managing numbers - all programs and 0 upkeep.


[12-Feb-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Electricfox**:	Is it cheaper in the long run?


[12-Feb-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't know.  Possibly... but it may not be.  And that's not the answer you're looking for.


[12-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can do a festival... planetary festivals III for me on Sand costs 52,775 and gives all workers a 20% happiness boost.


[12-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But the flip side of that is all workers... so PIO, SET, and TEC ... but that means you've got less fine grained control over managing PIO happiness compared to SET.


[12-Feb-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The "in theory" you want unemployment somewhere between 5% and 10% depending on the size of the planet.  Higher might even be prefered for smaller planets (growing on YI-705c I hit a few times where I used up all the available unemployed pool and had open jobs ... and that was with only 100 or 200 or so)


[12-Feb-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Electricfox**:	We'll drop below 5% in a few weeks here for PIO, unless we do something


[12-Feb-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And thus the "how do you do it" - previsouly it was running technician immigration.  And if POPI upkeep is to be spun up again... that costs money.


[12-Feb-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Fortunately, it appears that the most important ones have the reserves topped out... so that looks to be a "turn it back on"


[12-Feb-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Setting the levels and maintaining that... there's an entire set of google sheets on that.

[12-Feb-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright, heres the thing. Verdant is a unique planet because of its heavy pio and set population. Safety and health produced by new bases is enough to keep the levels stable


[12-Feb-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its almost impossible for there to be a large deficit of workers for over a week


[12-Feb-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The hardest part is keeping the tech happy but it appears someone left and theres now only 300 tech required on this planet


[12-Feb-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its very easy to keep verdant at low upkeep the largest cost is the cogc


[12-Feb-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	weekly programs are the best way to maintain the pop


[12-Feb-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	basically ignore tech and above because they run the prices up on taxes and everything on this planet


[12-Feb-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	best way to make money imo as the gov is prob warehouses. keep the market free and taxes low.


[12-Feb-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I am a huge "lets keep taxes as low as possible" guy


[12-Feb-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I ran verdant at a net 0 because i produced everything for the cogc upkeep and technically the cost was the loss from the upkeep but I made my job Governor rather than business man


[12-Feb-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	If anyone has any questions on the population dynamics and what i have learned from verdant i am always available for a discord call to explain


[12-Feb-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
***userff9f4f2553** left.*


[13-Feb-24 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If you want to build a rich planet its normal for the taxes be higher.


[13-Feb-24 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	what does a rich planet get for us? Verdant seemed just fine


[13-Feb-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The more the population is satisfied the better they work.


[13-Feb-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And we should make the planet a nice place for them to live.


[13-Feb-24 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I don't intend to earn much money from governership. With the money i intend to pay for supplie and when i expand i will make materials necesery for upkeep and it will be cheaper.


[13-Feb-24 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	This is my first try so next time i will be prepared. The biggest cos for now is COGC.


[13-Feb-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	All the money i earn will be invested in the planet.


[13-Feb-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And I think the richer the planet the more we will make money.


[13-Feb-24 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And while im running the planet it would be nice if you tell me if u are earning more or less then before when i start investing so i know how to optimaze the population infrastracture and the taxes.


[13-Feb-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	On a sidenote - Could we ban orchards? I gathered we could be comfy at low tax if we dont allow techies here


[13-Feb-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	You can get a lot of profit from orchards and we raise the taxes a bit more for techs than pioneers and the planet is still cheap for pioneers if u have them.


[13-Feb-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Im not sure how the mechanics for pop but seems like we have to pour alot of resources into keeping 9 orchards happy


[13-Feb-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	There are planets that are already setup better for orchards


[13-Feb-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dont know yet how to ban buildings in Apex. If the owner of the base thinks he can earn money and contribute they shouldnt be banned.


[13-Feb-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	A planet is very poor and undeveloped of ot doesnt have any technicians.


[13-Feb-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	* if it.


[13-Feb-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Is that RP?


[13-Feb-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	What do you mean by RP role playing games or somethin else.


[13-Feb-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Well my problem atm is that the techies cost us alot, we have 9 orchards that the whole planet is basicly paying for when the tax is 10 for any pop, right?


[13-Feb-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I meant to ask does it have any real meaning if we're under-developed? We're a farming world, all we need is a plow and some oxen!


[13-Feb-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If i lower the taxes less than than i will loose a lot of money. And the estemate is i will loose 180000 NCC in 5 day if i dont get atlest some money for the taxes. taxes collected now are 2000 NCC


[13-Feb-24 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Thats not the problem, you're not required to eat the cost - problem is that the rich are getting a taxbreak here


[13-Feb-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	OK i now undestend and i agree but what do propose the tax should be for them the taxes were all 1 NCC before elected.


[13-Feb-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Is 30 NCC enough.


[13-Feb-24 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I'm not sure - I think the taxes should be big enough that you break even with the upkeep.


[13-Feb-24 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	But if we're spending 50% of the upkeep to keep 9 orchards happy then I want to get rid of the orchards so the whole planet can benefit


[13-Feb-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im trying to build a better place for the populace to live but i will raise taxes if thets what u want.


[13-Feb-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The richer the planet the nicer it is it to live on it.

**illuineru**:	calculate and change the taxes accordingly


[13-Feb-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	ty for the help


[13-Feb-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	How to set the planet to Verdant?


[13-Feb-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	In the spreadsheet I mean.


[13-Feb-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i really dont know. just know where to find the spreedsheet :D


[13-Feb-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	OK i will have try to figure that out.


[13-Feb-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	What do you guys think do u want a richer planet with a bit more taxes and buildings working as art caffe., Or are u happy whit it as is now.


[13-Feb-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Really you should just focus on keeping unemployment as low as possible, game is wonky in that  worker happiness is generally not really something you want to pursue forever. Just to grow population to the desired levels. After that you want to supply the minimum to keep that population on the planet.


[13-Feb-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Creating the fancy buildings will just create unemployed workers - and increase COGC costs.


[13-Feb-24 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The unemployment is already low its 5% for piooners and 20 % for settlers and technicians. And if u think only the profit is important i wont build other buildings but if run a planet in real life you would like them to have atlest something the population would enoy doing and have a better life.


[13-Feb-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Thats RP, right? Theres no actual benefit?


[13-Feb-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	But we can just install netflix and PRUN on the workers computers to keep the busy ;)


[13-Feb-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	We're kind of a rural farmer sorta planet tho


[13-Feb-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Unfortunately the game isn't really setup in a way that makes sense - or does but in a dystopian sense. Corporations elect governors. Not people.


[13-Feb-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So you as a governor serve the corporations - not people. The happiness of the workers is not a metric by which your leadership is measured in this universe.


[13-Feb-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you want to build shiny things and fill bars, go for it, I've done plenty of that. It's fun - but it's not the ideal approach and will just suck you dry


[13-Feb-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The only thing on Verdant that could use tech would be orchards ... and those are very few.  I don't know anyone who is going to retool to run techs.


[13-Feb-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Additionally ... I'd point out that if you _do_ want to support techs, make sure that you are taxing those product lines appropriate to the amount of support it takes to maintain the tech level POPI.


[13-Feb-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... I don't even have SET here though some HYF isn't unreasonable.  You're going to be spending a lot of popi upkeep to get techs up and planetwide, there might be... 30 orchards (they only use 10 techs) ... and take up space for 4x FRMs (1/2 of a 2nd or 3rd permit goes poof).


[13-Feb-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	8 weeks of tech immigration and they're still hardly being used.


[13-Feb-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The high water mark of techs on the planet was pop report 138 (October 25th) with 1550 and 38.2% unemployment ... 600 techs working so 60 orchards.


[13-Feb-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	might i ask why there is now a fee on the LM


[13-Feb-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	It's a small fee to keep the planet running if the planet infrastructere wont work at all the cost every week for governing is around 200000 NCC and the earnings for now is around 3000 NCC and if i dont make atleast some money i wont last more then 2 weeks as governor because of the costs.


[13-Feb-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	It takes time to attract bases and if u have available worker they will build and the more advanced workforce the more you earn money.


[13-Feb-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Both bases and the planet.


[13-Feb-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	in the past there has never been a fee


[13-Feb-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aside from from when there was a scammer thats only when a fee was put on


[13-Feb-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And maybe one day the planet will not be just for agriculture but for other industries to be diverse


[13-Feb-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	main industries you see here is farming and resurce extraction


[13-Feb-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	cost for the COGC is 210000 NCC in goods every 7 days that i have to supply


[13-Feb-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Other industries good be built to so the planet gets richer and not just farming and we would have money for more population infrastructre buildings


[13-Feb-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If you just supply the population with minimum they need to work you are exploiting them.


[13-Feb-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	depends on the persons playstyle


[13-Feb-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The planet would accomplish more.


[13-Feb-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	theres the thing of letting it happen naturally rather than forcing it


[13-Feb-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I agree it depends on the playstyle and if noone wants what i would like to do i wont do it.


[13-Feb-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I wont force it i will invest.


[13-Feb-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Time and NCC: I think  it would be fun atleast to try.


[13-Feb-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	even just asking the people to donate maybe like 10-20 of each thing on the cogc and it wouldnt take more than 130 people at most, obviously people can donate more if they wish


[13-Feb-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If they want to donate they can but i would like to accomplish to finace it with taxes that are not too high because the governors usually do that


[13-Feb-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	This is my first try as governor and i dont know how much finances i will earn from taxes on this fee rate but when i see i will plan next time better


[13-Feb-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And I'm not i scammer i want to play the game and build.


[13-Feb-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	thank u for the help in COGC i will last a bit longer as governor now


[13-Feb-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	in 2 hours i will send the ship wit the rest of the DW and rations.


[13-Feb-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	from Moria it will arrive in max day and a half


[13-Feb-24 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For Sand (1/4th the size & 30 / 40 / 200 for production, 25 and 2 for LM) I get about 250k / dividend period.  Sand has gone as far as owing me 1M NCC and I currently owe it 15k NCC I think (about where I want it).


[13-Feb-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Last cor dividend to me was 254,120 NCC.  Currently I owe Sand 15,078.


[13-Feb-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that it took two dividends to get everything paying to me rather than the previous gov.


[13-Feb-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The first one was 142,610 and the second was 218,650.


[13-Feb-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So you're not likely to see the changes in the numbers as a new gov for a week or two.


[13-Feb-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I will try to last as long as i can and the next time i will come prepared wit the building built in my base for everything i need and then how much money i earn will probably be enough to sustain everything i need.


[13-Feb-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	hopefully i will last longer then.


[13-Feb-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And some of my friends say that if u put work into something you shoul d atleast earn some money and not loose it.


[13-Feb-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I think planets with large populace should have buildings on them and running and not just work agriculture and have nothing else.


[13-Feb-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If i could earn 1M a month here i could pay for all the COGC supply the pop infrastractere and build more buildiings.


[13-Feb-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The planet runs COGC agri ... and that's done by a weighted vote.  That's not changing eaislly.


[13-Feb-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Trying to spin up smelting or chem or electronics here represents a sizeable opportunity cost for the person because its cheaper elsewhere, with aligned COGC, better resources and... well, whats the next closest agri world with more than 10 open plots?


[13-Feb-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(answer: Pyrgos CH-771a - northeast of BEN 8 jumps away from Verdant)


[13-Feb-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Verdant is perfect for agriculture. It has fertile soil and lots of water...


[13-Feb-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As gov, you can set the taxes and have the implied responsibility of using those taxes to maintain POPI and COGC.  Aside from setting unreasonable taxes on certain industries, the gov can't change the COGC by themselves (except on small planets with few others)


[13-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	can someone give me a brief explanation of what you guys have been talking about im curious but don't really understand it


[13-Feb-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	We have a new governor and discuss his plans for Verdant


[13-Feb-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Taxes (they show up as production fees), LM fees (previously 0), and plans ... and what the gov can _actually_ do.


[13-Feb-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	okay thank you


[13-Feb-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A better term than 'governor' is 'planetary accountant' because you get another set of spread sheets to manage and can't do _too_ much.


[13-Feb-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	the more i learn about the game the more i think i should start using spreedsheets


[13-Feb-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Heh... one planet, and Verdant... you can manage that with eyeballs.  You may not realize how much you spend in operational costs shipping to Moria ... but you can eyeball it.


[13-Feb-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Add PMMG and you can manage half a dozen planets without too much difficulty.

**Not_Trey**:	#1 lm should not have a fee the tax money is too little to matter


[13-Feb-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	unless you are charging over 1000 per add the money equates to less than a few thousand at most being set to 30


[13-Feb-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	#2 it costs 150k per week to run the cogc not 210k its on a 10 day timer not 7 days


[13-Feb-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	taxing tech is similar to lm fee its a drop in the water equates less than a few thousand a week


[13-Feb-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	pio is what you want to raise for more tax money


[13-Feb-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Warehouse and Lm should stay free as it encourages trade on verdant


[13-Feb-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The best way to make verdant "richer" as gov is to keep as much money in the peoples pockets as possible. They can then expand their farms and more exports and trade.


[13-Feb-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and not running buildings that take expensive resources to maintain upkeep for population that isn't getting used.


[13-Feb-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yep


[13-Feb-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Governor isn't so much "making executive decisions" but rather "keeper of a few more spreadsheets and making sure everything stays green."  CFO would be a better title.


[13-Feb-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	It would be cool if they added more to do as gov but I play it as get taxes as close to 0 mini game


[13-Feb-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Verdant is a very easy planet to make money as gov you can set the taxes to something slightly less than other major worlds and walk away with 1-2 mil a week


[13-Feb-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	right now i think you are right around 250k a week

**Not_Trey**:	The numbers i came up with are for every 1ncc tax on pio is about 20k 1ncc on set is about 1.5k and 1ncc on tech is .5. These are estimates so use them as such


[13-Feb-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	My fellow verdantians, to increase trade and the self sufficiency of our system what if we colonized yi-715E as a food processing plant. I will happily invest millions into this if you all think this may be a worthy project


[13-Feb-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider the cost of a FP there (AEF.NC1 availability vs MCG.NC1), the additional cost (INS.NC1 vs SEA.NC1), the additional damage to ships 'landing' on the planet (0.18% for Sand, 1.15% for YI-715e)


[13-Feb-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	What about cheap stl ships, that can transport large amounts of cargo cross system and have 1 stream of ships out to moria


[13-Feb-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PRO players only there.  Still a 500/500 unless you're going from a CQT.NC1 to a CQS.NC1 for a WCB.


[13-Feb-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(going from 500/500 to a WCB or MCB would almost double the price of an in system ship) ... and the fuel costs and transit times from Verdant to Sand and Verdant to YI-715e are almost the same.


[13-Feb-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and you're going to be doing repairs on the ship landing on YI-715e 10x more often than one hauling to Sand.


[13-Feb-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Well non pro players can dedicate their ships to moria verdant runs and pro players can transport large cargo cross system.


[13-Feb-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... except that you really don't want a WCB in system hauler unless you _REALLY_ want a WCB in system hauler.


[13-Feb-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The fuel you can technically make it a multi day trip to yi-715 to save money but idk if that part is worth. It may be offset with a wcb hauler


[13-Feb-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Check on the ship build for what you'd need in parts for a WCB in system hauler.


[13-Feb-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The big one is that it changes the ship crew quarters from a CQT (which is cheap) to a CQS (which isn't).


[13-Feb-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The saving probably are a drop in the pond


[13-Feb-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Buying an in system WCB will only cost you a few 100k _less_ than a FTL WCB ship.


[13-Feb-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I wonder which side really is the most cost efficient


[13-Feb-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(the few is about 1M all together looking at numbers) ... so 4.5M FTL vs 3.5M In system.


[13-Feb-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Vs 1.9M for in system 500/500 with FSE.


[13-Feb-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	then starter ships can constantly stream from verdant to moria rather than sand


[13-Feb-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Work out what the cost of a 20 FP base on Sand vs YI-715e would be.


[13-Feb-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yep doing it rn


[13-Feb-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Daily degregation for a FP on Sand is 117 NCC.


[13-Feb-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Really wish the new Gov had chosen a backwater planet to be Gov for the first time, instead of the breadbasket for MOR.


[13-Feb-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Base (including 2x FER and CM) is 892,708.00


[13-Feb-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Im re running sorry i abandond you guys last second, i worked out my irl issues and hopefully i can stay on consistently


[13-Feb-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Glad to hear your irl issues are worked out, I think we'd all welcome you back


[13-Feb-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Base cost for equivalent base 1,802,970.00


[13-Feb-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FP has 268 NCC daily degregation.


[13-Feb-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	A 715e base is 1.3 mil compared to 500k on sand


[13-Feb-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With CM, ROI for the base is 27 days (Sand is 11 days)


[13-Feb-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Slightly different bases we built .. did you include the CM?


[13-Feb-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	nope thats what i forgot


[13-Feb-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	700k with cm vs 1.5mil with cm


[13-Feb-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	No advantage in shipping time, 2x the repair cost for buildings, 10x the repair frequency for ships landing there...


[13-Feb-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	2 - 3x the cost of putting down the base depending on buildings.


[13-Feb-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	AEF.NC1 is better than it was... though its still $$.


[13-Feb-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(look at the 90 day price chart there)


[13-Feb-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Benefits are insystem wcbs cheaper they can land less because they transport more goods you can make the trip faster if you wanted to spend the money, and one stream of ftl ships out to moria


[13-Feb-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	look at 180 tho they just spiked for a time then went back down


[13-Feb-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm not sure about WCB in system ships and would spend the additional 20% on the cost of the ship to get a FTL WCB instead.


[13-Feb-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're trying to save money, its a 500/500 in system with a CQT.NC1 rather than CQS.NC1


[13-Feb-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yeah thats prob it


[13-Feb-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm using a 500/500 in XH-594 and that's hauling FE and STL.


[13-Feb-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(it also has a 4h flight time currently)


[13-Feb-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	you can get a faster flight to yi-715e than sand


[13-Feb-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	that costs a lot more fuel and may be irrelevant when you factor in the costs


[13-Feb-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is again a "run the numbers" ... and we're dealing with a ROI on YI-715e that is 2-3x longer than Sand.  What is the real cost of shipping from Verdant to e?


[13-Feb-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you get 2% damage with each landing/take off pair, in 10 trips, you're doing a hull plate fix up.


[13-Feb-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yeahh prob not worth


[13-Feb-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I _do_ want to do a vanity project some day of a gas world doing agri HYFs and have the hanging gardens of babaylon there.


[13-Feb-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... but that's a $$$ thing again for a vanity project... and I've got too many other practical projects where the lowest cost of ownership is the concern.


[13-Feb-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I would like to work with you more shagie as gov of sand. What if we kicked every tech and engi out of sand to lower taxes similar to verdant


[13-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	sand and verdant would control the food


[13-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider the workforce of BUI IVP


[13-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that's part of making MEA


[13-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ahhhhhhh yes


[13-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd have a riot if I tried to get rid of the techs.


[13-Feb-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	shagie would you be interested in taking verdant for a month keeping it stable and letting me have a crack at making sand cheaper


[13-Feb-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Enter the running in the next 4 days.  I'll even vote for you and if you win I'll transfer [SAND] to you to avoid any mess with taxes ... and its a nice corp ticker too.


[13-Feb-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	We got to make a joint corp and run verdant and sand as if they were one planet they go hand in hand


[13-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's a distinct possibility.  Verdant makes a bit more in taxes than Sand does... and Sand (as a faction planet) has some faction defined minimums (I can't set the LM fees any lower)


[13-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ahhhhhh i forgot about the damn faction minimums

[13-Feb-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	25/2 is the minimum for LM there.


[13-Feb-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I assume the same for the warehouses?


[13-Feb-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  LImited to 75 - 5000


[13-Feb-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Individual tax rates (I haven't tinkered with 'em) have a 5 min, and variable maxes.

[13-Feb-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright Ill do some research. The largest thorn is the tech


[13-Feb-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	They are really running those costs up


[13-Feb-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Thus the variable taxes and theirs being quite a bit higher.


[13-Feb-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	yeah they force the upkeep up. i wish we could focus needs on certain populations. The pios just sit there and need nothing but if you want tech all a suddenly they want more


[13-Feb-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	the problem is the popi is being spread out among the entire population not just tech


[13-Feb-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	How much are you spending currently on sand? Including the weekly programs.


[13-Feb-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright my plan is to cut the popi's let unemployment settle closer to its natural point see what the dynamics are and see if there are any interesting interactions between the pops like on verdant. if we get less people on sand we can turn the popi's back on at lower costs to bring back up the tech happiness while keeping other happiness low enough to not grow


[13-Feb-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ideally we get the cost per week down to 50-100k


[13-Feb-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	This is some intereresting stuff ^


[13-Feb-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While I'm probably not running it as efficently as I could, since taking office Sand has consumed 2,325,962 NCC.  The cost per day is 32,760 NCC.  The cost per week averages to 229,320 NCC.


[13-Feb-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The last 3 corp payouts have been 251k, 255k, and 254k.


[13-Feb-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	alright we can improve those numbers


[13-Feb-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	i can work with that


[13-Feb-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Invite me to the corp


[13-Feb-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	YI-715c would make a better FP planet then 715e would, its closer, its only INS and SEA (SEA being quite cheap) Curretnly has NO COGC so when one is added it can't be complained that it was stolen.


[13-Feb-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	oh that's promising, I also wouldn't mind the lithium or titanium lol


[14-Feb-24 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	It would be nice if the planet could build s market bank and stock exchange to produce money in the game maybe one day it will be implemented.


[14-Feb-24 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	A triad of systems Sand Verdant and Yi-715. We can focus heavier on tech on Sand and go only pios and setts on Yi-715c for really cheep planetary upkeep


[14-Feb-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Lets fix this governor mess first. i am swapping with shagie for a month or 2 to fix sand vote for him as next governor of verdant


[14-Feb-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u want u can run for governor in a week and a half since i dont have any more money to pay for the next this one will be filled and on the next one i will fail the earnings up till now is 15000 NCC and if i earn more from tax later i will help with COGC how much i get from the taxes without running population infrastructere its 210000 NCC per week.


[14-Feb-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dint know when i was running that most of the taxes will set in after 3 weeks.


[14-Feb-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I hope you didn't run thinking you'd make a profit...


[14-Feb-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And why are all the POPI turned off?


[14-Feb-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	They were turned off before i started and turned some on until i estimate the costs and the earnings on the planet but i have to wait for the next population report until they start working.


[14-Feb-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Uhm question: Why i cant see production of FRMs and INCs and see only RIG and COL in xit burn.


[14-Feb-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	On the planet or my base.


[14-Feb-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I have 2 inceneratiors and 15 farms just in my base.


[14-Feb-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And they are running.


[14-Feb-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u want to hear my plan for the planet it is for it to have a population of 350000 and the rest setlers technicians engineers and scientists. And to tax them acordingly and to run the popi infrastures at how much is need or a bit more if the finances suc


[14-Feb-24 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	* are enoough


[14-Feb-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I know more or less how to accomplish this an what i dont know i will learn from expirience.


[14-Feb-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The problem know is that i dint have enough money to pay for everything the planet needs and im only getting around 20000 NCC for now and i didnt know it will cost me that much the start because tihis is my first try as a governor.


[14-Feb-24 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Thing is that verdant is an exceptional at what it does - Theres not really a need to be a bustling city, that would just make us worse at what we are doing now.


[14-Feb-24 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Verdant is like the best Formula driver that you're trying to teach poetry to make him "better"


[14-Feb-24 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Its cool but beside the point :D


[14-Feb-24 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The planet be will be richer and contribute more to the empire as they are called here and big planets should not be just pionerres


[14-Feb-24 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And Verdant is a big planet.


[14-Feb-24 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it's a big farm


[14-Feb-24 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Its a bread basket and damn good at that.


[14-Feb-24 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Dont break it please


[14-Feb-24 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	O wont break it it will just earn more. And ill soon be leaving for the reasons i stated above and that is that im loosing a lot of money. But if u want me try for my plan i will come back as soon as i build enough buildings in my bases to finance the needs of the planet.


[14-Feb-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm definitely not voting for that. your company is old enough I expected that wouldn't be a problem when I saw you running, but at this point I think it would've been better if someone else did


[14-Feb-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u want me to try i will and i think 350000 pioneers for mostly agriculture and food producing is enough but if u think there are not enough planets with fertile soil for the empire to have food then i wont do it but when the terraforming gets in the game it will be diffrent


[14-Feb-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	how many bases do u have? that u can invest 210000 NCC every week.


[14-Feb-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im playing for quite some time now but its my first try at governor.


[14-Feb-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you can't pay 210k per week and want to expand and increase costs? I make more than that much in a day and that's mostly from Verdant and Sand alone


[14-Feb-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	this wasn't the planet to experiment with it on


[14-Feb-24 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	pick a different one


[14-Feb-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I wont experiment any longer i just wanted to try it to learn. and if u earn that much money that is great i still dont so ill come back later when i have more basses to pay for and that is the plan as i said before to build basse to be able to finnaces it but i had try atleast one time to learn.


[14-Feb-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Its difficult to learn without expierence.


[14-Feb-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There are no agri industry buildings that have scientists.  Running scientists for some industry will _always_ be cheaper somewhere else.


[14-Feb-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I can respect wanting to learn, so I won't knock you for that. but if I see you about to win by default again I'll put in my bid next time. I didn't do so this time because I was inexperienced


[14-Feb-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Same with engineers.  There is one with techs - orchards... but you don't need many of them at all (techs in an orchard, or orchards on a planet).


[14-Feb-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	O wont win by default because i won run until i build my basses.


[14-Feb-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	if the planet has just farms without education culture the population wont have a much of a life here


[14-Feb-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	U hove to treat the people on the planet atleast a bit well for the planet to function.


[14-Feb-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This isn't role playing ... this is economy ... and living in the rural areas, a lot of farms is a very nice life.


[14-Feb-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	they can move to another planet that is focused around that. in the meantime it's an honest living here and food is important for the whole galaxy


[14-Feb-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is Kanas ... and the closest agri world to Moria in Moria space.  The food for Vallis comes from here.


[14-Feb-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u want that its ok. I wont run then.


[14-Feb-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	if u have food on Vallis for know u wont loose anything in the future becase the intention is to have 350000 pioneers on the planet the rest will be settlers techs engineers and scientists.


[14-Feb-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Who is building buildings that need techs and scientists (and engineers) here?


[14-Feb-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	the food wont be produced less then it is now.

**shagie**:	I've got 995 of 1000 area (and 1500 PIO) dedicated to FRMs and RIGs.  I moved all my FP off word so I could have more FRMs because Moria keeps buying all the RAT I put on the market.


[14-Feb-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Who is building the buildings that use those worker tiers?


[14-Feb-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The planet will get richer with more advanced worker in some quantities.


[14-Feb-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you didn’t have any experience the first thing to do would have been to ask those more experienced with governing about what’s required.


[14-Feb-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Maybe more players will come in the game. And the quantity of food will not be less then it is now.Because i will try to attract more basses to use engineers and sientists.


[14-Feb-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And also to listen when we say why certain things work and others don’t


[14-Feb-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I agree but i had noone to as because i didnt know anyone whose governor.


[14-Feb-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What building uses ENG or SCI that someone would build here and would be cheaper to make here than somewhere else.


[14-Feb-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	why do u think it will not work.


[14-Feb-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	when u have the workforce someone will invest in building buildings.


[14-Feb-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Because building a CHP is cheaper on Circe (and shipping the DDT here).  Building a SME is cheaper on Kiruna (and shipping the FE around).


[14-Feb-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Even if the workers _were_ here to use... it would still be cheaper to do those things on other planets.


[14-Feb-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	specialization is a good thing. we're specialized for agriculture


[14-Feb-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	What do you guys would be a good planet to add to the system? I've been thinking that theres this import deficit to the system, something like Manu(Making all the basic consumables in the same system? a dream <3)


[14-Feb-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	because there are no Agri building which uses engi and scientist.


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Construction would have the benefit of some LST and FE thats around


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The planet doesnt have to be just aggri all of it.


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And its _WAY_ more expensive to make agri elsewhere else near Moria.


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	why not? that's what our planet is best for


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd suggest doing a random sampling of the sites.


[14-Feb-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pull up YI-715b and click on a blue plot.


[14-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Tell me how many you have to click on before you get something that doesn't say "Agriculture"


[14-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Verdant is 4th fertile planet in the game planets.


[14-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I know the resources here because i have a bes here


[14-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Well we’re sharing our views about what’s best to run the planet now that you’re asking, so no need to find us


[14-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	* base


[14-Feb-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And what we’re saying is, focus on keeping the Agri strong.


[14-Feb-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm also going to point out that Verdant is the only agri world with more than 10 open plots in the core ring.


[14-Feb-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Techs and engis can go almost on any planet, our poor farmers can only live here


[14-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	sci and engi^*


[14-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Agri will stay stron it will just have a little bit of other things not jus agriculture.


[14-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What other things?


[14-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What building do you suggest building that uses eng or sci that you would build here, on Verdant, yourself?


[14-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	The other things are not profitable without gogc, I dont think theres anything that really makes sense to build here


[14-Feb-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	What they build and what they want to produce u can make ship parts here or other a bit more expensive stuf f and on the Moria theres barley any selling.


[14-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	of the more expensive stuff.


[14-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	well we're here and we want to grow plants


[14-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ok I’m done here. Over to you more patient people :)


[14-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you done the prun planner for what it would take to build s ship kit factory here?


[14-Feb-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And how much it would cost here rather than say on Danakil (I think that's the preferred one in the area)?


[14-Feb-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What would the cost be for putting a CHP and LAB here rather than on Circe?  The CHP is even more productive over on YI-705c - since that resolves a lot of logistics issues.


[14-Feb-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Back just for this part - SKF is metallurgy so Vallis is better


[14-Feb-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Or Kiruna


[14-Feb-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dont know yet but if u want me to make a plan i will my base here is mostly farming and food processing but if u want me i can advise what to build and if u want to build ships u will need parts and some of the parts are sometimes not available or produced in small quantites and i will nit change anything that is built now i just want to planet to have a bit more.


[14-Feb-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Why would you advise someone to run a base that is less than optimal agri here (and makes less profit than the same industries on a different planet that have aligned COGC and resources)?


[14-Feb-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im trying to build a planet thats nicer for people to live on not just esrn money.


[14-Feb-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	pls keep the planet as agri world not forge world. i came here to grow farms.


[14-Feb-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I want a galaxy that's good to live in, not just the planet


[14-Feb-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	for that we ought to optimize our decision making. if you want ship parts to be available in greater quantities then go to a world that's good for that and produce them


[14-Feb-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Most of it will still be agri nothing will change it will just be added the plann is for aggri ther will be an even more populace not less


[14-Feb-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	The agri sector would have to pay for the non-profitable forge sector


[14-Feb-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	The upkeep would be huge compared to any benefit


[14-Feb-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	It would be bigger taxes for RP


[14-Feb-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dont know everythig about the systems but most of the materials on more advanced Building have to be shipped anyway.


[14-Feb-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Maybe they maybe they wont but taxes are raise on richer planets because the earn more money for the basse if they dont earn money mor they wont be taxed more and their income according to taxes will just incresa because i think that are the rules of taxing.


[14-Feb-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u dont earn more u wont be taxed more and if u earn more u have more profti according the rules of taxing


[14-Feb-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm still curious what non-agri building you'd build here would be cheaper than somewhere else.


[14-Feb-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Its not just important to be cheaper the for some thing scients and enginner make is on the market and why they are not producing more of it then why are there not more of them on Moria there are some ship kits there but not in large quantities and as i said most aof the materials is shipped on otreh planets aswell


[14-Feb-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	where is the industry for ships in large quantities located around moria that u know


[14-Feb-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	can we protest like europes farmer protests tractors to close roads. lol


[14-Feb-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And if u earn that much money as the previous person say u have money for fues


[14-Feb-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	fuel


[14-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For Sand, if someone wants more techs (and they have in the past), they contact the gov and the levels have been adjusted to encourage more.  No one has ever asked me for more engineers or scientists there.


[14-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Until there are buildings that need them, its better to not have them ... and if someone _does_ want them, they ask.


[14-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Has anyone built a building and asked for tech or sci tier workers?


[14-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If theres no workforce noone will build buildings


[14-Feb-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	"build it and they will come" - it doesn't work


[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You could have 1000 engineers, and you'd have 100% unemployment for them.  There is no reason to build an engineer workforce building here.


[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	At start maybe not but if tryed it may succed and noone we loose profit from it


[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I wouldnt really build anything requiring the higher pops - Costs for buildings are huge, ROI's vary, and if im spending 500-1000k to build a building I want it to run at 25% extra effiency from gocg


[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Only hightech building we should have here is orc and even those should be banned IMO


[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But my booze...


[14-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dont nedd 1000 enginers imidietly produce 100 and someone may build buildings and the u produce more and then it will work


[14-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Call it the temperance movement


[14-Feb-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What building would you suggest placing here that needs an engineer workforce?


[14-Feb-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If u do what u do here to just want profit and give nothing to those that work u will have a rebelion in a year and no other spacerfaring civilization will have a positive opinion on you.


[14-Feb-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	a rebellion? buddy, I give my workers padded overalls and coffee. they're plenty happy


[14-Feb-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll worry about rebellions when the devs implement it.


[14-Feb-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	My workers always have the option to go work in an identical workplace on the same planet, so why rebel? They got a choice


[14-Feb-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	They even get to taste some of the coffee they make sometimes


[14-Feb-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Here there is no education culture the health is 25 % max i dont think their very happie with that and if i want to finances better condisitons for them i eitrer need to tax more pionners or get and advanced workforce to pay a bit more taxes.


[14-Feb-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	I think theres a flaw in there


[14-Feb-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	i Drink coffe 5 times a day when i work and i would like to have atleast some more of live like anyone else and not just work like they do here


[14-Feb-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i think u are mixing that the taxes. taxes are u collect from us.


[14-Feb-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Good philosophical question there : Is it right to give the workers any coffee? Is it not cruel to let them have a taste of better things when they cannot enjoy it reguraly?


[14-Feb-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	not we take from our farmers.


[14-Feb-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Would it be better if they never tasted it and knew to miss it?


[14-Feb-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	ignorance is bless.


[14-Feb-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Would you like to live like this and never go to school or have nothing tod but work all day.


[14-Feb-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	^we always have prun


[14-Feb-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	wait what?


[14-Feb-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	To an extent, remember that this is a shared spread sheet and a game.  The proposal to have more engineers and scientists here make some cells in other people's spreadsheets go read and are a bit concerning to them. These are spreadsheets and numbers - not real people.


[14-Feb-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As a governor, your ability to do more than change a few numbers is limited.  Most govs don't even have the largest vote on COGC - which is where the real influence for how a planet is run is done.


[14-Feb-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Will u who wiold like to be governers here what to finence population infrastrutres?


[14-Feb-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I wont change the COGC i just want atlest of other things on the planet not just agriculture and base buildings


[14-Feb-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I know how to do what u want as governor to just produce food but i would like for the planet to be richer and have culture and education running.


[14-Feb-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I have to go i have guests ariving.


[14-Feb-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	I am very confused


[14-Feb-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	if you want to roleplay, thats fine by, have fun, but dont do it on planet that you will be the only one doing it


[14-Feb-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	fine by me*


[14-Feb-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	but the only thing you will achieve is messing with the population, infrastructure and adding unnecessary expenses to the planet


[14-Feb-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	and unless you are the governor forever, it will be useless as any other subsequent governor will undo this


[14-Feb-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	you will also ruin the effort that Not_Trey made to balance the population, taxes and infrastructure of the planet


[14-Feb-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wereii**:	^


[14-Feb-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im not roleplaying and as i said if you want to do the things you do here in space one day then you should do the the right way and like i said the planet if goes as planned will still produce a lot of food.


[14-Feb-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	this is not a simulator for eventually colonizing space lmao


[14-Feb-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(aside: Terraformers on Steam is a good game)


[14-Feb-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	oooooooooo ok noted


[14-Feb-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Surviving Mars too.


[14-Feb-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Then what is it then a simulation of colonizing planets.


[14-Feb-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A shared spreadsheet with an economics sumulation running behind it.


[14-Feb-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	^


[14-Feb-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Its not economics but a space simulation.


[14-Feb-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	You colonize and build bases in space in the game.


[14-Feb-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	What will u do if u are governor what will u invest the money the planet makes in the planet itself.


[14-Feb-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	it is a economics simulation


[14-Feb-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	the space simulation is the very minor part of it


[14-Feb-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	and what do you mean you are no roleplaying? then why do you want to give education to number on a screen?


[14-Feb-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	are not*


[14-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	like i siad if u intend to run things this way one day in space you will probbably loose everything and there will be riots all over space


[14-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've joked that you could retheme it to fantasy with trade routes and wouldn't have trouble until someone tried selling a FTL engine (rather than a Flying Carpet) to an elf in universe chat.


[14-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	so you are roleplaying


[14-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	a possible future


[14-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	this isnt a space colonasing gage


[14-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	game*


[14-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	its a space economy game


[14-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	the workers cant rebel


[14-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I dont know why u said just that butt if u want a thriving space faring civilization you will need ships.


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	and i at least never saw one the devs mentioning anything about making it a feature in the future


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	for now but as i said if u do things this way one day in space it will not last long.


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	ok


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	and as i said


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	go roleplay in another planet


[14-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	withou bothering people who dont want it


[14-Feb-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	this not a civilisation/colonisation game. this game is pure economics. if u want to role play it go play dwarf fortress. aurora / quasar 4x


[14-Feb-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	its not roleplaying and if are interest in the game just to earn some NCC that u can t spen anywere why are u playing the game


[14-Feb-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	i didnt see a single person agreeing with what you said and you want to force it because you want to roleplay


[14-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	im not rolepaying to take care of workers


[14-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	im roleplaying to gain fake money

**SmilingProphet**:	what else are u doing here


[14-Feb-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	a infinite loop of gaining fake money to expand my bases to gain more fake money


[14-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Why are u doing that dont u have anything better to do then just earn meaningless fake money


[14-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	if you want to make a dream planet for workers, do it in another planet where the pleople there doest care about it


[14-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	or even better


[14-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	do it on a empty planet


[14-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	No i dont, if i had something better i wouldnt be playing


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	the planet will produce more money the economy will be better and everyone will earn more money


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	I personally find spreadsheets quite enjoyable


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the planet won't produce more money, that's the thing


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	dude


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	making the population happier does nothing useful

**dakota1234**:	source??


[14-Feb-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	because of the infrastructure upkeep


[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	the higher the tiers of workers


[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	the higher will be upkeep


[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	the more money u get from the workforce

[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Thats more advenced


[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	that's not how it works


[14-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	no one will use the more advanced workers


[14-Feb-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	then how does it work when half of bigger planets in the area are doing that


[14-Feb-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	there not a single feature in the game that you can sell anything to the workers


[14-Feb-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	there not a single planet getting higher tiers worker that they dont need


[14-Feb-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Wha would theay use workers that are available for producing if they are ther


[14-Feb-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	wdym dude?


[14-Feb-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	at this point you are just forcing your point


[14-Feb-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	you didnt give a single good reason for it


[14-Feb-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If make then someone will invest in the bases on the planet and if want a planet in the game that has 500000 pioneers jus producing food and nothig else then something is not right


[14-Feb-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im giving arguments not forcing


[14-Feb-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	this istn like real life that the more workers mean a higher economic force


[14-Feb-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	this game doesnt give salary to the workers


[14-Feb-24 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	They dont give salary to the they get food and building to run they should atleast have something for their work


[14-Feb-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i cant make my mind is he trolling or roleplaying or simply dont understand the game mechanics?


[14-Feb-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	i think its all of them

[14-Feb-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	i undestand the game mechanics and the planet will gwt richer if it goes according to plan


[14-Feb-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... that's where I think everyone is saying "it doesn't need to be richer, and you're going to actually make it poorer trying to support engineer and scientists on the planet that will be 100% unemployed."


[14-Feb-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Whats the point in writing lore if you dont learn something atleast usefuell from the gaem


[14-Feb-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	it will not go according the plan. we all trying to tell you that.


[14-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	It wont get worce there will be just 100 engineers and 100 scientis in the beggining and thea will go away if thea pull them with immigration and the u will once again have what u have noe


[14-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What buildings are you planning on building that use engineers and scientists?


[14-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	then go do all that in your planet in YI-715e


[14-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I wont be building the base owners will if they think they profit and they probbaly will


[14-Feb-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The more u invest in the planet the better it runs and more money it makes


[14-Feb-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i cannnot be profitted what i ll not build.


[14-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't know of anyone saying they want anything other than agri on the planet... no one has ever voted a different COGC in a LONG LONG time.


[14-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Hello everyone, I read through some of the chat with our new gov at Verdant. To be honest I wonder what can go wrong in the short term. The CoGC is voted not decided by a gov. Pioneers and Settlers stay stable without popi supply. I mean what can go wrong?


[14-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Your taxes and fees can go up to unproductive things.


[14-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(btw, Sand is cheaper for posting LM ads from Verdant to Sand now - I can't lower tham any more since its a faction world)


[14-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	That is true but 10 / 20 / 25 is not a catastrophe, right?


[14-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	the cogc will stay the same but there will be other industries if u wand the whole Verdant jus producing agriculture then it will not do well


[14-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	nobody will change from agri. That is an illusion.


[14-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Why would someone want to build manufacturing or metallrugy or construction on a planet that doesn't align with the COGC?


[14-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	if we divert resources away from agri here then it will reduce the overall prosperity of the galaxy via reduction in food supply relative to other industries. the proposed moves here will only ever accomplish the opposite


[14-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	more worker which i dont usejust sitting and eating and keeping them happy= more taxes


[14-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	atleast 350000 are planned for things needed in food production


[14-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	a gov does not have any power to decide that anyone should do anything else than agri here...


[14-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If i build may basse as planed it will produce most thing need for the cogc next time i run and thats the biggest cost on the planet now


[14-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you voted for something different in COGC?


[14-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes and the CoGC will still support agriculture if our gov supplies it.


[14-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's 20,000 PIO represented in bases voting for agri ... and none for anything else.


[14-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	the whole planet doesnt need just farm on them if u want to build ajust aggriculrure


[14-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm building more farms on other worlds because I can't build enough farms here.


[14-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm debating switching some of my farms to HYF so that I can do _more farming_.


[14-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT prices in Moria are the highest of anywhere in the core.


[14-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	IF u dont want anything else i wont run the next time but the planet will just probbably get poorer then other planets if u want that i wont run next time


[14-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	and i have two farm planet to able supply only sand.


[14-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	there won't be other planets that become rich without food


[14-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	don't miss the forest for the trees


[14-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Is sand a planet or your company and if u need two planets for that its probbably a planet


[14-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	If I skip the illusion and look on the facts, all results of this chat is that even more people used their influence to vote for the next agriculture campaign at the CoGC.


[14-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	So u want all other planets two be rich from the thing we produce and we get nothing and have a populace that barely get anything


[14-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sand is the food processing world that I current administer the finances for that is mdiway between Verdant and Moria.


[14-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The cogc in ment to decide the dominant industry on the planet and not everything


[14-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	i wont run next time


[14-Feb-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I am a governor at Sabaton, an uninhabitable planet. If you want to learn from me then learn the following: Everything is an illusion as long as it is not happening at the bases too and the bases are controlled by all the players not the governor.


[14-Feb-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, I've looked there... TO-392d is interesting.


[14-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You might see my name in site owners there some day.


[14-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	i wont control anything they will build what tgey want with the workforce it gets


[14-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You are welcome.


[14-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	Smiling, it sounds as if you're trying to intuite purpose where none was meant (ie workers get nothing but room and board). You are accurate in that, but this is a game in early development, and while factors may be added in the future, it's important to remember that not all economic factors/pressures are anticipated, nor potentially meant to be.


[14-Feb-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	@molab I'm going to be landing a base there tomorrow :)


[14-Feb-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	Im building my bases anywere i can to produce what i can. and i wont run next time who h


[14-Feb-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	?who gets the governorship gets and we will see what happens i lost too mush money already


[14-Feb-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You got pm, Turin.


[14-Feb-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turin**:	That's pretty much the point, build where you want and make what you want


[14-Feb-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	What do you spend money for? You should earn about 170k NCC per week from pioneers alone.


[14-Feb-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	The CoGC costs about 153k per week calculated with CX sell prices.

***MacChez** joined.*


[14-Feb-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	SmilingProphet is it a problem that you will get the next tax payment in about 2-3 days and the supplies of DW and RAT for about 170k NCC need to be done at the CoGC?


[14-Feb-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Ah I see, you are doing your job. Good work Smiling!


[14-Feb-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Not_Trey**:	Alright


[14-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	@MacChez The only limitation for a free player in early game is not being able to trade on local market, other things won't bother you until like several months into


[14-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And local markets are also not a necessety, although very convenient (probably)


[14-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Look at me here, a couple of month in, still on free, doing well


[14-Feb-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Heres whats up, Governors goals should be to keep more money in the peoples pockets. Its not the governments job to decide how I will spend my money.


[14-Feb-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Uh oh, ancaps in the chat! :D


[14-Feb-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Im too invested into the politics of this game guys


[14-Feb-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	@SmilingProphet Lower the planetary tax to 0 any money you have spent already on the planet i will pay you back for. I will continue to keep supplying the cogc. Lower the market back to 0.


[14-Feb-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Tell me how much you got from taxes so far and what you ahve payed for the current cogc ill pay the difference


[14-Feb-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The money i earn after i fail next week and somone takes over i will contribute to the COGC


[14-Feb-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Lower the taxes to 0


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	@Not_Trey you seem very obsessed with 0 tax :)


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It was the first planet for me that had it


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I am thats what i ran on was keeping verdant at something less than 5


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I payed around 190000 NCC foe the COGC and got  20000 NCC from now and some small amount from transport fees


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Lower the tax to 0 right now and i will pay you 170k for your troubles


[14-Feb-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	And market tax to 0


[14-Feb-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I will set the taxes to 0 NAd what will happen later i dont now but if u want thjat i will and u dont have to pay me.


[14-Feb-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I will supply the cogc moving forward


[14-Feb-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	The taxes are set to 0.


[14-Feb-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	i probably wont get any money more.


[14-Feb-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I sent you the 170k contract


[14-Feb-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	If i run in the future i will come prepared but i will probbably not run anymore i just wanted to try as governor


[14-Feb-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	u hoeldnt send me money because those are my losses not yours part of the risk


[14-Feb-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I sent it back


[14-Feb-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	my risk my cash those are rhe rules


[14-Feb-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright Respectable, We can get you started on a planet like Yi-715C if we get it kicked off as a cheap alternative to Sand


[14-Feb-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	What happens hapens we will see but i need to now the expenses ther i wont risk one more time


[14-Feb-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Try to start as unexperienced gov on a planet that is of lower relevance.


[14-Feb-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Verdant has a key role


[14-Feb-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I know how to govern the planet i just didnt knoe the taxes come more after the first 3 weeks as they say and i estinated that the current fees would be enough for i had to pay


[14-Feb-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright just for everyone, my first planet as gov was of verdant. I spent too much time researching the gov and pop mechanics. You don't need to start on a planet of lower relevance you need to understand the insane pop mechanics and even the people on the planets and their unique wants and needs.


[14-Feb-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I agree if u know alot you should govern when i know more  I will candidate again.


[14-Feb-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	And if u understand everything u say you will be a good governor.


[14-Feb-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmilingProphet**:	I will research more on the internet too my biggest mistake was to try and dont have enough funds to pay for everything i need and i know the basics of the mechanics


[14-Feb-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I was governor but I dropped out because I had an issue that I worried might draw me away from the game for an extended time, thankfully that didnt happen.

**SmilingProphet**:	If u comeback come back see ya


[14-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	MORE Governance corp will run this sector of the galaxy for the time being. We plan on running Sand and Verdant with the goal of minimizing taxes for pios and sets. We want to make sure verdant is dedicated to farming, Sand dedicated to tech food processing and eventually YI-715C as a pio and set food processing planet.

[14-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Also to make it clear on Verdant, we will not out right ban tech but if you wish to grow tech it will come out of techs pockets because its exponential growth of planetary upkeep if we wish to harbor tech elitists.


[14-Feb-24 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MacChez**:	Not_Trey are you part of a faction with a discord? if so I'd like to join


[14-Feb-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	There's 4000 dead rocks to do industry on. There's 24 fertile planets to farm on. We're not tearing up our cornfields because factories are sexier. Everyone's workforce has to eat food and this is one of the few spots you can grow it. We're specialized for agriculture, don't rock the boat. >_>


[14-Feb-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There are 2 good agri worlds in the core sectors - Promitor and Verdant.  Proxion is a tad bit dry (this can be mitigated but a "realize that its dry") and Harmonia is... not as good as the other three.


[14-Feb-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	After that, you start looking at Pyrgos (CH-771a) which is quite nice, just if people think Verdant is distant... that's another 8 jumps out... and Nemesis (JS-299a) - not bad, just also further out.


[14-Feb-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Of the Big Three ag worlds that are better than here, two are out in the boonies and one is full.


[14-Feb-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then you're going to "maybe I should join GTU and help out at Kinza (LG-418b) and "you know, maybe having a positive fertility isn't such a big deal anyways...Lemuria (AJ-768a) isn't _that_ bad... is it?


[14-Feb-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	And then you've got Saladin (PG-899b) ...I wonder if they put the best agriworld out at the ass end of the universe as a joke. If you think Verdant or Pyrgos are far out, Saladin is so far away a starter ship has to stop and refuel twice—going one way. The only people who set up shop out there are the hermits.


[14-Feb-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GM-223 is named as such because they needed a planet with a warehouse in order to boostrap CI2.  And HM-223b has a do nothing gov... 0 population too.


[14-Feb-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ack, that first one should he HM-223 not GM.


[14-Feb-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Then you have the sad case of QF-930b which is fertile but is *really* way out away from anything anywhere that's remotely useful. Only one person ever went there and they don't play anymore.


[14-Feb-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	-6.0% fertility there.  Not great.


[14-Feb-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Southern tip of the southern arm off of IC.


[14-Feb-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Ten are worse.


[14-Feb-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Looking around QF ... it might be kind of ok if IC had set up IC2 out there... there are some rich worlds... but nothing that would make a Promitor farmer eager to head out there.


[14-Feb-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you see four and 5 resource worlds... that's a bootstrap system.  QF-497


[14-Feb-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	HM-910c...another fertile world hosed by its location. It's overshadowed by Poseidon (HM-049b) which is slightly more fertile and you have to go past it to get there.


[14-Feb-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that this is listing off _all_ of the fertile worlds ... not suggesting farms on Etherwind or Montem though.  But good fertility is a _very_ rare resource in the 'verse.


[14-Feb-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Alright for all aspiring politicians with the new politics update around the corner i would like to build up a party of in game libertarians who want to help out with ensuring planets are at minimal taxes and running as efficiently as possible with minimal gov interference


[14-Feb-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Few things to keep in mind, we are not going to make any profits off of taxes on planets. We build our bases to be self sufficient and produce every planetary upkeep. Imagine us as the government making money from state owned farms and not taxing and reinvesting those crops into the people.


[14-Feb-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Any politicians interested contact me we want to shoot for every starter planet at minimal taxes.


[14-Feb-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm of the belief the governor shouldn't run the planet at bare minimum or out of their pocket, while it is nice when they do that, it doesn't easily allow for newer governors


[15-Feb-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But alas, it seems my propaganda wars in the future will extend past just Avalon and Promitor :}


[15-Feb-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Well i do kind of agree but its so much better if players specialize in the planetary upkeep to be governor


[15-Feb-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Even if you specialize in the planetary upkeep, it's still more or less coming out of your pocket

[15-Feb-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Please make sure we are building huge farms on verdant guys to ensure the agri production is maxed out. Its rare for a planet like verdant to exist in the galaxy so its crucial we use it to its maximum. I recommend for food processors you move to SAND (WB-675b) and eventually YI-715c


[15-Feb-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	Why is YI-715c preferable to SAND?


[15-Feb-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't believe that YI-715c is more cost effective than WB-675c - especially when things like "shipping H2O and ALG from Bastion system".  Also I'll note that adding INS for building costs is expensive.


[15-Feb-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The ROI on being able to do in system shipping for Verdant (Sand is 153 SF + 49 FF vs 153 SF -- you're saving 686 NCC per shipment) compared to the additional cost of INS and additional shipping from Frost (if there - I ship ~500 H2O / day from there to Sand) ... I don't see it.


[15-Feb-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The additional INS cost adds another 100 NCC / FP / day (222 NCC vs 120 NCC) ... and I have 20 FPs running on Sand now ... that would represent an additional 2000 NCC cost per day for building repairs to save 600 cost per shipment.


[15-Feb-24 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm also going to point out that the one current inhabitant of YI-715c has a Metallurgy base... ( PPI 69bdd2cb ) and might have some comments about the desired base.  YI-715c is the third best TIO resource in the universe ... and running FP COGC rather than Metallurgy or resource extraction might be seen as wasteful.


[15-Feb-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	The main purposes of YI-715c is to provide a fp planet dedicated to pios and setts to have similar taxes to verdant. Sand i do plan on keeping tech which is very costly but important for the economy


[15-Feb-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're spending 2x more per building repair which is 10x more than production fees that Sand has at minimum.


[15-Feb-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The reason that people didn't build on YI-715c when Midway was founded was because the math didn't work out then... it still doesn't work out favorably.


[15-Feb-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Ahh alright


[15-Feb-24 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Maybe we just build it up as a tio mining planet


[15-Feb-24 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	It might work out if you flipped the plan for pio vs tech - since a people running techs are more likely to be willing or interested in eating the higher up front cost


[15-Feb-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Yeah i already got a plan for the tech


[15-Feb-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	it should be fine


[15-Feb-24 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and why do you want to run FP on one of the best TIO worlds in the universe?


[15-Feb-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	Its close to verdant and i was just brainstorming options


[15-Feb-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_Trey**:	I pretty much tell yall any ideas (good or bad) i have currently


[15-Feb-24 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	that's kind of the thing with FP planets - you squeeze them in on convenient planets that don't seem to be used for something else


[15-Feb-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	like Pallada is currently an FP planet - mainly because no one else in that system was doing anything with it


[15-Feb-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's a DW factory for Moria that is associated with XH-083c.


[15-Feb-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Not quite as popular / viable as Frost / Sand ... but XH-083c has more water than Frost, but comes with needing HSE and so its a bit more awkward to colonize.


[15-Feb-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	if you guys a looking for a nearby planet to make tech food bases it may be worth to look into YI-683e

**shagie**:	For verdant, make sure that you're loading up with enough stuff to ship before you ship - its a long trip to Moria and you don't want to spend fuel you don't need to (make sure that when shipping always set the reactor slider to the far left)

[20-Feb-24 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Avalon has tempted me... but for a permit and really needing two (Boucher and Avalon to make it really worth while) ... it hasn't been _too_ tempting.


[20-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As to Sand, its not so much a "we" need to decide on another but rather "the economics of another food processing planet further out on the eastern Moria loop hasn't shown itself to be better.


[20-Feb-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	For low hauling stuff Avalon works ok.  I'm there for KOM, so hauling is easy.  That being said, I'm knocking back my KOM, so Avalon will probably be axed soon as there are so many closer FP planets and I don't need the HQ anymore


[20-Feb-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The odd bit for me with IC space... if I _did_ get into there, I'd be building on OZ ... which is a chem system ... which gets the outer reaches / no faction bonus... which means that Verdant is the best place for that with chem, resource, and fuel bonuses.

**banuka**:	thing i'm pondering is few farms can support a lot of FPs. so if i scale up here and then want to move all FPs to Sand that's gonna be expensive task. so wondering if it make sense to do it now (as in start the FP base in sand now)


[21-Feb-24 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	that way i'm adding more jumps to workflow. so initially would be costly


[21-Feb-24 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	Maybe selling farm produce on Moria makes sense too? Well it seems to be profitable, just that the volumes are not as high as with consumables.


[21-Feb-24 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	I wonder if it is bought by victuallers from Moria or systems nearby


[21-Feb-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant to Moria is the about same distance as Promitor to Moria.


[21-Feb-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm sure that some ship to MOR rather than HRT.


[21-Feb-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With raw agri products, its fairly easy to crash the market - and they're heavier to ship.


[21-Feb-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can move 500 GRN.NC1 in a starter ship.  You can ship 2380 RAT in the same ship.


[21-Feb-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If agri products have 100 NCC profit per unit, that's 50,000 (assuming you sell it all).  Lets put each unit of RAT at 65 profit per unit... that's about 150,000 profit on a shipment.  That represents less operational costs too (fuel).


[21-Feb-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that GRN and crashing the market - 490 units were traded in MOR today.  None has been traded in CI1.  363 units in AI1.  1472 units in IC1.


[21-Feb-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Another way to look at it... XIT fin_production (with PMMG extended installed)


[21-Feb-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant (for me) produces 103k and consumes 32k (at 70k profit)


[21-Feb-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sand (and I'm still scaling up) consumes 148k ... and produces 250k for 102k profit.

[21-Feb-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	its because GRN can be used to make C


[21-Feb-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	IVP employs tech and needs rfabs to be built


[21-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Selling GRN - you're looking at ~250 units per day sold in NC1.  One starter ship would have a 2 days supply of goods.. and you'd be selling to lowstrife.


[21-Feb-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You also get to a "one starter ship with 500 GRN (and 250 BEA and NUT.NC1 or VEG.NC1 back) is a lot of shipping low value goods.

**Haworthia**:	I wonder if it would be more profittable to buy HER at this point. Sure, one DDT will still bring you a ~100% profit if you sell HER, but then it will also keep your Farm busy for a whole day..


[24-Feb-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Haworthia**:	okay, checked it in prunplanner and it looks like HER is still extremely profitable lol

[24-Feb-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I started making HER and FIM back in August / September... and then the price went up... and that's when I started planning on some chem.


[24-Feb-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Though even in October, it was profitable (FIM was a bit more too - you can see the jump in FIM.NC1 too - not quite as much margin, but still profitable.


[24-Feb-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I wonder what the price looked like even before that


[24-Feb-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

Bullwhip effect
The bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon where orders to suppliers tend to have a larger variability than sales to buyers, which results in an amplified demand variability upstream. In part, this results in increasing swings in inventory in response to shifts in consumer demand as one moves further up the supply chain. The concept first ...

**shagie**:	This is from Prun Planner market reserach.


[24-Feb-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The price for DDT in June to August was a fairly consistent 2k - 2.5k NCC.


[24-Feb-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Mid August it shot up to 4k and has been bouncing around in the 3k to 4k range since.


[24-Feb-24 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	What's a reasonable price for it?


[27-Feb-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	56 @ 4000 in DDT.NC1


[27-Feb-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're willing to pick it up in Circe now, I can sell you another 36.


[27-Feb-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	I've got a month's supply and hopefully by then I'll never need to buy more again.


[27-Feb-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Well, I did have it up there... and it sold out.


[27-Feb-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	I'm planning on setting up bases on Umbra and Circe; get my H from Umbra, make the CL on Circe, then ship them back and forth so I can make DDT in both locations. I'll just have to buy carbon until I get that production chain set up.


[27-Feb-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	First things first, though, ship upgrades. I've got the parts and they're on the way to the shipyards.


[27-Feb-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm definitely going the "buy H" route, but I've got production of the other stuff already taken care of. I just need to get an extra permit and plop my second chemical base down- or expand Circe, but I'm reluctant to do that


[27-Feb-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One option is YI-705c where you can get HAL (and/or CL) which you could ship to Circe, freeing up EXT space on Circe for LABs.


[27-Feb-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	YI-705c is 11 HAL every 11h 34m compared to Circe with 7 HAL every 11h 53m.


[27-Feb-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Perhaps later. Main concern is getting the foundations of the supply chain up and running before my supply runs out. I can always expand later.


[27-Feb-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm currently in the process of moving EXT, CHP (HAL -> NA+CL) and some spare space for POL to 705c and CHP(FLX, NAB) and LAB, and POL (EPO only) to Circe.

[27-Feb-24 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I was this close to setting up on Umbra


[27-Feb-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its cold, but you can create a lot of the first tiers (POI + SET) chem products there and then ship them to Circe as part of the "moving stuff from YI t'wards Moria"

**Iscorta**:	how would i go about starting up ddt production and where would a good plant be for it


[27-Feb-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Circe is where you'd start.  You'd need EXT, CHP, and a LAB.


[27-Feb-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	EXT -> HAL -> CHP (HAL + H2O) -> CL (+NA) -> LAB (C H CL) -> DDT


[27-Feb-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The awkward part for this is the "ug, need to build a lab" - they aren't cheap.


[27-Feb-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're over producing CL, build a POL which can do C + H + CL + O -> EPO which is a nice cash sell.


[27-Feb-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	@Iscorta you're probably better off making it a long term plan unless you can get a sizeable cash infusion somehow


[27-Feb-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I have more disposable income than I've ever had and I'm popping out bases left and right and it's still expensive for me

[02-Mar-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Looking for load: 600 t / 1300 m3, route MOR >> Verdant. 10 NCC for higher value.


[02-Mar-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There ... two little ones.  Not much mass overall, but still would be useful to get this way.


[02-Mar-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I went over to my "need to do stuff" xit repairs screen and saw "Verdant" all over it.


[02-Mar-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**foxogan**:	WizBolt - yes and no. travel costs would be higher but planets further away can provide more opportunities to make more money, so it evens out if you prepare for it


[09-Mar-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Promitor (the agri world of HRT) is in the same system as HRT itself - and that is quite convenient for those who start there.


[09-Mar-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The longer distance is a slight logistical complication and adds to some operational costs that are more impacting for small shipments.


[09-Mar-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have a PRO license, you can take advantage of this.  I currently have 900t of agri products contracted to be delivered by others to Sand and I'm paying about 9000 credits to others to deliver them.


[09-Mar-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Each day I generate on average 300t of surplus that needs to be shipped.  My "its far away from the CX" is an opportunity for others to make money (and offset shipping costs of their own).

[11-Mar-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	long story: it was supposed to be a metric that would improve the faction contracts you receive, but currently, if it even does that, its so small of a improvement that its basically useless, the only people that actively collect them is to get higher on the leaderboard


[11-Mar-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	there is also some people that are trying to get to the lowest amount possibly of faction reputation by breaching faction contracts

**shagie**:	(le sigh) not_trey hasn't been active for a bit and the tax and COGC setup that is currently in place was based on "make the stuff I make here as a gov is a donation back to the COGC".  If I don't hear back from him at the end of the day (+12h from now) I'll be droping out of my current corp to set up a solo governance corp and setting taxes in accordance with the governance spreadsheet for a target income of 250,000 NCC to cover COGC and programs.


[18-Mar-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The sheet puts it at 10 for PIO, SET, and TEC workers.

[18-Mar-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	And I will have the income and expenses paid on behalf of Verdant in a google sheet.


[18-Mar-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	I know I'm speaking to a veteran here @shagie, but make sure you account for bases that are on Verdant, but not producing. I adjusted taxes on my planet in accordance with the google sheet and I'm only pulling 60% of what was anticipated. And I think its because of dormant bases


[18-Mar-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Big lesson learned with that one lol. But 16k per day is much less than whatever Verdant upkeep will cost you


[18-Mar-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll put the initial benchmark in and see how it goes for a few weeks.  Having it off by 5000 NCC I can swallow the cost.  Having it off by 250,000 isn't something I can support for extended periods of time.  It takes a week or two for it to get in.


[18-Mar-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The estimate for cost per day for Verdant (running regular POPI) is about 45k NCC.

[19-Mar-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	... I need to put down another permit on Sand, and (among other things) build another STO there.


[19-Mar-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(that's six permits I want now)


[19-Mar-24 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm suffering from not having a single STO on Sand and I'm about to have to sacrifice a FRM or just put a second permit finally


[19-Mar-24 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 22 FPs running there - and they're hungry.  They eat a lot of water and agri...


[19-Mar-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	About 200t / day of GRN / BEA / VEG ... and another 120t of water / day.


[19-Mar-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They also produce 30t of DW, 275t of RAT, some ALE, KOM, COF...


[19-Mar-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	and if I didn't have the STO I'd be on a knife's edge of production each day (someone takes 3 days to deliver BEA?  Well, without the STO would only have 4 days of buffer)


[19-Mar-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Now I've got 2 weeks of stuff in stock... but I'm at 5920 / 6500 unless I move some inputs to the warehouse.


[19-Mar-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(the warehouse has 569t of stuff to export)


[19-Mar-24 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If I picked up another permit to do some more production, I'd really want to not be at the 500t of space for imports.


[19-Mar-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I was doing FIM only on Sand for the longest time so I got away without it. but now I'm doing more reasonable production so I can feel that pain


[19-Mar-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm currently at 499 space used on Sand - so... no leeeway there for another STO.


[19-Mar-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

So all the stuff in the queue for the last week has still been paying out to the old corp.  I expect next Sunday's report to be a better indicator for the collection going forward.


[24-Mar-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Mar-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant is largely an export system.  I export ~400 t of stuff each day.  The imports... about 10 t per day for RAT and DW.


[30-Mar-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Understood, thought I'd test the market anyway, with poor results.  I'll leave the contracts up until they expire and then haul stuff back to the CX.


[30-Mar-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For hauling stuff _out_ of Verdant - there's a fair amount of business.


[30-Mar-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And OVE, COF, PWO - those would probably sell well.


[30-Mar-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	OVE is the only thing that sold (didn't put up COF or PWO because I don't make those)


[30-Mar-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	People need to read more.  I had two offers of 25 OVE for 2400 at the bottom of the list, and someone put in a buy request for 50 OVE at 5000 this morning.


[30-Mar-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I'll take the extra money, but felt a little bad.


[30-Mar-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You don't necessarily have to make them.  If you stock it.  For example, if you had 50 COF.NC1 at a unit price of 800 - its easier than flying a ship to import it and you've got 25 on the profit there.  Same with PWO.


[30-Mar-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's not a bad idea, but I figured everybody is in the same boat with almost empty backhauls.  The only things I'm bringing into Verdant are OVE, COF and PWO, and the ship is nearly empty even with a 20 day supply.  Since everyone has lots of room, why would they pay more here?


[30-Mar-24 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Depends on the production.  For example, in another sector of the universe... my base on Harmonia.  I buy all my OVE, COF, PWO on the LM since I don't have a ship down there often.

[31-Mar-24 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I pay more for those, since I've gone through that experience before. I also have decent imports since I don't do FRMs, rather HYFs, so all of my stuff gets posted directly to the CX LM.


[31-Mar-24 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you set a cut-off price for any shipping that you do, you'll likely avoid the trash jobs, that actually cost more in ship depreciation/fuel, than they are actually worth.

**shagie**:	This week's tax collection was 207,660.  Which is much closer to the COGC costs of about 250k.  It might need a slight bump on PIO taxes, but nothing significant.  I'll wait another week before making any changes.

**Zugore**:	quick question on the local market...are shipping ads offers to ship or solicitations for shipping?


[09-Apr-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	solicitations.  i have mats to get to moria and i will pay you to take them on your ship.


[09-Apr-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thx, the tutorial wasn't clear on that.


[09-Apr-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Survivalist_Redo**:	oh rip I thought it was the other way around


[09-Apr-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it'd be really neat to see another ad type, like "freight" where you could allocate a fixed portion of your ship and a timeline. it'd simplify a lot of planning around it. however implementing the ui for it... probably not as simple


[09-Apr-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I try to size my shipping contracts so they strike a balance between smaller (easier to fit into someone's not-quite-full ship) and bigger (so I don't clutter the LM with a dozen tiny shipments).


[09-Apr-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	From my days of doing shipping, I like 100, 200 and 250 sized units the best.  100 means that I can pick and chose.  Sometimes I could get an 80/100 (paying 1k) load and a 110/100 load (paying 1.1k) and make better use of my capacity (and more money).


[09-Apr-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	200 was ok, but 2 of them mean that I also needed a 100 or some of my own hauling in that direction.


[09-Apr-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	250 was also ok, two fit perfectly, but meant that I ether needed 100s or a 200 and some of my own hauling.  Often I had things that I wanted to also move from Verdant to Sand or Moria.


[09-Apr-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	500 I tended to avoid unless it was _everything_ since I wouldn't be able to fit anything else on that trip.  I'd rather than 4x 100s and 100 of my own stuff than a 500 since the profit on my own stuff was more than the shipping contract.  A 500 wouldn't let me do that.


[09-Apr-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I've been sizing mine at 200t/175m³, I'll cut it back to 100/88 to be more flexible.  Especially since Verdant ads are free.


[09-Apr-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Free Verdant ads (and warehouses) are one of the things I find _very_ useful for doing shipping.


[09-Apr-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(tangential - the last tax collection payout was 214,940 NCC).  COGC is fully funded this cycle.  COGC costs were 203,847.  I didn't run any programs (those cost 50k - 150k).


[09-Apr-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I loathe posting elsewhere. nothing like paying for an ad that wasn't good enough to get accepted and being out the cash


[09-Apr-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PIO education out continues to be at a steady 1534 / week.  PIO unemployment is 3.6% which is about 8,425 PIO - this will take some addressing ... soonish.

[09-Apr-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Technicians are at 371 with 32% unemployment with a net change of -72 per week.  That has 120 unemployed (please contact me before doing any ORC builds so that I won't be too surprised by that running out)


[09-Apr-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Love the transparency, thanks shagie!


[09-Apr-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've changed the staffing level of the safety station and infirmary from 1 to 2.  Currently, those are running at near minimum levels (10 built) to increase safety and health levels.  This will deplete the reserves there sooner.  The reserves currently are for ~250 days (OFF.NC1 at 245 days) to 114 days with TUB.NC1 for the INF.  That should boost happiness a little bit, though means that I'll need to pay attention to that (again, at some point soonish).  There's been a bit of discussion on how governance will impact POPI ... I will likely also run tech immigration next week. 50k NCC for that.  Current estimations put that within no significant impact on the overall balance - I'll have to see what forecasts for the following week.  I may raise production fees from 10 to 11 to address any shortfall in the balance.


[09-Apr-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(... and that was much longer than I intended to type)


[09-Apr-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	another quickie: re consumables, is that based on my employed workforce or total workforce? trying to figure out of that's going to increase when I add buildings (within my current max) so I can plan a month's inventory in advance.


[09-Apr-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The current (how many are currently there).  Should be close to / similar to the required.


[09-Apr-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Capacity is "empty rooms" - no one in the room means no one in the room eats.


[09-Apr-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	workfirce size/capacity 200/200, required 120


[09-Apr-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so current consumption based on required then ?


[09-Apr-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**LYET**:	Yeah, I usually have at least 200/200 capacity (usually more) going from Moria to Verdant. I suspect a lot of newer players are in the same boat. Our main constraint is capital, not ship space, so smaller sized shipping contracts in either direction are very welcome.


[12-Apr-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I come here nearly empty more often than not


[12-Apr-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	The PIO unemployment real number is 6,950.  And while that is low (and I do want to get it up a bit higher) it isn't excessively concerning _now_.  The target for many is 10% which represents 23,000 unemployed PIO.

**Swaggie**:	hey, noob question. How do i assign workforce to my rig? i have built my base and constructed the buildings and set up queues, but for the RIG it shows halted in red, and i think it;s because i have no pioneers assigned


[15-Apr-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you don't assign workforce, it's automatic, but they must be available....could also be a consumable issue


[15-Apr-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	they require DW, RAT, and OVE  as basic consumables; COF and PWO as luxuries to increase efficiency


[15-Apr-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swaggie**:	Hmm okay, thanks i'll tinker a bit to see what's up!


[15-Apr-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Btw, yes, Verdant is the best world.


[16-Apr-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	LM and Warehouse fees will always remain at 0.  I might be raising taxes a little bit over time ... need to find the proper settings, but I want to keep them as low as possible.


[16-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the things you might want to consider doing is shipping the YI-683c stuff on a short haul into Verdant, and then you can make use of the abundant outbound shippers from Verdant to Moria.


[16-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(you could also easily ship _into_ Verdant and then jump it over to Arcadia on a short haul)


[16-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Not going to argue that.  Not 100% sure on best, but Verdant seems to be a pretty low-stress way to print money.  All the little guys need is some caffeine and something to wear and the mats flow endlessly (and profitably).

**Pharnacis**:	If I just want to make my own basic clothing instead of buying it, is it worth starting another colony instead of just adding a BMP to my original?


[17-Apr-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I have a daily surplus of about 90, and I could supply about 50 more right now if you need.


[17-Apr-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	My first base on Vallis is about half BMPs, they're very flexible with the stuff they can make, and a lot of it is profitable even if you buy the inputs.


[17-Apr-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I'd have to build somewhere other than Vallis since it's full, but yeah. I was thinking along those lines.


[17-Apr-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Ok ok. Festivals = increase worker hapiness. I suppose you could increase Pioneer satisfaction, with festivities, to around 70% to avoid a drop in population. But like you said, there's nothing to worry about for now. (And for other workers, unemployment is okay).


[17-Apr-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	BMPs are buildings that take a large workforce - you'd need a HB1 to fill the workforce of the BMP itself (a FRM is 50, BMP is 100)


[17-Apr-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have a BMP, you want it running 100% of the time - otherwise you're losing money on the workforce being idle.


[17-Apr-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For a HMP doing RCO -> OVE, you'd need 2 FRMs making 100% RCO in order to keep the BMP running.


[17-Apr-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I'd be importing PG and growing cotton to make overalls


[17-Apr-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	But I guess I'm not sure if I'd be able to keep it running 100% of the time


[17-Apr-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	OVE.NC1 that you make (with it running 100% of the time) have an effective cost of 85 NCC / unit.


[17-Apr-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll note that the 85 NCC is higher than the 76.


[17-Apr-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can save 10 NCC by buying the OVE at Moria and bringing them in on your ship the next time you fly out there.


[17-Apr-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	That's odd. They're selling for less than they cost to make? Is the price driven down by supply coming from the dailies sometimes?


[17-Apr-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They are selling for less than they cost to make _here_.


[17-Apr-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Ah, I see.


[17-Apr-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On a planet with a COGC bonus for manufacturing, they're cheaper to make.


[17-Apr-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Though when I buy them I'm also paying to send a ship there and back


[17-Apr-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you send them through a WPL to make COT, it may also make the process cheaper.


[17-Apr-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you fly from Moria back to Verdant, do you have 50t of space available?


[17-Apr-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Yeah, pretty much always. So I guess the shipping cost wouldn't matter, if I'm sending the ship anyway.


[17-Apr-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  (aside, may even be able to put up a cheap "space available" hauling.  500 OVE takes up 12.5m3.  You could have someone haul that back for you for 250 NCC.


[17-Apr-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, there's a bit of spread on OVE.NC1 -- if buy buy them at the high price its 107 / unit.  If you put it up as a buy order that sits in the requests you could get them for 76 or there abouts.


[17-Apr-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other thing to consider ... and there's the 107 price that got updated.


[17-Apr-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Can you do something that makes _more_ money with 12 area on your base than a BMP?


[17-Apr-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Having a FP also takes 12 area... and you could make RAT (or DW or buy some COF and brew it)


[17-Apr-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... buy some CAF and brew it rather.


[17-Apr-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://prun.plexucra.de/building/


[17-Apr-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I can probably make a lot more money just by doing the same thing I've been doing with RAT


[17-Apr-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	But it's getting old and somewhat boring TBH


[17-Apr-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Then expand.


[17-Apr-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I expanded to Frost first - started building INC (for C) and EXT (for H2O).  Then to Sand where I moved all my FPs.


[17-Apr-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Yeah, I noticed Sand


[17-Apr-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	And figured I would eventually start shifting my FP stuff there too


[17-Apr-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got a base on Circa where I've got a BMP ... and I'm going to be shipping up 500t of RCO soon to start the WPL -> COT -> OVE & PWO


[17-Apr-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Circe is _really_ good for chem, but also take a glance at YI-705c


[17-Apr-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While YI-705c is PIO and SET only, you can do CHP and POL.


[17-Apr-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XIT FIN says that Circe makes me 93k/day.  Sand makes me 87k/day.  Verdant is 3 permits at 86k/day.  ... And YI-705c making CL and EPO and PG is my 4th most profitable base (again 1 permit) at 83k / day.


[17-Apr-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion does HER and HOP at 58k /day.  Frost is C and H2O at 49.


[17-Apr-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Then I've got the set of planets on XH-594 doing construction, metal, and fuel.


[17-Apr-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	Alright, I'll build and save up a bit more then look into one of those options for expansion.


[17-Apr-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	@shagie, any opinion on XG-430b and c?  I started on Vallis, expanded to Verdant mainly for O and C but also make DW and RAT.  My next steps are going to be manufacturing on XG-430a to get the BMPs off Vallis and then FP on XG-430c.


[17-Apr-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I haven't looked too deeply at XG-430.  For me, Sand  makes a lot more sense for Verdant based agri.


[17-Apr-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XG-430c is intended to be paired up with XG-452b


[17-Apr-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Green is the Verdant - Sand - MOR route for food.  Blue is the XG-452b - XG-430c route for a high volume DW.


[17-Apr-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Trying to ship agri to XG-430 from Verdant is a long haul.


[17-Apr-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I guess it seemed similar to the Verdant-MOR route I'm doing now, but I can see where the Sand logistics would be much better.


[17-Apr-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I also ship water from Frost to Sand for DW.


[17-Apr-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Well, that wasn't quite what I wanted.  The education from SET to TEC went up a bit (good), but so did the PIO to SET (bad).


[17-Apr-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Happiness is still an issue.  Gonna run Festivals III which will get PIO back to higher levels - should get some immigration from that.  Next week I'll likely run tech immigration.


[17-Apr-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Upping the Safety Station from 2 to 5.  Still a lot in the bank there, though going to need to think about within 2 months.


[17-Apr-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	(I don't have any immediate plans, I'm just asking).


[20-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	also depends a lot on your deadline, I've seen shipments with long delivery times (5+ days) go for way less, whereas the price Kegman mentioned is good for ~3 days of deadline


[21-Apr-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	so that's another knob you can use to control cost


[21-Apr-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	weight/volume, distance, and expediency requirements all factor in...


[21-Apr-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the bigger it is, the farther its gotta go and the speed you want it there...


[21-Apr-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	all drive up the cost of transport.


[21-Apr-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Ok, thanks @Zugore & @dakota1234 ! I'll take a look at what's usually done in LM based on these 3 criteria.


[21-Apr-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you look on the LM now, there's a small package headed for MOR at like 120 ncc...that's going to sit there until someone happens to be headed that way and has room for it.


[21-Apr-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(which I might in a few days - weds/thurs)


[21-Apr-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can also check the listings at MOR - will give you a bigger sample


[21-Apr-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Yes, I saw it earlier. I'll see how long it'll be available :)


[21-Apr-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	average rate for standard 3-day shipping is 10 ncc/ t or m3...so in you example from earlier 90t/100m3...that would be 1000 NCC (someone could feasible take 5 of those in one shot, with a 3-day timeline, minimal fuel (200 units total) to MOR takes about 22 hours...5k less 2800 fuel cost, 2200 profit.


[21-Apr-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	I also use Tradefinder on https://fio.fnar.net/ to give me samples.


[21-Apr-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	ok ok! that's the price I had in mind


[21-Apr-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you tweak your rate if you want it to move a little faster....or sooner...but you also have to factor in your own margins (paying 5k for shipping if the load is only going to make you 3k, you get the point)


[21-Apr-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	haulers are also looking for the back-end....so if I have a decent haul into verdant, and your 1k is sitting there, I would grab it up so my back-haul isn't empty/unpaid.


[21-Apr-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'll be into and out of verdant weekly going forward (have a standing contract, plus my own provisioning), so keeping an eye on the LM. Ships are always on the move.


[21-Apr-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Okok, I see. That's why I'm looking at prices right now. Not least to calculate when I'll be more interested in a trip to LM than in going myself (when there's not enough contract for my return, for example). Thanks a lot!


[21-Apr-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	does anyone have 1-BDE on Verdant you could sell me (apparently I changed my plan after procurement and I have all the stuff here or headed here already, but am short 1-BDE)?

**shagie**:	This week's tax collection was 250,240 NCC (up from last week's 231,560 - about 10% higher).  Still looking for the "how much does the increase in POPI spending and Festivals" with the next population report.


[21-Apr-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep. I'm still about.


[21-Apr-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The Festivals III from the 17th kicked the PIO population up 33k (compare, a my 3 permit all PIO is 1500 population).  IALso, the technician population had a +97 change (102 education in, 1 education out, 4 migration out) ... which is also good.


[24-Apr-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd like to target running Festivals III every other week until PIO population gets to a comfortable amount of unemployment.


[24-Apr-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... wait a moment... 0.9% unemployment?  Last week it was 3.0% ...


[24-Apr-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dalinard**:	Thank you, very interesting. The data in the document can be used to calculate ranges of potential tax increases and include them in expense calculations for production projects.


[25-Apr-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's a way to make sure that I can keep the balance under control.  The week of 3/24 - 3/31 some others donated to the COGC which is why I got a large surplus there... Negative values are "I owe Verdant money" and positive values are "Verdant owes me money".


[25-Apr-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Tax estimation is difficult - as is prediction of what programs will be.  COGC estimates are there ... though you'll note the "Plot fudge" value which is things like the planetary admin buildings and I suspect corp HQs.


[25-Apr-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And I'm gonna fix the "planet run rate" equation on the Ledger sheet.

[26-Apr-24 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Absolutely, Shagie is doing a fantastic job as a governor, actually helping us grow the planet


[26-Apr-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I honestly don't mind if the taxes are raised as long as the planet is run properly, but of course, Shagie has been doing a good job running Verdant and is very responsive. I definitely don't see a need in change of government ;p


[26-Apr-24 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	@shagie yes, given all the variable data that goes into the calculations, it doesn't surprise me that forecasting taxes and programs is complex. Thanks for the explanations.

[28-Apr-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	also when would you recommend starting to repair buildings? I'm 3 months on so some of the first ones are starting to decay a bit


[28-Apr-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	building decay starts to affect efficiency at 70%, ships speed at 80%


[28-Apr-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	all the mats for your CM have to be on one ship


[28-Apr-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	workforce pop here on verdant is about 250k


[28-Apr-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	starting on a planet with 0 existing workforce will limit you to 200 PIO that come with the CM, beyond that, you'll need to build planetary infrastructure

**shagie**:	This week's taxes were 289,910.  This is up 16% from last week (the 10 -> 12 production fee increase can take a week to show up).  The books are in the "bouncing back and forth" side of 0.  This went from Verdant owing me 169k to me owing Verdant 120k.  The PE.NC1 for COGC is on its way - this will be 1264 units to cover COGC ... and that will come out of the 120k that I owe verdant.  There's also a Festivals III to be run next week to continue to get PIO population up.


[28-Apr-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	and what you're goals are


[30-Apr-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	currently looking to stay on the free licence, so that means I can do 5 bases total, looking at 1 production, 1 support and 2 ressource bases currently. I think I know what I want to go after, I was just unsture if there would be any benefit outside of the shorter transport times, if 2 of the new bases end up being in the same cluster. Does not seem like it


[30-Apr-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there's no specific benefit to same cluster no...the only bonuses that link between bases are dependent on where your HQ is located


[30-Apr-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Like a limit of how far it will reach or?


[30-Apr-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The logistics load would be the largest issue.  You've only got two ships and can't put up shipping contracts.


[30-Apr-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	for you here on verdant, it's in non-faction space, so you get 4% efficiency bonus to refining, extraction, and chemistry...

**Zugore**:	at all your bases


[30-Apr-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	TO-392 has a good bit of development going on it.  One jump outside of Moria.


[30-Apr-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The real thing is the cost of good manufacturing... and I'd argue the second is logistics.


[30-Apr-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Frost (XG-326d) has some of the most water in terms of raw water ... but its mineral water which means that the cost to extract it is higher and rate is lower than liquid water.


[30-Apr-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Good planet too, bit too far away for me currently though


[30-Apr-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Iscorta**:	ya still get no plant found


[01-May-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	okay its being a fool then


[01-May-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	planet does exist just the game seems to be acting funny


[01-May-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	i believe you


[01-May-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	that ones works by the way


[01-May-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	it picks that up but not the other


[01-May-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	XG-430c?


[01-May-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	oh yours worked


[01-May-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Iscorta**:	so captials makes i difference im guessing


[01-May-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No he typed 432 instead of 430

[01-May-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	looking at sand/sabaton - the core module takes extra ressources to build on both worlds, does that mean that all buildings on those planets require extra of those?


[01-May-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes


[01-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Interesting, sounds like more spreadsheets to me :D


[01-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it depends on the planetary  features (high or low pressure, temperature, gravity and rocky or gaseous surface)


[01-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	That's pretty cool actually, anyway to know how much extra before I build the hq?

**Dover**:	Need a few extra MCG for repairs


[01-May-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Got'cha.


[01-May-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yea! 13.5% PIO unemployment and 28.1% TEC unemployment.


[01-May-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Nice work!


[02-May-24 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I didn't do nothing but noticed the thin margins and ran a program.  I'm glad it worked as well as it did.  Nothing planned for this week... I want to see where the PIO happiness sorts out to without festivals.


[02-May-24 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd like to get PIO stable with traditional POPI and manage techs with tech immigration as needed - its a lot cheaper.


[02-May-24 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Oh, great! That went fast. Let's hope it stabilizes naturally.

[02-May-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Gonna make second base on sand, opted against Sabaton - place has the highest crafting fee's in this part of the universe


[02-May-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sand is an excelent place to expand to and provides a natural "make more agri on Verdant" and ship it to Sand for either reduced cost in making the same amount or increased capacity.


[02-May-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The increased capacity on each world can then be used for things like "I'm growing HER too" ... and the FIM recipie is slow.


[02-May-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Agri -> RAT is 5x faster than RAT -> FIM)


[02-May-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was looking into longterm expanding towards chemistry, so the limestone on sabbaton would be nice


[02-May-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'm likely going towards Frost as 3rd instead


[02-May-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HAL tends to be the most profitable chem lines.


[02-May-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HAL -> CL -> DDT -> (HER -> FIM! and we're back to agri and food)


[02-May-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, was looking at how to get to ddt


[02-May-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its a while out to be able to support it though


[02-May-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Circe (QQ-001b) as the techs for staffing the labs.


[02-May-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	YI-705c is a POLy world with rich HAL resources (no techs for labs ... but can really churn out EPO with just PIO and SET)


[02-May-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, there are a few options, not sure what I want yet


[02-May-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	plenty of time to figure it out


[02-May-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That there is.  Circe is nice... triple green, nothing special needed.  Its got reasonable HAL and doing "just" CHP for CL and be quite profitable.  The main thing to keep in mind with DDT and EPO is the C requirements ... if you're self supplying there.


[02-May-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	main thing for me is to get a bit of crash on hand, so I can upgrade my two starter ships. Currently I need all my funds for the planet expansion


[02-May-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	seen a few advertise selling parts a bit cheaper to people with accounts younger then 180 days, so gonna see if I can raise some money towards that


[02-May-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Shipyard projects (and contracts and loans) are all part of PRO license features.


[02-May-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, I figured I'd run into problems with the starter ships at one point anyway. So if I need to pay for a licence, might as well try and get something out of it


[02-May-24 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	also, I would need pro to build a ship later right? Basic is not enough?


[02-May-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Same with planet expansion beyond 5


[02-May-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can play for a long time with a free license.  It won't _really_ hit road blocks until a few months.  However, the things that a pro license (even for a month) offers can significantly change the game.  Things like shipping contracts... on average I put up about 5000 NCC of shipping contracts for others each day.


[02-May-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and that's money I give other players to move some of my agri from Verdant to Sand (most often).


[02-May-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Its a bit slow, but 3 months in I'm starting to enjoy it more


[02-May-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	also I completely get that some features are locked behind the subscription. Downside is that it does lock you out of the mmo aspect of the game not having it


[02-May-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It does.  The lock out is because its way too easy to get 100 of one's "friends" on a twitch stream to join, transfer all of their stuff to you and COLIQ otherwise.


[02-May-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea exactly, something like that is bound to be abused


[02-May-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Thus, its gated behind a pro license ... and then the "get a bunch of people to give you their goods" is often less than you could get with a loan from another established player without even the slightest bent rule.


[02-May-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Would it be worth it to wait with upgrading my hq until I can get an Insitor Cooperative planet? Now that I'm mainly making foods and such


[02-May-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Scratch that, too far to be usefull rn


[02-May-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	OZ-189 is an interesting chem system if you wanted a base in that segment of space.  Upgrading HQ is indpedent of moving.  As an outer reaches non-faction, we get a bonus to resource extraction - which speeds up RIGs (and INCs)


[02-May-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, I'm just gonna upgrade here to get permits I think


[02-May-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HQ upgrades are _everywhere_.  It doesn't matter where you have your HQ as long as its in the faction you want it to be in.


[02-May-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There is some late game stuff... for example FireFreak's HQ upgrades take multiple large ships to move in ... and that has some logistical challenges with it that make the _exact_ place for the HQ of importance.


[02-May-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But for anyone with ... less than 20? 30? HQ level ... doesn't matter as long as its where you want it.


[02-May-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	not likely to go above 5 for a long time


[02-May-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	if something changes I can always make another in a different area of space if needed


[02-May-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep... and honestly, outer reaches is not bad.  RIGs, EXTs, INCs?  Yep.  those are all nice to boost.  CHP and LAB?  Those are my most profitable things - boost all the more.


[02-May-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was thinking about Frost as 3rd planet, more water and moving some crops there to burn for carbon


[02-May-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	working towards that ddt


[02-May-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Frost for C is good.  For water it is ok in that its not the worst.  Mineral water is difficult to work with.


[02-May-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I have a metric I call "A300" -- what is 300 area worth of collector (discounting HB1s) for quick comparisons of production.


[02-May-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Larger numbers are better.  Frost is 741.85.  Verdant is 1,099.97.  XG-452b is 1,490.17.


[02-May-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant's water will be cheaper, but if you're using all of Verdant's water for agri, frost's water is still profitable to extract.


[02-May-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That XG-452b is _really_ interesting if you get into large scale DW production.


[02-May-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I like RC-639a for water since it's basically between MOR and Verdant


[02-May-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(XG-452b is the 4th best water world in the universe)


[02-May-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RC-639a is 1,338.37.


[02-May-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(RC-639a is the 10th best.  Etherwind is at #13 with 1,260.00.  Boucher is 5th at 1,470.00)


[02-May-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I agree XG-452b looks good. Back when I started I tried to keep the number of jumps to a minimum. The was before shipbuilding took off. Now it's easier.


[02-May-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's a food industry world in an adjacent system for XG-452b too)


[02-May-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I guess the two extra jumps is worth it for easier water


[02-May-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	actually RC-639a has a really nice location


[02-May-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I might just go with that one


[02-May-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	hi temp and hi pressure, that's adds about 29k cost to each building


[02-May-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	hmm


[02-May-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	always somehting :D


[02-May-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sry, correction, 39k


[02-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	mats TSH and HSE, 1 each for each building


[02-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea so a rig is 3x the price that it would be here


[02-May-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yep, it would be all the same mats as here, plus the tsh and hse


[02-May-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	too bad, location would have been perfect for me


[02-May-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just another element to consider with branching out...https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/building-costs/index.html#costs-calculation

[02-May-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm looking around too, that handbook page is coming in quite handy in factoring costs/benefits.


[02-May-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	current favorite for water s xg-452b then


[02-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I would pay more, but output would be higher too


[02-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats also hi temp/hi pres


[02-May-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though granted I'm not looking for water, since we have Verdant.


[02-May-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	water is good, I would just like more of it


[02-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	so having rigs on a world with an extraction program would be better


[02-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	452 has that and with your hq here you get added bonus to extraction


[02-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	plus workforce and experts


[02-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, I'll try to math it out tomorrow, see what my cost comes to


[02-May-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Frost also in the loop still, cheaper to build there and has extraction program


[02-May-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	but I don't know the ratio between mineral and liquid water


[02-May-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats a shagie ?


[02-May-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	maybe I just use another permit here and get more space for rigs


[02-May-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	also an option


[02-May-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	grow the hq before using the second permit though so you retain the ratio bonus


[02-May-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	first HQ level upgrade is like 34k


[02-May-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I made a shopping list


[02-May-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	to maintain current ratio, you'd need to bump it to level 3


[02-May-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I think


[02-May-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'll build on sand during the weekend, then move all FP's there to free up space here


[02-May-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The red bars are a "this is a startup cost" - the real question is what is the ROI on the buildings and what is the _cost_ of water?


[02-May-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Water on Verdant costs 12 NCC to make.  On Frost, its 16 NCC.


[02-May-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, I will have to math that out before I figure out what is best to do


[02-May-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On XG-452b it is 14.


[02-May-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	guess it would be 14 on rc-639a too then


[02-May-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	15.59


[02-May-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	our resident font of knowledge ^


[02-May-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, very helpful


[02-May-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gonna work out a proper Cost Per Unit for all resources in the game based on NC1 prices for stuff and production per day per permit (if you were to build a 500 area base with just EXT or RIG or COL ... how much would you get per day?


[02-May-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Kinda like Frost because its more developed, so the prospect of doing more there later, is better


[02-May-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Frost isn't nice _just_ for the water ... the entire _system_ is nice.


[02-May-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XG-326d is nice... XG-326 is very nice.


[02-May-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	midway-sand is much cheaper, just sealant there


[02-May-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah but 326 has a lot of thing that make it a viable system even with its harsh cconditions


[02-May-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i have three bases planned for that system


[02-May-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	was just looking at that


[02-May-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	frost and bastion c i have plans for first, bastion a is my next plan because it has limestone and silicon which i both can make use of


[02-May-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	titanium or i can pick up as well and move to 705c or arcadia to smelt to then sell or use


[02-May-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I woulden't mind some limestone, not going into metals just yet


[02-May-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	silicon can be mixed with limestone to make mcg


[02-May-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	depending on extraction rates you could make thousands of units per day


[02-May-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	looking to make NS from it, progressing towards more chemistry


[02-May-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah thats what im planning as well, thats where 705c comes in


[02-May-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ah right you have a chemistry program there


[02-May-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	and you got the hydrogen from harpina, I see we are working towards the same


[02-May-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah i plan to have chem plants there


[02-May-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its an interesting game, reminds me a lot of Eve


[02-May-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	its based off eve, just without the fighting


[02-May-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I just priced out a starter on Bastion a - it's on my list now


[02-May-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	BTW, TIO takes a _long_ time to cook.


[02-May-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im staring at 552c for one particular mineral


[02-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the letter prefix is helpful


[02-May-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	YI-552C


[02-May-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	plan to do a mixed base there, mixture of EXT, BMP and POL


[02-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	he said a dirty word...mixed base....lol


[02-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm not one that could possibly talk though


[02-May-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	shagie shutters anytime I mention whta I'm doing


[02-May-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ext for mining the mgs, bmp to turn it into mg, pol to turn it into pg


[02-May-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	oh I know


[02-May-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah world be dedicated to resource extraction, manufacturing and chemistry


[02-May-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	next five worlds is bastion A, C and frost, Sand and 552c


[02-May-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	starting out you have to mix things a bit, don't really have the capital to min/max


[02-May-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	oh im old lol


[02-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I started 3 months ago, things have been running most of the time


[02-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I started 3 weeks ago


[02-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	579 days


[02-May-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	although my account is just shy of 1000 days old


[02-May-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	think its like 980 or something


[02-May-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	once ive got this monsterous loan paid off ill start prpepping stuff for frost base and sand


[02-May-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was gonna settle on sand, now I'm unsure again lol


[02-May-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	sand is a good planet for food industries


[02-May-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea it is


[02-May-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I might need to just for the bonus


[02-May-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	people who produce raw crops here or elsewhere nearby take it there. plus its slap bang in the middle of the main run from moria to verdant and further


[02-May-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I might need to just for the added acreage here


[02-May-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	once i set up there ill be offloading my FPs tp it and increasing crop output here


[02-May-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	might swap to hyf here i need 705c to pic up


[02-May-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	sand, frost and then bastion a for the limestone


[02-May-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i need a source of nitrogen but the closest planet thats viable for that is kub


[02-May-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	still main run which is good


[02-May-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes, been looking at that one too


[02-May-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ZahnP**:	or the projects in it rather


[02-May-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	all queues forr that building need to be cleared and there is a section that tells you "reclaimed materials"


[02-May-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	ok, so I can't destroy something with a running job


[02-May-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	buildings become less efficient at 70%, ships slow down at 80%


[03-May-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but I think the better answer is, before it becomes cost-prohibituve


[03-May-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes indeed, I see I wrote 180 days in my formula at some point, but I can't remember where I got that number from


[03-May-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	@shagie - you mentioned yesterday 1 FRM supports 2 INC burning only GRN, that produces 8 C/day, correct? I'm using 2 FRM to support 1 INC generating 12 C/day (burning the HCP/GRN/MAI mix)...is there something I'm missing?


[03-May-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I was gonna set up my INC burning MAI, but will wait doing that until I have a planet with an extraction program


[03-May-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	with your HQ here, your extractors are operating at a 15% boost...it's adding a nice income boost in the short term.


[03-May-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I should clarify that - mine are operating at 115%, HQ + 2 experts.


[03-May-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	it is, but I don't want to fan out doing too many things currently


[03-May-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm younger so our expert levels are likely different for the other categories


[03-May-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I got 3 agri/3 food industry experts currently


[03-May-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	after sand is set up, I'm gonna move the 3 food experts to ressource extraction. Got 3 unused ones there atm


[03-May-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm at 2/2/2 active in agri, fp and ext...1 avail in agri and ext.


[03-May-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	simply a time factor...


[03-May-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes it is


[03-May-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Its quite expensive to expand currently, setting up sand with 2 habs and 5 FP's, while also upgrading HQ to 3 came close to 450k


[03-May-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	know all about that...but I've been hauling freight since I started so there's been steady income to support growth - and a few very generous players offering assistance in the form of lucrative contracts and grants.


[03-May-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I've only been flying when I needed something or could fill the ship. So a bit slower start, but most days I've honestly not spend more then 5 mins on the game


[03-May-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	until recently....


[03-May-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I went full immersion...though my interaction is slowing down a bit now, I still have it open on the screen most of the day


[03-May-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its very chill game when you don't have to fly for contracts all the time


[03-May-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	5-10 min checking production queues and prices


[03-May-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's nice that it has the flexibility to enable one to go either way, slow and steady or active and engaged.


[03-May-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yes indeed


[03-May-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I'm adding planet tax in minutes to my sheet, but for some reason the value I calculate does not fit the displayed value on jobs? Anyone else have that problem?


[03-May-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i believe taxes showing on orders are base(without the efficiency added)


[03-May-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	good point, I'll try the math again


[03-May-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	for eg: time for HER to is 2 days with 100% efficieny


[03-May-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	You are right, if I multiply my number with the effiency % its better


[03-May-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	only difference then is just due to rounding of numbers


[03-May-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	round to up


[03-May-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Geraldivar**:	Okay, my base is set up, I’m a Victualler, but I can already see that my 1 FRM is insufficient in providing me with enough income to pay for stuff. Like, I need at least 1 more FRM to keep in the black, in particular if I want to buy overalls and stuff, which last only… 5-6 days right now, not to mention STL and FTL fuel to get to Moria.


[05-May-24 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	its a bit of a trip to the cx, you want to go slow though, to save fuel


[05-May-24 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	so starting out bring what you can to sell, and be back before you run out of materials and your production stops


[05-May-24 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	flying to market like 1 time pr week starting out is fine


[05-May-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Yes, if you're careful, it's okay. For my part, I'm making slow progress, but it's working.


[05-May-24 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I just started my second planet, 3 months in. Its a slow paced game, but as long as you know the margins you are working with and moving forward, everything is good


[05-May-24 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I was just checking out if there was anything on the trip worthwhile to take with, because empty cargo is meh, and I found someone wanting to buy OFF at a local market, but the asking price is the same as the lowest offer I could get it for at CX. So with stopping there to drop the OFF off, that’s… a bad deal, right? The margin is negative due to fuel expense.


[05-May-24 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Yea, its not worth moving something unless you profit on it


[05-May-24 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I guess you can do favors for people if you want to, but moving things for free will not allow you to pay for anything later


[05-May-24 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	There are contracts here daily worth taking though


[05-May-24 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, the pure shipping instead of procurement and delivery might be worthwhile.


[05-May-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea the one paying 6k is a pretty standard pick up/drop off contract


[05-May-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	and its direct to the station you are going to also


[05-May-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, exactly.


[05-May-24 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Do that and it paid for your supplies


[05-May-24 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, deliver a bit of water and rations and return with a bit of fuel and I’m in the black.


[05-May-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yep


[05-May-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Might pick up material for another farmstead while I’m there, too.


[05-May-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Keep in mind that every job you start has a small fee to it as well, so don't spend everything you have at the cx


[05-May-24 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, yes, that ^^;


[05-May-24 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	a farm will cost you about 20k in materials


[05-May-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Is there a quick command to see the prices of stuff at the CX? Like, CXL NC1 RAT or something?


[05-May-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-24 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dalinard**:	XD


[05-May-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Someone can correct me if I'm talking nonsense, but if you want to make rations to sell, check that selling the raw products isn't more profitable at the moment.


[05-May-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's usually not the case


[05-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	It depends on the raw materials, but when I last checked BEA, GRN, VEG together sold for about 900, while 10 RAT sold for 1080, so the profit is about 150, depending on price changes.


[05-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Taxes this cycle were 305,890 NCC (up 5.51% from last cycle).  I've got the goods for the next COGC cycle (starts in 1 day) in my warehouse.  That's expected to be about 207k NCC based on current prices.  I'm going to be replenishing the POPI.  The infirmary needs some TUB.NC1 and the saftey station needs a bit of DW.NC1, OFF.NC1 and SUN.NC1 (this is what the surplus is going to be going to - restocking).  The POPR is in another 4 days (no programs this cycle to see how it is"natural").  Unemployment is above 10% for all used pop tiers.


[05-May-24 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	👍


[06-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	I wanted to revisit the question of producing raw material  instead of RAT directly. I'm new to this type of analysis, and I still feel like I haven't fully grasped it. After recalculating this morning, I still have the impression that it's more beneficial for a small enterprise to produce GRN (for example) rather than RAT. //  My reasoning // For RAT / longest production time: VEG 2.6  u/t for 1 seed + RAT production time: (7.14) = 9.74 u/t for 10 RAT / priced at 115NCC - total: 1,150 NNC //


[06-May-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	For GRN / 17.85 u/t for 10 units / priced at 273NCC  = total: 2,730 NNC / difference of 45.43% in production time / deducting 45.43% from the price of GRN= 1,490 NCC //  Hence, it seems that for a small enterprise without multiple production lines, producing GRN might be preferable to RAT ? Thanks to the person who can answer me 🙏


[06-May-24 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	with your prices if not mistaken. with 4 agri experts and ZERO FP experts.3cycle of is GRN close to 17 hrs yields 273x12=3276 NCC. 3 cycle RAT(30RAT) again close to 18 hrs. yields 3450NCC. +left overs 1bea/grn/veg which u can sell. add total  So with RAT production even in Verdant yields about +%25 profit over only Grain production.


[06-May-24 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	with added NO building degradation or consumables


[06-May-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you might also consider RAT production for your own consumption, alongside excess grain in an incinerator to sell Carbon.


[06-May-24 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	we are a non-aligned world, so extraction is one of your natural HQ bonuses...and this is an agri world so the cog offers a nice bonus as well


[06-May-24 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Alright, I understand! Thanks for the answers. I do produce rations for myself, but indeed, just the surplus from the OVE, due to time, makes the production of GRN uninteresting. I now understand why I'm progressing so slowly ^^' Thank you very much!


[06-May-24 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	And yes, considering the HQ bonus, things could have been different. I'll proceed with a production reorganization then.


[06-May-24 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	with dedicated FP world like Sand WB-675c. Ohh boy.. i had to have another farm world (Proxion) to keep up with Sands production speed.


[06-May-24 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	XD Ok ! I'm sorry for anyone who was taking advantage of getting cheap GRN then. You've convinced me :)


[06-May-24 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	@Zugore, I just went to check out the incinerator (had to leave for an appointment in the meantime). It does seem very practical for valorizing surplus production. I'll keep that in mind, thanks for the info.


[06-May-24 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have one...though only managed to sell one partial load, as I'm now using the C in the BMP (along with purchased H) to make PE, which enables me to produce OVE (PE + RCO - grown on FRM, with purchased NS)...this stuff gets complicated.


[06-May-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Everything is optimized, I see :)


[06-May-24 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	eventually this base will get streamlined/optimized in line with CoGC/etc, but here at the outset I'm trying to minimize expenses while maximizing self-sufficiency and growth. O is "free" and provides a nice income stream.


[06-May-24 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	optimization can only really come with multiple bases, each taking advantage of the planetary rss and CoGC (along with HQ bonuses and experts)


[06-May-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but new bases cost big money (depending on the planet and build)....


[06-May-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Yes, I see about the different bases. In any case, you already have the process in mind. I'll take some time to think about all of this too.


[06-May-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my income right now is private contracts, oxygen sales, and faction contracts.


[06-May-24 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Yes, I saw that depending on the ecosystems, there could be additional costs/materials.


[06-May-24 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	What do you mean by private contracts? Is it someone asking you, for example, for 300 RAT at a preferential rate?


[06-May-24 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	no, shipping contracts mostly...(though there is a particular individual that has taken an interest in helping advance me quicker)


[06-May-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but I've been running all over the map since day 2...hauling contracts...


[06-May-24 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	that's the single biggest difference between a free license and pro - the added revenue stream and opportunities that arise from player-to-player contrats


[06-May-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dalinard**:	@LonelyRats 😂


[06-May-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@Dalinard also consider ALE production (on Sand with a FER) to eat up some GRN.  GRN itself is one of the easiest things to sell surplus of (NUT / VEG is the most difficult... BEA is easy because there are so few people doing ALG or MUS based RAT production).  HCP isn't hard since its got some other uses ... but most of HCP goes to C.


[06-May-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... I'll also note that during my first 2 months of play, 2/3 of the revenue that I got was from shipping contracts.  ... Or another way of looking it it... for every 1 NCC I got from selling stuff I made on Verdant, I got 2 NCC from shipping things from somewhere to somewhere else.


[06-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As for gov ... I'm not feeling any burnout.  I've got surplus that I can work with to restock things, its not eating into my reserves (and when it does, its amounts I can cover).  I don't fiddle with it - its a "I look at it on Sunday night and when POPR happens"


[06-May-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Right now, the costs of GRN.NC1 BEA.NC1 and VEG.NC1 are... they're wonky high.


[06-May-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT.NC1 , if you were to buy from the CX would cost 103 to make on Sand.


[06-May-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... ANd that's pretty close to break even.  So right now, if you can sell at those prices, go for it.


[06-May-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At 200 for each of BEA / NUT / GRN, RAT costs 78 NCC to make, and so the additional 30% profit on top of that is the "it is generally better to make RAT than sell raw agri."


[06-May-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	…how does that much from shipping work? Like, I’m producing about 3k of value in product and am waiting for it to accumulate before shipping it to market, once a week, so about 20k. How do you make 40k a week, on one trip every day, each costing about 3k in fuel? I’m honestly curious if I’m missing an element of the game here…


[06-May-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Shipping 100 GRN for 1000 adds 10 NCC of cost to each unit of GRN.


[06-May-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	If I fly from verdant to moria, for you hauling your goods to market for you, dropping them in your warehouse when I get there (I'm not buying your stuff, I'm just moving it)....at min fuel it's a 22 hour flight at about 2200 for fuel, you pay 5000, I profit 2800


[06-May-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	this is perhaps the element your missing...hauling others' stuff when you're not using your ships to haul your own stuff


[06-May-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Wut. BTF BP.STRT-0000 Test at full inventory tells me I need 34-37 hours.


[06-May-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got 200t that you're hauling of your own, and pick up 300t of other stuff for 3000 NCC, that means that hauling your stuff there is covered.


[06-May-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant -> MOR with full inventory at min reactor and default fuel is 1d 3h and 125 SF.NC1 + 91 FF.NC1


[06-May-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I get that, but the various contracts on the various LMs and such usually provide a profit of only 500 per round trip, or there’s no contract on the destination that’d lead me back. Though I’m probably too set in flying A-B-A instead of A-B-C-D-A...


[06-May-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	ok I was close, it's been a while since I've gone anywhere at min fuel - but I've stopped going full tilt and setting mid-night alarms


[06-May-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I typically run min reactor and default fuel ... unless its to get something from 11pm to 10pm.


[06-May-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm now more into long-term contractual hauling - fixed rates, less stress of finding those random jobs on the LM


[06-May-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	which is good, especially as my own base grows and I need to be able to haul that out more often


[06-May-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, contractual as in private contracts, not open for everyone?


[06-May-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Knowing that you've got something to haul is really nice.  There's a lot of spots where there's needed capacity but putting things up on the LM that never get picked up is awkward for shippers too.


[06-May-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	@G yes...not listed on the LM, direct contracts


[06-May-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Got it.


[06-May-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(when I put 500t of GRN to haul to Sand, it means that I can't pick up 500t of it myself since doing that would mess up autoprovision and that just sucks for the hauler)


[06-May-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but that only comes after having been super active the first few weeks and folks realizing my reliability...


[06-May-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On the other side of the market, its cheaper to contract out than to buy a new ship.


[06-May-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Oh yeah, hate that....only had that problem once, yesterday


[06-May-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm getting a new LCB ship... costs about 6.75M for the way I have it configured.  It would take about 4 years to pay that off with doing 10 NCC/t hauling.


[06-May-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, I just found out ships cost like 4M. that’s a lot.


[06-May-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	he finally provisioned, 8 hours after I requested termination and the ship had left


[06-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	he still hasn't responded to mail


[06-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Depends on the ship... I potentially went overboard on the config for the ship... putting a HPR and RHP in there.


[06-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HPR.NC1


[06-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Aaah! Now I get the delay. There’s auto provision and manual provision for contracts!


[06-May-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I was wondering why, after accepting a contracts, I had to wait for a time before the shipping container was provided.


[06-May-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	most folks auto-provision....that enabled me to sign contract, rent a warehouse local and fulfill pick-up before I even arrived....I would have fuel and load waiting so I could drop load, refuel and pick up, then get back on the "road"


[06-May-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Also enabled me to plan my route, and stage contracts for like 2-3 days...


[06-May-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just keep track of where and when you're going.


[06-May-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Stage as in as I described, A-B-C-A location wise?


[06-May-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	correct


[06-May-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Incidentally, If I rent a warehouse and cancel, is it or do I have the full week I paid for?


[06-May-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but I would have contracts waiting at those destinations - you just have to plan plan plan...so you ensure you can deliver all of them on time


[06-May-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	*is it immediate cancellation


[06-May-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	immediate cancellation


[06-May-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah. And what about my (possible) stuff stored in the warehouse?


[06-May-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	once I stopped hauling for a while week or so ago, I dropped my far off wh's


[06-May-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	especially the ones that had fees


[06-May-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but you don't have to do that....because the contract once provisioned will hold the stuff until you pick it up....I  mainly did that so I knew I had fuel waiting as well


[06-May-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and allow for flexibility and make sure I didn't forget anything - because once you launch, aborting flight is very costly in time and fuel


[06-May-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I think I learned that right before my first contract for shagie


[06-May-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm always happy to have haulers.  The LCB I'm going to make should help a bit with the VSF (Verdant Sand Frost) route and allow me to shift my WCB to hauling goods to/from Bastion system.


[06-May-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I was looking at Bastion-a potentially for a base....though it's a few down the list.


[06-May-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Bastion system is where it really starts getting interesting.


[06-May-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I was thinking to branch out a little more locally first (here in the YI sector)


[06-May-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	TIO from Bastion-a to Bastion-b (Titan) where you can toss it in a SME.  Put a CHP there too and you can make your own FLX for SIO to SI.  Put a GF on B and you've also got SIO + NA to GL.  ... and so on.


[06-May-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A poly plant on YI-705c is one of my more profitable bases.


[06-May-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I was contemplating going for Sand for hauling, but there’s no contracts on LM outbound :/


[06-May-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XIT FIN says that my most profitable world is currently Verdant (but that's 3 permits).  ... And then YI-705c doing just CL, EPO, and PG at 85k and 1 permit.  Then Circe doing LABs and 1 permit at 81k.


[06-May-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	And it’s still odd that LM shipping contracts are only on one of the respective locations.


[06-May-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The "no outbound from Sand" is because it takes in more than it creates ... and as its often a place for people to haul to, any outbound legs are quickly picked up.


[06-May-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(across 5 different goods, I only have 385t of stuff to haul at this time there)


[06-May-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, I figured something like that, but good to hear the confirmation.


[06-May-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or scheduled privately when you take a contract to haul there


[06-May-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Part of that is because I don't have reliable haulers from Frost to Sand ... I haul water in... and then that means that I am there and I can pick up everything I need to ship out without issue.


[06-May-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	alot of time, you'll find outbound contracts on the cx exchange as well for a number of planets


[06-May-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, makes sense. Never fly empty and all that.


[06-May-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If more people hauled Frost to Sand, I wouldn't need to visit Sand as often (myself) and would have more use for 3rd party logistics there.


[06-May-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Wut. Shipping/hauling contracts on the CX?


[06-May-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also... the imbalance kicks in.  RAT is 2t : 1m3 ... and so if I pay by the t, I'm only getting "half" the hauling capacity compared to if I haul it with a WCB.


[06-May-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	LM MOR


[06-May-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	oooh, yeah, I check those.


[06-May-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Oh man... that's a painful one to haul. 496t / 63m3 for 2k (in system)


[06-May-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... however, if you had a LCB you could pick up 6x of those and make a good bit on that.


[06-May-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	LCB and WCB are ships in various sizes by context. LCB is bigger in volume capacity. WCB is…?


[06-May-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	bigger by weight


[06-May-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I googled the abbreviations in context with Prun, but all I found were earnings reports of/within prun…


[06-May-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	large cargo bay and wide cargo bay


[06-May-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	1000/3000 and 3000/1000 respectively


[06-May-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Okay, thanks.


[06-May-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	MCB is medium, 1000/1000, LCB is 2k/2k...confusing myself


[06-May-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	check the blu


[06-May-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	lcb 2/2, hcb is thew volume 1/3


[06-May-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The WCB can hold 3000t and 1000m3.  This is useful for things like RAT (2.1 : 1) and C (2.25 : 1) where you can fill up the 1000 m3 space and have more than 2000 t being hauled.


[06-May-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	medium is 1/1


[06-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	we have the default small 500/500


[06-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(this also gets into CQT.NC1 vs CQS.NC1 and FTL speed discussions)


[06-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	gotta run to town


[06-May-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The SCB, MCB and WCB are smaller (by volume) ships and so only need a CQT.  Larger ships need a CQS (or even a CQM) which can add a lot to the price.


[06-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, that makes sense


[06-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Wait... got that slightly wrong.  But there is "keep it small to save"


[06-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't have in system haulers as WCB (even though I'm hauling FE) because that moves the in system hauler from a CQT to a CQS.


[06-May-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Going from a starter with a CQS to a (hypothetical) upgrade of a LCB means replacing the CQS with a CQM.NC1


[06-May-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And while the CQM isn't much more expensive than a CQS, it still means _replacing_ it which changes a ~500k NCC upgrade to a ~2M NCC upgrade ... and at that point you're probably better off buying a new ship.


[06-May-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The largest cargo that the CQS that the starter ship provides is the MCB or WCB ... and the WCB is better than the MCB in every respect - especially if you ever pick up RAT, C, or FE.


[06-May-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Wait. WCB was 1k/3k, right? How is that better for RAT, C, or FE, since they’re all comparatively high density? Or was WCB the 3k/1k?


[06-May-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	I use my WCB ship to move O from here and Ore from my mining base back down to Vallis for processing


[06-May-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	its 3k weight 1k volume


[06-May-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	it can fit 200 O, 400 ALO, and 250 FEO all together its awesome


[06-May-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	WCB is 3000 t / 1000 m3.  You can fit 1000 C in a WCB.


[06-May-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can only fit 888 C in a LCB with 2000 / 2000.


[06-May-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	saving up credits to upgrade my other starting ship then ill really be moving


[06-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and on the "why no 3rd party shipping out of Sand" - just had a ship that was delivering some HER and HOP ... and it picked up all my exports at 405t of stuff. ... and so now I've got nothing I need to ship out from there for a bit.

[06-May-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	thank you. i mean i am so new that my account isnt even an hour old.  i used to play OGame and ASTROEMPIRES but decided to get something a bit more complicated.


[06-May-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	well, you can't burn beans so thats going to sit for a minute


[06-May-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but you need water to grow crops on the farm...do you have any building materials left?


[06-May-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	no, all i got is water fuel and rations. But if im reading this contract right, after i make these beans i will be able to pick up my first set of building mats to get the process started.


[06-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	ok, so you're following the tutorial then...good, keep doing that.


[06-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	lowest we have seen the player count is like i think 170, then again depends on the time of day. if a person likes eve or another in depth game its more than likely up their street. there is a decent playerbase as well. small but its there

[06-May-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	i got one order placed for the carbon but should i save those?


[06-May-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	carbon you sell


[06-May-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	unless you have smelters that need it


[06-May-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	not the hydro plants?


[06-May-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	you burn the HCP to make the C to sell, from what i can tell


[06-May-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	unless you have a massive excess of plants dont sell them


[06-May-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	alright.  i am barely a hour into game. first time player.


[06-May-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	me too.  only been on about an hour, myself


[06-May-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah, burn hcp, grn or mai (youll swap to a frm recipe that produces the most goods for the least amount of water in the shortest time frame) to make carbon. from there youll fly it down to moria station, open up the element tab in the exchange, select carbon and sell for the price you want (look at what its being sold for, aim around that region, the red area not the green)


[06-May-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	that's the part i'm a bit confused on.  when i try to do what you just stated, it won't let me select a storage location


[06-May-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	you have nothing there


[06-May-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	the carbon physically has to be at moria station either on a ship or in a warehouse at the station


[06-May-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	trust me we have all been in the same boat as you in the past


[06-May-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	oh, i'm sure.  that's why i don't mind asking


[06-May-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im an old player, like a few months off three years old


[06-May-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	justfigured out how to change order from one recipe to another.  I see what you mean by MIA, GRN and HCP.


[06-May-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah its new order and then the resoucre you want to burn/make


[06-May-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	what do you have set up currently


[06-May-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	would it be worth my time and money to buy the stuff to make a second incinerator?


[06-May-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	whats the burn time


[06-May-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	i got 1 order gotg both beans and carbon going.  i will be back in about 15 mins.  got a call i need to take.


[06-May-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ie how long does it take to do an order


[06-May-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	4 C in 27 hours


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	how large are you doing these orders


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	maxium is an order size of 20


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	the smallest i could


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	so 1


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	yes


[06-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aight


[06-May-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	famr should be able to keep up if your running min orders


[06-May-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	farm*


[06-May-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	as long as you aint producing  mai you can run grn or hcp, although id swap to the 4 h2o - 4 grn recicpe as soon as possible


[06-May-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	water is the other thing...can i get it myself or do i have to buy it?


[06-May-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	rigs


[06-May-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	get the stuff for a rig as soon as possible


[06-May-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	can tell you now i have a load running... 10 to be exact


[06-May-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	ok, so i need 12 BSE and 40 MCG...buy it from the exchange?


[06-May-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yep


[06-May-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	construction prefab tab and construction material tab


[06-May-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	so, my ship has to already be at Moria for me to do this?


[06-May-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For you to load it, yes.  I'd strongly recommend renting a warehouse at moria station to make inventory management there easier.


[06-May-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	buying from station no, itll just be held in contact at the station till you can pick it up


[06-May-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	but yeah rent a warehouse out. for 500m3/500t its like 100ncc a week


[06-May-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	how do you rent a warehouse?


[06-May-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	WAR MOR --- it only costs 100 NCC / week and makes it easier to see what you've got and what you need to load.


[06-May-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	nevermind...found it


[06-May-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im spending nearly 1k a week on warehouses at moria


[06-May-24 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	though with how much i shift i might need to up it


[06-May-24 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 20 units there because it sometimes fills up.  Right now using 7031 t and 4878 m3.


[06-May-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i might jump it to 8000/8000


[06-May-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	ok, i bought the stuff and it's in my warehouse...how do i get my ship there to pick it up?


[06-May-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Most of it is 5k of MCG ... also got 448 C and 15k SF...


[06-May-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i need C ironicly but im broke atm lol cause i dumped nearly 850k into paying off the 3.2m loan i had


[06-May-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	paid off 2 weeks with that


[06-May-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	thank god im not scrambling to find crap to sell hahaha, finding enough to make 400k plus intrest per week was annoying


[06-May-24 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	Blacksail, why would you switch to the 4 H2O > 4 GRN instead of the 2 H2O > 4 HCP?


[06-May-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	alright im back.


[06-May-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	welcome back...i'm watching paint dry


[06-May-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I've been making mass amounts of C and stashing it on the market, I had 20 warehouse units full too but it was mostly that


[06-May-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	oh god lol


[06-May-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	also is there a way to speed up the production times?


[06-May-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Coffee and other lux consumables.


[06-May-24 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COGC industry alignment.  Verdant is agricultural - so your farms get a 25% bonus here.  Moving FP (food processor - food industry ) to a food industry world (Sand) would speed that up (and make more room for FRMs)


[06-May-24 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Experts.  As you run an industry, experts show up.  A full set of agri experts gives another 28% bonus to speed.


[06-May-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Faction (kind of).  You are (like me) HQ'ed in the outer reaches faction - not actually part of Neo (or any of othe others).  We get a bonus to resource extraction (and chem and fuel).  That speeds up your rigs a little bit based on unused permits (this advantage goes down as you get more bases)


[06-May-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Promitor in Insisitor gets the agri and food industry bonuses.


[06-May-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	agentdoug look at the difference in time it takes to produce the same amount of product. grn is faster to produce than hcp and offers the largest profit margins when producing carbon


[06-May-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and more production buildings.  More FRMs make more agri.  Not a bonus to the rate, but 2 FRMs will make 2x more than 1 FRM.


[06-May-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I run GRN(4) here rather than GRN(1) because I need more GRN and the 9h base vs 12h base time makes a difference.  On Harmonia and Proxion I do GRN(1) to keep water inputs down.


[06-May-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeap, verdant is pretty well stocked with water to allow those more water hungry production chains to keep up


[06-May-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN(4) costs 70 NCC to make.  GRN(1) costs 60 NCC to make.


[06-May-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	cost per grn if you do the 4 one makes it come out to about... 17.5ncc


[06-May-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	compared to grn one your costing about 3.42 less

**LonelyRats**:	guys guys. lets not argue about grains when there are Beans to grow,


[06-May-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(ahh... a bean cultist)


[06-May-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	we waint


[06-May-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	aint*


[06-May-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	im all about them grains.


[06-May-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	gain them grains, ya hear?


[06-May-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LonelyRats**:	Praise be onto the Bean, for its glossy shine will light the way, and the holy high fiber shall cleanse our body of sins in a tangible way.


[06-May-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	preach lol


[07-May-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COGC is covered for the next cycle.  I'll be looking to restock SST and INF (if you pull up POPI YI-715b and look at the upkeep for the safety station and infirmary.


[07-May-24 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, I'm going to be looking for about 1000 TUB.NC1 and would willing to pay 200 each in lots of at least 100 units (payable on delivery).


[07-May-24 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i can do 200xTUB in Vallis with my 2xGF. 1 day to produce but need 3-4 days total to haul myself. if its ok. Logistics is a bit thin right now.


[07-May-24 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	also can do the rest 800xTUB.


[07-May-24 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Thanks for the advice yesterday @Shagie. I'll keep all that in mind !


[07-May-24 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Shagie is currently offline, but does anyone know where the screenshots of the "cost of goods manufactured" a little earlier in the conversation come from? Is it a public site that can be accessed?


[07-May-24 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaei**:	prunplanner


[07-May-24 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Okay, I found the website. Thanks, kaei !

[07-May-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@illuineru send me the contracts with the delivery windows you can make.  I've got a month before that supply runs out.  Getting the contracts on the books means that I can keep track of the finances better.


[07-May-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@Dalinard Within Prun Planner ( https://prunplanner.org/ ) when doing the production of a good, given everything else is set up too (CX settings) the blue 'chart' button at the bottom of each section shows the cost of goods manufactured.


[07-May-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also, once you have prun planner set up... and you use PMMG you can do xit planner and get it as a panel within the screen.


[07-May-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	I've just finished setting up. It's just incredible as a tool... It's going to change my life :)


[07-May-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Yes, thanks for the PMMG info. I already use it. It's great too! I'll add a workspace for prun planner.


[07-May-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing that I do is use that to have a side by side "ok, I need this, I've got that..." to verify that what I have in prun planner matches what I have in game.


[07-May-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Contracts accepted and entered into the ledger)


[07-May-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Okay, I see. That's a good idea. I'll try to integrate it into my main dashboard if I can make some room for it.


[07-May-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got it in another screen altogether.


[07-May-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That screen is a two column layout - 75% on the right is prun planner.  25% on the left is Moria warehouse, my list of bases (BS) and CX NC1 in the bottom.


[07-May-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Okay! I'll try that or put it on the left sidebar. That's where I had originally placed my spreadsheet. I'll see what I prefer in practice.


[07-May-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	I admit that I quite like your proposal


[07-May-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	I don't have pro, so can't do contracts. But I do like the idea of buying as much as possible to supply the planet upkeep from those living here


[07-May-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im running 11 screens here lol


[07-May-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm at 16...though there's some redundancy in there.


[07-May-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Haha, I have plenty too. I enjoy testing configurations. The interface is really nice to use.


[07-May-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ive got one for storage, one for lm, three starter ones, a burn one (fio) comms one, two corp ones and an order one


[07-May-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@ZahnP in the green name discord chat channel with devs I've been a strong proponent of having govs set a buy price for COGC and POPI upkeep that _anyone_ could sell into (not done through contracts).


[07-May-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Not sure if that feature will be there... but its something that I point out its advantages each time it comes up.


[07-May-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	Its a good idea too, it opens up for production of goods locally or close, that many might not look at, because demand is difficult to judge


[07-May-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The demand is kind of know though... for example... pull up YI-715b


[07-May-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	From there click on "Population Infrastructure" and you'll get the info about all the buildings builet, what their level is and what the upkeep supply for them is.


[07-May-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Since we only need PIO and SET and a few TEC, safety station and infirmary are the two post important.


[07-May-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	that part I know about, but currently I can only sell to cx, regardless of what demand is here


[07-May-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you click on details for one of them - for example, the safety station, it will show DW, OFF< and SUN being used.


[07-May-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	if a contractless option was avalible, I could always make something for the planet, knowing I never needed to move it


[07-May-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Right - and I'd like to be able to have it so that you could make DW here and sell it into the SST at... say... a fixed price of 75 or so.  Not as good as shipping it to the cx, but still a nice profit compared when making it locally.


[07-May-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	excactly, benefit to both parties


[07-May-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	something like this will also, most likely, lead to less management needed for the Governor in charge


[07-May-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	the start up is super slow huh?  i have 1 day+ to the nearest commodity port.


[07-May-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	it takes a bit to fly to the cx yes, bit more planning needed when living out here


[07-May-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	thats normal unless you jack up your fuel sliders but i would highly advise against that


[07-May-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	im just worried about my DW as im consuming 5.7 a day to survive and again, i just started.


[07-May-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	how many dw you got


[07-May-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	he's U, so no direct local sales


[07-May-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	otherwise it would be easy, plenty of folks here that could sell you DW


[07-May-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	54 and sinking but with the new account and a day of travel time one way, my colony will probably fizzle out due to not being able to overcome the basic costs and economy demand just to make bottom line


[07-May-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	youve got about 9.5 days left


[07-May-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	54 is a 9 day supply...


[07-May-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	plenty of time


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i keep a 10 day supply at all times on my verdant base


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the game is generally slow and it takes a while to get places, but 9 days is a long time to plan for that


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, wait 5 days fill your ship and do the trip, then you will be back before running out


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	yes but im making BEA and GRN and turning them into C as fast as possible to sell but that is a day of travel and got to take fuel costs into consideration.


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	cut out bea and focus on grn


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	at a day each way, it's minimal fuel


[07-May-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	i will definately do that, first goal is to simply stablize my economy.


[07-May-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	main thing i want to due is simply build a RIG just so i save costs on H2O.


[07-May-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RIGs on Verdant are nice.  Its one of the cheapest water sources in the area.


[07-May-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	how exactly do i get the resources to build a RIG?  just sell carbon and buy my first components?


[07-May-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yep


[07-May-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	cx will have everything you need


[07-May-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	keep in mind that the planet has a small production fee, every time you start a job, so don't spend everything


[07-May-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	alright. im 10 hoyurs out with 2 BEA and 1 BBH


[07-May-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	how far did you set the fuel sliders


[07-May-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	25% fuel and MIN reactor


[07-May-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	dont do that


[07-May-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	leave reactor at min and fuel only a few ticks above min, aim for a day 6-4 hours travel


[07-May-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll second that.  Rarely do you need to get somewhere faster.  Put each unit of fuel costing 15 NCC (actual costs + eventual repair costs) for the "how much to spend on getting there",


[07-May-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	I will keep that in mind for the future.  i am still trying to get the hang of things.


[07-May-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For my current route, that's 146 SF and 29 FF.  If I set the fuel to 25%, that's 377 SF and 29 FF.  ... is 8h "worth" 3500 NCC?


[07-May-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... especially since it would mean instead of getting in at 8am, it would be getting in at midnight... and I won't do anything with it for another 8h.


[07-May-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	only time I'll use extra fuel is if the ship ends up reaching the destination when I'm sleeping. If not I just run both on minimum, making the trip be 1 day 16 hours


[07-May-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i dont care if a ship lands while im sleeping, ill just leave it till i get on


[07-May-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	depends on what I'm bringing too ofc


[07-May-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	usually its not important, so it will be a max time trip


[07-May-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	is there actual combat in this game?


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	no


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	its baiclly eve without combat


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	basiclly*


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	alright so i dont have to worry about that aspect.  Just profit only.


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	market pvp only, although I'm too small of a fish to take part in that


[07-May-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	be warned markets can change very quickly, be ready to adapt quickly


[07-May-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	I will look into expanding as soon as possible.  im still in the red so i need to stabilze first.


[07-May-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	shagie remember when that guy crashed the water market


[07-May-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i remember when the oxygen market crested then crashed, crested again then crashed once more


[07-May-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	interesting, I thought the market was too stable to crash, there must be some very wealthy people out there


[07-May-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There have been market shenanagins.  Pull up CXPC C.NC1 and look back at the last week of November.  It made things awkward, but not impossible.


[07-May-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	yeah made it a right pain


[07-May-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and as a C producer, I didn't mind the price at 1000 for a few days)


[07-May-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i remember when rat first hit like 150 for the first time


[07-May-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That was last August.  Someone pegged the buy/sell price for RAT at 150.  Had a sell order at 150, and a buy order at 149 and were slowly giving away money to people who created RAT ... but it was annoying for everyone else.


[07-May-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	made bank when that happened lol


[07-May-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	im happy its semi stable now


[07-May-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	LST.CI1 is another one with some shenanagins.


[07-May-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That one is almost off the 90 day charts.

[07-May-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	htf did it get to ten mil


[07-May-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea I bought some at 176, its been 200+ since


[07-May-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	ah someone drained the cx of all its lat


[07-May-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	lst*


[07-May-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	The issue with sand set me back about two weeks, bit annoying, not losing money because of it just slowing progress


[07-May-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	i need to start prepping that base


[07-May-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	means i can shift more production to farming and rigs on verdant


[07-May-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	well you got a few weeks before more workers are avalible there


[07-May-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	time to build capital then


[07-May-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blacksail**:	since im in reserves currently


[07-May-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea, I put 450k in sand only to find out making 200 rat took 400 days


[07-May-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	because no workers were avalible


[07-May-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	and I build the hq a few days before the food processors, because I had a mix of materials in the first ship but not all I needed


[07-May-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	good lesson to learn early though

**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	7 hours till my first units of C are complete.


[07-May-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That number - the 21 - that represents how many workers you can draw from the unemployed workforce this cycle.


[07-May-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If that number is smaller than the number in parens, hold off on building the building this cycle.


[07-May-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	yea I know that now :)


[07-May-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I had that happen once too...  making sure that others aware aware of the workforce number when building out.


[07-May-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	my real surprise was that the 200 workers from the core module did not stay mine, because I did not have all the materials and had to build the production a few days later, they went to work for someone else :D


[07-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	i already am in love with this game, i just need a way to speed up my FRM.


[07-May-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ada_1s_Creamy_USB_Port**:	10 hours for 4 GRN?  insanely slow.


[07-May-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	5h11n and 6h55m for me.  Agri experts and coffee.


[07-May-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I see that I can have up to 5 experts in a category, and up to 6 active overall in my base. So I’m wondering (1) how do I increase the respective maximum, both for category and global, (2) can I have more experts available across the categories than the maximum of active experts? It’s implied, but better to verify. (3) Moving experts from planet to planet isn’t possible, they’re always locally trained, right?


[07-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZahnP**:	experts cannot be moved between planets, they are local only. 6 experts max per base, you gain them by having production in any given category, the more buildings you have with active production, the faster you will gain experts

**shagie**:	You need a collective 915 days of industry time to have 5 experts (yea, that 5th one takes a while).


[07-May-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have 20 FRMs, that's only 45 days.


[07-May-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Good, good.


[07-May-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	I’m about to set up my next FRM. I also have the material for another FP, but didn’t realise I’ll be short 10 pioneers.

***Refugee** joined.*


[07-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Nice balance, FP uses resources very slightly faster than FRM produces them (less than 30m/d), so by adjusting it down 1 expert 1 slightly overproduce instead, building a bit of a buffer and having no one twiddling their thumbs.


[07-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Wait, no, I’m an idiot, forgot the DW, buffer will naturally accrue.

**shagie**:	The POPR hit and we're at a comfortable 13% unemployment for PIO and 28% for TEC.  PIO hapiness is at 81% meaning that when this festivals III is over, it should remain at 61% which means no migration out.


[08-May-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Wait.. that was _AGO_ ... well, 6d 23h ago.  Ok... 1 more hour.


[08-May-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	adding 100 PIO in the next couple days...no worries.


[08-May-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There we go... ok... 20% PIO unemployment (good).  55% happiness (need to work on that).  41% tech unemployment (did someone move out for ORC?)


[08-May-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm ok with tech at this time... and that's manageable if I need it.  Still would like more PIO happiness (55%) so I'm losing slightly... still in the comfortably manageable range though, though no migration out.


[08-May-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The threshold for decline is 50% (we're at 55%)


[09-May-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Argonautis**:	Hello I established a farm base here a few days ago. For now 😄 ta T1 but I would like to upgrade/expand if there is a Corp that could support me.


[09-May-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're going to have a difficult time getting support without a pro license, direct player to player support requires contracts.


[09-May-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	I am going to get a pro soon, maybe next week. Is there a long target that I should be focusing for this base?


[09-May-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Verdant runs an Agri CoGC, so that's a 25% efficiency boost...likely want to focus in that category to maximize profits.


[09-May-24 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Is it worth to have my next expand as Hydroponic Farms or there snt


[09-May-24 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Isn't a big market for a free license on those products?


[09-May-24 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	think I'm going to let shagie handle these questions...I'm not exactly running an optimized program myself


[09-May-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HYFs rather than FRMs are useful if you have an abundance of water available and can import NS (since we can't make that here).  It tends to be a step "up" after you fill all your space and still want more production.  But they're _thirsty_.


[09-May-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also, since they don't get bonus (or need) from soil fertility, they tend to be better placed on worlds that have low fertility, near water.  I'm looking at putting some on XG-326c


[09-May-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FRMs are much easier to tend ... and FRM agri is easier to sell since its more widely used.  You can sell GRN.NC1 more easily than MAI.NC1 and the BEA.NC1 cult has advantages over ALG.NC1 and MUS.NC1 (do you know anyone who uses ALG / MAI / VEG for their RAT?)


[09-May-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	how do you do a planetary survey contract exactly?  do i have to make a surface landing?


[09-May-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes, land, and while on the planet, fulfill contract


[09-May-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	thank you


[09-May-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	very critical, you must be on the planet to click fulfill


[09-May-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

I kind of read about the HYF being thirsty and not needing soil fertility but for some reason it never registered on my brain when I was thinking about expansion. Glad to have asked here before I made an expensive mistake.


[10-May-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ugh. Bought and brought BDE instead of BBH for the base expansion, and since I didn’t check from the base specific tile, I didn’t account for the additional MCG *at all*. 🤦🏻‍♂️


[10-May-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	Hello @Geraldivar, I sent you a DM. I have some stock that I'm not using (not much). I'm offering it to you a bit more expensive than the market price, but I can give it to you directly on Verdant (no transportation fees). Feel free to contact me again if you're interested. Have a good day!

[10-May-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dalinard**:	I admit I've somewhat pushed the LM buying and selling out of my mind. Since it's generally empty, and I thought we'd all be doing something similar here, or at least with FRM, I didn't think it was something worth considering.


[10-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats where you'll find shipping contracts


[10-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and most folks here are doing farming


[10-May-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Grow it here and process it XG-430c


[10-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Calibrate**:	What's special about that planet? Besides the habitability


[10-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	COGC is Food,


[10-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Calibrate**:	Ah, I see


[10-May-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Otherwise not too much, nice distance from Moria CX where my stuff is centered


[10-May-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Calibrate**:	That makes sense


[10-May-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so is Midway-sand and its closer is it not


[10-May-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yes and no, I am also on XG-430b which is habitable and has COGC Manufacturing


[10-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Calibrate**:	Are there any local COGCs that specialize in Resource Extraction


[10-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Several, Prism in OT-889, also XG-452f (H/AR), there is an AMM planet in Midway


[10-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Celebdil (ALO source) further away


[10-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Calibrate**:	Thanks!


[10-May-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	np, back to work  :-)


[10-May-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	The roundtrip Verdant → Sand → Moria → Verdant is ≈ 550 fuel, Verdant → XG-430c → Moria → Verdant ≈ 650, while the travel times differ only by about an hour.


[10-May-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my guess is he's no longer limited to a starter ship...


[10-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	can you mine for AUO on verdant?


[10-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	no, there are no minerals on verdant


[10-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just water and oxygen


[10-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	right...which is what i'm doing


[10-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's also got an agri cogc, so 25% boost to agri buildings efficiency


[10-May-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	actually, farms and incinerators.  Grow it, and then immediately set it on fire.


[10-May-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	seems weird


[10-May-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if your hq is here, you get a boost to extraction as well (so incinerator, rig, collector)


[10-May-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	oh, and collectors for O.  Really all I'm doing is polluting this place to feed the smelters back on Vallis.


[10-May-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	said that


[10-May-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	what do you need in order to start a new base?


[10-May-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Somewhat depends on the planet. Go to a planet of your choice and select start base.


[10-May-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	The tile lists all the material you need to establish a base there.


[10-May-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Geraldivar**:	Also, look at the Popi to see if there’s workers available. You can have an empty or understaffed factory, the workers will still consume and produce, at lower efficiency.


[10-May-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and you'll want to compare your new planet profile to this list of extra building costs - as they will apply to all buildings you put there: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/building-costs/index.html#costs-calculation

**Retread**:	If you do bring components for buildings beyond the core module, be sure to bring consumables and raw materials to feed your workers and machines for a few days.


[10-May-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I priced out starter bases on several planets last week, lowest was like 350k (just for mats)


[10-May-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I just finished building out my third base on XG-430c, and they've run from 800k to 1.1M so far.  I built them in 3-4 stages with the first stage usually the most expensive, so 350k is a good estimate for a base with pioneer and settlers buildings.


[10-May-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DonRoman**:	Is buying COF worth it? My consumption is now 1.1 / day.


[12-May-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it means an 13% increase in productivity


[12-May-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	with just basic consumables (dw rat ove) you're at 79%...cof adds ~13%, pwo another 8%


[12-May-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	In other words, CXP COF.NC1 . The population consumes 0.5 COF per 100 PIO. If the increase in income/production exceeds the expense of about 750 NCC, you’re golden.


[12-May-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	In other words, if you can produce, I dunno, 3 GRN.NC1 more per day by buying 1 COF, then you’re making more than it costs.

**shagie**:	Tax collection this week was 321,150 NCC.  This is 4.99% more than last week and continues the natural tax growth of about 5% / week.  This will be more than enough to cover COGC.  POP Report in 3d 21h - currently have 20% PIO unemployment and 55% happiness - which is enough to not have migration out.  Tech unemployment (from last week) is 41%.


[12-May-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Next POPR restockings will be for the Safety Station - OFF, SUN, and DW with some need in ~20 days for that.  My own base on Circa is spinning up more capacity and should be able to handle the OFF and SUN without issue (I'll be supplying them to the planet at current BID (green) prices though if others are interested in supplying - contact me).

**bobnobrain**:	I do sometimes


[13-May-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I ship in some NS, accumulate some extra water, build a single HYF and let it eat through the resources I have


[13-May-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Then I just disassemble it :)


[13-May-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Huh. Is there a loss in building materials between construction and disassembly?


[13-May-24 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	usually


[13-May-24 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	how much is determined by how much use it gets/time


[13-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I believe it depends on building condition, and this depletes even when the building does not produce anything


[13-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But yeah, I have to import additional building mats to account for that loss


[13-May-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lossaria**:	if you're ever up for selling a bit bob :')


[13-May-24 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, I am still a free player, so this is probably not gonna happen :) Although maybe I should crank up some additional CHP to get me more NS, import some water, and take advantage of those prices 🤔


[13-May-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Because right now I have a singular HYF, and it will yield me a total of 46 beans in like 3.5 days. Not a great volume to sell the extras :)


[13-May-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lossaria**:	It's alright ^.^, I'm just trying to integrate further supply lines to CI1 and AI1 that have much cheaper beans, so I'm running into short term production pauses

**AgentDoug**:	how do you sell things at the exchange?


[16-May-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	By placing sell orders with CXPO.  A good way of doing it is opening the exchange window itself (CX NC1, for example), and finding the mat you want to trade.


[16-May-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Next to each mat you'll see low contrast links for Info, Chart, Orders, and Trade.  Clicking on Trade will let you set what mat, how many units, and what unit price you want to offer them for sale.


[16-May-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	If you open the orders window, it'll show a listing of all currently open offers to buy (bids) and sell (asks).  If your selling price is equal to or less than that of the lowest ask price, the sale goes through immediately, otherwise you ask offer goes on the list with the rest of them.


[16-May-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

This was up 2% from the previous collection and resulted in a surplus (at that time) of 535k NCC.  COGC has been fully funded, the INF is at 40 days surplus now and I am in the process of addressing the Safety Station (DW at 10 days, OFF at 13, and SUN at 6).  I have 400 SUN and 1000 OFF on route ... and a bunch of DW too.   The TUB, OFF, and SUN represent 380k NCC of supplies, getting the planet surplus down to 50k NCC.

**shagie**:	The most important thing is it is not a job.  When part of a game becomes a _job_ the things you do in the game become tasks rather than enjoyment.  This is something that I've seen burn other governors out.  For me, I enjoy trying to make the numbers do what I want them to (within reason) and don't see the governorship as an income source.  To that end, my books are open and I try to make sure that people know what I'm doing.  I've phrased it before as "good will can not be bought."


[23-May-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	By having the open books and updates (that was something that I picked up from Alblaka when I became gov of Sand - he did it on the UFO sand politics channel) - though I go for even more openness for my books.

**Janelle1116**:	I'm constantly highlighting stuff that I shouldn't be able to (like dragging a product from one place to the other, and accidentally highlighting the text of it somehow).  That stays highlighted no problem, but the one thing I might want to highlight won't do it!


[23-May-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	(and my awful way of doing it previously was right clicking on it, inspecting element, and copying from the developer tool window -- OCR might have been better)

**shagie**:	This week's tax income was 334,600 NCC up 0.47% from last week (holding stable).  I've been restocking the SST and INF population infrastructure and since the last tax collection have spent 666,560 on POPI restocking.


[26-May-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COGC new inventory will be in 5 hours... and I've got many of the supplies for that already staged.


[26-May-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With the active restocking of Verdant's POPI, May has seen costs of approximately 305k NCC / week.  I'll have the final final numbers next week though this gets into a "spending isn't always aligned with calendar months."

But I was witness to @Blacksail admitting to the deed. No sir. No. No, I obviously don’t know what’s sarcasm. Yes. Yes. Yes, I guess. Tomorrow at 8am at the Safety Station. Got it.

Settlers had a net loss of 572 (this is about where I'd like it).  Techs had a net loss of 55 (again, about where I'd like it - I can run a program to get that number up if someone wants to build more ORCs than is currently unemployed)

Etymology of *spreadsheet* / an anachronistic use

[02-Jun-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This week's tax collection was 328,050.  This is 1.96% down from last week (this number is based on amount of _stuff_ made - not number of bases or employed workers, but stuff in queues).


[02-Jun-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As I've mentioned, I've been stocking filling up the POPI upkeep.  The Infarmary is stocked for 40 days (70 days of OFF, 45 days of TUB, and 40 days of STR).  The Safety Station needs a bit of DW and SUN (I'm shipping that in).  DW is at 15 days, OFF is at 43 days, and SUN is at 30 days.


[02-Jun-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Interesting.  I think I pay about 3000 NCC in production fees on Verdant per week for 8 COL / 4 FRM / 10 INC / 2 RIG.  There's 331 occupied plots, meaning the average tax paid per player is about 1000 NCC.  That would mean either that there's a lot of incomplete bases or a lot of inactive bases.  Or (probably) a mix of both.


[02-Jun-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Assuming the average complete base pays similar production fees to mine (3000), and the average incomplete base pays half that (1500), and that the number of complete and incomplete active bases are equal, it would require 72 active and 72 inactive bases to pay 324000 NCC in a week.


[02-Jun-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	That would mean (331-72-72) = 187 bases are inactive.  More than half.


[02-Jun-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm going with more incompletes.  You can get a "developed area %" when you click on a plot in the YI-715b planet screen.


[02-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Out of chance, first one I clicked on was Zen at PPI 48894d40


[02-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and that number means?


[02-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Next two were 11 days and 42 days old at 23% and 48% built.  280 days ... inactive player at 25%.


[02-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	its a buffer command...


[02-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's the unique plot identifier.


[02-Jun-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other thing to recall is that some plots are corp HQs ... and while they don't give me taxes directly, the 10% increased production means 10% faster ... and slightly more production fees.


[02-Jun-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The low taxes are low - but Verdant is humming along nicely for POPI and COGC funding.  I don't see raising taxes in the near future... though now that the INF is funded furhter out, gonna pay some attention to the INF ... but its still quite good for its outlook.


[02-Jun-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Overall, for May, Verdant was running at 385k NCC / week - and that's with me doing some significant restocking.


[02-Jun-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Low tier pops are super cheap. Then again, the planet is still developing. :)

How governments will work after the politics update
Hey everyone,  we are close to the release of our politics themed update. If you follow our dev logs you might already know a lot about the upcoming changes, but judging from discussions and comments on Discord and our test server there are a lot of open questions how everything is supposed to work after the release hits.  So here is a quick wri...

**sqish1**:	you are everytime welcome :-)


[03-Jun-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(as a side bit) when the gov update becomes imminent and if the production feels remain in effect I will be uping the fees to 15 across the board before hand to make sure that Verdant goes into governance accounting with a (hopefully) surplus on the budget.  I don't want to be in the situation where we'll have to fiddle raising taxes afterwards while COGC runs on donation only (because the coffers are empty).


[03-Jun-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I don't see any reason to raise them from 12 - the budget outlook still looks good at this time... though I keep working on nudging that PIO happiness up a tad bit more)


[03-Jun-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jun-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	correct, and it's a contract, which requires a pro license


[04-Jun-24 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Primaner**:	Ah ok just to give the Loan or also to take it ?


[04-Jun-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Either / both.  Player to player interaction requires a PRO license (or when the PRO license lapses it becomes a BASIC license where you can receive contracts but not create them)

[06-Jun-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	has multiple uses, can be used for RAT or can be burned in incinerators to make carbon


[06-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	With farming, you've basically got proteins (ALG/BEA/MUS), carbs (GRN/MAI), and fats (NUT/VEG).


[06-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your FP's will take one of each category for RATs, or 2 proteins + water for PPA (MEA inputs), or 2 grains and a fat for FOD (POPI upkeep).


[06-Jun-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	FERs will take GRNs for higher tier LUX consumables. CHPs will take VEG for more POPI upkeep stuff. LABs will take ALG for higher tier LUX consumables, and your INC will burn all the carbs + HCP for as much carbon as is profitably able.


[06-Jun-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most people, who build for I/O production specs, regarding any final product, will almost always have some sort of surplus that they eventually get rid of at the CX. For those that use the CX as an input source, they should expect this sort of behavior:


[06-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Low pop-tier regions usually burn through as much GRN/MAI/HCP as they can affordably do so, due to C demand. Should pop tiers advance to higher levels, then eventually you'll see more demand for the other 2 categories, which will drive up the prices.

[10-Jun-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They're big and awkward and have additional workforce requirements.... and you are stuck in the HOP.NC1 and GRA.NC1 markets.  ... Which while not bad are rather "that's what you're doing" ... and you _are_ making surplus (the HOP : FER ratio is a lot of FER)


[10-Jun-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you look at the 180d price chart for HOP.NC1 you can see when I decided to put down an ORC.


[10-Jun-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At 1000 NCC, HOP was break for selling on the market.  At 2500, I decided I wanted in on the supply side.  The awkward part is if you don't have the FER capacity to consume it, you can easily out produce the market.


[10-Jun-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Yea! 50.3% happiness for PIO.  That means we've got no migration out and it becomes much easier to manage the PIO unemployment.  The PIO -> SET education is still greater than the SET migration out and the SET -> TEC education is also greater than the TEC migration out.  This is all good.  Unemployment numbers are all in a comfortable place.


[12-Jun-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Looking at the SET and TEC graphs on the POPR you can see a gradual increase - which is much better to work with than the spiky changes.


[12-Jun-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	nice work, chief!

[13-Jun-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Aside from a number of TEC-based fabs getting disappeared/retooled back at the end of last year. It's just a long-cycle PIO management.

[13-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	not less then 1k


[14-Jun-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd never pickup anything less than 500 t/m3 ---> MOR, unless it was the only thing available.


[14-Jun-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LonelyRats**:	i tend to split ship so the space trucker can move their own cargo too, or they can take both for a full load


[14-Jun-24 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	thats right


[14-Jun-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@shagie can this planet go for a Resource Extraction COGC, for the extra slurp-slurp?


[14-Jun-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I ask since OT-580e is being developed for HYF activity, and this place is the nearest water hole. :D


[14-Jun-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LonelyRats**:	there a 500 ship split in 2, with no rush :D with a bit better than 1k/100t

[14-Jun-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@illuineru technically, no. I just need 13 people to vote actively on the COGC. :)


[14-Jun-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	@Roh, how about no - this is the only good fertile world in this area - we do need to grow HER and ORC stuff somewhere.  There are plenty of other places to get H2O from.  (yes, less efficient but almost all places can NOT use FRM/ORC)


[14-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@CraftsmanThirteen how about yes --- the only things determined with fertility are FRM:HER and ORC:PIB/HOP/GRA. You don't need significant water deposits for them either. This planet, however does have such a local resource, which meets HYF thresholds per my calculations. It's scarce, and the other possibilities within MOR space branchings are like : XG-452b and LG-418b (not exactly do-able for many).


[14-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You've got 2/3 of all universe-wide fertility that is suitable for HER/ORC production, rather than with anything more intensive due to their low water densitites. It's a simple calculation once people spread out enough. Idk how it'll look when it does come around though.


[14-Jun-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	My answer is still 'NO' - this is the only AG planet with fertility in Moria space - there are many H2O planets - your arguement is this place is more efficient - my arguement is there is NO other place for AG.


[14-Jun-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XG-452b creates water at a rather low COGC.


[14-Jun-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COGM rather.


[14-Jun-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	UV-796b, OT-580b, JS-952c, ZV-759c, OT-580c, OT-442b, AJ-768a, GY-110c, ZV-307d --- all suitable towards my point


[14-Jun-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of course, no COGC bonuses, but that's just the architecture of the dev work.


[14-Jun-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	YI-059a is a good candidate for water but no COGC. But hey u can get water there.


[14-Jun-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XG-452b is the fourth best water world in the game.


[14-Jun-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It has an A300 score of 1,490.17 while Verdant is 1,099.97


[14-Jun-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(A300 : What is the resource extraction for 300 area worth of resource extraction buildings and no other bonuses)


[14-Jun-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	YI-059a is a bad candidate due to the phase of the element on the planet. COL/EXTs get 1/2 of what a RIG can get, per hour, on same measures, iirc.


[14-Jun-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's even a food industry over there to do DW if that was your thing.


[14-Jun-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The point is that XG-452b can pump out water 50% faster than Verdant ... and its closer to Moria than Verdant.


[14-Jun-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ye, XG-452b is pretty good, however those without extra permits will want to/but cant, while those with permits will not want to/but can.


[14-Jun-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The best liquid water in the game has a resource factor of 0.77.  XG-452b is 0.70.  KW-688c is 0.60.


[14-Jun-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I would contend that the people who have built here have agri.


[14-Jun-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pull up YI-715b and tell me how many blue spots do you have to click on before you get one that is _not_ agri?


[14-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that would be an interesting question. Not going to do so. I did a survey for Avalon and it was a good find. Not everyone there is a FP base, but it really doesn't matter, does it? All that does is who has pro, and does COGC voting.


[14-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There are certainly some that are resource extraction ... I am moderately surprised at how many are there.


[14-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	it's why I asked. Verdant is the easiest water hole next to MOR CX.


[14-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Whatever the case, COGC isn't something that I control ... its something that the population on the planet controls.


[14-Jun-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	^^^


[14-Jun-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A hypothetical switch of Verdant to resource extraction would put me -100 GRN, -50 BEA, -50 VEG, -100 HCP per day.


[14-Jun-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I would run out of agri for Sand and Frost within two weeks.


[14-Jun-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	look at OT-580e.


[14-Jun-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	To which I again point you to XG-452b which has more water, cheaper water (than verdant), and is closer.


[14-Jun-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Cheaper? ~Maybe.


[14-Jun-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider $VLNS and look to see "does he have a base on Verdant?"


[14-Jun-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Can you think of someone who has a better understanding of where to get cheap water?


[14-Jun-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ah yes, our Lisan Al'Gaib.... I pointed him to other places, so probably not soon.


[14-Jun-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But he's had a plot on XG-452b for 220 days.


[14-Jun-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	@Shagie can i get a insight from you. im planning a water base. Which would be better for my bases etherwind or XG-326b ?


[14-Jun-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got a base on Proxion - the logistics of Etherwind -> Proxion are easier.


[14-Jun-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Additionally, you can join the Etherwind HQ corp and get a 10% bonus there.


[14-Jun-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes, join the EFIO.


[14-Jun-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll point out that you're also on Bastion a and Titan ... and you may find the logistics (despite lower water production) of Frost easier.


[14-Jun-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm building a base on Bastion c for HYFs ... and have a dedicated in system ship to move goods between A and B and C and D.


[14-Jun-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You may also find it easier to get 3rd party shipping off of Etherwind.


[14-Jun-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Thats what i wanted to hear. Was thinking a HYF base. But couldnt decide where to. Thank you.


[14-Jun-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	probably i will change proxion to HYF. and with a bse in etherwind would be good. but that still have time.


[14-Jun-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HYFs don't require fertility - you might want to look at some other options for HYFs that don't make use of the limited fertility resource.


[14-Jun-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Consider XG-326c - look at its fertility and its COGC.


[14-Jun-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Will do. Just a though. Planning for future. Not concrete yet. i have a about 35-40 bases planned at prunplanner.


[14-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I have dedicated in system ships in XH-594 QQ-001 and XG-326


[14-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They're cheap to make since they can use a CQT.NC1 rather than a CQS.NC1 and don't need a FTL drive.


[14-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	very different paths. Food. Metal. a bit manufactoring and electronics.


[14-Jun-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing is that I can deliver all my goods to XH-594b and pick everything up there ... and then let the in system hauler distribute goods to the other planets.


[14-Jun-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't need to do Moria - Kiruna - Moria - Libertas - Moria - Cortez


[14-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I can do Moria - Kiruna - Moria and have another (cheap) ship do Kiruna - Libertas - Kiruna - Cortez - Kiruna


[14-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	yep i have glass based STL ship planned as blueprint.


[14-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Do FSE rather than GSE.


[14-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FSE effectively doubles your fuel tank size and is cheaper to operate overall.


[14-Jun-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The only reason to use a GSE is if you want to make it yourself because you've got too much glass coming out of your GF.  Its worse in every other way.


[14-Jun-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Glass markets have rebounded, so yes it's worse if you're looking in the long term. You can make the engines yourself, but it'll take up a good stream of revenue from you.


[14-Jun-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	well GSE i can make now. FSE i have to wait others. but i ll keep your advice. future i can change it to FTL if needed.


[14-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I currently run all my ships with FSE because I don't want to be delivering SF there that often either.


[14-Jun-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Thank you for your advices.


[14-Jun-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah it's funny. Way back when, there was literally no STL/FTL market on the CXs. Lots of Bids, but no supply. It's changing now to be more fluid.

[17-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Tax income this week was 334,080 NCC.  This is up 1.6% from last week (holding steady).  COGC costs went up from last week (from 159,673 to 195,828).  This was mostly from an increase in the base count.  Last week had RAT (the lowest) at 514 units, this week it was at 606 units.  This weeks expenditures (including POPI) was 385,328 NCC.  Verdant is running a slight negative balance (this changes from week to week - last week I owed Verdant 7917 NCC, this week Verdant owes me 43,331).


[17-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats the one aspect of the starter I miss - Verdant -> MOR in under 13h


[18-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@bob - spec out a 250/250 cargo hold ship with a HPR and FTL tank large enough.  Then compare the max reactor flight time of that for Verdant to Moria ...


[18-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The HPR on a LCB ship is a "I'm spending lots of money, make it something that I don't want to refit later."


[18-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(7h for MOR to Verdant with HPR in a 250 at max reactor)


[18-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, but a 250 is kinda pointless


[18-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... also max reactor on a HPR fuel consumption is the same for 250 and 200.  This isn't cheaper, its faster)


[18-Jun-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats like strapping a jet pack to a fanny pack


[18-Jun-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That ship probably costs like my whole equity


[18-Jun-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You've got a few bases... the HPR isn't _that_ much more compared to a standard FTL engine for a new ship.


[18-Jun-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or a new gasworld base


[18-Jun-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Income statement says that i'm a bit below 9M, I guess that's not enough to afford more than one such ship (or any ship except something very basic), I suppose


[18-Jun-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	play with the blu and price it out....LCB fast runs about 8M, WCB (not an upgrade) about 6M


[18-Jun-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but you'd of course have to source that off the markets - shop around for the parts you need

**Roh**:	You don't.


[19-Jun-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Maybe you buy just 1 month of pro, to leverage the license conversions, if you stay in the game?  You could ask around, to secure loans to fund x2 WCB upgrades for your starter ships, but unless you ask around for potential opporunities, in terms of sponsored bases, you'll have a hard time.


[19-Jun-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The last time I checked, a full, 1-permit Carbon base was at like 25k net profit daily?  That'll take you like 2 months to pay out for such ship upgrades. I'd suggest asking around the UFO discord, for anyone interested in your thing.


[19-Jun-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most of the game revoles around nothing in here, rather:

**Roh**:	Read, not just look through, all of those links, and you'll have a good idea of where/whom to reach out to in like a few days?


[19-Jun-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	:D


[19-Jun-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Carbon is more profitable than that.  I split Verdant about equally between O and C, and I make about 55k a day off that base.


[19-Jun-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	A full C base on a resource extraction planet looks like it makes about 75k a day even if you buy the grain.


[19-Jun-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	my prism makes 150k wihtout buying grains.


[19-Jun-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	C on Frost was my second base for this reason.  It also means that you can take the profit on the spread of GRN.NC1 rather than paying it to someone else.


[19-Jun-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and GRN.NC1 with 2000 units buying at 280 and another 2000 at 270 and another 5500 at 255 ... ghads.  I recall when I was pricing it at 200.


[19-Jun-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	yeah everything gone to sky. even in HRT agri products gone up.


[19-Jun-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	wow didnt saw that in GRn.OB.


[19-Jun-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Farming isn't as much of a respected profession - people switch to other "higher alpha" ones which in turn puts the demand on C ... and agri.


[19-Jun-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	well if helps us. so "shrugs"


[19-Jun-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, the RAT.NC1 is continuously rising.


[19-Jun-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, it’s not, I just checked.


[19-Jun-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://fio.fnar.net/priceindices is a neat chart.


[19-Jun-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The consumable index tracks RAT / DW / OVE.  A higher price there benefits the victuallers.  The BFab price index benefits miners / constructors.


[19-Jun-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	can you deconstruct a building?


[19-Jun-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**illuineru**:	yes. in buildings tab of your base


[19-Jun-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	do you get the materials back?


[19-Jun-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	some, it lists a reclaimable materials


[19-Jun-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	i see


[19-Jun-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u build it mistakenly u have a grace priod of about 3 hrs to demolish and take back all materials.

**AgentDoug**:	i just got pro...how do recurring orders work?  i tried clicking the recurring option, but i don't see any visible way to make sure it's active


[19-Jun-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the orders in the queue will say recurring on them


[19-Jun-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	it won't even let me click the "queue order" button if "recurring order" is clicked


[19-Jun-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Are your queue is not full?


[19-Jun-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	correct...i deliberately cancelled an order to have a blank order on my collector open


[19-Jun-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	tried to create a recurring order for O and it won't let me click the 'queue order' button


[19-Jun-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Dİd you restart your browser after bought PRO?


[19-Jun-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	no


[19-Jun-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	sometimes transition is "broken". Force restart it


[19-Jun-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	that worked...i'm an idiot lol


[19-Jun-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	No worries. It happened to me also.


[19-Jun-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	i wish there was a way to sync all of my INC without having to wait for them all to finish.  it's just an OCD thing for me


[19-Jun-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	lol +1 to that. all my orders at given building finishes at the same time even different items.


[19-Jun-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	so, let me just see if i get this right, because it seems basic.  if i have 2 FRM, i only need 2 recurring orders, right?  5 INC = 5 recurring orders?


[19-Jun-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	no. If it will be the same products - you need 1 rec


[19-Jun-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	not necessarily. 1 recurring can fill all


[19-Jun-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can use two or more to make production one by one


[19-Jun-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	different products


[19-Jun-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	when recurring order goes to production its copy goes to the end of the queue.


[19-Jun-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	so if i had one FRM, i could make 3 rec orders for GRN, MAI and BEA and it would sequentially make those three items?


[19-Jun-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	for example my bundle for 5 farm - 3 grn + 1 bea + 1 nut


[19-Jun-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Right.


[19-Jun-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jun-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@AgentDoug some people point to places like the UFO discord, but I disagree on the principle.


[19-Jun-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Learn the in-game commands, like buffer [CMDS], as it will give you the knowledge for you to master your own destiny...


[19-Jun-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	spoiler: ..... you'll find a buffer command of the sort like [CORPS]  that will show you the entire active list, directly. You can then engage in spontaenous conversations with people from that. Although IMO, the best way to vibe-check is just to find active people in the chats, and then clicking on their user names, to their their association lists.


[19-Jun-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's lots of larpers in [CORPS], hehe.

**shagie**:	The dividend payout for this week is 344,050.  This is up 2.98% from last week of 334,080 and remains fairly consistent "not huge growth" (which is good).  There is net positive population growth for SET and TEC tiers from education while keeping the happiness less than 50% for them (so there is also migration out).  That helps keep it not too much growth up (which consumes POPI upkeep at a faster rate).


[23-Jun-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COGC is currently filled, and and I have the stocks ready for the next cycle. POPI upkeep remains well stocked with a month or more for the ones that I want to maintain, while STR and SUN are slowly running out (they're more expensive to maintain for the same goods).  I plan on restocking them if PIO happiness starts trending down again.

**Geraldivar**:	Management simplified? Or, rather, I’ll wait two weeks for you think your thoughts and offer a verdict :)


[26-Jun-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Management simplified? Maybe. There might be a lot of bickering and political conflict left and right.


[26-Jun-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	I've been messing around with the government motions and you can put a heck of alot in on motion


[26-Jun-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	one motion*


[26-Jun-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My estimation is that until the "we can set prices on COGC and POPI items", the "donate and payout" will have some bumps.


[26-Jun-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Agreed, until now I've basically just used the tax revenue to fund the essentials then I donate the rest. It'll be a much bigger cost going forward and people will need to approve the payout, so as you say, politically heated discussions to be had I'm sure!


[26-Jun-24 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People?


[26-Jun-24 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most of these ADMs around, are special interests.


[26-Jun-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I know the single-govs around, but there's alot of consolidation attempts at various places.


[26-Jun-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The in-game gov channels will get heated, when you have a minority motion base, and all you need to do is to convince 1 person, to forward your agenda, of whatever it may be.


[26-Jun-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	Looks like the contribution motion can be successfully rejected without affecting the other contributions/motions, so a "pass the hat around" but can be declined kind of fund raising is possible


[26-Jun-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	This includes payouts, contributions, et.c.


[26-Jun-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	but doesn't look like there is a way to check if each part of the motion was successfully accomplished without shifting through the contracts


[26-Jun-24 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's kind of interesting... I can see "Revenue from base establishment fees 0.00" in governance FIN.


[26-Jun-24 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yep, new feature


[26-Jun-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its more of a "oh hey, two people established bases here."


[26-Jun-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or a , hey lets control our popi costs by limiting open development with a tax to come here


[26-Jun-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or a keep my planet mine sorta thing


[26-Jun-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not the intent I'm sure, but it will be abused


[26-Jun-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	*will be, more like could be


[26-Jun-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The base creation fee is kind of useful on small planets with more tightly managed pop.  There are times when a new person puts down a base and suddenly there's 600 open PIO jobs that need to be filled on a planet with only 6000 PIO total.


[26-Jun-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That needs some changes to programs and such - and the base foundation is a way to help manage that sudden cost.  Which is a good thing.


[26-Jun-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	agree for sure...


[26-Jun-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As a note, I'll be doing another payout to Verdant on Sunday.  The tax collection change isn't an instant thing and MORE is still collecting some funds.

[26-Jun-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LYET**:	I'm loving seeing the motions in my notifications. Makes me feel more connected to what's going on


[26-Jun-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  Pulled up COGCU YI-715b - tossed them in a spreadsheet, and then created the motion and passed it.


[26-Jun-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll have to see about making that more automated ... wasn't too bad as is, but kind of clunky.


[26-Jun-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	not being able to clone previously passed motions is a drag, it would save alot of clicking


[26-Jun-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	I have a motion draft with 105 payouts of 69 each


[26-Jun-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Daw I was under the impression you were able to reuse motion drafts or something


[26-Jun-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't see any way of doing that at this time.


[26-Jun-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, so far today Verdant has received 459 NCC of production fee revenue.  This is in part because it takes time to complete currently queued jobs and requeue them with the new payment fee collectors.


[26-Jun-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	MORE has collected 148,812 NCC so far this week (and I will be moving that dividend back into Verdant's account when it pays out)


[26-Jun-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	you get the fee once the production queue is finished right?


[26-Jun-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	looking at my almost finshing 20 stack HCPs


[26-Jun-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Starts, but the it needs to be requeued.


[26-Jun-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	wait so the refund is taken straight from account?


[26-Jun-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When production starts, the production fee goes from your FINLA to the payment collector.


[26-Jun-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	but it gets unlocked and goes to government when queue is finished


[26-Jun-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When it was a single person corp being the payment collector, I'd get a dividend payout on Sunday (when I do my weekly update about taxes and such).


[26-Jun-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	sorry forgot question mark


[26-Jun-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When it moves from queue to production, that's when it goes to the listed collector.


[26-Jun-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But stuff that is in the queue from this morning (or in production from before) is going to MORE rather than Verdant.


[26-Jun-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And since some players (especially new ones) will have a queue that is a week out, small payment fees will trickle in for a while.


[26-Jun-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When something is put into the queue, it gets matched to the current payment collector.  So stuff that was queued yesterday goes to MORE.  Stuff queued today goes to Verdant.


[26-Jun-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... when it starts.


[26-Jun-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	ahhh I see, we talking about who originally is designated when the queue is selected, makes sense now that I'm thinking about it since its time stamped


[26-Jun-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LaenUnder**:	not for gameplay sense but coding wise sense


[26-Jun-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Anyways... takes about a week or two for queues to sort out and finances to be a consistent and clean source of revenue.  This isn't going to be bad / a problem since its not one corp to another transfering (e.g. me getting Sand fees when running here) but rather a "I got money? Ok, I'll do a contribution motion for that dividend and move the money (easily) back into this account.

**Isoroku**:	@shagie Question: When you did a payout, was that for purchases for Planetary Infrastructure materials? I'm asking because I was wondering how you would do purchases like that ... justpost on LM ,,, make a CONT ?


[27-Jun-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	popi and cogc contributions are still like they were - planetary residents can do at-will donations at the facility - I believe his payout was to reimburse those contributions.


[27-Jun-24 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	So you can do it without posting on the LM or making a CONT.I was trying to figure out a way to uhh encourage donations. I am in the middle of nowhere, so logistics is an issue


[27-Jun-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	under the old system, the governor would procure the goods and fulfill the needs of the planet generally - but then all the tax funds were being funneled through his corp.


[27-Jun-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	under the new system, the govt has its own accounting system, and though it can't generate conts, it can do payouts


[27-Jun-24 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Yes, I basically supplied all the goods, and the tax funds were always negative so meh


[27-Jun-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	with only 6 bases and <4k workforce, to be expected that the tax revenue will be low....


[27-Jun-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	That Verdant can have no warehouse or LM fees is certainly a good mark in the governors favor. This new transparency is great for learning.


[27-Jun-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Yep, totally get that. I knew what I was getting into so it is all good. I am sure having 70x the pop and being a major hub of commerce would go a long way to fixing the tax problem. One can dream tough

**Isoroku**:	*though


[27-Jun-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant can have warehouse and LM fees ... but, honestly, its inconsequential compared to production fees unless very high.  And I'd rather people be shipping into and out of Verdant - a free trade zone if you will - rather than trying to nickel and dime people out this way.


[27-Jun-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Snowfzy**:	Need them quick but buy them at 60% market price?


[27-Jun-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	do u have 960? if so name your price.


[27-Jun-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	I don't, but just saying that you have higher change of actually getting them if you paid decently


[27-Jun-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	it is decent. its production cost is lower than 80NCC per unit, even if u buy everything including water. im paying 2.5 times more than that


[27-Jun-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	But people could just fly them to the market and get 280 each -- so 80 more (and it generally costs 10 to ship each one if you pay someone to do it)


[27-Jun-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	additionally, there was the "sense of urgency"....that comes with a premium


[27-Jun-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you know I would hook you up if I could, I just don't produce GRN (nor store it on Verdant)


[27-Jun-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and my "ship" that was late over the weekend, is still MIA....


[27-Jun-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	1. well its not urgent just want them fast. i ll get 1k+ in 28 hrs. Just dont want to produce DW in Sand instead of RAT. But if i must ill produce them.


[27-Jun-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	2. 2 ship is inbount here. i just hoped to send them with first 1.

[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Planets _might_ be able to... but players can't.


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	If you go to that license page, under the free one it says "you can terminate contracts between your busines partners"


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	"Cancel contracts when you or your business partner change their mind or when one cannot fulfill the arrangement."


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	and have also seen that the new motions can do multiple things - shagie illustrated that this morning with the payout for popi contributions - all in one motion instead of 5 separate conts.


[27-Jun-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ppl get paid out for contributions? Geez this is a new thing.


[27-Jun-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I tried to do it before - but it was awkward.  LM contracts that I hoped people will fill before COGC came due.  Didn't work too well.  Its a "I really hope that delivery for DW comes in the next day"


[27-Jun-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	With motions, I went through, did a calc for what each person should get based on the CX price for if Verdant was to post a buy, rounded to the nearest amount, and paid it out.


[27-Jun-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm rethinking how I (we) should keep the books for Verdant so they're properly balanced.  While any (for lack of a better word) embezzlement from the planet is now clear with motions - its good to try to keep the books balanced.  Custodians of spreadsheets rather than beneficiaries of production fees.

**shagie**:	Built a new trick in google sheets since motions with multiple dispensations are possible.  Enter in a company name and it gives back the player name in another column.  Makes it easier to transcribe all of the COGC donations and make line items for them.

**shagie**:	In the last period production fees were 106,805.  (Gonna have to work on my spreadsheets) I've also got a motion in to move the dividend from MORE (it's Verdant's money) of 235,630 NCC into Verdant's accounts.  This will continue to confuse the 'current period / last period / previous period' type structure that FIN shows since that was money from the last period that will show up in the current period as general revenue.

**Geraldivar**:	I wish we had actual descriptions in the motions in addition to the component list of the enacted actions. That way posterity would be able to surmise the reasoning and intention for a motion. We know MOT-33-54444 was put forth to remedy and disentangle the previous style of government finances, and Shagie is quite forthright with the motions and the finances of the planet, but I suspect this is the exception to the rule.


[01-Jul-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	And increasingly long title for the motion don't cut it. I call this title, because it's shown in the POL overview, and I suspect the descriptions I envision would go far beyond what I've seen so far, not just on Verdant.

[07-Jul-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	luxury goods increase production rates, but also obviously cost money, so you have to decide if that's worth it


[07-Jul-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	if the profitability of what you're making is pretty high, then spending some money to crank out the commodity faster can be worth it


[07-Jul-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	for other stuff, if you're not making all that much of a profit on it anyway (especially if the main cost is workers anyway) then using luxury goods can really cut into your margins

Still awkward getting this sorted from MORE dividend to MORE dividend accounting periods to FINIS periods.  Next week we should be purely on the accounting periods.

[08-Jul-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaei**:	@HiddinVirus I believe they're linear by days with full decay at 180, so 4 parts you repair by 45


[08-Jul-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaei**:	condition deteriorates much more quickly as it gets lower


[08-Jul-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's not linear.


[08-Jul-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It goes on an inverse logistic curve. top line, that quickly swoops down to a bottom line, during a certain period....


[08-Jul-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your building condition is not a decay interval, it's a production efficiency number. Rather, go with your "Days from last repair". That'll tell you exactly where you're at. 45 day repairs are optimal for top performance, until you start building things with A-fabs though.

**Argonautis**:	Can someone help me with HQ relocation questions?


[14-Jul-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sure


[14-Jul-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	How is the benefit decided and How often can I relocate it?


[14-Jul-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	I currently have it on Montem but I am focused in Constructions and Farming. So I am trying to see if I can get a better bonus


[14-Jul-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not sure about limits/frequency - don't think there are any....will get you a link for the faction bonuses.

**Argonautis**:	Ah so its a Faction bonuses that counts on what you get not the actual planets that its located.


[14-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	for the hq, yes.


[14-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	planet is based n the CoGC


[14-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	"You can relocate your HQ to another one of your bases every 30 days. It will keep its current level."


[14-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	which is independent on each planet


[14-Jul-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but it's not your faction, its the controlling faction of the planet where you HQ is located.


[14-Jul-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	So Montem is in MOR, so thats NEC - whereas Verdant is a non-aligned planet, so our bonus is different


[14-Jul-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	NEO Charter Exploration: 4% bonus on metallurgy, 6% on construction No faction: 4% bonus each on chemistry, fuel refining and resource extraction


[14-Jul-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	ah ok I see now


[14-Jul-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Thanks a lot


[14-Jul-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you specialize everything to your faction's orientation, you'd be basically getting 1/2 of a COGC bonus everywhere, for free, even if you use all of your permits.


[14-Jul-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd think that the faction bonuses were intended to diversify regional production chains, through their inherent bonuses, but people decided, a long time ago, to diversify everywhere, even in-region. What we have now is a patch-work system where if you want to stay local, you'll be doing alot of different things, which may, or may not go against those inherent faction bonuses that everyone gets.


[14-Jul-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You still get the regional variation - especially with RAT.IC1 vs RAT.AI1 vs RAT.NC1 vs RAT.CI1


[14-Jul-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other thing that factions do is provide reason for currency which creates friction for goods moving from one area to another.  They do, but there's still friction ... and that friction also creates opportunity.


[14-Jul-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, you've got differentials in exchange rates, which results in preferential purchases when one region is cheaper than another. Surplus liquidity just affords extra leeway in purchases/shipping to/fro. Unfortunately, you can't plot any of it into a discrete function, since alot of it is just random activity, when seen as a greater whole. Sure 1 person may have a given idea of what they're doing, but the other 99 guys are probably either doing some thing similar, or completely different. Plus, there's the whole information assymetry thing, which is you don't know what everyone else is doing. Lots of chaos, lots of opportunity, and very little actionable information, unless you know what you're looking for.

**shagie**:	Yea! Only 20,420 dividend payment this week.


[14-Jul-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Last week's production fee revenue was 337,324 NCC ... and COGC payments had a general expenses of 193k.  This is slightly awkward with accounting since the COGC, motion passing, and the payouts can occur in different time frames.  Still, working with a production fee revenue of 337k is about what it used to be when MORE was collecting all of it.


[14-Jul-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This also means that there is a surplus between payment fees and COGC ... and the related challenge of trying to figure out how to do POPI payments.


[14-Jul-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They have a difficulty of being something that isn't as well tracked (I did grab a screen shot at the start of the term) ... and different things have different value in terms of amount of POPI happiness / NCC.


[14-Jul-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, DW has some of the higher happiness / NCC ratings ... but some calculations suggested that SUN would in the SST would also be similar.


[14-Jul-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I want to say that if you contribute to the SST or INF, Verdant will have the funds to compensate.  The current settings for the POPI (not having them running at 10) should keep it from getting into whack levels of PIO bliss that becomes difficult to maintain.


[14-Jul-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	To that end, if people do want to haul back and "sell" to the INF and SST, I think Verdant could fairly compensate for it.  I'll be looking into this more for next weekend's spread sheet dabbles.


[14-Jul-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@shagie POPI upkeeps run on factors of 30 day increments. 1) Pick what you want upkept. 2) Set any price for said upkeep. 3) Update as we go.


[14-Jul-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Even if said price point are not at a regularly updated ASK quote, I can almost guarantee that you'd get willing contributions, since they would yield, for themselves, guaranteed sales, on items are are haphazardly hard to sell, en masse on the CX.


[14-Jul-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The challenge of POPI upkeep accounting is that adding 1 item updates the "last update" but that shows the total for the past 30 days.  If I contributed 100 DW two weeks ago and 1 DW today, POPI will show 101 for today.  That makes it awkward.


[14-Jul-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Set a price point for a given period, and let the contributors PM you for quantities provided.


[14-Jul-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If they don't want to interact, well then too bad?


[14-Jul-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got screen shot from the POPI when the term started in discord.  In a week, I'll do diffs against the screen shot and current and work from that.

[14-Jul-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I understand that, but the current APEX interface allows very little for GAAP accounting. Either find a way to enact self-reporting, or don't. Anything in-between will just give out more suffering, in-game, than is needed.


[14-Jul-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	SST: [3k DW; 1.8k OFF, and 540 SUN, every 30 days]


[14-Jul-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	INF: [1.2k OFF; and 1.2k TUB, and 120 STR, every 30 days].


[14-Jul-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	PAR: [500 DW; 300 FOD; 100 PFE; 150 SOI; and 15 DEC, every 30 days].


[14-Jul-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Although no one really, ever contributes the last segments, of each, due to increasing costs of contribution, compared to benefit.


[14-Jul-24 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 45 DEC in my inv in case I need an emergency tech happiness infusion.  But I do not recommend (or want) people contributing DEC.  The Park is very low running.


[14-Jul-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, first row of upkeeps for any POPI structure iirc, are the most efficient.


[14-Jul-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Depends - in UNI, TUB > COF despite being further dow


[14-Jul-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	inactive universities offer benefits too, apparently.


[14-Jul-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	no, they're lost to the abyss


[15-Jul-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Milfei**:	:C


[15-Jul-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	chalk it up as a SY fee


[15-Jul-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Milfei**:	Also would ship upgrade be available only for PRO license, or is basic also supports this?


[15-Jul-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You need a PRO license to upgrade a ship.  The FREE license is what you start with.  PRO is what you get for some period of time.  After the PRO license lapses, it reverts to BASIC (if you paid for it, FREE if you had a 1 month code).  BASIC retains many of the contract advantages, but not all.


[15-Jul-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can upgrade your ships during a PRO license period and continue to use the upgraded ships with the BASIC license.  You can't get a BASIC license other than having PRO first.


[15-Jul-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	f2p challenge; efficient shipping routes


[15-Jul-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	kinda pointless since they can only self-ship, and the nav computer selects the actual routes...efficiency then just becomes a matter of throttle control and maximizing load.

[15-Jul-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	as a free license player, also look into CX arbitrage.  RAT.IC1 can be shipped to RAT.NC1 and resold ... and then find something to move the other way.


[16-Jul-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's easier to do that as a Basic licensee, since you can outsource the shipments to the public contract market.


[16-Jul-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's rather difficult as a Trial, since you'll have to use the x2 500 t/m3 ships you've got, for that.

**AgentDoug**:	how important is upgrading your HQ overall?


[16-Jul-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u want new bases, you need HQ upgrades.


[16-Jul-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	HQ upgrade gives permits > permits = bases


[16-Jul-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There is a slight bonus for unused permits.  As a Verdant HQ person and only a Verdant base, that bonus is seen in an improved rate for RIGs.  It also shows up if you do chem or fuel refining (which you wouldn't be doing on Verdant).


[16-Jul-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For the most part don't worry about that... though that bonus is strongest for new players (since the ration of 1 unused permit for 2 permits is 50% ... while I'm here with 2 unused permits out of 19... which is about a 10% bonus of the 4% bonus that we get)


[16-Jul-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(so I see 4.4% bonus rather than 6% bonus from a base of 4%)


[16-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People come up with very diverse business plans. If they're a non-faction HQ, Verdant could easily be a very profitable CHEM base for them.


[16-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Maybe... but you'd only really be running CHP, and it runs counter to the COGC ... and you'd be importing all the materials ... and YI-705c and QQ-001b are MUCH nicer for chem with resources there and aligned COGC.


[16-Jul-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	COGC bonuses can be thrown out the window, when you don't have better alternatives.


[16-Jul-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	COGC dispersion is, I'd say, very evenly spread across the CX regions --- even spread means that there's at least 1 MCG planet somewhere that hosts a COGC of that sort. Any more, within a confined area of a few jumps, and you'll start to have to make opportunity cost decisions, be it less investments in shipping capital, or less investments in more austere production conditions.


[16-Jul-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	BUT.... Things might be changing. The recent dev logs indicate planetary (orbital) gateway infrastructure, that will point, one-way, towards a system (or planet). That might change things up in terms of shipbuilding, if a massive communal effort can be garnered to ensure FTL capability for cheap STL ships..


[16-Jul-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Although, I'm not sure that it would change the COGC dispersion. Ensuring cheap jump capability betweeb a CX, some CX orbit planet, and some outer-ring planet could go both ways in terms of COGC preferences. I'm of the opinion that faction players should utilize their faction bonuses whenever possible, but I'm also of the opinion that people will like variety in their production ques, going into the future.

[16-Jul-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that, would be a game changer.


[16-Jul-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	Or have bonuses start magnitudes higher, and falloff based on population capacity fulfilled


[16-Jul-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	like how 100 scientists in the arctic are more efficient than 100 scientists in a city


[16-Jul-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd think that the devs would like to institute population based productivity modifiers (on like plot utilization on a planet), but they're not going to rock the boat, too fast, ya know?


[16-Jul-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	everybody bandwagoning the one planet with exportable water, but there's another with half capacity? why should global output be magnified if 100x people are sucking resources


[16-Jul-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	oh yeah, if they do put in modifiers it'll start slow, and grow to a worthwhile gap


[16-Jul-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	nothing that'd shake markets overnight


[16-Jul-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	but maybe encourage some to start saving and eyeballing more remote endeavors; if you're the only person on a planet wit max output, you should get much higher returns than everyone succing the rock next to the market


[16-Jul-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's a handful of water-worlds out there. Most are suitable for HYF bases, the rest are suitable towards FRM bases. You'll just have to learn the metrics yourself.


[16-Jul-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Everything else is bonus (anything without liquid water). It's not like you can't extract more water, if you want to... It's just that there's better opportunities for you to use a permit (think 60k NCC per day in profits, over 20k NCC daily).


[16-Jul-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	maximize output buying somebody elses water, why use the plot/workers for less returns


[16-Jul-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not the point. The point is, players maximize efficiency with 1 permit bases (500 area), and there's only so many players that can drop on a planet, before it goes dark (ghost plots).


[16-Jul-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	can you elaborate on ghost plots


[16-Jul-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's a certain limit where a bunch of ppl can do something rather efficiently on a given world, after that, they need to look elsewhere, with increased capital costs of shipping, and production.


[16-Jul-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	[PLI VH-331a] buffer command


[16-Jul-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jul-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jul-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	oh i didn't even know that was a metric on that page lol


[16-Jul-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	ignore half the rambling i've been doing then; there's already a limiter in place


[16-Jul-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	what's the +446 next to it?


[16-Jul-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lots of new bros choose that planet, for whatever reason.... Anyone who's in-game, who hasn't started on VH-331a, can't drop a plot down there, since the public plots are full, and the ghost plots (+xxx) are beyond full.


[16-Jul-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ghost plots are a mechanism, per the devs, that don't limit brand new players from dropping a base down, anywhere.


[16-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hence, the +446 of new bros, who dropped bases on VH-331a, after it was already full.


[16-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	I see, so i chose verdant as a starting planet because i have optimistic brain damage


[16-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That is one way of saying it.


[16-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But it's not the only one.


[16-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	and plots stay full once taken, right ? unless someone was to destroy their buildings and remove permit ?


[16-Jul-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Montem, Vallis, Katoa, Deimos, Harmonia?, Promitor? They all technically starter planets, that you also can't have a CORP HQ on, even if there were open plots (it's a complex definition).


[16-Jul-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some people do.


[16-Jul-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	ah so if i didn't start on montem i cant expand there


[16-Jul-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yep.


[16-Jul-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jul-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While some of it may be "cope" as they term it (I started on Verdant too) ... I believe that Promitor spoils players with too easy of a start... and then when they look at "1d 7h to ship from Boucher to Hortus?  Nope."


[16-Jul-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While on Verdant seeing 1d7h is "yea, we do that.  Big deal."

**shagie**:	WCB upgrade.


[16-Jul-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	i think the f2p wall i'll hit is not being able to have fast enough shipping lanes, but that's the fun of the challenge


[16-Jul-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	talking few months from now


[16-Jul-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Promitor and Verdant are equivalent in terms of resource density deposits, at least for water.


[16-Jul-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	ha...545k for the WCB part...i'm too poor for that now


[16-Jul-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For the WCB upgrade, talk to Schaitr of $LUME (and parliament member).


[16-Jul-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The key part of the upgrade is that the 500/500 ship that can only haul... 222 C - you can haul 1000 units of C in a WCB.


[16-Jul-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That upgrade (for hauling stuff like C) is not a 2x increase in size but rather a 4x ... and that's a _LOT_ of additional logistics capacity.


[16-Jul-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you get a cheap ship upgrade +, you get preferenced shipping for certain things, as compared to a MCB upgrade.


[16-Jul-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other thing to look at is increasing the rate of income.  Max out Verdant's agri capacity and expand to Sand for more FP capacity or Frost for INC (disclaimer ... I've got more than casual interests in each of those worlds) which will let you improve on how much you make on a planet.


[16-Jul-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	MCB upgrade is almost as much as a WCB upgrade for costs... the only difference between the two is MCB.NC1 vs WCB.NC1


[16-Jul-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Prism is closer for your INC


[16-Jul-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also note that a WCB on the market is _much_ more than $LUME does upgrade packages for.


[16-Jul-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	From UFO discord: "    Standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k) - these are the basic parts required to upgrade to a WCB-capable ship"


[16-Jul-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's an all parts upgrade... because its not just the WCB - its also additional SSC, BHP, and FTL emitters.


[16-Jul-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	UFO discord: https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP


[16-Jul-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	CX pricings for ship parts/inputs are either surplus, or excess. They've stopped being excess a long time ago, so you'll likely be paying in margins for stuff that you can't arrange to be produced for you, at near-zero margin prices.


[16-Jul-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	$LUME discounts: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1202257500213366804


[16-Jul-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Excess == we want to get rid of this ASAP, since it's just money sunk in stuff; surplus is == we're fine selling at margin.


[16-Jul-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	LUME does not provide the SSC or hull plates


[16-Jul-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and as I read down further I see that) ... still cheaper than CX retail rates.


[16-Jul-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	true


[16-Jul-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	A few of those UFO offers are beneficient towards newer players. The rest are competing for market dominance. I'm sure ppl can figure them out.


[16-Jul-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	that still requires PRO to actually do the upgrade, right ?


[16-Jul-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes.


[16-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	they're just offering contracts for the parts as a all-in-one package, yeah ?


[16-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yep


[16-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most of the parts. You still need to purchase 1 month of pro to build the upgrades, and then benefit from BASIC afterwards, if you want to.

**Jacob_Evans**:	Pro helps with that by unlocking reoccuring orders lol


[24-Jul-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Also, upgrading your HQ can get you more queue slots


[24-Jul-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	i upgraded mine to 2, no new slots


[24-Jul-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	the objective is to play the game without being forced into PRO by the different pay-to-play squeezes going on


[24-Jul-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	im not gonna pay pro just to be able to trade with other paid-clowns, to be able to use bigger ships, or to go afk harder on an afk game


[24-Jul-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	If I can't max out within my constraints without some unfair boogeyman, then there's no point in playing at all , as the game should be purchase, not subscription imo


[24-Jul-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	i get +1 queue slot at hq 5, which is the unpaid limit; so even your advice is tilted ; i dont get multiple slots. I get one when i reach my limit


[24-Jul-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	I mean, no need to insult people.


[24-Jul-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	You want to play in a way that you don't pay, that is fine. I was saying it is an option.


[24-Jul-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	if you took all those lines and the only takeaway is that you're insulted for paying, then it sounds like a case of sunk cost fallacy that keeps you playing this game

**MooseFTW**:	> paid-clowns

**HiddinVirus**:	AoE attack on the entire population


[24-Jul-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	I'm secure in my choice to pay. I have no regrets in that choice. I am enjoying the game and have been.


[24-Jul-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	I paid to support the game and the developers who make it.


[24-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Also, i never said you get more slots for going pro, you just get the ability to use recurring orders.


[24-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	scroll up,, literally the second sentence you wrote.


[24-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	dont try to gaslight me because you're coping too hard


[24-Jul-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	they're intertwined concepts


[24-Jul-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	If you feel comfortable knowing that you were foced to pay but it's ok because you actually wanted to , then the more power to you


[24-Jul-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HiddinVirus**:	'disguise it as whatever coping / " dev support " mechanism you'd like


[24-Jul-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	I wasn't forced into anything lol, No one threatened me.


[24-Jul-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jul-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jul-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	And then somehow after a month of playing the game, he still hasn't realized that he doesn't need to be so combative here. And he loves the term "gaslighting"


[24-Jul-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Yeah, apparently me disagreeing is gaslighting lol


[24-Jul-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jul-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jul-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	remember when I tried to give you some free MCG 30 days ago, and you went off on how I was trying to scam you?  And then how I was trying to gaslight you?  6/27, 10:34am


[24-Jul-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Janelle1116**:	Don't try to gaslight me and say you've only used the word once! LOL


[24-Jul-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elemir**:	when are you leaving, what price?


[02-Aug-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	before 6PM central time...10k for the 500t


[02-Aug-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	double the standard rate, so how long does it take you to travel from MOR to Verdant?


[02-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	hmm...wasn't trying to be double the standard rate...i just used the price that i've been paid to ship from Verdant to MOR on the local exchange


[02-Aug-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	and 27-28 hours normally


[02-Aug-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	standard rate is 10 per t/m3 (whichever value is higher generally) on a standard three-day cont, though some of us do pay higher.


[02-Aug-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	like the first listing on the Verdant exchange right now is 10k for 456t


[02-Aug-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	ok, good to know.  i just got into shipping in my spare time.  not trying to rip anyone off for sure


[02-Aug-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can charge whatever you like, and offer whatever you like, there are no hard and fast rules per se, that's just been the "standard rate" accepted by the community.


[02-Aug-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	are you still empty?


[02-Aug-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AgentDoug**:	cool...didn't know that, but i do now...so i'll modify my rate...5k for the full 500t/m3...leaving within 3 hours


[02-Aug-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I can fill it, I'll send cont


[02-Aug-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Scorpium**:	Those base repairs really do like to separate us from our hard earned cash!


[06-Aug-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	get yourself a nice construction base.  you inspired me to do the math: I have about 1.7 million to repair everything right now, but I have enough prefabs on hand to cover all but 500k.

[06-Aug-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Yeah, but how many bases do you need first for a repair base to make sense?


[06-Aug-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Well, you can always sell the overproduction, of  course...


[07-Aug-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	If you grow here and have anther planet set up for food processing then a construction base might be a good move soon, or a smelting base to provide the FE for your prefabs


[07-Aug-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Assume you don't use any of the production of a construction base yourself - you still have a base that makes good margin on a product that's always in demand - that makes sense no matter what.  If you can then use some of that production for maintenance, paying way less than you would on the market, that's even better.

**Roh**:	@Jacob_Evans sent.


[11-Aug-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It seems like we missed out on a COGC refund, sometime in the past two weeks. If people have kept receipts, send them over. I'll process the current COG period logs, and doll out the returns. Non-BASIC/PRO licensee cannot get rebates from the governmental entities, since they can't accept contracts. I'd advise those, who are still on a TRIAL license, to not contribute to it, if you are looking for a rebate.


[11-Aug-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If anyone has a copy of shagie's rebate spreadsheet, tucked somewhere, send that link over as well. Else, I will be using the standards on Pallada's motion board, to adjust the refunds. (ohh geez, that info gets cleared for the public, per term. I guess I need to repost those things also).


[11-Aug-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The rest of GOV's POPI material quota for DW.NC1, at current 95 NCC/u ASK rates, have been posted to this planet's LM. If you're interested in the price, and have DW in-stock here, feel free to pick them up.

[12-Aug-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Valencia_Minh Ima go for a walk. When I get back, I'm probably pulling the trigger for everything else. COGC rebates are back in, so is POPI rebates (but hold off on that for now, until you see the motions voted in).


[12-Aug-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Also, a small tax hike, for a duration of ~3 weeks at minimum. We need to balance some things out, since well, yeah, some numbers just don't add up. It shouldn't be too much though.

[12-Aug-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Aug-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	life happens


[12-Aug-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah. You can still vote for shagie, if you want. But I think we'll go along with a #de-facto governor, one who would like to take the lead, in the next term, even if they're not the actual GOV.


[12-Aug-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm pushing through short-term expenditures, via [GOV YI-715b]; to stabilize PIO intake, establish a public-based market for COG/POPI upkeeps (first come, first served, via posted rebates), and raising local fees to balance that out.


[12-Aug-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	COGC/POPI contributors are getting full rebates, for what's been posted, at least from what receipts/records are available to me. This week's stuff is getting dolled out in ~2 hours. If you don't see a POPI Rebate motion, of the kind involving INFRASTRUCTURE | COMMODITY | PPU, then you're running the risk of no realized rebate, for whatever you donate.


[12-Aug-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those employing TECs, are getting the short end of the stick, however I hope these measures, including the private upkeeps I'm importing, will quiet those concerns in 1-2 weeks. There's not much that gov can do, efficiently, when you have ~260k PIOs eating up all of the POPR stuff...


[12-Aug-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	With like ~3 weeks of downtime, until @--SCHAITR-- pointed out potential issues. :/

[13-Aug-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Aem it's ongoing issue, in the long-term. Basically it's due to education + unemployment. The PIOs get educated into SETs, and then those SETs leave the planet, since they can't find a job.


[13-Aug-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	I'm carbon farming on the side as well so the base storage really tends to fill up quickly, always put the "departing" goods to the warehouse, then just empty the warehouse into ships


[13-Aug-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	I wouldve left my 10 warehouses if it were like 200/per

[13-Aug-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Yeah 100 or even 200 ain't too bad, but 500 is way too much, at that point the STO is a better option :P


[13-Aug-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I don't like warehousing being more than 100. I don't even care if worker fees are high, I just really dislike warehousing being like that :p


[13-Aug-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Yea I know the feeling you mean, the constant weekly bills, like an unnecessary subsricption service


[13-Aug-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Snowwfzy yeah I get it, but gov needs some more revenues to balance things out in the long-term. Per current WAR rentals, it's basically equivalent to the current production fee reveenues, that were in-place before yesterday. We could change it, but that extra revenue requirement would go into the production fees instead, ~ doubling them from 12 --> 24 at least.


[13-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You're just see a re-labeling of the warehouse expenses, as more production fee expenses. Uhm, I think a short vote tally in here could be the best? So +1 if you don't mind how the revenues are charged to players. -1 if you're like to see revenues being largely purely taken by production fees.


[13-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	+1


[13-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm obviously biased. :P


[13-Aug-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What is it.... If you're renting 10 WARs rn, that's a 5k NCC weekly fee? If you're running the dingiest of production processes here, you're making ~245,000 NCC in weekly profits. Stingy players, being stingy :P.


[13-Aug-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The thing is - the only reason so many people are renting that many warehouses is because they were free. Knowing they're 500/u, if/when people notice I don't expect anywhere near as many people to be renting them.


[13-Aug-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Knocking production fees to 25 is not close to unreasonable as long as you're running it properly.


[13-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	And tiering the rates, tech rates should not be equal to pio rates


[13-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	This will all of course require some level of transparency, considering shagie wasn't running it out of pocket....


[13-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Mmm, K. I've heard your point. I'll run a motion to invert WAR fees down to 50 NCC/u/week, in lieu for more production fee hikes. Next week though :). ^ that too....


[13-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	25 PIO, 40 SET, 75 TEC for example.....and WH at 100/week - that's the universal standard for WH (my suggestion - I personally have 5 STO so don't use the WH)


[13-Aug-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	I disagree with his input


[13-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	and you want more fees?


[13-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We're dealing with the sudden shagie AWOL thing, before it becomes a big problem (in 2-3 months from now). Sudden changes, for sudden developments, a rocky road indeed.


[13-Aug-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	there is such a small population of settlers and engineers. Raising taxes will defer future habitants


[13-Aug-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	I immediately unrented all 10 warehouse units. And for what it is worth, I don't care at all about production fees being quite a bit higher.  And obviously they should be tiered higher for Techs -- I make a lot more money off of those


[13-Aug-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**JoeRider85**:	The only thing I look for when settling on a planet is whether they have Technicians or not (and I guess if the production fee is so outrageous that it dissuades me).  I will always choose a planet with 3000+ tech population vs 200 pop with 5 NCC/prod fee


[13-Aug-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That sounds like a dating preference.


[13-Aug-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	Oh this is Verdant -- I only have pioneers and settlers here


[13-Aug-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Overall population dynamics are determined by what all people are doing there. If barely anyone is employing TECs, you won't have much of anything there for them, no matter how much money is thrown at the problem.


[13-Aug-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	biggest tech industry here is orchards and there are only a handful of folks running those


[13-Aug-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(I also only have PIO and SET here)


[13-Aug-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Zugore I'm aware. The changes in effect/being proposed, will include TEC/ORC sustainment in the future, should ANY group voice themselves to GOV/PM/or here, that they'd like it.

[14-Aug-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It takes like a week for the new fees to take effect..... And they're be getting shrunk down in 6 days anyways, to 50 NCC, per unit, per week, if my suggestions on the bunch of motion drafts, which will get voted on in ~6 days, gets passed.


[14-Aug-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-24 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@AirbusFloA320 you can contribute to politics without even having a PM seat. For instance, what do you mean in "high online times"?


[16-Aug-24 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, just wanted to let everyone know that Shagie has not been active in game due to some personal issues. While he's been the gov here for a few terms and has done a great job, he will be an absentee gov if elected. I'm not canvassing votes for myself (I have enough on my plate), but this is something for you to consider when voting.


[17-Aug-24 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Copy that, wish Shagie the best


[17-Aug-24 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	The 9 of you currently voting for shagie -- please don't elect an absentee governor. We can always vote him back in when he comes back, but even then he's gonna have a lot on his plate getting his affairs back in order.


[17-Aug-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I think it's been enumerated several times, over this past week, that shagie went AWOL. People will be voting however they want, and whatever.


[17-Aug-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'll be setting to vote, the final draft motions for this term, in three days. Most of the LR changes that you guys seen last weekend will be getting mostly reverted, since I've rehashed some things into a better strategy. Should they be passed, then the next term will have a very good rubric of how to conduct their governmental business -- beyond it, then whoever gets voted in, will just have to figure out things for themselves.


[17-Aug-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Term 34's financial reports will be getting dropped here, and on UFO, later tomorrow. On Wednesday/Thursday, I'll post the TL;DR of the passed motions on UFO. Shagie was running the gov from his own notes/method. If anything, both of these postings should give Term 35 something to start on. If anything, they'll have access to the gov chat channel, along with all of the notes that I passed in there --- I don't think that many would actually read any of it though. It's whatevs.

[18-Aug-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Term 34's financial affairs have been concluded. The following are the overall notes I've taken on them. These figures are from financial activity when realized, and not when performed, in the GOV's FIN buffer (I'm not looking through that mangled list):


[18-Aug-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Term 34 - Week 1 - Financials

**Roh**:	Revenue Composition: [Production Fees: 341,742; Warehouse Fees: 0; LM Fees: 0; Base Fees: 0; General: 0]. Weekly Revenues; [341,742]; Expense Composition: [COG Upkeep: 0; POPI Upkeep: 0; POPR Program: 0; POPI Upgrades: 0; Infrastructure Upgrades: 0].

[18-Aug-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Revenue Composition: [Production Fees: 375,991; Warehouse Fees: 1,970; LM Fees: 6,070; Base Fees: 0; General: 300,002]. Weekly Revenues; [684,033]; Expense Composition: [COG Upkeep: 234,090; POPR Program: 0; POPI Upkeep: 14,060; POPI Upgrades: 0; Infrastructure Upgrades: 0]. Weekly Expenses: [248,150]; Liquidity Surplus: [435,883 + 1,597,475]; [Net Cumulative Debt: 0; Debt Repayment: 0; Net Balance: 0].


[18-Aug-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The rest of the financial notes will be posted, along with the above, on UFO. Our parliament will be voting on finalized LR rates targets, and long-term strategy tomorrow. The results of that will be dropped here, and on UFO, on Tuesday.


[18-Aug-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	--------------------------------


[18-Aug-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Who made the 300k ncc contribution in week 4, and what was it's intended purpose?


[18-Aug-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Me. Lets say it was a buffer for "mistakes". We ran Festivities II... it's an 80k expense. Since then, I've found out that the timing wasn't right, and the effect was too little.


[18-Aug-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But next term, or the one thereafter, there will likely be a need to push through Festivities III, for a handful of weeks, to import like 20-50k PIOs. Each of those weeks is like a 150k NCC expense, not including any POPI upkeeps.


[18-Aug-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Check out [   POPR YI-715b   ] --> 180day spread. It's eactly what was done here before. There's no way to prefent PIO loss due to education rates.


[18-Aug-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It looks like this planet can handle up to like a 18-20% PIO unemployment rate, without migration. The whole mass of those will be used to buffer out the PIO->SET seepage, and subsequent loss.

[20-Aug-24 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	It takes a week to change the popi levels, so now we will be stuck at 0 for at least one week on all popi infrastructure - why was this done? Ehy pass motions saying you'll pay for popi upkeep contributions if you're essentially turning off all the buildings?


[20-Aug-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Hence the "no" vote... But hey, democracy


[20-Aug-24 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's high unemployment levels across all used pops. Using more POPI upkeep mats + materials, will just increase more education rates (PIO -> SET) and (SET -> TEC), who will not be used, and will just migrate out. We're never going to get 50% TEC happiness, at any unemployment level, unless we doll out more POPI upkeeps than our revenues allow for.


[20-Aug-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Why? Cuz we have 250k+ PIOs; they eat up everything.


[20-Aug-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	A soft landing would have been better


[20-Aug-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The plan is to cull the unemployment a little bit; then surge POPI with festivities, to import a huge number of workers, which will act as a buffer for the education + migration sinks.


[20-Aug-24 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	This sort of operation was done back in mid-April. I of course, have no information on what sort of upkeep values were had, back then, but the inference per the POPR happiness rates, back then, basically corresponds to this sort of thing.


[20-Aug-24 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	IF more people want to run TECs (a 1 permit base affords 3 ORCs, max, using 30 TECs), well then we should look into it then. But this planet is majority PIOs, and due to the PIO size, there's an inherent PIO--> SET education rate. The reason for the SET migration-out, is due to the high unemployment, which is cutting into the base happiness values.


[20-Aug-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	we could sell bases to people that arent here with settler population


[20-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	I could loan out fermenting bases that make wine on site... thats around 1000 SET each base


[20-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh yeah, totally. But that's a you thing, and not a GOV thing. I'm just looking at the recent POPR rates, and trying to experimentally figure out the least expenditures possible, for maintaing some unemployment in all useful categories, for our COGC/planet.


[20-Aug-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If we got another 20k employed SETs, that would double education rates for SET --> TEC, and offer more baseline TEC, in buffer, for more ORC stuff.


[20-Aug-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	its a 200k/day profit base... ORC's could sell their grapes to people here on site, not have to transfer it to a CX...it would make the economy of the planet great


[20-Aug-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	there couldnt be an insane amount of fermenters but it would put us in the right direction


[20-Aug-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The usual angle is just to run HYFs for SETs/PIOs. I'll probably surver this whole planet, on the weekend, but opening up 322 simultaneous buffers just makes me cringe.


[20-Aug-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Then export that stuff to the nearest FI COGC, being Sand?


[20-Aug-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	nearest FI is Sand, yes....and I think most here are simply FRM not HYF.


[20-Aug-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, we'll find out. The useful thing with doing so many projections, is that I have accurate base usage percentages. It makes figuring out who's doing what, much easier.


[20-Aug-24 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But the surplus PIOs won't drop below 10k. As for the other peeps, they shouldn't be dropping below the employment figures. If either reaches those minimums, I'll pull the trigger for POPI + Program pulse. This is cost saving measure. If we don't do this, we're looking at hiking taxes 100%, for ineffective POPR gains, since there's no new incurring need of more workers. If there's people who are dropping their higher tier things, yes do let us know in here.


[20-Aug-24 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of course, will they? Probably not.


[20-Aug-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	yea i was going to suggest HYF but they are a little expensive for me to loan out haha


[20-Aug-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Where's the nearest Chem planet to here? MOR system is borked, as Vallis is a filled Chem COGC?


[20-Aug-24 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Kleptomedia I've recorded your POPI contribution. Your rebate will be had in Term 35. Since you dropped it before then, your rates will follow per Term 34's offers, of 95 NCC per unit of DW. :)


[23-Aug-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Even though Term 34's gov decided to turn of POPI upkeeps, as a cost-saving measure, they will be turned back on #soon. All POPI rebate notices will be kept in record, and will be dolled out on the next term. Of course, the COGC/POPI rates will be up for PM debate/vote, via Term 35's term, rather soon. Planetary program + upkeep levels will be hammered out within Term 35. Everyone's in the safe zone for the next few weeks -- Term 35 will need to hammer out expenditure plans. There's no LR rate hikes planned, so anyone seeing an increase in WAR fees, just consider it a one-time expense.


[23-Aug-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	x4, 500 t/m3 shipments posted on our LM. I'd like for each shipper to take one, as they are 15 day timers, but I can't stop people from gobbling up the rare shipping offers. :/

[23-Aug-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I didn't see anyone voicing their interest in tendering those contributions, so I have to backstop those upkeeps if no one decides to contribute it.


[23-Aug-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pharnacis**:	I'm not sure what's needed, since when I look at the COGC window everything looks fulfilled already?

**Roh**:	Other peeps are supplying the RAT/DW/PE. There was one trial licensee who dropped MCG for a bit.... And there's no way for us to pay them out, since they cannot accept any contracts.


[24-Aug-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	@Roh wait, all the contributions we do we can get paid for? If thats the case then I am intrested bacause I often have ships coming here and going back. I could bring some of the stuff needed.


[24-Aug-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Argonautis Yes. Term 34's prices:


[24-Aug-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	COGC Rates: [RAT/DW/PE/MCG] | [150/95/10/35] $/u


[24-Aug-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	POPI Rates: SST | [DW] [95] | [5000# per 30/d]


[24-Aug-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	POPI Rates: INF | [OFF] [100] [3000 per 30/d]


[24-Aug-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	POPI Rates: PAR | [DW] [95] | [5000# per 30/d]


[24-Aug-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We've shutoff the POPI for now, to cut running costs, but the POPI will get turned back on soonish.


[24-Aug-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So if the reserves are capped, you can't commit anything more, per those Building | Commodity | PPU Rebates.


[24-Aug-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	GOV can't shutoff COGC upkeeps, so that stuff is our fixed operational costs. Variable costs are POPI upkeeps, per those postings, coverable up to max reserve capacity, but nothing more.


[24-Aug-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	All realized contributions, under such terms, are guaranteed (I keep notes as well). But if you're hoping to donate some dank COF.NC1, in hope for a profitable rebate.... you won't get one (since it's not posted) :P


[24-Aug-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Term 34's motion postings got deleted this morning. The new ones will get posted Monday-ish, but consider the things I've dropped here, and in UFO #verdant-politics, to be effective, until then?

[24-Aug-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	$SLW buying up H2O.NC1 @ 20 PPU, too low for Verdant... Exports easily make up for the maginal difference by exporting to MOR, or elsewhere.


[24-Aug-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh, it looks like someone just picked up a MAI.NC1 ad here, at 210 PPU for 500 units... Nice... But shipping it to MOR can get you better ROI.


[24-Aug-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	$BEAR is alright with the GRA.NC1 offers, but they need to realize, that like, at most 7 people are running x3 ORC, 500 area bases on Verdant.


[24-Aug-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	going over to the LM ASKs (buying is BID, selling is ASK).... $MHC is fine with their FF.NC1 provisions.


[24-Aug-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Argonautis**:	Well I am trying to see what people are expecting to get paid per m³ or per t


[24-Aug-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	That pays almost 4ncc per t


[24-Aug-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Last week quite a few of those contracts got picked up. I am not in a hurry so it's not profitable for me to post them with 3000 per contract.


[24-Aug-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Those 3k contracts pay 15ncc/t. For this price you may as well post a buy order at Moria and just get them there.


[24-Aug-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lets see. I've dropped 2083 MCG | 500 t/m3 shipping conts. Differential between buy and rebates is 10,415 NCC, Contracted shipping is at 8k a pop. Net margin of 2,415 NCC for me, IF I ever contribute such MCG to the COGC.


[24-Aug-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	I am trying to pay a fair price for LM contracts and to be honest I don't remember why I posted it lower than 5/t as that's the usual price that I would pay.


[24-Aug-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Do you think that's low?


[24-Aug-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you want it picked up and done, within the next 1-3 days, it's low....


[24-Aug-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd hold out until you can reserve a full 500 t/m3 allotment, and then provide like "full rates" for service.


[24-Aug-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Contract shipping is usually done, with those 500 t/m3 reservations (compartmentalization), with the highest bidders winning service. Without it, and without your own ships, you're going to be waiting here, at Verdant.


[24-Aug-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I price my stuff, out like that, per 500 t/m3 reservations, since the contractors have to fly out here, which incurrs a 2.5 --> 4k NCC fuel + depreciation expense, at minimum.


[24-Aug-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hence, no partial loads, just full packages, at full rates, at reasonable 3-5 day deadlines.


[24-Aug-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you want to do less than that, feel free!


[24-Aug-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	standard shipping rate is 10/t....rush jobs pay more...partial loads are ok as top-offs, especially wit remote planets, you're just tagging along on someone else's provisioning run, but the standard rate is still 10/t-m3. (Some of us pay more, but then we who do so, don't often use the LM)


[24-Aug-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	i always pay really well for shipments


[24-Aug-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	I have a few building materils sitting at MOR and could bring them over at my next run


[30-Aug-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Which ones?


[30-Aug-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Isoroku, do you want the COGC rebates? You missed last weeks. I reached out, and nothing.... I'll just keep reissuing it until the term is over. :P


[30-Aug-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Argonautis the partially donated SDP/ACA/ART popi buildings have just absolutely expensive upkeep materials.... We have 10 PARs (max level), and those basically cover mostly TEC/ENG (but really only ENG, that we're almost never going to use on Verdant).


[30-Aug-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Since so few people are using TECs here, I wouldn't be willing to do contruction payouts for them.... For the PBH | LIB | UNI buildings, it's a big ~maybe.


[30-Aug-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	This planet had a good TEC population of like 1.5k almost a year ago, but I think players switched over to different processes. 30 TECs per a 1-permit ORC base; 70 TECs per a 3-permit ORC base here.


[30-Aug-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those education buildings would give passive bonuses to the education rates per POPR, and they'd only be useful if players considered Verdant as the de-facto ORC/agri base in MOR peripheral space, so I'll look into it. But current TECs are being propped up by ongoing TEC immigration programs, until our excess PIOs drop down to like 10k unemployment, then we'll be running the POPI boosts.


[30-Aug-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Any opinions on this?


[30-Aug-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I agree with Roh - the only reason to build or expand POPI buildings is if they give you a benefit - and lots of times people just blindly fill them when it is not needed.


[30-Aug-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The population of Verdant is TOO large - so continued dropping of Settlers is important to keep expenses under control.


[30-Aug-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	We have around 17k Pio and 4k Set excess population.


[30-Aug-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Its funny that my biggest problem in running 6 worlds is telling players to NOT stuff things into POPI buildings.


[30-Aug-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I think I'll add to that, just for a general explanation. Whenever people are building up "new" worlds, you want your initial WAR/LM/COG (COGC) instances to be placed down, as they're rather cheap. Afterwards you'll be focusing on meeting POPR needs, through T1 (first commodity tier on the buffer popups) with the SST | INF | PAR buildings, since they're the cheapest, and do afford very specific needs per the POPR pops that are required.


[30-Aug-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you want just PIOs? (you don't need anything. PIOs are self sufficient). SSTs are for SETs; INFs are for TECs, and PARs are for ENGs. Building up a large surplus population base may be expensive, however, unless players actually need those workforce tiers to fill their bases, you're just wasting money on them.


[30-Aug-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Once your planet starts to use more than just PIOs, that when things get complicated, since you need to buffer out your unemployment, versus your current workforce fulfilment + expected base drops. There's also a constant PIO --> SET -- TEC, and et.c. education drain + subsequent SET+ migration out, whenever it happens.


[30-Aug-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Verdant GOV is currently taking advantage of those inherent mechanics, to keep tax rates low, to keep a growing cash reserve building (for future use), and to keep everyone's bases happy (of course, if your whole corporation is dropping down with niche bases, you need to say something to the Governor, or in a COMG, general planetary chat).


[30-Aug-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We've bascially inherited the basics that I've mentioned, at max level... We don't need anything more since I'm keeping tabs on the POPR rates. HOWEVER... If the GOV/PM is offering rebates, should you be a BAISC, or PRO user, and donate.... You should accept the rebate contracts from the planet's government....


[30-Aug-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We have a significant, but even-keel surplus. Let not your donation be met with no recompense. Yes, we have a 2.8 mil NCC cash surplus. I'm not going to let #shagies_dream be withered down to nothing.


[30-Aug-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	All cash advances are for COGC/POPI contributions. Your government is not taking any salary.... Unless the gateway update drops next week --- but then there will be copious public/private discussions on who's getting the doll!


[30-Aug-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Isoroku <--- anyone know this person? They have COGC contributions that were cancelled last week (inactivity, or refusal?)

**Argonautis**:	@Roh to be honest out of the 3 planets that I have bases this is the only chat that Gov people are actually reporting and speaking and trying to organize things.


[01-Sep-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	So if I understant correctly the only things that we should contribute is CoGC, SST, INF and PAR.


[01-Sep-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	I am assuming prioritizing them in the order I mentioned before?


[01-Sep-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Thanks for the information as well. I got some DW, PE and MCG that I will be donating at the next cycle


[01-Sep-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Incidentally, there's a first come first serve, so if you intend to contribute, the mats you’re thinking of might have been already supplied.

**Roh**:	@Argonautis, yes, those things, for contribution order, in that exact preferrence, although the COGC is the only real thing that needs input every 10 days, as the other things are shut off for the moment, to preserve resources.


[01-Sep-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iHateAnime**:	@Roh what your target unemployment or happines to turn on infrastructure buildings?


[01-Sep-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@iHateAnime ~10k PIOs, unemployed. I could whittle down that number even more, but I'd like there to be enough PIOs, for say 10 newbros to basedrop on Verdant in a week, and be fully filled out by the next POPR.


[01-Sep-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The TECs are being handled by immigration programs (50k NCC weekly for 100 TECs imported) - since there's no real way to address that population tier, on a planet like Verdant, without paying booku bucks.


[01-Sep-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If we pop open a construction buffer for this planet [   BBC YI-715b   ], the workforce reservation rate is 10%, so just multiply any pop requiresments, from any building in there, and you will get the actual % unemployed.


[01-Sep-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So, 16,210 PIOs unemployed left?

[07-Sep-24 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	this is one of those games where you get out of it what you put into it...by design it's fairly passive, sure you can set it up and do nothing for a week and it will seemingly play itself...or you can engage with the community, set your base on autopilot, then take your ships and do trading/shipping...you can be a 15-minute/day guy or an 18-hour/day guy...choice is yours.

**Roh**:	---------------------------------


[16-Sep-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	^ Just repositng UFO discord GOV financials to here, since I guess not to many people pay attention to that place.


[16-Sep-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	My overall statement of Verdant's financial health, is that it's very stable and healthy. No new taxes are being considered., since we've gotten the situation under wraps... We're also not going for forward funding for gateway construction --- that will be a private effort. We should be able to accomodate any private developers who are interested in the significant capital investments for such projects (~600 mil for a functional 2 gateway transit).


[16-Sep-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However, those private developers will be unlikely to recoup financial costs of constructing such things in Verdant's orbit, nor should Verdant GOV increase taxes, or doll out funds for such things.


[16-Sep-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We might do a short-term grant program, for newbro players with BASIC/PRO licenses, but i'll be limited, and will be a possible issue for Term 36.


[16-Sep-24 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Term 35's business is done. I hope all of our vendors have appreciated the rebates dolled for contributions, and I hope everyone here is happy with their production metrics.

**lowstrife**:	and now the final planet I will be posting this on


[18-Sep-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would recommend that the government start running the 20% happiness program


[18-Sep-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the government is wasting over a million per month


[18-Sep-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and taxes should be able to be roughly halved


[18-Sep-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ehhhh maybe less than half


[18-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	maybe only a smaller reduction


[18-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	our popi's have been set to 0 for over a month, so not sure where you're getting the wasting a million/month from.....all we've reimbursed is cogc


[18-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	amortized usage of SST to grow pioneers


[18-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	when they are used


[18-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but you're right I think actually I over-estimated the usage of that


[18-Sep-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but for example, report #163 through #175 the infrastructure was being heavily used without the happpines program being used, heavily wasting money.


[18-Sep-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I bring this up because I am warning all the starter worlds not doing this


[18-Sep-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and because verdant needs another growth spurt soon


[18-Sep-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Do you want more market sales of your consumer goods @lowstrife?


[18-Sep-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's actually funny seeing you spam type, your particular gov "feedback" when no one has seen you contribute in here, for 2 months.


[18-Sep-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	does that make me wrong?


[18-Sep-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We're on a buffer system. Would you like x3 more taxes on here?


[18-Sep-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I said taxes would be reduced


[18-Sep-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And you're the person who will be consigning for-profit loans, to PMs elected herein, should we ever decide to upgrade our Education infrastructure?


[18-Sep-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	how is that relevant to what I'm proposing? why are you bringing that up


[18-Sep-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Because it is a possibility, and such things are expensive.


[18-Sep-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I said this saves money


[18-Sep-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what are you talking about


[18-Sep-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So you want us to be running 100% FEST III, all the time, when we're currently not doing so, but will be running full POPI, and FEST III, for a short duration, in the near future, to gain a long-term POPR buffer?


[18-Sep-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	during growth phases, yes


[18-Sep-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you run 20% and full the SST's for one week


[18-Sep-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Do you have 20 PROs, who can drop on here right now?


[18-Sep-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And not just CMs... Full bases with workforce allocations.


[18-Sep-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for $400,000, you can fully fund the SST for one week and run one 20% happiness program


[18-Sep-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	taht will yield 30,000 pioneer growth in one week


[18-Sep-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and now you don't need to fund popi for 2 months


[18-Sep-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	zero


[18-Sep-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Are you on something? You've been spamming every planet you're on in the past day, regarding these recommendations.....


[18-Sep-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because I'm seeing a lot of money being wasted, and I'm making it known on each planet


[18-Sep-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but that's the math


[18-Sep-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and that's what will happen


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you're talking on the wrong planet


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	nope this is verdant and verdant numbers I'm talking about


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	all we're funding is regular COGC, and non-active POPI requirements, for listed Commodities.


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We'll pulse that shit, when its time, though.


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes this is the pulse I'm talking about


[18-Sep-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the last one you did cost millions


[18-Sep-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So you wan't 30k more PIOs, in like 1-2 weeks... and we'll lose half that amount, in a month afterrwards.


[18-Sep-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the decay rate isn't any faster


[18-Sep-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you want to do as much growth as quickly as possible


[18-Sep-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and then stop for as long as possible


[18-Sep-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	baseline happiness with zero popi funding is 55%


[18-Sep-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there will be no pioneer migration

[18-Sep-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It'll be so, since no one will be uptaking that amount... we're down to 13k umemployed PIOS.... My target for said pulse is 10k unemployed PIOs.... The TECs are being handled through immigration programs, since our POPR tree is skewed left


[18-Sep-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	take a look at the calculator for yourself


[18-Sep-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I did, last term.


[18-Sep-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	how much will your pulse for 10k pioneers cost?


[18-Sep-24 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not more than running FEST III, continously. take a look at [  POPR IY-715b  ] in the 180 day timespan.


[18-Sep-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I never said fest 3 runs constantly


[18-Sep-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I said it runs once


[18-Sep-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It'll give us 3-4 months of non expenditure.


[18-Sep-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	how much does your plan to grow 10k pioneers cost your way


[18-Sep-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lets run an experiment, yes?


[18-Sep-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Verdant grows PIO unemployment, by 10k...


[18-Sep-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because remember, it's $400k for 30,000 pioneers


[18-Sep-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and another few thousand settlers


[18-Sep-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it would have to be 180k for 10,000 pioneers


[18-Sep-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and it's not, it's much more expensive


[18-Sep-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you don't use the fest3 program


[18-Sep-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And.... where's the workforce need for that many additional unemployed mouths?


[18-Sep-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	FEST III will get you an additional 10k PIOs on face value... But where's the need?


[18-Sep-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's more financially efficient to do it all at once, it makes no change to the decay rate


[18-Sep-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It sorta does; once you go past 18% unemployment, then you start losing PIOs to migration, and not only education.


[18-Sep-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	250,000 pioneers, +30,000 is about 12% growth


[18-Sep-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it won't put you over


[18-Sep-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Fine.


[18-Sep-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But I'm not going to recommend it, until more PIOs get turned over.... Why waste the margins that no one is using?


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah you don't need to do it right now


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you could wait until you were going to run it, which I agree


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you could wait another week or two


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I advocated your point on Phobos as well.... Good idea, I just had to grind you a little bit.


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	max out the SST for one week only, all 10, and the happiness % program for one week only


[18-Sep-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and then zero cost for however long 30k pop lasts


[18-Sep-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Mind you....


[18-Sep-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	FEST IIIs only make sense on dense worlds.


[18-Sep-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	on the smaller, dinky places.... they don't get enough turnover efficiency


[18-Sep-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	what on Verdant are ya'll talking bout


[18-Sep-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think F3 makes a lot of sense on a lot of worlds


[18-Sep-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I agree not all of them


[18-Sep-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and it needs clever usage


[18-Sep-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's a start...


[21-Sep-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	i need another farmstead


[21-Sep-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	on Verdant, I'm up to 1800 PIO & 500 SET


[21-Sep-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(but that's sorta the limit unless I retool)


[21-Sep-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	hmm


[21-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	been at it a little longer than you, no worries...you'll grow


[21-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	maybe


[21-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	He’ll grow, naturally. He’s on Verdant, it’s in the name ;)


[21-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	i got 88 RATs


[21-Sep-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	That’ll last you a while. Unless you want to sell them.


[21-Sep-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	selling is the plan


[21-Sep-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the nearest sales point for you is the cx at MOR, so hold out as long asyou can, then take as much of your produce as you can afford to give up, take it out there and sell it...then buy the stuff you need to support your workers and grow your base


[21-Sep-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	i already did one trip out already


[21-Sep-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Then I suggest you pick up one or more of the faction contracts. That early in the game they should offer shipment contracts where they want you to haul stuff to the CX. The contracts would be able to pay for your fuel cost there and back again, usually.


[21-Sep-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	yeah, been doing that, stuck on gathering BEA rn


[21-Sep-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Hm… you’re not on BASIC or PRO. I would have offered you a 0% loan of a couple 100k to get out of the early game slump.


[21-Sep-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or we could just buy your produce right here at Verdant


[21-Sep-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Ah, that works too. Can FREE sell on LM?


[21-Sep-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	nope


[21-Sep-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	LM is limited to basic/pro


[21-Sep-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	cx is only interaction option available for Unlicensed folks


[21-Sep-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I need materials for a second farmstead, so if ya got the stuff, i got DW and RATs


[21-Sep-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats what we were just discussing - we're unable to contract with you directly because of your license status, your only option as a free licensee is the cx unfortunately


[21-Sep-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	oof


[21-Sep-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	as I said earlier, still playable, but it just drags it out a bit...


[21-Sep-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	game is designed to be an idler, not a 24-7 interface (like I use it)


[21-Sep-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	lol


[21-Sep-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	i got 2 Rigs, so water isn't a problem. A great choice


[21-Sep-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Oyo!


[21-Sep-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Folks. Some twistings and turnings in your parliament have given occasion, for me to tender a public inquiry!


[21-Sep-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The question.... Who has some sort of FTL shipping coming, and going, via YI-715b <--> MOR?


[21-Sep-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We'd like to know. Some of our PMs have had a hard time engaging shipments from this planet. IF you're able to tender shipment contracts, via the LM, or private dispatch, do let everyone here know!?


[21-Sep-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Via 500t/m3, 1k t/m3, 2k t/m3, or some variation.... :3


[21-Sep-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I just landed on Verdant with a 500t ship. I'm going back to Moria, and have about 300t open


[21-Sep-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Logic99 your rates? If none on Verdant GOV reach out to you, I'd bet that someone else in the public will? :3


[21-Sep-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	2400 for 300t


[21-Sep-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I'll be here for about 30 minutes before heading back


[21-Sep-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Sold.


[21-Sep-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Send me a CONT or post it on the LM


[21-Sep-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	does that cont work?!?


[21-Sep-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm old. I forget things. :/


[21-Sep-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	That's fine. More than what I asked.


[21-Sep-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I got a ship still on planet


[21-Sep-24 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	low on fuel atm thou


[21-Sep-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Low on fuel? Awww.


[21-Sep-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I wouldn't reccomend like 1-2 day shipments on that...


[21-Sep-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I got 819 STL and 57 FTL on board


[21-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	if ya would have said something earlier, I could have help ya


[21-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I already got a ship heading to MOR


[21-Sep-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	if the government is willing to pay for gas, ya'll can use my second ship. Its got 500t


[21-Sep-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	You would need a PRO/BASIC license to accept a contract


[21-Sep-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	ugh


[21-Sep-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yup, huge oof


[21-Sep-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	thats so annoying


[21-Sep-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	PRO/BASICs get all the love....


[21-Sep-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Trial users are just boinked.


[21-Sep-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Blame molp [   COMU molp   ] and not me!


[21-Sep-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I only deal, with what they doll out, via game mechanics :P


[21-Sep-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	im not gonna buy a license, this ain't worth it


[21-Sep-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	LOL


[21-Sep-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I gave some DW to the all the places in the city that needed it

**Zugore**:	you'll get there Jay - you have to realize he's been playing over a year and has bases on ten planets


[22-Sep-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	5 days for just 20 beans T-T


[22-Sep-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	the next batch is 7 days


[22-Sep-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Just in case you don’t know this yet, get the luxuries for the PIOs. They cut down on the production time (as do all efficiency gains, like through COGC and experts).


[22-Sep-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Coffee is comparatively expensive, if you have a FP you may get CAF and slot in a couple batches to produce COF from DW and CAF instead.


[22-Sep-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	ig i'll buy some coffee beans when my ship gets to the store


[22-Sep-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	Rule of thumb for efficiency gains: if you’re making money, the luxuries need to cost less per day to acquire than you gain by having 20% higher production.


[22-Sep-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	And if you’re losing money, no amount of efficiency gains will help, it will only increase the rate of loss.


[22-Sep-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	5d for 20 bea? 1 farm will produce 8 bea/day (assuming 100% efficiency)


[22-Sep-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	i needed a bulk order


[22-Sep-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I recall when I started out, I used part of my initial capital to buy 30-days of provisions so I didn't have to worry about the inefficiency factor


[22-Sep-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	forgot as a free licensee you don't have access to recurring orders (makes life a bit easier) especially early on when things seemingly take forever


[22-Sep-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	What I did was buy water to feed the FRMs, then set the RIGs and FRMs productions to take at least 24h so I would need to check and out in new work orders once a day.


[22-Sep-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I got 2 rigs


[22-Sep-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	I want 2 farms but I don't got the materials


[22-Sep-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Geraldivar**:	You’ll get there, don’t worry. You’re in luck, in a way, that RAT are currently comparatively expensive, at least to when I startet out. This translates to a bigger profit margin, assuming you’re a victualler.


[22-Sep-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JayTheMerc**:	yeah


[22-Sep-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Skahletto**:	looking for a corp HQ here to join


[22-Sep-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	Or maybe start up a corp with some people with similar interest


[22-Sep-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	DOLO is headquartered here, you're welcome to DM me (or any of us); and should you choose to apply the team will consider/vote on your membership.


[22-Sep-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	DOLO is actively recruiting new members - we can be of great assistance to new pro licensees starting out here on Verdant. Older players are welcome to apply as well, though a bit more scrutiny may be applied.


[22-Sep-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Inverse scrutiny metrics, lol.


[22-Sep-24 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We on Verdant, employ a non-Euclidian building setup. Instead of expanding out laterally, on this planetary surface, you instead scrawl down some rabbit hole, apply permits, and erect your buildings, where not too many people will actually know what you're doing. :P

[26-Sep-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ContortedDrop36**:	I bought pro a few days ago and didn't realize what I was missing out on


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What you miss out on, without Pro:


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1) No LM ads for you.


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	2) No more than 2 ships travelling, at any time.


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	3) No recurring production ques.


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	4) No FX orders.


[26-Sep-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	5) No private contracts.


[26-Sep-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ContortedDrop36**:	The shipping contracts are great, I've already done two and I'm now waiting for my ships to return


[26-Sep-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	recurring production queues alone made it necessary for me


[26-Sep-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, the whole methodology is like completely different, beween BASIC/TRIALs and PROs


[26-Sep-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You have quite a lot of overlap, if you do production in volume... But logging in, and queing up like 300 things, on a daily basis, is just something that warrants PRO.


[26-Sep-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	early game it wasn't so bad once I had a little surplus going. I'd put in max orders of stuff and wait. but even that was tedious


[26-Sep-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	and now? not a chance. I'd quit first


[26-Sep-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's part of the player attrition stuff.


[26-Sep-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	not to mention I have 8 ships constantly moving to keep it going


[26-Sep-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Too much to manage on a weekly thing? Just delete your stuff, and move on in life.


[26-Sep-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	absolutely. I feel like there's too much micromanagement even with PRO


[26-Sep-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ContortedDrop36**:	The self sufficient part of recurring orders makes the gamer more enjoyable


[26-Sep-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ContortedDrop36**:	*game


[26-Sep-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I've forced habits, based on ratios/schedules for my operations, on the weekends. A few things get handled here and there, but usually its just the same stuff, at regular days, every week.


[26-Sep-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	You're just trying to get elected Governor again...


[26-Sep-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	No, you're just witnessing some of the antics, that happen on Promitor, on the regular....


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And I honestly don't care. The mathematically based policies need be upkept... You can do it via private means, but gl;hf on the logistical upkeeps.


[26-Sep-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I take 0 income from this, apart from the materials I contribute to the upkeeps. Idk how it's on all of the other planet's I'm on. :/


[26-Sep-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	@Roh, as my kids would say, 'You're a hoot'


[26-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What's the consequent... ah yes...


[26-Sep-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I might be a "hoot", but am in Cahoots/Kahoots, with some special intersest? (from the french - cahute - referring to a cabin, or private space).


[26-Sep-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Maybe? All I do is make RAT/DW/OVE and COF, supplying them to the CX. I don't care for much else.


[26-Sep-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd'd probably make a Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus joke right here. (since i've been rolling this place for 2 terms)..


[26-Sep-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	If you're planning base expansions on YI-715b... Do them with such timeline in consideration. GOV shall be importing lots of PIOs, to be molested in the long term.


[26-Sep-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, I know y'all don't care about the unemployed PIOs. No one ever does (kinda like RL)?


[26-Sep-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	your best bet would be to 1) buy FF at MOR, then 2) post a shipping ad at LM MOR to get it out to you.


[01-Oct-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I see your ad on xg-430b LM at 5ncc/u - ff costs 19/u, and then there's the cost of fuel to get it you getting it to you, and then there's the profit margin to consider. You screwed up, so expect to pay a premium for the convenience and service.


[01-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadmiral**:	The 5ncc was a mis-type. Should be 20. Not asking for anyone to ship, just people with local bases.


[01-Oct-24 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	problem is going to be, there's only 22 bases on the planet, and some of those are inactive - I'll swing out there tomorrow if you still need it

[09-Oct-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Back in the 50's, and long before, American students were usually given 1-2 years of Latin, sometime in their high school years (gynmasium being the European equivalent). Before then, you had it instilled in you in the grammar schools (we call grades K-8 grammar school now, but when things were not so developed and centralized, you went to a rural-ish schoolhouse, where all the kids who lived around you got schooled in the same room, with only 1 teacher). My have times changed.


[09-Oct-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lets see, as I still have a pre-requisite curricula for University of North Carolina, dating back to 1819... For the grammer schoolers... Latin Grammar, Corderius, Aesop's Fables, Sacra Historia (shortened version of the usual bilical stories, in Latin), Ceasar --- Greek Grammar, Ovid, St. John's Gospel and Act, in Koine Greek, Virgil, Lucian, and some other things.


[09-Oct-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lmao... English grammar wasn't required study, until you got into the freshman year of University... All of the above you would have seen as preperatory stuff, which all the schoolhouses did, of course as dependant on the erudition and skill of the school master. :/

[09-Oct-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

In Cicero's absence, a rather damning speech of his is read to Consul Antony in the Senate.

**Roh**:	I can include an emergency rebate for SUN, via SST, since it's basically the same upkeep cost, but TUBs are your call. Maybe 1/2 market rate?


[14-Oct-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Its up to you to negotiate? :D


[14-Oct-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	<-- is basically an open book.


[14-Oct-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I was just looking to see what you needed and I could fill. I'm willing to take 1/2 the market rate for TUBs. I appreciate having a base on Verdant


[14-Oct-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Just wanted to let you know what I was bringing so efforts don't get duplicated.


[14-Oct-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1/2 rates on TUBs is doable.. I think MOR's rate for TUBs are like from 2-5 NCC per pop, which is what much more, via magnitude, off of the OFF @ INF, or just anything off @SST. I'll figure this in, as a discretionary expense, and re-factor overall POPI expenses, once i get POPR figures, in ~2.5+ days.


[14-Oct-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We've got TECs handled through POPR programs.. This will just be an added buffer for them, if anything. :)


[14-Oct-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	The Ship won't leave for another 2 hours, so if there is something you'd rather have, let me know.


[14-Oct-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ye, OFFs @ SST & INF.... @ 120 NCC per unit.


[14-Oct-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that's the unofficial rebate... Their prices skyrocketed early term, and I don't want to run more ADM price motions, just to offer a price tag... Full rebate, at that price, for that commodity, guaranteed.


[14-Oct-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you don't manage to submit the full amounts, just dm me, and I'll send private conts for them.


[14-Oct-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	So how many OFF total are needed


[14-Oct-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	2900 + 720

***user6a1fa4b0bb** left.*


[14-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	~72k profit for you.


[14-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Ok, then that's what I will bring. As you have probably figured out, I have 0 experience with government, but always willing to learn


[14-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah, purchase that amount at current asks...


[14-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	at MOR...


[14-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ship to Verdant within 1-3 days.


[14-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	So 3620 OFF will be loaded in 2 hours, ship will arrive in about 24 hours


[14-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I'm headed there anyway


[14-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	When you arrive, open up [   POPID p-YI-715b t-SST   ] OR [   POPID p-YI-715b t-INF  ] and deposit goodies, and you shall get paid out.


[14-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The current political term ends in ~4 days... I'd advise you to get here in less then 3 days, so I can roll the motions.


[14-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Glad to do it.


[14-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And no, this is no #political-favors....


[14-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I know the metrics, and I'm willing to doll out extra public funds, to guarantee supplies in the long term.


[14-Oct-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	No problem, I use those slaves too (c:=


[14-Oct-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, we're importing tens of thousands of PIO slaves right now.


[14-Oct-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I'll get my whip.


[14-Oct-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ORC production is basically backstopped by GOV measure... Not that we want to do so, it's just that the popr metrics are heavy with PIOs, and hence TEC growth is minimal without it.


[14-Oct-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's also including player demand.


[14-Oct-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not that many ORCs on Verdant, as is.


[14-Oct-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Will we do ENG/SCI stuff? F***-no.


[14-Oct-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	AGRI COGCs will never need anything more than TECs. Remember, we are a non-faction planet... We can squash you, if you do try that bs... this place is reserved for MOR/BEN AGRI growth.


[14-Oct-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We have fertility here... It's necessary for universe-wide production metrics.

**Roh**:	Random bs we're "testing" out.


[18-Oct-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	grant for a randomly selected newbie


[18-Oct-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I wish I could gamble


[18-Oct-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We're basically going to have some chunk of surplus GOV revenue. I have estimates drawn out, but they're general. The surpluses are coming from experimental results regarding POPR management, which are going to be basically cutting out a huge swatch of projected expenses.  I'll need 2 weekends to formulate a custom spreadsheet. Until that is done, w're just playing around with some ideas to keep this potentially interesting.


[18-Oct-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though I like the gambling notion (not from a govt perspective)....could start a lottery (unless of course there's a game rule against such things)....1000/ticket, 100k prize, weekly drawings.


[18-Oct-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	as a personal business venture


[18-Oct-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, we can also try out 0% interest loans... It's a little troublesome, but it's not like a general "loan" term can't be arranged with just 2 GOV motions.


[18-Oct-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there are plenty of banks and grantors in the game, don't think the govt (aka taxpayers) need to jump into that risk pool


[18-Oct-24 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, from a govermental point of view, don't call them loans – call them either grants or subsidies, that will have more appeal :D


[18-Oct-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	There also could be a cool game mechanic when you can set lower taxes for newer bases


[18-Oct-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Like "come to Verdant now and claim your tax-free 2 month of production!"


[18-Oct-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	When I finish my custom spreadsheet, this will be doable.


[18-Oct-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Although people will need to raise their hands, for it.


[18-Oct-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there are some players who choose to support newer player in various forms, there are others still that do not support such notions - let the grantors give grants, and all enjoy lower taxes.


[18-Oct-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Also true


[18-Oct-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah. Others however are rather shy, and don't know how to go about making friends. But if it's something that will make Verdant a fun and interesting place to be, I'm totally up for trying out a pilot program.

[19-Oct-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I keep seeing people suggest that folks complete the tutorials then choose a profession....perhaps they changed the order of things because when I started, it was pick your faction, then your profession, then based on that it gave you a list of suggested worlds to start on....tutorials didn't come into play until I was actually in APEX.

**bobnobrain**:	Probably


[24-Oct-24 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	So I'm very curious to see who's gonna accept the deal :)


[24-Oct-24 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's really not that rare - most newbies (even though they're advised against it) try to be self-sufficient for some length of time - my erroneous time was my first month....before I streamlined, but was still not CoGC aligned - in fact, at Verdant, I'm still not fully aligned


[24-Oct-24 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I understand if someone runs FPs or RIGs here because they are adjacent to CoGC. But metallurgy... Man that's interesting :)


[24-Oct-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I remember an old concept we had to run PT here - ship in the STL (for free cause no-one imports here) and process with the locally extracted O. Saves a ton out export from Verdant.


[24-Oct-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Never ran with it, because of course, Agriculture was too important. But they might be running that


[24-Oct-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Ship in FE, process to STL>PT etc


[24-Oct-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Oh, yeah, I see it now


[24-Oct-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Oxygen is probably the key


[24-Oct-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Might need to explain this was in the shipping crunch - months before FTL ships and everyone had 2 500t ships and like 8 bases.


[24-Oct-24 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MoLab**:	Hi there, anyone interested to join my corp to found the headquarters at Verdant together? Initial payment of 100.000 NCC for the shares...


[28-Oct-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Or... you can join LMAO for an HQ that will be built here in ~2w :)


[28-Oct-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Or DOLO who already has one....provided the members accept your application.


[28-Oct-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	or you can go stag like i have out of principle for the last 1k days


[28-Oct-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Btw, LMAO does not put any obligations on you, you don't need anything but 1000 NCC to join, and you get access to corporate trades, interactions, socialising and memes! We're just chilling :)


[28-Oct-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The corp mechanics as is... only get you like the 10% production bonus on a single planet, if you have a CORP HQ.... Everything else is up to everyone in each corp. Some coordinate in-game. Others coordinate on other platforms. Most people are chilling though.


[28-Oct-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm pretty sure those corp dividends are fully broken. I haven't seen payouts when I did a little experiment, for a few weeks, some time ago.


[29-Oct-24 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I decided for 100k NCC to join because I wanted to have people in the corp that are experienced with the game. Also I thought that one day there might be some use of the money developed...


[29-Oct-24 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well, it's not a bad choice... You can just do more with dm'ing anyone interested, for like a week. :)


[29-Oct-24 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can get more done, when everyone's on the same page, you like each other, and y'all know what's going to happen.

[03-Nov-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	best to start with the tutorials


[03-Nov-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guglhupf**:	just startet the first production line, do i have to wait 5 hours to continue the tutorial


[03-Nov-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I seem to recall doing them out of order (it was six months ago though so things may have changed a bit)....if there's a task thats dependent on the prod completing, then yes you'd have to wait to continue that section, but there are multiple parts to the tutorials


[03-Nov-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guglhupf**:	ah, seems like a good idea


[03-Nov-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	reason for doing them is it covers the basics so when you get stumped your ?'s are a little more pointed, easier to answer specific ?'s than "what do I do?"


[03-Nov-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it is by design a slow game....especially at the start....but lots to read, and explore


[03-Nov-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	click everything, look around...things start to piece themselves together


[03-Nov-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guglhupf**:	yeah, it looks very complex, but i dont know if ive got time for another job xD


[03-Nov-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoLab**:	We can do this together...


[12-Nov-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	On behalf of LMAO I'm proud to announce that our glorious HQ has been built! If everyone wants to join, reach us on Discord: discord.gg/B9MbAtJWRr


[12-Nov-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ewww... #competition.....


[12-Nov-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But FR. people have like 1 year or so (general estimate), before Verdant get locked out due to plot limirs.


[12-Nov-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	then I can sell my plot to the highest bidder


[12-Nov-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's in a limited range of player acitvity... You definitely could, but timing is everything.


[12-Nov-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yup...or it could be a lease-option....though we both know how I don't like those


[12-Nov-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	besides, my corp hq is built here, so sorta moot to consider giving up Verdant


[12-Nov-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, leasing is pretty bad, since you've looking at fixed costs (employment, consumables, permits, etc....); I prefer to do supply side arrangements --- hey you can get this much inputs, weekly, at x price, fixed in the long-term..... But that's a player decision ultimately...


[12-Nov-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The former is usually skewed against the lender, or renter, due to information asymmetry...


[12-Nov-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm gone for the day... if anyone is interested in this player/player negotiation topics, I'm pretty sure anyone on Verdant GOV, or the peanut gallery, can give you their two cents?


[12-Nov-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	my maths per ADI published spreadsheets, is already picking at that information assymetry


[12-Nov-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	(no, it's not a political thing ... I just get the least hate on there)... Loan metrics are now properly known, you anyone interested can access that spreadsheet, play with it, and negotiate with suitors, without any subscription costs.


[12-Nov-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	lol


[14-Nov-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your shares don't mean anything - it's just a sunk cost, since when someone leaves, they get no refunds, and no one gets dividends off Corporate Equity. You used to be able to get dividends off Corp Revenues, but that mechanic was depreciated since the politics update...


[14-Nov-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Here's a suggestion... Make your Corp Fee 0 NCC, and talk to people. If you peeps can agree to a general style of gameplay, and purpose, HEY! you just got a new friend, that can work with you. :)


[14-Nov-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	If only you could do that after the corp is formed :)


[14-Nov-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And @MoLab has probably spent some money on corp HQ already, so...


[14-Nov-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bobnobrain**:	(and warehouse)


[14-Nov-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yep. Basic (very basic) projections are 100% stable GOV revenues, to prop up COGC rebates. POPI rebates getting closed once we get full reserves on the DW/OFF stuff... We probably will never need to run any POPI upkeeps anymore, so we're at the lowest rates that can be had.


[14-Nov-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	weekly GOV income should be like ~60k NCC --- literally a running error.


[14-Nov-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I can't make it more accurate without getting more data.. Working on that through several means right now.


[14-Nov-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Y'all should know that it's a VERY busy time in the USA right now.


[14-Nov-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	but additional cuts for GOV revenues, in terms of accuracy, should eventually be had, maybe in 4 months, or sooner, with focus on PIO benefits, and higher tiers getting a larger tax load, all within minimum funding requirements....


[14-Nov-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohhh, and wait... where's that MOLA person...


[14-Nov-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We'll run some gov advertising, via ADM motions, for ya, for FREE!!! (basically a billboard advertisement).


[14-Nov-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	45 character limit... Send your stuff to me.. I'll double check if you're valid on Verdant. 0 NCC cost for them, for EVER!


[14-Nov-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	<-- emergent gameplay right here, and also on YI-715b


[14-Nov-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The idea:.... Ohh hey, I'm new... what's this ADM command (checks out the Verdant ADM billboard... more information! wonderful.. ohh corps are recruiting.. I have BASIC/PRO, so I will then message them).


[14-Nov-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's also 2 other items, that I'm putting to a public discussion, before any GOV vote....


[14-Nov-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1) Lotteries. Early game metrics, (<90 days of company registration) has a compounding effect on long-term player progression. BASIC/PROs only though. Free play has its limits. --- A pool of contributors offers some small sum of dosh... that dosh then gets distributed to a lottery winner, for newbros dropping on Verdant, who meet the criteria.. It could be 1mil NCC, 500k NCC, or just 10k NCC -- entirely dependent on donations, and will not be funded by Verdant GOV, but will be issued by it.....


[14-Nov-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	2) Ship | HQ upgrades: same early game metrics and compounding effects, targeted to BASIC/PRO players... Of course, any established BASIC/PRO player, should have some sort of interest in speeding up valid new bro progression into the mid game... Same sort of donation pool... Same sort of random lottery system for winners who get automatically validated/verified by dropping on this planet, and being under 90 days since company creation....


[14-Nov-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Both #1 and #2 information will be publicly available, so all you private interests, you've got a good chance to make decent pitches to any winners when they get dropped in the ADM motions.... if these ideas are good? idk....

**MoLab**:	Nobody knows if developers change the finances of corps. I think I will keep it at 100k NCC.


[14-Nov-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	lol, okay....


[14-Nov-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hey @molp... I know that you guys get around ~60k EUR yearly through statistically distributed player subscriptions... and I guess that doesn't pay for all of your company's billing, and I'm trying to incentivize players into actually paying for premium features, to play this game with perks.. It supports you. It supports any other BASIC/PRO players out there with BETTER mechanics...


[14-Nov-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Make the BASIC/PRO life easier, by putting in the mechanics that people are ASKING for on the forums, and on the discords. Shit, I'll even ask a German friend, to translate a good paragraph or two, for you to read in full comprehension. Petty mechanics like "static" corp fees make no sense, among MANY other things.


[14-Nov-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	BASIC/PRO subscription billing = a vote, and enough rational, common sense, and simulogics + player needs stuff, should be focused on....


[14-Nov-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And I'm not buying that whole dev log thing with the gateways either... I'm pretty sure you're just dragging out the development schedule, beyond actual development production, to justify a limited release schedule, to try and skim off as much long-term interest as possible.... Not good!


[14-Nov-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Quality of Life - QoL updates matter more to a willing, and paying player-base, than more "content".


[14-Nov-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@MoLab there... You've got something to drop on #Feedback or #feature-requests on the forums... If I don't see your stuff there in a week or two, AND if similar posts are on the forums, I'll ping molp on UFO discord myself.... That precedent has been reset last week btw...


[14-Nov-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Idc. I pay for subs on this game... and if you also do, and have pertinent stuff that needs to get "better"... I'll make a lot of noise.


[14-Nov-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	K, it'll drop in 5 hours, 10 minutes from this posting. I'll stay awake -- I've got lots of reading to do, and yeah I'll try to double check it before i donk out.


[15-Nov-24 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Dec-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some do poorly, because they invest in low-margin industries... Others do alot better, since they invest in higher margin industries. It all really doesn't matter, if you can make ends meet, week-by-week. I've stopped caring for the #profit/capital figures a long time ago. If you have had a better success in this game, as compared to me or anyone else, well then good for you... But it's all driven by player goals, so do, and aim for, what you want.

[11-Dec-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

"I will try to be active as much as I can via the VOG COMG (gov chat), ask questions, and ask for input on Verdant, or other planets that I'm interested in)... We've got a few tools hosted in our GOV COMG atm, some more will get published in time.


[11-Dec-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If your corp wants to fully vote you in... You'll have to provide questions/feedback on a twice-weekly basis when in GOV/PM... If so, I'll yield, and I'll give support to boosting the knowledge base of new political members on Verdant, via GOV/PM, Why? Cuz it's an extremely niche topic within the whole Prun game.


[11-Dec-24 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**realbandit**:	If you started on Promitor last time it'll be similar early game, just a lot further from the CX


[13-Dec-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	Yeah, Promitor is a lot more convenient, that's for sure.


[13-Dec-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Verdant is a great supporting planet for bases on Montem and Vallis - little tougher to start with though. Do you have PRO to use the LM?


[13-Dec-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I'm going to buy Pro again tomorrow.


[13-Dec-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I've been pro for most of my play time.


[13-Dec-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I just wanted to get away from the Insitor ecosystem. I was a founder of COSM which has grown a lot.


[13-Dec-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Moria is the better region, so that also makes sense ;)


[13-Dec-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I know a few players from COSM, so that's interesting you founded it


[13-Dec-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	Moria is kind of nice I guess, but I plan to go up, not down.


[13-Dec-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Well, the LM here is decent, but expect the start to be a bit slower than Promitor. Got any planets in mind to expand to already?


[13-Dec-24 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	harpina for hydrogen (plastics for clothing) and later argon for INS


[13-Dec-24 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	skipping arcadia because hauling iron is not fun


[13-Dec-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	once I have just a small amount of hydrogen, verdant should be able to provide non-luxury PIO goods for me to expand up north to Saladin and Outer Heaven etc


[13-Dec-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	just have to buy construction materials


[13-Dec-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	any good planet for that nearby outside faction space


[13-Dec-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Basing a lot around Verdant then I see. There's a few corps who do the same if you're interested, they could help you a lot more if you're interested.


[13-Dec-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	not too many planets that I know of, XG-326a is a good spot for MCG production


[13-Dec-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	But most construction happens closer in to Moria


[13-Dec-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	looks like I'll be doing my construction on Hubur d


[13-Dec-24 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	2-3d trip out there


[13-Dec-24 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-24 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kamalgar**:	Hi Guys, Quick question, If I put up contracts for shipping from Verdant to MOR. Is there any more popular size of shipping? I understand 500/500 as a maximum is popular but would it be more popular to leave a little space for other stuff like 400/400 and/or 450/450?


[16-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Breaking it down into smaller packets increases chances someone has space for you


[16-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	1000/1000 is good one too, all 3 users of WCB, VCB and LCB can pick them up


[16-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I usually try to size mine around 200 for the larger value.  I mostly ship O in 228/200 shipments and C in 225/100.  They usually get picked up within a couple of days.


[16-Dec-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Shipping from Verdant is free, so there's not a lot of downside to posting smaller packages.


[16-Dec-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kamalgar**:	Thanks guys


[17-Dec-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the whole "I have 500t to ship but it's 5 different things" is really a shame tbh


[17-Dec-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	no way to package multiple different things into a shipment makes it really hard for manufacturing/electronics worlds and stuff

[17-Dec-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well... I myself use the free WAR space, to "package" goodies... If I want to ship 500 t/m3 of a given mix.. I just balance it out in the separate WAR inventory... Issue LM conts, and then just shove everything back into my base, so that nothing runs out-of-stock,


[17-Dec-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	All other things I've got memorized... 2380 RAT per 500 t/3... 5000 DW per 500 t/m3... and so on.


[17-Dec-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And @Retread shipping from YI-715b is not exactly "free", per se... You're still going to have to pay ppl for their time + effort... But it'ts still cheaper than shipping stuff in from @ MOR. :/


[17-Dec-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kamalgar**:	Thanks for the clarificaton and help Roh. I think dakota1234 was more referring to bundle different resources in one unique shipment. For example RAT and DW under one black box and therefor one contract.


[17-Dec-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hmm, If you've got exports to send, just list them.. I think in PMMG+ or rPrun (browser extensions), you get the $/t estimates... Post them anyways if you have time.. People should pick them up within a few days anways.


[17-Dec-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We're currently limited, via game coding, of one unique commodity, per shipping contract. You just can't escape it with out current system in Prun.


[17-Dec-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@molp -- why is shipping limited to one commodity, per contract?


[17-Dec-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Post that question on the Prun forums. :P


[17-Dec-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	We need to produce and buy SHC - Shipping Containers :)))


[17-Dec-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bobnobrain**:	Hey guys! If anyone wants to expand into metallurgy, now is your time! I offer a grant of 150k NCC for every willing player in exchange of a promise to settle their base on Arcadia (YI-683c)! (please note that PRO/BASIC is required for direct contracts like this)


[27-Jan-25 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	The benefits of Arcadia as a metallurgy planet include:


[27-Jan-25 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	- low environmental construction costs: you only need SEA which is very cheap


[27-Jan-25 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	- nice amounts of FEO and SIO available for extraction on-site


[27-Jan-25 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	- close proximity to Verdant system, which is a great source of O and C needed for smelting


[27-Jan-25 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	- and, of course, CoGC program running metallurgy 24/7


[27-Jan-25 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	If you are interested, dm me in-game, or in Discord (I'm in official and UFO servers), and I will send you a contract!

**goofus**:	Is there a reason population is going down?


[12-Feb-25 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yes.


[12-Feb-25 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yes. Unemployed pops are being culled because they don't contribute to players but still take up POPI inputs to maintain. We're going with a calibrated approach of using a large happiness boost every few weeks to maintain a buffer, and letting the pop go down in between.


[12-Feb-25 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Btw guys does anyone want free 150k NCC?


[12-Feb-25 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sure


[12-Feb-25 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	Is reduced population related to the decline in agricultural commodity prices on Moria?


[12-Feb-25 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	planetary population is only related to what you see on the POPR, available jobs and workforce happiness.


[12-Feb-25 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	workforce is an NPC function, they're not players - driven solely by the provisions and programs on the planet (which is managed by players)


[12-Feb-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there is no universal limit to how many workers spawn


[12-Feb-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	Does that mean population is related to the number of players?

**goofus**:	Is there an economic explanation of why the price of GRN is going down?


[12-Feb-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	and if it will continue to drop?


[12-Feb-25 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	well considering 300 is moderately high, 400 is way high - so, yes, even with the recent inflation across all markets, one should expect it to drop


[12-Feb-25 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	GRN has 4 uses - burning for C production, food processing for RAT or fermenting for ALE or GIN production


[12-Feb-25 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	I looked at the chart, I did not realize that January prices were so high.


[12-Feb-25 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	Prices could fall quite a bit.


[12-Feb-25 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	they tend to go up faster than the subsequent decline


[12-Feb-25 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	Why was there inflation in January?


[12-Feb-25 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**goofus**:	New players entering the game?


[12-Feb-25 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	more like old players leaving the game I would think, less supply, higher prices....though both have an effect


[12-Feb-25 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	new players entering is the only source of new money into the markets (other than the limited MM buys)


[12-Feb-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there's also simple greed - which is contagious - nobody wants to be the only guy in the room selling at a fair price - when the entire market is in inflated, the "fair price" increases too.


[12-Feb-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	@Zugore the grant is given for establishing base on YI-683c Arcadia, if you're interested, I'll send you the contract


[12-Feb-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	You sure have a spare permit there :)


[12-Feb-25 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have two spare permits, but no interest in Arcadia.


[12-Feb-25 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, that's a shame


[12-Feb-25 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Besides, when I drop a base, I drop the full 500 in one shot (which I'm not sure your POPR could handle)...I have FEO @ OZ-189a, will have SIO via AML's in a couple weeks, and no need of Sulfur as yet.


[12-Feb-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Sulfur there is close to non-existent, definitely not recommend it for that


[12-Feb-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And POPR can be adjusted with prior notice ;)


[12-Feb-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But you're pretty set up, so you probably don't need another planet here


[12-Feb-25 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And 150k must be pretty negligible :D


[12-Feb-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, it was more a j/k then a serious request - was expecting you to pick up on that straight away. Everyone likes free money.


[12-Feb-25 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	btw YI-280j is a hilarious planet


[12-Feb-25 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	BER ->AML = SIO, AL, BE - BE sells well, AL good for pp2 and mfg, SIO mfg


[12-Feb-25 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	No, I'm not about its use, I'm about its position in the system


[12-Feb-25 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Try to find it on MS YI-280 :D


[12-Feb-25 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	noticed that - was doing an old survey mission the other day at yi-280f - tried to go direct between the two, it was going to take two weeks; I just jumped to verdant and back in a matter of a few hours


[12-Feb-25 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, on the sysi map you've got to scroll way out


[12-Feb-25 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah it's practically it's own system at that point (in terms of travel time)


[12-Feb-25 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yup, you can't even zoom out enough to fit it's orbit lol


[12-Feb-25 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the BEN system is like that too, quicker to jump out and back in


[12-Feb-25 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I guess any planet with orbital radius more than 5 au is like that

**johnbecool**:	how to create a second base ?


[02-Mar-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	anyone can answer ?


[02-Mar-25 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	go to the new planet with the building materials and click start base on the planet page


[02-Mar-25 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	1 base per planet


[02-Mar-25 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can expand each base up to 3 permits


[02-Mar-25 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	first permit grants 500 area, +250 area for each additional permit


[02-Mar-25 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**johnbecool**:	thx for answering ; second stage: i sold to the community exchange : when will i be paid ?


[02-Mar-25 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You don't sell _to_ the exchange, you sell to other players.  You list your commodity on the exchange, and when someone buys it, you get paid immediately.  If you want to get paid right away, set your sale price to the price of the highest bid.


[02-Mar-25 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	ok!! thx


[02-Mar-25 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	a realistic stock exchange !! more layers = better for the moves !!


[02-Mar-25 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	technically, not a stock exchange but a commodities exchange.


[02-Mar-25 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	lol


[02-Mar-25 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	stock exchanges originally were paper to buy and sell commodities not those from now ...


[03-Mar-25 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	not possible to change the offer made at the commodity exchange ?


[03-Mar-25 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Nope, but you can delete it and place a new one


[03-Mar-25 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	no. You can delete it only


[03-Mar-25 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**johnbecool**:	how to delete: do i retrieve the not sold materials ?


[03-Mar-25 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Mar-25 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Why would you think we need afabs here?


[06-Mar-25 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Not many run ORCs, and those that do most likely have their own sources of afabs


[06-Mar-25 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And 20% mark up isn't worth when compared to transporting it ourselves


[06-Mar-25 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	A 20% markup on the cheapest fab (BTA) means a 740/m3 shipping fee, so most probably only those who need the prefabs immediately would be willing to pay that price


[07-Mar-25 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bobnobrain**:	I've bought myself 200 BDE on Moria and paid 4000 NCC to deliver them, how much would that be?


[07-Mar-25 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Less than 1%, if I'm not mistaken


[07-Mar-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	454000


[07-Mar-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	just under 1%, yeah


[07-Mar-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And the more expensive it gets, the less the percentage, as shipping cost does not depend on the cost of what's being shipped


[07-Mar-25 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	on the other hand, i try not to ship too much value at once, in case a random pirate pops up


[07-Mar-25 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, I guess selling here at Moria ask would work


[07-Mar-25 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	so when i have lots of value to move, i do pay more (and it takes longer)


[07-Mar-25 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	My find on what sells fine on LM is popular inputs/repair mats for the planet, slightly cheaper than CX ask


[07-Mar-25 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But that will work only if you produce them closer to here than to CX


[07-Mar-25 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-25 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
