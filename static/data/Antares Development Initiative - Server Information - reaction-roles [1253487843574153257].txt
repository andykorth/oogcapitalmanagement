## How to self-assign planet roles:
* First, you need to check what planet roles are available. This is done by running the command `!roles` in #bot-spam 
* Using that list as a guide, run the `!planet[planet name]` command for any planets you see that you're also on.
 * The custom command used doesn't accept spaces, keep the entire thing one word.
 * Example: `!planeticestationalpha`
