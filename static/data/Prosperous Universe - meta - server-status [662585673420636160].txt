Just a heads-up: our hosting provider has a maintenance window tonight. If the game is briefly unavailable, that’ll likely be the cause.

We are about to release the next maintenance release, so expect a short downtime and some hiccups (https://com.prosperousuniverse.com/t/release-notes-maintenance-02/1969)


[29-Jan-20 09:14 AM] molp#0000
The maintenance release is complete, let us know if you run into issues


[30-Jan-20 01:49 AM] lunikon#0000
one more small patch after yesterday's release that should help with some of the performance issues we're seeing


[30-Jan-20 01:50 AM] lunikon#0000
should hit the servers in a couple of minutes


[30-Jan-20 01:59 AM] lunikon#0000
done. Let's see whether that helps.

turns out to be a bit bumpier than I anticipated


[24-Mar-20 03:23 AM] lunikon#0000
turns out that we missed a few minor versions of Kubernetes and our hosting provider only allows to upgrade to the latest one by stepping through all intermediate versions


[24-Mar-20 03:23 AM] lunikon#0000
meaning: please expect somewhat frequent and longer downtimes over the course of the day. Sorry about that!

Sorry about the on-going performance issues everyone! Something in this week's release must have caused it but we haven't figured out what it is just yet. Until then, I'm afraid there will be more or less regular performance degradations about which we can do little more than reboot the servers. Thank you very much for your understanding...we're trying to resolve the issue as quickly as we can!

Just a quick reminder: we have identified a performance problem that leads to a server reboot every 24 hours or so. In most cases the reboot will work just fine, in rare cases the navigation subsystem does not work afterwards. If you cannot calculate flights after a restart (please give it 5-10 minutes to start up), please ping us. We'll try to fix the performance issue as soon as possible.

Quick heads-up, although I don't really expect anyone to notice: Our new ops partners (might have to name-drop them in a devlog one day) will be migrating our forums to a new server shortly. So there might be a few minutes of downtime. Game and website will remain unaffected.
