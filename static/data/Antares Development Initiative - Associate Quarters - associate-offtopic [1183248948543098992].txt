difficult to follow a conversation....


[05-Jan-24 04:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sorry, I'm rushing, expand your base fully, so you use all 500 of your available space, or have you done that already


[05-Jan-24 04:46 PM] havanista#0000
i have a few left why


[05-Jan-24 04:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Expand to the full 500 space, on the house (free of charge)


[05-Jan-24 04:47 PM] havanista#0000
yeah i still some prefab for it


[05-Jan-24 04:48 PM] havanista#0000

So:
#trading  ~ If you want to buy something, here you go
#internal-offers  ~ If you mass produce anything and want to sell it over here you can put it there with a Unit Price
#associate-offtopic ~  Just talking really 🤷‍♂️ 
#bot-spam  ~ Fido for all your Fido needs, if you need more help with that you can ask, you can also use 'help in the botspam channels 
#associate-planning  ~ If you have any great ideas or want help you can go here

The above goes for the member channels too

AGP ~ A grant for all members and associates in ANT space, value changes best to ask at the time of joining, there is a waiting list and short list, grants are filled and payed out *de pecuniis praesentibus*.
As it is a grant there is no expectation of repayment, more detailed information can be found in #agp-information along with the waiting list.

GAS ~ A project in ANT based around Metallurgy, @avalock  is currently running the only bases
There is a shortlist/waiting list somewhere 

Please do not type in the information channels unless you know your allowed to, for neatness sake.

(Carbon always makes money)


[23-Jan-24 02:54 PM] jvaler#0000
carbon on nascent will let you extract ALO there too, so you can dedicate your entire smelting base to smelting and make better use of COGC and experts

[23-Jan-24 07:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah the travel stuff is unexpectedly complex and impressive. It's one of the reasons that travel time/fuel consumption is one of the only unknown factors that the community hasn't fully developed a tool to mimic. planet size, gravity, stars, and a ton of other moving factors make it insanely difficult to estimate. so cool

{Reactions}
😮 

[23-Jan-24 07:13 PM] tanda#0000
I'm confused, it doesn't look like you can do much more than process greens into carbon on Nascent, due to the lack of fertility. am I missing something?


[23-Jan-24 07:14 PM] jvaler#0000
that's right. you grow the agri on harmonia and ship it to nascent


[23-Jan-24 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
alright, then it looks like that's a stretch goal at the moment


[23-Jan-24 07:20 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe. basic advice is to adhere to your planet's COGC for it's bonus. it's very powerful and not to be underestimated like i did when i was new. but that's not always feasable when you don't have the capital to make a whole new base just for INC, sometimes you need something to make money in the interim.

just know that the EXT you have on deimos currently may likely be demolished in the future, and you reclaim less construction materials from them the longer you wait


[23-Jan-24 07:23 PM] tanda#0000
understood


[23-Jan-24 07:23 PM] jvaler#0000
return on investment may be better away from COGC, but maximum value you can get out of 500 base area is almost always higher with COGC


[23-Jan-24 07:24 PM] tanda#0000
I think before I start running an extraction base with no smelters, I'd like to upgrade my ships first


[23-Jan-24 07:24 PM] tanda#0000
that seems like a super big pain with starter cargo holds


[23-Jan-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
EXT on deimos with no SME? that's actually incredibly easy logistics. just sell it on the LM! no logi required


[23-Jan-24 07:26 PM] phoenix_eternal#0000
yup


[23-Jan-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
running rate is ~75/u on deimos. that's what i bought at before i got my nascent base


[23-Jan-24 07:26 PM] phoenix_eternal#0000
plenty of people that'll buy ALO


[23-Jan-24 07:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I made my first million through selling ALO on deimos lm at 95/u.


[23-Jan-24 07:29 PM] jvaler#0000
there's people with max EXT on deimos that sell ALO on the LM to people with max SME making AL. it's like an ecosystem lol


[23-Jan-24 07:29 PM] tanda#0000
my current setup is hybrid at this point


[23-Jan-24 07:29 PM] tanda#0000
extraction and smelting


[23-Jan-24 07:31 PM] jvaler#0000
the actual reason that's discouraged is experts. you can only assign max experts (5) to a single industry, having 2 industries means you miss out on the very powerful 4th and 5th experts on at least one of those industries. https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html#experts

okay, I can definitely plan on demolishing my extractors at some point


[23-Jan-24 07:32 PM] jvaler#0000
i should have worded this differently though. ALO EXT on deimos is against COGC but still very viable. it honestly depends. the bigger issue is not having that 5th expert by doing both


[23-Jan-24 07:34 PM] tanda#0000
I guess the question is: Is this something that can be corrected down the line. If I later demolish extractors and unassign extraction experts, will I still be able to get the 5th expert for metallurgy or is the base permanent stuck with half and half


[23-Jan-24 07:36 PM] jvaler#0000
yes you can assign and unassign experts at will, you're never locked out of anything


[23-Jan-24 07:37 PM] tanda#0000
alright. Then I will work on gettting the bases and actions I want onto the correct planets, It's gonna take a bit


[23-Jan-24 07:37 PM] jvaler#0000
best of luck


[23-Jan-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
thank you


[23-Jan-24 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can in theory get 5 experts for every type on one base if you wanted to.


[23-Jan-24 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which I may be tempted to do at some point in the very distant future as a bucket list goal.


[23-Jan-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
That sounds long, convoluted, and tiring, lol

[23-Jan-24 07:56 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but *where*


[23-Jan-24 07:57 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you'd want a planet with a CoGC that helps with the slowest category, and probably also one that you can put RIGs on for the fast RE experts


[23-Jan-24 08:02 PM] jvaler#0000
pioneer COGC lmaoo

{Reactions}
😆 

[23-Jan-24 08:13 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
only if you're trying to do them all at once. I'd honestly build a 3 permit base on a planet where you can decide the CoGC and do it one expert type at a time. Calculate how many buildings you need to get the 5th expert right before the ideal repair time, then demo everything instead of repairing. Use the reclaimed parts to start the next one. PIO CoGC also wouldn't cover electronics...


[23-Jan-24 08:18 PM] jvaler#0000
are there even any uninhabited triple green planets left?


[23-Jan-24 08:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, a few. A lot of them are far away, but I know that the devs adjusted a few uninhabited planets a while back, made them triple green, and nobody has moved in yet


[23-Jan-24 08:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think someone here recently mentioned one between Antares and Benten too


[23-Jan-24 09:08 PM] jvaler#0000
just searched it up on FIO, i had no idea hermes existed


[23-Jan-24 09:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Never heard of that one. CoGC?


[23-Jan-24 09:09 PM] jvaler#0000
empty cogc!


[23-Jan-24 09:09 PM] jvaler#0000
actually it'd be really cool to use it with demeter, they're like right next to each other


[23-Jan-24 09:09 PM] jvaler#0000
oh but it is gaseous fwiw


[23-Jan-24 09:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
HSE isn't to bad depending on the type of base. Does Demeter have CoGC?


[23-Jan-24 09:10 PM] jvaler#0000
HSE? u mean AEF?


[23-Jan-24 09:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

That's what I'm doing with Pyrgos+Tacotopia but that shipping sucks

[23-Jan-24 09:19 PM] jvaler#0000

[23-Jan-24 09:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
😆 I didn't even realize that's the area it's in. I was governor in KI-401 for a month when PiBoy was setting that system up. Everything there is RE or Construction for making INS, so you could also settle cold planets there for cheap


[23-Jan-24 09:22 PM] jvaler#0000
well lemme see...


[23-Jan-24 09:29 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't see anything particularly interesting that becomes viable with that information


[23-Jan-24 09:29 PM] jvaler#0000
at least in the general area


[23-Jan-24 09:31 PM] jvaler#0000
and demeter seems to be the only planet with water in the area so HYF are an iffy prospect


[23-Jan-24 09:52 PM] jvaler#0000

[23-Jan-24 09:53 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm sure it'll be fine


[23-Jan-24 09:54 PM] jvaler#0000
actually wait i definitely need a third ship to do this since it's so far out


[23-Jan-24 09:55 PM] jvaler#0000
that'll be pricey


[23-Jan-24 10:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah the shipping is important, definitely learn from my mistakes and don't outgrow your shipping capacity, it's stressful. 

I feel you with the gov thing though, I was a puppet for PiBoy, which was interesting practice but not *super* helpful since they were literally the only person on the planet 😆 but familiarizing myself with the new screens was nice. Now I'm gonna be gov of a 250k pop starter planet 😅🙃 what have I gotten myself into, lol


[23-Jan-24 10:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
You'd need to build an ADM there first to become gov

So, I'm a little confused about shipping contracts. Are they only for posting cargo to be shipped? Is there an option for ppl with cargo space to post an offer for shipping?

In game? No.

You can try posting on some PrUn discords you have some free space along with the price but that's about it.

Maybe try planetary or global chat too.


[24-Jan-24 07:00 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
Ok. I've seen things like 10/t , is that the reasonable offer?


[24-Jan-24 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
I remember seeing 20/t is the usual but it all depends on distance, total weight, and if there's any backhaul.

[24-Jan-24 02:10 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I had the same thought for a spare ship. Give it the designation ADI [name] and use it for ADI member contracts and ADI-customer contracts. Maybe even put a little fluff text about using ADI for transport and supply needs so the name gets bigger and we secure our

Maybe I'd even fund entirely new ships for people if it got popular.


[24-Jan-24 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
My reasoning behind it is simple - most of us go to the same places somewhat often, we may as well help cut down on costs and repairs.


[24-Jan-24 02:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
In KAWA some of us post things like this so we can coordinate shipping. You could go even further though and set up "corp shipping routes" where people can queue up for shipments and take turns flying routes

Not sure if it will fill your needs but we use Lucid Chart (or something with a similar name) at work, works well enough for large charts or diagrams for lectures, the colors are also a bit limited though

[24-Jan-24 08:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think an ADI shipping schedule would definitely be a fun experiment, especially for common routes like Harmonia <> ANT. Have 2 queues, one for ships and one for cargo.
ships: join the queue by adding your name and how big your ship is
cargo: add cargo to the queue by adding the t/m of shipping needs

once the cargo t/m totals more than the next ship in line, get contracts and go, repeat.

would be really great for newer players who tend to fly with only partially full ships. If the shipping fees were minimal, like 5 AIC/t just to cover fuel, then it would free up a lot of ships to go pick up other shipping contracts and actually be cheaper than everyone shipping for themselves ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I'd love to do it honestly.

I think you have an acronym addiction 😝  I like it. Maybe just start a google sheet with instruction and a sign up queue and see who bites


[24-Jan-24 08:52 PM] tanda#0000
I volunteer, but I only have starter ships at this point


[24-Jan-24 08:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think that's all we'd really need


[24-Jan-24 08:53 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
One of the cooles parts of this is that it would benefit new players most, and also be run completely by new players.


[24-Jan-24 08:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Once you have lots of things to ship it's easier just to do it yourself and your ships are more busy. Early on you aren't sending full ships, and you have ship's just idling.


[24-Jan-24 08:55 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Honestly, we could just ship everything with cheap 1 AIC contracts then maybe have some older volunteers supply all the fuel. I'd definitely be down to pitch some in.


[24-Jan-24 08:56 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ whatever makes the most sense, I do think it's needs to stay simple to work though


[24-Jan-24 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
We could do it where we just let it run the course through the new players and I can just cover fuel costs as people send me in requests.


[24-Jan-24 09:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

we have a sheet that tracks routes (links to these sheets). If there's regular community shipping needed on a certain route we make a new one of these sheets for the route. If there's enough cargo to fill the progress bar, the person who's turn it is to ship (top of the "SHIPS" list) takes the contracts, removes their name and all shipped goods from the list, and repeat

Maybe, threads could be useful but I feel like if the spreadsheet is done correctly there shouldn't *need* to be so much conversation.


[25-Jan-24 07:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
If everything is displayed on the spreadsheet and is actively updated, that'd pretty much alleviate most needs to talk, other than maybe a simple (i'm here @ (insert planet), etc.)

But depending on what you can get out of FIO that may also get automated.

How do starter planets work exactly? iirc they only gave me 2-3 options to start out in ANT. Does that list ever change?


[25-Jan-24 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Starter planets are typically faction/lore based.


[25-Jan-24 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
They don't really change and are set at the start of the universe iirc.


[25-Jan-24 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
They are typically the most recommended for new players to start on, although some aren't exactly ideal.


[25-Jan-24 08:11 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
And you can also technically fly your starting supplies to any planet you like...

[25-Jan-24 08:20 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I figured, I was just brainstorming about settling new-newish players into east antares. We likely won't catch new players before they settle their first base, but we can recommend further expansions in that direction. I'm thinking by the time any real infrastructure and propositions get set up, we'll have plenty of new players ready for a second+ base


[25-Jan-24 08:25 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I'd hesitate to recommend a coliq to ppl a day or two into the game. However, coliq+grant+recommended planet in E.ANT would be a faster settlement program and ensure that first bases are in the interest of all of ADI


[25-Jan-24 08:25 AM] jvaler#0000

I COLIQd twice, then still packed up my whole base and restarted a third time, and I recommend it to everyone. I think it's really beneficial to learn the game a bit then restart with a more informed plan

[25-Jan-24 05:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yep. people flock to the cheap ones, lol. And having an established ADM, warehouse, LM, and CoGC is super nice. Starting up new systems and planets can be really fun, but you generally have to be really rich or go into it as a group.


[25-Jan-24 05:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've considered picking a super conveniently located, but expensive planet and just building a bunch of STO... use it for my growing horde of materials. Wouldn't have to pay WH fees and wouldn't even have to repair it, so the expensive initial build cost would be the *only* cost (other than a permit, which isn't nothing). ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ some day


[25-Jan-24 05:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

basically everything except CL is *super* easy to ship for it's value


[25-Jan-24 05:44 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I also might be able to supply you with some cheaper DDT too. I don't make *much* excess, but I did just expand my chem base so I'm making enough to share a little now


[25-Jan-24 05:47 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I'm sure my first couple of bases are gonna roll through the different professions. The MAT production pathways make it a given for self-sufficiency. Yea if I'm ever in need of cheaper DDT I'll hit you up


[25-Jan-24 05:48 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
Also, just found out you get MATs back from demolishing buildings. Neat, less to buy later lol

{Reactions}
💯 

[25-Jan-24 05:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it's a percentage of mats the original mats based on the condition of the building. Sometimes if I don't need to produce something long term I'll build a base and just run it for ~80d. That's when I would normally repair it, so I just demo instead and rebuild


[25-Jan-24 05:51 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've rebuild Deimos 3 times now because I can't make up my mind and don't want a second metal base 😅


[25-Jan-24 05:54 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I'm excited to go into metallurgy, it's such a classic production chain for games. Although I'll probably go EXT first, so you can rethink that metal base a 4th time 🤘

{Reactions}

[25-Jan-24 06:04 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Currently I've got 3 FS, 4 GF, and 9 SME. It's not nearly enough for my needs now but I'm hoping I can set up some long term deals with other corpmates on Deimos so I don't have to do more, lol. I miss the first version when it was just 0 thought COL/EXT/SME. Feed C, get AL. Now I've got about 20 different inputs on that base 😭


[25-Jan-24 06:10 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
Yea, the production chains are kind of bonkers, considering this isn't your average game where you unlock SME after EXT or some such. I've yet to see a good chain visual....so of course I'm making my own for reference lol. I'm leaning towards EXT -> Deimos, maybe even supplement the GAS project for my second base


[25-Jan-24 06:22 PM] jvaler#0000
have you considered vulcan?


[25-Jan-24 06:24 PM] jvaler#0000
it's an HSE planet so FS are a good option


[25-Jan-24 06:32 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I offered to drop off some MATs to one of our members. It will be my first contract made. What's the process for that kind of thing? Sell contract for 1 AIC or something else?


[25-Jan-24 06:42 PM] jvaler#0000
that's standard yeah


[25-Jan-24 06:44 PM] jvaler#0000
though if you're really granular like me you can sell for 0.01 AIC instead of 1 by using the sell template and setting it to 0.01 AIC per item and 1 item. then you just modify the item and amount but not the price

nobody really cares though, i just like the look of it


[25-Jan-24 07:05 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I have yeah, that's where I buy my FEO and now I'm not really making any AL anyway, just FE for STL/MFK/etc. I've got plenty of AL supplier options so if I *do* end up caving in and building another metalurgy base, it will almost certainly be on Vulcan

I can't decide what to start working on for my expansions lol. I keep teetering between KOM production or just sticking with more C


[28-Jan-24 06:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
On the same base or next? If you're making C there's a lot of paths that opens. Look into an expansion that uses the C, like smelting, some chemistry, PE, etc. C can be expensive for others and you have it cheap so can use that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ if you're talking about the same base though, just stick to whatever the chamber of global commerce boosts


[28-Jan-24 06:25 PM] moke.#0000
On the next


[28-Jan-24 06:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I started with C then built bases making PE and Chem stuff since I had the C


[28-Jan-24 06:26 PM] moke.#0000
I'm half selling the C to a friend on the cheap to help him out, so I don't necessarily want to use it


[28-Jan-24 06:27 PM] moke.#0000
I'm just trying to feel it out 😅 bit of decision paralysis


[28-Jan-24 06:30 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
More C is never bad then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ unless you're struggling with shipping.


[28-Jan-24 06:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KOM is good money now but starting to stabilize so who knows if that's good long term


[28-Jan-24 07:14 PM] moke.#0000
Yeah. Thats what is getting me to hesitate lol. But even then I can probably just as easily pivot into something else that comes out of farms/fermenters


[28-Jan-24 07:49 PM] okamicheems1#0000
I'm currently focusing on KOM, where should I pivot next after saving up about 2 weeks profit


[28-Jan-24 07:51 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ what's your setup now?


[28-Jan-24 07:54 PM] okamicheems1#0000
Off the top it's 3 h2o rigs, 3 herb farms, 2 fermenter and an auxiliary food processor for basic needs


[28-Jan-24 09:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
depends on the direction you want to go. Right now you're pretty self-sufficient, which is great for shipping and resilience, but not great for profit. out of those 9 buildings only 3 are getting the +25% production bonus from Harmonia's CoGC (Agriculture). *Personally* I would recommend filling up the rest of your first 500 area base with FRMs, they will make you the most money. Buy your H2O and anything else on the CX. Once you expand to another planet maybe consider building your FP and FERs on Norwick and replacing the ones on Harmonia (and the RIGs) with more agriculture buildings. That would give you some amount of self-sufficiency *and* synergize with planet bonuses for the most profit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[29-Jan-24 11:22 PM] okamicheems1#0000
In the future would it be worth it to set up a base on an ice station purely for H2O


[30-Jan-24 02:28 AM] jvaler#0000

The corresponding prompt generated:
Create a logo for a corporation called Antares Development Initiative. The corporation is part of a fictional game, rooted in Mars, Roman, and Greek mythology. It specializes in the mining and refining of aluminum and provides grants to the local people. The logo should incorporate thematic elements such as the planet Mars, classical Roman or Greek symbols like laurels or a helmet, and mining or aluminum elements. The colors should be inspired by the attached logo, primarily using shades of red, orange, and black, with a star representing Antares, which should be a prominent feature. The design should be clean, modern, and symbolize progress and innovation.

Ok... next time I fire up inkscape... imagine the last one, no lettering.  1 : 1.25 aspect ratio.
Bottom left is the gear / industry motif.  Bottom right ... since that's where Antares tends to show up in maps gets the expansion motif from the overly complicated upper left.  The center gets one of the circular shields (I'm partial to the dish).

out of the ones at 20/day and above with MCG, SEA, HSE and INS only as building materials, there are 2 at <5j from moria, one with INS, and 1 at <5j of Benten, also with INS, and they're all under 25/day. There are 4 at <5j from Antares, only 1 INS, and 3 of them are 28/day or more

i had no idea aceland had ALO lol


[31-Jan-24 05:21 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm glad i picked ANT by pure luck lol, i only avoided the other 3 factions for dumb aesthetic reasons


[31-Jan-24 05:22 PM] jvaler#0000
though i'm upset AI has a shitty faction bonus

I was thinking about if it makes sense to go settle a planet near moria and produce aluminium there


[31-Jan-24 05:23 PM] jvaler#0000
which one?

[31-Jan-24 05:24 PM] limp_wristed#0000
but maybe making AL in AI space would make more sense if they're not very good


[31-Jan-24 05:26 PM] limp_wristed#0000
Celebdil doesn't look bad though. 21 al/day, resource extraction COGC, 4j from the CX


[31-Jan-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
oh celebdil looks good. 25% less ALO than nascent but ~1.75x the sell value


[31-Jan-24 05:42 PM] jvaler#0000
though it's also a SEA planet which is a factor

like i said. My plan was to start fresh anyway.  Starting with a tiny bit more insight and confidence


[03-Feb-24 07:41 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think that's the way to go honestly. I restated twice and always recommend that people give it some time then start with a plan. Give it time though and research the industry and area you want to restart in


[03-Feb-24 07:58 AM] kegoscho#0000

Consider that you'll never be woken up at 2am by Australis saying "I need more AL now! Moria is doing a sale and we need to make sure they don't gain market cap..."


[03-Feb-24 05:20 PM] limp_wristed#0000
my alliance is pretty chill, i only have to go onto the fleets i'm awake for :p


[03-Feb-24 05:26 PM] shagie#0000
If you're going to spin down... deconstruct the production buildings.  That way you don't use consumables and when you want to scratch _this_ itch again before free deletion registration time happens ("Accounts more than 14 days old will be notified after 31 days of inactivity and deleted 21 days afterwards") you can spin it up again by rebuilding the buildings (less repair costs - but it will get you started again).


[03-Feb-24 05:55 PM] limp_wristed#0000
good call


[03-Feb-24 07:07 PM] kegoscho#0000
looking at my first go as a metallurgy. what are the best first steps after the "tutorial" ? last time  I build another Smelter and got some supplies for my worker. 

but whats the main thing i should focus on at the beginning


[03-Feb-24 07:14 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're coming right out of the tutorial i assume you haven't bought FLX and switched over to the AL recipe that uses it yet, right? that should be something to do asap. think of it as converting 1 FLX into 1 AL, it's very good

more generally just keep building SME and the HB1 to support them. i recommend prunplanner as a tool to help you visualize and explore your options (https://prunplanner.org/). when doing so keep in mind that industry specialization is powerful due to the mechanics of how the experts and the COGC work (https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html#experts and https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html#cogc-programs), though there may be cases where deviating from the specialization is worthwhile.


[03-Feb-24 07:33 PM] kegoscho#0000
have not switched yet but it  was my plan to do so. 
that are some good links thanks 
yea i looked into the prunplanner for a second. but i think i need to watch a tutorial 😄

When starting the game, my current Workforce size is 200.  building HB1 the capacity increases (to 200). by building more the capacity  will get more right? Will the actual Workforce size increases automatically , over time or is that something to worry about? or do I just build SME and HB1 on and on


[03-Feb-24 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
You build your habitat and whatever tier you need, and then you build your production building using the same population.


[03-Feb-24 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
After that you have a small reserve of pops that will come to work for you, on some well settled planets you'll have no issue filling the requirement.


[03-Feb-24 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
On some slower planets you need to wait for the POPR which ticks each week and will allow you to gain some more pops.


[03-Feb-24 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
On most planets it'll only take one or two POPRs to reach full workforce need, but some can take longer.


[03-Feb-24 07:36 PM] kegoscho#0000
ah ok i see, thanks


[03-Feb-24 08:50 PM] shagie#0000

[04-Feb-24 04:40 AM] kegoscho#0000
ok


[04-Feb-24 04:46 AM] kegoscho#0000
so my next steps should be to just up my Metal production for now. Getting the recourses and filling up my available space ?


[04-Feb-24 04:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'd say that's a good place to start.


[04-Feb-24 04:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can use prunplanner to get an idea of the costs.


[04-Feb-24 04:59 AM] kegoscho#0000
Then upgrading HQ for more Permits and filling that space too 

yea already tinkering with the planer


[04-Feb-24 06:58 AM] kegoscho#0000
when designing the base. whats the preferred approach. 
for excample: max and as high as possible AL output but buying everything/some from outside to keep it up
And then use that AL to make something different and sell

or  lower the AL output but make my own Carbon, O, DW

according to the planer the ROI would be roughly the same


[04-Feb-24 08:43 AM] jvaler#0000
you can expect ~40k/d from maxing SME, ~44k/d if you buy your ALO from the deimos LM at 75/u instead of 90/u off the CX. that also happens to remove a *lot* of the logistical demands of importing all that ALO

alternatively if you make your own ALO and O (10 SME 6 EXT 2 COL) you make ~32k/d. definitely worse profit-wise, but a reasonable option for someone without LM access or much logistical capability.
do note 2 starter ships is plenty capable of supplying a 20 SME base purely from the CX though

RIGs on deimos for H2O (for agri from FRMs or DW from FP) is just a bad idea though. the best i could come up with is 6 SME, 3 EXT, 1 COL, 4 INC, 2 FRM, 1 FP, 5 RIG for almost full self-sufficiency. it's even worse than 32k/d at ~28k/d

❤️ 

[04-Feb-24 08:57 AM] kegoscho#0000
Oh wow ok
Then I have definitely made a big  mistake while using the planner
My base cost were nearly identical but with 35day roi

20 is the hardcap of SME or buildings in general?
Cause you have used just 500 Area.
Or is the next step just expanding into different buildings and products with the AL

And thanks for the helpful insights❤️


[04-Feb-24 09:01 AM] jvaler#0000
i highly reccomend either manually inputting all relevant prices in CX settings, or using AI1 BUY for both automatic buy and sell prices. incorrect pricing is a common error made 
(CX request orders are often skewed very low compared to a good's actual value. CX offer orders are much more reflective of a good's value)

20 is the limit due to the 500 area restrictions. to have the SME, the HB1 to support them, and adequate storage (1 STO will work, but 2 fit) 20 SME becomes the maximum


[04-Feb-24 09:06 AM] jvaler#0000
what i mean by AI1 buy for both buy and sell btw

[04-Feb-24 09:12 AM] kegoscho#0000
ah ok i get it. will look into the prices 

Regarding the area I might have misunderstood something 
cant you just add another permit and have a bigger area. in this case 750?

[04-Feb-24 09:13 AM] kegoscho#0000
or do i better use the permits for another planet down the line


[04-Feb-24 09:13 AM] jvaler#0000
you can, but it's less efficient to do so than to just make a second base. adding on a 2nd and 3rd permit to an existing base gives you 250 area per permit, whereas making a new base gives you 475 area per permit (the core module takes 25 area)


[04-Feb-24 09:14 AM] jvaler#0000
and permits are valuable, you can only get more by upgrading your HQ which gets expensive later game (https://pct.fnar.net/hq/)


[04-Feb-24 09:16 AM] kegoscho#0000
good point, thanks

[04-Feb-24 09:18 AM] jvaler#0000
plus making new bases gives you access to that new planet's COGC so you can diversify and cover more industries. it's better to do food industries on norwick than deimos because norwick has a food industries COGC bonus


[04-Feb-24 11:28 AM] havanista#0000
you have to see, wich planet have technicians for instance with your industry, it's difficult to have those, so i expended Deimos, because i need Techniciens and wpeciality metalurgy...

[06-Feb-24 02:10 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i think so, although i thought i had calc'd it right so that i would produce the exact amount


[06-Feb-24 02:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you have any extra, remove them for more smelters.


[06-Feb-24 02:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'd also advise against collecting O.


[06-Feb-24 02:11 PM] kegoscho#0000
Got a similar setup. But 3 smelter more.
But I think I will deconstruct my O collection today for a few more


[06-Feb-24 02:13 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
and just use the space for more smelter?


[06-Feb-24 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[06-Feb-24 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maximum smelter base makes more profit than any other combination.


[06-Feb-24 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even if you meet all O and ALO means, CX buying maximises it.


[06-Feb-24 02:15 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i need to recalc my production to minimise excess ALO production too


[06-Feb-24 02:15 PM] kaosaur#0000
you should buy your ALO too


[06-Feb-24 02:15 PM] kaosaur#0000
@ 75/unit in LM


[06-Feb-24 02:16 PM] kaosaur#0000
i think that was the price anyway


[06-Feb-24 02:16 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i extract my own on deimos though, ALO is the main resource on deimos


[06-Feb-24 02:16 PM] kaosaur#0000
yeah but resource extraction isn't the CoGC, metallurgy is


[06-Feb-24 02:17 PM] kaosaur#0000
you get the most bonus to smelting


[06-Feb-24 02:17 PM] kaosaur#0000
e.g., go all in on smelting


[06-Feb-24 02:17 PM] kegoscho#0000
Well I know what I will do after work lol


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
yeah i guess you're right, but i also do it because i provide a lot of ALO to my friend for cheaper than that, so i kinda do it for the benefit of us both ig


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] kaosaur#0000
fair fair.  i mean, do what is the most fun for you


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] kaosaur#0000
i'm not even really following my own advice yet either


[06-Feb-24 02:21 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i'm currently sending materials to Nike to set up a base to make bfabs, and i'll just send all the AL i make over there.


[06-Feb-24 02:22 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
and extract the LST on Nike, save me hauling it from CX.


[06-Feb-24 03:52 PM] jvaler#0000
correct


[06-Feb-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
full EXT is still viable given the LM market for it. it's just maximizing experts that's the issue doing EXT and SME at the same time


[06-Feb-24 03:53 PM] kaosaur#0000
aye


[06-Feb-24 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
My first million came from ALO ext on Deimos.


[06-Feb-24 04:33 PM] kaosaur#0000
I still haven't decided if I want to take the grant or not


[06-Feb-24 04:33 PM] kaosaur#0000
so for now I'm just slowplaying it extracting ALO and selling to LM


[06-Feb-24 04:33 PM] kaosaur#0000
i have 3 right now and probably only going to buy SME from now on


[06-Feb-24 04:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’ll buy some of your ALO if you want


[06-Feb-24 04:34 PM] kaosaur#0000
i just sold my first 200


[06-Feb-24 04:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh lol


[06-Feb-24 04:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[10-Feb-24 06:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
The typical method of making money would be creating products at your base and transporting them to the CX to sell for profits, purchasing more materials, inputs, and consumables to transport to your base, and repeating the process.


[10-Feb-24 06:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Trading CX to CX is viable to an extent although it is a bit more difficult than just producing and selling.

[10-Feb-24 09:31 PM] degeneratesupreme#0000
So on the high end of this game, what do numbers of bases look like for the most successful companies/corporations?


[10-Feb-24 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
It really comes down to a limit on permits and their cost.


[10-Feb-24 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
33 bases is the maximum anyone's gotten so far, but 41 permits is the highest anyone has gotten to.


[10-Feb-24 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Top 200 on the leaderboard is 9 bases, top 100 is 14, 50 being 17, and 25 being 22 bases.


[10-Feb-24 09:37 PM] degeneratesupreme#0000

[10-Feb-24 09:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

Up to you - but if it were me, as I've suggested for others, I'd put a check on Phobos and go for Deimos at the start.


[10-Feb-24 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Your grant of 750k with my internal prices pretty much guarantees a full 500 permit base on Deimos doing smelters which nets about 50k a day profit guaranteed.

[11-Feb-24 10:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I remember when I started the price was like 60 and hardly a week later people are selling for 100/u

Who is speculating on the value of shiny rock


[11-Feb-24 10:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well when I started the price people were buying it for was 90-100 and with in a week or so it dropped to 75/u and now its back up at 100/u


[11-Feb-24 10:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And that's just within a month

[12-Feb-24 05:38 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd say no RIG no FP just 13 FRM and import the water. it's not a lot of water so it's not difficult


[12-Feb-24 05:39 AM] jvaler#0000
you wanna maximize the effectiveness of your experts. you can only get the 5 max experts in a single industry


[12-Feb-24 05:39 AM] _katze_kattzen_#0000
FP for Pioneer Vital need doe.


[12-Feb-24 05:39 AM] jvaler#0000
not really no. you can just buy that off the CX too


[12-Feb-24 05:40 AM] jvaler#0000
i haven't run the numbers but i'd assume with 5th expert and COGC taken into account replacing FP with FRM is better money


[12-Feb-24 05:40 AM] _katze_kattzen_#0000
for now thats highly unlikely + planning to have the money for pro next month anyway so.


[12-Feb-24 05:40 AM] jvaler#0000
especially if you farm and sell HER, those are in hot demand rn

It tells you how often a ship needs to visit your planet in order to get materials you need to ship out (export) or get in (import).


[12-Feb-24 05:47 AM] scorpio089#0000
with your starter ship that has 500 volume and 500 ton capacity, you need to get stuff away from your planet every 16 days, and import every 606 days.


[12-Feb-24 05:47 AM] jvaler#0000
keep all your current buildings and use the money you get to build more FRMs. your goal should be 13 FRMs, but in the meantime FP are probably better profit before you can minmax


[12-Feb-24 05:47 AM] scorpio089#0000
import is irrelevant, as you're self sufficient.


[12-Feb-24 05:48 AM] wolftomoe#0000
wait I go for selling once two years IRL? xD


[12-Feb-24 05:48 AM] _katze_kattzen_#0000
😭 606 days i be playing for almost 2 years to gain that juicy profit-


[12-Feb-24 05:48 AM] scorpio089#0000
Buying, not selling.


[12-Feb-24 05:48 AM] scorpio089#0000
Selling = exporting stuff.


[12-Feb-24 05:48 AM] scorpio089#0000
And you can go whenever you want; only after 16 days the storage you have with your current base will be full and production will stop due to missing storage capacity.


[12-Feb-24 05:50 AM] wolftomoe#0000
but I have 2 ships so after 32 days I keep on producing same stuff my storage will be full? storage includes base storage + cargo of 2 ships?


[12-Feb-24 05:50 AM] scorpio089#0000
Only base. Not your ships.


[12-Feb-24 05:50 AM] wolftomoe#0000
i see


[12-Feb-24 05:50 AM] scorpio089#0000

[12-Feb-24 05:51 AM] scorpio089#0000
Your promitor base is quite self sufficient, so those numbers don't matter that much. Have a look at an example on Vulcan that is handling materials much heavier. Such a plan is only possible with quite some logistics or things traded locally.

no no corp yet. is it wise to make a corp or join?


[12-Feb-24 05:52 AM] scorpio089#0000
If you find one with a Corporation HQ on Promitor why not, otherwise not really


[12-Feb-24 05:53 AM] scorpio089#0000
If you create one, you would still need to build that Headquarter on Promitor and that comes with quite the hefty price tag.

2.5 maybe, not sure


[12-Feb-24 05:56 AM] wolftomoe#0000
is there a difference in joining and having one on own?


[12-Feb-24 05:56 AM] wolftomoe#0000
like is there a maintainace cost thing or tax


[12-Feb-24 05:57 AM] scorpio089#0000
Not really; but taxes that governors collect are split between all corporation members. thats why many players who are governors have a corporation just for themselves


[12-Feb-24 05:58 AM] wolftomoe#0000
thats fucked up, why elect someone who runs solo


[12-Feb-24 05:58 AM] scorpio089#0000
Why not? Governorships are nearly never profitable. It's more a way for older players to give back; I think I never turned any profit by governing Vulcan.


[12-Feb-24 05:59 AM] wolftomoe#0000
im not sure of this governing thing


[12-Feb-24 05:59 AM] wolftomoe#0000
I was just thinking of geting pro once create own corp so that I can still own corp without getting pro


[12-Feb-24 05:59 AM] wolftomoe#0000
other than that I cant find whats the benefit of joining corp or owning one


[12-Feb-24 06:00 AM] scorpio089#0000
biggest advantage of Pro is not the Corporation; its flying more ships and using contracts / local market.


[12-Feb-24 06:00 AM] wolftomoe#0000
second biggest advantage of pro* Im looking for as f2p, one being getting the basic other being owning a corp


[12-Feb-24 06:02 AM] scorpio089#0000
Owning a corp can be an advantage if there is a HQ, otherwise I would not know a reason for corps being advantageous.


[12-Feb-24 06:03 AM] wolftomoe#0000
yea so make corp > make HQ at current base I see


[12-Feb-24 06:04 AM] scorpio089#0000
just think ahead, your HQ is only on one planet. While your plan should be to have multiple planets with a 500 area base each, all connecting into your overall supply chain. So the Corp HQ Bonus is great, but it will only affect a part of your overall supply chain.


[12-Feb-24 06:05 AM] wolftomoe#0000
so have hq in such a way that final output is max right?


[12-Feb-24 06:05 AM] wolftomoe#0000
like we have bases at A, B, C. C being final we have HQ at C?


[12-Feb-24 06:06 AM] wolftomoe#0000
also if someone builds HQ at A let's say, can they demolish it and make HQ at C later?


[12-Feb-24 06:08 AM] _katze_kattzen_#0000
Is ADI a corp or just a project?


[12-Feb-24 06:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Note: you can't build corp HQs on [most] starter planets


[12-Feb-24 06:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yes...


[12-Feb-24 06:15 AM] wolftomoe#0000
ouuu but can we remove one if built and make again in diff?


[12-Feb-24 06:17 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That I don't know... corp HQs are expensive though


[12-Feb-24 06:19 AM] scorpio089#0000
but you will never be able to build one on Promitor, as CptColeslaw said - it's a starter planet.


[12-Feb-24 06:25 AM] wolftomoe#0000
Is expertise unlocked random? It unlocked with passage of days is it

😅 sorry I meant to elaborate and got distracted. It's run like a corp, but is basically just a big collaborative project. it doesn't require any serious commitment or prevent you from joining another corp, but if you want to treat it as a full time corp you absolutely can. We've got some lower internal prices, big group projects, and all that fun stuff that you'll often find in other corps ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so... "yes" 😅

I have a ship heading back out there in 27 hours if you need hauling from ANT


[12-Feb-24 09:06 AM] wolftomoe#0000
hi guys,
I'm trying to run maths to max out Promitor base to make it either FP or FRM based on all the suggestions, I have few questions.

1) can I run PrUn to run two simulations on 13 FRM and 13 FP to see how much gain it would be. Considering if its FP I will procure GRN VEG BEA and if its FRM I will procure water

basic numbers are 1600 ICA from 1 FRM and 3800 from 1 FP (not considering the the procurement cost H20 or veggies)

2) Is Argiculture bonus that significant that people recommend FRM over FP?

3) I want to understand loan process OR a way to procure cheap MATS to set this base up ASAP as people told we can talk things out on this :}

Anything other tips are always welcome

[12-Feb-24 09:12 AM] jvaler#0000
1: not sure what you mean by "run PrUn to run two simulations", but PrunPlanner (https://prunplanner.org/) can let you create 2 different plans for both scenarios to compare them.

2: absolutely. if you want FP you build a base on avalon for it's food industries CoGC

3: this group specifically only gives out grants to antares-based people. if you're looking for a general loan lowstrife would be the most likely person to go to. (https://discord.com/channels/350171287785701388/350171288267915277/1172662993104941106)

[12-Feb-24 09:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
The ag bonus is pretty significant and FRMs are probably better. But PRUNplanner has a feature specifically for this. You could build both bases in that and compare


[12-Feb-24 09:15 AM] wolftomoe#0000
1) yes what values to check in PrUn is Im looking for, I created to empire but what data to look for is lil scary.

2) avalon is something else right? Im in promitor 😦

3) sure would check that channel


[12-Feb-24 09:15 AM] wolftomoe#0000
I built separately how do I compare?


[12-Feb-24 09:16 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'd definitely also recommend supplying you workers with COF and PWO


[12-Feb-24 09:18 AM] jvaler#0000
1: just make sure your CX settings are how you want them and all variables in the plan itself are accounted for, like setting the CoGC, enabling luxury consumables, and setting 5 agri experts

2: yes, avalon is another planet in the same system as promitor. the idea is you max out FRMs on promitor and then ship the output to FP on avalon. you don't want to do FRM+FP on promitor because those FP won't be able to get the powerful bonus from the 5th expert on top of not aligning with the CoGC program.

3: that's a link to a specific message, not just the channel


[12-Feb-24 09:20 AM] wolftomoe#0000
so the plan is to setup next base in Avalon to use the resource as input for FP? interesting


[12-Feb-24 09:20 AM] wolftomoe#0000
I was going to chain it with what will be the next step.

I really have to sit and read this experts one, Im still missing it


[12-Feb-24 09:22 AM] jvaler#0000
cause you can only get 5 experts in 1 industry type per base. FRMs being agriculture type and FP being food industries type makes one or the other miss out on it

[14-Feb-24 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
What do you want to do within ANT? Unfortunately Deimos is fully spaced out so that's not an option without coliq, and Deimos is a really solid planet, but there are some other options.


[14-Feb-24 01:17 PM] nembrot#0000
@Deleted User I would find some planet in ANT region and expand there, any suggestions on what might be useful for the region are welcome, preferably in the direction of Promitor


[14-Feb-24 01:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
There's quite some distance between Promitor and ANT.

Your most developed planets are within the cluster around the commodity exchange.


[14-Feb-24 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Phobos, Heph, Nike, Vulcan, Harmonia come to mind.


[14-Feb-24 01:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those are all great planets. If you are farming on Prom, you can also do food production on Norwick or carbon incineration on Nascent


[14-Feb-24 01:29 PM] chobbycock#0000
Are the grants still available? I've just set up a second base, however I have majorly miscalculated the costs of it and could use a bit of help 😅


[14-Feb-24 01:31 PM] nembrot#0000
@Deleted User the general idea is to build a base somewhere in ANT with the grant money and move the HQ there, looking for nice locations right now.


[14-Feb-24 01:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
They are.


[14-Feb-24 01:37 PM] chobbycock#0000

Yeah, it is pretty simple haha.

@Deleted User and how about me, also simple, or it's one of those rare cases ;]


[14-Feb-24 01:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can send you the contract now but keep in mind it'll be in AIC so of little value at Promitor.


[14-Feb-24 01:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although it'd be useful for when you get a ship to ANT.


[14-Feb-24 01:46 PM] nembrot#0000

Ok so why PP2 over PP1 other than PP2 uses Al and PP1 uses Fe?


[22-Feb-24 04:55 PM] jvaler#0000
it makes things faster, has more options, and like you said uses AL instead of FE which means you save money. At least, you save money in antares where AL is cheaper than FE


[22-Feb-24 04:56 PM] jvaler#0000
and AL/ALO is way lighter than FE/FEO

don't think so, they just decided to split their posts. combined it looks like normal volume to me, though it's kinda hard to check the pulse of symbiotic LM relationships between bases cause there's no public transaction history like there is with CXPC

How much value is there in Einsteinium, I know it's used for the Gin, but what else?


[25-Feb-24 01:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
ES isn't massively profitable, I don't think


[25-Feb-24 01:31 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Neurostimulants use ES but that isn't traded much on CX either


[25-Feb-24 01:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But making GIN and alcohol in general is a pretty sweet business in terms of profit/day/area

[25-Feb-24 01:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Not sure, but my guess is Einsteinium is better to buy if you are making GIN


[25-Feb-24 01:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

start making your own DDT?


[26-Feb-24 09:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
How much DDT do you use per day? I'll trade you some.


[26-Feb-24 09:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
What do you make,  just HER?


[26-Feb-24 09:26 PM] _katze_kattzen_#0000

gotta gain back those capitals.


[26-Feb-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
after you sell off your HER, perhaps it's time to diversify? Carbon has been spiking, and a few INC on Nascent will create a steady income


[26-Feb-24 09:30 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
How much DDT do you need right now?


[26-Feb-24 09:32 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
@_katze_kattzen_ if you post the highest ASK at ANT right now I'll fill it,  up to 40 DDT

maybe you can pivot to GIN @_katze_kattzen_ , grain is low cost to grow and the only difference is buying Einsteinium from the exchange


[28-Feb-24 05:09 PM] _katze_kattzen_#0000

FRM?*


[28-Feb-24 05:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
GRN is from FRMs, the HOPs are from an ORC


[28-Feb-24 05:27 PM] okamicheems1#0000
Yes but a base dedicated to fermentation would increase revenue without having to significantly change your agriculture base


[28-Feb-24 05:28 PM] okamicheems1#0000
And it would give built in flexibility

what's even going on with the prices, is someone buying it all up or is there just a universal shortage?


[29-Feb-24 10:40 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Didn't chonk just buy up most of ANT for a new HER/KOM operation? That doesn't explain the Putney CXs though. Maybe this is a delayed spike from the huge KOM shortage that drove a lot of people into that industry? If some of them were buying the DDT on CX and reserves are finally low... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

will get back to you on that, my liquidity is a bit iffy right now. a lot of capital is going into making REP and it's not selling that fast

now if u calculate the dw  rat consuption of the pionners to  make alo, the fuel cost to transport it to ant, it's realy not worth it selling it like that, you have to transform it ! , unless u go to Benton or Moria to sell it !

There's a semi decent balance one between producing ALO and O on Deimos and only importing C, but the overall profits are about 10/20k lower than full smelters on a 500 base.


[03-Mar-24 03:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
However it does result in less shipping and less management.


[03-Mar-24 03:17 PM] havanista#0000
depends what u smelt, titanium gives more return than al for instance


[03-Mar-24 03:22 PM] tanda#0000

and i just make my own C on Harmonia, but then again i don't have a need to smelt to sell, as i use my AL to make bfabs

[07-Mar-24 08:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Btw, from my analysis, AML (Advanced Material Lab) is the absolute most profitable building in Antares by a significant margin. Only issue is the input materials you'd be buying are 1/2 of weekly trade if you don't supply yourself


[07-Mar-24 08:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

What is the average cost of a new ship? Just a rough ballpark price


[11-Mar-24 05:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like a new WCB or a new starter ship?


[11-Mar-24 05:39 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I’m finding it difficult running my operation with only 2

Like a new starter?


[11-Mar-24 05:40 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Although I would probably want to have a larger storage for my next one


[11-Mar-24 05:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can upgrade an existing ship to a larger storage


[11-Mar-24 05:40 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah, I still think I need a 3rd ship though

Upgrading from starter to WCB with better fuel tanks is about 650k if you use deals.

Lmao I thought so. What would you change?


[11-Mar-24 05:54 PM] spekktra_#0000
In some point, u will become short on Carbon (let's check se-110 system). And about H, im using QJ-382g, it's much richer fot H and there is AMN, but it's long trip, u will need 1000m3 or 3000m3 ship 🙂


[11-Mar-24 06:00 PM] spekktra_#0000
Se-110 is a expensive system (4 bases) but it will give u stupidly amount of C, DW, RAT, only thing what u need there is NS 🙂


[11-Mar-24 06:44 PM] sidepipe#0000

[11-Mar-24 06:51 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah distance was the reason I tried to stay close to my other bases, even if it meant sacrificing product yield


[11-Mar-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
ZV-759g for H is a bit odd. most people use KI-401d for H


[11-Mar-24 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000

[11-Mar-24 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
it is pretty logi heavy. personally i wouldn't bother with it in your position until you get more capital, it isn't worth it when the CX price for H is great


[11-Mar-24 06:57 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah I guess you’re right, I’ll probably just mash out PG and BDE to sell for a while until I decide if I want to build PP3 and go more advanced


[11-Mar-24 06:57 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I thought about smelting my own glass and making LTA and stuff but meh not sure


[11-Mar-24 06:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
if you decide to get into glass let me know - I've got a bunch from making CL to give away. it feels silly to sell it to the MM for 15 credits

I have 24 CHP making just CL on a planet with very little traffic. I literally can't *give* it away on the LM. I've posted huge shipping ads just to move it so I don't run out of space for production cause I don't visit there often. I buy the HAL and sell the CL on the same planet, so if it wasn't for all this damn NA I'd only have to visit that place every 3 months...


[11-Mar-24 07:20 PM] spekktra_#0000

nobody would complain if the NA was the money maker, the shipping isn't *that* bad, it just feels bad when you're shipping time is spend hauling one of the most worthless items in the game, lol


[11-Mar-24 07:50 PM] spekktra_#0000
What about Glass and THF, is it worth it for mass production form NA?


[11-Mar-24 07:50 PM] spekktra_#0000
THF must be worth it, bcs of INS, im buying tons of THF


[11-Mar-24 07:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
THF is good money, GL can be alright money too, but they'll never be worth as much as the same area put into just making more CL... going out of your way to use the NA isn't worth it


[11-Mar-24 08:42 PM] jvaler#0000
NA being low value necessarily makes it's cost as an input also entirely neglible


[11-Mar-24 08:43 PM] jvaler#0000
so it wouldn't hurt you to repurpose NA from CL prod, but it's also no better than just buying it at 25.1/u on the CX

[13-Mar-24 03:43 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
looking to future plan for bases


[13-Mar-24 04:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I make H2O on Etherwind and Ice Station alpha
DW/RAT on SE-110a and Norwick.
I grow crops on SE-110b (hyf base, which is expensive), Harmonia, and Demeter.


[13-Mar-24 04:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
(and I make carbon on SE-110d and Nascent)


[13-Mar-24 04:16 PM] jvaler#0000
life is also an option for HYF, but i just looked and it's HSE as opposed to INS+SEA on SE-110b. HYF are a small area building like RIGs so HSE kinda hurts there. not sure how the numbers add up though considering it's a single red condition on life compared to 2 red conditions on SE-110b

[13-Mar-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, we just added a shipyard to SE-110, so you can take your water from ISA to SE-110b in-system, which is a plus


[13-Mar-24 04:21 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
because i make grow HCP and burn it on Harmonia to make Carbon but i feel like this isn't optimal


[13-Mar-24 04:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Naaahhh. Once you’ve got a few bases it’s best to match the cogc.

[18-Mar-24 10:17 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Most of my bases like my H and SIO extraction are just 500, just mainly for my bigger operations like smelting and BFABs are more permits 750/1000

not entirely sure... i asusme they're similar to AA but not antares based


[19-Mar-24 12:21 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
They got 82 people and second place has 30


[19-Mar-24 12:21 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
They gotta be doing something right


[19-Mar-24 12:22 AM] jvaler#0000
how are you counting that?


[19-Mar-24 12:23 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
FIO. There is no endpoint for all users but I went through all sites on starter planets, got all users, then got what corp they are at


[19-Mar-24 12:24 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Not sure how many users are missing but I want to sleep and not count the number of people in corps


[19-Mar-24 12:24 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll finish later


[19-Mar-24 12:24 AM] jvaler#0000
oh so ingame corp membership?


[19-Mar-24 12:26 AM] jvaler#0000
i don't think most corps just invite every member to an ingame corp because that would distribute all the taxes collected by any governor in the corp.

the ones that do do that are outliers from what i've seen


[19-Mar-24 12:26 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I saw that KAWA has like 12 alternate corps with 1 person


[19-Mar-24 12:27 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
But I don't have a nicer way of counting up the members and the corps should still have a main body corp. So I think it's good enough for size comparison


[19-Mar-24 12:29 AM] jvaler#0000
maybe i'm being too loose in my conception of a "corp" cause AA is pretty loosely organized itself. most planet upkeep operations are done by a single person and a handful of proxy governors lol

I want to know what people tend to buy from CX over in-corp


[19-Mar-24 01:03 AM] spekktra_#0000
U are mining interesting data 🙂


[19-Mar-24 07:27 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
GTU does ship building, that's all I know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ they don't really seem to have any recruiting guidelines, just "you found our server? You're in! ". Not saying that's bad, just that it might be part of large in game membership.


[19-Mar-24 07:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
And yeah,  all those KAWA single member corps are KAWA members governing planets like jvaler said


[19-Mar-24 07:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That's cool data though, I'm interested to see what you find regarding production


[22-Mar-24 03:04 PM] shagie#0000
A key thing with GTU is that there are efforts that can give people within the corp a goal or meaning.  "We want to be part of ship building" - "ok, here's how you fit in" or "we're growing a planet in {place} - come here, build, trade, build in a nearby place and trade" -- it gives a thing to do / strive for in what otherwise is a rather freeform game.  For some people, having (or directing) such a goal is an important part of continued game engagement. ... though be ware the flip side of it becoming a job/chore and burnout if you feel you _must_ do something.


[22-Mar-24 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000

It's how I burnt out the gatcha I played before "everyone get their points for the weekly clan vs clan battle" and why EVE except as a solo "pew pew ships in PVE" is in the "not fun" category.  If a game becomes a job it is _far_ to easy for it to be not fun at some point.


[22-Mar-24 03:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeeeeah, real life got real stressful for me lately so I've been fighting this in PrUn. I dropped a ton of expansion plans and rebuilt a few bases to be simpler, then just funded new players to fill some stuff I used to make. Still hoping to demo 2 bases soon to prioritize other stuff because I think the social role I play in KAWA leadership is honestly more fun/enjoyable to me than the game itself at this point


[22-Mar-24 03:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Just wish I had more tech skills to develop tools for them


[22-Mar-24 03:29 PM] talryk#0000
Honestly, a game like PrUn really benefits from players like yourself, who take more to the social connections between players


[22-Mar-24 03:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
It's honestly the first purely online friend group I've ever had. This community really is just great and the wave of new players the last few months has been fun. It's presented a lot of challenges of organization for a corp like KAWA and I think that part is pretty fun. I honestly think it's the type of game I'd still be "playing" for years in discord and spreadsheets even if I deleted my account tomorrow. So much of it is just about the community


[22-Mar-24 03:39 PM] talryk#0000
On that note, I’d been eyeing the recruitment poster for your corp. I really think that joining a broad corp would help me to enjoy the game, but I want to avoid being pigeonholed too hard into just in-corp, clique-style of play. Would that still fly well in Kawa?


[22-Mar-24 03:46 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA does operate on a pretty isolated internal market. There are a lot of benefits to it, and a lot of freedom to do what you want, just depends on what you mean by 'pigeonholed' ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ we don't have big fully integrated 0-cost projects like AA or some other corps, but we always sell our products to corp members before selling to the general market. That's it though. Within that there's tons of flexibility, but if that feels limiting to you then it might not be the right fit. I love it though, obviously. I like the focus on growing a smaller group within the game but with the freedom to build whatever I want


[22-Mar-24 04:03 PM] talryk#0000
Well I think I can live with that! I’ll hop on over to the corp discord and give a wave.


[22-Mar-24 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I wasn't already occupied KAWA would definitely be a decent fit for myself.


[22-Mar-24 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although at the end of the day that internal market is a bit too restricting for me to really care for.


[22-Mar-24 05:28 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
It can be. That said, KAWA's internal marked doesn't prevent AA project membership. I'm in dnpc, I actually think the 2 groups synergize pretty well since they don't ask for any conflicting commitments from members ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[22-Mar-24 05:31 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you're a KAWA trade partner though, and that will definitely benefit you once we can sort our new player explosion out a bit 😅 consumables and fabs production are struggling to keep up with internal needs. but at this point you've already given more than enough to justify buying at our prices as a full trade partner. (you're gonna love this 195/u KOM)


[22-Mar-24 05:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That’s a juicy price


[22-Mar-24 05:34 PM] jvaler#0000

HMS at 370 is the biggest difference from CX in terms of percentage for any material... most prices are closer to 1/3-1/2 of cx though


[22-Mar-24 05:55 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
It's also the reason I can't really afford to just like, buy KOM on the CX if KAWA runs out though...

What's the internal price for the other fermenter goods? Just curious as an outsider lol


[22-Mar-24 06:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
GIN 490, WIN 2450, ALE 320


[22-Mar-24 06:20 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
basically, they're all calculated based on ROI. We chose a price for one material (DW @ 25/u), and calculated everything else out so that basically any building/base pays for itself in about 20d. This led to a pricing structure that is actually *really* close to CX for most items, ours just don't fluctuate based on demand, so you can see where certain items that have low supply for demand become a really good deal for us, like lots of high tier consumables and ship parts, while there are actually some materials with super low demand and high supply that are even cheaper on CX than they are for us (MAG, I, GAL, AR, TS, FEO)

😆 I'm not too worried. KAWA has a pretty long governing history and runs some big planets with pretty low taxes and happy citizens so far as I can tell. Look at the population vs the taxes on Proxion compared to other planets that size. Governing is honestly where our internal pricing has some of the biggest benefits I think. Who doesn't like cheap taxes for cheap upkeep

[24-Mar-24 09:29 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Not really no. I lose some flexibility, but as far as KAWA is concerned I basically just treat my Deomos base like a magic resource extraction base that pulls bfabs from thin air 😆 I buy the consumables for that base from KAWA and sell the bfabs to KAWA all at our internal prices. It actually makes that base *extra* profitable since AA calculates shares based in CX prices ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[24-Mar-24 09:30 PM] jvaler#0000
hmmmmmm


[24-Mar-24 09:31 PM] jvaler#0000
ah wait i've got private trades with some people in AA that use internal prices there


[24-Mar-24 09:31 PM] jvaler#0000
*that* would probably conflict


[24-Mar-24 09:32 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ same. we try to trade internally first, filling corp needs before trading externally, but we wouldn't ask anyone to abandon existing arrangements, especially if you're making the materials yourself


[24-Mar-24 09:32 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I trade with AA and Evil a lot for things we don't make in KAWA and sell to them in exchange


[24-Mar-24 09:33 PM] jvaler#0000
it is all self produced stuff... but wouldn't the deflated currency i get give me an advantage compared to other corp members?


[24-Mar-24 09:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it would yeah, but I'm sure there's some math that could fix that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ buying some of the upkeep and repair for those bases on CX would be enough. Really, the only taboo is if you're buying things from corp then selling those things or their products to others without offering to corp first


[24-Mar-24 09:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
so that's pretty easy to work around


[24-Mar-24 09:36 PM] jvaler#0000

[25-Mar-24 06:03 PM] jvaler#0000

MG is very easy to ship, why make it on-site with your POL?


[25-Mar-24 06:05 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
it was to mainly make the most of the planets resources and reduce my shipping/price costs


[25-Mar-24 06:06 PM] jvaler#0000
well it's about as easy (if not easier because of the leaning towards mass which favors WCBs) to ship as H2O

oh really? okay that's not nearly as bad as i thought

forgor your experts


[25-Mar-24 06:08 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
yeah, i'll add them in as i gain them.


[25-Mar-24 06:09 PM] jvaler#0000
oh it's just generally good practice to assume 5 experts cause that's where all bases end up. but that has uses too


[25-Mar-24 06:10 PM] jvaler#0000
looks good, i like it


[25-Mar-24 06:10 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
ahh, i've stuck 5 in chemistry and the PG output per day is now 4585, lol.

although, i could scale the base down and built it up piece by piece as i slowly start to make PG and make my own BDE and sell it tho.

[25-Mar-24 06:15 PM] jvaler#0000
i've been meaning to stick a PPF on my WPL base but i haven't sent a ship out that way yet


[25-Mar-24 06:15 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
lmao, when in finally get the PG and Manu base running ima undercut the shit out of the market lol


[25-Mar-24 06:20 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I think my current focus is still saving up for ship storage upgrades tho, i can't keep running with only 500.


[25-Mar-24 06:20 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
The amount of runs i need to do to shift AL and FE is insane.


[25-Mar-24 06:21 PM] spekktra_#0000
Cheapest upgrade is make a ship  3000/1000 🙂


[25-Mar-24 06:21 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
what storage is that?


[25-Mar-24 06:22 PM] jvaler#0000
WCB


[25-Mar-24 06:23 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
is it worth also upgrade fuel tanks and engines whilst i'm at the upgrades?


[25-Mar-24 06:23 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
or just do storage first?


[25-Mar-24 06:23 PM] spekktra_#0000
In my opinion,  only if u are flying more then 3 jumps at once.

[25-Mar-24 06:25 PM] jvaler#0000
because a lot of ship internals (cockpit and ftl emitters, etc.)are based on the ship's volume, the jump from 500m^3 to 1000m^3 as opposed to 2000m^3 allows the ship to reuse a lot more of it's internals instead of having to void them and procure new ones.

reusing old parts is also why you shouldn't upgrade engines on starters. the basic ones work just fine and replacing them is wasteful.

for tanks the large FTL tank actually takes up very little volume so it doesn't increast cost much at all. the STL tank is a different story and only a medium STL tank is reccomended


[25-Mar-24 06:26 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
My HQ base is the middle, so i'm central so i'll only ever do 2 jumps max so it works out really well.


[25-Mar-24 06:26 PM] spekktra_#0000
U don't need to upgrade fuel tank 🙂


[25-Mar-24 06:26 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
so just save up and do WCB, gotcha


[25-Mar-24 06:26 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
thanks man 🙂


[25-Mar-24 06:32 PM] jvaler#0000
isn't it better to now so you don't waste emitters doing it later?


[25-Mar-24 06:32 PM] jvaler#0000
or does that not happen


[25-Mar-24 06:32 PM] spekktra_#0000
That's a good question actually,  sadly I don't have a answer 😕


[25-Mar-24 06:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yesterday I said on the main server that the basic commodities are too profitable and how that slows down people trickling into other mats. I graphed how much new players making basics can get and I wanted to ask if I should show it. I don't think it's very fun to be told exactly which material is the absolute most profitable, which is why I haven't shown a full graph, but I want people to know about these, make more of them, and drive the price down. Helps new players get through the slog faster too


[25-Mar-24 06:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Here is an example of the bottom 10. I might remove some if it's unlikely a new player would make these

Like idk if CI1 has a good AL planet nearby


[26-Mar-24 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
This mostly comes from a lack of players.


[26-Mar-24 12:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
If we had a good few multiples higher in population, basics would be overwhelmed and people would be forced to go upwards for profit.


[26-Mar-24 12:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
It'd make everything cheaper and so we'd have a massive expansion into higher tier goods.

{Reactions}
👌 

[26-Mar-24 12:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
Probably even higher amounts of planet building with new cogcs as well.


[26-Mar-24 12:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Triple red plants would also probably be more viable and less frowned upon as well, too.


[26-Mar-24 12:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Debatable whether or not that'd really end up making a difference since yes everything would be cheaper but I imagine everything would also be a lot less profitable, so it'd probably even itself out.


[26-Mar-24 12:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just less scarcity on the CX and probably less market distribution when a larger player quits.


[26-Mar-24 03:12 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I can't control how many players pick up the game, but telling them more accurate info on which is most profitable should increase player retention and push more people into higher tier stuff, making their production feasible outside of a corp


[26-Mar-24 03:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
For example I heard a lot of people dogging on fuel engineer and manufacturing start, but they are pretty up there according to what I found


[26-Mar-24 03:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Definitely better than AL.AI1 :(((((


[26-Mar-24 03:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Antares number one yet again (from the bottom)


[26-Mar-24 03:14 PM] jvaler#0000
manufacturing's great, i don't think people have said it's bad profit wise but that they're worried it will confuse new players. not that i agree but


[26-Mar-24 03:15 PM] talryk#0000
I think the people dogging on the fuel engineer start is just a matter of the profit margins being smaller per unit, and it’s easy to disregard the volume you’d wind up moving; *everyone* needs fuel


[26-Mar-24 03:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the early game can be boring and added gameplay from picking what to produce and what to get from CX is worth it


[26-Mar-24 03:15 PM] jvaler#0000
REAL


[26-Mar-24 03:16 PM] jvaler#0000
imo the people who would get confused by the recipes would be confused by the game anyways, but players who just get it get more options to engage with


[26-Mar-24 03:18 PM] talryk#0000
While I do agree with you in principle, that’s not an outwardly attractive marketing model. People who like this form of complexity don’t often go out specifically looking for it as such, and games advertising themselves as such would be far less likely to catch prospective newbies’ attention


[26-Mar-24 03:19 PM] jvaler#0000

[26-Mar-24 08:42 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Most people I think try to stock between a week and a month depending on how big and unmanageable their empire is. Some people are doomsday preppers apparently and start getting worried when they're below 40-50d (😅me)

I'm actually thinking about 6 weeks atm, but might save the money for ship upgrades instead


[26-Mar-24 09:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
total, I keep about 60d for my whole operation. I stock my bases up to at least 40 when I resupply, and I have enough stockpile on Etherwind that I could restock *everything* for 20-30d, so if KAWA lost a supplier for anything I could go over 2 months without needing it while we re-establish supply ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I have to think about these things more though because of my corp, I can't really afford to supply any consumables from CX, so I try to keep as much evergency supply as I can afford


[27-Mar-24 05:57 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Is this how i would go about upgrading a starter ship to my new upgraded one?

🤩


[28-Mar-24 07:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I usually recommend upgrading to MFL and LHP too. More FF capacity means longer trips without getting stranded. LHP is just cheaper long term


[28-Mar-24 07:50 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Do you do upgrades all at once? Or piecemeal?


[28-Mar-24 07:50 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
After that it's worth getting QCR and FSE on new ships. But don't bother upgrading them on existing ships.


[28-Mar-24 07:51 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
up to you honestly, all at once is nice but it doesn't really matter that much I don't think, other than the downtime for the upgrading


[28-Mar-24 07:52 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
As an endgame goal I think it would be funny to fully pimp out one of my ships


[28-Mar-24 07:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I eventually want a tiny ship with 250/250 or 500/500 capacity and all thing things for just going insanely fast. Consume a normal weeks worth of fuel and fly BEN to ANT in under an hour cause why not


[28-Mar-24 07:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[28-Mar-24 08:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah I don't think you need to go that small, I don't even know what you'd ship with that lol. At minimum I need to be able to ship all the CoGC upkeep for a large planet in one cargo hold, but I think most people would be using it for emergency consumables resupply, and what is 100t/m gonna hold...

I assume they just use the ships for no-area storage


[28-Mar-24 08:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
sometimes, but some of these people also run huge companies. Carcissia was using those 23 ships to run 31 bases. Lots of them high load/volume resource extraction. Xensored is now mainly operating out in Arclight so there's a lot of shipping to and from there that takes a long time.

You can never have too many long-term goals in a game like this 😄

[29-Mar-24 08:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
Plus, it’s fun later to think back at how small your first goals were. I remember celebrating making my first 60 RATs


[29-Mar-24 08:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not that my company is huge now either, but I definitely make 60 rations every now and then


[29-Mar-24 08:24 PM] talryk#0000
Basically! xD
I was basically able to stand up my small Harmonia base thanks to Australis’ grant. If it weren’t for that, I’d still be stuck on Deimos looking at the stars


[29-Mar-24 08:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
😅 just wait till you reach the point of "oh shit... this is a lot... I should slow down", then all your plans change to focusing your efforts instead of just expanding. Still so much planning though, always more planning. never enough spreadsheets


[30-Mar-24 03:45 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah I was the same, I built my full Nike base with my grant, made that money go far.


[30-Mar-24 10:09 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
@coolfeather2 how is the base building going? you getting on alright?

wow, I don't use CX much so I hadn't even noticed... that price is crazy


[31-Mar-24 06:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I was just about to dismantle my COL on Deimos too….


[31-Mar-24 06:42 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm producing so much excess O now... I used to make STL now I'm not using O at all but still have all the COL to feed STL production... just let me know if you need any. It's mostly on Etherwind, but I can move some

[03-Apr-24 05:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I was going to say that contract insurance could be a cool thing to offer as ADI. Since we work a lot with newer players, helping them work together and start their own synergies in the area. A risk of that is that if one of said new players bounces off the game it could leave another new player a little screwed. I'd personally help to reimburse anyone with an account under 180d of any materials or money lost to breached contracts with other new players ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

We are going to be doing that, yes.

I decided to make my own Technetium for HSE because they sell pretty well and found out TCO is ~10t 💀. FEO is ~6t


[08-Apr-24 11:47 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You don't need much so it doesn't matter

I'm buying from CX and to get enough TCS for myself I only need to use 4.5 TCO daily


[09-Apr-24 12:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The RAT for the base costs more


[09-Apr-24 12:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'd buy TCS from the CX too if there was anybody selling it for a reasonable price


[09-Apr-24 01:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I got screwed because there isn't enough Technicians for some reason on Elon despite the pop report

was that before or after POPR?

huh you sure? there should be enough tecs


[09-Apr-24 01:07 PM] flor2081#0000
you need to make sure to build the buildings before the popr happens


[09-Apr-24 01:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well last POPR was April 6 and I built them yesterday


[09-Apr-24 01:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have enough capacity


[09-Apr-24 01:07 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah so you only get them at the popr


[09-Apr-24 01:08 PM] flor2081#0000
that's when most of the unemployment pool is distributed


[09-Apr-24 01:08 PM] flor2081#0000
so you need to build it before the popr


[09-Apr-24 01:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
You get 10% of open jobs reserved to you.


[09-Apr-24 01:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Figures match up when you consider Elon has 3900 unemployed Tecs.


[09-Apr-24 01:09 PM] flor2081#0000
unemployment yeah


[09-Apr-24 01:09 PM] jvaler#0000
oh well yeah, you can only get 10% of a planet's unemployed workforce between POPRs and you get the full amount once POPR hits.
that's what the number in parenthesis is in the construction menu. it's how much reserve workforce is avaliable

Rn only plan on making enough for my own HSE but might start selling on CX too. HSE selling like hot cakes and others might get in on it too with some TCS supply

[13-Apr-24 01:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you can usually get FLX from the LM at 180/u


[13-Apr-24 01:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
From what I've gotten with my code. I'd say the tier list goes like this (in general):
1. Manufacturing 
2. Victualler
3. Fuel Engineer, Construction (Hard to say which one's better, I think fuel is slightly better)
4. AL metallurgist
5. FE metallurgist


[13-Apr-24 01:37 PM] jvaler#0000
victualler > construction? really?


[13-Apr-24 01:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I might need to update the graph but that's what I've gotten from it.

[13-Apr-24 01:58 PM] jvaler#0000
the agri markets are relatively thin compared to their global consumption because most people who make agri consume it themselves to make more profitable products. so relatively little pressure is needed to totally disrupt their markets


[13-Apr-24 02:00 PM] jvaler#0000
the same probably would've happened to ANT if there weren't expensive orders up blocking it from happening

[13-Apr-24 02:01 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean it kinda did happen, the CXOB just happens to not be bone dry. if someone buys 98 GRN it'll be up to 500/u just like in CXPC GRN.CI1


[13-Apr-24 02:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll run it again. I haven't figured out how to make it fancier than assuming it buys everything from CX and that it only has one building. So when you see the numbers for C, it's thinking of 33 INC on a base only using HB 1-5


[13-Apr-24 02:03 PM] jvaler#0000
that assumption honestly sounds fine


[13-Apr-24 02:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd be interested to see how much the profitability for DW.AI1 has changed since then. It seems like supply is starting to catch up to demand

I do like the metric of profit / day / area a lot. Caveats aside, it's a really intuitive way of exploring what to make next


[13-Apr-24 02:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It's down to 138 from 177. I'll post a pic but I think I caught a bug


[13-Apr-24 02:09 PM] sidepipe#0000

[13-Apr-24 02:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think it's better now ? The bug was that it wasn't checking whether the supply was available or not. Available defined as having 2 or more sell orders

Antares #1 (from the bottom)

BBH is uniquely ahead of all other bfabs


[13-Apr-24 02:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And DW/RAT is down quite a lot seemingly


[13-Apr-24 02:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
That tracks with my margins 🥲


[13-Apr-24 02:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
But this is very cool. I'm surprised that DW is still so high, but I guess the inputs are almost nothing if you buy water from the CX, let alone making it yourself somewhere

which of the materials that get used for extreme planets has to be used on every repair? I mean like INS, SEA, TSH, etc


[13-Apr-24 05:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
Someone else can correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe all of them are needed for repairs


[13-Apr-24 05:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk haven’t had to repair anything on Nike yet


[13-Apr-24 06:00 PM] tanda#0000
I'm mostly just curious, because I think I'd be interested in doing my best to drop the price on the one that's in the most demand/need


[13-Apr-24 06:01 PM] tanda#0000
I was thinking about what's stopping more systems from being fully utilized (besides just being bad planets) and was wondering if the cost of these materials is one of the main contributors to that


[13-Apr-24 06:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
One SEA base can pump out more than at least half of weekly trade


[13-Apr-24 06:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Plus you'd be able to pivot to producing something else like OFF also required for developing planets


[13-Apr-24 06:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And MCG


[13-Apr-24 06:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd imagine it's mostly the initial cost while there are still other planets available. Harmonia + Norwick + Etherwind is much cheaper for vertically integrated farming than the SE-110 system


[13-Apr-24 06:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also far from CX


[13-Apr-24 06:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So a consistent shipping route back and forth, a big LM, or begging devs for new CX would also need to happen


[13-Apr-24 06:06 PM] tanda#0000
am I just idealizing in system shipping perhaps? I thought an STL specced ship servicing a system with multiple bases would be cheaper than constantly jumping between locations


[13-Apr-24 06:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Idk if it's cheaper, but it's very satisfying to have an STL ship bringing everything to one planet for FTL ships to pick up


[13-Apr-24 06:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
and quite cheap to build an STL puddle jumper. but I think cost is more prohibitive than logistics for most players


[13-Apr-24 06:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Correction, one 100% efficiency base would make 4x weekly trade


[13-Apr-24 06:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think we'd need to look around and find a good cluster of planets close to each other that can focus on something currently overvalued in AI1. If they are between AI1 and a cheaper CX it would be even better


[13-Apr-24 06:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Like some absolute monster DW producing combo


[13-Apr-24 06:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ice station alpha + SE-110b 🙂


[13-Apr-24 06:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
SE-110b not Food production COGC tho


[13-Apr-24 06:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
SE-110A i mean


[13-Apr-24 06:16 PM] jvaler#0000
all of them. if it's used for construction it's used for repairs. even MHL for HYF


[13-Apr-24 06:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
i get those planets mixed up 😄


[13-Apr-24 06:18 PM] tanda#0000
actually that system is a great example of what I was thinking about


[13-Apr-24 06:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's got food production, agriculture, water extraction and resource extraction (for burning carbon)


[13-Apr-24 06:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If there was a great PG combo system it would be even better


[13-Apr-24 06:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But a DW pump is good


[13-Apr-24 06:22 PM] tanda#0000
Antares II?


[13-Apr-24 06:23 PM] tanda#0000
you've got all the source parts, as well as an resource extraction planet that even has hydrogen on it


[13-Apr-24 06:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well most of the cost is just carbon


[13-Apr-24 06:30 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i'm on 759g too extracting hydrogen, goated planet


[13-Apr-24 06:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[13-Apr-24 06:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe SE-110 system would work to make DW and C which could later be used for PG


[13-Apr-24 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
the more I play around with PRUN the more I like that idea


[13-Apr-24 07:19 PM] tanda#0000
if a bunch of people were willing to make a project of it, PG can be manufactured almost entirely in system (just importing C, which quite a few of us are doing already for Deimos)


[13-Apr-24 07:32 PM] tanda#0000
even without bonuses, a half-full ZV-759d extraction/manufacturing combo would be able to supply 4 full PG manufacture bases on the same planet


[13-Apr-24 07:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's not a bad idea at all


[13-Apr-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
a ZV-759g Hydrogen extraction base would be able to supply something like 6 of them, but that just rapidly turns into a logistical nightmare with that much output!


[13-Apr-24 07:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
...have we found a new ADI project? 😄


[13-Apr-24 07:39 PM] tanda#0000
driving down PG costs would help us develop further, right?


[13-Apr-24 07:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
making boatloads of money would help us develop further 🙂


[13-Apr-24 07:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
and maybe make BBH cheaper sometime down the road


[13-Apr-24 07:40 PM] tanda#0000
yes, but 4 bases is all the daily trading volume on AI1 per day


[13-Apr-24 07:40 PM] tanda#0000
prices would drop pretty quick

these base pricetags are a bit insane, though


[13-Apr-24 07:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Outside of C, all the other things required for it are rather cheap and plentiful on CX. I think as long as we have a few people on the C side and others on the PG side we are good


[13-Apr-24 07:55 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i will have a 759d base up and running by monday

[13-Apr-24 07:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
i think it'd fit well with all the folks making AL here. I could set up C production in SE-110


[13-Apr-24 07:56 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
and i will perhaps look at extending permits later down the line to produce excess resources for us

one of the major things they do is interest free no deadline loans for smaller players. (to be fair, the deimos and vulcan bases were basically to contract out my permits lmfao. but to be fairer i have 7mil in outstanding ship loans 😭)

[16-Apr-24 09:05 PM] evany.#0000
Do people specialize in planetary surveys? Can we expand Antares?


[16-Apr-24 09:07 PM] evany.#0000
Or maybe someone has already mapped the whole thing


[16-Apr-24 09:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Surveying is only a thing in faction contracts, you know what each planet is from the jump


[16-Apr-24 09:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If it gets added it would be after a universe reset


[16-Apr-24 09:15 PM] evany.#0000
Wait so I can’t go figure out what a planet is and go settle it ?


[16-Apr-24 09:16 PM] evany.#0000
Not that I want to but, it would be cool to find a good planet and claim it for Antares


[16-Apr-24 09:16 PM] evany.#0000
Do people do the survey contracts? It’s usually only like 2000 bucks so I never did one considering I’m pretty sure you’d spend more than that on fuel


[16-Apr-24 09:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I've never done one, sometimes you get survey contracts for your own planet


[16-Apr-24 09:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You can go to planet search and try to find a new good planet people have been sleeping on but you aren't uncovering what resources a planet has or anything else new


[16-Apr-24 10:43 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Planetary surveys aren’t worth it


[16-Apr-24 10:48 PM] evany.#0000
Boo would be cool to find a dope planet and just hide out there build a mega base with a group have our own secret handshake


[16-Apr-24 10:51 PM] evany.#0000
Do resources matter ? Like if I have an iron extractor and two planets, what’s the difference between 1/3 bars or 3/3 bars. Cycle time or does it bring up 6 units instead of 12 in same cycle time?


[17-Apr-24 02:43 AM] nyanism#0000
It does matter, higher rss density result in more rss per cycle*


[17-Apr-24 02:44 AM] evany.#0000
Makes sense

[18-Apr-24 11:40 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
@sidepipe what’s your DW/RAT production like? 
Like, how many do you make/day?


[18-Apr-24 11:40 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I’m Just thinking about future projects, might get into foods


[18-Apr-24 11:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
numbers are a little variable right now because I'm getting some new bases up and running in SE-110, but once things settle it'll be 660 RAT and 1080 DW / day


[18-Apr-24 11:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
making food isn't a bad idea, especially since the cost to manufacture it can be very low if you dedicate a farm and FP base to it


[18-Apr-24 11:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
especially if you get a plot on Harmonia while there's still space 🙂


[18-Apr-24 11:50 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Jeez 🥶


[18-Apr-24 11:50 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I thought about doing it using HYF but the water consumption is 💀


[18-Apr-24 11:52 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I got a base on Harmonia, 23 farms making HCP for my carbon farm


[18-Apr-24 11:52 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Next base will probs be on Life maybe


[18-Apr-24 11:53 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Gonna get my manufacturing base up this week and pump out Plastic sheets


[18-Apr-24 11:53 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Most likely PSL


[18-Apr-24 11:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
I have to recommend SE-110b because the governor is really cool, but either Life or SE-110b are good choices for HYF. I think Life is cheaper to build on, but SE-110b is really close to ice station alpha


[18-Apr-24 11:54 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
What’s good about station alpha?


[18-Apr-24 11:55 AM] igfloz#0000
My start is on Harmonia, and I found that running farms & RAT & DW (with a couple of Rigs) - expansion was problematic due to the water consumption. I've currently scaled back to just FRM now (slowly building up, I have 4 FRM currently)


[18-Apr-24 11:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
SE-110 has:
 - Ice station alpha for H20 extraction
 - SE-110b for HYF
 - SE-110a for Food industries
 - SE-110d for Resource extraction (burning carbon)


[18-Apr-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
wow that formatted weird. but it's all in the same system, so logistics get really easy if you build an STL only ship to jump from planet to planet


[18-Apr-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
but it is expensive to build in, so unless you're planning to make use of several of those, it might not be worth the extra investment over Life


[18-Apr-24 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
I did FRMs and RATs only for the same reason starting up


[18-Apr-24 12:00 PM] jvaler#0000
boucher if it was expensive and closer to antares
the fact that the water is liquid is very important because RIGs are faster and more space efficient than EXT or COL

[18-Apr-24 12:02 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah I just burn carbon, will look into making food and DW eventually


[18-Apr-24 12:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
I actually did my first water base on etherwind because it was much cheaper to set up, but shipping the water is _huge_ hassle


[18-Apr-24 12:02 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Just doing building fabs/plastics for now


[18-Apr-24 12:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm still trying to decide if it makes sense to do my own construction to keep repair costs down, or if it's more worthwhile to expand into other chemistry or food industries. but if you can spare the permits, food will always sell, or you can eat it yourself 😄


[18-Apr-24 12:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh and I need downsize my 3 permit harmonia base. I've been putting that off since two weeks after I started playing


[18-Apr-24 12:05 PM] jvaler#0000
money "saved" is money earned, and bfabs(and lfabs i think?) are quite profitable right now. ~90k/d for a minmaxxed construction base making BBH


[18-Apr-24 12:05 PM] jvaler#0000
worthwhile imo


[18-Apr-24 12:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I was looking into a mix of INS and bfabs, since I'm 99% of the way to having my own THF anyway


[18-Apr-24 12:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I now have a bunch of bases that need it 😄


[18-Apr-24 12:07 PM] jvaler#0000

[18-Apr-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000

sorry, having free bonus to metallurgy and construction for the faster building of antares is worth it


[20-Apr-24 03:35 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I'm merely making jokes. I've got carbon going in promitor.


[20-Apr-24 10:15 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Maybe Kirina & Libertas? About as close to Antares as NCE gets. It's a FEO metallurgy planet and a construction planet in the same system for bfabs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

FEO...

[20-Apr-24 10:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Antares you've got plenty of AL access. If you're building in NCE you might as well use it for its FEO, even if it is inferior


[20-Apr-24 10:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Or just build some random electronics base on malahat or something since it's usually easy to ship ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[20-Apr-24 10:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Any kind of base you could forget about for a month at a time and still make money from

There's a specific split they use of the profits to make it all work out but I'll refrain from sharing it here.


[20-Apr-24 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it is a guaranteed 75k a day profit.


[20-Apr-24 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which is much lower than if you sourced it all yourself though.


[20-Apr-24 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
But you aren't managing consumables nor repairs, so in all it works out quite well management wise.


[20-Apr-24 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
My thought process behind it was that's basically free grants, especially when we are slow and have nobody to pay.


[20-Apr-24 10:29 PM] jvaler#0000
literally 0 logi cost, anything would be worth it lol. well maybe like 20k/d min cause of the CONTD chore

[20-Apr-24 10:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
i've been way too busy these last weeks to figure out what to build next, so I just live vicariously through the planning that's done in here

[20-Apr-24 10:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
A strong antares is good for us all! I need more people to buy my RATs 😄


[20-Apr-24 10:56 PM] seacilia#0000
I'm starting to wonder if it's not the best plan to be striving for partial self sufficiency at least as far as RATs go. Maybe it would be healthier for me just to make goods and buy supplies. It would certainly be less complex than trying to cover all my bases.


[20-Apr-24 11:00 PM] jvaler#0000
100%
don't fall into the trap of conceptualizing stuff you make yourself as free, think of it as selling it to yourself.
now that doesn't mean self sufficiency is bad, but that you shouldn't neglect your projected profit numbers just because it supplies yourself. because your "savings" come from avoiding buying that commodity from the CX, and if the CX price is low your "savings" (increase in profit) is also low


[20-Apr-24 11:01 PM] jvaler#0000
the benefits you do get from the aspect of self sufficiency alone is immunization from market fluctuation and the convenience of not having to fill out CXPO buffers 😛


[20-Apr-24 11:02 PM] seacilia#0000
Yeah I'm seeing this, Rat is not much of an exploitable market from what I can tell. At least not right now. Which means that my excess stocks wouldn't sell well.


[20-Apr-24 11:03 PM] seacilia#0000
Construction however.


[20-Apr-24 11:03 PM] tanda#0000
I would be honest, if there were bigger RAT suppliers in here, I wouldn't buy off the CX at all


[20-Apr-24 11:03 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm
and the RAT market is generally pretty stable, so there shouldn't be any projected issues with relying on the CX for it


[20-Apr-24 11:03 PM] jvaler#0000
yesss 🔥🔥


[20-Apr-24 11:09 PM] seacilia#0000
I also want to ask about what everyone's thoughts are about having bases closer together. I've picked out some planets I really like, some are in the same systems, some are 4-8 jumps away. Perhaps it won't be much of an issue once I have a bigger fleet and the money to cover the FTL and thus make it worth settling down there in the long run for huge production efficiency gains.


[20-Apr-24 11:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Imo there isn’t a huge difference once you get beyond the two starter ships. I had a base on etherwind early on and it was an absolute PITA to haul water from there to harmonia though


[20-Apr-24 11:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Still is, but I have more ships, so relatively less annoying 😄


[20-Apr-24 11:12 PM] tanda#0000
I am still sub 120 days in the game, but I find myself really liking single systems that can support more than one base that work together. The real problem is there aren't too many of them


[20-Apr-24 11:12 PM] seacilia#0000
Totes


[20-Apr-24 11:13 PM] jvaler#0000
it can definitely make a difference, but depending on your real life schedule the difference a few hours of flight time makes could possibly not matter if you're not avaliable/awake to send the ship off right away. you can get a feel for flight times with the "test" button in a `BLU` buffer


[20-Apr-24 11:14 PM] seacilia#0000
Yeah I've been fiddling with that for my blueprints. I should map out some test flights along the logistics routes I had in mind. Thank you.

My ships are up for repairs soon. Is repairing and upgrading at the same time a thing ?


[25-Apr-24 09:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Don't know how it works


[25-Apr-24 10:00 PM] jvaler#0000
repairs are instant and can be done at any base you own or any planet with a shipyard. upgrades take time and can only be done at shipyards


[25-Apr-24 10:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Doesn't save any money ?


[25-Apr-24 10:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
This stuff is actually cheap, damn


[25-Apr-24 10:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I thought it was gonna be ~50-100k or something


[25-Apr-24 10:04 PM] jvaler#0000
like, doing it somewhere with a shipyard vs not? no, the repair bill is the same


[25-Apr-24 11:49 PM] nyanism#0000
ppl usually repair at 90% right?


[25-Apr-24 11:53 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think 80% is when the ship starts slowing down so I am doing it then


[26-Apr-24 12:01 AM] jvaler#0000
correct


[26-Apr-24 12:01 AM] jvaler#0000

I stopped expanding and didn't realize how much money I was making because I was giving so much away to new players. The other day I did the math and it was a little crazy 😅 my stockpile are enormous, I've given away 5m in free ship upgrades and 3m in grants. But my cash balance has stayed basically the same cause I just like *things* more than money so any time I hit 3m I go on a spending spree, lol

[30-Apr-24 04:41 AM] evany.#0000
When is a good time for a new player to upgrade ships?  When you can no longer move things in a single trip? I don’t know where the fuel efficiency cut off is. Is it worth upgrading both ships or maybe just one? I’m getting close to 60 days old and I want to use that guys cheap for noobs upgrade before I’m too old, but that’s a lot of money too probably could afford it next week for one ship. Thoughts? Suggestions? Shut it noobface?


[30-Apr-24 04:49 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i upgraded one of my ships at about 70-75 days in, depends what you're doing. I upgraded one of mine and put a WCB in it because i was shifting lots of FE and AL which is heavy.


[30-Apr-24 05:43 AM] evany.#0000
He still gave you the discount at 75 days ?


[30-Apr-24 06:08 AM] nyanism#0000
I think is offer is opened for up to 180 days old

@sidepipe i'm back out here buying more but i sold a bunch of stuff so now i got my bases stocked up but now i'm just going round topping them up now, because before i was letting their level fall too low, now i'm able to buy enough and keep them topped up every few days or so.


[30-Apr-24 05:03 PM] sidepipe#0000

1 STL -> 8 MFK @ 148/u = 1184 AIC
but 1 STL on the CX is worth between 1700 and 1450 AIC


[02-May-24 12:12 AM] jvaler#0000
and that doesn't even consider consumables and degradation


[02-May-24 12:12 AM] jvaler#0000
wack


[02-May-24 12:14 AM] jvaler#0000
hell i value my PT so low because i price my STL at 1200/u due to my private deals with rise(if i wasn't using it myself i'd be selling it to them at that price)
but 1184 for 8 MFK is even lower than that 😭


[02-May-24 01:33 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
It’s because I have so much STL atm, so idm it being cheap 😂
I’ll maybe look at putting price up in future

I just make a lot of it and wanted to sell it here, but it’s so cheap that no internal price really makes sense. So I just give it away 😄


[05-May-24 10:32 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
PiBoy is actually trying to lower the price down to 120, but as soon as he started producing the biggest INS maker in the game just disappeared, so it's slowly climbing instead now 🙃 his whole purpose with the massive INS operation he started was to lower the cost and hopefully make expanding to other planets more affordable now that many starters are filling up. Instead he just accidentally saved everyone from what would have probably been an insanely expensive INS supply shortage, lol

[07-May-24 06:48 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Nvm. Scrapped my PE shenanigan plans because demand increased by another 1.5m at ANT and PiBoy offered a recurring deal where he does the shipping... 😅 just made 10m in like 2 minutes. I've never had this much cash... time to blow it all on rfabs again, lol


[07-May-24 06:55 AM] tanda#0000
I'd be interested in hearing what the plan was


[07-May-24 07:04 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If it wasn't for the insane demand for PE at ANT, I was only a couple weeks away from having more PE than all 6 CX asks combined... I kinda just wanted to clear them all just to see what happened 😅 but then PiBoy and Rwinner increased demand and my shipping just can't keep up with that (I make it all on Katoa)


[07-May-24 07:05 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I could clear the other 5 easy, but they're both buying 1m at a time 🙃 that's 5 ships worth


[07-May-24 07:06 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
So I just sold what I had and made a deal with PiBoy cause I'm a lame sell-out

[07-May-24 08:19 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000

here's what an EXT plan would look like. this still uses 5 metallurgy experts because that's still the largest portion of profits

only 5k less per day is pretty good

especially because we aren't considering fuel costs of transporting ALO


[09-May-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
well you don't have to transport *all* the ALO, there's lots of players who exclusively mine ALO on deimos and sell it on the local market


[09-May-24 01:30 PM] antisyntax#0000
ah


[09-May-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
so you get it cheaper *and* don't pay for shipping


[09-May-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
the running rate last i checked is ~75/u


[09-May-24 01:31 PM] antisyntax#0000
what's the cost of all those constructions?

i've been using that slightly


[09-May-24 01:36 PM] jvaler#0000
the thing about C is that it *looks* expensive, and it is a large portion of smelting expenses, but making it yourself doesn't make it any cheaper.

you have to understand that any money you "save" is the same as if you sold it to yourself instead of the CX. the value of the item hasn't changed, you just produced it yourself instead of buying it off the CX. 

therefore the profit on actually making that item is very important, and C isn't all that lucrative in that regard imo

the profit margins on C aren't actually that impressive for the logistics and FRMs required, so the current CX price is rather low imo (screenshot of INC ROI a few weeks ago) https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183249178156089374/1229137487411154987

so it'd be a better use of both land area and capital to just buy it from the CX. especially on deimos, you don't want to run INC on deimos because they don't benefit from the metallurgy CoGC bonus

so what's your decision @antisyntax? mixed EXT/SME base, or do you wanna do a 20 SME base and buy ALO off the LM for an extra ~10k/d profit


[09-May-24 01:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think there's also probably someone here that was interested in doing a full EXT base for consistent cheap ALO, if they hadn't already gone through with it.


[09-May-24 01:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
hm... the 20 SME uses up all 500 area right?

the plot system only limits construction of new bases, you're free to add additional permits to existing bases regardless of the plot limit

[09-May-24 01:50 PM] jvaler#0000
most players recommend making a second base rather than expanding your first because permits are a valuable resource. you upgrade your HQ to get more of them, and each upgrade becomes increasingly expensive https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OkchGBPadxmlv0hDgk0FZmC223fVD9RjsMbV-ibUI4E/edit#gid=0

getting a second base also opens up new opportunities to diversify, because that second planet can be a different CoGC type

[09-May-24 01:52 PM] antisyntax#0000
then ill probaby do that. do a 20 SME base on Deimos, and eventually open a second extraction base to send stuff to deimos


[09-May-24 01:53 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm... i hate to be such a downer 😭 but turning that AL into basic prefabs on nike is much more lucrative and less logistically intensive(if you have a WCB, AL fits better into a WCB than ALO does)

lemme pull up the numbers

Harmonia = FRM/SME for C

[09-May-24 01:58 PM] antisyntax#0000
ah


[09-May-24 01:59 PM] jvaler#0000
so antares has not 1 but 2 highly ALO rich planets, both of which require no extra special building materials to build on. nascent is that second planet, and you only need 7 EXT to fully fulfill the ALO demands of a 20 SME base. that's why the rest of the space is used for INC. but those INC require a full 500 area harmonia FRM base to supply (the agri market is pretty thin, so i wouldn't rely on it for higher throughput stuff like this)

i've priced ALO at 75/u because this would be replacing your deimos LM supply which was at that cost. it used to make ~40k/d, but C seems to have become more profitable and it now makes ~45k/d

however nike is *much* better, 1 second

I.e; RIG/FRM/SME 
Made things go slower until I made myself a dedicated SME base for C, and put more FRM on Harmonia.


[09-May-24 01:59 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Just takes some shuffling about


[09-May-24 02:02 PM] antisyntax#0000
so which is the cheapest bfab to produce on Nike? AL+LST=BSE, or GL+AL=BTA, or something else?


[09-May-24 02:06 PM] jvaler#0000
this is nike, antares' primary construction planet. it has local LST deposits which creates opportunities to buy LST locally for cheaper just like ALO on deimos.
one 20 SME AL base can fully provide for the needs of a 15 PP2 BBH base

basic prefabs (BFABs) are a very safe thing to sell because their price is very stable due to the market maker placed on them. this is great because they happen to also be very profitable at ~70k/d for BBH. that's even assuming CX LST prices, which you can get cheaper on nike.

there's one catch though, and that's the low pressure condition of the planet. this makes building here more expensive because you have to use INS based on the area of the buildings https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/building-costs/index.html#costs-calculation
but as you can see even through that the ROI is quite good at ~15d with current prices

[09-May-24 02:07 PM] jvaler#0000
so BFABs on nike is both less logistically intensive and more profitable than ALO on nascent


[09-May-24 02:09 PM] antisyntax#0000
so basically, in order of priority, I should have my bases as such:

(1) Deimos (ZV-759c): 20 SME (AL) <- LM Buy ALO until (3)
(2) Nike (ZV-194a): 15 PP2 (BBH) <- LM Buy LST
(3) Nascent (QJ-149c): EXT (ALO)

with 750k+50k starting cash 12 SME should be reasonable to build right away. that leaves you with ~300k to stock up on inputs and consumables.

i can also sell you some ALO out of my own buffer to help get you started right away without waiting on LM ads to fulfill

[09-May-24 02:29 PM] jvaler#0000

you can manually change the price of a contract with the `Condition` button to set it to 1 AIC

[09-May-24 02:31 PM] jvaler#0000
you'll need to fly them to ANT to buy stuff


[09-May-24 02:31 PM] jvaler#0000
then load that stuff on the ships and fly them back to build


[09-May-24 02:32 PM] jvaler#0000

[09-May-24 02:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
STO?


[09-May-24 02:42 PM] jvaler#0000
storage, bottom of the infrastructure category


[09-May-24 02:43 PM] antisyntax#0000
ah ok


[09-May-24 02:43 PM] antisyntax#0000
how many of those should i have?


[09-May-24 02:43 PM] antisyntax#0000
and will i have the area?


[09-May-24 02:43 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh yeah i will


[09-May-24 02:43 PM] antisyntax#0000
ill have like 60 left


[09-May-24 02:44 PM] antisyntax#0000
so i can have 4 STOs


[09-May-24 02:44 PM] acramernc#0000

1 or 2 STO is usually plenty, especially for a new player


[09-May-24 02:44 PM] antisyntax#0000
ok


[09-May-24 02:44 PM] jvaler#0000
so i'd say-

yeah ^


[09-May-24 02:45 PM] jvaler#0000
60 left? if you're planning on 20 SME only 2 STO will fit


[09-May-24 02:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
SME are 17ea. and HB1's are 10


[09-May-24 02:46 PM] antisyntax#0000
so 100 and 340


[09-May-24 02:46 PM] jvaler#0000
the CM also takes up 25 area

[09-May-24 02:52 PM] .shiva.#0000
Something to consider is that the starter ships can't really handle that many SME well, at least imo.


[09-May-24 02:52 PM] .shiva.#0000
The planner has a button that says how often you'll need to import/export in a popup

with 500/500 ships you need to import basically every day, which is a little painful

it's more that you need to be avilable to buy, and send the ships 2x a day, every day, or your production stops

[09-May-24 03:31 PM] flor2081#0000
looking at it like that, adding 1 FLX gives 1 more AL


[09-May-24 03:31 PM] antisyntax#0000
so then i take it flux is cheaper than 1 al?


[09-May-24 03:31 PM] flor2081#0000
yup


[09-May-24 03:31 PM] antisyntax#0000
okie dokie


[09-May-24 03:32 PM] flor2081#0000
you can also check with prunplanner, but basically the efficiency is higher if you add FLX


[09-May-24 03:32 PM] flor2081#0000
=> less ALO/O/C to ship too


[09-May-24 03:32 PM] antisyntax#0000
noice


[09-May-24 03:34 PM] tanda#0000
Most of the tonnage can be sourced locally. I haven't imported ALO in months


[09-May-24 03:36 PM] antisyntax#0000

it will be for the 200 you actually have

[09-May-24 08:22 PM] antisyntax#0000
ok i spent like almost 800k, i have like 5200 left, but...
I have the mats for a 10 HB1, 20 SME base.
I have the supplies to sustain all 1,000 workers for 8 days including both luxuries.
I have the C, O, and Flux to produce 75 orders of 4 AL (as well as the ALO for 16 orders, and with the LM, easily purchaseable)... My ships are 787.45 / 1000t full.


[09-May-24 08:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Can your 500/500 ships carry the daily import/export of 20 SME ?

dunno 😛


[09-May-24 08:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh yea, and once i complete the tutorial contract (first prod order), ill have enough liquid to get another 100 ALO


[09-May-24 08:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Probably fine rn, before you build another base probably try to make your own ALO to fit all the import/export on one ship

okhow to i make a plan in prunplanner?


[09-May-24 08:38 PM] antisyntax#0000
i dont see any way to add a base / plan


[09-May-24 08:38 PM] antisyntax#0000
it just says head to management but theres no add button for bases


[09-May-24 08:38 PM] tanda#0000
you gotta go through planet search, then there's a plus sign next to the planet you want


[09-May-24 08:38 PM] tanda#0000
so go to planet search, find the planet you're looking for, then hit the + button

(or wait did you need to make a blank empire first? It's been a couple months)


[09-May-24 08:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
i did that already


[09-May-24 08:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
thx


[09-May-24 08:39 PM] tanda#0000
okay, yeah, then you gotta do the planet search thing


[09-May-24 08:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
are the material costs still borked?


[09-May-24 08:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
its saying i should be making 20k when i should be making 40-45k


[09-May-24 08:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If it says the AL base will be making 20k that's probably accurate 😢


[09-May-24 08:44 PM] tanda#0000
yeah... AL is not intensely profitable most days


[09-May-24 08:45 PM] tanda#0000
hmmm!


[09-May-24 08:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It hasn't been above 30k for any serious period of time since I started lol


[09-May-24 08:45 PM] tanda#0000
actually how is your CX setttings set up?


[09-May-24 08:46 PM] tanda#0000
I'm AI1 BID/ASK so it's a bit optimistic, but I'm still showing 40k

[09-May-24 08:51 PM] antisyntax#0000
how am i getting entirely different numbers?


[09-May-24 08:51 PM] antisyntax#0000
the ALO cost i understand because i set that to 75/ea, but the prod rates are different


[09-May-24 08:51 PM] tanda#0000
did you remember to set the COGC bonus for your base?


[09-May-24 08:52 PM] antisyntax#0000
metallurgy


[09-May-24 08:52 PM] antisyntax#0000
then again i think prunplanner is bugging out. i set the experts to 5 and the profit literally didn't change


[09-May-24 08:52 PM] tanda#0000
I had to reload after every change


[09-May-24 08:53 PM] antisyntax#0000
yeah i hit save and it didn't oh well ill just figure it out


[09-May-24 08:53 PM] antisyntax#0000
tomorrow


[09-May-24 08:53 PM] antisyntax#0000
as long as im making profit im happy

I can promise you that if you can handle the logistics, use the LM for ALO and lean on this group where you need to, you will make money

[09-May-24 09:48 PM] tanda#0000
no idea why, they just have


[09-May-24 10:29 PM] nyanism#0000
prolly an attemp to push it up?


[09-May-24 10:32 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, looks like it. I know a few people in here have been saying that it's really not worth producing at this point


[09-May-24 10:32 PM] tanda#0000
so perhaps they just decided to stabilize it at a pricepoint above break even


[09-May-24 10:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
CU also means hauling a small mountain back and forth daily. Can't even fit on both your ships


[09-May-24 10:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
AL is uniquely light compared to other metals and it's still close to the 500t back and forth limit depending on how you make your base


[09-May-24 11:06 PM] tanda#0000
you can transport 185 AL on one starter ship


[09-May-24 11:39 PM] jvaler#0000
it's a known bug that's been around basically forever


[09-May-24 11:40 PM] jvaler#0000
the devs are... kinda slow


[09-May-24 11:42 PM] jvaler#0000
take that with a large grain of salt, you need to sanity check numbers like that to see if the CX traded volume actually makes it possible to sell that much off at those prices. afaik CU wouldn't have the kind of market to support numbers like that

it's a more niche material mainly used in electronics which is later game/higher tier and therefore more often vertically integrated by players

[09-May-24 11:46 PM] jvaler#0000
600/u is much more sane AL pricing which gives average profits of 40-50k/d for a 500 area base


[10-May-24 06:47 AM] antisyntax#0000
so i did my math wrong, and am short 6 BDE... so i guess im at 18 sme for the time being


[10-May-24 06:49 AM] antisyntax#0000
actually ill just demo one of my STOs until then

[10-May-24 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
how much do you need?


[10-May-24 06:53 AM] antisyntax#0000
whatever 12.5k can buy


[10-May-24 06:53 AM] antisyntax#0000
ideally im 320 short, but i doubht i can buy all that for 12.5k


[10-May-24 06:55 AM] tanda#0000
I could do 182 for 10k. roughly 55 c/u

ah


[10-May-24 07:20 AM] antisyntax#0000
i actually might remove the CX window in top left because if i have the CXPO screens and this is just for resupplying, then i don't need the CX. that's in the CX screen.that way i can put a XIT Burn in there

I was gonna say that it's the same prices as other CXs now but some have jumped up to 700 for some reason


[10-May-24 10:11 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I still think it should be a bit under 600 for that CX advantage and flair

So I may be working on programming a Discord bot that you can use to track certain LM and CX orders, so for instance you can watch ALO orders, and it will send you a DM when one comes in so you can snag it up!

It may take a while to make 🤣

Either way, my main motivation was Antares, I loved the faction and the people in it and really wish I could have done so much more for the faction as a whole, but the game isn't developed enough to really allow anything like that.

I won't say the game was misleading or anything, I knew at every point what I was invested in, but eventually it just became a chore, and then a job, and then the annoyed messages of "where's x" started showing up and it just became a headache.

[14-May-24 12:20 AM] realharvey#0000
Or just buy it all up then and sell it for higher? 😂👀


[14-May-24 12:20 AM] jvaler#0000
i don't like playing like that... the risk is scary to me. and it just feels unrewarding


[14-May-24 12:20 AM] .shiva.#0000
it's not something that moves super quick, and that would be cost prohibitive for me unfortunately lol


[14-May-24 12:21 AM] jvaler#0000
what is it?


[14-May-24 12:21 AM] .shiva.#0000
CF


[14-May-24 12:21 AM] jvaler#0000
inch resting


[14-May-24 12:23 AM] jvaler#0000
if i were you i'd just drop it down to 5000


[14-May-24 12:25 AM] jvaler#0000
iirc there's a limit of like 10 placed orders of the same commodity per day to prevent tiny bidding wars like these


[14-May-24 12:25 AM] jvaler#0000
so be careful


[14-May-24 12:26 AM] jvaler#0000
i can't seem to find where that's stated though


[14-May-24 12:26 AM] .shiva.#0000
oh interesting, hm


[14-May-24 12:26 AM] .shiva.#0000
it started today at like 5.6


[14-May-24 12:26 AM] .shiva.#0000
the other small order was lowering it as well


[14-May-24 12:27 AM] .shiva.#0000
if its 10, they might not be able to do it that many more times


[14-May-24 12:34 AM] jvaler#0000
okay i just tested it... very interesting

The graph has been basically flatlined for the past 180 days and this is the only noticeable spike

[14-May-24 10:08 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

I’ll be getting another 3 Chem plants soon on ZV-759d so I’ll be bashing FLX out of 7 Chem plants daily, so I’ll sell it cheap


[14-May-24 10:09 AM] acramernc#0000
C constitutes like 80% of my expenses between PG and AL 😢


[14-May-24 10:09 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I’m scraping by with my C production 😂


[14-May-24 10:11 AM] acramernc#0000
i don't think i realized how little C a base can produce


[14-May-24 10:12 AM] acramernc#0000
a full harmonia FRM setup feeding 13 nascent INC still does not cover my current c consumption


[14-May-24 10:13 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well make more C on nascent


[14-May-24 10:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
26 INC


[14-May-24 10:15 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'd be surprised if C stayed that high


[14-May-24 10:15 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah making C doesnt feel great. It consumes alot of permits


[14-May-24 10:17 AM] acramernc#0000
regardless of the permit cost, if i can help stabilize the C market i'd be happy


[14-May-24 10:18 AM] acramernc#0000
yeah but then my farms won't be able to keep up


[14-May-24 10:18 AM] acramernc#0000

Give me a week so I can sort my base out but I can supply that


[14-May-24 12:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
13 FRM growing 4xH2O  => GRN can feed a full permit of 30 INC with 50 GRN/d to spare. Occasionally make or buy some HCP+MAI to burn the excess


[14-May-24 12:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Produces almost 200 C/d


[14-May-24 12:09 PM] jvaler#0000
just because it makes up 80% of the expenses doesn't mean it's unreasonable. C isn't entirely easy to make and it's inputs aren't cheap

{Reactions}
👆 

[14-May-24 12:09 PM] acramernc#0000
hmm ok so i did have it setup wrong


[14-May-24 12:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Fast GRN with the 1 input C recipe is the way to go


[14-May-24 12:09 PM] acramernc#0000
yeah i know that but when the market for my biggest expense is as volatile as c is in ant rn, then its a problem


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
hm yeah


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
i expect it will stabilize again soon though


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
just needs to find a new equilibrium


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] acramernc#0000
esp when i don't have the capital to build a buffer or place long term buy orders


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
~650/u is my bet


[14-May-24 12:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
True. Margins for C are rough, but stability and market resilience have value


[14-May-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000

I don’t think @tanda had sell ads on the LM?


[16-May-24 01:10 PM] jvaler#0000
right they had buy ads?


[16-May-24 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I don’t think Tanda had buy ads either… I think people just remembered that Tanda said he had some excess ALO prod on Deimos?


[16-May-24 01:13 PM] jvaler#0000

the LM is so saturated with them rn i won't get any takers


[16-May-24 03:09 PM] jvaler#0000
though the ALO EXT people on deimos are kinda slacking lately it seems


[16-May-24 03:10 PM] antisyntax#0000
if i had some spare money i'd expand my base with another permit (i know, i know) and throw the rest of the space with EXTs


[16-May-24 03:10 PM] jvaler#0000
a 14 EXT base on deimos makes ~500 ALO/d, they should be able to fulfill what's there


[16-May-24 03:10 PM] jvaler#0000
but 🤷‍♀️


[16-May-24 03:11 PM] antisyntax#0000

i posted there but haven't heard anything in a few


[16-May-24 03:12 PM] acramernc#0000
i can probably throw a few extractors down on deimos in a week or so and supply some of that demand


[16-May-24 03:12 PM] acramernc#0000
my deimos base is mostly empty rn


[16-May-24 03:13 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't think they've gotten around to handing them out yet


[16-May-24 03:13 PM] antisyntax#0000
ok


[16-May-24 03:17 PM] antisyntax#0000
yeah thats going to cost me about 255k, i can get about half that if i sell my AL currently stored


[16-May-24 03:18 PM] antisyntax#0000
though i do have 4 days of ALO left, so i could just let it run dry, save all the money, and just produce ALO from my own EXTs when i run out / have enough money


[16-May-24 03:21 PM] antisyntax#0000
hell assuming i can source the materials, i could probably do the expansion tomorrow


[16-May-24 06:15 PM] avalock#0000
i’m building up on ALO how much you need?


[16-May-24 06:35 PM] antisyntax#0000
depends. how much do you charge /u?


[16-May-24 06:36 PM] avalock#0000
last sale i did was 80/u i’m at nascent which is kinda out of your way


[16-May-24 06:38 PM] antisyntax#0000
hm... yeah thats quite a long flight on starter vessels. do you have any at ANT by chance?


[16-May-24 06:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
if not, ill see if anyone else has any at ANT/Deimos. I've got 4 days of ALO atm. so im not desperate, but ill turn to you if i do 🙂


[16-May-24 07:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How much do you have at Nascent? I could buy some and bring @antisyntax as well?


[16-May-24 07:01 PM] avalock#0000

If I bulk up, I take something close to 3k ALO in one go (if I can)

[16-May-24 11:22 PM] jvaler#0000
as long as it's on top it's fine. increasing it any further has little impact on the rate it's fulfilled in my experience.
probably because if someone's desperate enough to sell to bids they don't really have a choice to be picky about the price unless it's really abysmal

and if you look, the LM is full of ALO buy ads

[17-May-24 09:15 AM] avalock#0000
:giggle: heard, once i get set up there i can start supplying


[17-May-24 09:17 AM] antisyntax#0000
i also plan on supplying some of my own ALO needs by expanding and getting some EXTs up and running, but i'll still have a net negative supply, and it's going to cost almost 300k, so that's a ways off


[17-May-24 11:53 AM] tanda#0000
I am in the anti multiple permit crowd. I would rather fund a base to buy from than supply my own.

An exception is Nike and maybe Harmonia


[17-May-24 11:53 AM] antisyntax#0000
i mean ideally i would build a second one, one smelting and one mining, but Deimos is full atm.

[17-May-24 05:26 PM] avalock#0000
yeee for deimos


[17-May-24 05:27 PM] jvaler#0000
unless you sell on-site, but the LM demand for FEO seems to be fulfilled atm. i'm a bit more in-touch with that than ALO on deimos cause i actually buy FEO from there lol

Electronics is just such a bad bonus for new players. And despite playing such a significant role in the game CoCGs aren't explained *at all* by tutorials or displayed at starting planet selection. At this point though it might be easier to convince the devs to change starting planet options than to flip Phobos CoGC...

in this game? mostly time and well used loans 🤷‍♀️


[17-May-24 06:58 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

Grats! that will be me one day too


[20-May-24 12:24 AM] evany.#0000
unrelated note- but how do you read these? 

if i had to take a stab at it
i'd put green @ buy orders red at sell orders
grey on the bottom as volume/units moved
and blue at some sort of averaged price for the volume moved (probably against an average?

It's called "candlestick" stock charts


[20-May-24 12:45 AM] coolfeather2#0000
Color just indicates the movement for that time period


[20-May-24 12:47 AM] coolfeather2#0000
Red means: market closed lower than when it opened
Green means: market closed higher than when it opened

[20-May-24 01:46 AM] avalock#0000
(but real talk) 
the blue like is a simple moving average over 10 candlestick bars or periods of trading

if you want the formula it’s SMA = SUM(A1+ A3+ A4+ … +Ax)/x

A is the price of a commodity at that period
x is total number of periods


[20-May-24 01:47 AM] avalock#0000
(honestly for trading commodities having 1 SMA i kinda useless, as you’re just seeing upwards momentum but like in an analysis field you would want more indications of strength)

Yeah my tf2 should be higher too, I was on a semi-pro circuit team that never went anywhere but had hours upon hours of sniper practice. That entire forum / group fell apart but we still all practiced together. 😅

It’s funny - playing X3 and X4, I always kind of wished for an MMO space economy game, but without all the PvP of Eve online. I didn’t realize it existed the whole time 😄


[21-May-24 10:48 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, EVE manufacture chains spoiled me. I used to love doing things as simple as planning out drone manufacture supply lines

I feel like this game has just the right amount of player interaction. It’s very easy to help others, but you’ll never lose everything because someone else felt like ruining your day


[21-May-24 11:01 PM] sidepipe#0000

do they die or just stop production?


[22-May-24 09:11 PM] evany.#0000
they just slow down until you have no consumables

@tanda would you be willing to sell me 500 AL in a week or so at ANT? Would pay 650/u or so for your time


[22-May-24 09:50 PM] tanda#0000
absolutely, I can commit to that. that's a couple days production I'll just stock at ANT

[23-May-24 11:53 AM] tanda#0000
I can sell, but give me a few days. I sold down to a week's supply and resupply is a couple days out. 
I don't generate enough to sell large scale, so this is going to have to be it for a while, though I am expanding production in the next few weeks

How much you owe for H?


[30-May-24 01:40 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
And how much did you buy?


[30-May-24 01:48 AM] evany.#0000
i think just 100k - i convinced him to delivery because i can't haul that much hahaha


[30-May-24 01:49 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Wait, you bought 100k H? Or you spent 100k on H


[30-May-24 01:49 AM] evany.#0000
10days worth so 1k!


[30-May-24 01:49 AM] evany.#0000
100k on H


[30-May-24 01:49 AM] evany.#0000
would be wild to buy 100k H


[30-May-24 01:49 AM] evany.#0000

the 0 interest is always tempting, whats the range / duration allow for such offer xD


[30-May-24 10:58 PM] jvaler#0000
duration indefinite, amount depending on what you plan to do with it


[30-May-24 10:59 PM] nyanism#0000

this is pretty informal


[30-May-24 11:04 PM] nyanism#0000
well, for the record, i applied for agp, didnt get it due to they doesnt believe i'll work in antares space,
anyway im beyond the point where i'll look for grant, but loans, yes i still sought after those (cant even write in AGP ch haha)

will write sth up and pass to you later maybe today/tmr

[31-May-24 05:31 PM] razesdark#0000
What is WCB?


[31-May-24 05:32 PM] lossi#0000
Wide cargo bay


[31-May-24 05:32 PM] lossi#0000
Or wet


[31-May-24 05:33 PM] lossi#0000
Idr, but basically it's a bigger cargo bay


[31-May-24 05:38 PM] jvaler#0000
`MAT WCB` ingame

i imagine it stands for "weight cargo bay" as opposed to the VCB being "volume cargo bay"


[31-May-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
because it has a capacity of 3000t/1000m^3, it specializes in high mass items


[31-May-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
whereas the VCB is for high volume items (1000t/3000m^3)


[31-May-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
and the LCB "large cargo bay" is general purpose (2000t/2000m^3)


[31-May-24 05:49 PM] lossi#0000
That sounds right, thanks c:


[31-May-24 06:05 PM] razesdark#0000

whats a corporation ?


[01-Jun-24 08:16 PM] tanda#0000
a group of player companies, primary benefits seem to be the corp HQ, which provides a bonus to a planet for all corp members


[01-Jun-24 08:16 PM] evany.#0000
oh tanda we definitely need to build an hq


[01-Jun-24 08:17 PM] tanda#0000
I believe @jvaler  is currently transporting the mats necessary to construct an HQ to Elon


[01-Jun-24 08:17 PM] evany.#0000
the players guide says theres other buildings after hq


[01-Jun-24 08:17 PM] evany.#0000
but it doesn't specify what those are


[01-Jun-24 08:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah most corps are more of an out-of-game group. the benefits are self made and mostly involve collaborating together in discord and on group projects and stuff. in the game, the only mechanical benefit is the production bonus from building a corp HQ


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
there are other corp projects that will be possible in the future, but right now that's basically it


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] evany.#0000
can you make multiple ones?


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] evany.#0000
i.e one on different planets


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
negative


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] evany.#0000
boooo


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
just the one,  yeah


[01-Jun-24 08:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

I think I'm going to make one for me on a chem planet I'm expanding. KAWA's main corp HQ is on Etherwind


[01-Jun-24 08:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
if that was possible, then everyone in the game would probably just join one big corp with HQs everywhere, lol


[01-Jun-24 08:20 PM] tanda#0000
most likely, and that would just get confusing


[01-Jun-24 08:20 PM] tanda#0000

KAWAs main C producer recently stopped playing 😭 they supplied most of our C but didn't sell to CX so that's not why prices jumped. But the timing couldn't have been worse for trying to outsource some🙃

seems like the bridge and the crew quarters are really the bad ones


[04-Jun-24 05:57 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yep, that's why the timing sucks so much. normally if there's a shortage I've been trying to be a sort of 'cushion'. I'll buy things from other groups I'm in like here or AA, or CX if I have to, then sell those things back to the corp at a loss while we sort out our production shortage. The spike in C on CX at the same time as our shortage means I can't afford to do that at all. Adding our consumption to the CX suddenly would also make the problem worse for everyone else... so... we're just kind of stalled. It's literally cheaper for me to build 6 whole bases (3 FRM bases and 3 INC bases) than to buy C from CX. 🙃


[04-Jun-24 05:57 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we're making it though. Knarfaction had a stockpile of about 40k C that we've mostly eaten through...

[12-Jun-24 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
idk it is the definitive edtion remaster they released like 3 years ago so maybe some new peps


[12-Jun-24 09:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I also got my ass handed to me in AoE4 so


[12-Jun-24 09:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
maybe I'm just bad


[12-Jun-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000
I’m down sometime to play


[12-Jun-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000
I too am terrible


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] tanda#0000
cavalry rushes are still a thing?


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] tanda#0000
I hated online deatmatch because nothing about it actually led to real gameplay


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I got rushed a few times with those


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] tanda#0000
at least how I always saw it


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I just tried to archers and stuffs


[12-Jun-24 10:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok I’m down


[13-Jun-24 07:03 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
My wife plays AoE2 so much, it's her favorite. I coach her sometimes cause I don't like playing but I *love* watching RTSs, lol. Yeah that online scene is brutal. The game has the massive skill potential of starcraft but with a much much smaller community.


[13-Jun-24 07:03 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
The new version has amazing practice modes though


[13-Jun-24 07:05 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Just start by mastering the first ~10m and things like castle rushing. That's about as far as I learned cause I don't have the instincts for that game 😅


[13-Jun-24 08:49 AM] .urpalhal#0000
lol I thought I had been bc I could beat the AI pretty easily


[13-Jun-24 09:21 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
You watch any YouTube videos? There's some really great content creators for that game. It's one of the many many games that I watch a lot and never play, lol

but i mostly played aoe4 lately. i played the remaster the weekend it came out and thats about it


[13-Jun-24 12:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I’ve been trying to play the games I own but have only a few hours in

AoE2's campaigns especially El Cid were fantastic

[13-Jun-24 01:52 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I predict


[13-Jun-24 01:52 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
AL will drop in 3 days or earlier


[13-Jun-24 01:53 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
C has been stable*


[13-Jun-24 01:54 PM] tanda#0000
I hope so, that high AL is making Nike look really weak

Prepare for selling 500/u AL again


[13-Jun-24 02:00 PM] tanda#0000
It's going to be nice having some margin on BFABS again


[13-Jun-24 02:00 PM] tanda#0000
it's been pushed up against the MM pretty hard for a bit


[13-Jun-24 02:01 PM] tanda#0000
enough that I was starting to think about stopping bfab production for a few weeks and just selling AL


[13-Jun-24 02:01 PM] flor2081#0000
huh? bfabs prices are high so you want to stop making them?


[13-Jun-24 02:02 PM] flor2081#0000
i think i'm missing something


[13-Jun-24 02:04 PM] evany.#0000
idk bfabs are kind of bad for awhile now it seemed to me 
  2 al and limestone at market is over 1500$ for 2100
then add upkeep onto the 1500 and your maybe only making 200-300$ per unitover


[13-Jun-24 02:04 PM] evany.#0000
and bbh is the most profitable one when i've looked through them a few times


[13-Jun-24 02:04 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah but usually you mine your own AL too then


[13-Jun-24 02:05 PM] evany.#0000
still has the same cost regardless


[13-Jun-24 02:05 PM] evany.#0000
whether i sell it for 700 or mine it myself its still worth 700


[13-Jun-24 02:05 PM] flor2081#0000
nono, what I mine myself is free 😄

bfabs are expensive alright, but they got artificially capped by the MM a bit there too. (which is the point of the MM)

[13-Jun-24 02:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They made it


[13-Jun-24 02:28 PM] tanda#0000
is HQ20 the last really relevant upgrade?


[13-Jun-24 02:29 PM] tanda#0000
it looks like it gets so expensive you could sponsor 3 bases for the cost of each level


[13-Jun-24 02:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
🤷‍♂️


[13-Jun-24 02:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Come on let’s get to HQ lvl 45 ☺️


[13-Jun-24 02:30 PM] tanda#0000
dude, I can't even conceive of having 180mil to spend on one upgrade level


[13-Jun-24 02:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Theoretically you’d have 40 something bases at that point


[13-Jun-24 02:32 PM] acramernc#0000
if you've got 40 bases making an average of like 50k/day that's 2 mil a day


[13-Jun-24 02:32 PM] acramernc#0000
180 mil every 90 days


[13-Jun-24 02:32 PM] tanda#0000
that is still 90 days of income


[13-Jun-24 02:32 PM] tanda#0000
no wonder all the higher level players are loan sharks


[13-Jun-24 02:33 PM] acramernc#0000
i don't even know how i would manage 40 bases lol


[13-Jun-24 02:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fire has the current highest HQ lvl. They're on the leaderboards for all 4 afabs, so they're making *a lot* of it themselves to make that possible. It's still insanely expensive. But if the weren't making them, then all the money in the game couldn't magically create supply to spend it on. lvl 20 is about where I think it does start to become impractical and makes more sense to invest in other things


[13-Jun-24 02:38 PM] evany.#0000
i was just thinking the other day too i am surprised people aren't selling 'packages' for hq


[13-Jun-24 02:38 PM] evany.#0000
1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 etc


[13-Jun-24 02:38 PM] evany.#0000
i'd totally buy in personally.


[13-Jun-24 02:39 PM] evany.#0000
maybe its harder to do for last few levels but i can't imagine anyones mickey mousing trying to push 1 upgrade at a time for first little while. especially since some are so cheap


[13-Jun-24 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
unless you get pulled in by a strong group and get taught, I think most people do 1-5 one at a time


[13-Jun-24 02:40 PM] tanda#0000
I'm looking to 6-7 in one go, though


[13-Jun-24 02:41 PM] evany.#0000
i just did 2-8 in one go because it seemed silly but it took me several days to figure out what i needed


[13-Jun-24 02:41 PM] evany.#0000
would have happily paid a premium for a pack.

for the record the meme is sarcastic

🤨


[13-Jun-24 02:42 PM] flor2081#0000
its just easier


[13-Jun-24 02:42 PM] flor2081#0000
like, if you wanna make BBH, and you can't get enough AL from the CX because the price/supply sucks, you just make your own AL and BBH


[13-Jun-24 02:42 PM] flor2081#0000
and you're still getting good margins, so yay 😄


[13-Jun-24 02:43 PM] flor2081#0000
i'm not gonna stop my EPO production if CL prices suddenly go up, like idc


[13-Jun-24 02:43 PM] flor2081#0000
maybe you shouldnt take financial advice from me though, i've made some bad money decicions in this game hahah


[13-Jun-24 02:45 PM] acramernc#0000
considering opportunity cost has the potential to earn you more money, but there are valid goals other than pure profit


[13-Jun-24 03:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean you could buy HAL from me and make your own CL


[13-Jun-24 03:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also why is it HAL -> 2NA + 1CL


[13-Jun-24 03:12 PM] flor2081#0000
i meant i do that already :p


[13-Jun-24 03:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That’s weird


[13-Jun-24 03:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oohhh lol


[13-Jun-24 03:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can’t read


[13-Jun-24 03:13 PM] flor2081#0000
which is why i dont care about the price 😄


[13-Jun-24 03:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think if some people here saw my internal pricing sheet they would give me weird looks


[13-Jun-24 03:13 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, that is weird. NA:CL is Salt/Halite


[13-Jun-24 03:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Exactly


[13-Jun-24 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Imma go complain


[13-Jun-24 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Unless the CL is CL_2 gas


[13-Jun-24 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Then it would make sense


[13-Jun-24 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But I don’t think CL is a gas


[13-Jun-24 03:15 PM] tanda#0000
I think it probably is, the H2O involved in the process heavily suggests electrolysis, which yields CL gas


[13-Jun-24 03:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also why aren’t gases compressible….


[13-Jun-24 03:15 PM] flor2081#0000
i assumed they're already pretty compressed


[13-Jun-24 03:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They should weigh a shit ton and take up no volume then


[13-Jun-24 03:16 PM] tanda#0000
just be glad it's not factorio and we aren't manufacturing storage containers to transport gases


[13-Jun-24 03:16 PM] flor2081#0000
or trains


[13-Jun-24 03:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol


[13-Jun-24 03:16 PM] flor2081#0000
man i always get killed by the trains


[13-Jun-24 03:16 PM] tanda#0000
I believe that is my only achievement in factorio


[13-Jun-24 03:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’ve never played factorio


[13-Jun-24 03:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Nothing


[15-Jun-24 01:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[15-Jun-24 01:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well you are in luck because AL jumped way up recently


[15-Jun-24 01:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
A month ago I'd say it was the bottom of the barrel start

[15-Jun-24 01:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
At least till you become more established


[15-Jun-24 01:37 PM] boog.wav#0000
okay thank you


[15-Jun-24 01:38 PM] boog.wav#0000
um when making prod orders for the extractor is it worth it to just set it to max and let it go


[15-Jun-24 01:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Ideally you'd place the minimum orders. There is no benefit from waiting


[15-Jun-24 01:39 PM] igfloz#0000
I just do 1 at a time


[15-Jun-24 01:39 PM] boog.wav#0000
okay


[15-Jun-24 01:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It might be more convenient if you are away for a while though

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Jun-24 01:40 PM] jvaler#0000
i wouldn't, because then that ALO will be stuck in limbo unable to feed your SME for x days. if you don't have PRO license i'd do ~1 day long buffers, that way you can just log in every day and refill your queue


[15-Jun-24 01:40 PM] flor2081#0000
only reason to increase it is if your queue slots aren't enough: say for example you have 10 COL and only 5 queue slots, you'll want to stagger your orders so that they'll still run even when you're offline

aint no way


[16-Jun-24 03:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think they did a vyper


[16-Jun-24 03:24 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah but only 1 base


[16-Jun-24 03:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Or wyper, can't remember name


[16-Jun-24 03:24 PM] flor2081#0000
wyper yeah


[16-Jun-24 03:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They probably quit the game and deconstructed their bases


[16-Jun-24 03:25 PM] flor2081#0000
i dont think so, global chat only has records of him joining and coliqing prom&montem


[16-Jun-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
thats a lot of deducation to make so much DW with 1 base hahah


[16-Jun-24 03:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They flipped the DW


[16-Jun-24 03:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They bought my order


[16-Jun-24 03:26 PM] flor2081#0000
oh wait thats actually them?


[16-Jun-24 03:27 PM] flor2081#0000
i thought that was just a random order


[16-Jun-24 03:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yes


[16-Jun-24 03:27 PM] tanda#0000
where did one single base non-pro player come up with 25mil to flip DW on the opposite side of the galaxy


[16-Jun-24 03:27 PM] akyantor#0000
Trying to move the price up?


[16-Jun-24 03:27 PM] flor2081#0000

[16-Jun-24 03:28 PM] flor2081#0000
no not that guy


[16-Jun-24 03:28 PM] flor2081#0000
i guess he's just been grinding his 1 base for 2 years hahah


[16-Jun-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
They were waiting for their big moment to move the market. The long game.


[16-Jun-24 03:29 PM] tanda#0000
okay, but why ANT, lol


[16-Jun-24 03:29 PM] flor2081#0000
it's not like it's gonna have much impact anyways


[16-Jun-24 03:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We're talking about it now, maybe that's worth it


[16-Jun-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
It's a liquid (pardon the pun) market for a common good. Seems almost impossible to move the price longer term.


[16-Jun-24 03:30 PM] flor2081#0000
hahah yeah i guess


[16-Jun-24 03:30 PM] tanda#0000
I got a free ship for a few days, maybe I should just yeet myself over to Hortus and grab a few loads of DW


[16-Jun-24 03:31 PM] flor2081#0000
its only up to 90 aswell, thats still better than a couple months ago


[16-Jun-24 03:33 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh wow, I just looked at Amp Partners - They on a bunch of planets, including ANT area


[16-Jun-24 03:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah I don't see myself getting on that many planets


[16-Jun-24 03:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have 5 bases and it's about as much as I am willing to manage


[16-Jun-24 03:35 PM] flor2081#0000
you can choose for yourself what kind of things you want though


[16-Jun-24 03:35 PM] flor2081#0000
i've got planets that need a ship there once a month


[16-Jun-24 03:36 PM] flor2081#0000
while others that need it once every 1-2 days


[16-Jun-24 03:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I didn't say you can't


[16-Jun-24 03:36 PM] igfloz#0000
mhm.. OK, that makes sense to me


[16-Jun-24 03:37 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd guess it depends on distribution of the planets too... more of a faff if they're all far apart than in a short distance from each other.


[16-Jun-24 03:38 PM] akyantor#0000
That said, feel like everyone has a cognative load that they want to have for number of planets.


[16-Jun-24 04:44 PM] jvaler#0000
they seem to only be in the official discord, you could ping them


[16-Jun-24 04:45 PM] jvaler#0000
never said a word though lol


[16-Jun-24 04:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm off to get some of that cheap Benten DW 😄

[16-Jun-24 05:38 PM] antisyntax#0000
@tanda how did I overpay you? From the C i just bought, or from a PO a week ago?


[16-Jun-24 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
from the C you just bought. Internal prices for you guys is 600 per unit


[16-Jun-24 05:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh ok 🤣 Thank you. I just saw the LM and saw a good rate 😛


[16-Jun-24 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
oh did you take that off the LM? lol


[16-Jun-24 05:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
yea 😛


[16-Jun-24 05:39 PM] antisyntax#0000
i forgot about internal prices. tbh i've kinda been slacking on PRUN for the past week


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] antisyntax#0000
i had big expansion plans then just kinda... checked in every now and then


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] antisyntax#0000
but yeah now i've got like 600 AL to ship on starters 🤣


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] tanda#0000
hey, sometimes you gotta chill for a minute


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] antisyntax#0000
that's what im worried about these plans


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] tanda#0000
toss me a contract for transport? I have an empty ship sitting at Deimos for ~24hours


[16-Jun-24 05:40 PM] antisyntax#0000
they will make me need to constantly ship stuff every day lol


[16-Jun-24 05:41 PM] antisyntax#0000
sure. how much can you carry?


[16-Jun-24 05:41 PM] antisyntax#0000
and what's the rate for ANT?


[16-Jun-24 05:41 PM] antisyntax#0000
although rn all i have left is 331 AL


[16-Jun-24 05:42 PM] tanda#0000
I can carry 1k AL in a go, so whatever you have to ship


[16-Jun-24 05:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
ok. cost?


[16-Jun-24 05:42 PM] tanda#0000
8/t?


[16-Jun-24 05:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
sounds good


[16-Jun-24 05:42 PM] antisyntax#0000
i guess i don't know going rates i've never done a shipping cont lol


[16-Jun-24 05:44 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not really versed on it myself. I think the public rate tends towards 10 per ton or m3, whichever is higher?


[16-Jun-24 05:44 PM] tanda#0000
I apparently messed up this HQ upgrade again, and need to get more SP


[16-Jun-24 05:44 PM] tanda#0000
man I am bad at this


[16-Jun-24 05:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
oof


[16-Jun-24 05:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
im just hoping my spreadsheet is right


[16-Jun-24 05:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
since im doing a huge expansion with loans


[16-Jun-24 05:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
going from 1 base to 3 in one go


[16-Jun-24 05:46 PM] tanda#0000
I can see why you might be stressing a bit on that. What additions do you have planned?


[16-Jun-24 05:46 PM] antisyntax#0000
Harmonia for FRMs and Nascent for ALO and C


[16-Jun-24 05:47 PM] tanda#0000
ah yeah, that's a good solid one


[16-Jun-24 05:47 PM] antisyntax#0000
basically takes care of my C and ALO needs for my SMEs on Deimos


[16-Jun-24 05:47 PM] antisyntax#0000
but im also needing to upgrade my ships to handle that so im not stressing over logistics


[16-Jun-24 05:47 PM] tanda#0000
not too bad, but you'll want to get a WCB when you can swing it. With a WCB I only have to do the Harmonia>Nascent>Deimos route once every 5 days


[16-Jun-24 05:47 PM] antisyntax#0000
yeah


[16-Jun-24 05:48 PM] antisyntax#0000
the parts for the buildings were like 800k (actually cheaper since i had some stock)


[16-Jun-24 05:48 PM] antisyntax#0000
but the two ship upgrades is like 1.5m


[16-Jun-24 05:48 PM] tanda#0000
if it makes you feel better, I did Harmonia>Nascent>Deimos>Nike before I upgraded any ship


[16-Jun-24 05:48 PM] antisyntax#0000
ouch


[16-Jun-24 05:48 PM] tanda#0000
but I did avoid picking up ALO on Nascent


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
y?


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] tanda#0000
it's doable is what I'm trying to say


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
but, like i said, i like to take week long breaks lol


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
can't do that if im constantly watching the ETA clocks


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] tanda#0000
just logistics overhead. It was cheaper and less stressful to buy from LM and CX on ALO


[16-Jun-24 05:49 PM] antisyntax#0000
ah


[16-Jun-24 05:50 PM] tanda#0000
if you do get built up too much, @ me here and we can arrange some shipments


[16-Jun-24 05:50 PM] antisyntax#0000
sounds like a plan


[16-Jun-24 07:21 PM] evany.#0000
i operate on deimos and nike as well, always doing trips so feel free to poke me as well as tanda. 🙂


[16-Jun-24 07:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[16-Jun-24 07:23 PM] evany.#0000
i just left with only 270/1000. I wonder how many of us are running like that kind of not optimally


[16-Jun-24 07:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[16-Jun-24 07:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
My daily AL prod=cons


[16-Jun-24 07:27 PM] evany.#0000
i don't break even at all. i produce maybe 1/3rd of what i need. thank tanda otherwise i'd be underwater in nike


[16-Jun-24 07:28 PM] evany.#0000
with prices the way things are i'd have probably just shut it down


[16-Jun-24 07:30 PM] evany.#0000

do not shut down Nike, lol


[16-Jun-24 07:48 PM] tanda#0000
AL prices make it look worse than it is, and I bet you haven't controlled for the price you've been buying AL from me at


[16-Jun-24 07:51 PM] tanda#0000
That's why I've been getting vocal about trying to pick up extra shipments. I've been trying to run ships optimally and it means a bunch of times the two ships are just sitting there


[16-Jun-24 08:00 PM] evany.#0000
For sure I was just saying I’ve considered it, I’ve kept it running cuz of you my good sir!


[16-Jun-24 08:01 PM] evany.#0000
Same I’ve been trying to look for contracts for shipping now too


[16-Jun-24 08:51 PM] antisyntax#0000

[16-Jun-24 08:53 PM] tanda#0000
I have nothing but fondness for my 4k monitor. Had it for years, longer than my pc could support the resolution


[16-Jun-24 08:55 PM] antisyntax#0000
was thinking of getting a 4K but with my budget and PC i figured i rather have FPS than resolution


[16-Jun-24 08:57 PM] antisyntax#0000
but the 2K checked my boxes so 🤷


[16-Jun-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
oh, it's a 1080p monitor with higher refresh rate?


[16-Jun-24 08:58 PM] antisyntax#0000
no its WQHD


[16-Jun-24 08:58 PM] antisyntax#0000
3440x1440


[16-Jun-24 08:59 PM] antisyntax#0000
so basically 2K but 21:9 instead of 16:9


[16-Jun-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
interesting


[16-Jun-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
I would have loved one of those about 4 years ago


[16-Jun-24 09:00 PM] tanda#0000
thankfully games have caught up and are much better on dynamic UI resolution

Still think it needs a bit of tuning maybe?


[17-Jun-24 03:38 PM] igfloz#0000

[17-Jun-24 03:57 PM] antisyntax#0000
Yeah, it helps if you tune it, and also that you don’t use a 50 foot display port cable if you’re running it at 2K ultra wide 165 Hz lol

the ship inventories are redundant as you just click the cargo on the FLT tile
you could put a `XIT REPAIRS_DEIMOS` tile there instead to keep track of repairs, or a `PLI` buffer to keep up with planetary affairs


[17-Jun-24 04:44 PM] antisyntax#0000
ooh thats nice. yeah i just use the inventories because its nicce to know what ship has what at a glance. it helps me figure out stuff, (and i don't have to open up buffers to drag and drop items)


[17-Jun-24 04:44 PM] antisyntax#0000
but ill give it a try


[17-Jun-24 04:45 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean once a ship is sent off it's inventory isn't changing until it reaches it's destination, and then you can use context clues of where it's located to remember what you put in it


[17-Jun-24 04:45 PM] antisyntax#0000
true


[17-Jun-24 04:46 PM] antisyntax#0000
also back to the monitor, sorry i just got it like 30 mins ago so im drooling over it, but...

these true darks are really good. i didn't realize how whitewashed and bright things were...
makes me scared to play some specific video games 😛


[17-Jun-24 04:47 PM] jvaler#0000
also i think you're missing out on the "unload" button by using `INV` tiles instead of `SHPI` buffers

[17-Jun-24 05:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
yes? you need to use a configurable hotkey first

[17-Jun-24 05:24 PM] antisyntax#0000
like i said, really crude lol


[17-Jun-24 05:25 PM] antisyntax#0000
but you basically just open wallpaper engine, Open Wallpaper, Open from URL

just make sure its not on livestream mode, and set up a 'hide desktop icons' keybind

its good for four bases (though ill probably throw something else in those fourth slots since i'll only have three bases for a while

[18-Jun-24 09:30 AM] acramernc#0000
you might want to consider removing the ship buffers and compressing the SFC into one column so you can put some XIT REPAIRS buffers in there


[18-Jun-24 09:31 AM] antisyntax#0000
ooh yeah, imma replace NOTS with XIT REPAIRS


[18-Jun-24 09:31 AM] antisyntax#0000

[18-Jun-24 09:36 AM] antisyntax#0000
i wish you could move a panel somewhere on the screen without having to re-split everything


[18-Jun-24 09:36 AM] antisyntax#0000
i'd love to have my FLT above my CONTS and REPAIRS


[18-Jun-24 09:36 AM] antisyntax#0000
and keep all the ship stuff together


[18-Jun-24 09:36 AM] antisyntax#0000
but i don't want to have to redraw it all


[18-Jun-24 09:37 AM] razenpok#0000
You can create new floating buffers and move your panels into them


[18-Jun-24 09:38 AM] antisyntax#0000
true, but you still need to unsplit and resplit things

share? i'd like to see hwo you pulled the data for current days remaining


[19-Jun-24 03:24 AM] razenpok#0000
I move things around a lot, so I'll just post formulas here

This sheet uses two additional sheets:
1. **fio.burn** - just `=IMPORTDATA("https://rest.fnar.net/csv/burn?apikey={API_KEY}&username={USERNAME}")` in A1
2. **fio.inv** - just `=IMPORTDATA("https://rest.fnar.net/csv/inventory?apikey={API_KEY}&username={USERNAME}")` in A1

The formulas in the main sheet:
1. `A5`: `=QUERY(fio.burn!B2:G, "SELECT Col3, Col4+Col5-Col6 WHERE Col1='ZV-307c' AND Col4+Col5-Col6>0 LABEL Col3 'Material', Col4+Col5-Col6 'Burn'")`
Explainer: from **fio.burn** sheet get all materials on `ZV-307c`, which have positive daily total of `DailyWorkforceConsumption + DailyOrderConsumption - DailyOrderProduction`. This is the materials with burn rate, and this formula automatically populates the rows below. 

2. `C6`: `=IFERROR(INDEX(QUERY(fio.inv!$A$2:$F, "SELECT SUM(Col6) WHERE (Col2='ZV-307c' OR Col2='ANT') AND Col5='"&A6&"'"), 2, 1), 0)`
Explainer: from **fio.inv** sheet get a sum of material count on `ZV-307c` and `ANT` for the material on the current row. If none available, this will produce an error, which will be caught by `IFERROR` and fallback to 0. This formula is manually extended down to 100 rows.

3. `D6` is just `=C6/B6`, manually extended down to 100 rows.

Do you know if there's a way to use aliases in queries? I want something like `let burn=Col4+Col5-Col6` to remove duplication


[19-Jun-24 06:55 AM] razenpok#0000
So it would be `=QUERY(fio.burn!B2:G, "SELECT Col3, burn WHERE Col1='ZV-307c' AND burn>0 LABEL Col3 'Material', burn 'Burn'")`

I don't supply H2O usually; I bring a H2O to Harmonia for people who need a little bit while they organise more for themselves. The price covers the fuel cost of bringing the H2O in.

Just run single inputs on INC until you have an issue where you have insufficient INC and a surplus of input burn material. Even if you are trying to buffer yourself against the current market, it's better to reach out to some of the market contacts in here than to start trying to run buildings that don't get the CoGC bonus


[20-Jun-24 06:35 AM] tanda#0000
first screenshot is an INC running single burn on Nascent, the second is an INC running single burn on Deimos. You'll notice that Deimos takes nearly 10 hours longer to run a cycle of C production. CoGC and 5th expert are very powerful and you're not going to get those bonuses on a hybrid base.

First screenshot is 10 SME and 5 INC (which just barely keeps up with demand), second shot is 15 SME

Even with the high cost of carbon right now, you're losing 3k a day to running those 5 INC because with the bonus from CoGC you can make more AL than C


[20-Jun-24 08:27 AM] jvaler#0000
AL is still high too


[20-Jun-24 09:29 AM] evany.#0000
I wonder how much of that is due to c being high so al has gone crazy


[20-Jun-24 09:34 AM] acramernc#0000
I think it's mostly a supply issue

[20-Jun-24 09:37 AM] acramernc#0000
now, the supply issues could be caused by the increase in c price


[20-Jun-24 10:03 AM] acramernc#0000
okay this chart is a mess, but notably the "profit" earned by a singe unit of C (4*AL - C) seems to increase proportionally to the increase in AL price rather than remaining constant as I would expect to see if the AL price increase was solely driven by the increase in C price

[20-Jun-24 10:04 AM] acramernc#0000
also interesting to note that the price for both jumped at the same time


[20-Jun-24 10:05 AM] acramernc#0000
looks a little bit like al started moving first


[20-Jun-24 10:05 AM] acramernc#0000
might have to mess with the data a bit more later


[20-Jun-24 10:12 AM] jvaler#0000
~~iirc the AL spike happened before C~~


[20-Jun-24 10:13 AM] jvaler#0000
oh wait no inst1nct has a graph for that :o


[20-Jun-24 10:13 AM] jvaler#0000
cool


[20-Jun-24 11:45 AM] flor2081#0000
I don't think AL spiked because C spiked, because then there should be more time between them right?

It looks like ALO.AI1 has had a spike around the same time as AL (may 10 ish), but I don’t know how many people are buying ore off the CX and smelting it


[20-Jun-24 12:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It was at this time I thought to remove my dependency on the CX

I do also want to point out that all of us love when new players take advantage of the internal market to fuel their expansion. If you need something, like cheaper C don't hesitate to go shopping in #internal-offers

[20-Jun-24 09:23 PM] tanda#0000
oh, okay!


[20-Jun-24 09:23 PM] qalten#0000
I'll definitely do that. My need for C atm is just to try and get a bit of profit room on making/selling AL, it's certainly not a long-term goal, but my initial direction. I'm finding it also profitable to be doing transport runs for the shipping contracts out of Antares II


[20-Jun-24 09:24 PM] tanda#0000
if you haven't applied for and spent your grant yet, a good first expansion would be a hybrid (yes I know I just said they're not great) Harmonia base to burn GRN on site to ship back


[20-Jun-24 09:24 PM] tanda#0000
then later you could split the Harmonia base to be just FRMs and put your INC elsewhere


[20-Jun-24 09:25 PM] qalten#0000
How does this work mechanically? Do I just reach out privately to the poster?


[20-Jun-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
you can @ people in the trading channel if you want to discuss further, but most of us are okay if you just shoot us a contract for how much you want at the listed price, then @ us to let us know to keep an eye out for it


[20-Jun-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
this last part is especially important when it comes to buying from jvaler, sidepipe, or CptColeslaw


[20-Jun-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
they have a lot of contracts going on, so you could get lost in the shuffle


[20-Jun-24 09:27 PM] qalten#0000
Ah, gotcha. Will definitely be trying that out soon, then 🙂


[20-Jun-24 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
good to hear it!


[20-Jun-24 09:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm pretty good about watching for open conts, but it never hurts to make sure :P


[20-Jun-24 09:31 PM] qalten#0000
I've also been thinking about this. Will definitely be applying in the near future, and that seems like a good way to leverage it


[21-Jun-24 03:24 AM] evany.#0000
i'd also add that my experience has been same benefit of internal market is massive 
and you typically have a good idea of how much your consuming every x days, so i usually just say when building out "hey i need x amount of this every y days." and that will tell you if you need to find a different supplier.

even if things aren't listed some older players tend to have stockpiles of things maybe that they were building or are building which can be a good opportunity to just ask in #trading

[21-Jun-24 05:06 PM] antisyntax#0000
its hard to compare it to something i don't know. like, do the game devs have HDR monitors? should i base the true colors off of HDR or SDR? idk 😛


[21-Jun-24 05:06 PM] jvaler#0000
pretty sure HDR shouldn't do that. but i have a hard time telling HDR from non-HDR myself so

upgrades are pretty linear, we can just prioritize doing LFABs, RFABs and AFABs


[21-Jun-24 10:40 PM] jvaler#0000
i've got afabs from CAAP that i can share
lfabs and rfabs are probably more important for HQ upgrades, as it'll be quite a while until most of the members here reach the afab stage


[21-Jun-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
I make a small but steady amount of lfabs that I’d be happy to contribute to the cause 😄

But on that note


[21-Jun-24 11:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m thinking about making RFABs and maybe AFABs on Aceland


[21-Jun-24 11:13 PM] evany.#0000
thats kind of what i'm gonna do. i'm going to try to compile a list and see how many of x we would need to get everyone to say something like level 15


[21-Jun-24 11:13 PM] evany.#0000
and then see if we have any inhouse producers of said components


[21-Jun-24 11:28 PM] jvaler#0000
u could run a google forms survey


[21-Jun-24 11:28 PM] jvaler#0000
if you make it i can post it & ping in #announcements

because 17 is as high as it goes right now. copy pasting input materials because i dont know of a csv dump

you have to go to level 50 not 17

Maybe I'll upgrade a bit to make multi permit bases


[22-Jun-24 12:24 PM] tanda#0000
I think I might cap out around 15 bases, there's just some multi-base projects I absolutely plan on doing

ooh, nice - Imma gonna need some of those 😛


[22-Jun-24 12:34 PM] tanda#0000
I've noticed that too, your supply is getting on the small side for the number of mouths we're all feeding

Yeah, I _only_ make about 1k a day 😄

i'm not even using my latest 4 permits yet


[22-Jun-24 12:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
It adds up between everyone - most people are buying 1-2k at a time


[22-Jun-24 12:43 PM] tanda#0000
that's actually why I just started buying off the CX. I'm pretty well set for income so I leave your supply to newer players


[22-Jun-24 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
I did think about putting an order size limit in place, but there’s not too many newer players buying right now so it hasn’t been an issue


[22-Jun-24 12:58 PM] tanda#0000
Considering the entire system relies heavily on the water from ISA, how about Thalassa?


[22-Jun-24 01:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Thalassa's good


[22-Jun-24 01:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm trying to think of another figure that isn't just Poseidon

that's what popped into my head, so I started googling


[22-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Could take the name literally and just say Sello


[22-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But it has no meaning


[22-Jun-24 01:02 PM] tanda#0000
to be fair, we operate in a sector of space that is mostly Antares 1-5

i also need to think about a volume hauler eventually if i start doing what im thinking about doing


[22-Jun-24 01:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d aim for an LCB first unless you’re hauling gases - they’re a cheaper to put together


[22-Jun-24 02:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you do, I’d sell you my leftover mats at a good price. I’ll be dismantling 15 FRMs

[22-Jun-24 02:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
Water fits best in an LCB iirc


[22-Jun-24 02:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
Because it’s about equal in weight and volume


[22-Jun-24 02:12 PM] evany.#0000
1200water a day in 1000 volume wcb means im screwed 😛


[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] tanda#0000
you might consider using Thalassa for that HYF base


[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep - Thalassa B and ISA would be good options for that


[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] tanda#0000

[22-Jun-24 02:32 PM] evany.#0000
there is lots of opportunity in the market but its tough to gauge what will sell and what won't


[22-Jun-24 02:32 PM] evany.#0000
like if you just focused on utility like off/sun/uts
it seems like most governors run their own supplies, so even if you do it well and cheap its unlikely they will shutdown their production and buy yours


[22-Jun-24 02:33 PM] evany.#0000
so it seems the safe things are consumables like metals and elements plastics


[22-Jun-24 02:33 PM] tanda#0000

[22-Jun-24 02:35 PM] igfloz#0000
I think that what I ran into early game. I'd heard the agri was a "good" start, but my starting products took 10 - 15 days to get a nibble, let alone getting snapped up, even when I listed them with good prices, Seems many people are self feeding, rather than feeding the machine


[22-Jun-24 03:11 PM] evany.#0000
Yeah good point, it might make sense on paper but the reality might not flesh out too well


[22-Jun-24 03:12 PM] evany.#0000
And it’s a lot to ask to spin up a few mil in base to “try”


[22-Jun-24 03:15 PM] flor2081#0000
when people say agri is a good start they mean making your own agri -> RATs


[22-Jun-24 03:16 PM] flor2081#0000
because yeah at higher volumes you just make your own agri and don't buy from the cx


[22-Jun-24 03:18 PM] igfloz#0000
Funny you say that, that's how I started. RATs would maybe get a nibble every 7 days, so I regressed and tried selling raw mats (VEG, BEA, etc.) - that was even worse, lol


[22-Jun-24 03:18 PM] flor2081#0000
hahah


[22-Jun-24 03:18 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah i did some weird things in the start too


[22-Jun-24 03:19 PM] flor2081#0000

[22-Jun-24 03:28 PM] flor2081#0000
i started as carbon farmer, and then somehow I thought it's smarter to use my FRMs to make HER, and so eventually I was buying agri products to make C, and buying DDT to make her->fim->mea


[22-Jun-24 03:28 PM] flor2081#0000
which confused other people when i asked them for advice lol

Damn, yeah ! Now that I know a little better, that is confusing


[22-Jun-24 03:32 PM] flor2081#0000

Yeah but we only get one vote per person


[22-Jun-24 06:44 PM] evany.#0000
there has to be 9s of us. maybe?

I don't even know the first thing about being a governor, lol


[22-Jun-24 06:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Pretty simple stuff


[22-Jun-24 06:47 PM] evany.#0000
if anything like modern world, the best person to do the job is the one that doesn't want the job

Working on a more concise planetary management screen, what does everyone think?

4k resolution


[22-Jun-24 06:52 PM] tanda#0000
I do like how much space that ultra wide monitor gives. Maybe I'll look at changing my monitor. It's 4k but is literaly older than my computer


[22-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
ah


[22-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
i will have to revisist mine too when i add another planet


[22-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
i miss the production lines but i only rarely check them anyway.


[22-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
not really valuable information there. only check them if im around for a few minutes and gonna send a ship home before goingo to bed or something.


[23-Jun-24 12:46 PM] evany.#0000
when should i repair my buildings?


[23-Jun-24 12:46 PM] evany.#0000
one of mine is at 75%


[23-Jun-24 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
The rule of thumb is 90 days, but I think there's a spreadsheet out there that will help you find an optimal time to repair

[23-Jun-24 05:44 PM] evany.#0000
thanks!


[23-Jun-24 05:44 PM] evany.#0000
i think i now see the benefit of just keeping spare materials for repairs at random bases


[23-Jun-24 05:45 PM] jvaler#0000
100%


[23-Jun-24 05:45 PM] jvaler#0000
i've started pre-emptively stocking next cycle's repair mats at my bases now


[23-Jun-24 05:47 PM] jvaler#0000
that way my ships don't need to make a dedicated trip to take mats out there in time, they can just top them up whenever there's spare room in an input import


[23-Jun-24 06:07 PM] tanda#0000
that's an amazing idea and well worth maintaining a warehouse on any given planet


[23-Jun-24 06:28 PM] evany.#0000
i really wish there was a way to set 'auto-shipments' and balancing


[23-Jun-24 06:29 PM] evany.#0000
its weird that i have to spreadsheet out just how much of something i need to bring all my bases up to 15 days of consumables or something


[23-Jun-24 06:29 PM] evany.#0000
i should really have some sort of fulfillment option thats like 'fill the ship based on bringing it up to 15days' and it does all the math itself rather than me messing with windows calculator


[23-Jun-24 06:32 PM] jvaler#0000
do you use PMMG? the input-equation-thingy feature might be useful to you


[23-Jun-24 06:33 PM] tanda#0000
hmm? I use PMMG mostly for xit burn, what's that?


[23-Jun-24 06:34 PM] evany.#0000
i do - whats input equation thingy?


[23-Jun-24 06:35 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't know what to call it lol sry. it's the thing where you can put in a math equation, hit enter, and it solves it for you all within the input field

[23-Jun-24 06:35 PM] evany.#0000
because something that that let me keep say 10% of my buildings materials on the planet would be nice...


[23-Jun-24 06:35 PM] evany.#0000
what the mashit is that


[23-Jun-24 06:36 PM] jvaler#0000
so what i do when restocking is open the workforce buffer to get a list of daily burns, then multiply them by how many days i want

[23-Jun-24 06:37 PM] evany.#0000
dont you end up doing that everytime


[23-Jun-24 06:37 PM] evany.#0000
like contract basically ?


[23-Jun-24 06:37 PM] tanda#0000
I wonder if the action packages support lookups and math?


[23-Jun-24 06:37 PM] jvaler#0000
you'd be doing it every time regardless, you always have to use transfer buffers to move items


[23-Jun-24 06:38 PM] evany.#0000
i just drag and drop however much my spreadsheet says to drag


[23-Jun-24 06:38 PM] evany.#0000
its just weird to have such a simple thing not applicable ingame


[23-Jun-24 06:38 PM] jvaler#0000
... you drag in stacks of 1/10/100/1000 multiple times instead of just using the "AMT" option?


[23-Jun-24 06:38 PM] evany.#0000
uslaly 100 now


[23-Jun-24 06:38 PM] evany.#0000
but yes


[23-Jun-24 06:39 PM] evany.#0000
"i need 60 kom" "100 it is!"


[23-Jun-24 06:39 PM] evany.#0000
and just forget about it


[23-Jun-24 06:39 PM] jvaler#0000
oh you overshoot on purpose


[23-Jun-24 06:39 PM] jvaler#0000
~~evil...~~


[23-Jun-24 06:39 PM] evany.#0000
not gonna mess around with 10 here 40 there etc lol


[23-Jun-24 06:40 PM] jvaler#0000
it adds up over time to make more mental load imo. you'd have to keep up with making sure each different consumable is stocked, whereas all i have to do is look at any consumable and know whether they all need to be restocked at the same time or not


[23-Jun-24 06:40 PM] evany.#0000
i mean i would set it up if i had a transfer thing that i could say 'preload for zv759c" and it would look at what i have and load that from antares into the ship


[23-Jun-24 06:40 PM] evany.#0000
or just maxes out and i know i need a 2nd trip


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
at this point, I try to keep 20 days of supplies and resupply 10 days at a time. makes the math ezpz

[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] evany.#0000
same^


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] jvaler#0000
not same, you overshoot 😑


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] evany.#0000
i'm trying to break 10days but some things i still struggle with


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
But things inevitably drift and you have to top things off


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] tanda#0000
I usually stockpile up to 37 days


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] jvaler#0000
they shouldn't drift? mine don't...


[23-Jun-24 06:41 PM] tanda#0000
don't ask me why


[23-Jun-24 06:42 PM] evany.#0000
well yes i totally dont nickle and dime it for sure.


[23-Jun-24 06:42 PM] jvaler#0000
but now i want to


[23-Jun-24 06:42 PM] evany.#0000
two fortnights


[23-Jun-24 06:42 PM] evany.#0000
tanda thats genius


[23-Jun-24 06:43 PM] tanda#0000
well I figure that if I calculate all my stockpiles for an additional week on top of the month I want to supply, by the time they actually make it to the base, I'll have a month of supplies


[23-Jun-24 06:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have a few things like SCN where you use 8.4 / 10 days


[23-Jun-24 06:43 PM] evany.#0000
right but do you ship 84 or 100 😛


[23-Jun-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
simply stock for 50 days then 😼


[23-Jun-24 06:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
5 * 10 * x is too hard to do in my head 😞


[23-Jun-24 06:44 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why you let PMMG do it for you!


[23-Jun-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
i even do simple numbers like RAT & DW through PMMG input equations


[23-Jun-24 06:46 PM] evany.#0000
this would be perfect if i could set pre-selects like set deimos to 100 this 70 that 90 those and then just choose your deimos pre-select and hit transfer on the ship


[23-Jun-24 06:47 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[23-Jun-24 06:47 PM] jvaler#0000
what actually are action packages anyways? i haven't looked into them at all lmao


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
they let you buy pre-set amounts of stuff off the CX (with price limits I believe)


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] evany.#0000
oh thats kinda cool!


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
they only work with CXPOs?


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] evany.#0000
thats a prun thing?


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] evany.#0000
or pmmg thing


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
PMMG


[23-Jun-24 06:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
I hate to admit this but this is how I manage my entire empire at this point. that's why I only do the 10 day increments 😄

[23-Jun-24 06:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
For now, yes - i think you can either CX buy set amounts or amounts to resupply a given base to X days

[23-Jun-24 06:50 PM] evany.#0000
thats what determines how much i need


[23-Jun-24 06:50 PM] jvaler#0000
i did the same thing for a short while lmfao
but then i got too many bases to fit XIT BURN on one screen

but now i can do it again with the XIT BURN_ALL update!

[23-Jun-24 06:50 PM] jvaler#0000
just a quick scroll on my main screen and i can see where i need ships sent


[23-Jun-24 06:51 PM] evany.#0000
burn all eh that looks cool ill have to try that


[23-Jun-24 06:51 PM] evany.#0000
would be nice if we could get some persistence on the window i.e only show yellow/red


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
those settings are persistent


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
same with contracts actually


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
so are those...


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
everytime i reload the window they all select on again


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
or reboot pc


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
really?


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
chrome or firefox?


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
ill switch i give no fucks


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
chrome


[23-Jun-24 06:52 PM] evany.#0000
firefox..


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] jvaler#0000
contract filtering is a base game PRO license feature... i'd report that on the forums


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] jvaler#0000
don't think that's intended behavior


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
ill try chrome and then cry about it


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
im glad i whined a bit


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
hopefully your way works!


[23-Jun-24 06:53 PM] evany.#0000
thank you


[23-Jun-24 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
they should save states between sessions, and if you have one on each screen each screen's version should save independently of one another


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] jvaler#0000
wait which are you trying, XIT BURN_ALL or input equations?


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] evany.#0000
your way = chrome


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] jvaler#0000
ah lol


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] evany.#0000
xit burn individuals


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] evany.#0000
i want to try xitburn all


[23-Jun-24 06:55 PM] evany.#0000
i'm out of retail space on my screen now, so something will have to change when i deploy next base


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
do your CXOS settings also get reset every session?


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] evany.#0000
yes


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
damn that's annoying


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] evany.#0000
windows too


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] evany.#0000
i make a contract and always have to scroll just 1 line down to get access to the 'send to' person


[23-Jun-24 06:56 PM] evany.#0000
ill type the name and it will do the drop down off screen


[23-Jun-24 06:57 PM] evany.#0000
SO annoying.


[23-Jun-24 06:57 PM] jvaler#0000
oh that happens to me too


[23-Jun-24 06:57 PM] jvaler#0000
what you can do is start typing the person's name and it will scroll down for you


[23-Jun-24 06:58 PM] jvaler#0000
i never actually noticed that was an issue cause i naturally started doing that every time lmao


[23-Jun-24 06:58 PM] evany.#0000
that and rebuilding an existing cont - you have to put in all the things again even if your only adjusting say quantity


[23-Jun-24 06:58 PM] evany.#0000
kinda simple things that would be nice to see fixed


[23-Jun-24 06:58 PM] jvaler#0000
*that* is a known bug that's been around since the german translation update. everyone hates it


[23-Jun-24 06:58 PM] jvaler#0000
idk why it's not fixed yet


[23-Jun-24 06:59 PM] evany.#0000
its honestly my only real concern aobut the game in general, its a lot of fun but seems.. not too maintained


[23-Jun-24 06:59 PM] evany.#0000
especially for pretty penny


[23-Jun-24 06:59 PM] evany.#0000
i don't even spend 7$/mo on my eve subscription nevermind a browser game! hard sell that i hummed and hawed about for a few weeks


[23-Jun-24 07:01 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought eve costs like double what prun does?

[23-Jun-24 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
who even pays for EVE subs these days lol


[23-Jun-24 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
actual players can generally fund their subscription in game


[23-Jun-24 07:03 PM] jvaler#0000
oh that's a thing?


[23-Jun-24 07:03 PM] jvaler#0000
well surely someone's buying those subscriptions to be put into that economy right?


[23-Jun-24 07:04 PM] jvaler#0000
or does the game just let you convert ingame currency to subscription time directly...


[23-Jun-24 07:04 PM] jvaler#0000
that'd be ridiculous?


[23-Jun-24 07:04 PM] tanda#0000
the bots and multi-boxers, I believe


[23-Jun-24 07:04 PM] jvaler#0000
are what, buying the subscriptions?


[23-Jun-24 07:05 PM] evany.#0000
so basically i play kind of dumb


[23-Jun-24 07:05 PM] tanda#0000
that was always my assumption. I also know there's a bunch of poor people who sold the game time items to fund their in game habits


[23-Jun-24 07:05 PM] tanda#0000
I know, I was one of them back when I played


[23-Jun-24 07:05 PM] evany.#0000
i will buy the shit at 20% off in a package when they are doing a 30% off deal
then buy the plex for basically half price, then a few months later they run a "plex deal" to remove plex from the economy and iactivate for a year for 40% off 
i.e normally its like 20$/mo subscription

yeah but every faction has different Directors


[25-Jun-24 09:59 AM] flor2081#0000
the Space Analysis ones are usually not profitable, they're like the planetary surveys etc

you.... are correct


[26-Jun-24 11:30 PM] jcheung#0000

i assume that's cause the barrier to entry for ISA is much higher than something like boucher (insitor space's water planet). boucher is a triple green whereas ISA needs INS+HSE on all 35 RIGs


[26-Jun-24 11:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that do be what they do

More as their goal and not "the contract is on the way and I have free space"


[26-Jun-24 11:56 PM] jvaler#0000
that's darkfuel's whole thing. they're #1 in ships on LEAD


[26-Jun-24 11:56 PM] jvaler#0000
they're kinda stingey about their prices though


[26-Jun-24 11:57 PM] jvaler#0000
~25k for out of the way WCB export from resource extraction planets like nascent and SE-648b


[26-Jun-24 11:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
That's not that bad


[26-Jun-24 11:58 PM] jvaler#0000
you'll see i have 20k ads up right now that don't get picked up, but the 25k ones do very quickly


[26-Jun-24 11:58 PM] jvaler#0000
so 🤷‍♀️ lol


[26-Jun-24 11:58 PM] jvaler#0000
agreed


[26-Jun-24 11:58 PM] jvaler#0000
the convenience is amazing


[27-Jun-24 12:00 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
It'd be nice if new players could dedicate their 2 ships and make ~40k/day, but that would mean all 500t conts would be ~25,000$ (5000$ for fuel)


[27-Jun-24 12:01 AM] jvaler#0000
i draw the line at 25k for a SCB 😭


[27-Jun-24 12:01 AM] jvaler#0000
that's crazy

[27-Jun-24 12:02 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd do 10k, but i don't really post SCB ads. they're just less efficient when darkfuel has unlimited ships


[27-Jun-24 12:03 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I just post all of my ads in SCB increments


[27-Jun-24 12:03 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I didn't know that there was a magic number that darkfuel responds to and delivers your stuff


[27-Jun-24 12:04 AM] jvaler#0000
lmfao yeah


[27-Jun-24 12:05 AM] jvaler#0000
i found that out by trial and error


[27-Jun-24 12:05 AM] jvaler#0000
mainly due to desperation... i had a stint where none of my export ads were getting picked up so i just kept raising the price


[27-Jun-24 12:05 AM] jvaler#0000
then found out money really can bring you happiness


[27-Jun-24 12:05 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Post an ad for 24999 for fun


[27-Jun-24 12:05 AM] jvaler#0000
LMAO


[27-Jun-24 12:06 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
See if the darkfuel fairy delivers


[27-Jun-24 12:06 AM] jvaler#0000
imma do that rn


[27-Jun-24 12:06 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
If they pick it up, keep lowering it by 1

what he's trying to say is you might get to a point where you don't run your own ships

[27-Jun-24 06:13 AM] jvaler#0000
tip to make yourself more attentive to it is to mute big planets with new player spam, that way it's actually possible to catch up on new messages and clear the little green light. then the light can come on and you notice it


[27-Jun-24 06:13 AM] jvaler#0000
and also you can put a tiny COM(S?) tile in your screens to better see when you get a new message and from who/what


[27-Jun-24 08:57 AM] evany.#0000

trying to block out supply for you


[27-Jun-24 10:08 PM] evany.#0000
i currently use around 100 a day and produce around 70/day once things are ramped up 
but i have a lot of room to scale nike up - i just haven't because its really poor cash right now.  i will do some math and let you know

{Reactions}
👍 

[27-Jun-24 10:09 PM] tanda#0000
I am actually thinking about starting LFAB production in a month or two. I may have to look at stepping up additional SME space on Vulcan


[27-Jun-24 10:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
@tanda  (idk how to link the previous post) - are you planning for more chemicals in the future?


[27-Jun-24 10:38 PM] tanda#0000
yes, I am planning on moving my FLX manufacturing to Bober and splitting remaining capacity of that base between more CL manufacture and NS manufacture


[27-Jun-24 10:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
nice! CL and NS will probably never stop being in demand. and you can always use them yourself too 🙂


[27-Jun-24 10:39 PM] tanda#0000
I already knew CL was overpriced, but this posthttps://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/855496119713660949/1255968439709863997


[27-Jun-24 10:39 PM] tanda#0000
kinda proved I was on the right path more or less


[27-Jun-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you ever want to offload NS in bulk, let me know. I use a ton 🙂


[27-Jun-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, CL has been good money. Even previously at around ~3k it was a healthy profit


[27-Jun-24 10:40 PM] tanda#0000
it is absolutely nutty money right now. I've never made 800k per shipload before


[27-Jun-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's a nice feeling!


[27-Jun-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I have 0 idea what caused this spike in CL prices, it feels like it happened overnight. It was around 3k forever


[27-Jun-24 10:44 PM] tanda#0000
I've seen several more advanced players saying it is likely due to demand from AFAB production


[27-Jun-24 10:45 PM] tanda#0000
and I found it by looking into CL>TCL>KV, so I think they're right


[27-Jun-24 10:45 PM] tanda#0000
every step of that chain is an impressive amount of profit


[27-Jun-24 10:46 PM] tanda#0000
that and Hal expanding into HAL production was incredibly opportune


[27-Jun-24 10:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. EPO uses CL too, so I bet that's the reason. Buncha folks jumping into fabs. The order book was pretty thin, so I guess it makes sense that it would jump up


[27-Jun-24 10:46 PM] tanda#0000
CL as a material seems extremely permit hungry


[27-Jun-24 10:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
it is - I have 463 area for it on Grifffonstone and I make 40 a day


[27-Jun-24 10:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
and it's expensive to make because you can't sell the NA for anything 😄


[27-Jun-24 10:48 PM] tanda#0000
"Free to a good home" but at the end of the day it's worth 25 AIC


[27-Jun-24 10:48 PM] tanda#0000
I admit I was semi-reluctant to start CL production until I realized there was a NA Market MAker


[27-Jun-24 10:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you could make MED from it or paper for like OFF or something


[27-Jun-24 10:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so like NAB + some plant thing makes OFF


[27-Jun-24 10:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
this is with the 7 day average prices in prunplanner, but the COGM is like 1.6k if you allocate all the costs to CL


[27-Jun-24 10:54 PM] tanda#0000
that would be good. I just mean that NAB as it stands in game is always more expensive or slower than the alternatives


[27-Jun-24 10:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah that too


[27-Jun-24 10:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
IRL NAB can be used for hydrogen based fuels


[27-Jun-24 10:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but never made it far since recycling the resulting chemicals once burned was difficult


[27-Jun-24 10:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so I think it should be able to make SF like super efficiently


[27-Jun-24 10:57 PM] sidepipe#0000

i’m comfortable with whatever lol, i can’t get therapy and this is usually a good way for me to figure things out myself


[30-Jun-24 12:13 AM] avalock#0000
i was avlw to mentally image things when i was younger tho, i had a very vivid imagination (also lots of dysphoria i didn’t understand at the time) but over time it got weaker till basically i got nothing


[30-Jun-24 12:13 AM] avalock#0000
whenever i need to picture something i will draw it out typically


[30-Jun-24 12:14 AM] avalock#0000
i make diagrams a lot at work, i also suspect it hinders my verbal like communication because if i’m missing something to like draw on, i’m basically explaining what i can’t see sometimes lmao

[30-Jun-24 10:15 AM] avalock#0000

I spent a good bit of money on fortnite, but on the save the world version, not the battle royale


[30-Jun-24 10:17 AM] tanda#0000
good morning, I have arisen from the sleep of the dead


[30-Jun-24 10:18 AM] jvaler#0000
i kinda have the opposite problem
i'll spend more time trying to find the most value for my money than i spent getting that money
i'm just scared to make a bad purchase that i regret, but then i do nothing at all


[30-Jun-24 10:18 AM] avalock#0000
I got tricked into getting out of bed


[30-Jun-24 10:18 AM] jvaler#0000
omg yeah me too


[30-Jun-24 10:18 AM] jvaler#0000
like 100? 150? of what i spent was on STW. then they let it die 😭

[30-Jun-24 10:23 AM] jvaler#0000
imo smart isn't *knowing* something, but being able to *learn* something


[30-Jun-24 10:24 AM] jvaler#0000
you'll get the knowing eventually if you can keep up the learning


[30-Jun-24 10:24 AM] avalock#0000
yee, I mean I understand that like uhhh and I even say "everyone is smart in their own ways"

But idk I feel like if I said I was smart or something my ego would seem annoying


[30-Jun-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000
oh i get that
my parents constantly say i'm super smart when i haven't even done anything


[30-Jun-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm a lazy bum


[30-Jun-24 10:25 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I started HtB but never kept it up. There's just so many projects I can do and not enough hours in the day


[30-Jun-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000
test scores or whatever bla bla bla. i haven't proven anything


[30-Jun-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
My work ethic is very good, but my parents are the kind of people that will one up you, and like... it makes my ethic seem bad


[30-Jun-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
so i have a very toxic spiral in my head


[30-Jun-24 10:26 AM] jvaler#0000
oh ew


[30-Jun-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
I did like 47 hours this week


[30-Jun-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
and even then I still feel lazy


[30-Jun-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000
yeah, I'm doing my best to like... schedule things out


[30-Jun-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000
it's like work -> 1 hour HTB academy


[30-Jun-24 10:27 AM] jvaler#0000
D: 47hrs is a ton


[30-Jun-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000
Yeah, but I had the chance for like 50 lmfao

You do anything for organizing ? I found out that I love physical pocket books and they've been helping me remember and schedule stuff. You might like it too


[30-Jun-24 10:29 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
The physical feeling of scratching something out when you are done is awesome


[30-Jun-24 10:30 AM] avalock#0000
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hmmmm not really


[30-Jun-24 10:30 AM] avalock#0000
I mean I do a lot of note taking


[30-Jun-24 10:30 AM] avalock#0000

Your obsidian looks a lot fancier


[30-Jun-24 10:34 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
When I started mine, I didn't research any note taking techniques or any of the fancy named things productivity youtubers talk about. This means it's a mess now :(


[30-Jun-24 10:34 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe I should get on cleaning it up while it's summer


[30-Jun-24 10:34 AM] avalock#0000

I'm typing this from my linux PC


[30-Jun-24 10:42 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Do you use linux for stuff outside HTB ?


[30-Jun-24 10:42 AM] avalock#0000
I'm trying to use it as a main OS :3


[30-Jun-24 10:42 AM] avalock#0000
Just uhhhhh


[30-Jun-24 10:42 AM] avalock#0000
the process is slow


[30-Jun-24 10:43 AM] evany.#0000
So help me god if you say your trying to mainline arch


[30-Jun-24 10:43 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah it's understandable


[30-Jun-24 10:43 AM] avalock#0000

I started when there was only a few options and Slackware was kind of “cool”  in ‘96, in hindsight I would have had a much easier time if I used something stable like Debian


[30-Jun-24 10:47 AM] avalock#0000
yeah, idk I'm tired of windows BS, and just want to go to the walls


[30-Jun-24 10:47 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

[30-Jun-24 10:50 AM] avalock#0000
wwhere'd you learn stuff like this, I may want it for future use :3


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well more sleep isn’t more gooder. You need your REM cycles and you can interrupt them and wake up feeling tired


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well you are in luck because the next color scheme that I use to this day is SweetPastel https://github.com/sweetpastel

Well, it's not really light mode though


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Kind of ?


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think you'd need to swap out a couple colors


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] avalock#0000
fair fair


[30-Jun-24 10:51 AM] avalock#0000

Nice. I’ve experimented with Linux on the desktop a few times, but always needed the office suite for school. Since I don’t anymore, I think windows 10 is gonna be my last windows


[30-Jun-24 10:55 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
That is annoying


[30-Jun-24 10:56 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I left my windows drive inside so I can boot back into it if I need to


[30-Jun-24 10:56 AM] avalock#0000
my only thing is like... I need to still play wow cause I'm on a wow guild


[30-Jun-24 10:56 AM] avalock#0000
but


[30-Jun-24 10:56 AM] avalock#0000
if I can run wow in arch


[30-Jun-24 10:56 AM] avalock#0000
then I think I'm fine


[30-Jun-24 10:57 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Never played wow but I haven't had many issues with linux gaming in general


[30-Jun-24 10:57 AM] avalock#0000

that's just what they want you to believe


[30-Jun-24 11:00 AM] avalock#0000
but in general in vms i’ve been enjoying using linux quite a bit tbh


[30-Jun-24 11:00 AM] avalock#0000
sure its only kali but 🤷‍♀️


[30-Jun-24 11:01 AM] avalock#0000
which is different from arch


[30-Jun-24 11:01 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Distros aren't that different between each other, imo


[30-Jun-24 11:02 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
As long as the software you want is still packaged


[30-Jun-24 11:02 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[30-Jun-24 11:02 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
With some exceptions. NixOS is wacky


[30-Jun-24 11:02 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
In a good way


[30-Jun-24 11:03 AM] avalock#0000
we love wacky


[30-Jun-24 11:04 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I like the software but I found the community around it rather stuck up in the "philosophy" of it


[30-Jun-24 11:05 AM] avalock#0000
ahhh worm


[30-Jun-24 11:05 AM] avalock#0000
see philosophy is too big of a word for me

thoughts on rollercoaster tycoon?


[30-Jun-24 09:28 PM] avalock#0000
haven’t played it but seems good


[30-Jun-24 09:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The dev wrote it in assembly and I don't run code by mental asylum escapees, so I don't have an opinion on the gameplay


[30-Jun-24 09:37 PM] evany.#0000
One of the ogs


[30-Jun-24 09:38 PM] tanda#0000
I loved it when I was a child


[30-Jun-24 09:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s amazing that it was written in assembly


[30-Jun-24 09:39 PM] evany.#0000
most games at that time were


[30-Jun-24 09:39 PM] evany.#0000
especially on cartridges


[30-Jun-24 09:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Super efficient


[30-Jun-24 09:39 PM] evany.#0000
there is still C64 games being released


[30-Jun-24 09:40 PM] evany.#0000
infact most game "hacks" nowadays have at least some parts written in ASM


[30-Jun-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Wow


[30-Jun-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can barely code


[30-Jun-24 09:41 PM] evany.#0000
i used to do some basic ones - mostly cd check bypasses


[30-Jun-24 09:42 PM] evany.#0000
nothing more annoying then loading up a game of aoe2 joining the match and loading the game only to get hit with > insert cd when you remember you lent it to your buddy last night


[30-Jun-24 09:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Wow 🤯


[30-Jun-24 09:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would just download the key generator off the internet


[30-Jun-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
you could have a keygen all you wanted but you still had to keep the disc in your pc otherwise the game wouldnt load


[30-Jun-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
there would usually be a random dat file it would look for


[30-Jun-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
if it couldnt find the dat file it would tell you to insert the cd


[30-Jun-24 09:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ooh that’s what I did for zoo tycoon!


[30-Jun-24 09:45 PM] evany.#0000
had a buddy with 3 cdroms


[30-Jun-24 09:45 PM] evany.#0000
just so he didnt have to swap


[30-Jun-24 09:45 PM] evany.#0000
was considered crazy at the time


[30-Jun-24 09:45 PM] avalock#0000
all the cdroms


[30-Jun-24 09:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How do you make those DAT files?


[30-Jun-24 09:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Just get it off the CD?


[30-Jun-24 09:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I wanna play pajama Sam and Freddy fish


[30-Jun-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
well nowadays you wouldnt bother with any of that you'd just mount a mini that would emulate the inserted cdrom


[30-Jun-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
i wonder if gamecopyworld still exists


[30-Jun-24 09:49 PM] avalock#0000
i feel like theres a way, its how i was able to play Oregon trail


[30-Jun-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
oregon trail didn't have such copy protections


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] avalock#0000
oh whoops i’m dum


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] evany.#0000
first of all it was on a 3.5 floppy


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] evany.#0000
secondly copy protection was not a thing back then haha


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] avalock#0000
lmao


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] evany.#0000
yeah holy shit gamecopyworld is still alive


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] evany.#0000
looks as beautiful as the day i last used it too!


[30-Jun-24 09:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I’ve got the CD for those games


[30-Jun-24 09:51 PM] evany.#0000
if you still have a cd drive you could just copy it


[30-Jun-24 09:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000

It’s got a CD drive


[30-Jun-24 09:55 PM] evany.#0000
you could yeah though honestly i'd probably just download it nowadays if you have access to private trackers


[30-Jun-24 09:55 PM] evany.#0000
if its only on a cd at this point its not likely to be compatible with shit depending on the age


[30-Jun-24 09:55 PM] evany.#0000

White noise?


[30-Jun-24 10:56 PM] jvaler#0000
doesn't the "dont" at the beginning of the sentence carry over it's negation to the second half of the sentence? or am i bad at english


[30-Jun-24 10:56 PM] avalock#0000
idk lmao like uhhhh i slept between 3-7pm or something


[30-Jun-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think both ways can be interpreted


[30-Jun-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
English is ambiguous like that


[30-Jun-24 10:57 PM] jvaler#0000
amazing, what a wonderful language


[30-Jun-24 10:57 PM] evany.#0000
can be read both ways
in korean i'd agree with your interpertation, in english not so much


[30-Jun-24 10:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Clarity can be obtained by saying “don’t give up and then get on your phone”?


[30-Jun-24 10:58 PM] avalock#0000

[30-Jun-24 11:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Isn’t that in the “or something” part


[30-Jun-24 11:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or is that not how English works


[30-Jun-24 11:00 PM] jvaler#0000
only if you choose to believe it is


[30-Jun-24 11:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[30-Jun-24 11:01 PM] avalock#0000
yeah i like long form content


[30-Jun-24 11:01 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm mad they removed the feature to block all shorts


[30-Jun-24 11:01 PM] avalock#0000
same!


[30-Jun-24 11:01 PM] jvaler#0000
cause i'll see a single decent looking short on the home feed and then habitually start scrolling once it finishes


[30-Jun-24 11:01 PM] evany.#0000

[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] evany.#0000
my newest social media is facebook


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Let’s go watch reels on FB


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] evany.#0000

[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] jvaler#0000
is discord a social media?


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] avalock#0000
no its better i don’t explain here i’m sorry lmao


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] avalock#0000
ye


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yuh


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] evany.#0000
wat?


[30-Jun-24 11:03 PM] evany.#0000
is irc social media ?


[30-Jun-24 11:04 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i'm conflicted on it


[30-Jun-24 11:04 PM] avalock#0000
discord is more than an irc at this point lol


[30-Jun-24 11:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I didn’t ask 🫢


[30-Jun-24 11:04 PM] avalock#0000
sorry i’ll shush 😔


[30-Jun-24 11:04 PM] jvaler#0000
D:


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes sleep


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] jcheung#0000
because we can post images and files


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] avalock#0000
no


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] jcheung#0000
as well as talk


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm pretty sure discord counts as social media


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] evany.#0000
then whats just a communication platform?


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] evany.#0000
i can send images through irc too


[30-Jun-24 11:05 PM] avalock#0000
teamspeak mumble


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] jcheung#0000
no you can't


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] jcheung#0000
you can send links to images in irc 😛


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] evany.#0000
ctcp and dcc were both supported in irc


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] evany.#0000
no webserver required


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk what is “social media”


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] jvaler#0000
i think it edges the line because there's no interaction counter on every post. so that way the dopamine you get from socializing isn't based on abstracted numbers but instead real interactions


[30-Jun-24 11:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Is streaming social media?


[30-Jun-24 11:07 PM] jcheung#0000
...i guess i only used the lame ircs then


[30-Jun-24 11:07 PM] evany.#0000
i mean i guess i can see 'it depends how we use it'


[30-Jun-24 11:07 PM] avalock#0000
idk sometiems when i get reactions i get dopamine hits


[30-Jun-24 11:07 PM] evany.#0000
im sure theres a way to make it social-media like


[30-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
and maybe nowadays communications kind of blurred between social media


[30-Jun-24 11:08 PM] jvaler#0000
i guess, but chat is constantly moving so that messages don't stick around just to rack up reactions


[30-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
social media to me is mostly strangers and while i might not have hal's house address memorized yet for beers every other weekend


[30-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
i've never met half the people on something stupid like facebook


[30-Jun-24 11:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Slay the Princess Trailer
There's a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess.

You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.

She will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a doze...

[01-Jul-24 06:42 PM] avalock#0000

[01-Jul-24 06:42 PM] jvaler#0000

[01-Jul-24 06:42 PM] avalock#0000
I've also been lifting like 100+ lb subwoofers at work 🤣


[01-Jul-24 06:42 PM] jvaler#0000
if i wanna backtrack i can use the reply feature


[01-Jul-24 06:43 PM] avalock#0000
true true, idk I just uhhh worry like me talking too much stops people from wanting to talk


[01-Jul-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
you talking introduces more topics for people to talk to


[01-Jul-24 06:44 PM] jvaler#0000
idk about others but the #1 reason i don't enter conversations is cause the topic isn't relevant to me and i don't have input to provide. it's never about the person talking


[01-Jul-24 06:44 PM] avalock#0000
Fair, but what if people think I'm annoying 😢

[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
ummm i'm trying out the drawing pad i got for christmas... months later


[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] avalock#0000
ooo


[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm finding out i'm not very good


[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
My jeans need to


[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] avalock#0000
I'm positive you'll get better!


[01-Jul-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe
my pen control isn't very good and it feels awkward to move around the pad. maybe i need one of those hand sleeve things


[01-Jul-24 06:46 PM] jvaler#0000
i also don't know what to sketch lol


[01-Jul-24 06:46 PM] avalock#0000
🫂 You can do it friend,


[01-Jul-24 06:46 PM] avalock#0000
my fursona 🤣 (jk)


[01-Jul-24 06:46 PM] jvaler#0000
lolol


[01-Jul-24 06:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can but I *hate* working out. Need to turn it into a video game or something


[01-Jul-24 06:47 PM] avalock#0000
tbh, it really comes down to eating better when it comes to losing weight

The saying is like "Weight is lost in the kitchen, muscle is gained in the gym"


[01-Jul-24 06:48 PM] avalock#0000
*god I fucking hate that I said that, but like.... gymbros are right sometimes*


[01-Jul-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
wait that's actually true?


[01-Jul-24 06:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah


[01-Jul-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
cause all i want to do is lose weight, not gain muscle
~~i think muscles look gross, on top of worrying about looking more masc than i already do~~


[01-Jul-24 06:49 PM] avalock#0000
Like sure uhhh if you workout mucles, you can burn the fat thats around the muscle to get it more lean and stuff


[01-Jul-24 06:49 PM] avalock#0000
But uhhhh


[01-Jul-24 06:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Eating right is half the battle


[01-Jul-24 06:50 PM] avalock#0000
So like with that, I always hear transfems worrying about "I'm going to get too big if I workout" and that's really not the case


[01-Jul-24 06:50 PM] avalock#0000
Think of muscles when losing weight as like uhhhh


[01-Jul-24 06:50 PM] avalock#0000
your definition


[01-Jul-24 06:50 PM] avalock#0000
Like.... when you look at people who are skinny, there's people who are defined cause of the muscles


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] avalock#0000
and then people who aren't cause they haven't trained the muscles


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Muscles are the opposite of fat


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] avalock#0000
~~fit skinny vs unfit skinny~~


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can be skinny fat


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] jvaler#0000
i suppose
i still just don't like how muscles look lol
they're creepy in the same way veins are


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Me


[01-Jul-24 06:51 PM] avalock#0000
fair... I kinda just like


[01-Jul-24 06:52 PM] avalock#0000
I was gonna post leanbeefpatty but I shouldn't


[01-Jul-24 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
ik who that is, no need lol


[01-Jul-24 06:52 PM] avalock#0000
Like... if I was able to attain that, I would try


[01-Jul-24 06:52 PM] avalock#0000
and tbh I should try


[01-Jul-24 06:53 PM] avalock#0000
Oh also if you don't wanna like gain too much muscle body weight workouts are fine for that tbh


[01-Jul-24 06:53 PM] jvaler#0000
why's that?


[01-Jul-24 06:53 PM] avalock#0000
cause like... you aren't adding extra weight, and you can worry more about the mobility


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
So like for squats


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
I'm doing like uhhh


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
prob half squats mostly


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
But I'm working to full squat


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
OW NO


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
EUGH


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
Also not necessarily as focused on one muscle (depending on the exercise)


[01-Jul-24 06:54 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee that too


[01-Jul-24 06:55 PM] jvaler#0000
that point makes sense

hopefully this last bit goes quick, i really don’t want to be at work


[02-Jul-24 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
i learned that yesterday. ill let them out themself if they want but they are about an hour away from me. small world


[02-Jul-24 01:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
@evany. How good at Linux/ docker are you?


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] evany.#0000
i'm responsible for about 90 boxes. i've used a lot of docker and had to do a few composes in my time


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
🫢


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] evany.#0000
i do hate when people wrap databases in docker containers that aren't flatfile, though...


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk what that means


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But it sounds bad they shouldn’t do that


[02-Jul-24 01:32 PM] evany.#0000
eh it has good arguments for and against


[02-Jul-24 01:33 PM] evany.#0000
its probably marginally more secure, but interoperation becomes a pain if your exposing any API to say another department


[02-Jul-24 01:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
:MochiNod: I’m totally following


[02-Jul-24 01:34 PM] evany.#0000

[02-Jul-24 01:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Umm


[02-Jul-24 01:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have a docker server


[02-Jul-24 01:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Home lab fun times


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000
its a great place to learn


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah!


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000
and host things for fun with friends and such


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000
thats how my personal stuff started


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like MC server


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000
i had three racks in my house


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Satisfactory server 🫢


[02-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000

Sounds fancy


[02-Jul-24 01:36 PM] evany.#0000
it is not the fancy'est building - me and a buddy kind of built it


[02-Jul-24 01:36 PM] evany.#0000
definitely a little rough around some edges


[02-Jul-24 01:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho how do I make sure that a docker build is safe to run on me server so I can run a satisfactory server

for the most part depending on connection speed its only 2-5 minutes to 'test' it and if it doesnt work delete it


[02-Jul-24 01:40 PM] evany.#0000
you dont have to worry about having random config files stored in your operating system that potentially break things later


[02-Jul-24 01:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well


[02-Jul-24 01:41 PM] razesdark#0000
Lots of the steam based containers will fetch the game on launch


[02-Jul-24 01:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Uh I will be home in 4-5 hours


[02-Jul-24 01:41 PM] evany.#0000
all docker containers will have to


[02-Jul-24 01:41 PM] evany.#0000
no ones gonna ship a static container, breaks all the rules/benefits


[02-Jul-24 01:43 PM] evany.#0000
though it would be hilarious now that i think about it


[02-Jul-24 01:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
With my new apartment there are many things that I want to try out


[02-Jul-24 01:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I want to have a place for my smart devices that is separate from my other stuff


[02-Jul-24 01:47 PM] evany.#0000
i'd encourage you to probably consider a hypervisor


[02-Jul-24 01:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
:MochiNod:


[02-Jul-24 01:48 PM] evany.#0000
proxmox is probably the easiest/free one


[02-Jul-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
then you can stand up a vm for satisfactory and pause/shut it down and start something else (idk, ark for example) at the same time keep 'smart devices' on another machine


[02-Jul-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
i too am looking forward to getting home assistant setup later this year


[02-Jul-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
i've never used it before but i've never had the need


[02-Jul-24 01:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
What exactly is proxmox?


[02-Jul-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
a kvm based hypervisor that will allow you to spin up vms (sometimes referred to as 'guests') that are operating systems


[02-Jul-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
bsd linux windows, whatever you need


[02-Jul-24 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
it will look like this

[02-Jul-24 01:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Seems complicated 🥴


[02-Jul-24 01:56 PM] evany.#0000
it is _slightly_ more complicated


[02-Jul-24 01:56 PM] evany.#0000
since you seemed to have a bit of a grasp of docker


[02-Jul-24 01:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m using casaOS on Debian12


[02-Jul-24 01:56 PM] evany.#0000
think of it like docker but for operating systems where your dockerizing entire computers


[02-Jul-24 01:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So barely have a grasp on it


[02-Jul-24 01:58 PM] evany.#0000
it makes things a bit harder (you have to consider networking and hardware / cpu / memory) 
but you get the benefits of easy snapshots ( backups that are functional right away ) easy re-iterating "oh shit i broke that, guess ill roll back" on projects that might not be possible otherwise and just process optimization


[02-Jul-24 01:59 PM] evany.#0000
i.e you might lose interest in satisfactory and switch to factorio when the new dlc comes out- with a VM you just turn one off then turn on the other, technically doable via an OS as well but its 'containerized'  in a way


[02-Jul-24 01:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I've wanted to try self-hosting/a homelab but I can't actually justify it to myself :(. I don't really have a thing to use it for in mind other than maybe host my website there instead of Github Pages


[02-Jul-24 01:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Hm no


[02-Jul-24 01:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I don’t love factorio


[02-Jul-24 01:59 PM] evany.#0000
and someone else feel free to tell us to fuck off and we can switch to DM


[02-Jul-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[02-Jul-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[02-Jul-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[02-Jul-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A nerd


[02-Jul-24 02:00 PM] evany.#0000
we probably all are


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
self hosting only makes sense in a few situations, its why i no longer do it


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
probably not entirely true, i still have two nas's and four routers at home


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I think NAS always make sense


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
but its my literal lab while testing production changes and helps with work


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m trying to convince my wife to let me buy more hard drives for a bigger NAS


[02-Jul-24 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
my computer only has 1tb of disk so everything is on my nas's


[02-Jul-24 02:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
My wife needs more storage for photography job


[02-Jul-24 02:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But won’t let me get it for her in the form of a NAS


[02-Jul-24 02:02 PM] jcheung#0000
i should really get me a nas


[02-Jul-24 02:02 PM] jcheung#0000
my computer has been crashing a lot over the last two years


[02-Jul-24 02:03 PM] evany.#0000

[02-Jul-24 02:06 PM] evany.#0000

[02-Jul-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
i rent some space yeah, i mostly sell internet/network services though


[02-Jul-24 02:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk the difference but that’s cool


[02-Jul-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
small isps that sell cable services aren't big enough to deal with the big boys and so they come to someone more flexible affordable like me

[03-Jul-24 06:55 PM] jvaler#0000
what's the steel box?


[03-Jul-24 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
A factory held together by my shattered hopes and dreams along with a concerning amount of gorilla glue, duct tape, and 12 hour shifts.


[03-Jul-24 06:59 PM] jcheung#0000
plot twist: the box was a walk in refrigerator


[03-Jul-24 07:01 PM] avalock#0000
good!


[03-Jul-24 07:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Part of the factory is large enough to have its own climate inside so we do occasionally get a heatwave, coldwave or even rain.


[03-Jul-24 07:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
That and AC is honestly just whatever new hole is in the roof for cooling and the over 150 welding robots for heat.

I remember there was drama at the foundation but I haven't followed it for a while


[03-Jul-24 07:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

I used to use spacemacs a lot because of emacs org-mode. But I can’t have it on my work computer, and I don’t really need a planner for my personal life 😄

[04-Jul-24 02:37 PM] avalock#0000

kate may be more my speed maybe


[04-Jul-24 02:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Hot take here, but it’s not worth learning Vim if you don’t have to


[04-Jul-24 02:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
The keybinds are super nice once you get proficient with them (as are the regexes), but it takes a while to get there


[04-Jul-24 02:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
At least imo. You should use whatever works best for you 😄


[04-Jul-24 02:39 PM] avalock#0000
yeah, I'm figuring it out as I go lmao


[04-Jul-24 02:47 PM] avalock#0000
nvm found something better than .conf for discord


[04-Jul-24 02:47 PM] avalock#0000

[04-Jul-24 02:56 PM] avalock#0000
vencord actually


[04-Jul-24 02:57 PM] avalock#0000
I think the last thing I wanna try


[04-Jul-24 02:58 PM] avalock#0000
is dolphin transparent


[04-Jul-24 03:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh hey, they not only have the mod but a whole custom client, neat


[04-Jul-24 03:01 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[04-Jul-24 03:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I had issues with discord on wayland, I'll try it whenever the insatiable desire to try make Hyprland work on my PC is back


[04-Jul-24 03:02 PM] avalock#0000
lmao i was just having lots of issues with wayland


[04-Jul-24 03:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I really like wayland stuff. I think waybar is the best bar and Hyprland is the best window manager. The animations are just so good


[04-Jul-24 03:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But yeah, technical difficulties


[04-Jul-24 03:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Especially with Nvidia (🤮)


[04-Jul-24 03:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There was a really good screenshot I saw but didn't save. It was a page of x11 docs on some feature that only said "WIP (last edited 03/24/2014)"


[04-Jul-24 03:11 PM] avalock#0000
yeag my monitors couldnt show up in wayland


[04-Jul-24 03:18 PM] tanda#0000

[05-Jul-24 06:53 PM] tanda#0000
excellent. I'm already in need of AR, but I'll only pick up a little bit off the CX


[05-Jul-24 06:57 PM] avalock#0000
sounds good!


[05-Jul-24 06:57 PM] avalock#0000
We could set up an itinerary or something for like picking up AR and stuff


[06-Jul-24 08:50 AM] avalock#0000

[06-Jul-24 10:40 AM] avalock#0000

Ok question


[06-Jul-24 09:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How can I make an updating stock of how much HAL I have?


[06-Jul-24 09:10 PM] avalock#0000
hmmm, can you rip it from FIO?`


[06-Jul-24 09:11 PM] jcheung#0000

[06-Jul-24 09:12 PM] avalock#0000
hmmm


[06-Jul-24 09:12 PM] avalock#0000
I should learn how to do something like that


[06-Jul-24 09:12 PM] jcheung#0000
i start learning API stuff soon... so hopefully i'll be able to do more soon


[06-Jul-24 09:13 PM] jcheung#0000
though


[06-Jul-24 09:13 PM] jcheung#0000
i wonder if i could get FIO to dump its data into google sheets


[06-Jul-24 09:13 PM] jcheung#0000
🤔


[06-Jul-24 09:13 PM] avalock#0000
https://doc.fnar.net/ API documentation


[06-Jul-24 09:14 PM] jcheung#0000
looks like there's an app for that


[06-Jul-24 09:14 PM] avalock#0000
OH


[06-Jul-24 09:14 PM] jcheung#0000
🤔


[06-Jul-24 09:14 PM] avalock#0000
WE CAN USE CURL


[06-Jul-24 09:14 PM] avalock#0000
OF COURSE


[06-Jul-24 09:15 PM] jcheung#0000
what's curl


[06-Jul-24 09:15 PM] avalock#0000
curl grabs data :D


[06-Jul-24 09:15 PM] avalock#0000
from like websites


[06-Jul-24 09:15 PM] avalock#0000
and stuff


[06-Jul-24 09:22 PM] avalock#0000
ugh the data looks messy


[06-Jul-24 09:22 PM] avalock#0000
but you do get a text file


[06-Jul-24 09:22 PM] avalock#0000
I did like


[06-Jul-24 09:23 PM] avalock#0000
curl -X GET "https://rest.fnar.net/production/[Username]" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: [API key]" or you can get a much nicer looking file at uhhh


[06-Jul-24 09:23 PM] avalock#0000
./production/{username} on the website


[06-Jul-24 09:23 PM] avalock#0000
but its mostly CURL get commands


[06-Jul-24 09:26 PM] avalock#0000
ah i forget GREP commands but you could then like… GREP what you want from it


[06-Jul-24 09:27 PM] sidepipe#0000

We can be poor together - I put off restocking most of my bases over the holiday and now I gotta buy 15 days of supplies for some of them 😬


[07-Jul-24 10:08 AM] avalock#0000
You're probably a lot richer than me tho :D


[07-Jul-24 10:08 AM] avalock#0000
my revenue is like 965k


[07-Jul-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s not bad at all tbh


[07-Jul-24 10:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
My revenue is a bit higher than that, but my profit margin may actually be lower (as a %) since you’re focusing on mining


[07-Jul-24 10:10 AM] avalock#0000
Ahhhh fair yea


[07-Jul-24 10:10 AM] avalock#0000
my profit was like 700k


[07-Jul-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
My profit is just under 1M 😁


[07-Jul-24 10:11 AM] avalock#0000

[07-Jul-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
So you’re not that far off


[07-Jul-24 10:12 AM] avalock#0000
yeee, this new base should help with profits a bit


[07-Jul-24 10:12 AM] avalock#0000

[07-Jul-24 11:42 AM] jcheung#0000
Define pinched, and if it's easy why didn't he do it already 😂


[07-Jul-24 11:42 AM] avalock#0000

[07-Jul-24 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
I guess depending on where it is it coud be not too difficult. Might need to do some drywall work though which will be ugly


[07-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
the bent part is all outside the wall


[07-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
it's just too long is all


[07-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
so it folds on itself


[07-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000

Ah, learning osi?


[14-Jul-24 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
nah, Cisco certifications


[14-Jul-24 12:06 PM] evany.#0000
ah i see that now, but yeah thats what the ccna certification is testing for is knowledge of osi!


[14-Jul-24 12:09 PM] evany.#0000
i struggled with the subnetting originally until i read a nuggets book that made it 'click' for me bitwise is hard to do binary in your head (for me anyway) 
they taught a magic number trick that is the way i still do it in my head if i don't know it!

i'd encourage you to check that out if you get stuck there


[14-Jul-24 12:42 PM] avalock#0000
oooo personally i like uhhh count binary with my fingers sometimes awa


[14-Jul-24 12:43 PM] avalock#0000
subnet masking is one i have a bit of like trouble with but


[14-Jul-24 12:43 PM] avalock#0000
i’ll figure something:3


[14-Jul-24 12:45 PM] avalock#0000
the thing that was magical for me with linux was learning chmod perms were octal


[14-Jul-24 12:47 PM] evany.#0000
im sure if we dug into the kernel its because its likely stored as a single byte


[14-Jul-24 12:47 PM] avalock#0000
ohhhhh okay that actually makes a lot of sense 🤣 i guess the OSI model is apart of more fields than hacking shtuff


[14-Jul-24 12:47 PM] evany.#0000
osi has nothing to do with hacking its to do with networking any kind of component


[14-Jul-24 12:48 PM] evany.#0000
if you look at even fundamental ML and CDN jobs you need to have deep understanding of individual components of OSI


[14-Jul-24 12:48 PM] evany.#0000
networking 101, if you will


[14-Jul-24 12:48 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[14-Jul-24 12:49 PM] avalock#0000
there’s also OSI shtuff in hacking


[14-Jul-24 12:49 PM] evany.#0000
sort of


[14-Jul-24 12:50 PM] evany.#0000
hacking is understanding the model well enough that you can create a situation where the event wasn't intended by the developer so of course understanding OSI is very valuable

[14-Jul-24 10:08 PM] jcheung#0000
so it's actually less of a scam than some of the ones i've seen which were negative


[14-Jul-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000
well the games doing its stupid i dont want to load shit, but usually i price fuel at 10$/unit


[14-Jul-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000

anyone know how to pie hole?


[15-Jul-24 12:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
that depends - is it actually on a pi? I have mine running in a vm on my server


[15-Jul-24 12:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no mine is on a container on my server


[15-Jul-24 12:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
then I might be able to help 😄


[15-Jul-24 12:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i don't really get how to set that ish up


[15-Jul-24 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
are you setting it up through docker?


[15-Jul-24 12:53 PM] evany.#0000
i dont know that i'd recommend running pihole in a container


[15-Jul-24 12:55 PM] evany.#0000
setting static addressing behind your nat in docker? kind of defeats the whole purpose.. unless your running fqdn inside your own domain so you'd have to setup static ns servers to then relay requests through your dynamically built container


[15-Jul-24 12:56 PM] evany.#0000
anyway.. whats the issue ?


[15-Jul-24 12:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well let me static ip first I guess


[15-Jul-24 01:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
why not?


[15-Jul-24 01:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
also remember I don't IT

I'm just setting up Pi-Hole bc reddit said to

{Reactions}
👀 

[15-Jul-24 01:07 PM] evany.#0000
what happens when your server reboots and docker pulls a new ip address internally? you have to statically configure network forwards in docker-compose ? then assign a static ip to the docker host ? 

then when you pull a new image / update the docker container/new version of pihole you have to re-set that all up again otherwise your routers going to point you at a 'bad host' 

theres ways around the issues.. just seems like running up the down side of the escalator


[15-Jul-24 01:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and youtube guy runs pihole on his CasaOS cointer ui thingy so here I am


[15-Jul-24 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i checked and it is a 'supported' method of pihole now apparently.


[15-Jul-24 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
just a bit odd. feel free to post questions here i can't join voice right now

[15-Jul-24 01:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and that 10.0.0.128 is the static IP I've set for my server


[15-Jul-24 01:11 PM] evany.#0000
good call on that.


[15-Jul-24 01:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so it should work?


[15-Jul-24 01:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
as long as i change the dns to point to pihole instead?


[15-Jul-24 01:13 PM] evany.#0000
Yep


[15-Jul-24 01:13 PM] evany.#0000
it would work before too, its just if it reboots it breaks so you'd have to go back in and change it everytime!


[15-Jul-24 01:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
gotcha!


[15-Jul-24 01:29 PM] avalock#0000
@evany. my work just gave me some google cert courses for free

[15-Jul-24 01:35 PM] evany.#0000
i'd be curious to hear your experience after


[15-Jul-24 01:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ok how do i find the static DNS of my PiHole?


[15-Jul-24 01:42 PM] evany.#0000
i would expect that to be in the pihole admin panel


[15-Jul-24 01:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
somewhere in here?

[15-Jul-24 04:13 PM] jcheung#0000
may be worth getting a higher level plan with more data, 1.25tb may be enough but it's less than i'm comfortable with

considering one game could be like a tenth of that

[15-Jul-24 05:57 PM] jcheung#0000
i would rather have after work rain


[15-Jul-24 05:57 PM] jcheung#0000
before work just means that you have to suffer the whole day with wet something


[15-Jul-24 05:57 PM] jcheung#0000
after work at least you can strip when you get home

After a nearly 12 hour shift I'd rather just go straight to sleep, if it were early rain I could've dried off and been paid for it.

Engine team were doing final tests one day (during a rain storm) while I was still on the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) - doors locked, engines run up to max chat (full thrust) - damn that plane wanted to jump the blocks. I was nervous.....plus the engines were drying the ground (sucking up the water) in front of the wings, really weird to see

well, yeah, I get that, and the plane was braked.......but still it was bouncing around as if it wanted to jump chocks (In my case, not video)


[18-Jul-24 05:46 PM] igfloz#0000
use tug to push back, to get chocks out 🙂


[18-Jul-24 05:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Lucky, it was always nearly impossible to get a tug without a big stink being thrown... so we had to just grab another chock and use it as a big ass hammer 😁

is anyone buying coffee for their pioneers? 0.5 consumption per day feels a bit too much, considering that coffee beans only grow in hydroponics with 22 units of water


[19-Jul-24 10:51 AM] jcheung#0000
it's worth


[19-Jul-24 10:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Most people will be buying it, not producing it, unless in big quantities.


[19-Jul-24 10:52 AM] jcheung#0000
also .5/d?


[19-Jul-24 10:52 AM] sidepipe#0000
COF is definitely worth it to both buy for your pioneers, and produce in larger quantities for sale (though I wouldn't try to make a small base just for your own consumption)


[19-Jul-24 10:52 AM] jcheung#0000
that's just for 100 PIO right?


[19-Jul-24 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Most commodities you'll buy from the cx, not make on your own, especially early on. I hope you aren't planning on hydro on phobos.

But yeah luxury consumables are almost always worth it.


[19-Jul-24 10:57 AM] jcheung#0000
if doing extraction, it straight means more income
if processing stuff into higher tier stuff, it means you get through it faster, saving you other consumables (and you have more goods ready to sell in a given time)


[19-Jul-24 10:58 AM] jcheung#0000

[19-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
the water isn't the main cost, the NS is. but it's still profitable to make, CAF run for 1100-1300/u on ANT


[19-Jul-24 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
unless you are making something very low value, adding luxury goods will yield more earnings than their cost. (and if your profits are so low that they don't, you probably shouldn't make that thing at all)

You can usually click the checkmark in prunner and see the daily profits go up - those do include the cost of the added COF

nothing wrong with having additional columns either
icons | weight / volume | value | item count

but in most contexts i don't care about the value of my inventory when i look at it and i typically don't care about weight/volume so it would be helpful for those to be toggleable just like xit burn's red/yellow/green/~

Hmm, finished up my natural expansions... Now I actually have to think about what my next base is gonna be


[21-Jul-24 06:28 PM] tanda#0000
any ideas what you might want?


[21-Jul-24 06:31 PM] .shiva.#0000
Not really, gonna have to dig through some production chains and get some ideas

If you are looking purely at money per day, EPO/CL might be good

[21-Jul-24 06:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would look into COGC and try to cover my expanses (reducing expanses = making money)


[21-Jul-24 06:38 PM] .shiva.#0000
Eh, covering inputs is only worth for stability


[21-Jul-24 06:38 PM] .shiva.#0000
Opportunity cost and all


[21-Jul-24 06:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We also have an HQ on Elon for chemistry


[21-Jul-24 06:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[22-Jul-24 01:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
They should add Coal / Oil into the game. So we can process it into Carbon in one step. Make it super rare only on planets with large quantities of water (plants/animals)


[22-Jul-24 01:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
Burning food to make carbon is crazy concept 👀

for the low low price of 650 EUR each you can add coal and oil 😁

[22-Jul-24 01:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
Even just capturing CO2 from atmosphere like mars is more productive then growing plants and then burning them 😅


[22-Jul-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
hmmm


[22-Jul-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
is it though


[22-Jul-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
because that's basically what plants do 😂


[22-Jul-24 01:41 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah but electricity infrastructure and water that plants need + time


[22-Jul-24 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
you're still going to need insane electrical infra for direct carbon capture


[22-Jul-24 01:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
I think it would be around the same as hydroponics route


[22-Jul-24 01:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
just more space efficient


[22-Jul-24 01:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
We do already have this machines (big fan walls) that collect C02


[22-Jul-24 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
cracking CO2 into C isn't free


[22-Jul-24 01:46 AM] jcheung#0000
although


[22-Jul-24 01:46 AM] marat_sh#0000
watering plants in space also not free 😅


[22-Jul-24 01:46 AM] jcheung#0000
i think i remember something about magnesium and CO2


[22-Jul-24 01:46 AM] jcheung#0000
google help me


[22-Jul-24 01:48 AM] jcheung#0000
okay. still an incredible energy intensive process though


[22-Jul-24 01:48 AM] jcheung#0000
because of how stable CO2 is


[22-Jul-24 01:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
alright even if going with plants route


[22-Jul-24 01:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
wood is a good source


[22-Jul-24 01:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
I assume HCP is something like wood?


[22-Jul-24 01:49 AM] jcheung#0000
or grass


[22-Jul-24 01:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
then it should give more C in comparison to other recipe


[22-Jul-24 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I wouldn't count on that, I don't think they actually honour most of those perks anymore.

{Reactions}
🤔 

[22-Jul-24 01:50 AM] jcheung#0000
iirc there's some grass types that are incredibly fast growing and great for capturing carbon... if they didn't rapidly release it within weeks after dying


[22-Jul-24 01:51 AM] jcheung#0000
i was saying that in jest mostly


[22-Jul-24 01:51 AM] jcheung#0000
uhm


[22-Jul-24 01:51 AM] jcheung#0000
i personally wouldn't put that much into prun unless i made 6 figures, and i very much don't


[22-Jul-24 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
I never received a Discord call with the devs (lol), never got anything added about being a "co-producer", never had a chance to design a commodity, in fact even after mentioning to them about it I was kinda blanked on it, I don't think I ever got a soundtrack or structure blueprints but maybe I missed an email or something, and none of the physical perks whatsoever but they aren't very forthcoming with any information about the process behind getting them though, I think the idea is they do it in batches of purchases but like, it's been almost 7 months now so who knows.


[22-Jul-24 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
So yeah I wouldn't recommend doing it for anything bar supporting them financially.


[22-Jul-24 01:55 AM] jcheung#0000

Nope, just the regular go talk to Martin and being told it is done in batches.

[22-Jul-24 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mainly purchased supercluster for the system and planet naming alongside the badge, and plus I really enjoyed PrUn so I wanted to support.


[22-Jul-24 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Development for PrUn's kinda weird in general, it was a one man show for a while with martin pitching in seemingly randomly but now there seems to be more people involved actively. They have a dedicated community manager but she only seems to exist for their other game, I guess, I don't really know the specifics.


[22-Jul-24 01:58 AM] jcheung#0000

[22-Jul-24 01:58 AM] jcheung#0000

Don't know much about it though besides the fact you apparently get "credits" from supporting PrUn towards it, so.. whatever that means.


[22-Jul-24 01:59 AM] jcheung#0000
i mean


[22-Jul-24 01:59 AM] jcheung#0000
prun is a little pay-to-playish


[22-Jul-24 01:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's an argument that's been had to death and back, but I still hold my opinion that it isn't.


[22-Jul-24 01:59 AM] jcheung#0000
i said ish


[22-Jul-24 02:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
I would say that HQ limit and 2 ships flying at the time is what gate keeps it from full free game


[22-Jul-24 02:00 AM] jcheung#0000
you can still interact with other people and get loans and shit, but because very few people are willing to give you help without a pro or basic license....


[22-Jul-24 02:00 AM] jcheung#0000
plus HQ limit...


[22-Jul-24 02:01 AM] jcheung#0000
basically player to player interaction is nearly zero, and you lose roughly 3/4 of the features


[22-Jul-24 02:01 AM] jcheung#0000
well


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe 2/3


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
You still get several months worth of gameplay out of it.


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Most games don't offer that.


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
And if it wasn't the way it was, there'd be basically no income for the game.


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] jcheung#0000
well


[22-Jul-24 02:02 AM] jcheung#0000
there's some things that don't have to be gated so hard


[22-Jul-24 02:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am not saying that it's a bad thing that to pay the game. It's just should be advertised as subscription game


[22-Jul-24 02:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
Can you pay for PRO upgrade your HQ and reduce it to BASIC and have HQ upgrade?


[22-Jul-24 02:04 AM] jcheung#0000
the HQ limit and ship-in-flight limit i'm okay with existing... but if we had access to either CONT or LM in a limited capacity (like max 5 active CONTs, or no CONT and only LM access)


[22-Jul-24 02:04 AM] jcheung#0000
this would go easily into "play with people free"


[22-Jul-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
instead of "struggle to play solo and sometimes see people on CX"


[22-Jul-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
yes


[22-Jul-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
but good luck feeding all the bases


[22-Jul-24 02:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
True


[22-Jul-24 02:06 AM] jcheung#0000
granted you have basic license if you do that so you can at least find a shipper and pay them a premium


[22-Jul-24 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you purchase pro to build up bases you can just upgrade the ships, lose pro, and use upgraded ships, iirc.


[22-Jul-24 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Two WCBs can comfortably do a good number of bases depending on how you spread them out.


[22-Jul-24 02:06 AM] marat_sh#0000
you can't post shipments with BASIC right?


[22-Jul-24 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can only accept contracts pretty sure.


[22-Jul-24 02:07 AM] jcheung#0000
accept only i think


[22-Jul-24 02:07 AM] marat_sh#0000
Don't get me wrong lvl 5 HQ will take a long while to build up and expand all bases for solo player So there is some gamplay for free


[22-Jul-24 02:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
after that it makes sense if you want to support game and continue playing


[22-Jul-24 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
"Some" gameplay is a bit misleading.


[22-Jul-24 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Reaching that point without any outside assistance would take a good few months.

That's how it was intended to be done, without handouts it'd be the exact same thing, even with player to player interaction outside of the CXes.


[22-Jul-24 02:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's a niche game and will definitely stay that way. people who want that kind of game will pay any money for it

You won't be using the local market anyway, since you are f2p, unless you decided on basic. But even then, you can still work around it with a singular purchase.

[22-Jul-24 02:24 AM] jcheung#0000
now obviously i wouldn't rely on the 11k/d one to save you much money


[22-Jul-24 02:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
that's what my looks like right now


[22-Jul-24 02:25 AM] jcheung#0000
sorry, i meant per building


[22-Jul-24 02:25 AM] jcheung#0000
now admittedly


[22-Jul-24 02:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
yeah per bulding 4k


[22-Jul-24 02:26 AM] jcheung#0000
you do have the ability to place 2 BMPs per PP2


[22-Jul-24 02:26 AM] jcheung#0000
but the feedstock is slightly lighter i think, let me double check that


[22-Jul-24 02:28 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah. logistic load is way down. that said, i guess you aren't at a point where that's a concern


[22-Jul-24 02:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
Not yet Yeah


[22-Jul-24 02:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
only PP2 worht it though


[22-Jul-24 02:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
with LDE


[22-Jul-24 02:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
but it's a bit expancive for me for now


[22-Jul-24 02:29 AM] marat_sh#0000
But yeah it's pretty profitable to go for PP2 instead of more BMPs AND with less load


[22-Jul-24 02:32 AM] jcheung#0000
give me a shout if you end up building a PP2. i'll start you with some AL and NL on the low end of CX price-unfortunately not much though

[24-Jul-24 09:41 PM] jvaler#0000
they increased the extension speed of inserters in FFF #419 so that burner inserters are able to pick up items off blue belts now


[24-Jul-24 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
that is an incredibly apt xkcd


[24-Jul-24 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
ikr


[24-Jul-24 11:29 PM] jcheung#0000
this was something that was needed for a long time


[24-Jul-24 11:29 PM] jcheung#0000
blue belts would fuck with any non-fast inserter


[25-Jul-24 12:55 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[25-Jul-24 12:56 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm just wondering how it will affect the stats of the rest of the inserters


[25-Jul-24 12:56 AM] jvaler#0000
or maybe throughput will be unaffected?


[25-Jul-24 12:56 AM] jvaler#0000
idk


[25-Jul-24 12:58 AM] jcheung#0000
throughput will be unaffected, power consumption will be slightly reduced


[25-Jul-24 12:58 AM] jcheung#0000
since the limiting factor for throughput was the belt not the inserter


[25-Jul-24 12:59 AM] jcheung#0000
although in some niche cases maybe you wouldn't need as many inserters? eh, i doubt this part


[25-Jul-24 12:59 AM] jvaler#0000
definitely not true for many beaconed builds


[25-Jul-24 12:59 AM] jcheung#0000
i think part of the change was an alteration to beacons anyways


[25-Jul-24 12:59 AM] jcheung#0000
so that should be fine


[25-Jul-24 01:00 AM] jcheung#0000
that said, for those high beacon builds... belt was still my limiter, usually, so maybe i just didn't use enough speed mods 😉


[25-Jul-24 01:01 AM] jvaler#0000
but there's also quality now


[25-Jul-24 01:01 AM] jvaler#0000
the crafting speeds get insane


[25-Jul-24 01:01 AM] jcheung#0000
that'll be interesting yeah


[25-Jul-24 01:02 AM] jvaler#0000
so i'm very confident there will still be cases where a single machine requires multiple inserters worth of throughput


[25-Jul-24 01:02 AM] jcheung#0000
anyhow, the issue with feeding was usually the time it took to wait for items to get in range of stack inserters, i solved by putting two stacks feeding a chest and then chest feeding high speed building x2


[25-Jul-24 01:02 AM] jcheung#0000
and if needed, third stack working off just a belt


[25-Jul-24 01:03 AM] jcheung#0000
well, multiple inserters worth of input isn't what i was talking about when i said belt was the limiter


[25-Jul-24 01:04 AM] jvaler#0000
when i said throughput i meant inserter throughput, what did you mean?


[25-Jul-24 01:04 AM] jcheung#0000
oh. uh. total factory throughput


[25-Jul-24 01:04 AM] jvaler#0000
oh lol


[25-Jul-24 01:04 AM] jcheung#0000
individual inserter throughput will probably go up slightly, yeah


[25-Jul-24 01:04 AM] jcheung#0000
but marginally so


[25-Jul-24 01:05 AM] jcheung#0000
it's good to be on the same page again 😬


[25-Jul-24 01:05 AM] jcheung#0000

[25-Jul-24 01:05 AM] jvaler#0000
inserter extension speed slightly buffed, 362% speed boost factory-wide!

the next biggest question is what are your thoughts on carbon farming


[25-Jul-24 04:31 AM] finestone#0000
Carbon will be my biggest expense


[25-Jul-24 04:32 AM] finestone#0000
well RAT first but then C


[25-Jul-24 04:32 AM] evany.#0000
how much C do you need


[25-Jul-24 04:33 AM] finestone#0000
at 10 SME roughly 18 per day


[25-Jul-24 04:33 AM] finestone#0000
and when experts cap out


[25-Jul-24 04:33 AM] finestone#0000
24 per day


[25-Jul-24 04:33 AM] finestone#0000
Btw all these calculations were based on 0 experts


[25-Jul-24 04:34 AM] finestone#0000
so that was MIN profit


[25-Jul-24 04:34 AM] finestone#0000
28% bonus once its been running for awhile really buffs up profits just fyi


[25-Jul-24 04:34 AM] evany.#0000
when time comes for you to purchase hit me up


[25-Jul-24 04:34 AM] evany.#0000
i produce a bit of C


[25-Jul-24 04:35 AM] finestone#0000
yeah batches of 100 maybe once a week would probably be the way to go maybe 50 starting out


[25-Jul-24 04:42 AM] evany.#0000
thats where #internal-offers will help you out, i dont officially offer C but Tanda does and maybe some others but ill match Tanda for sure! so feel free to hit us up.

i started producing it because of     market variance that my newb ass could not handle on my small bases!

Depending on the faction of your HQ’s location (find it in the PLI command of the planet your HQ is located on), it will grant you a bonus on your production efficiency in certain industries across all your bases:

Antares Initiative: 10% bonus on electronics
Castillo-Ito Mercantile: 10% bonus on manufacturing
Insitor Cooperative: 6% bonus on agriculture, 4% on food industries
NEO Charter Exploration: 4% bonus on metallurgy, 6% on construction
No faction: 4% bonus each on chemistry, fuel refining and resource extraction

Furthermore, this bonus is modified by the ratio of used base permits to available base permits. The lower this ratio is the higher the bonus. The bonus is calculated by the following formula:

no shit. today i learned


[25-Jul-24 06:13 AM] evany.#0000
maybe ill go settle a base somewhere to change my hq bonus


[25-Jul-24 06:13 AM] evany.#0000
NEO sounds nice.


[25-Jul-24 06:13 AM] evany.#0000
cast too


[25-Jul-24 08:00 AM] tanda#0000
or just get a base on Malahat once that project is open again


[25-Jul-24 08:01 AM] tanda#0000
the 10% extra electronics output is nice, even with the rented permit, I'm making like a half mil a week out there


[25-Jul-24 08:01 AM] tanda#0000
with zero logistics


[25-Jul-24 10:09 AM] evany.#0000
What project is that ?


[25-Jul-24 11:33 AM] tanda#0000
It looks like allocater fully closed it, but there was a recruitment project for malahat to make money from the Market makers for edc and idc


[25-Jul-24 12:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep, it’s closed for now since we filled up most of the ENG unemployment on Malahat


[25-Jul-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Malahat is the hottest planet in Antares space these days... Well Northern Antares at least.


[25-Jul-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
We're going hard to pump up those numbers though


[25-Jul-24 01:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Jul-24 03:43 PM] avalock#0000
if i can get a 3090 for 650 is that a good price


[25-Jul-24 03:44 PM] igfloz#0000
euros ?


[25-Jul-24 03:44 PM] avalock#0000
dollars


[25-Jul-24 03:44 PM] igfloz#0000
OH, I have no clue


[25-Jul-24 03:44 PM] avalock#0000
apparently it sells for 1-1.2k

leaves me with a 2070 on my hands


[25-Jul-24 03:45 PM] igfloz#0000
err, I'd push that the 30 series is better than the 20 series


[25-Jul-24 03:46 PM] igfloz#0000
but not by much I suppose

[25-Jul-24 03:48 PM] jvaler#0000
same 😭


[25-Jul-24 03:49 PM] jvaler#0000
prun lets me play a game without feeling like i'm wasting time


[25-Jul-24 03:49 PM] jvaler#0000
cause it runs in the background


[25-Jul-24 03:49 PM] avalock#0000
i mean the most intensive thing i might be doing soon is like… password cracking


[25-Jul-24 03:49 PM] jcheung#0000
3090? yes.... if it works right


[25-Jul-24 03:49 PM] igfloz#0000
so a 3090 gives a score of 26,777 vs a 2070 score of 16,166

[25-Jul-24 04:01 PM] avalock#0000

oh, so like a board just for work


[25-Jul-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
i'd be more inclined to trust it than some random fb ad 😄


[25-Jul-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
but yeah. that's a big upgrade, though the question is "do you need it"


[25-Jul-24 04:03 PM] igfloz#0000
for me, 650 for a 3090 (yes it is a GOOD price) - but errrr, maybe too good. I've heard of 30 series / 40 series being advertised and the hardware has been "fixed" to report correctly. But in reality , the card is actually a 1050 😦


[25-Jul-24 04:04 PM] jcheung#0000
right, hence all my questions-if it's at a place you both work you can drag their name through the mud


[25-Jul-24 04:04 PM] jcheung#0000
meanwhile if it's legit maybe they picked up a 40 series and just want to get rid it the old


[25-Jul-24 04:05 PM] igfloz#0000
..also a possible true


[25-Jul-24 04:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, i'd trust it if it was through work personally


[25-Jul-24 04:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm also actually running a 2070 and would love to upgrade, I just haven't been able to part with the money yet


[25-Jul-24 04:08 PM] jcheung#0000
i've been thinking about an upgrade myself


[25-Jul-24 04:08 PM] jcheung#0000
but i keep telling myself i'll just upgrade the whole system


[25-Jul-24 04:08 PM] jcheung#0000
and putting off the graphics upgrade


[25-Jul-24 04:08 PM] avalock#0000
i’m thinking of a second computer


[25-Jul-24 04:08 PM] jcheung#0000
hey, sounds like you have a good starting component to build around for computer 2 😄


[25-Jul-24 04:09 PM] avalock#0000
i’ve been looking at a 4090 recently 💀


[25-Jul-24 04:09 PM] igfloz#0000
I jumped from a 1060 to a 3060 a few years ago, I still haven't even considered selling the 1060


[25-Jul-24 04:10 PM] sidepipe#0000

i would love to make my old computer a lil server thingy


[25-Jul-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000

yes. select sell or buy before the rest of the form is generated

👏 

[26-Jul-24 12:00 PM] razenpok#0000
Great idea


[26-Jul-24 12:01 PM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah like a different command, so instead of `CXPO` it could be `CXPOB` or `CXPOS` or something


[26-Jul-24 12:02 PM] jvaler#0000
cause when you go to buy/sell something you basically never are buying and selling at the same time


[26-Jul-24 12:02 PM] jvaler#0000
wait no CX traders probably do that


[26-Jul-24 12:02 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[26-Jul-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
and on PMMG's side, once buy or sell is selected, a larger emphasis is placed on that portion, like reducing the opposite side to 2 lines and increasing the side you've selected

makes it visually obvious which one is the one you're interacting with


[26-Jul-24 12:04 PM] razenpok#0000
PMMG could just hide BUY/SELL button

I think you need to open up the BS buffer for the specific base to refresh it? not necessarily just the inventory


[27-Jul-24 01:21 PM] razenpok#0000
Probably WF buffer also?


[27-Jul-24 01:26 PM] razenpok#0000
... and open PROD buffer for this base as well just in case


[27-Jul-24 01:28 PM] evany.#0000
i had BS buffer open


[27-Jul-24 01:28 PM] evany.#0000
i opened WF and prod and refresh


[27-Jul-24 01:28 PM] evany.#0000
still shows the same


[27-Jul-24 01:29 PM] evany.#0000
INV too.

at least WF shows proper numbers!


[27-Jul-24 01:32 PM] razenpok#0000
Is it chrome?


[27-Jul-24 01:32 PM] evany.#0000
ff


[27-Jul-24 01:36 PM] razenpok#0000

[29-Jul-24 01:20 PM] jvaler#0000
the power strip it's plugged into is supposed to have a surge protector, but we just had a storm come over and i saw a big flash of light come from my desk


[29-Jul-24 01:20 PM] jvaler#0000
and now it won't turn on at all


[29-Jul-24 01:20 PM] jvaler#0000
fuck


[29-Jul-24 01:21 PM] evany.#0000
Oh wow, only plugin one thing at a time


[29-Jul-24 01:22 PM] evany.#0000
If it’s a laptop try running it on battery


[29-Jul-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
no it just won't turn on now lmao


[29-Jul-24 01:22 PM] evany.#0000
Technically your laptops switched power supply should die


[29-Jul-24 01:23 PM] jvaler#0000
is there supposed to be another way to turn it on? i only see 1 power button


[29-Jul-24 01:23 PM] evany.#0000
If you tried the obvious stuff


[29-Jul-24 01:24 PM] evany.#0000
Let’s backup, what kind of laptop ?


[29-Jul-24 01:25 PM] jvaler#0000
ASUS TUF Gaming A17 FA706


[29-Jul-24 02:36 PM] evany.#0000
unfortunately probably not worth trying to repair. still under warranty ?


[29-Jul-24 04:06 PM] jvaler#0000
i have no idea lol


[29-Jul-24 04:06 PM] jvaler#0000
but my brother is putting together parts for a desktop for me rn


[29-Jul-24 04:07 PM] jvaler#0000

Send conts to be accepted on mobile ofc


[29-Jul-24 04:44 PM] jvaler#0000
mobile 🚫🚫


[29-Jul-24 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Prun mobile is good for a mobile version but holy shit is it not doable for me.


[29-Jul-24 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Happy they bothered and put in the effort to make it actually pretty usable and good, but, that's just not a game I could tolerate on mobile.


[29-Jul-24 06:06 PM] jcheung#0000
"good" is arguable


[29-Jul-24 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
it's good for contracts and shipping, and that's it


[29-Jul-24 09:35 PM] jcheung#0000
good for receiving conts maybe


[29-Jul-24 09:35 PM] jcheung#0000
but sending shipping is hell


[29-Jul-24 09:36 PM] tanda#0000
maybe I've just gotten really used to it since I'm out of the house for 12 hours a day during the week


[29-Jul-24 09:36 PM] tanda#0000
the one thing I *won't* do is touch the CX on mobile


[29-Jul-24 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
if you want to change the fuel usage... it has a very high chance of sending you into your fuel tanks


[29-Jul-24 09:37 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I honestly just gave up on adjusting those. It's just YOLO so the ship isn't sitting still


[29-Jul-24 09:37 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, i've gotten to a point where i'll teamviewer into my desktop instead if i have the time


[29-Jul-24 09:40 PM] tanda#0000
oh man, I can't even imagine trying to do that on my phone with our cell service out here


[29-Jul-24 09:44 PM] jcheung#0000
fortunately i have the luxury of good cell service... usually


[29-Jul-24 09:44 PM] jcheung#0000
don't get me wrong, it's pretty miserable too


[29-Jul-24 09:44 PM] riseoffilth#0000
shit gurrrrrl. Yeah... some surge protectors are cheap. def worth getting rated ones


[29-Jul-24 09:44 PM] jcheung#0000
but less miserable than when i'm trying to dial in fuel usage and i physically can't get the slider over, or if i do it sends me to the gas tank


[29-Jul-24 09:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
its miserable for dialing in speeds (miserable on computer too, but not as bad)


[29-Jul-24 09:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
terrible for making conts, if "doable"


[29-Jul-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
keep in mind too, surge protectors need to be replaced! they can ony do their job a few times before they're garbage


[29-Jul-24 09:47 PM] jcheung#0000
just give me a porkchop plot 😦


[29-Jul-24 09:47 PM] jcheung#0000
also keep in mind that there's brands that lie to you too


[29-Jul-24 09:52 PM] jvaler#0000
well desktop isn't ready tonight soo


[29-Jul-24 09:52 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe tomorrow at the soonest


[29-Jul-24 09:53 PM] jvaler#0000
CBA to use mobile, sorry for everyone i have pending conts with lol 😬


[29-Jul-24 11:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Molp was nice enough to explain how they generated the galaxy and so I'm using something similar for a program/game I had in mind :)

Also I found out that apparently the number of FTL lanes is related to the size of the star. It was probably written down somewhere else but I have't heard about it before

nice. I have so many old salvaged electronics parts, lol. Some I've used, most I collect to turn into art ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[30-Jul-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
better than a landfill lol


[30-Jul-24 08:55 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I mainly just like taking things apart, lol


[30-Jul-24 09:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
technically, you should try and dispose of all electronics at a proper disposal site, not just a landfill or garbage. A staples or other electronics store tend to be drop off points


[30-Jul-24 09:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
there are valuable rare earth metals that can be recooped

400$ for that is really good imo


[30-Jul-24 09:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that doesn’t seem bad at all 🙂


[30-Jul-24 09:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Used enterprise laptops on eBay can be a good option as well


[30-Jul-24 09:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
But this seems like a better choice imo


[30-Jul-24 09:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
M.2 NVME SSD too, so you may be able to upgrade the storage down the road


[30-Jul-24 09:16 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i don't need anything really powerful cause it's for school. i'm gonna have a desktop for games now! there's some stuff in my steam library i couldn't really play on my laptop that i can now, like cyberpunk


[30-Jul-24 09:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s even more exciting 😄


[30-Jul-24 09:19 PM] sidepipe#0000

[30-Jul-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
hell yeah cyberpunk


[30-Jul-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
it was always good, people's expectations were just set too high


[30-Jul-24 09:28 PM] tanda#0000

plus side is i don't see any obvious damage from that pic, minus side is i don't see any obvious damage


[30-Jul-24 09:33 PM] jcheung#0000
i wonder if it's contained to somthing easy to fix


[30-Jul-24 09:34 PM] jcheung#0000
like maybe it fried a bms daughterboard or something (not sure if that laptop has one)


[30-Jul-24 09:41 PM] jvaler#0000
ehh i've seen release footage lol, especially on console. it was 100% a buggy mess. but they fixed the bugs so it's a good game now @sidepipe


[30-Jul-24 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe... i doubt we'll really look into it though cause the case is kinda falling apart lol


[30-Jul-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
honestly? yeah buggy mess. Still a good game on release that lasted me about 3 playthroughs


[30-Jul-24 09:48 PM] tanda#0000
I also happen to love Vampire the Masquerade:Bloodlines (a buggy mess that still requires fan patches to this day) and The Witcher (1) which at least had its fan patches rolled into the release on GoG


[30-Jul-24 09:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
Good to know, maybe I’ll have to pick it up finally 🙂


[30-Jul-24 09:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve just been playing Oxygen Not Included recently. I’ve never enjoyed air conditioning so much!


[30-Jul-24 09:52 PM] tanda#0000
I bought that and just could not get into it. And then I have 400 hours in Rimworld so I'm not sure what that says about me


[30-Jul-24 09:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
Have you ever put down a cooler in rimworld and thought “wow, I wish that was the entire game”?

Pigs eat everything and I had lots of dead raiders


[30-Jul-24 09:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
I realize it’s tame by rimworld standards, but it made me queasy 😬


[30-Jul-24 09:59 PM] tanda#0000
pigs and wargs. They are great garbage disposals


[30-Jul-24 09:59 PM] tanda#0000
and if you don't have them, the fires are always hungry


[30-Jul-24 09:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Anyway, ONI is a great machine building game attached to some colony stuff


[30-Jul-24 10:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it’s great if you enjoy that sort of thing


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve owned rimworld for 10 years now, which is terrifying


[30-Jul-24 10:06 PM] tanda#0000
I bought it back in early access, but I can't remember how long ago that was

i need to get back into ONI, been too long... they added so much


[30-Jul-24 10:22 PM] jcheung#0000
also you could try instead one of the super cold worlds


[30-Jul-24 10:22 PM] jcheung#0000
then you have the opposite problem, at least for a while


[30-Jul-24 10:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
That would be really cool, actually


[30-Jul-24 10:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I might do that. I just started a new game since I finally picked up the rocketry update uh way too late


[30-Jul-24 10:25 PM] finestone#0000
ONI and stellaris both good


[30-Jul-24 10:25 PM] finestone#0000

ONI is in my wish list on steam


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think you’d like it, based on your satisfactory world 😄


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol 😅


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] jcheung#0000
ONI can be good time


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] jcheung#0000
....can also be incredibly frustrating


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well


[30-Jul-24 10:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Is it multiplayer?


[30-Jul-24 10:29 PM] jcheung#0000
no


[30-Jul-24 10:29 PM] jcheung#0000
....at least not when i last played


[30-Jul-24 10:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well maybe I’ll give it a whirl


[30-Jul-24 10:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could stream it someday if you’re interested in seeing it. My builds are definitely not optimal though 😅


[30-Jul-24 10:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol


[30-Jul-24 10:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I will watch once I get my internet running again 🥺


[30-Jul-24 10:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Apparently I need a different modem than the one that came with my new apartment


[30-Jul-24 10:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve never had the apartment-provided modem work for me


[30-Jul-24 10:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
At the last place they’d sell you 300 Mb internet and give you a modem that could do 100 max


[30-Jul-24 10:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They’ve got some deal with the ISP


[30-Jul-24 10:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s “quick connect” 🥴


[30-Jul-24 10:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But my plan doesn’t quick connect 🤣


[30-Jul-24 10:51 PM] jcheung#0000
it's quick on their timeline


[30-Jul-24 10:51 PM] jcheung#0000
not yours


[30-Jul-24 10:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho it got shipped and arrived today but I didn’t have an account with the Amazon Hub at our apartment so who knows where that package is now 🥴


[30-Jul-24 11:02 PM] jcheung#0000
~~behind you~~


[30-Jul-24 11:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I wish 🥺


[30-Jul-24 11:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Amazon says it’s not in the hub thing


[30-Jul-24 11:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000

[31-Jul-24 08:05 AM] tanda#0000
No such thing


[31-Jul-24 08:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
You’re only bad at it if you’re not having fun!


[31-Jul-24 08:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
I have never played an Ironman game in my 500 hours of it because I’m also bad at the game 😁


[31-Jul-24 09:11 AM] avalock#0000
i am thoo!


[31-Jul-24 09:12 AM] avalock#0000
idk what i’m ever doing i just go ooo pretty map


[31-Jul-24 09:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s the right way to play every paradox game 🙂


[31-Jul-24 09:12 AM] jcheung#0000
I've never finished a stelly game...


[31-Jul-24 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
I think i have at least 500 hrs in it


[31-Jul-24 09:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I usually quit after the crisis


[31-Jul-24 09:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Either I know I’m gonna win, or I just lost 😁


[31-Jul-24 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
Most of my games i don't even make it to crisis


[31-Jul-24 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
Rather, i don't play to crisis


[31-Jul-24 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
Keep starting new games


[31-Jul-24 09:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
The early game rush is a ton of fun imo - the late game can be fun, but it can also be a long grind


[31-Jul-24 09:16 AM] jcheung#0000
After a while, managing 20-50 planets is a chore


[31-Jul-24 09:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
Definitely. I usually end up naming my planets things like “Mining 1”, “Forge 1”, “Research 1” etc just to keep track of it al


[31-Jul-24 09:21 AM] jcheung#0000
naming? heh


[31-Jul-24 09:21 AM] jcheung#0000
i should probably have made use of that


[31-Jul-24 09:22 AM] jcheung#0000
i also hated pvp so would always end up pve in multiplayer


[31-Jul-24 09:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
PvE is the best imo


[31-Jul-24 09:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t think I could stick with a PvP game. My friends all play better than me 😁


[31-Jul-24 09:26 AM] jcheung#0000
right?


[31-Jul-24 09:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I’ve been doing PvE co-op empires with friends against steadily increasing crisis levels and that’s been fun!


[31-Jul-24 09:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
Nothing like seeing the first 1.4M fleet power crisis fleet


[31-Jul-24 09:30 AM] jcheung#0000
😱


[31-Jul-24 09:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
(We didn’t win)


[31-Jul-24 09:31 AM] jcheung#0000
i've never personally had a fleet larger than half mil


[31-Jul-24 09:31 AM] jcheung#0000
and pretty sure the composition wasn't great


[31-Jul-24 09:32 AM] akyantor#0000
2nd vote for PvE co-op against increasing difficulty. That can be a lot of fun, albeit with a lot of miss steps 😛

We can even do like a clustered player start, where we're near each other


[31-Jul-24 06:31 PM] sidepipe#0000

Thanks. This next month is full of growth and good upgrades, and we can all take a deep breath and just get back to enjoying the game without big arguments. I'm hoping to finish writing up my ideas for some stuff thats been on my mind. I urge folks, if yall havent seen my spam across many channels yet, to join the UFO discord, go to the “Request Access” channel, and enter into the chat “!join antares regional-governance”. https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP

Harry Potter, and LOTR, were required, and assigned readings, when I was in grammar school. Two+ decades ago.


[04-Aug-24 03:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The other things, along the same horizontal lines as that, were popular culture, via games, TV shows, comics, et.c.


[04-Aug-24 03:22 PM] jvaler#0000
oh did your "----" mean LOTR?

Autism based on age.... My whole class cohort was dolled some of that posted pic content, via class assigned reading. Others were available via pop culture multi media... Cohorts (class groups) change like every 4-10 years..... So the joke, is..... Are the current things that kids are getting in class, these days, just AMOOGUS, and the like, or not?! **sorta question, sorta joke, sorta whatever**


[04-Aug-24 03:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

Tear the packaging apart between your hands, I
Don’t know what I’ll do and I’m not really sure I can, all the
Work that I’ve accomplished is to just promote a scam
I’ll keep pushing, pushing, pushing ’til I make something I can’t
I’m on mass production, please take me off the assembly line
Written on the box, a money-back guarant...

my main issue with that is it's not quite in the same vein as the games we've been discussing: it's a singleplayer only game compared to multiplayer

on the other hand, that looks cool I might play that


[04-Aug-24 07:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
what if it's a mix? basically single player, but you can invite your friends for multiplayer?

Starbound, Astroneer, are like that, since I've dunked numerous hours into them.

Apparently, whittling down your foes, by using cheap planes + bombs, does more work than the expensive stuff does.


[04-Aug-24 07:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep. Small cheap highly maneuverable ships too. It’s like risk mitigation - you can’t lose the Sevastopol if you never use it, and the 150mm rounds you dodge never hurt you 😄

Unless you have someone you know, who deals in RL metal-based manufacturing processes ( I do -- but that's besides the point  ); you gotta start with the basics, from historical methods.... https://www.youtube.com/@Clickspring/videos This channel, I think had some like, pure basic smithing methods uploaded... Idk if they've been deleted or not.

If you like that sort of stuff, you've eventually get to the modern CAD/CNC machining processes, that the small-timers run these days (niche, highly technical, and highly outsourced from your major manufacturers, who rely on the small guy, for their weekly just-in-time supply chain needs).


[04-Aug-24 07:47 PM] evany.#0000
anyway i agree, it would have been really cool to get taught how to work a real smithy


[04-Aug-24 07:47 PM] evany.#0000
i was jealous as shit of him!


[04-Aug-24 07:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Don't be jelly. The capital investment, for the equipment and inputs, for just a basic, circa ~middle-ages smithy, is huge... But beyond that, all that's needed is 1) a little bit of creativity, 2) hands-on-skill, and 3) a lot of muscle. The modern equivalents require more of #1, and a lot more of #2. Easy to learn, but generally inapplicable unless you can get your hand on the capital equipment that's required for such processes.


[04-Aug-24 07:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
These days... lets say you want to run a modern process, for some base raw material stock, through something automated. You're eyeballing anything between 100k --> 1mil, just to setup, in capital sinks, with marginal returns, since yeah #competition.


[04-Aug-24 07:58 PM] evany.#0000
i either dont recall or never learned the specifics. but he worked under a master armorer that restored pieces for a museum, i dont recall which


[04-Aug-24 07:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Very niche --- and a very nice job.


[04-Aug-24 07:59 PM] evany.#0000
yeah incredibly niche as you said not something very reasonable for most people


[04-Aug-24 07:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i was in a Smithy club at uni


[04-Aug-24 08:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You gotta sit close to some flame, which will burn all the hairs off of your face, arms, and hand, indefinitely... Then you gotta hammer stuff, until it cools down to some color, which you just return to the flame, and repeat.... Until you get the form you want ---- very hard work.


[04-Aug-24 08:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

No... Not mad cash money....


[04-Aug-24 08:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They just had friends, who sold them the capital investments, at rock bottom prices.


[04-Aug-24 08:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no we had literal millions


[04-Aug-24 08:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
grant money is nice


[04-Aug-24 08:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes.... But these days, such equipment is not needed? Most stuff gets rolled from sheet metal, which is delivered, in compressed rolls, straight from a forge business.


[04-Aug-24 08:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
we had a SLM 3D printer as well


[04-Aug-24 08:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Stuff then gets rolled, into some random, hollow form, gets welded, painted, and then sold to you!


[04-Aug-24 08:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or pressed.


[04-Aug-24 08:05 PM] tanda#0000

i was trying to use the camera to see if i could get the IR to show


[04-Aug-24 09:59 PM] avalock#0000
it would on the trackball light


[04-Aug-24 09:59 PM] avalock#0000
but on that light nothing even when like passing the screwdriver through to test


[04-Aug-24 10:00 PM] avalock#0000
i should get a multimeter…


[04-Aug-24 10:03 PM] avalock#0000
with tiny probe bits too… probably fluke

i had to replace the like screws on a DB25 connector because the manufacturer didnt send it with them, and i had to remove this like “hat” PCB for a networking port


[04-Aug-24 10:11 PM] avalock#0000
was fun


[04-Aug-24 10:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Significant understatement, right there.


[04-Aug-24 10:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
As far as screws... Well do you know that DB25 connector's dimensions? Common approximations can be easily made, if you know the product specifications..... But I wouldn't recommend driving a deck screw, into a PCB board, though.


[04-Aug-24 10:29 PM] avalock#0000
the vendor sent me the screws it wasn’t going into the PCB its the little ones you screw the DB25  male connectors onto


[04-Aug-24 10:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You may likely see these vendor mistakes, more often these days.... Misplacing a screw packet, into a product box, is rather easy, for those that don't differentiate between small screw -- size A, and size -- B.


[04-Aug-24 10:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Idk know what happens in your industry though... But be capable of adapting to a changing business environment? 🙂


[04-Aug-24 10:37 PM] avalock#0000

econ report for last month was dropped. Your I extractions need alot of scrolling to get to.

alright, I'll give it a look


[05-Aug-24 08:49 PM] tanda#0000
I definitely breezed by it


[05-Aug-24 08:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
As for demand? I can't speak of ~~who will buy it...


[05-Aug-24 08:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But...


[05-Aug-24 08:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Tally up your in-game [LEAD] production figures for ALG, and you will know who needs the MHLs.


[05-Aug-24 08:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Why ALG? It easily gives you a minimum figure of who does HYF for RATs. If you do HYF for CAF/HCP/other things, it's harder to tell with FRM recipe commonalities.


[05-Aug-24 08:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
With current prices for CLI, I is worth producing at 1400 AIC per item. I don't think people will be buying it that that price


[05-Aug-24 08:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
if you give CLI for free. It's worth producing at 750 AIC +


[05-Aug-24 08:52 PM] tanda#0000
I never intended to sell it as a finished product, but it's really hard to get a read on that market with 0 ASK offers available at ANT


[05-Aug-24 08:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
CLI --> @BMP --> I, rather trivial to spin something up, like MHL production, that needs a dependable source of I inputs.


[05-Aug-24 08:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Of course, then you have CLI as an issue...


[05-Aug-24 08:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
Compared to other BMP recipes, I is a bad item


[05-Aug-24 08:54 PM] tanda#0000
I just gotta make sure it's worth Avacyn's time before I ask for that favor, lol


[05-Aug-24 08:55 PM] tanda#0000
but it does help that CLI is on both Elon and Halcyon


[05-Aug-24 08:55 PM] tanda#0000
so there's good secondary minerals to extract at both locations


[05-Aug-24 08:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I is used for high output HYFs; buy orders come in every 45/90 days for MHLs. It is also used for VIT, but idk who buys it on the regular. LUX higher tier commodity input, for VG..


[05-Aug-24 08:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
If it's worth for you to buy I at 1400-1500 per item. Then it's worth producing CLI


[05-Aug-24 08:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, don't trust the metrics though.


[05-Aug-24 08:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Most of the I ---> MHL production, is largely internal. You see excess of the CLI/I/MHL outputs, that get posted on the CXs, at huge mark ups. Confirm with your suppliers, as to how low's their ppus are, if they would be willing to part with their stocks.


[05-Aug-24 08:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ it's better to produce I yourself at current market.


[05-Aug-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, that's the impression I was getting


[05-Aug-24 08:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
ye, I'll def keep it in mind, whenever I spin up something at Vulcan.


[05-Aug-24 08:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
+ I is very heavy


[05-Aug-24 09:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
eh, not so heavy, that I don't want to ship it (all I do is HYFs, so its a guilty pleasure? or a guaranteed burden? who knows these things)


[05-Aug-24 09:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
but shipping TI metal? yeah....


[05-Aug-24 09:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
Comparing to other BMP items it's heavy


[05-Aug-24 09:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
not touching that.


[05-Aug-24 09:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
4.93t per item


[05-Aug-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
it's not terrible, though. A full welding base can only use 30 per day


[05-Aug-24 09:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
who was I talking to earlier about I? I can provide I...


[05-Aug-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
so it's sharply limited by just how much a base can actually go through


[05-Aug-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
It wasn't me, lol. I just started thinking about this because I need MHL


[05-Aug-24 09:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
not me --- but I'll definitely be looking into some I, in a few months, or less.

[05-Aug-24 09:04 PM] avalock#0000
okay i’ll come mine HAL with you


[05-Aug-24 09:04 PM] avalock#0000
in a few weeks


[05-Aug-24 09:04 PM] tanda#0000
actually that's something I was looking at: CL production has apparently not gone up at all during the last economic report


[05-Aug-24 09:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
HAL - > CL -> TCL


[05-Aug-24 09:05 PM] tanda#0000
how much CLI could you process without burdening your supply lines?


[05-Aug-24 09:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ yes 😅 I've got 40 BMPs just making PE and OFF and whatever else I can keep them busy with


[05-Aug-24 09:07 PM] avalock#0000
i gotta finish up building my HQ and about 3000 AR to transport

{Reactions}

[05-Aug-24 09:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've got enough CLI to keep them all busy indefinitely, and could probably find up to 1000 MHL and 1500 I already produced that I could sell


[05-Aug-24 09:08 PM] tanda#0000
oh, well I only need like 700, but MHL looks so cheap to produce in general I couldn't resist planning out a production chain


[05-Aug-24 09:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fair enough. MHL is spiking hard right now though, so I wouldn't make any *huge* plans based on current numbers


[05-Aug-24 09:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
MOR and HRT prices look fairly normal, but ANT/BEN are really high right now


[05-Aug-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
if you could process and sell me `I`, I could step up a WEL planet to help defray some of that price increase


[05-Aug-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
but aren't you stepping down a bunch of bases still?


[05-Aug-24 09:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm down. And yeah, I'm shutting down most of my own production. I'm doing a lot of trading and stuff on behalf of KAWA still though cause I enjoy that part of the game and it isnt as demanding daily. I'm also keeping at least 1 base running though, and that's the 40 BMPs on Katoa


[05-Aug-24 09:13 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we have someone extracting CLI I can use. I can process that and sell it to you for posting at ANT. I'm trying to hold down BEN. If you post on ANT I'll match the ask


[05-Aug-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
I admit I'm confused at that last statement. You'll sell to me at BEN ASK prices so I can partly relist and partly reprocess `I`?


[05-Aug-24 09:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh, no I'm just saying that if you sell it at ANT I'll sell some at BEN if the goal is to try to bring prices down. Or I could remove my ad and you make some serious money 😆


[05-Aug-24 09:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
volume seems to be lower if anything, so I'm guessing the price spike is just a lack of supply. I posted a sell ad on BEN a couple days ago because the asks were *completely* empty


[05-Aug-24 09:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
so I think it will come down fast with a little more sold


[05-Aug-24 09:17 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, they're completely empty at ANT as well


[05-Aug-24 09:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
woah... alright, I'll ship some I asap if you set up the rest ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[05-Aug-24 09:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
just tell me where


[05-Aug-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
I should be able to get a WEL planet set up on Aceland within 36 hours, but I'm happy to pick up anything from ANT


[05-Aug-24 09:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
Hypnotically, to make CLI as profitable as HAL, it's need to be sold around $400, -> I at $2000, -> MHL at $6000


[05-Aug-24 09:25 PM] marat_sh#0000
in comparison to what other recipes the building can produce


[05-Aug-24 09:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
MHL is at 5-7k on ANT and BEN right now, and CLI/I is *dirt cheap* most of the time. *Waaaay* oversupplied and about 1/3 what I'd expect it to be at to be decently profitable. So if you're buying the I, then selling MHL is solid right now


[05-Aug-24 09:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
long term ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ TRU is still best for WEL I think


[05-Aug-24 09:32 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
HE and FE are also priced fairly low, so short term this is pretty good. But yeah, CLI is only used for 2 things, and people don't usually jump into the middle of either of those chains. CLI -> I -> MHL for people running HYF. And with such low trade volume of MHL on CX, I think a lot of people running HYF make their own or source it from a trade deal. The other is SOI and similar. Used for ORC and POPI upkeep. I think for both of those people are just making what they need for themselves. Not a lot of public demand. HAL will always be better on CX because the things after it in most production chains are high volume, used a lot for ships, HQ upgrades, and POPI (the main production sinks in the game)


[05-Aug-24 09:33 PM] avalock#0000
@tanda @.urpalhal @jcheung have fun nerds :P


[05-Aug-24 09:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
100% agree. It's very easy to oversupply I and drop it's value considerably. Much better to bulk produce it yourself then use it until you ran out


[05-Aug-24 09:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
now that supply is dried up though, we could set MHL at a better place though. maybe 5-6k, and I think that could eventually stick


[05-Aug-24 09:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I doubt I or CLI can easily hit a healthy place though. They're just needed in such low and specific amounts


[05-Aug-24 09:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
Your BMPs can have very little output, like if I put it at 10% of my daily production it can cover a lot of WEL (MHL)


[05-Aug-24 09:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
but if people make a base to produce I it's not great


[05-Aug-24 09:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
man, sometimes I feel like I need a manufacturing base with a mix of BMPs and WELs. so many useful things that you really only need in small quantities

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Aug-24 09:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah, the 10% is still more profitable making something else and buying the I, but I don't really care 😅 KAWA internal market prices make basically anything sold externally profitable


[05-Aug-24 09:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
manufacturing is sooooo versatile and convenient. Not as profitable as some other industries, but super flexible. I think having at least one manufacturing base and one construction base is just a QoL improvement to any empire, lol


[05-Aug-24 09:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
Or having one guy managing all BMPs in corp


[05-Aug-24 09:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll add it to my ever-growing list of "bases I should build with all these spare permits someday"

{Reactions}
😆 

[05-Aug-24 09:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
i've hit 14 bases and kinda stopped expanding


[05-Aug-24 09:44 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
lol, that was exactly my peak before I started shutting things down. I feel you. I never even expected to pass 8, 14 was way too much for me. I like planning and expanding but I think I'll just be more mobile in the future. Keep my one big base on Katoa then just occasionally drop another RE base or something for a single repair cycle then demo it. I just stopped enjoying the management of all that. To each their own though. I play this game weird I think, lol


[05-Aug-24 09:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just can't wait to see what these 40 BMPs can do with this faction bonus once I free up all these permits, lol


[05-Aug-24 09:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
6/20 permits with manufacturing bonus, CoGC, 5 experts... 😊


[05-Aug-24 09:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just need to consolidate a lot. resupplying bases like Nike makes me want to quit every 10 days 😬

I'm considering moving it to Yannick instead of Katoa though so I can build a corp HQ there for another 10

lol, I made a big batch of I a couple months ago to conserve C in KAWA during a shortage. I only produced it for 2 days and I'm still #7 on the 180d leaderboard, #3 on 90d.


[05-Aug-24 09:58 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
40 BMPs is not the most profitable setup. But it's silly and I like it, lol

alternative to removing airlock
turn it into greeting channel, but remove the gatekeeping function


[06-Aug-24 12:12 PM] tanda#0000
I'm actually okay with the gatekeeping function


[06-Aug-24 12:12 PM] tanda#0000
one of the big things people have to be able to do to cooperate here is read some simple instructions


[06-Aug-24 12:12 PM] jvaler#0000
see the gatekeeping was the original intention by australis afaik, but i have no idea *why*


[06-Aug-24 12:12 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm personally not terribly against the gate either, but i have no strong feelings about it either way

[06-Aug-24 12:13 PM] igfloz#0000
I've been on other servers that have a gatekeeping channel, it has always been a member that ends up spamming the channels (due to their discord account being compromised, not the server)


[06-Aug-24 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
and we are effectively a public server at this point, even UFO gets spammed sometimes


[06-Aug-24 12:14 PM] jvaler#0000

[06-Aug-24 12:16 PM] tanda#0000
I'm 100% okay with redefining the member role, but I thought you guys were using it partially to keep track of who got the AGP?


[06-Aug-24 12:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
Haven't happend... yet


[06-Aug-24 12:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
For my part, I’m not sure the distinction between member and associate is super useful unless we’re restricting certain features of ADI (grants, markets, etc.) doesn’t mean it needs to be removed


[06-Aug-24 12:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
As long as we keep the coordinator role so I can continue feeling special and important, I’m happy 😁

edited the announcement to mention the counterpoint tanda brought up


[06-Aug-24 12:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think we pretty much stopped tracking the grants at this point


[06-Aug-24 12:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
Which is kinda a shame because it was cool to see how much was donated, but it was also a lot of bookkeeping


[06-Aug-24 12:24 PM] jvaler#0000
oh i missed that message
member role was never used to track grants, AGP has it's own role


[06-Aug-24 12:24 PM] tanda#0000
a public sheet with just admin access shouldn't be too hard to maintain, right?


[06-Aug-24 12:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
It shouldn’t be, but it is sometimes 😅


[06-Aug-24 12:24 PM] tanda#0000
ah well, the member/associate thing has always been blurry to me


[06-Aug-24 12:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think we had messages tracking the grants in #agp-grant-log


[06-Aug-24 12:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
But not sure if that’s a comprehensive log or not


[06-Aug-24 12:25 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah it was cool, but it stopped being maintained during australis' burnout. and they didn't want to replace it with the one i made

i have a fully functional sheet that i made, but i feel like implementing it now is pointless due to how many people aren't going to be accounted for on it


[06-Aug-24 12:26 PM] tanda#0000
I think implementing is still a good idea.


[06-Aug-24 12:26 PM] tanda#0000
if nothing else, if it's publicly visible it does show we do grants as much as we say we do


[06-Aug-24 12:26 PM] jvaler#0000
it's only got people since i took over the server, cause i made that channel


[06-Aug-24 12:27 PM] jvaler#0000
hmmmmmmmm i like that


[06-Aug-24 12:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
If we still have access to Australia’ sheet, we can at least copy the historical stuff over


[06-Aug-24 12:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i have access to their old sheet, but they have a private sheet that was used in the interim between them burning out and handing over the server


[06-Aug-24 12:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
But $x Million donated under jvaler’s management isn’t a bad headline either 😄

okay this isn't too bad


[06-Aug-24 01:07 PM] jvaler#0000
the gap in data for 4 months is sad but oh well


[06-Aug-24 01:07 PM] jvaler#0000
what's sadder is how few grants have been given out lately

[06-Aug-24 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
australis was already on his way out


[06-Aug-24 01:09 PM] evany.#0000

[06-Aug-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I used to advertise them on Phobos and Harmonia, since that's where the new players were. Nothing specific to the planet other than that


[06-Aug-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
The planet chats on UFO never got a ton of use, but a while ago they got more attention than they do now


[06-Aug-24 02:24 PM] evany.#0000

[06-Aug-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah yeah sometimes new players don't know where they started so I look up their planet for them 😄


[06-Aug-24 02:26 PM] evany.#0000

‘Google Is a Monopolist,’ Judge Rules in Landmark Antitrust Case
The ruling on Google’s search dominance was the first antitrust decision of the modern internet era in a case against a technology giant.

[06-Aug-24 02:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Heck yeah something will be done. This will get appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court 😄


[06-Aug-24 02:59 PM] tanda#0000
considering that a huge reason google is dominant at this point is brand name recognition, what can they even do?


[06-Aug-24 03:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The administration on antitrust has become a lot more vicious, which is great. Hopefully it will be a Bell system type break up


[06-Aug-24 03:00 PM] jcheung#0000
and buying up companies and burning them to the ground, then releasing a watered down feature a few years later that loosely resembles what they bought


[06-Aug-24 03:00 PM] akyantor#0000
They can not pay other massive company's (cough cough Apple) to make their search engine the default


[06-Aug-24 03:01 PM] tanda#0000
it's not like one company owns too much steel production capabilities, even if you split google up, one of them will still be google the search engine


[06-Aug-24 03:01 PM] akyantor#0000
You can prevent them from prioritising the surfacing their own non-search products ahead of other providers (e.g. maps, youtube)


[06-Aug-24 03:02 PM] akyantor#0000
There's a bunch of things that you could do that might not reduce their search dominence, but stop them rolling that dominence into advantages across other products.


[06-Aug-24 03:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that’s a good point. Dominance != monopoly necessarily, it’s how you use it


[06-Aug-24 03:03 PM] akyantor#0000
100%


[06-Aug-24 03:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
(In my opinion, maybe not in law 😄)


[06-Aug-24 03:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't know what type of impact this will have on firefox. It's the primary non-chromium competitor but also most of their budget is from google legal bribes


[06-Aug-24 03:04 PM] akyantor#0000
It's particularly true given they've been crap at making new products of their own, most of the other products they've made are either copies of other peoples products (gmail cloned hotmail), or they've bought (youtube). They've then leveraged their position in search to make those products more popular.


[06-Aug-24 03:05 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd say even their search product isn't want it used to be... how often do you now have to add "reddit" or "wiki" to a search to find a relevant result, rather than a wall of nonsense AI/spam sites


[06-Aug-24 03:06 PM] akyantor#0000
It gained dominence primarily because it was the best search, but it doesn't feel like that any more


[06-Aug-24 03:06 PM] igfloz#0000
didn't I hear somewhere that either google or bing has removed "reddit" from search results ? i.e. you wont get any reddit results

that's what i said


[06-Aug-24 03:17 PM] igfloz#0000
Yeah, I saw that - I  reacted to part of what Akya posted "I'd say even their search product isn't want it used to be... how often do you now have to add "reddit" or "wiki" to a search to find a relevant result"


[06-Aug-24 03:18 PM] igfloz#0000
...so even adding reddit to your search doesn't get the results you expect


[06-Aug-24 03:19 PM] igfloz#0000
...well, if you use google it does I suppose (which I dont)


[06-Aug-24 03:28 PM] evany.#0000
To be fair that could be due to the fact that reddit killed third party api. A lot of people stopped using it


[06-Aug-24 03:30 PM] evany.#0000
Not even stopped using it, but it was the highly active users ie the ones that posted content spun up arguments and got into the shit that were more likely using api reliant mechanics, so they kind of killed themselves with it


[06-Aug-24 03:47 PM] jvaler#0000
oh wow stuff from even before the first sheet, tysm!

but POPR in 1.5 days doesn't leave a lot of decision time


[06-Aug-24 05:13 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm talking about the burr, but the bases also sound terrible too


[07-Aug-24 09:20 AM] riseoffilth#0000
did someone ask me about SPFs and making WCBs the other day?


[07-Aug-24 09:20 AM] riseoffilth#0000
i remember seeing the ping on my phone, but couldnt find the question later


[07-Aug-24 09:38 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I asked about SKFs, but I think the plan is now a separate base with SKFs


[07-Aug-24 10:42 AM] avalock#0000
@jcheung do you need ALO?


[07-Aug-24 12:17 PM] evany.#0000
funny you mention that. next time icatch you online i do have some questions for you


[07-Aug-24 01:14 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Yes, I have them, and I have spare production capacity. I just lack AST and FET


[07-Aug-24 01:46 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think you guys finalized your production ratios, in #cult-office on the weekend?


[07-Aug-24 01:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Different stuff


[07-Aug-24 01:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ah, k.


[07-Aug-24 01:50 PM] jcheung#0000
Rise is an established shipbuilder, we were looking at starting up some stuff


[07-Aug-24 02:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ye. Just keep in mind, whatever you do. WCB starter upgrades have a limited market (2 per newbro who keeps PRO). Beyond that it's all PRO, who need **new** WCBs. Maybe we, and he? can accomodate whatever plans arise.


[07-Aug-24 02:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I said this in a previous, discussion, just reiterating, since it's my point. Up to you, in whatever you do.


[07-Aug-24 02:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes. I think the plan is to focus on these upgrade kits for the moment, and expand later into full ships way down the line.


[07-Aug-24 02:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Going straight into full ships is just too much


[07-Aug-24 02:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But with time, you'll have capacity for it.


[07-Aug-24 02:24 PM] jcheung#0000
The startup costs for even just wcb kits right now is 23m and that's not including the feedstock


[07-Aug-24 02:25 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I didn't dig into the current stuff. #rl-stuff popped up just today. Maybe this weekend I can add some comment, if needed. Yeah, the ships are not cheap --- we've got a handful of competiting offers from different orgs ---- and well, they're **WELL** established to offer them.


[07-Aug-24 02:25 PM] tanda#0000
other than the fact that most of them are 3-4 weeks out on delivery and growing

{Reactions}
💯 

[07-Aug-24 02:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also the beginner kit person brings them up to CI


[07-Aug-24 02:27 PM] tanda#0000
yeah it was a trip having to use the FX just to get my ships fitted to WCBs


[07-Aug-24 02:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
uhm.... there is one person... If any of you can get the #deets on what Mr. Craftsman does, it'll go better with your discussions. (My guess - he's got alot of permits applied to the FTL production chains (specifically engines) --- look into his CO USR permit applications --- look into his LEAD production figures.


[07-Aug-24 02:27 PM] avalock#0000
fuck… what is the next thing i’m supposed to mine after i build my HQ i forget


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
TIO ?


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Were you going to be on the WCB kit team  ?


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] avalock#0000
nah i’m already mining TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] avalock#0000
i can mine more TIO if you want


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] avalock#0000
sure :3


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] tanda#0000
I mentioned CLI and HAL, but CLI looks to be a bad idea


[07-Aug-24 02:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I mean I have the #deets, just not the permits. Confirmation will be required, per current market trends, if they're inefficiencise evident.


[07-Aug-24 02:29 PM] tanda#0000
and well HAL is HAL. It'll sell


[07-Aug-24 02:29 PM] avalock#0000
not like i haven’t mined bad ideas before :3 (AR)


[07-Aug-24 02:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Evayoo and Jcheung are the ones planning it out mostly, I am not sure how much more TIO they need


[07-Aug-24 02:29 PM] tanda#0000
well, it's been a logistically bad idea, but hopefully not a financially bad idea


[07-Aug-24 02:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Alot/


[07-Aug-24 02:30 PM] avalock#0000
oh nah financially its been swell


[07-Aug-24 02:30 PM] avalock#0000
we’ll probably need to renegotiate contracts for prices if/when the price goes down


[07-Aug-24 02:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Search my postings on the cult office. There should be basic metrics for TIO --> TI, in screenies, and it's basically the majority of what you need for the larger cargo bays.


[07-Aug-24 02:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
or at least the WCBs


[07-Aug-24 02:31 PM] avalock#0000
129/day, v doable


[07-Aug-24 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
Tentatively, about a half a base worth... maybe a bit more


[07-Aug-24 02:32 PM] jcheung#0000
Assuming the current plan sticks


[07-Aug-24 02:32 PM] jcheung#0000
It's still being worked on


[07-Aug-24 02:33 PM] avalock#0000
give me the numbers, i may need a grant but its doable :3


[07-Aug-24 02:33 PM] avalock#0000
very doable


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] avalock#0000
do you need an ALO dog-girl as well or just TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] avalock#0000
o7


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Wait


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Maybe


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000
No, nvm. Get refined AL from one of the other processes


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] avalock#0000
gg


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000
Will actually have a tiny bit to sell, until LHP is included in the future


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] avalock#0000
😔 my ALO is useless gg


[07-Aug-24 02:36 PM] avalock#0000
how about FEO?


[07-Aug-24 02:36 PM] tanda#0000
one extractor could probably supply all the FE needed for that project


[07-Aug-24 02:37 PM] avalock#0000
heard


[07-Aug-24 02:37 PM] jcheung#0000
I think two


[07-Aug-24 02:37 PM] avalock#0000
so we just need a lot if TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:37 PM] jcheung#0000
..or was it 4


[07-Aug-24 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
282 TIO/d


[07-Aug-24 02:38 PM] tanda#0000
that's it?


[07-Aug-24 02:38 PM] avalock#0000
does anyone produce HSE?


[07-Aug-24 02:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
those are PP3 outputs?


[07-Aug-24 02:39 PM] avalock#0000
yee


[07-Aug-24 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, that requires TCS too. I could technically make them, but I would have to buy that input on the market


[07-Aug-24 02:39 PM] tanda#0000
I think HSE on the market is actually cheaper to buy there than it would be to produce it


[07-Aug-24 02:40 PM] avalock#0000
noted!


[07-Aug-24 02:40 PM] jcheung#0000
2 FEO EXT on vulcan


[07-Aug-24 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000
Sorry for delay, fighting sheets mobile


[07-Aug-24 02:41 PM] jcheung#0000
It sucks


[07-Aug-24 02:41 PM] avalock#0000
i can do that if you need


[07-Aug-24 02:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You have a hard opportunity cost, between R-fabs, INS, and HSE. PSH is depreciated, so don't bother on that one.


[07-Aug-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
For just the kits, yeah.


[07-Aug-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
I think what's really gonna hurt is 81 C/d


[07-Aug-24 02:44 PM] avalock#0000
OH I KNOW WHERE


[07-Aug-24 02:44 PM] avalock#0000
it kinda works out

[07-Aug-24 02:45 PM] avalock#0000
feo


[07-Aug-24 02:45 PM] tanda#0000
lol no way


[07-Aug-24 02:45 PM] jcheung#0000
😮


[07-Aug-24 02:45 PM] jcheung#0000
That's....


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
A long trip


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Why not vulcan


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] tanda#0000
honestly we shouldn't bother for extractors or smelters for FE for the project


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Throw down some SMEs with the rest of the base


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] tanda#0000
it's cheaper to import it, if it's not already being produced by someone there


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] avalock#0000
someone said the opportunity cost lmao


[07-Aug-24 02:46 PM] tanda#0000
not too mention KI-401b is a great spot for TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Dropping all SMEs isn't gonna be great


[07-Aug-24 02:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
this is to make FET for the WCBs, right?


[07-Aug-24 02:47 PM] avalock#0000
i already have SE-648c


[07-Aug-24 02:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah


[07-Aug-24 02:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
how much FET would you need for the project at this stage? just curious


[07-Aug-24 02:48 PM] avalock#0000
for TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:49 PM] tanda#0000
not all SMEs, we need those for the TI. just no point in using space for extractors and smelters specifically for FE or AL, when the whole project eats like 40 FE and 40 AL a day?


[07-Aug-24 02:49 PM] jcheung#0000
110 when at 5 expert full output


[07-Aug-24 02:49 PM] jcheung#0000
No SME or EXT for AL


[07-Aug-24 02:49 PM] jcheung#0000
AL is side product of other stuff


[07-Aug-24 02:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was looking into dropping some ASM for FET for OOG anyway, so I might be able to help out. I'd have to look at how much I can make


[07-Aug-24 02:50 PM] jcheung#0000
Also just putting out there that this is tentative

{Reactions}
🫡 

[07-Aug-24 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
The thing evayoo and i are struggling with right now is profit margin.... unless some grants happen, ROI for this project will be measured in years if we match 650k/kit


[07-Aug-24 02:52 PM] avalock#0000
oh wait now i remember someone wanted me to mine BOR for them


[07-Aug-24 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
Mostly from WF consumption


[07-Aug-24 02:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Don't even want to look at the other ship components right now to go full ships

There's the sheet btw


[07-Aug-24 02:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Any input would be useful. Already dropped W refining based on feedback


[07-Aug-24 02:57 PM] avalock#0000
okay i have the numbers, i should be able to set it up for like 350 TIO


[07-Aug-24 02:57 PM] avalock#0000
per day


[07-Aug-24 02:58 PM] jcheung#0000
At 648c?


[07-Aug-24 02:58 PM] avalock#0000
ye


[07-Aug-24 02:58 PM] avalock#0000
price tag is 750k


[07-Aug-24 02:58 PM] avalock#0000
765k*


[07-Aug-24 02:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's definite BUI ratios, on the full ships, however it could be better too look at them via BUI, versus BASE - wise.


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Note that this will be very, very low profit for a long time


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] avalock#0000
thats fine


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] avalock#0000
i don’t need profit right away


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Also can i convince you to also drop some rigs there for O? 😁


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can supplement "made-markets" via CX, on the other, more surplus stuff.


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] jcheung#0000
That's my plan


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ye.


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] avalock#0000
how about other area for O


[07-Aug-24 02:59 PM] jcheung#0000
I started breaking down by building, going to go deeper later


[07-Aug-24 03:00 PM] avalock#0000
oh wait is that area goated at O


[07-Aug-24 03:00 PM] jcheung#0000
What's the other O spot


[07-Aug-24 03:00 PM] avalock#0000
idk is that it?


[07-Aug-24 03:00 PM] avalock#0000
lmfao i just do what the voices say


[07-Aug-24 03:00 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmm. I guess we could also poke other people for O


[07-Aug-24 03:01 PM] avalock#0000
how much o you need?


[07-Aug-24 03:01 PM] avalock#0000
i can do 218 O + 300 TIO

once i’m done with my HQ i’ll get on this


[07-Aug-24 03:06 PM] avalock#0000
are there opportunities for grants or nah


[07-Aug-24 03:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Tbd


[07-Aug-24 03:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Probably loan at the minimum. Grant, no idea

[07-Aug-24 03:07 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm not the one with deep pockets


[07-Aug-24 03:07 PM] avalock#0000
i should be fine either way lol

[07-Aug-24 03:16 PM] jcheung#0000
What am i looking at here, interface is just unfamiliar enough that i don't know what you're trying to say is expensive


[07-Aug-24 03:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Investment, regarding better O extraction rates, via RIGs.


[07-Aug-24 03:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
HSE + INS -- idk what y'all do, though.


[07-Aug-24 03:18 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure. What alternatives do you have to offer for O extraction?


[07-Aug-24 03:18 PM] jcheung#0000
Or TIO


[07-Aug-24 03:18 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
SE-648c would be your best (if RES COGC).


[07-Aug-24 03:18 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
for O.


[07-Aug-24 03:18 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
but it's volume though, not margins.


[07-Aug-24 03:19 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure. What would you suggest for margins?


[07-Aug-24 03:19 PM] jcheung#0000
And how much difference will it be per unit of output after amortization over 3 months worth of production


[07-Aug-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Best amortization rates come after 6 months, when you're HABs empty all of their depreciation costs into your expense sheets.


[07-Aug-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Then you can cut the installation off from overall cost, and then just count the repair figures, into your calcs.


[07-Aug-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
Ignore the buildout cost and look only at the daily operations + repair


[07-Aug-24 03:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hard to do with the current planning software, unless you do the excel. SE-648c For TIO rates + COGC. I'll look into both, tomorrow. I'm out of time today.


[07-Aug-24 03:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, I'll do simple calcs by hand, but out of time.

how much p/u ?


[07-Aug-24 03:55 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I can do 10,500/u


[07-Aug-24 03:55 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
114 on Nike and 114 on ANT at the moment


[07-Aug-24 04:00 PM] tanda#0000
ooh, I need 41 of those too


[07-Aug-24 04:00 PM] evany.#0000
yeah thats why i asked for our little project tanda


[07-Aug-24 04:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Send conts either at ANT or Nike


[07-Aug-24 04:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
How many units ?


[07-Aug-24 05:35 PM] evany.#0000
i believe i need about 50


[07-Aug-24 05:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Aight, then send a contract whenever you want it


[07-Aug-24 05:38 PM] evany.#0000

Mmm, where did I leave off.....

Oh yes, the TIO/O extractions, based off nearest to ANT + highest resource densities on any given planet, + COGC presence. 

Both resources defer to SE-648c, as being the ideal candidate, for seriously increasing such resource provision to market, or group. There's only ~20 guys there, on planet, as of now. 

The amortization metrics, first 90 days, for both, is given via the screenies. (Colony cost is everything, for the first 180 days of activity. Once that passes, your HABs will have incurred full depreciation, so if anything will be long-term, you're looking at the Repair costs per day, which per the pic, is just your net profit. We'll need to substitute a figure, for pre-amortization figures though (this is just full cost, minus CM/HAB costs). The rates should be all current ANT ASK rates).

Pre-180 amortization, break even prices for TIO, from such an operation is 44 AIC/u TIO. The assumption is 5 experts flat. You will experience deficiencies when you start up.
```( {180 days * (Daily Input Costs [12,830] + Daily Repair Costs [5,695.05]) } + CM/HAB segment [385,596]) / (Daily Output TIO [180 * 469.72])```

Post-180 amortizaation, break even prices for TIO, from such an operation is 39.5 AIC/u TIO.
```{Daily Input Costs [12,830] + Daily Repair Costs [5,695.05]} / {Daily Output TIO [469.72]}```


[08-Aug-24 06:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Pre-180 amortization, break even prices for O, from such operation is 13.5 AIC/u O.
```( {180 days * (Daily Input Costs [15,398] + Daily Repair Costs [8,352]) } + CM/HAB segment [471,288]) / (Daily Output O [180 * 1,958.10])```

Post-180 amortizaation, break even prices for TIO, from such an operation is 12.1 AIC/u O.
```{Daily Input Costs [15,398] + Daily Repair Costs [8,352]} / {Daily Output O [1,968.10]}```


[08-Aug-24 06:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
**These numbers are also without logistical concerns.** Each TIO base instance, on site, will require ~750t/470m3 servicing daily. Each O base instance, on site, will require, 2250t/1970m3 servicing daily <--- this one is a doosie.

Anyways, these are just pure base figures. Bases in PRUN are not isolated things, and will need consideration as to how you will price out logistical requirements, which should be docked in the numerator, of the instanced formulas. Anything beyond the break evens, is profit, of any interested, should take advantage of, to which I'm not going to set a figure for.

Prunplanner should have similar metrics displays. I just posted my method, for input/suggestion/example. (I don't like prunplanner --- it's too slow. I don't like excel, for similar reasons).


[08-Aug-24 07:06 AM] avalock#0000
i just have a base there already, i’ll just set up the TIO and O stuff for fun


[08-Aug-24 07:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yup. Just a note as to why i picked that planet. I look for resource densities, especially on anything that could be at a liquid state, on the planetary standard temperatures, and pressures. You'll get far better extraction rates, and thus potential margins, should you dive-in deep, for pure daily production returns. It's far better than what you'll get near any CX, but I also filter for such things, since building more FTL ships, is quite expensive, for most people. There's also more "buyer beware" stuff, but I'm just addressing the immediate question.

Since you said here, that it's expensive

[08-Aug-24 11:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve never gotten that deep because if the task is that complicated, I’ll usually switch to R or something if it’s just for my own use. But being able to share gsheets with everyone is so convenient

[08-Aug-24 04:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think I'll address both the "expensive" and "different options" in one go, for both the TIO / O. 

* The expensiveness is strictly determined: increasing your willingness to operate on more harsh planetary environments (MGC/SEA/INS | BL/TSH/HSE}. They give a much higher initial colony cost figures, and they just bloat your daily repair costs. These things don't matter if the resource density/state on the planet, simply outweighs everything else, since it's that good [think SE-648c]. 

* Your potential alternatives for TIO can be something like AU-605c (Food Industries COGC). It's alright, since it has a good resource density, and very low building/repair costs, but it's something like 12 jumps from both HRT and ANT, so it's somewhere down south, and I don't want to commit ships on like 3-5 day single trips for just a single pickup each week.

* Your potential alternatives for O can be on say something like KW-688c (Etherwind and Resource Extraction COGC). It's only 7j from ANT, and is rather close to BEN, but I'd be huffing the water, if I was there. The oxygen on that planet is also in a gaseous state, and suffers from extraction inefficiencies, since you have to use the COLs, instead of RIGs. 

**I think both alternatives are still really good, so I can't make a discreet point as to what I think should be preferred.** But if say SE-648c's build/repair costs got increased significantly, due to high CX costs from the stuff getting bought out, or Oxygen's market price tanks due to oversupply..... I'd definitely take a second look on SE-648c, to see if it's still viable for operation, since I wouldn't want to keep a world, that makes less money/d than my other processes.

Other commodities could be very different --- ANT just has very good options for TIO/O.

[08-Aug-24 04:31 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure... so what's the post 180d cost for each material from each of those locations? Is there a difference of over 10 credits per unit extracted?


[08-Aug-24 04:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah let me just pull those numbers out, quickly.


[08-Aug-24 04:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Now this is more gut feeling since you don't have the numbers out right now, but...

It feels like stepping over dollars to pick up pennies to start a base that far away from the ops area to save on extraction maybe 2 credits a unit on O and maybe 5 credits on TIO (if it was something like pg or pe, i would reconsider, but it's not)

When you also look at the logistical considerations, the longer flight time and ftl duration means you need more ships and to repair your existing ships more frequently compared to just taking the slightly more "expensive" to extract options...

I'm not saying that the additional costs are to be always ignored, but in this case i really feel like the gains are minor while the costs in logistics go up 3x


[08-Aug-24 04:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
AU-605c's CH/HABs are 309,840

Pre-180; break even prices for TIO, from such an operation is 40.7 AIC/u.
```( {180 days * (Daily Input Costs [12,766] + Daily Repair Costs [2,155.22]) } + CM/HAB segment [309,840]) / (Daily Output O [180 * 409.23])```

Post-180 amortizaation, break even prices for TIO, from such an operation is 36.5 AIC/u.
```{Daily Input Costs [12,766] + Daily Repair Costs [2,155.22]} / {Daily Output TIO [409.23]}```



Etherwind's CM/HABs are 368,550

Pre-180; break even prices for O, from such an operation is 21.6 AIC/u O.
```( {180 days * (Daily Input Costs [16,313] + Daily Repair Costs [3,155.55]) } + CM/HAB segment [368,550]) / (Daily Output O [180 * 996.70])```

Post-180 amortizaation, break even prices for O, from such an operation is 19.6 AIC/u O.
```{Daily Input Costs [16,313] + Daily Repair Costs [3,155.55]} / {Daily Output TIO [996.70]}```


[08-Aug-24 04:48 PM] jcheung#0000

Ah...


[08-Aug-24 04:54 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah --- I've picked good examples, so picking pennies between options is potentially trivial. You will experience tangible differences in your Prun experience, depending on what you choose to do. 10 ships being clicked to go there, and back, just for one 500 area base, either far out, or close to you.... or just a partial base, with only 1 ship going there a week? Who knows these things...

[08-Aug-24 11:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And now for something completely different.

Anyone want a free base? I need more LI, and SE-648a is a great place to extract LIO. All you gotta do is extract LIO and I send contracts on site to grab it away and smelt it all. You just fill the conts and make money. 37.5k/day profit after upkeep and repair costs

wild. you mean people don't spend 12h in their first week playing just investigating rain's spreadsheets to learn the functions to create their own tools? or learn to code so they can make a production chain calculator for planning large scale projects? (I might have a problem 😆 )


[09-Aug-24 08:51 PM] tanda#0000
I don't know about everyone else, but my brain sees complicated spreadsheets and just kinda shortcircuits


[09-Aug-24 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
who's rain


[09-Aug-24 09:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Meh. I think it took me like 2 weeks, to go through all the details (still learning, just less downtime for it to happen now).....

I'm not touching the spreadsheets though. I did when I was younger, doing the EVE-Online production chains.... Then their REST API got "updated" not once, but twice, over a span of ~2 years, which broke my original sheets, and my updated ones...


[09-Aug-24 09:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'll still do custom sheets for stuff, however I'm completely avoiding anything that relies on API inputs, since their version control is not subject to any inputs of mine.


[09-Aug-24 09:06 PM] jcheung#0000
what did you say? time to make your own API?

[10-Aug-24 11:40 AM] tanda#0000
I've given some more thought to this specific point I made, and while I still think Airlock serves a great purpose as a gatekeeper, I do think it also hurts retention rates. Perhaps if the majority of channels on the server were visible, but read only? They would still need to fulfill the directives in Airlock in order to participate, but they'll be able to see that there's actually an active community in the server worth participating in

[10-Aug-24 01:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The rest of the server being read only is a good idea


[10-Aug-24 01:38 PM] .shiva.#0000
BTW you should be able to make the sever read only with only a couple minor role tweaks, no need to edit everyone


[10-Aug-24 01:38 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that'll be easy

[10-Aug-24 01:49 PM] akyantor#0000
I’d be minded to make internal offers only visible upon receiving a role. I suspect most folks intent those to be available to members of the community.

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Aug-24 01:49 PM] akyantor#0000
Otherwise making everything else read only makes sense


[10-Aug-24 01:50 PM] .shiva.#0000
Sever settings -> Roles -> role you want everyone in -> add members -> click a lot of check boxes and done


[10-Aug-24 05:31 PM] tanda#0000
so random realization: as big of a pain in the ass as FE is, it's like 12k better RoI to just make Bfabs out of


[10-Aug-24 05:32 PM] jcheung#0000
I also noted some of that


[10-Aug-24 05:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And PP1 make BDE out of PE instead


[10-Aug-24 05:42 PM] tanda#0000
might be a good idea for a hybrid base to just churn out bfabs


[10-Aug-24 05:48 PM] tanda#0000
there's not really a good place to put that into action, sadly


[10-Aug-24 05:49 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If no WCBs: (Vulcan:Bfabs | Deimos :L/B-fabs). If WCBs: Nike (L/B-fabs) <--> Deimos (AL) | Vulcan (FE).


[10-Aug-24 05:50 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm just thinking because I've been running out of construction planets already


[10-Aug-24 05:54 PM] jcheung#0000
What did you say, make a new one in a system adjacent to deimos?


[10-Aug-24 05:54 PM] tanda#0000
that would be ideal, yes


[10-Aug-24 06:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

yes, direct neighboring systems are ZV-307, ZV-194, ZV-896

^ Ye, it's an old tool.


[10-Aug-24 06:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The FIO Planet search, with COGC filters could be better, but you'll still be eventually doing the ROI calcs, via Prunplanner or something, for viability, as compared to Deimos/Vulcan/Nike.


[10-Aug-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
let's see. looks like roughly... very roughly.... 7 AML : 7 WEL : 2 PP4  to go from BER to TSH


[10-Aug-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
probably closer to 8 AMLs but i'm rounding/estimating


[10-Aug-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
and ofc the BE would have to be shipped in


[10-Aug-24 06:48 PM] jcheung#0000
....ah, screw it. gonna go for more AMLs i guess. my debt gets deeper by the week


[10-Aug-24 06:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
From what I've heard, MOR bros are pushing the prices down for the specialty TSH/HSE goodies. It could be better to import them, if you can't build up a working group for such things, in-house, @ ANT.


[10-Aug-24 06:55 PM] jcheung#0000
looks like it's trending down, yeah


[10-Aug-24 06:55 PM] jcheung#0000
they have... a bunch around 25k


[10-Aug-24 06:56 PM] jcheung#0000
wouldn't hurt to have our own production


[11-Aug-24 12:02 PM] scorpy6225#0000
Any Nitrogen production around here? Cx is kinda short


[11-Aug-24 12:22 PM] jcheung#0000
i think the closest with decent yield and people settled is zv-639d.... but i also doubt it's producing much N


[11-Aug-24 12:25 PM] tanda#0000
dang, who ran the N out on the CX?


[11-Aug-24 12:29 PM] akyantor#0000
It looks like there was a much larger than usual buy of N on the 28th, and it's just tapped out the remaining supply that was available since then.


[11-Aug-24 12:51 PM] scorpy6225#0000
Dang so we rlly got nothing lmao


[11-Aug-24 12:52 PM] scorpy6225#0000
glad i have a bit stockpiled


[11-Aug-24 12:53 PM] tanda#0000
looks like we need some more pumps on ZV-639d


[11-Aug-24 12:55 PM] scorpy6225#0000
Most is probably going straight into NS production


[11-Aug-24 01:00 PM] tanda#0000
I think everyone is probably extracting on the spot for what they need there and maybe running a small surplus

[11-Aug-24 03:42 PM] finestone#0000
ZV-896g or WU-070i could be good new colonies for N, but yeah ZV-639d is pretty much your only option atm in the A1 area.

If you want it, a good option for you is UV-234g, which is Benten periphery.

I can see why the F market is so slow, it's a pain to extract, you don't need much of it, it's only used to make BL, and BL seems to be barely used

BL is only requred one per building

honestly I think that makes it cheaper than TSH and HSE

[16-Aug-24 05:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's probably low, since you might be more likely to drop on an MCG/INS +- HSE planet, than you would be dropping on something that needs SEA; this of course depends on your priorities... There's also the area cost multiples.

Roundabouts at all those intersections too. But people will never do that, since nice, big, square buildings, with thousands of square footage, that is mainly used for aesthetics, simply does not fit well in polygonal survey plots.

your plan calls for one more hab than necessary


[18-Aug-24 09:21 PM] tanda#0000
you could keep the hab and add an extra 2 SME, but you would have to buy a bit of ALO every so often (about 100 every 4 days)

idk tbh  lol thought made a difference lol


[18-Aug-24 09:25 PM] jcheung#0000
you're doing ratios


[18-Aug-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
it's calculated by percentage of run time


[18-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000
so like imagine your queue


[18-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jvaler#0000
each of those orders reflects 1 recurring order ingame, and ingame having 6 of the same recurring order makes no difference to having a single of that recurring order


[18-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000
not % of runtime, exactly


[18-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jvaler#0000
building count and efficiency % is all that matters

imagine it as your input queue


[18-Aug-24 09:26 PM] jvaler#0000
you should put those order sizes to 1 too, cause you should have them at 1 ingame for the quickest response time


[18-Aug-24 09:27 PM] jcheung#0000
if you put 1 ALO repeating, it's the same as 6 ALO repeating, or 1 ALO 1 ALO 1 ALO 1 ALO 1 ALO 1 ALO repeating

Achilles is Shrouded in Myth as being demi-god but it is later clarified to not be the case .... implying no one had ever managed that before. Achilles vs. Boagrius.

Kombucha (also tea mushroom, tea fungus, or Manchurian mushroom when referring to the culture; Latin name Medusomyces gisevii)[1] is a fermented, lightly effervescent, sweetened black tea drink.

Praying on the tech bro downfall is a good start, I wish governments would take more action on it though


[23-Aug-24 10:54 AM] jvaler#0000
you know at least crypto and nfts were insulated, they didn't hurt a bunch of things when they crashed


[23-Aug-24 10:56 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well, all 3 hurt the environment to some extent


[23-Aug-24 10:56 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Which seems to be a reoccuring theme

[23-Aug-24 10:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Why would they do that when they're so eager shooting at their own feets ?

But when we want to, we double check the CXOBs first, then check our FINLAs to make sure that we can. Click buy. Capture Screenies, and then post WWE memes on UFO, and on here?!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2wb9OGZZ1Y

🤔 would it be difficult to get into the smelting business


[25-Aug-24 09:31 AM] avalock#0000
I mine all this ore, and now I'm extracting Oxygen


[25-Aug-24 09:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
go up in production chain


[25-Aug-24 09:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
Seems like you’re 90% of the way there 😄


[25-Aug-24 09:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
if you have access of raw resources that are not being sold, refine them


[25-Aug-24 09:33 AM] avalock#0000
yeah maybe 🤔


[25-Aug-24 09:34 AM] marat_sh#0000
or... rise the price for raw resources 😈


[25-Aug-24 09:36 AM] avalock#0000
lolol


[25-Aug-24 09:40 AM] jvaler#0000
it'd be very easy for you because you're already doing like 70% of the work exporting all that ore. having AL as backhaul to ANT doesn't take any extra effort, and C+O are easy to import compared to the ore


[25-Aug-24 09:41 AM] avalock#0000
yeah, I just gotta look for a good planet


[25-Aug-24 09:42 AM] jvaler#0000
SE-648a could handle stuff from your SE-648c base


[25-Aug-24 09:43 AM] avalock#0000

[25-Aug-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
but it's like 4 jumps from CX


[25-Aug-24 09:45 AM] jvaler#0000
WU-070a got named?


[25-Aug-24 09:46 AM] jvaler#0000
oh wow @akyantor congrats


[25-Aug-24 09:47 AM] avalock#0000
the only problem with wu-070a is that Its kinda out of the way for a lot of my stuff besides argon


[25-Aug-24 09:47 AM] jvaler#0000
it seems to be ~4hrs more than ANT <-> nascent


[25-Aug-24 09:48 AM] jvaler#0000
which is surprising since it's so much further... i didn't know FTL time was jump based instead of distance based


[25-Aug-24 09:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
There is also 'Antares III c' but it's SEA + INS


[25-Aug-24 09:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Thanks. There's a decent pop so thought it'd be good to name it. Not a good spot for regular smelting... due to the distance think most people use Hyalos for making stuff with SIO.


[25-Aug-24 09:49 AM] jvaler#0000
what's the name mean tho...


[25-Aug-24 09:49 AM] jvaler#0000
it sounds weird to say


[25-Aug-24 09:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
@avalock that one I think in the same system you have your LST


[25-Aug-24 09:50 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[25-Aug-24 09:50 AM] jvaler#0000
SME doesn't interact with LST tho

unless you count FLX in CHP... but FLX prod on metallurgy CoGC is terrible value


[25-Aug-24 09:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
I mean for logistics point of view


[25-Aug-24 09:51 AM] akyantor#0000
It means [glass in latin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hyalos), origin from ancient greek. Thought it somewhat relevant given the main production on the planet.

[25-Aug-24 09:52 AM] jvaler#0000
oh wait i was thinking nike first then zv-194d, but yeah you could import ore/C/O first and then export LST on the way out

though metallurgy already produces it's own high density output... so i don't know how helpful that actually is


[25-Aug-24 09:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
There is also IY-816e... No COGC


[25-Aug-24 09:53 AM] jvaler#0000

[25-Aug-24 09:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
the one that is not settled


[25-Aug-24 09:55 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's just INS


[25-Aug-24 09:55 AM] jvaler#0000
c is just HSE


[25-Aug-24 09:55 AM] jvaler#0000
and already has infrastructure in place


[25-Aug-24 09:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
i don't know which is more expancive HSE or INS


[25-Aug-24 09:56 AM] jvaler#0000
iirc they're about even last i checked


[25-Aug-24 09:57 AM] marat_sh#0000
well in that case Vulcan then


[25-Aug-24 09:57 AM] jvaler#0000
actually no HSE is much better

20 SME + 10 HB1 + 1 CM


[25-Aug-24 09:58 AM] jvaler#0000
and there's currently HSE on CXOB that's ~2k cheaper than 13.5k anyways


[25-Aug-24 09:59 AM] avalock#0000
This is gonna be like 4 plans out lmfao, I should say ahead of this is
- Upgrade production
 - ALO + LST bases getting complete
- Upgrade Logistics system
 - 2nd WCB
 - 3rd ship


[25-Aug-24 10:00 AM] avalock#0000
I'm thinking of making a like... distribution center-type base


[25-Aug-24 10:01 AM] avalock#0000

ANT III - d


[25-Aug-24 10:01 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah HSE is better


[25-Aug-24 10:01 AM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah i forgor STO


[25-Aug-24 10:01 AM] marat_sh#0000
20 SME, 10 HB1, 1 STO


[25-Aug-24 10:02 AM] jvaler#0000
2 STO*


[25-Aug-24 10:02 AM] jvaler#0000

[25-Aug-24 10:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
2 STO Vulcan


[25-Aug-24 10:04 AM] avalock#0000
so what I take from it, this would actually be a pretty good operation :3


[25-Aug-24 10:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yes


[25-Aug-24 10:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
If you want you can start with like 5 SME


[25-Aug-24 10:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
and slowly build up to 20 SME


[25-Aug-24 10:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
Less upfront cost


[25-Aug-24 10:05 AM] avalock#0000
might do that yeah


[25-Aug-24 10:05 AM] avalock#0000
Imma build up some other stuff first, my logistics network is uhhhh very slow


[25-Aug-24 10:09 AM] avalock#0000
I wonder what would be a good ratio for TIO/ALO smelting 🤔


[25-Aug-24 10:09 AM] avalock#0000
ig 50/50


[25-Aug-24 10:10 AM] marat_sh#0000
what ore do you have in access that is not being sold?


[25-Aug-24 10:10 AM] avalock#0000
I'm thinking it would just be my exess ore, TIO/ALO mostly


[25-Aug-24 10:11 AM] avalock#0000
I do want to mine more ores tho...


[25-Aug-24 10:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
You not gonna make whole lot of profit from AL in comparison to Ti but It's harder to sell Ti


[25-Aug-24 10:11 AM] avalock#0000
SIO/FEO could be fun to get into even if not profitable

yes :3


[25-Aug-24 10:13 AM] avalock#0000
I think it would be neat for my like uhhhh logistics network to get big enough for that


[25-Aug-24 10:13 AM] avalock#0000
and to work towards that


[25-Aug-24 10:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
Good idea would be to start small and while you grow you will see what sells and what not


[25-Aug-24 10:14 AM] avalock#0000
yeee


[25-Aug-24 10:14 AM] jvaler#0000
actually FE is mostly used for either PP1 bfabs or for turning into other metallurgy products. turning the FE into STL would probably be more useful


[25-Aug-24 10:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
^ Fe is for STL mostly


[25-Aug-24 10:14 AM] avalock#0000
hmmmm, I think SIO before FEO


[25-Aug-24 10:15 AM] avalock#0000
honestly most of the stuff I sell it through here, I don't post a lot on CX lol

[25-Aug-24 10:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
as a side note... If you cut off their supply for AR... you will indirectly rise the price for it + make goods that use AR cheaper to produce yourself


[25-Aug-24 10:19 AM] marat_sh#0000
but that would be mean


[25-Aug-24 10:19 AM] avalock#0000
yeah I don't want to be mean to Kevin people


[25-Aug-24 10:19 AM] avalock#0000
my TIO/O might also be getting claimed by the ship building people >.>


[25-Aug-24 10:20 AM] marat_sh#0000
that's why I said to use items that are not being used and refine them Let's say you make 120 AR per day and you sell 100 per day. Use that 20 to make something


[25-Aug-24 10:20 AM] avalock#0000
yeaaaah could do that


[25-Aug-24 10:21 AM] avalock#0000
tho AR is p much only for INS


[25-Aug-24 10:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
if they are not using all of that AR, start making your own INS


[25-Aug-24 10:21 AM] avalock#0000
could potentially do... Aceland is kinda becoming my hub


[25-Aug-24 10:22 AM] marat_sh#0000
in addition to that you will rise the demand for AR so you can make more AR bases


[25-Aug-24 10:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you decide to make INS, I’ll sell you THF at Kevin prices 🙂


[25-Aug-24 10:23 AM] avalock#0000
lmao, I could just become the 3rd Kevin person

my thing is all about eating raw resources thooo


[25-Aug-24 10:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
see that more of a side hustle


[25-Aug-24 10:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I get that. I was initially doing all farming + chemistry for farming. I branched out because more farming got boring 😄


[25-Aug-24 10:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
But if you’re still enjoying raw resources, you can totally keep doing that too


[25-Aug-24 10:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's just you will be waiting for people to expand the demand for AR when you can increase it yourself


[25-Aug-24 10:25 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee, I just want to mine and extract more :P


[25-Aug-24 10:25 AM] avalock#0000
I think this would be a save for later for me


[25-Aug-24 10:26 AM] avalock#0000
after I get more raw resources


[25-Aug-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
There is nothing wrong with that. I do manufacturing and not planning branching out, so I will have to wait for demand to increase before I can expand myself


[25-Aug-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000
valid :3


[25-Aug-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000
for now I will be the supply of raw items


[25-Aug-24 10:27 AM] avalock#0000

[25-Aug-24 10:39 AM] avalock#0000
I did find some stuff for it, but like... it would mess with the chapter set up I have in my note app


[25-Aug-24 10:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
I had that for one of my actuarial exams recently. Nothing like actually wanting to study but not being able to


[25-Aug-24 10:39 AM] avalock#0000

I don't know how the math changes,  but ADI doesn't pay CX price on INS

Time for Linux on the desktop? 🙂


[25-Aug-24 06:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve been thinking of switching now that windows 11 is so dang annoying


[25-Aug-24 06:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just like Ubuntu or something stable and easy


[25-Aug-24 06:21 PM] igfloz#0000
I've tried various linux flavours, but never been committed to switching full time. Imma see if I can learn to cope with win 11 - BUT I aint gonna lie, I have now started of thinking of switching


[25-Aug-24 06:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have plenty of hard drives laying around, so sometime I might back up my PC and try it


[25-Aug-24 06:25 PM] igfloz#0000

Al is a first step in any expansion

[26-Aug-24 11:27 AM] laaxus#0000
but currently it's better (ROI WISE) to sell AU CU LI STL TI at bid price, than sellin AL at ask price


[26-Aug-24 11:27 AM] igfloz#0000
s'ok, I have one en-route (ship between Nascent and Deimos / Vulcan)


[26-Aug-24 11:28 AM] igfloz#0000
...as I don't have a Deimos base


[26-Aug-24 11:30 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Heavy import/export for most of these except maybe TI


[26-Aug-24 11:31 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
But ALO is just very easy to source, especially on Deimos


[26-Aug-24 11:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I can't see logistics be an issue once you have a high load cargo ship


[26-Aug-24 11:32 AM] jcheung#0000
Then produce those items 🙂


[26-Aug-24 11:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I will (once I get my high load cargo ship)


[26-Aug-24 11:32 AM] jcheung#0000
TI i can agree with you as being better than AL at least right now


[26-Aug-24 11:33 AM] jcheung#0000
LI i recommend building the smelter in situ at...


[26-Aug-24 11:33 AM] jcheung#0000
SE something


[26-Aug-24 11:34 AM] jcheung#0000
648?


[26-Aug-24 11:34 AM] jcheung#0000
Wherever the good TIO and O spot is, same system has LIO and HAL


[26-Aug-24 11:35 AM] jcheung#0000
Massively drops logistics


[26-Aug-24 11:35 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
AU is ~2300t export every day, that's basically a whole WCB. Other metals are also in the 1000s generally. You can manage many more lighter bases with one WCB


[26-Aug-24 11:35 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Metallurgy as a whole is just not peak of profit


[26-Aug-24 11:35 AM] jcheung#0000
AL is also just simply easy to get into as well


[26-Aug-24 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000
With a deimos base you can plop down SMEs and an EXT


[26-Aug-24 11:37 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

2 months ago it was the best, now I’m stuck with 40 Smelters worth of Al production


[26-Aug-24 11:43 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Predicted money/day/area of a dedicated base for that ticker from a script I wrote a while ago


[26-Aug-24 11:44 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Bigger number better


[26-Aug-24 11:44 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think there was a bug back then but the relative amount of money still stands


[26-Aug-24 11:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Very suprised by these numbers I must say


[26-Aug-24 11:44 AM] avalock#0000

Are you able to ship it? I’d buy some Alo if you can move it to Deimos or Vulcan

it would take a while probably awa

I’ll buy any you can bring on any of those planet anytime


[26-Aug-24 11:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can barely cover my need and I want to start building a buffer


[26-Aug-24 11:49 AM] avalock#0000
lmao valid yeah


[26-Aug-24 11:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m leaving for 2 weeks on vacation and I want it to keep churning


[26-Aug-24 11:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But both those bases would need 6k alo each for that


[26-Aug-24 11:50 AM] avalock#0000
yeah i probably can’t get you there


[26-Aug-24 11:53 AM] igfloz#0000
I can help out also, I regularly run to both Deimos & Vulcan

if i could change my company name, would definitely do puppy girl mining


[26-Aug-24 12:08 PM] avalock#0000
time to coliq


[26-Aug-24 12:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They let me change my company name because I had a misspelling without COLIQ


[26-Aug-24 12:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe they'll let you too


[26-Aug-24 12:11 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That be great. How do you want to work it? Wanna just let me know whenever you have stock there?


[26-Aug-24 12:11 PM] avalock#0000
lmao imma try


[26-Aug-24 12:11 PM] igfloz#0000
Can do, what's your priority ?


[26-Aug-24 12:11 PM] avalock#0000
if i can get puppy girl mining that would be sick


[26-Aug-24 12:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It's a more respectable title than Bober or Elon, they should have no objections


[26-Aug-24 12:15 PM] avalock#0000

[26-Aug-24 12:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, you can't get WOOF, but you can get something better?!? [ OOF ]


[26-Aug-24 12:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Idk if you can get WOOF, btw.

AUO should reduce to a fraction of its mass

when refined into AU


[27-Aug-24 11:49 AM] jcheung#0000

[27-Aug-24 03:05 PM] igfloz#0000
Sooooo..... We haven't discussed $$. What are you offering for my deliveries of ALO ?


[27-Aug-24 03:09 PM] igfloz#0000
1K ALO en-route to Deimos btw


[27-Aug-24 07:47 PM] tanda#0000
.... I don't have a plan for when the FLX runs out


[27-Aug-24 07:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve got a lot of LST and some CHPs - do we need extra FLX?


[27-Aug-24 07:55 PM] tanda#0000
there's only 4k FLX currently available on ASK orders starting at 200/unit


[27-Aug-24 07:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
Cool - I’ve got 996 LST at griffonstone right now, so I’ll just start making that into FLX and sell it here 🙂


[27-Aug-24 07:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
And maybe a bit for the CX, I suppose


[27-Aug-24 07:58 PM] tanda#0000
I appreciate you


[27-Aug-24 07:59 PM] jcheung#0000
I started a little bit of FLX prod too


[27-Aug-24 08:05 PM] tanda#0000
I appreciate you too


[27-Aug-24 08:26 PM] evany.#0000
I’ll be in the market for 1-2k flx in next couple of days too

you're waking up ? are you living in NA by any chance ?


[28-Aug-24 08:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
Florida


[28-Aug-24 08:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
I woke up an hour ago... Just got to my computer


[28-Aug-24 08:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
Also in continuation of Vic3 discussion... Performance will never be better unless they overhaul pop/building system


[28-Aug-24 08:06 AM] laaxus#0000
They could have improved it a lot by regrouping immigrant pop into one


[28-Aug-24 08:06 AM] laaxus#0000
there's not much difference between two discriminated population


[28-Aug-24 08:06 AM] marat_sh#0000
or just using single workforce pop for all buildings as %


[28-Aug-24 08:07 AM] laaxus#0000
anyway, it's not even the number of pops that is the issue


[28-Aug-24 08:07 AM] laaxus#0000
it's how they implement the rest


[28-Aug-24 08:07 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's just everything boils down to it


[28-Aug-24 08:07 AM] laaxus#0000
Any modern engine use ECS that is infinitly more performant than clausewitz


[28-Aug-24 08:07 AM] marat_sh#0000
clausewitz... ew


[28-Aug-24 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
Unity has an ECS, Unreal has an ECS ...


[28-Aug-24 08:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
with their development cycles We are not going to see new engine anytime soon


[28-Aug-24 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
If they can't develop it themselves then change engine


[28-Aug-24 08:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
they are not going to


[28-Aug-24 08:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's too interconnected


[28-Aug-24 08:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
we don't know how many other projects they are cooking that use old engine


[28-Aug-24 08:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
that would mean more delays


[28-Aug-24 08:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
they can't afford that 😅


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] laaxus#0000
I know


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] laaxus#0000
That's what I said I'm very worried about PDX futures


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] laaxus#0000
EU5 gonna be a big money makers


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] laaxus#0000
but after that IDK


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] marat_sh#0000
I think EU 5 will be the last big release


[28-Aug-24 08:10 AM] marat_sh#0000
after that DLCs


[28-Aug-24 08:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
we will see if they will decide to make a new engine


[28-Aug-24 08:11 AM] laaxus#0000
EU5 will use a pop system and will have 10 ticks a day


[28-Aug-24 08:12 AM] laaxus#0000
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG ??

{Reactions}
🤣 

[28-Aug-24 08:12 AM] laaxus#0000
(V3 devs were saying performance was fine before their horrible release)


[28-Aug-24 08:13 AM] marat_sh#0000
When Vic3 was dropped... I couldn't get to late game on my $3500 computer...


[28-Aug-24 08:24 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
EU4 is the game iv played the most in my life but sadly I feel like I’m passed sitting in front of games for that long. No longer have that time


[28-Aug-24 08:25 AM] laaxus#0000
know the feeling


[28-Aug-24 08:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
That feeling when you go from 6h of gaming to 2h


[28-Aug-24 08:25 AM] laaxus#0000
Sometimes I just want to play and then 10m in, I'm like "hell no, I've better things to do, I can't invest 10-15h"


[28-Aug-24 08:26 AM] laaxus#0000
It became very rare to me to feel like that


[28-Aug-24 08:58 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Makes me end up just replaying the same old games since I don’t have the time to learn and keep up with the updates


[28-Aug-24 09:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, it’s kinda surprising how many games I play that came out 10 years ago 😄


[28-Aug-24 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t know what I’ll do with my time if they shut down the servers for company of heroes 2. I still play it with friends all the time

I’m not saying you _should_ start now, but it’s a good RTS


[28-Aug-24 09:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
But for free, it’s definitely worth your time 😄


[28-Aug-24 09:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
Not a fan of RTS 😅


[28-Aug-24 09:41 AM] .urpalhal#0000

It was and still is, imo 🙂


[28-Aug-24 09:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
I still play with friends against bots a ton


[28-Aug-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
@jvaler can you remove my "Project Airlock" role? I can't text in trading chat probably because of it. Thank you ❤️


[28-Aug-24 10:27 AM] jvaler#0000
yup sorry about that


[28-Aug-24 10:28 AM] jvaler#0000
i always take it off but others seem to not


[28-Aug-24 10:31 AM] marat_sh#0000

Foxhole is great but better when playing with friends


[28-Aug-24 10:55 AM] laaxus#0000
+ I don't have so much time


[28-Aug-24 10:55 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, it sortof starts to drag, when you've involved in the larger groups.... and people start to drop off due to RL stuff, per week.


[28-Aug-24 10:56 AM] laaxus#0000
( <- the Guy that spent its last 4 days on excel sheets)


[28-Aug-24 10:56 AM] laaxus#0000
That Prun is slow is actually a positive point


[28-Aug-24 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
It makes progress all the more meaningful


[28-Aug-24 10:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Maybe the long, idling aspect of Prun, actually gives people some agency in their decisions, as compared to other games...


[28-Aug-24 10:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmmm, I've got weeks to try out some third-party tools, make a few spreadsheets, weight my options, execute and adjust? Rather than.... Hey y'all, we're trying out this really stupid, but really fun idea. Lets go! (all dead in the next 1-10 minutes).


[28-Aug-24 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
A fast pace game is about not making Bad decision


[28-Aug-24 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
A slow pace game, about making the best


[28-Aug-24 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
As every move matter


[28-Aug-24 11:00 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes.


[28-Aug-24 11:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, COH2 has been my go-to for a bit because it’s easy to spin up a game with friends and finish it in < 30 minutes. It’s just hard to get time to do more than that regularly


[28-Aug-24 11:52 AM] avalock#0000
the later is how i plan out my prun business

It's surprisingly hard to fail at Prun, unless you try to fail.


[28-Aug-24 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
yeee thats why i have no agency


[28-Aug-24 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
i just do what seems chill :3


[28-Aug-24 11:58 AM] laaxus#0000
And that's why it's a good game


[28-Aug-24 03:42 PM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah i never really gave instructions did i...


[28-Aug-24 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
@Project Coordinator when role-ing new players, please make sure to remove their airlock role and replace it with the associate/member role. to be clear, anyone with a base in antares gets member, and anyone without gets associate.

why is it so much


[28-Aug-24 07:34 PM] avalock#0000
honestly idk


[28-Aug-24 07:34 PM] avalock#0000
its really like


[28-Aug-24 07:34 PM] avalock#0000
28,000 if you have the secret information


[28-Aug-24 07:35 PM] jvaler#0000
🧐


[28-Aug-24 07:35 PM] avalock#0000
I think it has to do something with some of the custom bits, also prolly the pre-amps or something


[28-Aug-24 07:36 PM] avalock#0000
There's also a lot of cool IO connectors, and stuff


[28-Aug-24 07:36 PM] avalock#0000
idk it has a lot of features


[28-Aug-24 07:36 PM] avalock#0000
like


[28-Aug-24 07:36 PM] avalock#0000
sure


[28-Aug-24 07:36 PM] avalock#0000
I read the entire manual

he had me in the closet with the lines telling me to do something to them while he went around with the detector

mostly due to the metal in my body


[28-Aug-24 08:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
To detect the change in density from the outlet, not necessarily the wire


[28-Aug-24 08:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I mean the real answer would have been to withhold payment until it is fixed but I feel like we are beyond that point here


[28-Aug-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah we've been here for like 2 years now lol


[28-Aug-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
i think he did mention maybe trying that at some point


[28-Aug-24 08:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If the paint is still fresh you can just fucking punch holes in the wall and plaster over after as well


[28-Aug-24 08:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But at that point you really fucking want you outlets


[28-Aug-24 08:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ohhh


[28-Aug-24 08:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Trust me, I’m an engineer (expect for the part appart destroying the walls until you find them


[28-Aug-24 08:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I thought you meant the stud finder would find the wires

You may choose not to engage with politics, but politics engages with you every day by determining your rights and freedoms, your taxes, your surrounding economy, and your laws.

and if you encounter any young people who dont vote because *reasons*, tell them they are stupid motherfucking pieces of shit and the rest of the country hates them and their passivity while real problems happen while they live in their bubble.

(actually I think it's the huge number of contracts I accepted for Malahat)


[29-Aug-24 09:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Huh. Does it count deliverables as liabilities and payables as an asset?


[29-Aug-24 09:32 PM] tanda#0000
maybe?


[29-Aug-24 09:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
It must be if it’s because of the contracts. I guess it makes sense - you can either recognize the value of the contract when you accept it or when the individual payments / materials are delivered


[29-Aug-24 09:34 PM] tanda#0000

There's Snow White, and her dwarves. King Arthur's Court. Medieval kings (Richard the LIONHEART!).... LOTR names... Whatever suits your heart's desire! Of course, you could also pick some random German birth names... Stefan, Wolfgang, and more!

[31-Aug-24 01:25 PM] avalock#0000
ahhhh yeah understood


[31-Aug-24 01:26 PM] avalock#0000
I'm holding off on a new base for right now, or well atleast trying to


[31-Aug-24 01:26 PM] avalock#0000
I have too many material to move that I need to upgrade logistics


[31-Aug-24 01:26 PM] avalock#0000
and thats my main focus :3


[31-Aug-24 01:27 PM] tanda#0000
are you closing in on being able to afford your third ship yet?


[31-Aug-24 01:28 PM] avalock#0000
unfortunately not yet, I've been busy with like some other shtuff


[31-Aug-24 01:29 PM] avalock#0000
mostly base upgrade lmao, but after moving stuff, I should be able to sell a lot


[31-Aug-24 01:29 PM] avalock#0000
and that should be good for building a ship :3


[31-Aug-24 01:30 PM] tanda#0000
any thoughts on expanding beyond resource extraction?


[31-Aug-24 01:31 PM] avalock#0000
potentially smelting


[31-Aug-24 01:32 PM] laaxus#0000
What would you want to smelt ?


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] avalock#0000
ALO, or anything else I extract


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] avalock#0000
so far I got ALO and TIO


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] avalock#0000
my LIO is being used by others


[31-Aug-24 01:35 PM] avalock#0000
I also already extract O


[31-Aug-24 01:36 PM] tanda#0000
if you do get interested in doing AL smelting, I would be interested in buying your surplus at some point


[31-Aug-24 01:36 PM] tanda#0000
I'm considering another construction base and I would need more AL than I currently make


[31-Aug-24 01:36 PM] avalock#0000
:o


[31-Aug-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
At what price would you buy AL ?


[31-Aug-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
I do have a surplus, but I'm not selling it yet because it seems not worth it


[31-Aug-24 01:40 PM] tanda#0000
Ideally not at full market price? Whatever is fair


[31-Aug-24 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
that said, this is a future need, not one I have right now


[31-Aug-24 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
we will see atthat moment then


[31-Aug-24 01:43 PM] avalock#0000
is anyone selling MSL? :o


[31-Aug-24 01:49 PM] tanda#0000
you might want to bug Rise about that, see if he has one spare

[01-Sep-24 08:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
no... it's Recommended Dietary Allowance


[01-Sep-24 08:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in a group.

[01-Sep-24 10:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
you are the 'only' supplier of FLX on CX right now 😅


[01-Sep-24 10:03 AM] laaxus#0000
FLX is still not worth producing, even at ask price 😅


[01-Sep-24 10:04 AM] laaxus#0000
tho 300/u is a good roi


[01-Sep-24 10:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
at current LST price, I would say a "fair" price for FLX is 150/u


[01-Sep-24 10:23 AM] laaxus#0000

[02-Sep-24 08:16 AM] marat_sh#0000
I wish we could use FTL for in system jumps 🥲 8 hours from Heph to ANT and 10 hours from Nike to ANT


[02-Sep-24 08:16 AM] flor2081#0000
you can jump out and abort so you dont land on that planet, and then jump back in


[02-Sep-24 08:16 AM] flor2081#0000
sometimes that's faster


[02-Sep-24 08:16 AM] flor2081#0000
but you can check with BLU if thats really better


[02-Sep-24 08:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's just sounds not intentional 😅


[02-Sep-24 08:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am just yapping sorry 😅


[02-Sep-24 08:18 AM] flor2081#0000
there's some systems where you get like 5% damage if you move between far-away planets with STL so it's good that there's this option too hahah


[02-Sep-24 08:19 AM] marat_sh#0000

[04-Sep-24 04:33 PM] laaxus#0000
so I prefered to censor myself


[04-Sep-24 04:33 PM] igfloz#0000
I saw it....and it made sense to me (but I understand the censor)......... For me "Monster" is bad....period !


[04-Sep-24 04:34 PM] igfloz#0000
...it's always a bad decision


[04-Sep-24 04:34 PM] laaxus#0000
Water and hot water with leafs are the only correct decisions


[04-Sep-24 04:34 PM] avalock#0000
okay ill wait till the weekend to have it


[04-Sep-24 04:35 PM] avalock#0000
i have 12 cans of it i don’t wanna throw it out 😭


[04-Sep-24 04:36 PM] igfloz#0000
so .. beer is good right ? hot water and leafs ??


[04-Sep-24 04:36 PM] igfloz#0000
...but fermented


[04-Sep-24 04:36 PM] avalock#0000
what beer


[04-Sep-24 04:36 PM] laaxus#0000
" I bought this whole packs of food, but half of it is rotten. I still have to end it because I don't like throwing  food away"


[04-Sep-24 04:36 PM] avalock#0000
None of it is rotten thoooo


[04-Sep-24 04:37 PM] laaxus#0000
throwing away poison is not a loss


[04-Sep-24 04:37 PM] laaxus#0000
but you do you


[04-Sep-24 04:37 PM] igfloz#0000
I think his point is that it was already rotten when you bought it


[04-Sep-24 04:37 PM] avalock#0000

Looks like Anxuiz is trying to MM in the wrong spot


[05-Sep-24 10:11 PM] tanda#0000
I can blow through that buy in 3 days


[05-Sep-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000
you sold at 114


[05-Sep-24 10:12 PM] evany.#0000
you wild.


[05-Sep-24 10:12 PM] tanda#0000
that said it also looks like a market correction


[05-Sep-24 10:12 PM] tanda#0000
eh, when I listed that, the next highest seller was 115


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Did we ever settle on a price for Kevin?


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] evany.#0000
125 was target i think


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] tanda#0000
it looks like it's being prepped for transport to another CX


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] evany.#0000
so i wouldn't sell below 125


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, Amp does a lot of that sort of thing


[05-Sep-24 10:13 PM] evany.#0000
unless it was adi


[05-Sep-24 10:14 PM] tanda#0000
honestly? ADI doesn't buy from me much


[05-Sep-24 10:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
In a way, this is a success because it means Kevin INS is getting to other CXs - it’ll be interesting to see what they relist at


[05-Sep-24 10:14 PM] evany.#0000
idk you and i used to trade a ton


[05-Sep-24 10:14 PM] evany.#0000
i think it comes in waves


[05-Sep-24 10:15 PM] tanda#0000
but it does look like I need to assess how much this costs to make and adjust my internal price down


[05-Sep-24 10:15 PM] tanda#0000
I just lost a primary buyer in Razenpok, lol


[05-Sep-24 10:15 PM] tanda#0000
he stopped making REP


[05-Sep-24 10:16 PM] evany.#0000
did you let him know "no" sternly/


[05-Sep-24 10:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you wanna sell in bulk, I’d be happy to buy it and ship it to other CXs to undercut Amp 😛


[05-Sep-24 10:16 PM] tanda#0000
haha, I bet he has a bit of a stockpile of REP by this point. he was buying a lot


[05-Sep-24 10:17 PM] tanda#0000
That would be acceptable. I'll let you know if I get built up


[05-Sep-24 10:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
No pressure if you wanna hang onto it, but just in case you ever need to turn it into cash and don’t want to bother with the shipping yourself. I could also haul it for you if you’d prefer that and I’m making the trip 🙂


[05-Sep-24 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
I'm mostly just interested in it not being stagnant. Since we do have 4 producers right now, I'm planning in the next month or so to start producing HSE out of Nike as well


[05-Sep-24 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
shouldn't dent the INS much


[05-Sep-24 10:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am buying INS form CX Don't think I've bought it from you though


[05-Sep-24 10:23 PM] tanda#0000
I do offer an internal price of 110/unit


[05-Sep-24 10:23 PM] avalock#0000
Woof i might put AR on CX more


[05-Sep-24 10:24 PM] avalock#0000
idk how much that should affect INS prices but


[05-Sep-24 10:25 PM] tanda#0000
if I have to buy off CX I'll be fine, lol. If it's sitting around, it's just waiting to be listed


[05-Sep-24 10:25 PM] tanda#0000
I have buffer I gotta build back, I know everyone else is similar


[05-Sep-24 10:26 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee ihave 1k in aceland im holding gonna sell 1k on the market


[05-Sep-24 10:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
I will keep that in mind 😅 Price for INS is pretty nice so I saw no reason to get it cheaper then it's already is


[05-Sep-24 11:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah I was the 115 INS


[05-Sep-24 11:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Forgot we settled on 125


[05-Sep-24 11:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Hm


[05-Sep-24 11:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Or it was 115

#kevin-information


[05-Sep-24 11:21 PM] evany.#0000
I thought it was 125 but it does say 115

I stand very corrected

aceland came out of its technician slump


[06-Sep-24 01:14 AM] jcheung#0000
last time i looked it was at like 800 open tech jobs


[06-Sep-24 01:16 AM] jcheung#0000
also i think (forgot where aceland is and just closed out so i'm too lazy to open again) nike is closer to deimos anyways


[06-Sep-24 01:16 AM] jcheung#0000
which is a popular smelting area


[06-Sep-24 01:53 AM] razenpok#0000
I haven't stopped making REP; just reduced the production volume. I still need 157 INS/d, but not as much as 500+/d :kekw:

✅ 

[06-Sep-24 02:10 AM] razenpok#0000
Hmmm, even at REP 650 AIC/u it's still quite a good cash cow. I might return to it as I get more capital to invest

It’s just takes a bit to ship everything 😅


[06-Sep-24 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah. i have a good bit of spare shipping for the moment


[06-Sep-24 10:30 AM] marat_sh#0000
I send my ship empty to Nike, so if you guys need something (500/500) let me know


[06-Sep-24 10:31 AM] marat_sh#0000

Slavic train with hardbass
When a gopnik can't drive a lada, he uses this.

Song: XS Project- Vodovorot

The reason this exists is that the original one ( https://youtu.be/_HsWY43UY2U ) didn't have any hardbass.
This is an edit with the raw bouncing train video ( https://youtu.be/YtouEphiJNw ), and song by XS Project- Vodovorot.

Old school, late 90's, early 2000's game. Very decent for the solo-gamer. 🙂

Is northern forest the “very difficult terrain” start? That one is tons of fun


[12-Sep-24 06:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes it is 😃


[12-Sep-24 06:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s what I did for my most recent game - highly recommend

[12-Sep-24 06:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
I need to do some research on how to build before I start another play through


[12-Sep-24 06:27 PM] sidepipe#0000

[12-Sep-24 06:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[12-Sep-24 06:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
Northern forest forces you to build vertically


[12-Sep-24 06:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep - I had quite a few tall boxes 😄

[14-Sep-24 01:02 PM] riseoffilth#0000
you just gotta really be focused


[14-Sep-24 01:02 PM] riseoffilth#0000
my biggest issue is quickly going from 1 side of things type of production to another, constantly doing small upgrades. I just do sweeping large builds


[14-Sep-24 01:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but it loses out on minor production improvements, which add up than doing big builds at once, but take longer to steup

If you haven't, big recommend


[15-Sep-24 01:40 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I played it


[15-Sep-24 01:40 PM] getonthetrain#0000
very good, complex game


[15-Sep-24 01:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm still at like, the stage right before total war


[15-Sep-24 01:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But designing ships is awesome. I wish the skirmish mode was easier to use


[15-Sep-24 01:41 PM] getonthetrain#0000
what countries are your strongholds?


[15-Sep-24 01:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
EU, USA, and Kazakhstan my beloved


[15-Sep-24 01:41 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yes, same


[15-Sep-24 01:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Don't really need Kazakhstan anymore but it's nice


[15-Sep-24 01:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have a bunch of designs for ships I have in mind that I will try once I start striking back against ayyliens


[15-Sep-24 01:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Like a small ship covered in armor to deliberately smash into big ships


[15-Sep-24 01:43 PM] getonthetrain#0000
so many ways to play


[15-Sep-24 01:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
My normal ships all use coilguns though. I have small ships with PD and a nose coil cannon


[15-Sep-24 01:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
and then a big ship with nothing but small coilguns so it can throw a lot of shit at enemy PD


[15-Sep-24 01:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The DAKKAWAGON


[15-Sep-24 01:44 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I didn't build ships for the longest time to avoid the alien wrath


[15-Sep-24 01:44 PM] getonthetrain#0000
then bam


[15-Sep-24 01:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I haven't really done anything but kinetics


[15-Sep-24 01:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What are your ships like


[15-Sep-24 01:47 PM] getonthetrain#0000
its been awhile, I think I went plasma with UV lasers up close


[15-Sep-24 01:47 PM] getonthetrain#0000
kinetics are cool though, very human


[15-Sep-24 01:47 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
mhm


[15-Sep-24 01:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I like doing the galactic equivalent of throwing bricks at the enemy


[15-Sep-24 01:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
As opposed smarty-pants lasers or something


[15-Sep-24 01:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've tried it on my friend's computer... It was too complicated to understand in 2 hours


[15-Sep-24 01:48 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yes, it is. But very cool once you get it


[15-Sep-24 01:49 PM] getonthetrain#0000
its almost like 2 games in one


[15-Sep-24 01:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I researched plasma but then realized it's not really that much damage and I didn't upgrade my coilgun ships


[15-Sep-24 01:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I do have one ship per fleet with plasma cannons on flyswatting duty against any annoying fast alien ships trying to dodge all the bricks I am throwing


[15-Sep-24 01:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah even on 150% speed it's quite slow


[15-Sep-24 01:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And I like the space aspect much more than the Earth aspect


[15-Sep-24 01:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And there's a lot of stuff to learn. There's WAY too many mostly useless drives


[15-Sep-24 01:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think as a target, I researched 3


[15-Sep-24 01:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
Terra invicta is a ton of fun 😄


[15-Sep-24 01:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just wish a full game didn't take 200 hours


[15-Sep-24 01:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
True


[15-Sep-24 01:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
but it's really fun once you get into the stage where you can finally fight back.


[15-Sep-24 01:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You can speed it up but it's not a Civ game by any stretch of the imagination


[15-Sep-24 01:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I pissed off the aliens way too early last game, so my only space assets that survived were around mercury


[15-Sep-24 02:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
i always tend to back myself into a corner there anyway. the solar power is just too easy to rely on, and then you end up with fleets that take 6 months to get anywhere 😄


[15-Sep-24 02:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The aliens are pissed off at me right now and they are hitting some of my Earth stations but it's still not total war somehow


[15-Sep-24 02:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I am killing servants left and right, about my max control point cap and I am destroying servant habs and alien fleets when they come for me


[15-Sep-24 02:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Hopefully it stays that way for a bit longer so I can research a fancy fusion drive and make a doomstack


[15-Sep-24 02:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
i respect terra invicta for being the one game where you can build an orion drive


[15-Sep-24 02:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
they're impractical, but very cool


[15-Sep-24 02:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
i need to start another playthrough sometime - I kinda fell off the last one after I had to start fighting the aliens in the asteroid belt


[15-Sep-24 02:04 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I play! Love that game


[15-Sep-24 02:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah I'll probably play the Academy next


[15-Sep-24 02:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Currently doing resistance


[15-Sep-24 02:05 PM] riseoffilth#0000
EU best start while blocking USA


[15-Sep-24 02:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
Kazakhstan -> Israel (for the early game nuke) -> Americas -> US is my usual move


[15-Sep-24 02:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I took my sweeet time with the EU so everybody else defederated. Took a while to "convince" everybody to join up again


[15-Sep-24 02:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
the military budget of the US is just too powerful


[15-Sep-24 02:06 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I want them to mix HOI4 and Terra Invicta

I'd like the councilors to be less tedious. I just kinda leave them automated as much as I can

[15-Sep-24 02:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[15-Sep-24 03:53 PM] avalock#0000

[15-Sep-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000

[15-Sep-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
alr then


[15-Sep-24 03:54 PM] avalock#0000
well lmao i don’t wanna be too weird


[15-Sep-24 03:54 PM] tanda#0000
don't worry, we're all weird here


[15-Sep-24 03:54 PM] laaxus#0000
If I Hurt someone with words, the empathy and me trying to fix situation completely empty my social interaction battery

So I just say sorry preemptively


[15-Sep-24 03:54 PM] avalock#0000
*if only you knew how bad things were*


[15-Sep-24 03:54 PM] jvaler#0000
ur call, i wouldn't wanna force u to stay. but imo you'll be fine


[15-Sep-24 03:55 PM] avalock#0000
oh i mean i wanna stay lmfao


[15-Sep-24 03:55 PM] tanda#0000
safe to say the game we're all interested in playing is not attractive to non-neurodivergent individuals


[15-Sep-24 03:55 PM] avalock#0000
i just don’t wanna make others uncomfortable :3


[15-Sep-24 03:55 PM] jvaler#0000
you seem to know when to stop, and i can always remove things that actually are too much


[15-Sep-24 03:55 PM] avalock#0000
sounds good


[15-Sep-24 03:56 PM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, I'm confident that 19 out of 20 gamers I meet irl would not like this game


[15-Sep-24 03:57 PM] avalock#0000
you told me you don’t wanna do actual mod work or make new rules so i gotta respect that uwu


[15-Sep-24 03:58 PM] avalock#0000
waiting to find other players that bark as much as i do


[15-Sep-24 03:58 PM] avalock#0000
wruff


[15-Sep-24 03:59 PM] tanda#0000
you might be waiting a while


[15-Sep-24 03:59 PM] avalock#0000
lolol


[15-Sep-24 03:59 PM] tanda#0000
certainly won't be hearing that from me unless my mic's open. I live with two chihuahuas so I try to minimize the barking in my life


[15-Sep-24 04:00 PM] avalock#0000
i like to think when people find me in game or in a discord related to the game its just “Wtf is this person doing”


[15-Sep-24 04:00 PM] tanda#0000
I think it usually is


[15-Sep-24 04:00 PM] tanda#0000
but eventually it just transitions to: "Oh, that's just Avacyn"


[15-Sep-24 04:00 PM] avalock#0000
yeeeee


[15-Sep-24 04:00 PM] laaxus#0000
I like people being themself in public


[15-Sep-24 04:01 PM] laaxus#0000
I like that much more than all being the same and comply to social norms


[15-Sep-24 04:01 PM] avalock#0000
wait did i tell people here i hypnotized someone


[15-Sep-24 04:01 PM] tanda#0000
hopefully not accidentally?


[15-Sep-24 04:02 PM] avalock#0000
yeee i try not to be like the others


[15-Sep-24 04:02 PM] avalock#0000
nah it was all planned out


[15-Sep-24 04:02 PM] avalock#0000
im becoming a hypnotist for fun :3


[15-Sep-24 04:02 PM] avalock#0000
but yeah dude went into a trance and everything


[15-Sep-24 04:03 PM] tanda#0000
agreed, I have enough blandness in my life already


[15-Sep-24 04:03 PM] jvaler#0000
i've done my job in here once before so i'm okay with it now =P


[15-Sep-24 04:03 PM] avalock#0000
lmao sounds good :3


[15-Sep-24 04:04 PM] jvaler#0000
still don't wanna make a rules list yea, but i won't need to


[15-Sep-24 04:04 PM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, this community is so nice that it's hard to think there's anything to moderate


[15-Sep-24 04:04 PM] avalock#0000
but yeah i learned the steps and safety for hypnosis through… a very interesting community


[15-Sep-24 04:04 PM] jvaler#0000
hypnosis is real?


[15-Sep-24 04:05 PM] avalock#0000
sorta kinda


[15-Sep-24 04:05 PM] laaxus#0000
It is, but does not work for everyone


[15-Sep-24 04:05 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[15-Sep-24 04:05 PM] avalock#0000
also like… it isnt what it seems like in media


[15-Sep-24 04:06 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah you need to like fully trust someone or something right? but i don't get how it could even work


[15-Sep-24 04:06 PM] avalock#0000
like you still have autonomy when under hypnosis


[15-Sep-24 04:06 PM] avalock#0000
yup! trust is a huge part of it


[15-Sep-24 04:06 PM] laaxus#0000
I know someone that completely stopped smoking after a few hypnosis session


[15-Sep-24 04:07 PM] avalock#0000
i think its at some-part something along the lines of “hypnotee wanted to do it all along”


[15-Sep-24 04:08 PM] avalock#0000
i know people with… very interesting triggers…


[15-Sep-24 04:08 PM] jvaler#0000
i had assumed it was kinda like "turn your brain off" in a daydream kind of way


[15-Sep-24 04:09 PM] laaxus#0000
You need to want it to work, for it to work


[15-Sep-24 04:09 PM] laaxus#0000
It's like placebo on steroids


[15-Sep-24 04:09 PM] avalock#0000
nah :3 your brain is very active in hypno, its very tiring


[15-Sep-24 04:09 PM] avalock#0000
like even as the hypnotist


[15-Sep-24 04:10 PM] avalock#0000
my friend and i literally hung out in call for 2 hours partly cause i was making sure he was okay, and had a snack and water


[15-Sep-24 04:10 PM] avalock#0000
just talking about random stuff


[15-Sep-24 04:11 PM] avalock#0000
and then after i layed down for 3 hours lol


[15-Sep-24 04:11 PM] jvaler#0000

[15-Sep-24 04:14 PM] jvaler#0000
meow


[15-Sep-24 04:14 PM] jvaler#0000
so why do ppl do hypnosis?


[15-Sep-24 04:14 PM] avalock#0000
uhhhhh multiple reasons


[15-Sep-24 04:14 PM] avalock#0000
some do it for therapy (not me), some do it to help with relaxation (a bit of what i do), and then there’s a secret 3rd thing


[15-Sep-24 04:15 PM] avalock#0000
(also prob more)


[15-Sep-24 04:15 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[15-Sep-24 04:15 PM] avalock#0000
i like helping making others comfortable and feel protected


[15-Sep-24 04:16 PM] jvaler#0000
that's cute lol


[15-Sep-24 04:16 PM] avalock#0000
aaaa


[15-Sep-24 04:16 PM] laaxus#0000
Honestly I kinda hypnose myself throughout the day
I'd not call it hypnosis, but it's kinda the same thing from what I'm Reading

Hypnosis from hypnosist never worked on me tho


[15-Sep-24 04:17 PM] avalock#0000
yeah! reading and some other stuff is the same feeling as being in trance


[15-Sep-24 04:17 PM] avalock#0000
and that’s fair


[15-Sep-24 04:18 PM] avalock#0000
i have a hard time being a hypnotee cause i can’t visualize stuff


[15-Sep-24 04:19 PM] avalock#0000
but like thats why i like muscle based inductions and then im looking for other deepeners to help those with aphantasia :3


[15-Sep-24 04:19 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm going to sleep
GN everybody


[15-Sep-24 04:19 PM] avalock#0000

*New mic new mic new mic*


[15-Sep-24 04:22 PM] avalock#0000
yeee its just “what get”


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] avalock#0000
SM7b is like the “podcast/streamer” mic


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] avalock#0000
but


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] avalock#0000
RE20 is also a good speaking mic that reduces bass proximity effect


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] laaxus#0000
Don't buy blue yeti


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] avalock#0000
i already have one :P


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk anything about mics


[15-Sep-24 04:23 PM] laaxus#0000

[15-Sep-24 04:25 PM] avalock#0000

[15-Sep-24 04:25 PM] avalock#0000

[15-Sep-24 04:25 PM] avalock#0000
~~god i’m a dork~~


[15-Sep-24 04:26 PM] avalock#0000
i should make a pros cons list for mics…


[15-Sep-24 04:26 PM] avalock#0000
like what to get hmmmm


[15-Sep-24 04:26 PM] tanda#0000
spreadsheet time? spreadsheet time


[15-Sep-24 04:26 PM] avalock#0000

[15-Sep-24 04:27 PM] avalock#0000

POP totals for each tier * a tier multiplier.


[16-Sep-24 05:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
We can figure out the exact intervals, if 5 peeps, with different tiers of employment, contribute their workforce details.


[16-Sep-24 05:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's rather straightforward.


[16-Sep-24 05:57 PM] marat_sh#0000

feels like that might be coming for me before too long


[16-Sep-24 09:57 PM] jcheung#0000
i might, depending on how it's implemented


[16-Sep-24 09:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's pretty nice imo


[16-Sep-24 09:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
having to open CXPO buffers is annoying, but you can mitigate that by keeping a stock of most consumables (which is easy for me to do anyway since I usually send out 10 day increments)


[16-Sep-24 10:00 PM] jcheung#0000
i might have to dial my shit down a bit


[16-Sep-24 10:01 PM] jcheung#0000
aiming for 20 days, apparently that's not reasonable for a few of my bases 😅


[16-Sep-24 10:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, 20 days worth of AL for a construction base is a heavy lift 😄


[16-Sep-24 10:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
I try to keep 20 days at the base and resupply every 10 days as a general rule - some bases like demeter get 30 days because it's easier that way


[16-Sep-24 10:03 PM] tanda#0000
workforce consumables I always run 30 days. Keeps the hectic shipping to once a month


[16-Sep-24 10:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm hoping to get a bit more base-specific now that it's so easy with XIT ACTION ™️


[16-Sep-24 10:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
just been too lazy recently


[16-Sep-24 10:31 PM] jvaler#0000
i wanna use XIT ACTION rly badly but i can't figure out how i should make my shipping more standardized. i'm always needed to import different amounts of things


[16-Sep-24 10:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
different in terms of # of days per each thing?


[16-Sep-24 10:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
you could set up different groups with material exclusions in the same resupply - so you could do 30 days of consumables, 10 days of inputs. or there are manual ones, but I haven't touched those yet


[16-Sep-24 10:38 PM] jvaler#0000
like, for recipe inputs. consumables would be pretty simple


[16-Sep-24 10:38 PM] jvaler#0000
but a lot of logi constrained inputs don't line up how much fits in a ship vs how much is consumed per day


[16-Sep-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, that's fair


[16-Sep-24 10:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
i do have one manual one for SE-110b -> SE-110a. basically just load 150 each of MUS, MAI, VEG, and the rest with CAF


[16-Sep-24 10:43 PM] tanda#0000
I swear I saw lowstrife had a spreadsheet that generated xit actions for him


[16-Sep-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, you can do that. there's definitely a way to do strings -> XIT action


[16-Sep-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
i just never got all the burn stuff working in a sheet. consumables were easy, but not recipe inputs


[16-Sep-24 10:47 PM] jcheung#0000
can you set up a custom package of stuff to load?

[16-Sep-24 10:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
yea, you just need to add a 'manual' material group


[16-Sep-24 10:51 PM] jcheung#0000
so could "manually" figure out what you need for 10 day supply for a number of bases and daisy chain them together


[16-Sep-24 10:51 PM] jcheung#0000
top off the spare area with heavy stuff


[17-Sep-24 12:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000

Well, at current price levels, the tap water recipe is probably not viable anymore. The bottled water recipe still should be, due to PG supplies. Anyone who's growing food from market supplied Water, is likely going to have to stop short selling their produce.

Water consumption was slowly increasing (or production decreasing) and it got harder and harder for Vox's production to keep up. Then Blake / xepiov came in and bought out the whole supply and relisted it higher.

If OOG/ANT peeps haven't done this already... Establish private rates for those you know.

I'm entirely insulated from this BS, but that's just me.


[18-Sep-24 01:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
... Establishing private rates, with at bottom break-even prices, will let you know what you're dealing with, on the markets, at the very least.


[18-Sep-24 01:58 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I've done them... Others have as well for their own stuff... Heck.. Pretty much any base can have established break-evens, with long term averages, regarding the essential consumables.

The xepiov == ' hand / anointed / cherished ' -- in Greek.... I'm not letting that pass, and I've just made fun of them in UFO.... 

```
Teemed the markets with good, beyond payment of due source;
The devs, of fitful and beseeching could, made a bountiful course;

"To all of our backwater hoods, lend an ear to our witless hoarse;
May you fulfil your fiscal dreams, beholden by this coded force."

And so traders of old and new, sought exchange in the bourse;
Where they could reap tithes, of all that they could enforce.

Of old rocks, and things fancy anew, they all sought the things which held true;
Yet that spare drop of H2O which only few did screw, they all did truly whittle through.

Being that anointed hand of wonder, seeking lest, nothing of plunder;
Beseeching of all others to go under, from un-calculated and dismal blunder.

So high and mighty, did everyone sing; yet only to their hopes could they cling;
Their expectations they did truly bring; but what they had, at the wall they did fling.

And so the farmer of Hortus Prime, did decry of the market'ed crime;
"However shall I earn a pitiful dime, against this depraved and scoured slime?

All the ratings, they do climb?!

Yet what beholdens them, to those profits, sublime?!"
```

This goes into Adam Smith's 'Wealth of Nations'. Any "hidden hands", are unlikely to go past my erudition. I do not take exception to people making offhanded/historical gimmicks of other people's time, in places where I take time to consider/respond/take action.


[18-Sep-24 03:08 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Water rates, are unlikely to get serious to those who have insulated internal processes for H2O outputs.... 

However... at current rates, tap water (non-PG) DW processes should be untenable... Or something like it.... 

The only recourse is PG+ bottled water recipes... unless you have internal supply.. This is going to affect everyone who doesn't have that benefit, and is relying off-of Prunplanner rates to measure their metrics.

luckily, the censorship are less intense when you don't use english, i guess Elon forgot to hire moderators for other languages 😂

Dark fuel once said something about his pricing for nascent to Deimos on ufo or something

I think you can get LMOS through FIO


[21-Sep-24 11:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
... Yep, pretty much... His pricing is that, since COGC pipelines usually have lots of goods entering/exiting a planet, but nothing on the reverse side... Fuel costs for the larger ships, for just a few jumps out, are like 10k fuel + depreciation.


[21-Sep-24 11:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's just to get to the destination, from a CX.


[21-Sep-24 11:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
+ the return trip.

[21-Sep-24 11:35 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
~10k AIC or something like it... He'd be making then, 20k AIC for the trip, lasting like ~3-4 days. The returns on shipping are paltry, compared to the capital investment required.


[21-Sep-24 11:36 AM] tanda#0000
no kidding


[21-Sep-24 11:37 AM] tanda#0000
I'm paying as much on transport contracts as I am on fuel


[21-Sep-24 11:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So at best, you'd get like 40k AIC profit, using a ship, on the longer runs, for the entire week. Any new base pays out more in the same period.

Yeah for sure, looking at a shipping contract really is like, is it something you can pick up on the way to do something you're already doing, and it'll fit with what you're carrying? Great, you got a partial fuel refund


[21-Sep-24 12:37 PM] kynadre#0000
otherwise it's really difficult once you actually crunch the #s to even break even on a round trip, from what I'm seeing so far

you gotta be quick when someone drops a worthwhile contract, you don't see them 'cause they are usually taken quickly

who let people name these? 😄


[21-Sep-24 06:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
> Cummingtonite was named after the town of Cummington, Massachusetts, where it was discovered in 1824.[6][2][3] It is also found in Sweden, South Africa, Scotland, and New Zealand.

well, for the record, I was thinking more of those iron ores like Hematite, cassiterite, etc. but I guess you have some flexibility with this naming schema

I really chose the wrong major to not **love** physics


[21-Sep-24 07:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
physics is what drove me away from engineering, personally 😄


[21-Sep-24 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well like I’ve done fine till now


[21-Sep-24 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
My only C was in physics 2


[21-Sep-24 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And now I’m taking a class that is basically just physics 2 but with more math that I don’t remember either


[21-Sep-24 07:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
they made phsyics 2? 😱


[21-Sep-24 07:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
wasn't the first one enough?


[21-Sep-24 07:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I had to take two semesters of physics


[21-Sep-24 07:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Physics 1 and Physics 2


[21-Sep-24 07:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Newtonian Physics and kinematics was physics 1


[21-Sep-24 07:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And physics two was EM and circuits and Modern Physics mind fuckeryv


[21-Sep-24 07:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
modern physics implies the existence of ancient physics 😛


[21-Sep-24 07:09 PM] sidepipe#0000

[21-Sep-24 07:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Classic physics is like gravity and kinematics


[21-Sep-24 07:10 PM] sidepipe#0000

The advanced math classes I took are the one thing I am really glad to be done with. Like I'd go back and take any of my csci classes again, those were all pretty fun. But my Calc 1, Calc 2, Linear Algebra were all super tough


[21-Sep-24 07:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Math is hard stuff sometimes


[21-Sep-24 07:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I had a really good math teacher, but she would say "I love teaching an 8 am class, because it's the only time when you can make students come in earlier than the class time. Because all the other slots they might have classes before that one"


[21-Sep-24 07:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I was there at 7:30 every class period because she would either go over the homework, or if it was a test day, she'd let us start the test early (which was sort of essential)


[21-Sep-24 07:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just never had the heart to tell her none of us like being there early 😛


[21-Sep-24 08:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well


[21-Sep-24 08:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
see, the advanced math /stats was the only thing I wasn't happy to be done with. but my major was a lot of business and accounting stuff which barely even felt like learning


[21-Sep-24 08:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
When I was a young lad 8 AM classes weren’t so bad


[21-Sep-24 08:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh yeah my csci classes all had a bit of "do whatever projects you want as long as it's related to the class"


[21-Sep-24 08:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am really curious what you'd learn in a "business" class, cause I do "business stuff" all the time at work and I have no idea how business works


[21-Sep-24 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
"doing business" is like "military intelligence"

lol, that's always what it feels like, but the way some people are into it, it makes me feel like I'm missing something


[21-Sep-24 08:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Specifically I guess "project management". Cause I've worked with a lot of project management and business dev people at different contracts and they never really do the same thing, and I'm not sure how to describe any of it, really

project management is a fun one. at the best, it can be really helpful to have someone who is looking at the big picture of a project and can help communicate issues and stuff like that. but at the worst, it's a religious adherence to 'six sigma' and 'kanban' without explaining or applying any of those, and a whole lot of extra bureaucratic work

[21-Sep-24 08:22 PM] evov#0000
I think one of the issues with the perception of managers in general.... the core of the position is typically holding a middle ground between different groups of interested parties ( Staff/ Customers / Owners / Suppliers etc etc ) And they have to constantly make tradeoffs between competing interest... which is why from the perspective from any ONE of the interested groups, the decisions made by look dumb.. or at least dumb adjacent.


[21-Sep-24 08:23 PM] jcheung#0000
And most of the tradeoffs are usually skewed to make them appear to perform better to the next in the chain of command


[21-Sep-24 08:24 PM] evov#0000
Unfortunately, because of the grey waters managers are forced to swim in.... sometimes it's also a convenient place for poor performance to remain undetected for a while.


[21-Sep-24 08:25 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure there's a few people that don't do that, but ive had at least one of these people in every chain of management I've ever seen


[21-Sep-24 08:25 PM] jcheung#0000
Also the fact that people are promoted into incompetence doesn't help


[21-Sep-24 08:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. I feel like the general rule is that there's a lot of systems (like project management for example) that are supposed to help you do a job, but some people kinda miss that and the system ends up becoming the job


[21-Sep-24 08:29 PM] tanda#0000
I guess we really can't call that the Dilbert principple anymore, huh


[21-Sep-24 08:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
if that makes any sense


[21-Sep-24 08:34 PM] evov#0000
It makes a lot of sense. People mistake increased authority with being more "critical" to a process/operation. Might be true sometimes, but more often than not it isn't, and in my experience, better managers are often the ones that correctly recognize that the role is a support role. It's lubricant for the machine rather than being an essential cog within it.

[21-Sep-24 11:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the Book of Mormon is only one of many canon books in their theology though I think


[21-Sep-24 11:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
there's some wild stuff in there


[21-Sep-24 11:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
pretty fascinating


[21-Sep-24 11:12 PM] tanda#0000
sure, I grew up in the SDA. We had like 8 books in addition to the bible that was canonical


[21-Sep-24 11:13 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
had a very long conversation with a religions professor who was mormon years ago and it was kinda wild. Like, I have a lot of mormon friends who are really smart and wonderful people, but the whole history surrounding Joseph Smith is pretty unhinged


[21-Sep-24 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yeah that is a whole can of worms


[21-Sep-24 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
some say daming some say not


[21-Sep-24 11:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
a super interesting can of worms I'll admit though


[21-Sep-24 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but JS saying Jesus failed is a new one


[21-Sep-24 11:15 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah IDK, I know there are a lot of beliefs about Jesus specifically that contradict the better known Christian teachinigs, but it's been ages since I researched all that


[21-Sep-24 11:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
there's a lot of apologetics too


[21-Sep-24 11:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but I was more interested in the Jesus failing bit bc idk that's pretty controversial


[21-Sep-24 11:18 PM] avalock#0000
i don’t get into debates about religious stuff anymore, i had “i’m 12 years old and i’m an athiest who’s here to ruin your day” phase

lol yeah religion can be a very hot and touchy subject. I have had some really good convos about it tho.


[21-Sep-24 11:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I find a lot of theological debates fascinating from the outside, but I don’t really have a stake in them personally 😄


[21-Sep-24 11:20 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee i love listening to people talk about their beliefs and ideology, typically i let it be one sided and get them to explain stuff further


[21-Sep-24 11:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I might have taken a world religion course


[21-Sep-24 11:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it is very fascinating since religion has had such a impact (both good and bad) on our world and the various cultures around

yeeee


[21-Sep-24 11:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[21-Sep-24 11:33 PM] evov#0000
One of the things I love about discussions in online communities / gaming communities etc.. is that everyone's argument has to stand on it's own two feet. It kind of removes the "Im right because I'm old/richer/smarter/more experienced" etc. Either your statements are well reasoned, or they're not.

Plus, I think anonymity is an important element of true honesty sometimes.

can you toss me a random song in opus from your list? I'm just gonna trust that it won't do anything bad to my computer 😄


[23-Sep-24 08:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
just wanna test that this command I found works before I send you to install all of ffmpeg


[23-Sep-24 08:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
or toss me a link to one on youtube and I can download it from there 🙂


[23-Sep-24 08:39 PM] jvaler#0000

[23-Sep-24 08:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
okay, so I think I've found a way to do it, but it requires compiling ffmpeg from source so it might not be worth it 😦


[23-Sep-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
idek what that means lol


[23-Sep-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000

[23-Sep-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
it's alr though, i'm sure i can figure something else out


[23-Sep-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
ty for trying


[23-Sep-24 08:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
it was worth a shot. I looked in my downloads folder and found it's been 3 months since I last installed ffmpeg to do something like this 😄


[23-Sep-24 08:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
you may be able to get your download program to get them all in AAC in the first place, at least according to some googling around I did


[23-Sep-24 08:59 PM] jvaler#0000
OH

[23-Sep-24 10:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its organic?


[23-Sep-24 10:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
you could pave the hill. but it'll take a bunch of time and be annoying, and you could spend that time making things that make things


[23-Sep-24 10:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
at least, that's what I tell myself whenever I run into that situation


[23-Sep-24 10:08 PM] sidepipe#0000

The phrase "baby steps" comes to mind. Pacing something that's difficult, breaking it down into several phases with permission to take a break between phases... that can be extremely important


[26-Sep-24 04:09 PM] kynadre#0000
also some eating problems here I learned are from lactose and fructose intolerance, whee! Thank God there's pills for that.


[26-Sep-24 04:10 PM] kynadre#0000
most people don't realize lactose intolerance is a thing too, but like, when something messes you up, keep track, there may be a pattern...

[26-Sep-24 07:10 PM] jcheung#0000

[26-Sep-24 08:33 PM] evov#0000
Last week I added an AL swimming pool to my space base. This week, I thought I'd try to be a bit more cultired and not do something as silly as that.

So I built a wine cellar. Come round for drinks friends!

I threw up an LM shipping contract last minute and someone grabbed it thankfully


[26-Sep-24 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
Can i help?


[26-Sep-24 08:40 PM] kynadre#0000
idk how you'd help, it's really just me needing to do better calculations on travel time and how many trips I needed to make to my own base


[26-Sep-24 08:41 PM] jcheung#0000
Depending on what you're hauling i can turn between 2 and 6 trips for you into 1 trip for me


[26-Sep-24 08:42 PM] kynadre#0000
It's just one trip for me, I'm already 2hr from station to deliver the first of the 2 contracts, but I do appreciate the offer


[26-Sep-24 08:42 PM] kynadre#0000
my stuff taking more time with one ship is no big deal, I just needed to send my other ship out to do contracts sooner than I did originally


[26-Sep-24 08:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Eh. Sure.


[26-Sep-24 08:44 PM] kynadre#0000
like basically I accepted two round-trip contracts, I'm 95% done with the first of the two round trips


[26-Sep-24 08:44 PM] kynadre#0000
so I'm pretty much on my way to take care of the 2nd within 3 hours, I just needed to have started my original trip sooner


[26-Sep-24 08:44 PM] kynadre#0000
Thank you though :pandaheart:

the towels don't really get into all the nasty nooks and crannies of the washer

Isn't the detergent washing both ?


[27-Sep-24 11:41 AM] jcheung#0000
no, washing uses detergent


[27-Sep-24 11:41 AM] jcheung#0000
the detergent isn't performing the washing


[27-Sep-24 11:41 AM] jcheung#0000
it's a consumable, like the water

Dear employees of the DST family,

I am thrilled to announce that, thanks to your hard work and dedication, we have achieved record-high profits this last week and, for the first time in this company history, we maintained over 1 million AIC in liquidity for 7 consecutive days. This is a remarkable milestone, and it reflects the commitment, innovation, and resilience you all bring to the company every day.

While we celebrate this success, we must also stay focused on the future. To maintain our competitive edge, we are reinvesting in key areas such as construction, chemistry, as well as mining. These investments will ensure our long-term growth and sustainability in an ever-changing market.

As we look ahead, we also recognize that financial prudence is essential. Given the current economic landscape, we have decided not to implement salary increases at this time. However, we remain committed to evaluating compensation strategies and ensuring they reflect both market conditions and individual performance in the long run.

Thank you for your ongoing commitment. The future is bright, and I’m confident that together we will continue to achieve even greater success.

Laaxus,
DST CEO

I may have to consider selling stuff soon. Either that or admit that I have a (buying stuff off the CX) addiction.

Sum of my CX trades over the last 6ish weeks

just sell your stuff but overpriced


[27-Sep-24 05:58 PM] laaxus#0000
if you sell any stuff, you would earn much more money than you should, and you would stabilize market at the same time

it's a win win


[27-Sep-24 05:59 PM] evov#0000
Yea, over that time period - my cash reserves have fallen by about 132mil. Warehouse stock up by like 260mil. Built a few ships, can't remember when I did my last HQ upgrades, but they're probably included in that time period as well, so it all ballances out.


[27-Sep-24 06:00 PM] evov#0000
And a decent chunk of cash comes in via ship sales that are contracted rather than CX.. so numbers don't capture that.

Its that time of the month again... No not that time. Time to find more new players to fill the ranks of the evil ship building empire.

Are you new? Want free stuff, in exchange for your unwavering loyalty and to be part of a faceless and endless beurocratic ship building machine? This is the opportuntity youve been waiting for!

Jokes mostly aside, looking for folks to fill some roles and bases. I'm looking to give out FREE bases to new players, or even mid-game players to create reliable supply chains with reliable partners.(you must have pro for once a week contracting) I need some Extraction bases, some chemistry bases, a manufacturing base or 2, and maybe a smelting base? Prices in and out are fixed, about 45-50k profit per day.

DM me if interested!

wym specs regarding an oil change? how do you have an oil change without changing the oil lmao


[07-Oct-24 03:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Dealer changed oil filter... But any oil was not replaced.... I found out when fam complained that the car's computer was complaining about something... I checked... Basically 1/10th of the required oil was in the pan when non-idling... I followed up with some BS chatter with some supervisor at the dealership, at the time; they quoted me with some time-out relationship, that was not pertaining to the issue at hand, per previous sale agreements.


[07-Oct-24 03:05 PM] kynadre#0000
Holy crap that's bad. I mean, full context, you have to drain the oil to change the filter. I hope it didn't do permanent damage!

Also the lack of awareness of how serious those injuries can be, how important urgent attention to them is, due to lack of life experience in general. That is a factor, a significant factor

we work with the reality which we're given, and the influence and education we have, if any, to attempt to change it for the better. Alas, "better" is a subjective term besieged by many who seek to "better" their own situations at the expense of others, and balancing these for the greater good is in the midst of massive tug of wars between parties with much more power of influence

This was my perspective up until my mid 20's. As I got older I gradually reversed that opinion.
As with most things though - kind of depends on what you mean by "smart"

I think a lot of "smart" people tend to over-value the importance of iq/capacity for logic/reason... and undervalue the importance of subject matter knowledge. I do get the irony and obvious bias with this statement... but.....  The more experienced I get, the more I recognize the value of experience.

nothing good on the ROG forum - kinda don't think its an option. Even if you use the bloatware, it will still be detected as a controller, in e.g. Steam or Epic maybe ? - I read in the forum that steam has it's own controller settings ?

[09-Oct-24 03:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
@evov I want to continue conv here instead of AGP chat


[09-Oct-24 03:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
what $ do you buy KV for?


[09-Oct-24 03:04 PM] evov#0000
Well, generally speaking, those deals I offered everyone - were intended for the new players just getting started. I can't remember the specifics - but I think I provided all the inputs needed, delivered them to the planet, and paid 600k now for delivery of 100 KV when they get made. So I guess I'm paying 6k per Kevlar for the "permit+consumes+repairs" component of the product.


[09-Oct-24 03:07 PM] evov#0000
Not needing to worry about shipping means their ships are still free to expand into other things (people are very logistics constrained early with just 2 starter ships). And getting cash up front (600k in this case) means they're able to actually build/expand their base much much much faster than someone who's buying inputs, shipping to base, making stuff, shipping to CX, waiting for products to sell.


[09-Oct-24 03:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
What If I have my own way to supply stuff... I am just want to know what 'fair' price would be for KV... Like I am looking at your DCM BID order and I don't think it's 'fair' price since PSM sells at 2000+ range


[09-Oct-24 03:13 PM] evov#0000
Well, I don't think having cash sitting on the CX waiting around aimlessly hoping someone will fill the order is a great use of capital - so it's only worth doing if A. It's going to get filled quickly. or B. It's juicy when it does get filled.


[09-Oct-24 03:14 PM] evov#0000
PSM - yea I'd give you 2k /unit for as much as you want to make.


[09-Oct-24 03:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
The way I see it that PSM is more valued as it is then in DCM if it drops in value


[09-Oct-24 03:16 PM] evov#0000
No idea what the prices on the CX look like at the moment. But yeah, I use PSM in much larger volumes than DCM


[09-Oct-24 03:18 PM] evov#0000
At the moment I have 43 PPF's running. (I did have 23, but found it wasn't enough to keep up) I suspect 43 is more than I need. So if I kill off one base to use the permit elsewhere, and make up the gap with CX orders, probably makes more sense than buying another permit for 70mil


[09-Oct-24 03:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
Problem with "Tier 2" items that people have their own production and don't want to get rid of if it there is not as much production on CX as they already have, but new players can't output that much at the begining and have to save up until they can


[09-Oct-24 03:21 PM] evov#0000
Slowly - more items are being added into the "regularly traded comodity" basket.


[09-Oct-24 03:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
for sure... It's a slow process and in 80+ days I am playing more and more items are being traded on CX


[09-Oct-24 03:22 PM] evov#0000
When I started making Afabs - I felt like I needed to make my own CL because the markets just weren't devoloped enough yet. Now - I feel like I can comfortably lean on the markets for EPO/PG etc


[09-Oct-24 03:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
We will all get there Just need a bit of patience


[09-Oct-24 03:24 PM] evov#0000
But yea, for me... the things on the chopping block at the moment are my POL's (PG/EPO production) and maybe 1 of my PPF bases. (which really hurts because I only just got 5 experts on that thing recently, so tearing it down feels bad )


[09-Oct-24 03:25 PM] marat_sh#0000
Probably the PPF if you wanna give it to new bros. New demand for PG will drive up the price for it


[09-Oct-24 03:28 PM] evov#0000
If you (or anyone really) is looking to start making PPF stuff. I'll buy a base worth of production at PSM - 2.2k   PSL - 3.7k


[09-Oct-24 03:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
I make ~450 PSM per week and all of it is being sold 💀


[09-Oct-24 03:34 PM] evov#0000
But yeah, that's my plan basically. Slowly start buying up from the CX till I've got a comfortable stockpile - THEN shut down half my PPF production. I just can't afford to run into a situation where the CX's are empty and I need to be building ships!


[09-Oct-24 03:50 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Honestly, I haven't expanded my PPF because of the uncertainty of long term demand. If you are needing more, I can expand


[09-Oct-24 03:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
Not a lot of people use BIDs unfortunatly


[09-Oct-24 03:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's hard to see if there is demand or not


[09-Oct-24 03:51 PM] getonthetrain#0000
the market will work better if it was more used, I believe


[09-Oct-24 03:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
I wish you could place BID and it would only take $ from your account if someone sold it to you


[09-Oct-24 03:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
Giving like 1mil for BID when it could be used now is kinda dumb


[09-Oct-24 03:52 PM] getonthetrain#0000
probably some way to go into debt to the CX if that was the case


[09-Oct-24 03:52 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and if you are in debt, no more buying until its cleared up


[09-Oct-24 03:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeap


[09-Oct-24 03:54 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and a way to check your "funds allocated to CX bids" so you can ensure you are keeping enough available


[09-Oct-24 03:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
It would be way flexable to still have that money available and get BID slowly filled


[09-Oct-24 03:54 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yes, you wouldn't expect 100% of your bids to be filled in such a short time frame, usually


[09-Oct-24 03:55 PM] getonthetrain#0000
just keep enough of a buffer for normal volume, and still be able to use half that money or something


[09-Oct-24 03:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
I believe all of it should be available with just warning if you gonna spend more then you have allocated for BIDs


[09-Oct-24 03:56 PM] getonthetrain#0000
oh sure, its up to the player to have it at a level of risk they want


[09-Oct-24 03:56 PM] evov#0000
In some ways, Local Markets are better in this respect. You can put up buy orders, and you're not paying until the contact gets accepted. The CX holds onto a lot of cash.


[09-Oct-24 03:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
My problem with LM it's not as flexible as CX and not everyone is using them


[09-Oct-24 03:57 PM] evov#0000
Yea. It's a tradeoff.


[09-Oct-24 03:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
Like I haven't seen any LMs on Heph that are not items that people forgot to bring with them or fuel 😅


[09-Oct-24 03:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
Plus I don't really want people use them either since there is no sorting system or search system


[09-Oct-24 04:01 PM] evov#0000
Some systems it seems fairly active on. Boucher for example - plenty of people looking to buy H2O at a discount there and handle the shipping themselves. Makes life easier for people wanting to produce it but can't handle the shipping yet.


[09-Oct-24 04:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
It's a herd syndrome


[09-Oct-24 04:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
People saw using it and they also use it


[09-Oct-24 04:03 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Is there a way to see LMs without checking each planet individually?


[09-Oct-24 04:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't think so


[09-Oct-24 04:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have panel open for LM on the planets I am on


[09-Oct-24 04:04 PM] getonthetrain#0000
What is needed is a way to check LMs for all planets in a system or area - with a filter if you just want a certain planet


[09-Oct-24 04:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
Still I don't like the UI for LM


[09-Oct-24 04:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
would love to see simplified CX UI for LM


[09-Oct-24 04:05 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Let me see all LM ads within 2 jumps of Antares CX - then filters available to sort it out


[09-Oct-24 04:05 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Not too hard to make that I would think


[09-Oct-24 04:06 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and that origin location being player input to search


[09-Oct-24 04:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
There needs to be QoL update at some point... Like selecting multiple items for contract

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Oct-24 04:09 PM] getonthetrain#0000
oh yes, why can't a player open a "box" within your warehouse and put everything you want into it and then select that box for a shipping contract?


[09-Oct-24 04:10 PM] getonthetrain#0000
that box being able to tell you how much t/m3 it is


[09-Oct-24 04:10 PM] getonthetrain#0000

[10-Oct-24 09:59 PM] jcheung#0000
if i did my math right, it should cost about thiiiis much

[10-Oct-24 10:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
i think your formula is overestimating the later levels if I read it right

cost


[10-Oct-24 10:12 PM] jcheung#0000
actually off by 2* i meant off by one level

yikes, but I suppose you have to account for the levels inbetween 6->7 and 10->11


[10-Oct-24 10:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
what do the cost factors look like for start levels 0 to 10?


[10-Oct-24 10:16 PM] jcheung#0000
...i wonder if it actually properly handles 0


[10-Oct-24 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000

here we go


[10-Oct-24 10:44 PM] jcheung#0000
FLOOR( endLevel * ( endLevel / 2 ) / 2 ) - FLOOR( startLevel * ( startLevel / 2 ) / 2 ) + if(startLevel = 0, 1, 0)


[10-Oct-24 10:45 PM] jcheung#0000

So I had a wifi card with a realtek chip in it but the drivers were mega Garbo and messing with my connectivity, so I got a different card from TP link with a intel chip in it, but the intel chip was using the realtek drivers not the intel drivers and so it was having even worse internet connection issues

would you like me to take photos of them?


[19-Oct-24 02:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
up to you! i've got a pretty good amount to look at here - this window faces west, so they really like to hang out here


[19-Oct-24 02:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think smaller + redder is ladybug, where the larger brownish-red ones are the other kind?

@manhim I saw your post in https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1246820458356150335/1297659413993099325


[20-Oct-24 03:40 PM] igfloz#0000
I am already supplying ALO for someone @ Deimos and I have 4K ALO on the CX. What price are you thinking of for ALO?


[20-Oct-24 03:50 PM] manhim#0000
I have open orders for 75 AIC per units of ALO on Nascent, I usually transport myself from extraction. I could raise my costs a little bit, but it wouldn't make sense not to extract it myself if I pay much more than that.


[20-Oct-24 03:50 PM] igfloz#0000
hmmmm, yeah 75  is too low for me, sorry

lol, I can't disagree, you aint wrong


[24-Oct-24 05:44 AM] cruelcoin#0000
The biggest ballache is knowing what new buffer you want, what you want to see, knowing that it exists because it must do, and not being able to find it, because the UI expects you to memorise a bunch of codes rather than being properly accessible.


[24-Oct-24 06:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just tell them to go play Eve, and do industry only. Lots of third party tools, wikis, and if you want to access info in game, you're going to be hopping from one buffer window to another... It's sounds vaguely familiar to PrUn, so maybe they'll get some applicable "hands-on experience" from a game that has not only industry, PVE/PVP content, but also microtransactions and gambling. 🙂


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
There are 3 commands that one must remember : CXM, MAT, BUI


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
It's ok


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
the rest of the commands comes from the tutorial


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
if people skip on the tutorial, that's on them


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
or one could just type HELP (or whatever that command was)


[24-Oct-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[24-Oct-24 07:27 AM] tanda#0000
man I can't imagine having to survive without CXM


[24-Oct-24 07:28 AM] tanda#0000
early on it's kinda pointless since CXPC and CXOB are pretty robust for a single market application, but trying to keep tabs on trends in several markets would require like 15 more clicks


[24-Oct-24 07:28 AM] tanda#0000
sometimes I forget it's a PRO feature too


[24-Oct-24 07:56 AM] razenpok#0000
There's one command that one must remember: COLIQ :blobsunglasses:


[24-Oct-24 07:56 AM] razenpok#0000
Wait, cxm is a pro feature?


[24-Oct-24 07:56 AM] razenpok#0000

Don't worry. The free CX command is more overpowered than the CXM command is; an example:

i find CX tiles clumsy and slow


[24-Oct-24 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
it's way faster to just type what MAT ticker's CXPC/CXOB/CXPO buffer you need than navigating the CX tile. the category dropdown, scrolling, and searching make it slow

I always do that and I am pretty surprised other people have a different workflow


[24-Oct-24 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
A few things the devs had said make me think they don't expect users to be typing mats in, and instead always navigating by clicking


[24-Oct-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you type `CXOB RaT.AI1` or `CXOB RAT.ai1` you get eternally spinning error messages. But if you type `CXOB FOO.AI1` it tells you that's an invalid mat.


[24-Oct-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
And they were like "who is typing into buffers????"


[24-Oct-24 01:49 PM] igfloz#0000

[24-Oct-24 04:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Some buffer functions are case-specific... Others aren't... Like (if you could)... Type in cXoB RaT.aI1... and you'd be fine... (you won't be fine).... Other like for the MAT/BUI... Type in RaT/rAt/Rat... etc... even for the BUI versions, and you'll be perfectly fine.


[24-Oct-24 04:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A collection of case-specific syntax definitions, for ALL the CMDS buffer commands, would be a nice addition to the community. I'd contribute a few hundred thousand credits for it, myself alone.

they have done map color updates before i think... but accumulators have always been grey afaik


[25-Oct-24 03:51 PM] jvaler#0000
the issue seems to be the triple wide accumulator columns


[25-Oct-24 03:51 PM] jvaler#0000
cause it's 98 accumulators tall and it adds up to like 1200 lol

I have a question to Kevin people... your goal is 115/u for INS right? Why not sell it at that price? Maybe I don't understand something ( I am not attacking anyone just asking )


[28-Oct-24 05:33 PM] marat_sh#0000

[28-Oct-24 05:41 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm not part of it, but probably because overall production is too low

Yeah, but Pi supplies all CXs


[28-Oct-24 05:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
not just ANT


[28-Oct-24 05:45 PM] igfloz#0000
...and you're probably making a good sum of $$ off it. I also make EXO and very rarely offer on the CX. I know, I know - I'm losing opportunity, but I offer for a decent price for discerning buyers (which is not the point of your question)


[28-Oct-24 05:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
Oh that makes sense


[28-Oct-24 05:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
so even with everyone combined, we don't have enough production to keep prices at 115


[28-Oct-24 05:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeap, that would be the answer Thanks 😅

also, neat, red and green wire don't cost anything anymore


[29-Oct-24 07:29 AM] jvaler#0000
quality on intermediates is just useful for crafting into other things


[29-Oct-24 07:30 AM] jvaler#0000
ngl i'm not touching quality until i get at least t2 modules and recycling


[29-Oct-24 07:31 AM] jvaler#0000
just seems like a pain to attempt before that


[29-Oct-24 07:39 AM] jcheung#0000
i might fiddle with some low end stuff


[29-Oct-24 07:39 AM] jcheung#0000
not too much though


[29-Oct-24 07:39 AM] jcheung#0000
like... power poles/substations


[29-Oct-24 07:40 AM] jcheung#0000
probably substations first


[29-Oct-24 07:40 AM] jcheung#0000
though i'll be happy with just merely getting quality 2 stuff


[29-Oct-24 07:42 AM] jcheung#0000
uncommon, that's what it's called


[29-Oct-24 07:44 AM] jcheung#0000
although.... upgrading the quality modules might not be a bad idea 🤔


[29-Oct-24 04:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Uncommon tanks are pretty great. They get more equipment slots


[29-Oct-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I found doing stuff like higher quality equipment off the bus was fairly clean. I spent a couple hours getting my gear set up but it wasn’t that bad. I think making stuff like all your power poles will be more involved


[29-Oct-24 05:23 PM] jvaler#0000
how do you deal with plates? cause if they're just put on the bus the uncommon ones will clog everything


[29-Oct-24 05:23 PM] jvaler#0000
or do you filter them off at the furnaces to their own area


[29-Oct-24 05:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I put quality modules in all my furnaces and immediately filter off the upgrades and put them into red logistics chests.


[29-Oct-24 05:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even with a lot of furnaces, it's not actually an overwhelming number of plates:

[31-Oct-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s where I save most of my money


[31-Oct-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
There might be cheaper options than betterment out there if you look around too


[31-Oct-24 09:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
For what it’s worth, they also have a savings account with interest at the federal funds rate, so like 4.5% right now


[31-Oct-24 09:47 AM] laaxus#0000
Then the best thing you can do is a world wide ETF (imo)
Basically, you're investing in the global market.
It makes roughly 7-8% a year, and you have nothing to do

1) you save 3 month of  spending into an high % saving account
2) you keep a small amount of money on your current account for your daily use
3) every month, you put everything above the amount 2) into the ETF

[31-Oct-24 09:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
I personally like the robo-advisors because you get a more diversified portfolio than just one ETF, which gives you a bit more control (but they usually charge a small fee as well)


[31-Oct-24 09:52 AM] sidepipe#0000
I can’t find a screenshot of the allocation betterment uses without my account balance, but it’ll split things up into a bunch of different small, medium and large cap ETFs, bond ETFs and international ones


[31-Oct-24 09:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
But it’s up to you if that extra level of control is worth it for you


[31-Oct-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
you think world ETF are not diversified enough ???


[31-Oct-24 09:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
Well, more that you get more control over how it’s diversified


[31-Oct-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
But again, that’s personal preference more than anything else.


[31-Oct-24 09:56 AM] getonthetrain#0000
If you want simple, you probably don't need anything more than the S&P 500 - the 500 largest companies in America, most of which are worldwide. I recommend VOO as Vanguard has very low expense ratios.

mathematically, if you just hold long enough it always goes up because the currency is devalued each day as more is created


[31-Oct-24 09:58 AM] getonthetrain#0000
though at this price level and current world events, there is some case to be wary


[31-Oct-24 09:58 AM] getonthetrain#0000
still, if you are investing for retirement you can hold past any drawdowns


[31-Oct-24 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
If the stock market collapses, we’ll all have bigger things to worry about than retirement 😄


[31-Oct-24 10:02 AM] getonthetrain#0000
If you want international, many remote jobs are being sent to India


[31-Oct-24 10:03 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Those workers will then spend mostly in country and so Indian businesses will likely flourish if this continues

[01-Nov-24 01:14 AM] finestone#0000
If you are 28 just put all of it in VOO (S&P500) if you want more diversity VTI (Total Market) or like 80% VOO 20% VIG (Dividend Value). Have you maxed your roth? I am 29 and have about 80k invested atm pretty knowledgeable if you have more questions.


[01-Nov-24 01:18 AM] finestone#0000
Also think or swim is good but thats for day/swing trading. if you are trying to invest not necessary just use any brokerage.


[01-Nov-24 01:21 AM] finestone#0000
Are you employed? if so you should have a 401k with someone? you can just use them? If not there are a lot of options out there. I just use robinhood as its easy and where i started.


[01-Nov-24 01:25 AM] finestone#0000
If you want to go more in depth with your ETF allocations or individual companies you can but unless you want to put a lot of time into it (I personally enjoy the research) its not really worth the effort and most people (90%+) fail to beat the S&P500. The Easiest and best way for anyone young to invest is to just buy the S&P500 all the time until your 50 years old then slowly reallocate your portfolio into dividends and bonds by like 10% every 2 years so you are 50/50 by age 60 and ready for retirement


[01-Nov-24 01:27 AM] finestone#0000
Hope this helps

You could set up a truck route to move the coal and then also use coal as fuel to fuel the trucks

stack belts on top of each other until you unlock trains


[02-Nov-24 04:27 PM] laaxus#0000
I like the idea of stacking belt
But I don't know how to split one belt vertically


[02-Nov-24 04:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
for long distance belts I use pillars (design on blueprint and slap them)


[02-Nov-24 04:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
increase the gap where you take belt off and use a splitter with lift belt


[02-Nov-24 04:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Trucks
Trains
Stacked conveyors


[02-Nov-24 04:34 PM] jcheung#0000

and I know both you and Laaxus look at the market a bit differently, but we are seeing two symptoms of the same problem


[03-Nov-24 05:30 PM] tanda#0000
look at supply as well as demand, for instance. In Mor, it's like 3-5x more supply, and similar increases in demand


[03-Nov-24 05:31 PM] tanda#0000
people would not be listing those supplies if they did not sell


[03-Nov-24 05:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
the way I see it... Fire has enough cash to stimulate the market as much as he wants


[03-Nov-24 05:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
we need our own IDC kaiju


[03-Nov-24 05:37 PM] tanda#0000
that's going to require a LOT of Rfab


[03-Nov-24 05:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well people I guess we have a plan


[03-Nov-24 05:38 PM] tanda#0000
also, honestly don't know if it's healthy to do that with IDC on that scale (despite me still having a base that's part of that)


[03-Nov-24 05:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
it the only way to sink items that are not IDC


[03-Nov-24 05:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
just sell it to someone who does IDC


[03-Nov-24 05:40 PM] tanda#0000
I actually was thinking maybe trying to do CBS CBM as a slightly healthier IDC


[03-Nov-24 05:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think for me (manufacturing) it's only LOG

[03-Nov-24 06:12 PM] jcheung#0000

How did you get the blueprint mode? Did you do a mod for that? Or is it a ton of commands? I was googling a few weeks ago and couldn't find it


[05-Nov-24 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently the "old way" doesn't work anymore

A lot better than PPv1 yeah


[05-Nov-24 09:34 PM] .shiva.#0000
I havent played the game in 8mo or so, saw they revamped stuff a lot


[05-Nov-24 09:35 PM] .shiva.#0000
Also saw they're going to be adding system capture / colonization which is cool


[05-Nov-24 09:35 PM] zillatron#0000
Yeah still some details to come but PP2.0 is a huge improvement, basically they started over


[05-Nov-24 09:35 PM] zillatron#0000
Idea is more or less the same but the mechanics are completely different

the sidewinder, the hauler, cobra mk3 and a viper mk4

like idk what I was even trying to do with those tbh


[05-Nov-24 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
works if the turret portion is thin enough to begin with, if you plan on making a dense turret section you can't just add more turrets without them being out of range

[05-Nov-24 10:27 PM] moke.#0000
It doesn't hurt to peek around though. I dunno how paranoid the imps are, but don't tell them if you tried out fed first lol.

Try messing with the routing filter from economic to fastest


[05-Nov-24 10:33 PM] zillatron#0000
pretty sure economic is default


[05-Nov-24 10:34 PM] moke.#0000
Just be wary if the line is dotted, that means you will lack fuel

[05-Nov-24 10:38 PM] zillatron#0000
im not sure if its changed but i think you can squeeze a few more bucks out of it by swapping any upgraded modules back to default but tbh it'll be fuck all compared to what you make on the first 2 missions or whatever haha


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can sell it for 7 mil


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] moke.#0000
Is any of it engineered?


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol no


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] moke.#0000
then yeah it's safe to sell


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But should I keep it over the cobra mk3?


[05-Nov-24 10:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or just keep both


[05-Nov-24 10:40 PM] zillatron#0000
Mk4 is a tough little ship but more suited to combat than an all rounder


[05-Nov-24 10:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I have it kitted for bounties


[05-Nov-24 10:41 PM] zillatron#0000
at this point you're better off with the Mk3 imo


[05-Nov-24 10:41 PM] zillatron#0000
yeah then keep it


[05-Nov-24 10:41 PM] zillatron#0000
they're both really good


[05-Nov-24 10:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Should I put any guns on my cobra?


[05-Nov-24 10:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or just yeeyee my way to winter’s space


[05-Nov-24 10:43 PM] zillatron#0000
you should be fine, tactical retreat until you have some better shields and stuff to hold up in a fight


[05-Nov-24 10:43 PM] zillatron#0000
but pew pews are never bad to have


[05-Nov-24 10:44 PM] moke.#0000
Probably best to relocate, and then figure out what you want to do from there

iirc, the area around rhea has some solid high-tech stations for stuff too


[05-Nov-24 10:52 PM] moke.#0000
But that's 2 year old hazy knowledge


[05-Nov-24 10:52 PM] moke.#0000
As far as rebuying/refitting ships


[05-Nov-24 10:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk what any of that means ☺️


[05-Nov-24 10:52 PM] moke.#0000
More likely to have more ship hulls + parts for outfitting


[05-Nov-24 10:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[05-Nov-24 11:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but idk how to do it


[05-Nov-24 11:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its a salvage mission


[05-Nov-24 11:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It says the target body is a shipping lane between two planets and puts the mission marker on the second of the two planets


[06-Nov-24 12:18 AM] zillatron#0000
i havent done one of these in like 4 years lol but iirc if you fly from the jump in point directly to the planet where the marker is a mission signal will show up when you get close, drop on that, pick up the stuff then gtfo

[06-Nov-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve always wanted to try Kvass, or make it


[06-Nov-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
I like Kombucha. It’s hard to find a similarly dry drink that’s not alcoholic 😄


[06-Nov-24 12:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's very similar but instead of tea, you make it out of grain


[06-Nov-24 12:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I happen to like many fermented drinks made of grain 😁


[06-Nov-24 12:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I like barley tea


[06-Nov-24 12:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000

They roast the grain then crush it up and steep it in hot water

[06-Nov-24 01:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
There also is a barley tea adjacent drink that you mix in to milk or water and it looks like Coffee (kinda tastes like it too)


[06-Nov-24 01:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
uh Caro I think


[06-Nov-24 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But another interesting tea is Juuroku cha


[06-Nov-24 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And also soba cha


[06-Nov-24 01:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah, made from roasted barley and malted barley and stuff


[06-Nov-24 01:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
More things for the list 😄


[06-Nov-24 01:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m sure this isn’t a novel position to be in, but I don’t drink a ton of soda, and I feel like there are few drinks in america that aren’t really high in sugar or alcoholic


[06-Nov-24 01:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or rather, I just don’t know about those drinks


[06-Nov-24 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's true. Some people like the lacroix / Bubly (boo-blay) stuff. Which is just carbonated water with hints of various fruits


[06-Nov-24 01:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Although when I went to Los Angeles for a conference, I couldn't find soda anywhere and they just had shelf after shelf of KOM


[06-Nov-24 01:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
I do drink lots of carbonated water. It’s a holdover from my time in Germany 😄


[06-Nov-24 01:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it kinda falls into the water category for me


[06-Nov-24 01:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Teas are nice


[06-Nov-24 01:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh and the nice thing about Barley tea it can be hot or cold


[06-Nov-24 01:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Same with juuroku cha and Soba tea


[06-Nov-24 01:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Caro as well can be hot or cold


[06-Nov-24 01:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Very versatile


[06-Nov-24 01:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Basically I just like liquids with flavor and there’s not enough flavors in my life 😂


[06-Nov-24 01:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
But I’ll look into those, they sound interesting


[06-Nov-24 01:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could try corn tea 🥴


[06-Nov-24 01:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh and Red Bush Tea aka Rooibos Tea is good too


[06-Nov-24 01:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m not Midwest enough for that


[06-Nov-24 01:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Different flavor


[06-Nov-24 01:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I had it in Japan

[07-Nov-24 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
well


[07-Nov-24 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
iirc these are like single car automated trains right?


[07-Nov-24 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
this does allow significantly more flexibility


[07-Nov-24 12:03 AM] jcheung#0000
and potentially higher throughput, especially on single lane tracks


[07-Nov-24 12:03 AM] jcheung#0000
it also allows for faster delivery


[07-Nov-24 12:08 AM] jcheung#0000
this wouldn't be used for like coal supply to power plants

i keep trying to have chocolate but i’m not allowed to 😔

Not that retail is a bad job or anything, I’m just too anti-social to do customer-facing work.


[07-Nov-24 12:25 PM] laaxus#0000
retail is a bad job


[07-Nov-24 12:25 PM] laaxus#0000
(99% of the time)


[07-Nov-24 12:25 PM] laaxus#0000
not because of the job itself, but because of customers


[07-Nov-24 12:25 PM] laaxus#0000
one bad customers is all it takes to ruin your day


[07-Nov-24 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
and this is without talking about pay and work conditions


[07-Nov-24 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
100% would not recommend


[07-Nov-24 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
it's great as part time / student job tho


[07-Nov-24 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000
The customer aspect improves your soft skill, which is not bad + flexibility


[07-Nov-24 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000

Bruh... One to one... I've told people that looks pretty boring... they convinced me... I downloaded to play... we played 2 hours... never played again


[12-Nov-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
We started a server


[12-Nov-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
They played 2 hrs, i played 4
Next day i played 3 and they showed up for an hour


[12-Nov-24 09:19 AM] jcheung#0000
Then that was the last i ever saw of them on that server and i got bored

But then you buy it when you know “heh I like this game”

Also like FS always goes in sale…


[12-Nov-24 10:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
Okay that’s fair. Tbh I don’t play a bunch of games myself, I jump between the same 5-10. It’s more trying to find new things to play with friends where I buy most games


[12-Nov-24 10:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
God I have a problem


[12-Nov-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000

Rice would be interesting in FS. Lotta that where I'm at irl and it's fascinating to watch the flooding cycles

Vic3 rice fields ptsd


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Well. Depends also on how you grow the rice


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Flooding it is optional after all


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] laaxus#0000
don't


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Can also just grow it similar to wheat iirc, but lower yield


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I will let everyone know


[12-Nov-24 10:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[12-Nov-24 10:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yes but it doesn’t have to be submerged in it


[12-Nov-24 10:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
Since hot and dry weather will just evaporate ponds


[12-Nov-24 10:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Wanna know what blows my mind


[12-Nov-24 10:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Why the west chooses to grow corn and hay


[12-Nov-24 10:22 AM] .urpalhal#0000
We have no water out here and choose water intensive crops


[12-Nov-24 10:22 AM] jcheung#0000
Rice doesn't either


[12-Nov-24 10:23 AM] marat_sh#0000
I remember the stories my mom used to tell me how in soviet union corn was brought 💀


[12-Nov-24 10:23 AM] jcheung#0000
But yes, flooded rice takes around double what cotton does


[12-Nov-24 10:23 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am not a rice field expert but i’ve seen them to be growing in water


[12-Nov-24 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
So flooding rice is a weed control measure


[12-Nov-24 10:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
Ah I see


[12-Nov-24 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
Rice can 100% grow without flooding


[12-Nov-24 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
But because flooding can control weeds, the yield is better


[12-Nov-24 10:25 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I hope you don't have mosquitos down there.


[12-Nov-24 10:26 AM] jcheung#0000
Rice paddys are always mosquito farms

Me? We had a lot of mosquitoes… and now I live in Florida 💀


[12-Nov-24 10:27 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Can you keep like fish species in those rice fields? Would do wonders for the mosquito populations, if that water wouldn't be so muddy.


[12-Nov-24 10:27 AM] marat_sh#0000
Or spiders… I love spiders ❤️


[12-Nov-24 10:28 AM] jcheung#0000

I love spiders as long as my wife doesn't see them 😄


[12-Nov-24 10:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ahh yes, spiders. The spiders in my house, when they're young at least.... Love to drop down from the ceiling on a single strand of spider silk, with like 5 inches of my face, when I walk into my kitchen. Then I give them a puff of air, and they scramble for safety XD.


[12-Nov-24 10:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
I don't mind spiders at home until they make too much web... then they gotta go outside


[12-Nov-24 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000
I had 1 spider at the start of the summer, it was welcome.
I have now 4 spiders at the start of the winter, i'm sorry but to the vacuum cleaner they go.

[12-Nov-24 10:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well they were bred for quite a long time, for a distinct purpose (pest control / entertainment)... But cats cannot deal with rat colonies that infest your stuff. You need a good bit of water, + pitbulls, or whatever other breed of dog that is not wimpy.


[12-Nov-24 10:38 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The rats dig under ground. Seeing rats on the surface is not the issue. The issue is what lies beneath your feet.


[12-Nov-24 10:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
if I ever have rat problems, I'm just moving out 😄


[12-Nov-24 10:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
messing with cats is the most important part of cat ownership


[12-Nov-24 10:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, I'm pretty sure they domesticated us, not the other way around 😛


[12-Nov-24 10:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mm, is domestication top/bottom, to ensure some sort of utility for the top species, or does domestication require the willingness of the bottom species, to ensure it's long-term survival, by getting all the perks of being a beloved pet?


[12-Nov-24 10:46 AM] marat_sh#0000
i have an allergy to cats 🥲


[12-Nov-24 10:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah I'm not arguing that. At best, cats + humans have a symbiotic relationship. 🙂

starting with calculating burns, and I want to eventually generate XIT action packages right from the file to resupply my bases 🙂


[16-Nov-24 08:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
and I want to dial in the 'target' resupply amount so it all fits in one ship where possible


[16-Nov-24 09:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Nice. I started a sheet to do that when I was supplying lots of governments. Instead of supplying for 30 days or something static, I would just use the daily ratio of needed supplies, calculate how many days of supplies fit in 1 LCB ship, then add a recurring delivery for those numbers at that interval to my calendar ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16-Nov-24 12:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Will let you know when I think of a good way, but I think you can do it with the sites and recipes from FIO


[16-Nov-24 12:39 PM] tanda#0000
That's what I'm thinking too, but then it feels like I'm building a mini prun planner inside the sheet


[16-Nov-24 12:51 PM] manhim#0000
The new API for PrunPlanner is great to get that data (materialio). But you need to keep your plans updated.

I setup my sheet manually, but I have a mechanism that warns me if my sheet is different from the API.


[16-Nov-24 12:58 PM] tanda#0000
I'll have to give that a very solid look, thanks for pointing that out.

i'm totally wrong, it's not the new API


[16-Nov-24 02:50 PM] jvaler#0000

the universe 7d and 30d prices are unique to prunplanner. It uses data from fio to generate them but then calculates and stores them in prunplanner

Effort: 10/10. Stupidity 10/10. 

But they basically had the idea of a helicopter right there. Just had to simplify the design. I don't think they had models for fluid dynamics either, back in those days.

You don't even need snowfall... Just some lukewarm precipitation on the night before, and below freezing temps in the morning. Lots of "stranded" drivers who managed to get in the gores on the highways. (black-ice)

[21-Nov-24 07:17 PM] .shiva.#0000
`clone --recursive` is a newer way to do it from the get go


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
`submodule update ...` is when you already have a repo checked out and need to get the submodules


[21-Nov-24 07:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
and was the older way you had to do it


[21-Nov-24 07:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
and really it's *technically* `git clone --recurse-submodules ` now...

oh I can choose in the set up of git


[21-Nov-24 07:27 PM] .shiva.#0000
you clone a remote repository. and only need the recursive bit if it's using submodules


[21-Nov-24 07:28 PM] .shiva.#0000
if you're making a new repo locally, it's init

That they're required to pay for. If the maximum is 2 years, there should be a minimum period listed? Or is it just... any/all sickness = paid time off?

you may be qualified for additional protections if you live in one of several cool states

Hm never had that. But I'm self employed so I get zero of anything 😆


[22-Nov-24 02:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah you also don't get FMLA if you work in a business with under 50 employees


[22-Nov-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a lot of retail / fast food keeps their workers part time so they can fire them too.


[22-Nov-24 02:15 PM] razenpok#0000

yep, 38.5 hours a week or whatever the line is


[22-Nov-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I imagine they are still at-will employees, so you can fire them for other reasons if they take FMLA, or try to fire them before they take it

As a software engineer, many of my acquaintances are considering working a few years in the US, but I honestly can't even consider it


[22-Nov-24 02:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah. from what I understand your pay is a lot higher, but there's a lot more external costs that you need to worry about


[22-Nov-24 02:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
so take-home pay could actually be lower after you account for all your private health insurance and stuff

I don't know anyone who thought that more money would make them happy, that was actually happy once they got more money. Its rarely about the money, and often about the "more".

[22-Nov-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess it depends on what "more" money gets you. cause there's a pretty wide area between "surviving" and surviving with a cushion that provides a few months of rent + health insurance + car repairs +  school supplies / activities + all those other bills


[22-Nov-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
When it was just me, I could live pretty cheaply on almost nothing, now that I got an expensive kid and wife, it's more anxiety inducing to think of the consequences of not making all the bills


[22-Nov-24 02:28 PM] laaxus#0000
I watched yesterday a video about energetic transition in europe.
One of the speaker said that restrainment and sobriety is unthinkable in the US, because that's a country that had limitless oil gas, other natural resource and space, so it's just not in their culture, because of geographical reasons.
While in europe, we're running out of everything.


[22-Nov-24 02:29 PM] laaxus#0000
and I quite agree tbh


[22-Nov-24 02:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, I think the incentives are quite different when you're a net consumer of something vs a net producer. Not that there isn't also a "bigger, better, and less MPG" streak in america, but we've definitely got entrenched and powerful interests in oil and gas since we make so much of it


[22-Nov-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I got a cheap car with amazing gas milage and I get a lot of people who think i'm weird for not owning an absolutely gigantic pickup truck.

I'm in the process to move out to 5m away from my work place, so I can stop having a car and do everything by foot and bike


[22-Nov-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, that's totally a thing, but I think too many people tow something once every 5 years and buy one. Every couple years I buy some sheetrock and I just rent the menards truck for like $30. Compared to the price of buying a $50k truck


[22-Nov-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000

< In Australia, so car market is a little different. My parents when they retired did the - travel aronud the country with a caravan thing.. which is pretty popular here.

First they used a Toyota Landcruiser + Offroad caravan to get to all the hard to get to places -
Then they used a big fat Chev imported from the US +bigger caravan to do the rest of the stuff that was reachable via roads. Feedback they gave me was - parking is a bitch, but it's great on the open road while towing a caravan.

Awesome vid.
I drive a 24 year old hilux, and it provides me with unprecedented levels of not giving a fk. I haven't given it a service for over 200 thousand km's.. and at this stage, I just wanna see how far I can go with that. Doors haven't locked properly for a few years, but it's got a clutch, aka, millennial antitheft device, so it's all good 🙂

The risk/reward is just not worth it to steal. Might get a few thousand bucks for it if you're lucky, and risk 
A. Getting caught stealing cars for such a shitty pay off.
B. Risk eating a hammer to the back of the head (which is not an unreasonable possibility when stealing tradesman type vehicles )

Either way from my perspective, it's not a meaningful loss and I'll just buy another one and continue to not give a fk 🙂

no parking. you heard it officer, tow it


[23-Nov-24 01:53 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
a clutch is now considered an anti theft device??? how many young people cant drive a manual shift?


[23-Nov-24 01:53 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I learned driving on a manual shift, now i can drive both - manual and automatic cars ^_^


[23-Nov-24 01:54 PM] tanda#0000

I love manual, but I mainly drive with cruise control


[23-Nov-24 02:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve never driven a manual, but I assume I could figure it out if I had to 😄


[23-Nov-24 02:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
Though I do have one of those automatics where you can manually select some gears. I’ve just never touched it


[23-Nov-24 02:02 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, same. And I see no reason to ever use those gears


[23-Nov-24 02:02 PM] avalock#0000
I can't even drive :3


[23-Nov-24 02:03 PM] laaxus#0000
What's the point of having a car if you don't feel like initial d mc


[23-Nov-24 02:03 PM] tanda#0000
the transmission is completely different too, so it's not like gear selection means a ton on an automatic


[23-Nov-24 02:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have a Volvo wagon, so I’m never gonna feel like initial d 😄

[23-Nov-24 02:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
But sometimes I put my other hand on the shifter and pretend to change gears while I drive. Does that count?

[23-Nov-24 03:14 PM] .shiva.#0000
Interestingly, newer articles are talking about how manual sales are up in the US


[23-Nov-24 03:14 PM] .shiva.#0000
But its still like <2%


[23-Nov-24 03:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
When you focus on the derivatives... But forget the statistics...


[23-Nov-24 03:16 PM] astra1414#0000
"In 2023, only 29% (551,000) of the 1.9 million new cars registered in the UK in 2023 had manual gearboxes. That’s a reduction of nearly 25% since 2019 when 51% of new cars were manuals." more drastic than i had thought


[23-Nov-24 03:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Speaking of cars, I just had to pull apart a family member's rear brake assembly... "Do you have only brake pads over there?" .... "Idk...".... " **>.> You have both, and we don't have the parts for either**"


[23-Nov-24 03:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Brake pads, AND brake shoes.. Like what kind of engineering is this?


[23-Nov-24 03:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, brake work is a huge pain


[23-Nov-24 03:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
seems like you always have to take apart more of the car than you expect


[23-Nov-24 03:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you don't have a brake tool "little sprocket tool that spreads out the brake springs so you can remove/apply them" -- trying to fiddle with just those things will take 2 hours of manual labour.


[23-Nov-24 03:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Fk. Make me feel old 😆


[23-Nov-24 03:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
and even with the tool it's not much better 😦


[23-Nov-24 03:24 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I love driving manual though. It's fun, they're hard to find now though, unless you can afford sporty cars


[23-Nov-24 03:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Some WD-40 or brake grease remover does the trick. The internals are usually lathered in a thin coating of grease. Brute force does wonders, but modern economics doesn't really reward physical aptitude, unless you're like in the NFL or WWE, and even then you won't avoid the hurt.


[23-Nov-24 03:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The new Nissan versa bare bones version is a manual

[23-Nov-24 03:39 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
In India you can buy both transmissions. Manuals are quite popular though, 70% of the car sales. 

Automatics are more expensive than the manual transmission versions.


[23-Nov-24 03:41 PM] astra1414#0000
never driven on a public road but from when i have driven both manual and automatic, manual felt much better overall. i'd definitely prefer a manual over auto


[23-Nov-24 03:42 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I would take automatic over manual because I hate driving and cars in general 😅


[23-Nov-24 03:43 PM] astra1414#0000
that's always a factor yeah


[23-Nov-24 05:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
True, but when these came out I got a manual - and then I had to learn how to drive one lol

The more cars use either full or hybrid battery tech, the fewer manual transmission cars you'll see... it's not really an option on those types of car. The reduction of manual cars in the UK is almost certainly due to the increased take up in full electric cars, see them everywhere now.

[01-Dec-24 02:56 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm dealing with some WW2-era, cast iron drain catches in my house, which receive inputs from the upper level of the building...

Per the pic, these drain catches serves as a collection point for solid waste/detritus, lest those things be sent down the connected pipes --- they have a screw joint at the bottom, which allow someone to clear out the whole segment without too much work...

However, some brilliant contractor decided to install one of those drain catches, at an 90-degree angle to the convention (defying physical laws and nullifying the intended purpose of said part), and it's causing a whole issue along 75+ feet of piping. (This is some 80+ years ago from the original installation, but still!).

So whilst tring to unplug a given section of piping, I get slammed with 5+ liters of gunk, and rather dank water. **IF you're going to purchase a house -- Inspect Everything!!!**

Between Zion and Vegas, all I could think of was "Why arent there massive fucking solar farms out here.

But then I also saw a huge solar panel farm 30 mins outside vegas and I felt a little better, but said "Great, now do it 10x more"

[03-Dec-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
in fairness not every solution is just "add more solar"


[03-Dec-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
also have to add power storage, inertial mass, power storage, baseload power, power storage


[03-Dec-24 12:26 PM] realharvey#0000
I do believe that we can build quite a lot more solar power before running into a storage problem


[03-Dec-24 12:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This is America. It's how any solution is usually imagined. Something broken? Duct tape... Still broken, more duct tape.

Don't worry, will shove the hard work onto the engineers and construction workers to actually implement, at the lowest possible salaries and benefit packages... Hmm that reminds me how I run a few of my bases. Anyways :P.


[03-Dec-24 12:28 PM] jcheung#0000
we already have storage issues


[03-Dec-24 12:29 PM] jcheung#0000
though honestly, inertial mass is probably more important in the short term


[03-Dec-24 12:29 PM] jcheung#0000
solar has almost no inertial mass, so it can't stabilize the grid


[03-Dec-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
ah, who am i kidding, solar has no inertial mass at all


[03-Dec-24 12:36 PM] realharvey#0000
Solar Power in the U.S. is pretty low. And while obviously useless during the night you can use it during the day and turn off gas powered power generation which usually have quite low spin up and down times

that "nuclear" band needs to expand


[03-Dec-24 12:38 PM] jcheung#0000
also, okay, i thought solar took up a little more than that


[03-Dec-24 12:39 PM] jcheung#0000
both wind and solar though have similar issues at scale though


[03-Dec-24 12:40 PM] realharvey#0000
Indeed. The current best solution is to expand gas power and renewable energy. To solve the storage problem use renewable energy to generate hydrogen


[03-Dec-24 12:41 PM] jcheung#0000
hydrogen is probably one of the worst power storage methods available


[03-Dec-24 12:41 PM] realharvey#0000
This way you can either us fossil gas or hydrogen to reach the power levels


[03-Dec-24 12:41 PM] realharvey#0000
It's a stepstone to reuse Gaspowerplants


[03-Dec-24 12:41 PM] jcheung#0000
hmmm. now i'm curious what the conversion from nat gas to h2 would look like


[03-Dec-24 12:42 PM] jcheung#0000
oh. nat gas + h2 mixes are being tested now, neat


[03-Dec-24 12:42 PM] realharvey#0000
While nuclear might solve the CO2 problem we have it just creates another problem with nuclear waste

You can't manage crops failing, rain not falling and roads freezing

nat gas is orders of magnitude worse for toxic wastes, and coal several orders over that


[03-Dec-24 12:44 PM] realharvey#0000
Well it's not. There are currently no storage solutions that can keep nuclear waste save for their radioactive times

[03-Dec-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
low level wastes can be compressed into blocks and stored in low level storage-this is the bulk of "nuclear wastes"


[03-Dec-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
natural gas power plants are not a good long term solution either


[03-Dec-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
conversion to h2 only makes them highly inefficient batteries


[03-Dec-24 12:46 PM] realharvey#0000
Current storage solutions in Germany will lead to nuclear leaks in the not so far future


[03-Dec-24 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000
though i will admit they're better for some of the other issues i mentioned earlier, for intertial mass


[03-Dec-24 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000

are we gonna wait 30 years that mining operations speed up ?


[03-Dec-24 12:46 PM] realharvey#0000
I agree that keeping current nuclear plants makes more sense than coal power plants


[03-Dec-24 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000
germany shoving anything nuclear related under the rug and ignoring it is the real problem


[03-Dec-24 12:48 PM] jcheung#0000
and we should be opening new ones. existing ones are aging out. they're extremely efficient, low waste and are excellent for base load power


[03-Dec-24 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
We can't wait 50 more years for complete transition with somehow only solar and wind


[03-Dec-24 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
We need more green energy NOW


[03-Dec-24 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
and the quickest way to do that is solar wind AND nuclear


[03-Dec-24 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
all together


[03-Dec-24 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
we CANT afford to not build any of them


[03-Dec-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
tried to look for how they would be a problem in the near future, turning up nothing. can you provide some more information?


[03-Dec-24 12:50 PM] realharvey#0000
Well there is also not enough nuclear fuel currently to cover the demand


[03-Dec-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
what? where do you see that?


[03-Dec-24 12:50 PM] realharvey#0000
I could only give you german videos lol


[03-Dec-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
96% of the nuclear waste are reusable, we just don't do it because it's not economicaly worth it
and there are enough fuel for at least a century, which is what we need
Plus there are other possible fuel than uranium, india is for example very interested in their domestic thorium


[03-Dec-24 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
the only thing that i've found so far was that interim storage sites are only permitted to exist 30 years at a time and renewal for some are coming in the next 5 years


[03-Dec-24 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
which are safely containing the wastes with zero incidents


[03-Dec-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
anyway, as said, we CANT afford not to use that nuclear energy as much as we can

it's either that or coal and gas


[03-Dec-24 12:53 PM] jcheung#0000
the high level wastes anyways-the low level wastes like gloves which make up the bulk of the stuff aren't worth it


[03-Dec-24 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000
And if you want to see how an economy react to pure solar and wind, you can look at germany that is literaly deindustrializing


[03-Dec-24 12:54 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Disagree, more solar, along with supporting infrastructure, like you mentioned.

I've said it before and I'll say it again - how much pollution have the anti-nuclear groups allowed to happen because of their aversion to nuclear energy? Most of them are paid BY existing coal/natural gas/oil interests to stop a transition away from their use and therefore their profits

We need SOLAR + WIND + NUCLEAR, the three of them, as much as we can


[03-Dec-24 12:55 PM] realharvey#0000
Nuclear waste in Germany is currently stored in decommissioned salt mines in Germany. These mines are not designed for this purpose and there have been studies that estimate this storage to be very unsafe in the future. The reason for this is the groundwater, which will at some point penetrate the salt mine through erosion and then cause nuclear-contaminated water.


[03-Dec-24 12:55 PM] jcheung#0000
do you know what people have been doing with groundwater intrusion in mines for the last... however long we've been digging deep holes?

Germany was the world market leader in solar for a while. (It was also heavily subsidized). This led to electricity becoming too cheap and this led to companies earning less money and the lobby intervened

every time a site looks promising the locals all get scared and shut it down.

because anti nuclear people try to slow them down at every single step

do you know why nuclear takes so long to build? because anti-nuclear protestors lobby to have it shut down and it goes through thousands more safety checks than any other power plant. which the safety checks are a good thing, but the delays are not

[03-Dec-24 01:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A better argument of which energy source to use more, is not of the method, but of the means. 

Global energy usages are directly pinned to the average kWh that a given country, with a given technological infrastructure and electrical demands, which are then pinned to the long-term population dynamics of said country. 

To simply reduce electrical use, by say maybe changing lifestyles, is just one bean in a bucket of many. But any of those said beans have their ramifications.


[03-Dec-24 01:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Reduce energy use with lifestyle changes, and you'll be killing off many, many industries, which then will have their own subsequent consequences. Less industry, less profits, less people employed, mo' problems. 

Global energy use tends to mirror ecological relationships in biological studies, and system dynamics in operational studies... You'll want to confer with the rest of the human population before you want to impose Climate Policy on stuff, in a top-down, or arm-chair approach.


[03-Dec-24 01:14 PM] razenpok#0000
The problem with NPP is that most people don't understand what's going on inside. It's easier to say "I'm burning shit to get electricity", or "My turbine spins to get electricity" than "My funny rocks do ??? to get electricity. Also those rocks go big boom if you want them to."


[03-Dec-24 01:14 PM] razenpok#0000
Also, public image has long been bad for NPP due to idk something

When people say we just reduce energy consumption most of them mean it by: Using energy more efficient. A lot of power goes into heating houses for example, If you increase insulation you need less heat for example

[03-Dec-24 01:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, I'd love to follow the trains of the economic processes, much like we usually do in Prun when we figure out what things we want to make. 

But all of those things eventually do end up in retail products directly, or in infrastructure/capital to support all of those sales, indirectly. Hence my original point, which I wanted jcheung to elaborate.


[03-Dec-24 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
unlike prun, aluminum isn't constrained to 40 processes, so i'm going to have to decline going over the trillions of products that contain some amount of aluminum in them


[03-Dec-24 01:23 PM] jcheung#0000
weird aint it? almost like it's a cheap, efficient method to create power


[03-Dec-24 01:26 PM] realharvey#0000
I guess ultimately you are right. Altough I think for germany especially nuclear is currently not really an option


[03-Dec-24 01:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think the point is that you can’t really separate ‘corporate’ vs ‘individual’ emissions as such because most corporations make stuff for individuals to consume. If a company makes a car and you buy it, are you responsible for the emissions involved in the car’s production, or is the individual responsible? Etc etc


[03-Dec-24 01:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah it's pretty bad. No one knows everything. Worse yet when you try to think on things that you don't have the financial/economic data on ( all I get is just accounting summaries on SEC requirements).


[03-Dec-24 01:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think we’re gonna keep having this discussion forever as long as we have a market-based economy where all the external costs of emissions aren’t priced into the final product. Assuming we don’t want to get rid of markets, I’d love a carbon tax for starters 😄

[03-Dec-24 01:32 PM] laaxus#0000
I mean that, in the history of humanity, we never saw a decrease in energy consumption alongside an increase of standard of living.
That the standard of living is the primary concern of every single citizen.
And that even thought the share of people concerned about the environement increase, I don't believe it'll ever be a % big enough that it would compensante the increased consumption of the other share that doesn't care


[03-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
However, the gov should put in place policies such that even those that do not care about the environment, do environement friendly things because it's in their best interest


[03-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
This is however indirect, and therefore unreliable


[03-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000

Hmm.. Make more lumber forests? There was a piece of tech that came out not that long ago.... Basically pressure/mechanical compressed lumber, which squeezes a 6x6 down to say a 2x4, which maintains structural stats very close to say structural steel, within a 1 sig-fig decimal point.


[03-Dec-24 01:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't think that's a strong argument. The fact that it hasn't happened before just doesn't call to me much at all. Energy usage varies quite a lot by country and lower energy usage countries can have similar or higher standards of living than others (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use)

It's less of an argument, and more of a consideration... 

If all of those geospatial hotspots on that map are taken over a time series... There probably was heavy, long-term industrial development in all of the global north, for like 200 years? Meanwhile the global south seen very little, and is only ramping up.


[03-Dec-24 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
just because nothing can be done, doesn't mean we should do nothing

I just don't get why reducing energy consumption is out of the question in your view. The way I see it, it MUST happen for things to improve. At minimum the rate of increase of energy use must slow down


[03-Dec-24 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I just don't see it happening, 0%


[03-Dec-24 01:43 PM] jcheung#0000
it's a bad consideration. at scale, we don't need stronger materials, we need more efficient ones-compressing a 6x6 into a 2x4 gets you something stronger, but also several dozen times more expensive in processing and volume of raw material


[03-Dec-24 01:44 PM] laaxus#0000
Doesn't mean it won't happen

At scale? It's less troublesome if your time series ocurrs over a long time... Yeah it's really bad if you're going to convert the whole structural construction market in the world from one thing, to another right now -- but over time it could be better.

I’d love to see a carbon tax and stricter regulations around new construction in the US for starters. I live in a new apartment in the American Midwest which is all electric and uh questionably insulated. It’s nuts how much it costs to heat this _new_ building


[03-Dec-24 01:48 PM] laaxus#0000
Well, I followed university courses about life cycle assesment and the like


[03-Dec-24 01:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
But no developer is going to install a heat pump or something like that in an apartment because $$$


[03-Dec-24 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
and many cases where you think using wood and natural are better for the environment, are not

You can either rework the market, or give economic incentives to lead the market where you want it to go

yeah.... it costs them money, even though in the long run it saves money. they don't care because they get paid "instantly", not over 10 years

For a corpo to “ethical” they have to maximize profits

Also, about the energy reduction argument. I don't read books often, but out of the 2 climate books I've read, 100% mentioned 2000 Watt Society


[03-Dec-24 01:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I haven't looked at them really yet but I found it funny


[03-Dec-24 01:51 PM] realharvey#0000
To stop the corporate greed at the cost of the enviroment all countries need to enforce the same rules. But nobody wants to put their own country at a disadvantage.

The  climate crisis will require investment never seen before, for both the transition AND the adaptation as we will inevitably fail the 2 deg threshold

[03-Dec-24 01:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nuclear power is pretty carbon friendly


[03-Dec-24 01:55 PM] jcheung#0000
in that case 12kw is a little low


[03-Dec-24 01:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah but the point is they also installed electric resistive heating with poor insulation


[03-Dec-24 01:55 PM] realharvey#0000
Some approaches refer not only to electricity, but to energy in general. We also need a lot of heat and kinetic energy in our everyday lives.


[03-Dec-24 01:55 PM] jcheung#0000
might be closer to like 500kw per person now


[03-Dec-24 01:56 PM] laaxus#0000
Nuclear power are so environment friendly that the only talking point of corrupted anti nuclear, are  50 yo unsafe designs (not used anymore) and small manageable wastes

I recommend the documentary nuclear now. It really kinda shows who funds the anti nuclear propaganda


[03-Dec-24 01:57 PM] laaxus#0000
And also how slow they are to build, so we should never try to accelerate (and actually build them)

ideally, no


[03-Dec-24 01:59 PM] laaxus#0000

But if SMR is what gets us there then


[03-Dec-24 01:59 PM] jcheung#0000
SMRs are harder to shut down in construction with lobbying because the construction window is a lot smaller

[03-Dec-24 02:02 PM] realharvey#0000
Okay I've looked up some studies. (In german sorry) From renown institutes. The statistics are for europe, for other locations in might vary. But the conclusion is: it takes longer to scale up nuclear power and its more expensive to scale it currently.


[03-Dec-24 02:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s basically in bespoking a full reactor and mass producing them


[03-Dec-24 02:02 PM] realharvey#0000
Nuclear power is by far the most expensive overall

because i feel like they've overblown nuclear a significant amount


[03-Dec-24 02:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Overblown? Wym?


[03-Dec-24 02:06 PM] realharvey#0000
nuclear has a big overhead costs. Building those powerplants consumes a lot of ressources and building materials


[03-Dec-24 02:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah hence SMR and mass production pushes as of late


[03-Dec-24 02:06 PM] jcheung#0000
so does wind and solar-nuclear also has a longer lifespan


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but you don’t need any fuel for wind and solar


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
It’s basically set and forget with regular maintenance


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Even nuclear has fuel costs


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
solar and wind is unpredictable


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well those bits are hard to recycle and not hard power


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
which is why nuclear would do so well as baseload


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
nuclear is extremely predictable


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
also the fuel cost is negligible


[03-Dec-24 02:07 PM] laaxus#0000
does the solar and wind turbines price take account of the shit ton of money needed in energy storage (basically batteries) ?
And how that price goes higher and higher, the higher the share of solar and wind is ?


[03-Dec-24 02:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Probably not


[03-Dec-24 02:08 PM] laaxus#0000
and how that price is currently zero because NPP and GAS/COAL reduce their production when solar and wind produces ?


[03-Dec-24 02:08 PM] realharvey#0000
We dont have nuclear raw materials in our countries as far as I know. So we make our power super dependable on other contries which could fuck up fuel prices


[03-Dec-24 02:09 PM] laaxus#0000
ah yes, we are totally not entirely dependant on china for solar cells and wind turbines


[03-Dec-24 02:09 PM] laaxus#0000

[03-Dec-24 02:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
Here in the American Midwest, most of my power is still coal and gas. There’s plenty of room for renewable power before we need to start handling baseline generation.


[03-Dec-24 02:12 PM] realharvey#0000
We were able to do it. Until politics fucked up and went conservative because fossil fuel lobby didnt like the decrease in profit

What is your take on electic vehicles guys? Yes/No?


[03-Dec-24 02:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Kinda better than gas cars, but don’t fundamentally address the problem that there’s way more efficient ways to move humans around


[03-Dec-24 02:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean battery tech needs some work

And I think it just offsets the emissions else where


[03-Dec-24 02:28 PM] jcheung#0000
full electric rollout might not be a good idea.
efficiency hybrids though, should be rolled out everywhere


[03-Dec-24 02:28 PM] realharvey#0000
they are definitly not carbon neutral. But over the lifespam of a car it emits less than current petrol cars


[03-Dec-24 02:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d totally buy a used small EV like a golf for commuting to work tho


[03-Dec-24 02:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Preferably trams or anything that saves batteries for something better

Bc like out here in the west there is like 0 chargers


[03-Dec-24 02:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And lots of miles to go


[03-Dec-24 02:30 PM] jcheung#0000
what i mean by efficiency hybrid, would be a small gas or diesel engine that runs at a constant speed to turn a generator, and a small (relative) battery pack that can handle like 25-50 miles.


[03-Dec-24 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
runs significantly more efficiently, and allows for regen braking


[03-Dec-24 02:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So a train


[03-Dec-24 02:31 PM] realharvey#0000
Those hybrid cars would be usefull for people that actually drive long distances on a regular basis. Which 90% of the population does not


[03-Dec-24 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
works for short range as well. plug 'em in at night


[03-Dec-24 02:31 PM] realharvey#0000
you dont need the petrolengine then


[03-Dec-24 02:32 PM] jcheung#0000
the important thing about them is that it enables regen braking and more efficient fuel use


[03-Dec-24 02:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000

the engine allows for extended range, rapid refueling, and allows more time for electrical infrastructure to be upgraded

Did you know that the ford transit is assembled in turkey with seats then has to be unassembled a bit to make it a cargo van to be sold in the US bc of some archaic tariff


[03-Dec-24 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
it's not that archaic


[03-Dec-24 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
it's relatively new, as far as laws are concerned

I believe I saw some success with blocking sections of existing cities to cars and increasing focus on buses

(Chicken tax)


[03-Dec-24 02:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think what consistently surprises me is that we’ve structured our entire society around these multi-national corporations which are solely designed to maximize profits above all else and then we keep being surprised when they maximize profits above all else (and this isn’t directed at anyone here). If it’s cheaper to evade a tariff by installing extra seats than to build cars in the US, why wouldn’t they do that? If it’s more profitable to evade a regulation than follow it, why would they ever follow it?

[03-Dec-24 02:51 PM] jcheung#0000
let's see....
chicken tax, 25% tariff on "light trucks" around 1964 (and a bunch of other things, but those were lifted long ago)
japan shipped trucks with no bed, loophole closed 1980
subaru installed seats in bed 1978-1987 to make it a pax vehicle

in 1989 us custom updated it so any two door suv is a light truck
so people crammed tiny little seats behind the driver and made it so the door opened two ways, "four doors"
mercedes and dodge shipped "some assembly required" kits to usa 2001-2006
some other companies did the same after they stopped
ford made their transits pax and removed the seats 2002-2018, then they were sued in 2020 and lost 250m in back tariffs for this
chrysler also did the same in 2015

BUT
this in conjunction with the clean air act of 1970's is what really crippled things for efficiency

basically you were allowed certain amount of emissions based on the size of your vehicle. small vehicles were given absolutely insane emission standards, and it was easier to increase the size of the vehicle to get into a new emissions range-you can produce more emissions the bigger you are, which eliminated the ability for a smaller truck with the same size bed producing half the emissions... because the target was impractical and expensive to reach


[03-Dec-24 02:53 PM] realharvey#0000
Lol thanks for the research. This explains the big vehicle trend


[03-Dec-24 02:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[03-Dec-24 03:34 PM] roche3950#0000
the UK’s law regarding regulated parts is actually pretty clever


[03-Dec-24 03:35 PM] roche3950#0000
iirc, the parts that are regulated are the ones that are pressure-bearing


[03-Dec-24 03:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The barrel?


[03-Dec-24 03:36 PM] jcheung#0000

[03-Dec-24 05:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also you can get a piece of plastic or metal shaped 80% like that (usually without the holes for the pins that you can see on the face of that image)... then it doesn't count as a gun. Then everything else, like the barrel, carriage, firing bin, blowback system are just accessories.


[03-Dec-24 05:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Don’t go to Hoffman designs


[03-Dec-24 05:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm very much not a gun person, but I made one just to try it out, and it was pretty easy. I have woodworking experience and other home construction-y hobbies, so milling the lower was pretty straightforward


[03-Dec-24 05:20 PM] tanda#0000
Well, we could always talk about how the ATF considers a rubber band to be a machine gun.

okay i don't actually wish... it's a bad idea
but still


[05-Dec-24 10:49 PM] jcheung#0000
i mean if you have a round trip load going that way i'll do a run for free


[05-Dec-24 10:50 PM] jcheung#0000
...also wish you could subcontract shipments


[05-Dec-24 10:50 PM] jvaler#0000
in ~ a week i'll have however much AL fits in a WCB going ANT -> ZV-194b, then 2 small loads of lfabs going ZV-194b -> Aceland


[05-Dec-24 10:50 PM] jcheung#0000
that would be pretty neat (and follow realism)


[05-Dec-24 10:51 PM] jvaler#0000
the shipment could hitch a ride if you'd like to take those


[05-Dec-24 10:52 PM] jcheung#0000
let's see... this aceland package would take up 23 AL's space or so... hmmm


[05-Dec-24 10:52 PM] jvaler#0000
~40k AIC for the trip? the flight times are pretty short, usually takes me just ~24hrs


[05-Dec-24 10:53 PM] jcheung#0000
how time sensitive is the lfab package?


[05-Dec-24 10:53 PM] jvaler#0000
not at all


[05-Dec-24 10:54 PM] jcheung#0000
sure. i'd be fine with less than 40 though


[05-Dec-24 10:54 PM] jvaler#0000

Welcome to the 21st Century, where unsolicited inquiries basically clog up your fancy phone's notification features. 

Since I'm a ***** living in the 19th Century, only physical letters will draw my attention. Drop a custom signet stamp, on some coloured beeswax, and you're definitely get my attention. But all of this automated stuff via electronic transmission is just too much for me! 😛

I'm definitely a fan of the more managed playstyle. My favorite build in POE 1 was blade vortex, so I'm used to being squishy but high damage


[11-Dec-24 12:44 AM] avalock#0000
ahhhhh yeah


[11-Dec-24 12:44 AM] tanda#0000
freaking adore how I can just solo bosses completely untouched


[11-Dec-24 12:45 AM] avalock#0000
:giggle: same


[11-Dec-24 12:45 AM] tanda#0000
dodge roll added a LOT to the game, but they also have much better boss design


[11-Dec-24 12:45 AM] avalock#0000
I'm thankful they're letting you pass through ads with it now


[11-Dec-24 12:45 AM] avalock#0000
cause like uhhhh


[11-Dec-24 12:45 AM] avalock#0000
I was getting stuck a lot


[11-Dec-24 12:47 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, I was getting stuck quiet a bit on the swarmier adds. It's why I kept the cold aura so far, though I may ditch that now that it's not so bad


[11-Dec-24 12:47 AM] avalock#0000
yeee, I was using uhhhh


[11-Dec-24 12:48 AM] tanda#0000
(It's funny, but I just remembered technically I'm playing a minion build as well)


[11-Dec-24 12:48 AM] tanda#0000
Summon Raging Skulls is a great spirit skill


[11-Dec-24 12:48 AM] avalock#0000
yeeeee


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] avalock#0000
guides are saying i should use that


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] avalock#0000
but imm not following them


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] tanda#0000
I haven't even read a guide yet


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] tanda#0000
I've looked up some info, but no guides


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] avalock#0000
i only read a few to see like uhhh


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] avalock#0000
where people are putting passives


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] tanda#0000
Looking up "do ignites stack" is not the same as looking up what build to use


[11-Dec-24 12:49 AM] avalock#0000
but generally i’ve yolod them


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
:giggle: i experimented with something similar to this


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
i put life steal gem on my doggy


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
and learned


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
it only heals the doggy


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
not me


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] avalock#0000
:giggle:


[11-Dec-24 12:50 AM] tanda#0000
I wasn't sure what defensive build to go for, but the only two ascendancies for Sorc right now are Cold/lightning and Chronomage


[11-Dec-24 12:51 AM] tanda#0000
and Chronomage halves recoup time on damage taken, so I've gone in on recoup


[11-Dec-24 12:51 AM] tanda#0000
since we aren't playing path of life nodes anymore, I plan on going pretty heavy on ES too


[11-Dec-24 12:52 AM] avalock#0000
yeeeee


[11-Dec-24 12:53 AM] avalock#0000
i kinda want to take the amulet passive


[11-Dec-24 12:53 AM] avalock#0000
for the lulz


[11-Dec-24 12:54 AM] tanda#0000
it would need to be a pretty strong amulet to be worth it


[11-Dec-24 12:54 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[11-Dec-24 12:55 AM] tanda#0000
that's also a really good source of spirit for you, so it intrinsically means fewer minions


[11-Dec-24 12:55 AM] avalock#0000
also potentially losing a spirit slot


[11-Dec-24 12:55 AM] avalock#0000
:giggle:


[11-Dec-24 12:55 AM] avalock#0000
honestly i’d just get it for the tooltip


[11-Dec-24 12:56 AM] tanda#0000
it's probably not worth taking before maps is my suspicion


[11-Dec-24 12:56 AM] avalock#0000
yeeee


[11-Dec-24 12:57 AM] tanda#0000
I've had really bad drop luck on even getting amulets, so I don't know what higher tiers look like, but lower tiers are largely defensive


[11-Dec-24 12:57 AM] avalock#0000
im going the boring route of additional curses and some others


[11-Dec-24 12:58 AM] tanda#0000
if you double down on minions, that's not so bad


[11-Dec-24 12:58 AM] avalock#0000
i am basically


[11-Dec-24 12:58 AM] tanda#0000
I'm hoping the wiki gets more usable here soon, there's not even data for skills at this point


[11-Dec-24 12:58 AM] avalock#0000
yeaaaaaah


[11-Dec-24 12:58 AM] avalock#0000
i do like the in game stuff


[11-Dec-24 12:59 AM] avalock#0000
keywords being like linked is big


[11-Dec-24 12:59 AM] tanda#0000
A lot of people are focusing on how the game is worse, but it's so much better than POE1 in so many ways it's not even funny


[11-Dec-24 01:00 AM] avalock#0000
wtf lol


[11-Dec-24 01:00 AM] tanda#0000
there's been a lot of work and a lot of love put into it in just making sure that it's readable to new players


[11-Dec-24 01:00 AM] tanda#0000
I do wish it was a *tad* faster paced than it is, but it'll get there at end game


[11-Dec-24 01:01 AM] tanda#0000
or at least give more than a 10% move speed boost on my boots


[11-Dec-24 01:01 AM] avalock#0000
them adding checkpoint TP is gonna be so good


[11-Dec-24 01:02 AM] tanda#0000
I'm just glad they buffed loot a little bit. It was pretty bad, ngl


[11-Dec-24 01:02 AM] avalock#0000
yeaaaaah


[11-Dec-24 01:02 AM] tanda#0000
since the buff I've gotten like 3 jewelers and a few GCP


[11-Dec-24 01:02 AM] avalock#0000
ooo


[11-Dec-24 01:03 AM] tanda#0000
I've gotten a couple alchs but I think I'll wait and trade on those. My ele res is getting kinda low and gear is not cooperating right now


[11-Dec-24 01:03 AM] avalock#0000
yeaaaah


[11-Dec-24 01:05 AM] avalock#0000
oh ive heard stuff with uhhh melee :hehe:


[11-Dec-24 01:06 AM] tanda#0000
I was never a big fan of melee even in PoE1


[11-Dec-24 01:06 AM] tanda#0000
with a couple exceptions, anyway


[11-Dec-24 01:07 AM] tanda#0000
I remember strongly liking some juggernaught builds


[11-Dec-24 02:13 AM] finestone#0000
I am loving poe2


[11-Dec-24 05:37 AM] jcheung#0000
sorry i let things lapse a bit, maybe next run 😓

I was liking poe2 a lot at the start, the more I played the less I'm into it


[11-Dec-24 02:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
Got to maps last night after ~40hrs played, did like 5 or 6, and quit


[11-Dec-24 02:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
I do not like the mapping at all

[13-Dec-24 11:26 AM] jvaler#0000

[13-Dec-24 11:32 AM] jvaler#0000

[13-Dec-24 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000

so i don’t have to ctr+f all the time


[13-Dec-24 11:44 AM] jvaler#0000

legal age to drink is 18 tho isnt it?


[13-Dec-24 05:03 PM] avalock#0000
not in the US


[13-Dec-24 05:04 PM] realharvey#0000
Oh. well :D


[13-Dec-24 05:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can drive a car (big chunk of metal) at 16 but can drink until 21… in my country we usually stop drinking at 16


[13-Dec-24 05:35 PM] realharvey#0000
you can start drinking beer at 16 in germany. But I dont think that it's a good thing


[13-Dec-24 05:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Some parts in the US you can start driving at 15 and get a learning permit at 14 😆


[13-Dec-24 05:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But yeah smoking, drinking and the like is now all 21 here


[13-Dec-24 05:57 PM] tanda#0000
You can go die for your country 4 years before you're eligible to drink or now (in some states) smoke


[13-Dec-24 05:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
that is wild


[13-Dec-24 06:01 PM] roche3950#0000
the reason is kinda interesting too


[13-Dec-24 06:02 PM] roche3950#0000
tldr feds threatened to cut highway funding to the states bc too many college students were getting killed in drunk driving incidents (read: premature irreversible educated workforce attrition)


[13-Dec-24 06:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
In some states in the US, you can buy a gun legally before you can drink alcohol


[13-Dec-24 06:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
Heck, in my state I think you can even legally carry a firearm before you can drink


[13-Dec-24 06:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
That doesn’t surprise me - my parents told me stories of driving (!!) to a neighboring state to drink when they were younger (I think it was 18 there vs 21 here or something)


[13-Dec-24 07:14 PM] jcheung#0000
dare i ask when you start?


[13-Dec-24 07:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
I mean... I am in florida now, but back in uzbekistan it's 18


[13-Dec-24 07:20 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm joking a little, you said stop at 16 😉


[13-Dec-24 07:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
ah 😅 We started like 12-14


[13-Dec-24 07:21 PM] avalock#0000

[13-Dec-24 08:06 PM] avalock#0000
Dislikes:
- pasta dishes (what i consider pasta-like is essentially lasagna, any pasta noodle, i include mac-and-cheese here)
- any sauce (i dislike the texture it adds to food, usually i use seasonings)
- cooked vegetables (i only like them raw)
- food with bones in it


[13-Dec-24 08:06 PM] tanda#0000
oh look, I'm not alone in my weirdness


[13-Dec-24 08:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can tolerate most of those opinions 😄


[13-Dec-24 08:07 PM] tanda#0000
1) makes me wonder if you've ever had GOOD pasta?
2) oh no
3) oh no
4) oh you're vegan?


[13-Dec-24 08:08 PM] avalock#0000
not vegan, i actually love meat


[13-Dec-24 08:08 PM] roche3950#0000

[13-Dec-24 08:08 PM] jcheung#0000
damnit. uh..... yogurt?


[13-Dec-24 08:08 PM] avalock#0000
uhhhh i probably have i don’t like the texture, how messy it is m, the sound, or the smells


[13-Dec-24 08:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve had yogurt sauces on foods with onion and it works 😄


[13-Dec-24 08:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
But I agree that a yogurt cup with caramelized onions on the bottom probably wouldn’t work


[13-Dec-24 08:09 PM] jcheung#0000
....fruit salad?

[13-Dec-24 08:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
For whatever reason, there’s a sandwich in my family that consists of peanut butter, mayonnaise, cheese, and dill pickles


[13-Dec-24 08:10 PM] jcheung#0000
🤔


[13-Dec-24 08:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
The awful opinion is that it’s actually not bad


[13-Dec-24 08:11 PM] jcheung#0000
first thought: eww
second thought: i would have to try it before fully passing judgement


[13-Dec-24 08:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s pretty much how I felt about it haha


[13-Dec-24 08:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have made them of my own free will before, but mainly out of nostalgia


[13-Dec-24 08:12 PM] avalock#0000
the only thing i like out of this is the pickles btw


[13-Dec-24 08:12 PM] avalock#0000
i dont like cheese


[13-Dec-24 08:12 PM] avalock#0000
or mayo


[13-Dec-24 08:12 PM] avalock#0000
also peanut butter is gross to me


[13-Dec-24 08:13 PM] roche3950#0000
ham
pickles
ketchup
lightly toasted bread


[13-Dec-24 08:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
So what sorts of things do you typically eat @avalock ?


[13-Dec-24 08:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t know how to say that without sounding mean - just curious about favorite/safe foods 😅


[13-Dec-24 08:18 PM] avalock#0000
unfortunately i eat like shit rn, but when i’m not, i like to cook myself steak or chicken with roasted potatoes, or usually have like a small salad with no dressing on  the side

My bad food opinion is that I only eat like every 10-12 hours


[13-Dec-24 08:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
At first when you sent the dislikes I thought it sounded pretty rough, but with the context of what things you like it doesn’t feel as controversial. I’d miss pasta though 😄


[13-Dec-24 08:24 PM] tanda#0000
"lunch" at 10am, dinner at like 5pm

It's quite useful in the GL production, that is then used in PP2 recipes.. Ohh yea and THF... I haven't seen much mass use of NA other than those.. A very good joke though!

If we ever had to do a friendly competition with another faction, I'd like our prize to be that they have to ship our entire (cx/faction wide) stock of na to their cx, so that we can sell it there

@razenpok does importing data merge them or replace them?

Replace


[19-Dec-24 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000

[19-Dec-24 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000
Any possibility to merge ?

[19-Dec-24 12:40 PM] razenpok#0000
Merging is a bit tricky


[19-Dec-24 12:40 PM] razenpok#0000
There are a lot of things and it's not always clear how to merge some of them


[19-Dec-24 12:41 PM] laaxus#0000
😦


[19-Dec-24 12:42 PM] razenpok#0000
For example: financial history, which data points to take? Only the most recent ones of any specific day?


[19-Dec-24 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000
Most récent is ok


[19-Dec-24 12:45 PM] laaxus#0000
In theory, it shouldn't change a lot in the same day


[19-Dec-24 12:46 PM] razenpok#0000
Ok, then consider this case: financial history is indirectly using "MM Materials" and "Ignored Materials". If you change those, they will affect your financial data. And let's say one machine has changes in those and records a data point. After 5 minutes a different machine will record a new data point. During a merge, you will lose a data point where "MM Materials" and "Ignored Materials" were changed


[19-Dec-24 12:47 PM] razenpok#0000
And that's just one example


[19-Dec-24 12:47 PM] razenpok#0000
Modifying sorting modes, for example, can produce literal merge conflicts if you edit the same thing on two machines

Technically, it's not just *you* who told it to do smth, but also all people that made the stuff you use (frameworks, libraries, compilers, OS, etc)

[21-Dec-24 11:05 PM] jvaler#0000
the ships look really pretty, but the trailer videos are 90% cinematic shots and little gameplay :/


[21-Dec-24 11:06 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, Sins is more an RTS


[21-Dec-24 11:06 PM] manhim#0000
Kinda like StarCraft in space


[21-Dec-24 11:06 PM] tanda#0000
it's an RTS, not too far from old school starcraft


[21-Dec-24 11:07 PM] tanda#0000
And SOSE2 is pretty much the same game, with a new expansion and an updated engine


[21-Dec-24 11:07 PM] tanda#0000

not as good as the 90% stellaris but i feel like i'll like it better


[21-Dec-24 11:09 PM] manhim#0000
I've held off X4 cause of the reviews. But I have no clue if they have merit.


[21-Dec-24 11:10 PM] jvaler#0000
really? on steam it's got 89% recently positive and 79% alltime positive

Mmm, might be mixing up two games


[21-Dec-24 11:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i've heard people talk about "X4-like games" and never really understood what it meant cause i've never played an X_ game, but based on the trailer and screenshots it looks like a better galaxy on fire 2


[21-Dec-24 11:12 PM] jvaler#0000

that is, if i don't like it


[21-Dec-24 11:18 PM] tanda#0000

I’ve never played it


[22-Dec-24 02:12 AM] getonthetrain#0000
I got over 300 hours in it and still want to play more


[22-Dec-24 02:13 AM] getonthetrain#0000
autobattler with cards, spells, unit upgrades - like a robot rock/paper/scissors/chess but with the right upgrades on your units you can change their whole dynamic


[22-Dec-24 02:15 AM] getonthetrain#0000
really good value for $10


[22-Dec-24 03:33 AM] realharvey#0000
I played the beta. I refuse to buy it because it would be better as a f2p game honestly


[22-Dec-24 03:44 AM] jcheung#0000
I gave up after a couple fights


[22-Dec-24 03:44 AM] jcheung#0000

I played it a bit. I love my life-sharing tanks


[22-Dec-24 02:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Placed like 6 next to each other and managed to kill any single-target enemies fast enough


[22-Dec-24 04:21 PM] .shiva.#0000
Mechabellum is great


[22-Dec-24 04:22 PM] .shiva.#0000
Huge disagree on it being better as f2p though, it's not a game that works well enough for skins / any of the normal f2p models


[22-Dec-24 04:23 PM] .shiva.#0000
But yeah you need to play enough to get at the right rank, and then a bit of basic knowledge / game feel will let you climb pretty fast


[22-Dec-24 04:26 PM] roche3950#0000
Sledgefang when in doubt, indeed


[22-Dec-24 05:46 PM] finestone#0000
100% should have gone Legion TD2 model of just upfront price with skins.


[22-Dec-24 05:48 PM] .shiva.#0000
That's what it is?


[22-Dec-24 05:48 PM] .shiva.#0000

already on the way, or not yet


[28-Dec-24 12:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
not yet


[28-Dec-24 12:16 AM] jcheung#0000

[28-Dec-24 12:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
I can do a LCB or WCB depending on what you're shipping


[28-Dec-24 12:17 AM] jcheung#0000
annoying bit for me is that i've tried sending this darn ship 2x and sent to wrong place twice 😂


[28-Dec-24 12:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
hopefully third time's the charm 😄


[28-Dec-24 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
think there will be room on backhaul? 👀


[28-Dec-24 12:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
yup, the whole ship


[28-Dec-24 12:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
i sell everything I make to a corpmate on site


[28-Dec-24 12:23 AM] jcheung#0000
which ship you thinking? i'll change the package based on that-have MCG


[28-Dec-24 12:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
LCB, since it turns out I needed my last WCB for Nike 😅


[28-Dec-24 12:24 AM] jcheung#0000

[28-Dec-24 12:25 AM] jcheung#0000
as far as nike goes, uhm


[28-Dec-24 12:26 AM] jcheung#0000
are you hauling AL? if yes, i have an offer for you. have 1k AL at 194d if you want to do an in-system haul


[28-Dec-24 12:27 AM] jcheung#0000
idk if it's faster than going back to wherever you store your AL 😄


[28-Dec-24 12:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
the CX is where I store my AL 😛


[28-Dec-24 12:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
but would totally swing by and pick it up there, just name your price - happy to match CX prices


[28-Dec-24 12:29 AM] jcheung#0000
...bid or ask, because i think evayoo just shot up the ask prices


[28-Dec-24 12:29 AM] jcheung#0000
errr


[28-Dec-24 12:29 AM] jcheung#0000
not evayoo


[28-Dec-24 12:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
ask, because I'd be paying that anyway, and it might as well go to a trusted ADI member 🙂

[28-Dec-24 12:33 AM] sidepipe#0000

[28-Dec-24 12:34 AM] jcheung#0000
looks good


[28-Dec-24 12:34 AM] jcheung#0000
re-did the backhaul


[28-Dec-24 12:35 AM] jcheung#0000
one day i'll manage to send conts without screwing it up-not today though


[28-Dec-24 12:36 AM] sidepipe#0000

Ah, but how many follow conservation 😉


[28-Dec-24 11:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
I found one that’s apparently a “white-hot romance series” according to good reads reviews, but I assume that’s not what you’re reading


[28-Dec-24 11:12 AM] jcheung#0000
🤔


[28-Dec-24 11:12 AM] jcheung#0000
I don't think it quite qualifies for that, no

[28-Dec-24 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
Is it a certain Baldwin’s Legacy series?

i saw multiple texas plates driving in which seems strange


[28-Dec-24 07:55 PM] jvaler#0000
they have their own gulf, and drive a huge distance which passes through multiple other states with gulfs

It's wild how many Nevada and Utah plates I see here in rural CA


[28-Dec-24 07:56 PM] tanda#0000
I've heard multiple people say they just register their cars out of state to avoid paying CA's tag rates

florida has very, very high humidity

I need to vent


[10-Jan-25 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
and I feel like this is the only place that might understand me


[10-Jan-25 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
so bear me out


[10-Jan-25 01:46 PM] laaxus#0000
in my economic simulator, I tried to give a supply curve with a positive slop for an hypothetic farm


[10-Jan-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
so my idea was to give a distribution curve to the plot of land of each farm, with its productivity


[10-Jan-25 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
using the formula (30/(b-a)^5) (x-a)^2(x-b)^2
Which has the nice property of having null derivative at a and b, and having an integral of 1


[10-Jan-25 01:52 PM] laaxus#0000
here's what it looks like for a = 1 and b = 4

[10-Jan-25 01:53 PM] laaxus#0000
I thought it was a nice function, way easier than gaussian that are unlimited and would require the use of erf
however, to make it usable, I first need to know, if a farmer use 20% of his land, what is the average productivity (assuming he use the 20% most productive part) ?


[10-Jan-25 01:55 PM] laaxus#0000
after all, I would need that so I can know the total production depending on his use of land


[10-Jan-25 01:55 PM] laaxus#0000
well after hours of tries and error, I finally found the answer and its this : (replace 80 with a, and 90 with b)

[10-Jan-25 01:56 PM] laaxus#0000
This is clearly unusable in any kind of code, but just for the sake of the exercise I tried to continue


[10-Jan-25 01:56 PM] laaxus#0000
however, I was faced with a wall


[10-Jan-25 01:56 PM] laaxus#0000
Indeed, the next step was to calculate the supply curve, which is the marginal cost curve


[10-Jan-25 01:58 PM] laaxus#0000
or, said in another word "Given the % of use of land, what is the productivity of the next best piece of land"


[10-Jan-25 01:58 PM] laaxus#0000
or in mathematical term : I need the inverse of the integral of that formula


[10-Jan-25 02:00 PM] laaxus#0000
which is straight impossible

[10-Jan-25 02:36 PM] laaxus#0000
In short I wanted to use a gaussian like curve because it was cool


[10-Jan-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
but it is completely unusable in practice


[10-Jan-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
so now I have to consider a fucking triangle


[10-Jan-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
and even the triangle might be too much


[10-Jan-25 02:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
are you able to plug this into some algebraic calculator and simplify it? it looks like two polynomials


[10-Jan-25 02:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
though I guess even if it does simplify a lot, that's not really that useful since it's not in terms of a and b


[10-Jan-25 02:47 PM] laaxus#0000
** that's the simplified version **


[10-Jan-25 02:47 PM] laaxus#0000
you don't want to know what kind of pain I've been through


[10-Jan-25 02:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, doesn't seem to go much further


[10-Jan-25 02:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
i tried to do the old reliable let z = (90-x(90-80)) and simplify that way

[10-Jan-25 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
which gets you here, which isn't much better (esp once you plug back in that substituted value)


[10-Jan-25 02:57 PM] laaxus#0000
forget it, it's unusable just because of the inverse


[10-Jan-25 02:57 PM] laaxus#0000
the triangle one is more promising


[10-Jan-25 02:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
bored at work 😄


[10-Jan-25 02:58 PM] roche3950#0000
We can play with it later if peeps want :3


[10-Jan-25 02:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I was trying to think of what sort of function you could use that's both simpler and still interesting, but no clue


[10-Jan-25 02:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
it might be trivial but sometimes chatgpt helps me to see options I can't see


[10-Jan-25 02:59 PM] laaxus#0000
none
The only usable one right now is a triangle (which is basically a line)


[10-Jan-25 02:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
constant productivity might be simpler, but it fails the 'still interesting' criteria


[10-Jan-25 03:00 PM] laaxus#0000
this gives me the following function for the average(x : land usage [0->1]) = b -2(b-a)x/3


[10-Jan-25 03:01 PM] laaxus#0000
this gives me a flat supply curve, which is ... not great


[10-Jan-25 03:03 PM] laaxus#0000
My issue with constant productivity is that I have not implemented wage yet


[10-Jan-25 03:03 PM] laaxus#0000
for now, all the earning of a company is given back to the worker


[10-Jan-25 03:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
just out of curiosity - what conditions does this function need to satisfy?


[10-Jan-25 03:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
based????


[10-Jan-25 03:05 PM] laaxus#0000
Let lower_bound = a, upper_bound = b
integral of f(x) from a -> b = 1
f(x) >= 0 in the interval [a, b]
ideally, f(b) = 0


[10-Jan-25 03:06 PM] laaxus#0000
truly based, the issue is that without per hour wage, the cost per hour is 0 which does not help


[10-Jan-25 03:06 PM] laaxus#0000
as the supply curve = the marginal cost curve


[10-Jan-25 03:07 PM] laaxus#0000
if there's no marginal cost ... well there's no supply curve


[10-Jan-25 03:10 PM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, I think I'll implement it this way :
- One random double determining the land productivity (constant)
- One random double determining this recolt productivity (change each production cycle)
- constant wage / h when h < 8
- exponential wage / h when >= 8


[10-Jan-25 03:10 PM] roche3950#0000
Yeah I was looking through this I feel like you can set parameters for land productivity


[10-Jan-25 03:11 PM] roche3950#0000
Make it random or pseudorandom for the distribution of nutrients in the soil


[10-Jan-25 03:11 PM] laaxus#0000
this way, there's a marginal cost, therefore a supply curve, and then with the exponential bit, I'm quite sure the supply curve will cross the demand curve


[10-Jan-25 03:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
so so close to e^-x being suitable smh


[10-Jan-25 03:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
but that only works if your lower bound is 0 (reasonable) and your upper bound is infinity (probably not realistic?)


[10-Jan-25 03:15 PM] laaxus#0000
the issue with e


[10-Jan-25 03:15 PM] laaxus#0000
is that this productivity curve would become the supply curve


[10-Jan-25 03:15 PM] laaxus#0000
but only of one farm


[10-Jan-25 03:15 PM] laaxus#0000
to get the MARKET supply curve, I'll have to sum every farm supply curve


[10-Jan-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
so it needs to be easy enough that additions works


[10-Jan-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
so yeah


[10-Jan-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
there's many cool things


[10-Jan-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
but if I want to keep things easy and performant code wise, I'll have to simplify things


[10-Jan-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
and approximate as much as I can


[10-Jan-25 03:17 PM] laaxus#0000
oh, another requirement


[10-Jan-25 03:17 PM] laaxus#0000
it must be simple enough money don't exit the economy because of floating point error


[10-Jan-25 03:17 PM] laaxus#0000
🙂


[10-Jan-25 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
we had a big data pipeline at work that was doing financial calculations with floating point numbers


[10-Jan-25 03:18 PM] laaxus#0000
(i'm sorry V3 devs, I was wrong, you were right, I understand why you implement your economy like this, I'm sorry I'm so sorry)


[10-Jan-25 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
it was a lot of fun explaining to actuaries why the results were different every time it was run


[10-Jan-25 03:21 PM] laaxus#0000
I can imagine ^^


[10-Jan-25 03:22 PM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, I'm quite happy with the simulation as it is, it's a simple as it can be, but prices automatically rises when liquidity is injected, and goes down when liquidity is removed


[10-Jan-25 03:23 PM] laaxus#0000
it's not much but it's honest work


[10-Jan-25 05:53 PM] evov#0000
I'd say the main issue is that you're trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

[21-Jan-25 11:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i feel very adult


[21-Jan-25 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Once I wanted to rent a uhaul to move my small apartment... but they were all sold out.. so I ended up going to this industrial supplier near my place and rented a whole giant box truck for about the same price. It all worked out but I would not recommend that 😄

{Reactions}
fishahhh 

[21-Jan-25 11:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
In hind sight I think renting not a uhaul would've been better


[21-Jan-25 11:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
like I think uh home depot cargo van would've been cheaper


[21-Jan-25 11:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
did the box truck have a lift?


[21-Jan-25 11:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope


[21-Jan-25 11:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
It had a pull out ramp but it was semi-trailer height, so it was a whole thing


[21-Jan-25 11:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
it didn't really fit in the apartment parking lot.. and when the ramp was out, it definitely didn't fit 😄


[21-Jan-25 11:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
heh that's a good like 4 feet off the ground


[21-Jan-25 11:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, turns out you can reserve uhauls ahead of time... and also everyone needs to move on the last day of the month


[21-Jan-25 11:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
heh yeah I just needed to move exercise equipment and my car is too smol


[21-Jan-25 11:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah


[21-Jan-25 11:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
idk if i wanna drive a box truck or similar again


[21-Jan-25 11:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
they're huge and have no visibility


[21-Jan-25 11:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I hope you told your apartment complex to add a loading dock for big box trucks


[21-Jan-25 11:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
😄


[21-Jan-25 11:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the guy at the yard just was like: "Yeah this is just your usual diesel automatic box truck, 20 yards. Uh.. okay here's the keys."


[21-Jan-25 11:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
whatever size it was, it was just under the size of an articulated semi truck


[21-Jan-25 11:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
so it was huge


[21-Jan-25 11:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
It was clear I wasn't gonna get any more instructions, so I just went for it heh


[21-Jan-25 11:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol wut a 20yrd long box truck?


[21-Jan-25 11:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh probs foot


[21-Jan-25 11:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
still big tho lol


[21-Jan-25 11:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
what was the brand of the truck?


[21-Jan-25 11:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh yeah I don't remember


[21-Jan-25 11:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I remember them saying I had insurance on the truck, but not the box... so don't mess up the box cause you gotta pay out of pocket for it


[21-Jan-25 11:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
honestly I thought I had a picture but I can't find it


[21-Jan-25 11:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
was it a cab over?

I just like trucks


[21-Jan-25 11:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
and it was from a place that mostly rented excavators and other industrial stuff, or renting trucks was definitely a random side business


[21-Jan-25 11:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[21-Jan-25 11:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
heh invite me over


[21-Jan-25 11:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
my friend rented a small backhoe kinda excavator and I guess it was actually pretty cheap


[21-Jan-25 11:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
and I think all he was doing was setting up raised bed garden plots


[21-Jan-25 11:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ooh i'd be down to drive one of those too


[22-Jan-25 08:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
if they have the lift gates, the professional trucks are much better than the uhauls for the same length though.


[22-Jan-25 08:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
especially if you have a dock on one end of the trip


[22-Jan-25 09:53 AM] roche3950#0000
You can rent these at Home Depot I think


[22-Jan-25 09:53 AM] roche3950#0000

You don't need a CDL for something like that over there?


[22-Jan-25 10:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess you're good up to 26,000  pounds which gets you to a 26 foot box usually?


[22-Jan-25 10:50 AM] archielvahr#0000

no idea how this is calculated so no idea why its going down


[31-Jan-25 03:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
ohhhh


[31-Jan-25 03:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
equity is value - liabilities


[31-Jan-25 03:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
so because I took loans its going down


[31-Jan-25 03:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
still D:


[31-Jan-25 04:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sounds like your production can support the loan


[31-Jan-25 04:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Therefore you’re “loosing” money


[31-Jan-25 06:08 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Could also be things like the component values of ships dropping (even before depreciation), which for a relatively new player can be a significant part of your net worth.  (My 2 starter ships show about a 1M loss in pre-depreciation value since 1/26, visible in XIT FINBS if you have refined prun).


[31-Jan-25 06:10 AM] realharvey#0000
others would have a similiar dip aswell then


[31-Jan-25 06:10 AM] realharvey#0000
I dont


[31-Jan-25 06:11 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I mean, my dip and Appletree's seem about the same.


[31-Jan-25 06:11 AM] laaxus#0000
The chart not starting at 0 makes it look worse than it actually is


[31-Jan-25 06:12 AM] laaxus#0000
It could just be DW Price going down


[31-Jan-25 06:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I had a dip the last days, too. Thought it was because of something else


[31-Jan-25 06:12 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, looks like that chart has about 800k to 850k loss total, so, some profit plus ship cost dropping (or other inventory dropping in value).


[31-Jan-25 06:12 AM] realharvey#0000
good catch! We are just talking about >0 Mio difference


[31-Jan-25 06:13 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I will say I don't understand why regular FINBS (not XIT FINBS) shows 0 value for owned ships -- at least when you only have the 2 starters.


[31-Jan-25 06:15 AM] realharvey#0000
FINBS has no real valueable information which is why XIT FINBS exists

but that's just one cell


[01-Feb-25 12:03 PM] jcheung#0000
you could just do `='FIO data'!F255`


[01-Feb-25 12:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
and i use =sum to give me a value thats in a single different cell

oh rly?


[01-Feb-25 12:03 PM] jcheung#0000

[01-Feb-25 12:03 PM] jcheung#0000
use sum when there's more than one value


[01-Feb-25 12:04 PM] jcheung#0000
like `sum(a1:a99)`


[01-Feb-25 12:04 PM] jcheung#0000
or `sum(1,2,3)`


[01-Feb-25 12:04 PM] pagy1234#0000

How long until we bring up pivot tables 😁


[01-Feb-25 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
well


[01-Feb-25 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
that's because you wouldn't write it like that

[01-Feb-25 12:15 PM] tanda#0000
Pivot tables are brilliant and I don't know how I lived without them


[01-Feb-25 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
it would be `=minus(product(2,2),4)` to get `2*2-4`


[01-Feb-25 12:15 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh lol


[01-Feb-25 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
i still haven't messed with pivots

[01-Feb-25 12:16 PM] tanda#0000
They make everything related to large data sets immensely easier


[01-Feb-25 12:16 PM] jvaler#0000
what are pivot tables actually for? i use arrayformulas and they don't seem compatible with them


[01-Feb-25 12:16 PM] sidepipe#0000

whaat


[01-Feb-25 12:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
anywhere that you have a table full of keys (like different items at different planets) and values (like how many and what they're worth in $$$ terms)


[01-Feb-25 12:17 PM] tanda#0000
so you can generate a column in a pivot table1 that searches pivot table2 to see if the result is in pivot table 2 and if so, you can then filter pivot table1 by that column


[01-Feb-25 12:17 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh yeah that looks alot nicer


[01-Feb-25 12:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can group those and sort / filter by the keys and summarize the values


[01-Feb-25 12:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
so you could answer questions like "how many RATs do I have stored at all of my bases"

[02-Feb-25 01:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, I think that’s right for what you have set up. Two columns per ticker and price


[02-Feb-25 01:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i wouldn't want 2 columns though lol, i'd want the calculated grand total price underneath the price per unit


[02-Feb-25 01:28 PM] jvaler#0000
wait oh i see what's happening, all the data has to stay inside the grid, so adding another value has to add another column


[02-Feb-25 01:28 PM] jvaler#0000
rip


[02-Feb-25 01:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I'm not 100% sure if / how you could do that, since the grand total is usually supposed to be the same as the value in the column


[02-Feb-25 01:30 PM] jcheung#0000
so i know how i would do it, but the formatting would look different and it would only use the pivot table as a data source


[02-Feb-25 01:31 PM] jcheung#0000

[02-Feb-25 02:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
Tbh, I would just use the pivot table to generate the data and then reference it in another tab with formatting


[02-Feb-25 02:29 PM] jvaler#0000
wait woah i didn't realize the web publish link is the same as the .csv just with a url change


[02-Feb-25 02:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's how I usually approach it


[02-Feb-25 02:29 PM] jcheung#0000
i decided i wanted to skip pivots because i didn't feel like figuring them out 😄


[02-Feb-25 02:30 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe this ugly thing could have been prevented if i tried this out sooner lol

[02-Feb-25 02:32 PM] jcheung#0000
i would use reduce for that, though i suppose it would depend entirely on how performance felt


[02-Feb-25 02:32 PM] jvaler#0000
reduce?


[02-Feb-25 02:33 PM] jvaler#0000
oh that uses lambda, i'm too stupid for that


[02-Feb-25 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000

that's not true


[02-Feb-25 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
it's tricky for sure

if i had to guess, because i'm struggling to understand the flow of this (there's some stuff i'm not familiar with in here) it's doing a bunch of stuff that probably doesn't need to be done

can someone help me


[04-Feb-25 05:40 AM] garoo2004#0000
i see that in prunplanner, producing C from HCP, MAI, GRN formula has negative ROI


[04-Feb-25 05:41 AM] garoo2004#0000
but if i completely supply the ingredients on my own (no buying) is this still the case?


[04-Feb-25 05:44 AM] garoo2004#0000
as in one base dedicated on farming the plants, and the other burns  them all


[04-Feb-25 05:46 AM] laaxus#0000
It's really hard to have absolute négative profits


[04-Feb-25 05:46 AM] laaxus#0000
But very easy to have relative négative profits


[04-Feb-25 05:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Using your own inputs Can increase profits in some case


[04-Feb-25 05:47 AM] laaxus#0000
But it dépends on many things


[04-Feb-25 05:47 AM] laaxus#0000
What are your CX settings on prunplanner ?


[04-Feb-25 05:47 AM] garoo2004#0000
antares


[04-Feb-25 05:48 AM] garoo2004#0000
its probably due to how C bid price is a bit cheaper here, i think


[04-Feb-25 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
Not what I mean

ok that's bad


[04-Feb-25 05:56 AM] laaxus#0000
you should buy at buy


[04-Feb-25 05:57 AM] laaxus#0000
and sell at sell


[04-Feb-25 05:57 AM] laaxus#0000
like my screen above

Depends


[04-Feb-25 05:57 AM] laaxus#0000
he'll learn the edge cases later on


[04-Feb-25 05:58 AM] laaxus#0000
A beginner *should* start with buy at buy and sell at sell


[04-Feb-25 05:58 AM] laaxus#0000
And I still use that settings

i still dont remember the abbreviations


[04-Feb-25 06:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Just to have it said - this might distort your prices for some market, especially if the bid/ask orders aren’t reasonable


[04-Feb-25 06:00 AM] laaxus#0000
it will ome with time


[04-Feb-25 06:00 AM] laaxus#0000
and that's kinda the point

They did a good job so far


[04-Feb-25 06:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You’ll learn the truth early enough


[04-Feb-25 06:02 AM] garoo2004#0000
so, is it profitable to make a dedicated inc base?


[04-Feb-25 06:03 AM] garoo2004#0000
and another dedicated base to supply the mai grn and hcp


[04-Feb-25 06:03 AM] garoo2004#0000
thank you


[04-Feb-25 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Let me quickly get into the discussion 🧐


[04-Feb-25 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Soo, you want to produce C yourself


[04-Feb-25 06:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Do you want to sell it or use it internally?


[04-Feb-25 06:05 AM] garoo2004#0000
well i thought of selling them


[04-Feb-25 06:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
With the corrected Cx settings, what does PP say about your plan?


[04-Feb-25 06:06 AM] garoo2004#0000
i think i will still make profits, its just that ill lose some potential profits


[04-Feb-25 06:06 AM] garoo2004#0000
due to how lucrative i can sell the plants as they are


[04-Feb-25 06:07 AM] garoo2004#0000

[04-Feb-25 06:08 AM] garoo2004#0000
so i feel like this doesnt mean ill lose 40.5k every day, rather im missing out on extra 40.5k profits'


[04-Feb-25 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There are multiple recipes for C - not all of them have the same profit margin


[04-Feb-25 06:09 AM] garoo2004#0000
yeah, but im trying to make the maximum output possible haha


[04-Feb-25 06:09 AM] garoo2004#0000
just for the lolz


[04-Feb-25 06:09 AM] garoo2004#0000
again, i think this is the case


[04-Feb-25 06:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
PP calculates the prices by checking how much you would need to pay for the inputs, if you buy them completely from the market - which is most of the time more expensive them producing them yourself.


[04-Feb-25 06:10 AM] garoo2004#0000
yep, and since the ingredients are more expensive than the C, i couldve just sell them instead


[04-Feb-25 06:11 AM] garoo2004#0000
hence, my hyposthesis: im missing out the extra 40k profits


[04-Feb-25 06:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Simply spoken, yes


[04-Feb-25 06:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It basically costs you to produce carbon with that recipe


[04-Feb-25 06:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But for example the 4 GRN to Carbon recipe is profitable, so there are ways to make a profit from making carbon


[04-Feb-25 06:14 AM] garoo2004#0000
yeah, but the output volume is substantially smaller than this setup


[04-Feb-25 06:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It is, but still cheaper 😅😂


[04-Feb-25 06:15 AM] garoo2004#0000
using grn i make about 300k/day, but with current setup, i make 600k/day

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Feb-25 06:16 AM] garoo2004#0000
haha, and i have nowhere nearly enough logistics capability to do this


[04-Feb-25 06:16 AM] garoo2004#0000
so this is still just a faraway dream


[04-Feb-25 06:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Ah, I think im picking up what you’re putting down


[04-Feb-25 06:16 AM] garoo2004#0000
i named my company CarbonCG, after all


[04-Feb-25 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sure, the 3 input recipe is the most efficient and technically most profitable recipe if you produce all the inputs yourself


[04-Feb-25 06:17 AM] garoo2004#0000
uh huh


[04-Feb-25 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But it’s kinda advanced, especially for new players


[04-Feb-25 06:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There are corporations doing it that way


[04-Feb-25 06:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I don’t have the exact numbers, but to feed a single full INC base you need multiple farming bases iirc


[04-Feb-25 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
just so you know, it's extremely complicated to do one industry only


[04-Feb-25 06:21 AM] laaxus#0000
you can click on the recipe and instantly see which one is profitable


[04-Feb-25 06:21 AM] laaxus#0000
C extraction is low profit but C price is very constant (there's something like a lobby keeping the price stuck at 700)


[04-Feb-25 06:22 AM] laaxus#0000
this however says nothing about input prices


[04-Feb-25 06:22 AM] garoo2004#0000
well technically im doing multiple industry, RIG, INC and FRM


[04-Feb-25 06:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Glad it’s just a lobby and not a mafia 😂


[04-Feb-25 06:23 AM] garoo2004#0000
indeed


[04-Feb-25 06:23 AM] garoo2004#0000
ive planned out two farming bases already hehe


[04-Feb-25 06:23 AM] laaxus#0000
afaik, one input recipe is what maximize profit for carbon


[04-Feb-25 06:23 AM] laaxus#0000
don't mess with the carbon brothers


[04-Feb-25 06:23 AM] garoo2004#0000
this


[04-Feb-25 06:24 AM] garoo2004#0000
i think its like you said, its relative roi


[04-Feb-25 06:24 AM] garoo2004#0000
it assumes me buying plants from cx


[04-Feb-25 06:24 AM] garoo2004#0000
in actuality im still profitting 600k/day


[04-Feb-25 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
there's one zero too many there


[04-Feb-25 06:25 AM] garoo2004#0000
here


[04-Feb-25 06:25 AM] garoo2004#0000
oh sorry 400k


[04-Feb-25 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
basically, this shows it would be better for you to sell your greens on the market


[04-Feb-25 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
than refine them into C


[04-Feb-25 06:26 AM] garoo2004#0000
correct haha


[04-Feb-25 06:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
To make clear what Laaxus probably ment:
the way the permit system is structured In this game forces you to have bases on multiple planets. Good planets with the fitting COGCs for an industry are limited and therefore limiting the expansion, making it more and more difficult to expand one specific material/production line.


[04-Feb-25 06:29 AM] garoo2004#0000
oh yeah the bases i mentioned are stationed separately


[04-Feb-25 06:29 AM] garoo2004#0000
if not, iim missing out on that juicy cogc buff


[04-Feb-25 06:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000

One of the things that kills me about AGRI goods in general is kinda called out in this point right here


[04-Feb-25 06:51 AM] tanda#0000
PRUNplanner assumes all base inputs and outputs are sold on the CX. Which is unreasonable for raw goods like MAI/GRN/HCP


[04-Feb-25 06:51 AM] garoo2004#0000
and h20 too


[04-Feb-25 06:51 AM] tanda#0000
The times I have listed raw agri goods on the CX, the stacks I've sold sometimes takes 2-3 weeks to sell through


[04-Feb-25 06:52 AM] tanda#0000
So profit calcs based on the CX especially for C are sometimes flat wrong


[04-Feb-25 06:52 AM] garoo2004#0000
yeah, ive started looking the profits at the in/out table now


[04-Feb-25 06:53 AM] garoo2004#0000
after this conversation, i got the revelation


[04-Feb-25 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
So PRUNplanner can tell you you're losing money doing triple burn all it wants, chances are you're probably not, because you can sell the extra C you produce much faster than you can sell that extra input (GRN/MAI)


[04-Feb-25 06:55 AM] garoo2004#0000
how about HER, do they sell fast?


[04-Feb-25 06:55 AM] garoo2004#0000
my corp have been advising me to sell those


[04-Feb-25 06:56 AM] pxlfox.#0000
HER is kinda a trend right now


[04-Feb-25 06:57 AM] tanda#0000
HER got wiped off the market due to a FIM spike a couple months ago


[04-Feb-25 06:57 AM] tanda#0000
we're just now in the downward trend phase, but HER will sell


[04-Feb-25 07:05 AM] garoo2004#0000
i see


[04-Feb-25 07:19 AM] tanda#0000
Another tool PRUNplanner exposes to you is the COGM screen

that thing is impossible to use


[04-Feb-25 08:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
like actually hurts by brain


[04-Feb-25 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
it's not that hard


[04-Feb-25 08:52 AM] laaxus#0000
what are you struggling with


[04-Feb-25 08:54 AM] jcheung#0000
so what you would do, is you would take the i/o of each base.... find out what the final product and surplus sells for, then divide by number of bases


[04-Feb-25 08:55 AM] jcheung#0000
so hypothetically if you have 2 bases, HYF and INC, and you produce perfectly the right amount from HYF to use in INC (rarely the case)


[04-Feb-25 08:56 AM] jcheung#0000
you would take whatever the INC output would be, subtract the cost of both base's worth of feedstock, then divide by two


[04-Feb-25 08:57 AM] jcheung#0000
the full burn C costs a lot more input for the same output, so if you're looking purely for profit.... it may not be the most ideal. or it might.


[04-Feb-25 09:24 AM] garoo2004#0000
something like that, yes


[04-Feb-25 09:26 AM] garoo2004#0000
my rough estimation is around 100k revenue, not profit yet


[04-Feb-25 09:27 AM] garoo2004#0000
divide by 3 bases, cuz the inc are hungry af


[04-Feb-25 09:27 AM] laaxus#0000
don't start something that isn't immediately profitable


[04-Feb-25 09:27 AM] garoo2004#0000
true that


[04-Feb-25 09:27 AM] garoo2004#0000
currently im setting up for HER farm


[04-Feb-25 09:32 AM] garoo2004#0000
eh no, the 100k IS profit, though not totally clean yet cuz im too lazy to account for the dw and rat. revenue would be 240k


[04-Feb-25 09:33 AM] garoo2004#0000
anyway, waiting for people to sell me the required construction materials are too boring


[04-Feb-25 09:33 AM] garoo2004#0000
should i just immediately buy at their ask price


[04-Feb-25 09:33 AM] garoo2004#0000
it has been 6days into the game but my base hasnt even fully started yet


[04-Feb-25 09:36 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
some construction materials are effectively only really supplied by their market maker (npc), so you have to buy them immediately if you want them.  You'll see those as having infinite quantity sell orders. 

BSE is a good example.  (and it looks like you are the highest bid below that market maker)


[04-Feb-25 09:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I never sell my construction pfabs to bid


[04-Feb-25 09:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
also, you can get good deal via #internal-offers


[04-Feb-25 09:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
especially bfabs are getting sold really fast. Margin on those aren't great, so there is no reason to sell them for basically production costs


[04-Feb-25 09:43 AM] garoo2004#0000
i see


[04-Feb-25 09:43 AM] garoo2004#0000
i guess ill just buy from the npc


[04-Feb-25 09:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
again, check the #internal-offers and send some privat contracts, if you can. The prices for the bfabs are really good


[04-Feb-25 09:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
if they have any on stock


[04-Feb-25 09:56 AM] garoo2004#0000
ill check it out


[04-Feb-25 09:56 AM] garoo2004#0000
thank you!


[04-Feb-25 02:18 PM] bookliko#0000
@garoo2004 to expend on this feature: you can add internal production costs as Empire Material "BUY". This way you can set your GRN/HCP/MAI input at internal prices. same for other MAT's you produce.

fyi, "avg" is the ingame "average", which is actually just whatever the last transaction was. for an actual average, scroll down to the "pp7d" options.

and also you're in antares, not castillo-ito =P

I'd imagine he blocked people because he's an adult. And rather than try to dictate how everyone else should act or behave around him, he just took ownership over his environment and chose to limit what he see's / hears. +1 imo. But I also think it's 50/50 that he's someone's malfunctioning chatbot project, so wtf do I know.

Turns out the exit says Heidenau~~ (A17 near Dresden)~~, so nowhere near Belgium or Netherlands.
Now... Back to work 😅

I can't do that we have a big government inspection


[28-Feb-25 02:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but it is a long weekend so do i just go to germany for 3 days?


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
3 days would be rough between flights and everything


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
unless you mean travel time + 3 days inbetween


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[28-Feb-25 02:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
red eye there


[28-Feb-25 02:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
maybe red eye back


[28-Feb-25 02:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
are you maybe able to take a day or two to make the trip longer? or is it an all hands on deck sort of thing


[28-Feb-25 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
can't you take 3 unpaid days ? (worst case scenario)


[28-Feb-25 02:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[28-Feb-25 02:56 PM] laaxus#0000

yeah usually i can


[28-Feb-25 02:57 PM] laaxus#0000

[03-Mar-25 12:05 PM] jcheung#0000
between snoozes and dismissing it i can guarentee that i add about an hour before i actually think about getting out of bed, then a few more minutes before i actually get out


[03-Mar-25 12:10 PM] thinkrhino#0000
I can't do that. The first note of my alarm and I'm awake. Trying to roll over and go back to sleep is just an exercise in futility for me. Laying there with morning breath and a full bladder is just torture anyway.

I used to need like 5 alarms to wake up in the morning, but actually sleeping enough most nights helps with that

[05-Mar-25 07:20 AM] keremcozin#0000
good morning


[05-Mar-25 11:29 AM] jvaler#0000
i got a haircut for the first time in like 2.5yrs


[05-Mar-25 11:29 AM] jvaler#0000
was kinda scary but i think it was good


[05-Mar-25 11:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Hair cuts are good


[05-Mar-25 11:30 AM] jvaler#0000
kept the length but she showed me a new product for my curls i think i'm gonna use


[05-Mar-25 11:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Slay!


[05-Mar-25 11:30 AM] jvaler#0000
lel


[05-Mar-25 11:30 AM] jab.sh#0000
I cut mine once a year and it's about time, maybe next week


[05-Mar-25 11:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I cut mine every 6 weeks


[05-Mar-25 11:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Got it done yesterday


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000
how does ur hair grow that fast


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000
no fair


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho I love it when when I get a new product


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] laaxus#0000
you guys got hair ?


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I am a man who keeps his hair short


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So it doesn’t grow fast


[05-Mar-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It just appears that way


[05-Mar-25 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm keeping my hair middle length because I can see already the fate awaiting me


[05-Mar-25 11:34 AM] jvaler#0000
but you're cutting your hair every 6 weeks


[05-Mar-25 11:34 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It grows maybe an inch or so


[05-Mar-25 11:34 AM] moke.#0000
I've been shaving bald the last few years and have to every couple days. But I think I'm gunna grow it to donate again


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] jvaler#0000
ohh


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] jvaler#0000
wait that's still fast


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] jab.sh#0000
I heard that you can't donate hair anymore


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] jab.sh#0000
I've never tried to donate it though


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd kms if i lost my hair

[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
I feel like an inch (in 6 weeks) is hella fast


[05-Mar-25 11:35 AM] moke.#0000
First I'm hearing that, but its been a while since I have


[05-Mar-25 11:36 AM] moke.#0000
Guess I will find out in two years when it hits the minimum


[05-Mar-25 11:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I said maybe an inch


[05-Mar-25 11:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve wanted to shave my head sometimes because my hair is annoying but my head is a weird shape 😅


[05-Mar-25 11:37 AM] moke.#0000
Same, but I just accepted it for the convenience of not having to deal with hair


[05-Mar-25 11:38 AM] jab.sh#0000
my annual haircut is a complete shave


[05-Mar-25 11:39 AM] jab.sh#0000
so I get to experience all the hair stages every year 😂


[05-Mar-25 11:40 AM] moke.#0000
Im at the awkward stage right now where its too long to be considered short and gets annoying, but too short to do anything about it


[05-Mar-25 11:40 AM] moke.#0000
I do not like it


[05-Mar-25 11:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
I could never survive a year without a haircut - I go every 4 weeks and I’d go more often if it wasn’t expensive


[05-Mar-25 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
realistically i should do that. i should actually probably be on 3 or 4 week.... i'm just too lazy


[05-Mar-25 11:48 AM] jab.sh#0000
I cut it myself 😄


[05-Mar-25 11:48 AM] jab.sh#0000
which is why i just shave it lol


[05-Mar-25 11:50 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think I grew about 3/4 of an inch


[05-Mar-25 11:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s not too bad for six weeks actually


[05-Mar-25 11:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
About 2 cm for those who don’t do imperial


[05-Mar-25 11:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
@jvaler what did your hair lady give you for your curls?


[05-Mar-25 04:20 PM] jvaler#0000
it's like this green bottle of curl cream, i think the company was avena


[05-Mar-25 04:20 PM] jvaler#0000
i forgot to look at it lol


[05-Mar-25 04:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh shit thats what got!


[05-Mar-25 04:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000

The navy really, _really_ wanted me to be a nukee back when I graduated, but man...ain't no way I was gonna be a bubblehead. Plus when I was fresh out of high school signing away several years for anything at all was a hard ask.


[15-Mar-25 04:18 PM] potaterror#0000
I did know in passing a couple twins that both signed up though. One ended up working on a CV, the other ended up on a sub.

Barotrauma is a great game with friends


[15-Mar-25 05:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
We had a campaign going for a few months that was tons of fun - it helps to just do a regular session every week or something like that


[15-Mar-25 05:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Using the in-game vc also helps. Nothing like suddenly losing contact with your sub when you’re overboard in a diving suit 😄


[15-Mar-25 05:54 PM] laaxus#0000
totally unrelated, but with the release of CIV VII, CIV VI anthology (aka civ 6 with every dlc) is available for 12€ which is CRAZY


[15-Mar-25 05:54 PM] laaxus#0000
imagine buying buggy, empty game for 55€, with no dlc and that will be complete and fixed in 5 years or so


[15-Mar-25 05:55 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't believe people still buy games at release

Helldivers 2 was my only exception because I played a lot of the first one


[15-Mar-25 06:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I feel like most games these days are unpolished and unoptomized slop


[15-Mar-25 06:07 PM] laaxus#0000
hence why you  should buy them a few years later, optimised, polished, debugged, complete and at a discount 😄


[15-Mar-25 06:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
to that point the last CIV game I bought was Civ V

I don't like using ML for coding. Most of my time is not spent typing so it doesn't help speed it up there. I don't trust it to think on anything serious because it creates the most nefarious type of bugged code. The one that looks right but isn't after painful amount of debugging. And if it's something for fun then I don't want it to be having fun on my behalf.


[17-Mar-25 12:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And from anecdotal experience with other CS majors where I go, there is a positive correlation between amount of publicly using ML to code and being an annoying CS tech bro. I would rather not be associated.


[17-Mar-25 02:56 PM] razenpok#0000
I think AI is good for writing code that I can write myself, like "write a binary search over these values"


[17-Mar-25 02:57 PM] razenpok#0000
I know how to write it myself, so I can easily validate the output


[17-Mar-25 08:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
That goes back to it just typing it in faster than you could. I don't see that minor improvement as worth it


[17-Mar-25 08:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I also don't trust the company to keep it free or cheap. It's the classic venture capital move of providing something at cost and then raising the price once people are locked in

[18-Mar-25 12:52 AM] jab.sh#0000
this is almost certainly going to happen, but I do hope the older "obsolete" models continue to be cheap/free/released for free.

[18-Mar-25 03:47 AM] razenpok#0000
If you give me notepad to code, my typing speed will plummet down to that of my grandma's


[18-Mar-25 04:02 AM] razenpok#0000
Btw, "just typing it in faster than you could. I don't see that minor improvement as worth it". I see it as worth it because it saves you your braincells to think about high level instead of churning through low-level


[18-Mar-25 04:17 AM] evov#0000
^ provided the confidence level is high that you're not then also needing to check the output it provides.


[18-Mar-25 04:29 AM] razenpok#0000
I still verify whatever AI spits out, but it's less effort than writing it myself


[18-Mar-25 12:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe now it's worth it, given you assume using the ML model has no personal or societal cost long-term.  Will it still be worth it when investors seek to get back the hundreds of billions of dollars put in, with profit? Maybe you will be the one to not become reliant on their product and jump the ship just before it sinks. Statistically speaking, most wont. Or else they would not be providing it at cost now.


[18-Mar-25 12:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
LSP's are open source and take no effort to run yourself. They aren't going anywhere no matter how bad a business would want to monetize it

I am not entirely certain about this example, there could be a lot of justifications, but OpenAI is losing money on their 200$/month subscription. And losing money as a company as a whole

Yep - you’re not interested in making money off the company, just off the stock price of the company. Don’t worry, it’s definitely sustainable

credit where its due openai releases a lot of things pretty publically i remember using openai gym quite a bit in like 2019 for some projects  and the fact that they just release it publically i think gives a wide berth
the other thing is most people are uploading their models to huggingface - even including shit like deepseek which is arguably (in my experience) a much better model than openai's

i'd like to see LLM's in the CI/CD pipeline more for same reason i have started pulling batfish into the pipeline


[19-Mar-25 12:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't think they do that anymore since about 2020. GPT-3 or 4 are not open. Except Whisper. Presumably they weighed the reputation and the money and decided it's better for PR


[19-Mar-25 12:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
2020 is also when they started getting more funding. Perhaps the beginning of the venture capital lock in


[19-Mar-25 12:31 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
No matter the convoluted fake non-profit bs they are a business. The goal of a business is to make money. Anything good that happens between now and money is an accident. Unintended side effect.


[19-Mar-25 12:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also I am not sure whose case hugging face helps but I would like to learn more about what you meant


[19-Mar-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
2020 is when they partnered with microsoft so i'm sure part of that agreement was closing gpt3


[19-Mar-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
because yeah pre 3.0 they released it publically


[19-Mar-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
and they still maintain things like gym (forked, but i digress)


[19-Mar-25 12:39 PM] evany.#0000
i'm not saying they are philanthropists at heart, but if your aware they literally spent millions over a decade working on things like alphago alphastar and alphadota which i always though was really cool tech demos just to show what reinforcement models are capable of. probably most of us are familiar with TAS which was really interesting and sometimes insane solutions to problems but they definitely came from nerd-first origins, someone has to pick up the tab so i'm not surprised they will try to build revenue from the platform


[19-Mar-25 12:46 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
That's fine. They made cool stuff and now they are trying to get their money back, I agree


[19-Mar-25 12:46 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
This isn't against my original point


[19-Mar-25 12:52 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
That I dislike using "AI" for coding because I weighed the benefit of it being able to type some stuff faster than me against:
- Potential confusing bugs
- energy cost (in the context of climate change)
- near certainty that access will be restricted in the future once people feel reliant on it (something that sets it apart from other programming tools)
- societal cost from the AI industry behaving the way it does now (see recent sourcehut blog post etc)
- potential loss of creativity (I can post the papers if interested. The experiments were on drawing and writing so not entirely certain effect on coding)


[19-Mar-25 12:53 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If you disagree with the cons or think they don't matter as much as the pros, that's fine


[19-Mar-25 12:55 PM] evany.#0000
oh i'm not arguing your original point at all because i think your right


[19-Mar-25 12:56 PM] evany.#0000
its just the tech hipster thing that makes me chuckle! before all these bootcamps and shit lol "i coded before it was cool"

[19-Mar-25 12:57 PM] evany.#0000
access is al ready restricted when it comes to openai models so your point there can't even be argued


[19-Mar-25 12:58 PM] evany.#0000
the reason i brought up hugging face is i have a spare box (that i haven't turned on since i moved due to power-consumption, 65cents a kwh sucks) that i usually run models on locally and i have an api i can bounce stuff off of for free


[19-Mar-25 12:58 PM] evany.#0000
well. "free"


[19-Mar-25 12:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think the energy cost can be solved for AI


[19-Mar-25 12:58 PM] evany.#0000
at the same time i'm not worried about privacy issues since its offline (which you did skip) i don't trust anything a model like chatgpt to stay private

one thing you mentioned dvorak was creativity and i think the opposite of that is also in trouble too


[19-Mar-25 01:07 PM] evany.#0000
i've seen more than a few times where people just don't do any work and when you point out issues with the question - "just have chatgpt do something up then"


[19-Mar-25 01:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and they are seeing that wind and solar arent cutting it and that there isnt enough energy on the grid during peak times anyways so from a profit stand point nuclear seems like a good way to go


[19-Mar-25 01:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and many venture capital nuclear startups have microsoft and co backers as well


[19-Mar-25 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
people understand that its word salad and its not worth the paper its written on, yet its relied on anyway
and the other thing is - i found myself asking it potentially a dumb question, i have large instructions (config files) sometimes that can be a few thousand lines and i was strugglging to decide what the best way to store it was


[19-Mar-25 01:08 PM] evany.#0000
and it turns around and gives nonsense and tells you your doing great by storing it in data objects in mysql


[19-Mar-25 01:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
You know all those sci-fi stories where the bad guys are the people who didn’t recognize the robots / synths / whatever artificial life as truly sentient? Maybe they’re not so bad after all 😄

its just creatively bankrupt form both angles !


[19-Mar-25 01:15 PM] sidepipe#0000

[19-Mar-25 01:29 PM] evany.#0000
well and if your even remotely intelligent (or just old) you never worry about your switching layer getting 'hacked' because its offline and has no internet connectivity
of course when i asked hows that supposed to work in a proper environment when the switch can't reach the internet "oh well... thats not really the intended scenario"


[19-Mar-25 01:31 PM] evany.#0000
because my customers will be really happy that i'm sending duplicates of their frames to feed some random switches vendor ai model so they can build heuristics off potentially sensitive data. real smart.

actually it was not backwards. Those reactors in germany where outdated and would have needed a costly overhaul to make them work again

any news on getting nuclear back in germany?


[19-Mar-25 02:46 PM] realharvey#0000
Politics in Germany actually tried to make nuclear power happen again. And everyone from the german energy companies told them: Hey dudes. Actually that makes no sense in germany


[19-Mar-25 02:47 PM] realharvey#0000
nuclear power in Europe is not cost effective and it takes about 10-15 years to plan and build a new nuclear power plant


[19-Mar-25 02:48 PM] realharvey#0000
nuclear waste storage in germany is also super expensive

Oh don’t get me wrong I think the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Committee) is a bit stifling to build new reactors here in the US. I think for any large civil project, at least for the ones I’ve seen here in the US there is overspending on BS and then skimping out on the things that matter

That's the high speed one, closer to a 2000 lb bomb


[19-Mar-25 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
It's two projectiles massing 4200 lbs each traveling at 600mph

if memory serves 5miles is class C airspace which speed limits are around 200mph

They use 95-185 mph for large close

Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Tennessee in the US, the second reactor started construction in 1973 and finished in 2016


[19-Mar-25 04:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
On October 19, 2016 the Watts Bar 2 was the first United States reactor to enter commercial operation since 1996. Due to failures in its condenser, TVA took it offline on March 23, 2017. The condenser, which was installed during the original construction phase of the plant in the 1970s, suffered a structural failure in one of its sections. On August 1, 2017, the unit was restarted after four months of repairs to the condenser.

is that really it? i was under the impression that solar/wind is just much more cost effective today and also much faster to get going


[19-Mar-25 04:37 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes, but primarily because public fear and sentiment adds so much red tape that construction delays are massively expensive


[19-Mar-25 04:39 PM] jcheung#0000
If nuclear had the same level of subsidies and acceptance as solar and wind, it would be probably a couple generations ahead of what we have now, and perhaps there would be some design standardization


[19-Mar-25 04:39 PM] jcheung#0000
Every current nuclear reactor is basically unique, and so the cost of the actual design isn't shared


[19-Mar-25 04:40 PM] jcheung#0000
The skills to construct them are not common


[19-Mar-25 04:41 PM] jcheung#0000
And i already touched on the delays, but every time that someone goes to a court and construction needs to pause, it costs thousands of dollars per day, probably tens of thousands to be realistic


[19-Mar-25 04:41 PM] jvaler#0000

as someone that is redoing their solar, solar is great and it sucks


[19-Mar-25 04:44 PM] jcheung#0000
Redoing? What happened?


[19-Mar-25 04:45 PM] evany.#0000
the issue is battery/storage issues 

wind is much higher maintenance than people play it off as, along with non-reliable numbers, (same as solar)


[19-Mar-25 04:45 PM] evany.#0000
hospitals don't like it when you cut power to them because your wind gen isn't putting out good numbers that day


[19-Mar-25 04:45 PM] evany.#0000
natural gas, coal, biofuels and nuclear are only real options for serious generation until batteries come way down


[19-Mar-25 04:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Actually it's kinda worse than that


[19-Mar-25 04:46 PM] evany.#0000
just insufficient for my usage

{Reactions}
👍 

[19-Mar-25 04:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Nuclear is great for base load power, but until power storage improves only nat gas, coal and maybe biofuel can handle the role of peaker plants


[19-Mar-25 04:48 PM] jcheung#0000
On top of that, solar and win have no inertia, which grids need to keep stable


[19-Mar-25 04:49 PM] jcheung#0000
Nor do batteries for that matter


[19-Mar-25 04:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
That should be an easy enough problem to solve tho


[19-Mar-25 04:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just add inertia


[19-Mar-25 04:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
Every turbine is basically a massive flywheel anyway


[19-Mar-25 04:50 PM] jcheung#0000
That's the point I'm trying to make, no turbines


[19-Mar-25 04:53 PM] evany.#0000
have deployed a good chunk of wind and solar to keep base stations online so peoples cell phones work in the middle of the sticks because utility company comes back with a 8 figure quote to build power to a PoP and the wind is just notoriously unreliable at small scale

[19-Mar-25 04:54 PM] potaterror#0000
TBQH that's more of a geopolitical issue than an engineering one. Containment structures in the US are pretty well designed against realistic threats that aren't straight-up organized military action. IIRC they specifically modeled for things like some bozo plowing a 747 into them.


[19-Mar-25 04:54 PM] evany.#0000
it works fine if you get one of those 400ft beasts thats good for 2MW in a windy area - but thats not something an individual will drop


[19-Mar-25 04:54 PM] jcheung#0000
Funny you would say that


[19-Mar-25 04:55 PM] potaterror#0000
Oh, yeah, I guess someone pointed that out later on.


[19-Mar-25 04:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Something something great minds?


[19-Mar-25 04:55 PM] potaterror#0000
S'pose so.


[19-Mar-25 04:56 PM] jcheung#0000
Let me dream at least


[19-Mar-25 04:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but building a flywheel to provide short term energy stability isn’t exactly an unsolvable problem. It even comes with a built-in business model - buy power when it’s cheap and sell it back when it’s expensive


[19-Mar-25 04:57 PM] potaterror#0000
But yeah, "How do you design for someone dropping a bunker buster on a NPP" is really kind of a "you don't" situation, that's the sort of thing that merits the entire world getting pissed off at whatever nation does it. The fact that Russia hasn't been taken to task for their actions around UA NPPs is pretty damning.


[19-Mar-25 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
originally when i was looking at property i wanted something with riparian rights so i could build a little hydroelectric dam


[19-Mar-25 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
at least in theory that would give me mostly stable electric


[19-Mar-25 04:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes, except flywheel systems are incredibly expensive to build, when you have to contain tons of metal spinning at mach jesus and being affected by earth's rotation


[19-Mar-25 04:58 PM] potaterror#0000
Ditto. Wasn't in the cards, though.


[19-Mar-25 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
same. couldn't find anything suitable


[19-Mar-25 04:59 PM] potaterror#0000
Pumped storage is a pretty neat compromise to storage, but the problem there is suitable terrain.

[19-Mar-25 04:59 PM] jcheung#0000
That said i'm not saying flywheels shouldn't be built


[19-Mar-25 05:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
But they don’t need to be spinning that fast for short term storage - it’s not like the turbines that do that right now need to


[19-Mar-25 05:04 PM] jcheung#0000
So that depends on the flywheel mass


[19-Mar-25 05:04 PM] jcheung#0000
Lighter ones can go 60k rmp


[19-Mar-25 05:04 PM] jcheung#0000
I think there's one over 500 tons that only does a couple hundred


[19-Mar-25 05:05 PM] jcheung#0000
500 tons spinning at 200 rpm is still fast as hell


[19-Mar-25 05:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but for the inertia problem you mentioned, all you need is something equivalent to a turbine that we can keep spinning to provide inertia


[19-Mar-25 05:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I definitely agree that long term energy storage in a flywheel is hard and expensive


[19-Mar-25 05:10 PM] jcheung#0000
Tbh flywheel power storage is measured in minutes


[19-Mar-25 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Maybe an hour at best


[19-Mar-25 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
They're like.... an inductor


[19-Mar-25 05:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah by short term here I mean seconds 😄


[19-Mar-25 05:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh, you meant actually short term 😂


[19-Mar-25 05:14 PM] jcheung#0000
So there actually is a difference in the systems we were talking about


[19-Mar-25 05:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
Don’t get me wrong, I’d love a future where we did our long-term storage in flywheels too (because I think they’re neat) but that’s probably not happening 😄


[19-Mar-25 05:15 PM] jcheung#0000
Measuring in seconds would not be power storage, as it doesn't store and generate electricity
Those are... called... something condensers


[19-Mar-25 05:15 PM] jcheung#0000
Hang on kemme look it up


[19-Mar-25 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Synchronous condensors


[19-Mar-25 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
On the other hand there are actually flywheels that can be used for actual power storage


[19-Mar-25 05:17 PM] jcheung#0000
But those leak energy like a sieve and don't last long when a large load is put on them


[19-Mar-25 05:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that sounds familiar. Basically my point was that you can replace the inertia that turbines provide with an equivalent amount of spinning metal that’s just not connected to a boiler of some sort 😄


[19-Mar-25 05:17 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. It's not cheap though, and provides mo tangible benefits for the stockholders 🙄

The real question is, why was it uninstalled? Going to have to talk to your local democracy officer


[24-Mar-25 12:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I saw there was a new warbond - guess I’d better get playing again


[24-Mar-25 12:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve been having a lot of fun with the portable hellbomb 😄


[24-Mar-25 12:48 PM] jcheung#0000
It's become part of my standard loadout vs bot


[24-Mar-25 12:49 PM] jcheung#0000
Strategem jammers are easy... at least so long as i don't get one shot by stuff 3 times in a row


[24-Mar-25 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
And even if i miss the jammer, killing off 20-50 enemies in one go is super helpful for mopping up


[24-Mar-25 12:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not to mention friends accidentally setting it off when they try to stim you - that’s been great 😂


[24-Mar-25 01:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc it’s a new hard drive the old one failed


[24-Mar-25 01:05 PM] jcheung#0000
I triggered one on a rando because he was out of stims and i had a supply pack


[24-Mar-25 01:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can only install so many games in a month too bc of internet limits


[24-Mar-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
Apparently i missed that another guy had triggered the hellbomb 3 times in missions before i joined, so he chased him down and killed them both


[24-Mar-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
Ewww


[24-Mar-25 01:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Time to take a laptop to a public wifi spot to download games and then go home and use steam cache stuff


[24-Mar-25 01:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Like, idk, a library or something


[24-Mar-25 01:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Get yourself a nice book to read and check in on the download in 5 hours


[24-Mar-25 01:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can download like 10 100 GB games a month and that happened last month so


[24-Mar-25 01:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s not so much a speed thing


[24-Mar-25 01:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho the new “month” ticked over yesterday so I am redownloading them


[24-Mar-25 01:09 PM] jcheung#0000
I know, i was thinking to get around data caps


[24-Mar-25 01:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
🤷‍♂️


[24-Mar-25 01:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But my hard drives are almost full again anyways so


[24-Mar-25 01:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[24-Mar-25 01:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I need to study for a test


[24-Mar-25 01:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Moar means bigger drive and idk that I want to


[24-Mar-25 01:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Why bigger


[24-Mar-25 01:16 PM] jcheung#0000
I just go for quantity


[24-Mar-25 01:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[24-Mar-25 01:17 PM] jcheung#0000
Or some micro ATX board?


[24-Mar-25 01:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
I had a hard drive taped to the side of my case in my old PC


[24-Mar-25 01:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have to buy new power supply


[24-Mar-25 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For the other drives


[24-Mar-25 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Cause like the power cord


[24-Mar-25 01:19 PM] jcheung#0000
How many drives do you have


[24-Mar-25 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
2 NVME ones and a normal sata ssd


[24-Mar-25 01:19 PM] jcheung#0000
You can get a splitter and safely run... at least 4 drives, I'm pretty sure


[24-Mar-25 01:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok like I have enough cords to power extra ones


[24-Mar-25 01:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But not enough juice


[24-Mar-25 01:20 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh


[24-Mar-25 01:20 PM] jcheung#0000
You're running that tight on juice? Damn


[24-Mar-25 01:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I got a beefy gpu but not so beefy psu


[24-Mar-25 01:21 PM] jcheung#0000
Pretty sure my graphics draws enough at idle to power a dozen sata ssds 😓


[24-Mar-25 01:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah hundreds even


[24-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Well


[24-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Idk about hundreds


[24-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Faintly recall them being around 3-5 watts of draw under load


[24-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
So that would be... 500 watts for a hundred, theoretically


[24-Mar-25 01:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Granted not all would be running at full bore at once


[24-Mar-25 01:24 PM] jcheung#0000
So maybe call it 150 watts


[24-Mar-25 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean


[24-Mar-25 01:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair I think mine spikes to 600W?


[24-Mar-25 01:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I wonder what it idles at 🙈


[24-Mar-25 01:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Get a kill a watt 😜

{Reactions}
💯 

[24-Mar-25 01:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Record while idling, then turn off, uninstall graphics, turn on


[24-Mar-25 01:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Difference would theoretically be graphics draw


[24-Mar-25 01:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
🤷‍♂️


[24-Mar-25 01:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m sure there is some program


[25-Mar-25 03:21 PM] jab.sh#0000
kill a watt's are nice


[25-Mar-25 03:26 PM] jcheung#0000

[25-Mar-25 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
I got onto one that lasted a month


[25-Mar-25 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
Was selected as an alternate so my voice didn't even matter


[25-Mar-25 03:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Which sucked because half of them got all weepy and teary eyed at the sob story you're told to not use for consideration instead of looking at the facts


[25-Mar-25 03:29 PM] moke.#0000
Jury duty is the worst


[25-Mar-25 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
And of the other half that weren't crying, one didn't care and 3 of us were alternates!


[25-Mar-25 03:30 PM] moke.#0000
I got stuck in deliberations for two and a half days over an open and shut trespassing case because one juror didnt think it was fair™️


[25-Mar-25 03:31 PM] moke.#0000
The dude went to a casino he had been banned from, won money, and got caught while cashing out. They still paid him but trespassed him. He claimed he got a mailer so it must have been ok to come back.

[25-Mar-25 03:33 PM] moke.#0000

[25-Mar-25 03:33 PM] jcheung#0000
Mine was asbestos case. Man smoked 2 packs a day for 30 years, claimed to have done *insert absurdly high number* of jobs related to asbestos which came out to 3ish multi-day jobs a day for 10 years straight.... and claimed that his lung cancer (that had none of the traits for asbestos) was caused entirely by the asbestos product company.
Jury awarded stupid amounts of damages because, and i quote, "we thought the first number included punitive damages"

We didn't get to stick around for sentencing, but the one person *finally* relented.


[25-Mar-25 03:36 PM] moke.#0000
One of the jurors (the foreman no less) did a big no no and decided to just by happenstance see the car the defendant drove, and then brought it up and thought "this dude is rich, he shouldnt be let go" was a smart decision

"What if his car was totaled and that was their insurance loaner"


[25-Mar-25 03:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Do you think a Fellowship from the NRC makes me a salaried employee of the US government?


[25-Mar-25 03:40 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I was selected for a federal grand jury a few years ago.  One day a week for a year and a half.

It was interesting, but the entire setup is very much designed so that you indict (things like you need 16 people but can have as many as... 23?, and 12  yes votes is a vote to indict regardless of how many are there, there's only a prosecuter [e.g. no defendent/target, and no lawyer for the witness] -- who is also your lawyer -- and they aren't requried to tell you exculpatory evidence, in fact, they can tell you that you can't ask a particular question, etc).

A grand jury will _definately_ indict ham sandwiches, especially just before lunch break.


[25-Mar-25 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000
Do you get a paycheck from the govt?


[25-Mar-25 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000

when they did the mobile redesign you could opt in/opt out, wonder if that's possible on desktop

I didn't see any settings in the menu, and no questions on startup


[25-Mar-25 06:00 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah it was a bit obscure, you had to long press on the context window of the ✨ emoji to opt in, and then I think there was a setting to opt out


[25-Mar-25 06:08 PM] sidepipe#0000

What is the difference port forwarding and nginx proxy manager?

:eavSalute:


[27-Mar-25 04:58 AM] manhim#0000
Very high level:

Port forwarding happens at the firewall and is usually used to expose ports publicly.

nginx is used to proxy anything, in or out of your network. But it's not part of the firewall, so you can't expose things publicly without forwarding ports regardless.

They're very different things at different network levels.


[27-Mar-25 09:44 AM] jab.sh#0000
nginx reverse proxy lets you forward just two ports (80 and 443) and have however many sites behind it as you want, assuming they all speak http


[27-Mar-25 10:06 AM] manhim#0000
You can bind any ports and proxy any TCP or UDP connections with nginx.


[27-Mar-25 10:07 AM] manhim#0000
But it's built with HTTP and HTTPS in mind


[27-Mar-25 10:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you’re self-hosting stuff and wanna do a reverse proxy, traefik is very useful


[27-Mar-25 10:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
I was able to set up reverse proxy + wildcard certs with it so everything I self-host goes through https 🙂


[27-Mar-25 10:29 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, I heard good stuff about traefik


[27-Mar-25 10:32 AM] evany.#0000
fundamentally they are the same but port forwarding would be for say your hsoting your own factorio server or something, nginx isn't going to do that. likewise you could expose a webserver via a port forward but your more likely to use something like nginx as it has a bunch of other benefits including say having 3 webservers so you can take 1 down for maintenance and your users dont cry about it for example


[27-Mar-25 10:37 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Hmm thanks guys


[27-Mar-25 10:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Doesn’t it also enable you to use SSL certs for the things you host


[27-Mar-25 10:39 AM] manhim#0000
A port forward is "dumb" since it doesn't know the traffic going through it, so it can't.

nginx is probably what you'd need for that.

Caddy is probably the easy route if you want SSL / LetsEncrypt these days


[27-Mar-25 10:41 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I think I need SSL for vaultwarden


[27-Mar-25 10:41 AM] manhim#0000
Cloudflared is cool too since it also hides your internal IP


[27-Mar-25 10:42 AM] .shiva.#0000
Caddy manages the whole LetsEncrypt ACME stuff for you, would recommend over learning nginx if you're starting fresh and don't have prior experience with it


[27-Mar-25 10:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok

caddy ios probably a lot easier to set up than traefik for SSL certs


[27-Mar-25 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
i vaguely remember it being a whole thing when I did it for traefik


[27-Mar-25 10:46 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Mar-25 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000

for wildcard certs I think so

Unless you want to just VPN all the time, yeah probably

i picked up a domain name through cloudflare and that worked really well


[27-Mar-25 10:48 AM] .shiva.#0000
(external to your network)


[27-Mar-25 10:48 AM] .shiva.#0000
If it's *soley* for use at home


[27-Mar-25 10:48 AM] .shiva.#0000
You do not


[27-Mar-25 10:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
do you not need to own the domain name for internal use for SSL certs?


[27-Mar-25 10:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
that could have saved me 30 bucks 😄


[27-Mar-25 10:49 AM] .shiva.#0000
Well, if it's all internal to the network, self signed / just http is fine

To be transparent, I'd probably use the pro version of Bitwarden rather than host my own instance if I'd just be starting out. I wouldn't mess with something that needs a high level of security knowledge and constant maintenance.


[27-Mar-25 11:05 AM] manhim#0000
Does it integrate with home assistant?


[27-Mar-25 11:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
https://docs.mealie.io/documentation/community-guide/home-assistant/


[27-Mar-25 11:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
apparently so (because it has an API), but I haven't used it


[27-Mar-25 11:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
No that’s a totally valid take and opinion


[27-Mar-25 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I just figured I would give it a go and if it’s too much to handle I read that it’s super easy to switch over to bitwarden


[27-Mar-25 11:12 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, Vaultwarden is a custom server for Bitwarden. They're part of the same environment.


[27-Mar-25 11:13 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah they use the bitwarden api and are written in R or something? Made it less resource intensive


[27-Mar-25 11:14 AM] manhim#0000
Oh, nice. I'll give it a look once I restart toying with HA


[27-Mar-25 11:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
Is home assistant useful for someone who doesn't have any smart home stuff (but lots of self-hosted services)?


[27-Mar-25 11:15 AM] manhim#0000
It's in Rust but yeah, it's based on the official server's API


[27-Mar-25 11:16 AM] manhim#0000
It can be. You can setup custom sensors to check for things like server usage or temperature


[27-Mar-25 11:16 AM] manhim#0000
Then create custom dashboards that display all your servers status


[27-Mar-25 11:16 AM] .urpalhal#0000
lol R 😂 that’s a statistics code I’ve used


[27-Mar-25 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000

[27-Mar-25 11:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Mar-25 11:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
This is cool


[27-Mar-25 11:18 AM] manhim#0000
With HA I can also create a dashboard with my security cameras, a log of events, etc.


[27-Mar-25 11:19 AM] manhim#0000
I deleted my instance cause I didn't want to maintain this many custom stuff anymore, but I'm slowly changing all my outlets for intelligent ones, so I'm going to give it another go when I'll find some time 😅

the nice thing about getting a static ip is you just point it at cloudflare and they can handle ssl for you


[27-Mar-25 12:16 PM] evany.#0000
"make it someone elses problem"


[27-Mar-25 12:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so like I read that cloudflare makes you use their DNS, but like I have a pihole doing DNS so how would that work?


[27-Mar-25 12:17 PM] evany.#0000
different use of dns


[27-Mar-25 12:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
how so


[27-Mar-25 12:18 PM] evany.#0000
so one is asking for soa or to hold a ns record - which is why you point a domain's ns records to cloudflare to make them state of authority i.e they get to tell root dns servers whats going on with your domain name (home.halshouse.com)


[27-Mar-25 12:19 PM] evany.#0000
the other is pihole doing recursive lookups against an existing dns server going 'hey wheres home.halshouse.com?'


[27-Mar-25 12:19 PM] evany.#0000
both can be true simultaneously


[27-Mar-25 12:19 PM] evany.#0000
(and are, normally)


[27-Mar-25 12:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
is bad.stealyourshit.com a good place? as well  kinda thing for pihole as well if you set up blocked sites


[27-Mar-25 12:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
?


[27-Mar-25 12:21 PM] evany.#0000
not super fmailiar with pihole, but from what i understand it works off of blacklists 
i.e random contirbutor to pihole says homedepotmarketing.com is bad and they put it on a list, assuming it goes through an approval then your pihole updates daily/weekly/whatever - and now pihole stops fulfilling requests for homedepotmarketing.com


[27-Mar-25 12:21 PM] evany.#0000
typically this just results in your browser not rendering anything as the lookup failed - and thus the ad "dissappears"


[27-Mar-25 12:21 PM] evany.#0000
ideally the rest of the content still loads


[27-Mar-25 12:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000

the lists are independent of pihole, and a lot of them probably have no approval process. pihole by default updates lists once a week (I think on Sunday) but yeah you got the gist 🙂

How does it feel to know that everyone knows that you’ve played said “certain mod”?

[27-Mar-25 07:38 PM] jvaler#0000

i saw this artist's posts about making new planet textures but didn't realize they'd finish so soon that the mod is already out

One of these days I aspire to getting into the home assistant game.


[29-Mar-25 02:09 AM] potaterror#0000
I should probably focus on having walls that don't have exposed insulation first, though.


[29-Mar-25 03:27 AM] inspirity#0000
i got free, gifted license


[29-Mar-25 10:17 AM] jab.sh#0000
ah


[30-Mar-25 04:02 PM] evany.#0000
that can be a pro for easy running of new wires and testing for at least awhile. nothing worse than installing something and then figuring out three weeks later it broke. 

i'm keen o n leaving stuff open for a few weeks personally

HA is a wild ride

What would you want to do with it?


[30-Mar-25 04:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
As someone who has a server and is looking for things to do with it - what can you do with it? 😄


[30-Mar-25 04:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve got a couple apps that have pretty good APIs that I would love to add some automation to


[30-Mar-25 04:10 PM] evany.#0000
a lot.
control your tv, lighting, my power, alert you if your garage door is open
auto lock doors if your prone to elaving them open
i've done  stair lighting if my or my wifes phone goes near it (i want to move this to a motion sensor, just haven't setup the motion sensor yet)


[30-Mar-25 04:11 PM] evany.#0000
i'm tinkering with lights in certain rooms that will be normal lights during the day but dimmer lights in the evening (think bathrooms, to preserve night vision and not make you want to kill yourself blinded by white light)


[30-Mar-25 04:15 PM] evany.#0000
and its worth noting i'm a total noob with it. only recently set it up a few months ago
but i have some really cool energy monitoring happening

you can see when i played a game on march 22nd (my gpu kicked on? lol that was probably me and hal!)

[30-Mar-25 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s cool af


[30-Mar-25 04:19 PM] evany.#0000
i wired my central ac too


[30-Mar-25 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t have a ton of smart home stuff atm, but that’s partly because I rent and partly because I don’t like things phoning home if I can avoid it

Maybe I’ll have to look into some stuff once we move into the new apartment 😄


[30-Mar-25 04:22 PM] evany.#0000
i plan to do my fridges and freezers, would be nice if i could find one for my washer & dryer too so i can tell when they are "done" and maybe give my wife or i's phone a "ding mother fucker" if one of us is home


[30-Mar-25 04:22 PM] evany.#0000
but thats just cuz i'm 60+ cents per kwh so i've become painfully aware of power usage

{Reactions}
😭 

[30-Mar-25 04:22 PM] evany.#0000
i plan to embed ceiling fans too.


[30-Mar-25 04:23 PM] potaterror#0000
It'd be nice to have power/water monitoring, climate control, lighting, etc. tied in. Just no time to fiddle with any of it ATM, especially since I flatly refuse anything that requires a connection to the 'net. If I can't park everything on a VLAN cut off from the outside world, it's a hard pass.


[30-Mar-25 04:23 PM] evany.#0000
so things like lights and ceiling fans don't get left on when nobodys home all day


[30-Mar-25 04:23 PM] evany.#0000
its time consuming, i''m very early on and just been slowly attacking it over last 2-3 months


[30-Mar-25 04:24 PM] evany.#0000
and i have same hangups


[30-Mar-25 04:24 PM] evany.#0000
no "cloud".


[30-Mar-25 04:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's my ideal - pick up a bunch of smart home stuff and cut it off from the outside world


[30-Mar-25 04:26 PM] potaterror#0000
The good news in my case is that most of the physical infrastructure should be easy. My house is about as simple as they come, but I'm also damn near rebuilding the thing anyhow.


[30-Mar-25 04:26 PM] evany.#0000
still trying to find a multgig poe (bt) switch that isn't a total nightmare so my vlans are pretty ugly.


[30-Mar-25 04:27 PM] potaterror#0000
Also means I don't have a ton of time to figure out what's what on the HA side of things. Oh well, problems for later.


[30-Mar-25 04:27 PM] evany.#0000
if your in the process of that i wouldn't worry too much about it and would just tell you to add extra conduits everywhere so you can make your wiring less painful later.


[30-Mar-25 04:28 PM] potaterror#0000
That's the plan anyway. That and I'm trying to figure out how to sub out plywood in place of drywall for much of it, because I hate drywall with an undying passion.


[30-Mar-25 04:29 PM] evany.#0000
for internal ?


[30-Mar-25 04:29 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah.


[30-Mar-25 04:29 PM] evany.#0000
wild man


[30-Mar-25 04:29 PM] evany.#0000
wife would crucify me


[30-Mar-25 04:30 PM] potaterror#0000
Figuring out a way to make it look decent is a bit of a thing. Still haven't firmly committed to the idea.


[30-Mar-25 04:30 PM] evany.#0000
i personally wouldn't. drywall isn't so bad


[30-Mar-25 04:30 PM] evany.#0000
easy to repair drywall, plywood/osb ... ehhh


[30-Mar-25 04:31 PM] potaterror#0000
Depends on how it is installed. At least plywood comes off in nice panels.


[30-Mar-25 04:31 PM] potaterror#0000
I won't touch OSB. Worst of both worlds.


[30-Mar-25 04:32 PM] potaterror#0000
If I wanted something that turned to crap if there's a leak, I'd just stick with drywall.


[30-Mar-25 04:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
there are so many things I want to do


[30-Mar-25 04:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but can't really bc I am broke, but also renting


[30-Mar-25 04:48 PM] evany.#0000
renting and ha are kind of incompatible in a lot of ways


[30-Mar-25 04:49 PM] evany.#0000
You can keep things simple with lighting and motion sensors and things like robo vacuums on schedules, but once you get into locks and wiring it’s like “ehhh”


[30-Mar-25 04:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Maybe someday I’ll will own a home

how do you do that


[30-Mar-25 07:15 PM] evany.#0000
the lights i currently have it operational on it was pretty straightforward


[30-Mar-25 07:16 PM] jab.sh#0000
oh you do it through your lights, not through HA?


[30-Mar-25 07:16 PM] evany.#0000
go into the entity and on the left hand side theres automations - add the automations (and scene if necessary)


[30-Mar-25 07:17 PM] evany.#0000
under triggers theres a 'when sunset' and you can configure it to change default color etc


[30-Mar-25 07:18 PM] evany.#0000
i only have it working right now on WLED enabled strips


[30-Mar-25 07:18 PM] evany.#0000

[30-Mar-25 07:19 PM] jab.sh#0000
do you have them turn on automatically then?


[30-Mar-25 07:22 PM] evany.#0000
i do if a bluetooth sensor picks up me or the wife near the stairwell atm


[30-Mar-25 07:22 PM] evany.#0000
i intend to change that to motion sensors, i just haven't run power into the stairwell yet.


[30-Mar-25 07:22 PM] evany.#0000
need to get wife and kid outta the house for a saturday and shut off power and go nuts.

Thoughts on the Switch 2? You gonna buy one or nah?


[04-Apr-25 12:25 PM] realharvey#0000
i wait for the oled version


[04-Apr-25 12:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair


[04-Apr-25 12:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
There’s a few games I want to play that will be coming out but like I haven’t really been playing my switch so


[04-Apr-25 12:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It makes it hard to justify the purchase


[04-Apr-25 12:26 PM] pagy1234#0000
it seems outrageously expensive for no apparent reason


[04-Apr-25 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The games or the console?


[04-Apr-25 12:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
the games expecially


[04-Apr-25 12:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
$80-90 for every game


[04-Apr-25 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well 90 for physical


[04-Apr-25 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But yeah nutso


[04-Apr-25 12:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
and physical copies are $90 but only act as one time use keys


[04-Apr-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Only some of them


[04-Apr-25 12:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh fr?

Like cyberpunk will be


[04-Apr-25 12:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
at least thats a bit better


[04-Apr-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think the price for the console is fine


[04-Apr-25 12:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like it’s better than a steam deck performance wise and is only slightly more expensive


[04-Apr-25 12:29 PM] realharvey#0000
the Issue I have with this is, that nintendo doesnt really do discounts. So it just stays super expensive forever

yeah thats why I hate the price increase


[04-Apr-25 12:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, unfortunatly theres no major competitor to nintendo, so they can literally do anything they want


[04-Apr-25 12:31 PM] laaxus#0000
Now that steamdeck is here, the only reason to buy a switch is for nintendo exclusive (mario, smash)


[04-Apr-25 12:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I haven’t read too much into it bc then I’ll fixate and buy one at launch, but is it confirmed that all Nintendo games will be $80 for digital?


[04-Apr-25 12:31 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm gonna hatewatch that fromsoft exclusive game and hope it sucks (i'm not mad, not at all)


[04-Apr-25 12:32 PM] pagy1234#0000
pretty sure it goes for most of the exclusives

it's the biggest license ON EARTH
it's based on GAMES
but the games are worse than ps3 games from 2008


[04-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
because they know they can produce a pile of shit with pokemon written on it, and sell 25M copies of it

I remember how Trump was talking so much about Freedom. Freedom this, Freedom that. 
I never understood.
Now, with his latest tariffs, I got it.
Trump is a Buddhist, he wants to free the Americans of their material possessions.

2 possibilities :
1) He wants high tariffs so that he can reduce income tax for the wealthiest
2) He truly wants to bring back industries at home (don't mind the fact it gonna take 10 years at best, that it would be more expensive in the end, and htat many many companies will just default in the mean time)


[04-Apr-25 12:59 PM] laaxus#0000
Currently, his tariffs incentivize industries to invest outside of america, not IN america


[04-Apr-25 12:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think he thinks that it's a win-win because of that - either people keep exporting to the US and there's a tax revenue boost, or they don't and stuff gets onshored. Or he scores some quick political wins through meaningless concessions like the previous tariff threats


[04-Apr-25 12:59 PM] laaxus#0000
because this dumb idiot does not understand that with today supply chains, items goes back and forth borders many times


[04-Apr-25 01:00 PM] laaxus#0000
do mind that 
If it's case 1) : he's blalantly lying in front of 400M americans
if it's case 2) he's showing INCREDIBLE incompetency


[04-Apr-25 01:01 PM] pagy1234#0000

[04-Apr-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
don't let you get influenced by propaganda
China is the best in solar, wind turbines, nuclear and the whole renewable sectors


[04-Apr-25 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
BYD suffers manufacturing issues, but not more than teslas


[04-Apr-25 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
China is the country doing the most against climate change in the world.
They're doing it so they can invade taiwain, but they're the one doing the most (with the uk)


[04-Apr-25 01:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The only reason America is doing anything substantial with nuclear power rn is because of china and a dick comparing contest


[04-Apr-25 01:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah lol, I think it was 87% of solar panels being produced in china?

though I'm guessing I'm technically closer to ~480, seems like my equity shot up a bit sometime this week, so something must have gone through the roof

{Reactions}

[14-Apr-25 02:27 PM] harkenn#0000
But styling via classnames is not a very good approach for large scale applications, I've found (again, in React), but yeah without the `classnames` library its especially painful.


[14-Apr-25 02:29 PM] harkenn#0000
We were already rolling with React by the time VueJS hit FE development for our flagship apps, and it was too similar to Aurellia (specifically its binding layer) to make us feel comfortable. We had to jump ship off Aurellia after some meaningful work, years ago, because it had enormous performance problems.


[14-Apr-25 02:30 PM] harkenn#0000
I wish I could see how PrUn's data layer is architected though. Unfortunate

[14-Apr-25 02:31 PM] harkenn#0000
Oh I'm sure, but given the amount of data coming in on the websocket connection and the amount of data in those messages alone, I suspect its either a mess of hacks to get it to work performantly, or its pretty well organized and optimized.

Ah, gotcha


[14-Apr-25 02:35 PM] harkenn#0000
And yeah, the current version of React dev-tools go back quite a long way (as you can see) so the notion that PrUn is using a version of react that it doesn't support is....not great.


[14-Apr-25 02:35 PM] harkenn#0000
Especially considering there are several enormous breaking changes between pre v15 and modern React.


[14-Apr-25 02:35 PM] razenpok#0000

It can, although you can go to some efforts during build to intentionally break it. It's possible that's what has been done here. Usually you can force it, and it works but you are stuck dealing with minified components, props, state, Etc


[14-Apr-25 02:54 PM] harkenn#0000
One thing that occurred to me after I stepped away from my computer, do updates to pruns interface code break the extension? Or is the interface code providing reliable IDs and consistent ways to select out specific elements that make it pretty friendly to extend?


[14-Apr-25 03:01 PM] razenpok#0000
Sometimes it breaks, but not that often. Because:
1. PrUn UI is quite stable, and molp doesn't change it often
2. In some places, he added a `data-prun-id` to elements representing game entities. He did it after I asked him to, so not every UI element has this attribute.
3. CSS classes are not minified, so we can hook to elements based on the class names

molp is usually very responsive to issues in 3rd party tools, so it's been mostly stable for the past year


[14-Apr-25 03:29 PM] harkenn#0000
That's better than I expected, and nice that they're accommodating. Is molp the solo dev of the game? Or just the main / community facing dev?


[14-Apr-25 03:31 PM] laaxus#0000
it's de facto the solo dev of this game


[14-Apr-25 03:32 PM] harkenn#0000
Was it originally not a solo venture or something? Curious about the defacto qualification


[14-Apr-25 03:38 PM] laaxus#0000
There used to be multiple devs


[14-Apr-25 07:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Molp's great. I asked him how they created the universe and he shared and explained the whole thing

“In the beginning, molp created Antares. But he saw, that it’s not good for them to be alone, so he created the other regions, too”

Once you get the 25.4.14 Refined PrUn version, try using XIT ACT
@pagy1234 @realharvey @tanda I recommend the quickstart flow there or importing actions from prunplanner.
@pxlfox. The new version should now work with any localization.
@laaxus It no longer requires you to open tiles needed in advance, so maybe you'll like it this time.

still the smoothest fuckup I've made so far 😄


[15-Apr-25 07:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
it works great, but It a bit tedious (I think at least) to do the whole process of creating material groups, buy and transfer commands for a resupply task, maybe the "quickstart" button should change to "quicksupply" or something simmilar after the first use to make it more simple to just create resupply orders?


[15-Apr-25 07:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
I would find it quite useful at least


[15-Apr-25 08:24 AM] jcheung#0000

I don't have a workflow with this tool yet, I've still got some lessons to learn on it


[15-Apr-25 09:12 PM] jcheung#0000
i specifically don't use the auto buy because simply the act of it opening the page for me means that i don't look close, which means that if moke fucks the carbon market again i won't pay attention and buy at 2k/u


[15-Apr-25 09:12 PM] jcheung#0000

I was fine with 1 ship for 7 bases for quite a while (but I wasn't responsible for any shipping of inputs or products, so that definitely helped)


[16-Apr-25 12:02 AM] jab.sh#0000
at that point (once you have the capital) you could just visit each planet once every 90 days


[16-Apr-25 12:45 AM] finestone#0000
No way my planets have enough storage for 90 days lol


[16-Apr-25 12:51 AM] realharvey#0000
I think he's talking about leased bases and bases that are part of a project cooperative where all shipping other than consumables and repair is handled by others


[16-Apr-25 12:52 AM] jcheung#0000
I have two bases i could theoretically set up for 90 day visits

You can add the CX buy action just to be able to see the shopping list in the preview of the action package

Then i mindlessly click


[16-Apr-25 02:23 AM] jcheung#0000
I specifically don't so that i have to slow down and open a buffer so i break out of click click click mode

[16-Apr-25 08:36 AM] harkenn#0000
I don't suppose there's any way in PrUn (or with RePrUn) to create a screen that actually takes an input somehow? e.g. a screen that can be used to check a material, then change the input to a different material, etc. without having to either created dedicated screens for each material or manually change every panel?


[16-Apr-25 08:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
wdym?


[16-Apr-25 08:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Not that I know of


[16-Apr-25 08:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
input is based on waht is being made


[16-Apr-25 08:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000
What are you trying to achieve? Maybe there is another way


[16-Apr-25 08:44 AM] harkenn#0000
Well I'm only just starting out, and perhaps it becomes less of an issue at larger scales (because you're stocking up on common mats, in bulk, infrequently?) but at present I find myself needing to pull up the same 3 screens for materials to place an order in, for example.


[16-Apr-25 08:45 AM] harkenn#0000
e.g. the material chart at a given exchange, the order of that same material at that same exchange, and the order book at that exchange.


[16-Apr-25 08:46 AM] harkenn#0000
(let alone perhaps the need to look at local markets for that same material, or perhaps the next closest exchange to look for significant variances in price)


[16-Apr-25 08:47 AM] harkenn#0000
I was just imaginging building out a screen with these things in mind and then somehow (perhaps a special "panel" in the top left that's just an `input`) being able to just put in `FE` and have all other panels in the screen change over based on the input I provided.


[16-Apr-25 08:48 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Cannot afaik


[16-Apr-25 08:48 AM] harkenn#0000
(all perfectly feasible to do, I would think, especially in RePrun, but now I'm thinking perhaps my use-case is somewhat contrived)


[16-Apr-25 08:48 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I like your usecase tho


[16-Apr-25 08:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Very common use case, but sadly, as you already noticed, you can either open a new buffer every time and open the commands manually or create static screens for materials you often use


[16-Apr-25 08:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could make a dynamic sheet, but those would be off-game and only informational (you obviously couldn’t place an order there)


[16-Apr-25 08:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There isn’t a way to create buffers dynamically


[16-Apr-25 08:52 AM] harkenn#0000
right right; hrm. I'll check with Razen to make sure there's nothing about it that is fundamentally infeasible about the concept. Perhaps something to get my feet wet with, in RePrUn


[16-Apr-25 08:53 AM] harkenn#0000
Perhaps there is some issue with changing the command of a buffer programmatically.


[16-Apr-25 08:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I think technically rPRUN could support such a feature, but I’m not sure if it’s allowed by the devs


[16-Apr-25 08:54 AM] harkenn#0000
Oh, is that something that has come up in the past with other stuff? Again, I'm new so I've no reference for the history of these things.


[16-Apr-25 08:55 AM] harkenn#0000
Razen was saying yesterday that Mort (I think that is his handle?) was willing to add data-ids to facilitate functionality/stability in RePrUn, so I had assumed Apex had a friendly stance on client-side enhancements, especially QoL things


[16-Apr-25 08:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
They do, as long they support the user without automating calls to the server.


[16-Apr-25 08:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Changing a buffer programmatically would technically send new requests. I’m really not sure where they draw the line, so…


[16-Apr-25 08:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
I made tons of different screens early on for those things

Ah, a good point, and yeah that's a pretty reasonable distinction for them to draw the line at.

Why not just tile `CXM FE`


[16-Apr-25 09:12 AM] jcheung#0000
I haven't used material chart since like

I always look at the chart 🥹


[16-Apr-25 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
The new xit action packages get the line really quite fuzzy


[16-Apr-25 09:14 AM] jcheung#0000
Plus pmmg/rprun has always opened buffers in the background (what, you thought buffers were supposed to start in teens/low 20s on a refresh?)

[16-Apr-25 10:19 AM] razenpok#0000
Not really? Every server request still requires a player click


[16-Apr-25 10:21 AM] jcheung#0000
i meant fuzzy in the sense of whether having tiles altered would be possible or not. could get it so that you select FE, then click and it alters other tiles


[16-Apr-25 10:23 AM] razenpok#0000
Pmmg never did that, this is an rprun behavior. I talked to molp about this, and it indeed is against the ToS. The only reason I got a get out of jail card is because they see much value in xit burn and others. Their plan for the future is to create an official API. But, until that, rprun remains a violation that devs take a blind eye on. But better not test their patience

[16-Apr-25 10:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
I mentioned this in the OOG Discord, but I think their willingness to look past things like that for rPrun shows they really do care about QoL

{Reactions}
💯 

[16-Apr-25 10:25 AM] razenpok#0000
That, yes


[16-Apr-25 10:26 AM] razenpok#0000
I think I would've probably stopped developing rprun if I got a hard no against that


[16-Apr-25 10:26 AM] razenpok#0000
Because that would be bad QoL


[16-Apr-25 10:27 AM] razenpok#0000
It was a problem with pmmg, as it required players to manually open BS buffers for every base to get workforce and production data


[16-Apr-25 10:27 AM] razenpok#0000
But, that made pmmg fully compliant


[16-Apr-25 10:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yup. My start page is still 20 BS buffers from when I was using PMMG 😄

{Reactions}
😶‍🌫️ 

[16-Apr-25 10:27 AM] razenpok#0000
That, and things sometimes got out-of-date


[16-Apr-25 10:28 AM] razenpok#0000
You would still need a separate click for each tile


[16-Apr-25 10:28 AM] razenpok#0000
Most tiles send a server request


[16-Apr-25 10:45 AM] harkenn#0000
That policy makes sense at first glance, but the more I think about it the less sense it makes. In actuality they're fine with 1 user action making lots of different requests (changing a screen) so long as you've put the effort into having set it up manually once before hand (creating the screen).


[16-Apr-25 10:46 AM] jab.sh#0000
I assumed that was how rprun worked too, interesting


[16-Apr-25 10:46 AM] jab.sh#0000
so I can close my BS buffers? 😄

{Reactions}
Yes 

[16-Apr-25 10:47 AM] harkenn#0000
Not to say that I disagree with the policy out of hand, its pragmatic, just unfortunate.


[16-Apr-25 10:47 AM] jab.sh#0000
yeah but a user isn't switching screens every 2 seconds


[16-Apr-25 10:47 AM] jab.sh#0000
a real api (with rate limits) would solve so much.


[16-Apr-25 10:48 AM] harkenn#0000
I'd say this is a separate (but related) UX issue. I was very surprised, starting out, that I couldn't switch screens via keybind (especially before installing rprun and it was 2 clicks everytime)


[16-Apr-25 10:49 AM] razenpok#0000
Changing a screen is a mechanism of the base game


[16-Apr-25 10:49 AM] razenpok#0000
They needed to draw a line for modders somewhere


[16-Apr-25 10:49 AM] razenpok#0000
But I agree with your stance


[16-Apr-25 10:50 AM] jcheung#0000
wait til you find out that apex actually has a keybind or two. ctrl + space opens a new buffer.... sometimes.

[16-Apr-25 10:50 AM] harkenn#0000

I don't begrudge the decisions made, when push comes to shove I think Mort's (still not 100% I'm remembering their name correctly) efforts are clearly better invested in game content, rather than UI UX (even having only just started playing).


[16-Apr-25 10:51 AM] razenpok#0000
Mort 💀

I've typed Mort so many times, I'm now liable to perpetually misnaming them. Did that with a neighbor's child, called him Rex for years. His name was not Rex. To this day I still can't think of him by any other name than Rex.

The cow emoji is actually a unicode emoji, so when its sent, its actually sent as its unicode character, not as the emoji code used to find it. Something like :antares_initiative: can be found by searching : antares_initiative : (without the spaces) though, because its not a unicode character

[16-Apr-25 03:09 PM] vanarazor#0000
you should talk to @razenpok


[16-Apr-25 04:05 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah we were talking about it back and forth ~6 hours ago. Apparently the concern/issue is that to make it function in a way that's useful, it would effectively guarantee updating numerous panels (sending off multiple requests) each time a user changes that input (so 1 user action resulting in multiple requests) which is one of the sticking points Molp has for QoL changes via extensions.

Spiciness is so crazy dependent on how much spicy stuff you eat, I've been told garlic is spicy before


[16-Apr-25 09:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair


[16-Apr-25 09:41 PM] tanda#0000
But nothing on Panda's menu has more than a bit of heat to it, at least according to my palate

it's got a little pepper icon on it on the menu so i think it's meant to be spicy

[16-Apr-25 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
i've gotten orange chicken from the store and it didn't have it and it feels like it's missing it


[16-Apr-25 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ah gotcha


[16-Apr-25 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i think its got a bit of it

idk i'd really have to compare them side by side


[16-Apr-25 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
If you like mildly spicy items, I would definitely say try Panda's Beijing Beef (if it's pretty fresh) or the Sweetfire Chicken


[16-Apr-25 09:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
the beijing beef is great and definitely only mildly spicy


[16-Apr-25 09:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's my usual order. I like a few pieces of orange chicken, but I feel like it's too sweet to eat a whole bowl of


[16-Apr-25 09:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Kungpao chicken is good in my opinion


[16-Apr-25 09:51 PM] tanda#0000
I try that one every so often. I just can't get past the texture of the peanuts


[16-Apr-25 09:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I like the peanuts


[16-Apr-25 10:12 PM] jvaler#0000

Those are fractions contracts. You’ll get them automatically from the game and are design to earn you a little bit on the side (tho you won’t get rich from them).
You don’t need to accept them and there isn’t really a penalty to breach them, if you do, but can’t fulfill them.

this mission is just asking you to make your first thing, then they will pay you 2500 credits and you will have to pick up some free stuff


[17-Apr-25 01:24 AM] jcheung#0000
until you get to the point where you get 3 random missions at the same time and picking one cancels the other two, all the contracts are really good and useful for learning

theres not actually that much reserved

oh i'm familiar with it


[17-Apr-25 11:32 AM] jab.sh#0000
yeah


[17-Apr-25 11:33 AM] jab.sh#0000
it just looks like a lot but in reality it's probably not


[17-Apr-25 11:34 AM] evany.#0000
its not really, fact is rfc1918 exists for private usage and 0.0 is for rib operations (software assignments) and there was a cgnat block added more recently (2004? ish- once v4 exhaustion was on the horizon)


[17-Apr-25 11:34 AM] evany.#0000
and a /8 is massive (10.x/8) but most service providers use the space so poorly that its actually not a lot of space


[17-Apr-25 11:35 AM] evany.#0000
its actually pretty typical for bng's to be configured with additional 1918 nat'd space for management and cwmp/tr069 because of lack of ip space in management or 'private' scopes


[17-Apr-25 11:36 AM] jab.sh#0000

I struggles to even make up fake words for this😭


[17-Apr-25 11:37 AM] evany.#0000
basically, customer facing pops where lots of customers are we'd built huge nat'd networks for management/single pane of glass stuff not unlike your home network


[17-Apr-25 11:37 AM] evany.#0000
and yeah your home router likely does reach out to a bng or some sort of aggregator


[17-Apr-25 11:37 AM] evany.#0000
its most likely your routers gateway ip address


[17-Apr-25 11:38 AM] evany.#0000
but thats just data plane for your device, management plane underneath it is probably 192.168/16 or 172.16/12


[17-Apr-25 11:38 AM] realharvey#0000
THOSE BACKSLASHES ARE WHAT CONFUSE ME


[17-Apr-25 11:38 AM] realharvey#0000
in ip adresses


[17-Apr-25 11:38 AM] realharvey#0000
haha


[17-Apr-25 11:39 AM] evany.#0000
typically in telco space i see 192.168/16 space used because 172.16/12 is reserved for interconnects (vpn endpoints and such)


[17-Apr-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
since when do IP adresses have slashes??


[17-Apr-25 11:39 AM] evany.#0000
aa harvey slashes are used to describe networks! 😄


[17-Apr-25 11:39 AM] evany.#0000
because its not a single address its a street name


[17-Apr-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
ohhh


[17-Apr-25 11:40 AM] evany.#0000
a lot of you are nerds so you probably know google is 8.8.8.8


[17-Apr-25 11:40 AM] realharvey#0000
I was told by our client that their network was accessed by some IP 1425.414.4522/28 or whatever


[17-Apr-25 11:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
so everyone who lives on "192.168" will have that number, then 2 more sets of numbers after? like : 192.168.34.65


[17-Apr-25 11:40 AM] evany.#0000
but 8.8.8.8 (well its weird but a bad example is still an example) its likely that 8.8.8.8 is probably 8.8.8.0/28


[17-Apr-25 11:40 AM] realharvey#0000
and my Network guy told me our IP is 142.4154.45


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] realharvey#0000
so it was close but not the same


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] realharvey#0000
and I was oO security alert


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] realharvey#0000
and he's like: Nah thats our Network


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] realharvey#0000
ITS DIFFERENT


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] realharvey#0000
`rant over`


[17-Apr-25 11:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah ur IT guy is smoking something


[17-Apr-25 11:42 AM] realharvey#0000
nah he was right. Its in our Network range


[17-Apr-25 11:42 AM] evany.#0000
so the different spaces like 192.168/16 is that (as dictated by rfc1918) means that its not publically routable (i.e should never be announced to the internet, in reality it actually can.. but i digress)
the point is you could 192.168.0/16 and set your gateway to 192.168.0.1 (probably default) and set your printer to 192.168.254.200) and it would still be reachable provided you hit the right netmask

typically you see /24 used in home operation because its weird that you would see a house with 253+ devices connected


[17-Apr-25 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
your network guy told you that?? hire a new one!! lmao


[17-Apr-25 11:43 AM] realharvey#0000
those IP Examples have been bullshit


[17-Apr-25 11:43 AM] realharvey#0000
dont wanna expose those


[17-Apr-25 11:44 AM] evany.#0000
don't need specifics - anything with 4 integers per octet is drunk or typo


[17-Apr-25 11:44 AM] jab.sh#0000
so CGNAT?


[17-Apr-25 11:44 AM] realharvey#0000
that was me making something up


[17-Apr-25 11:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
is there some kind of correlation between /24 and 253+ devices?


[17-Apr-25 11:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
I feel like its 2^24 or something


[17-Apr-25 11:45 AM] jab.sh#0000
/16 is the bitmask, in this instance that means the IP range is from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] evany.#0000
kind of yes but reverse
since as a national isp you will likely have all the same devices communicating and you might have tens of thousands of customers in some dense areas so you'll see for example 192.168.0/18 used all over the place (because the traffic doesn't leave the local POP there is no collisions)
cgnat would imply that it actually traverses beyond the endpoint typically though so you wouldn't call it cgnat, but not dissimilar


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] realharvey#0000
Ip was 68.679.32.0/19 and our Network is 68.679.39.36


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] realharvey#0000
and because 32 and 39 are not the same I got confused


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] jab.sh#0000
each octet can be 0-255


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] evany.#0000
when people refer to blocks i.e /24 or /22 its as jab pointed out earlier its bitwise math- each one is a byte which is 8 bits


[17-Apr-25 11:46 AM] jab.sh#0000
2^8

{Reactions}
👍 

[17-Apr-25 11:47 AM] jab.sh#0000
an 8 bit unsigned integer


[17-Apr-25 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
so a /24 is 256 addresses (after network addres, gateway, broadcast) your left with only space for 253 addresses


[17-Apr-25 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
a /25 is only 128 addresses total (-3 = 125 usable address)


[17-Apr-25 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
likewise if you go to a /23 (doubling the size rather than halving) youll go to 512 (509 usable)


[17-Apr-25 11:48 AM] evany.#0000
i really never thought i'd be talking networking here


[17-Apr-25 11:48 AM] realharvey#0000
what does /19 do then?


[17-Apr-25 11:48 AM] jab.sh#0000
if I change this to a real IP (68.79.32.0/19) the range is 68.79.32.0 to 68.79.63.255


[17-Apr-25 11:48 AM] evany.#0000
a /19 is like 4000 addresses if memory serves


[17-Apr-25 11:48 AM] jab.sh#0000
8000 😛

[17-Apr-25 11:50 AM] evany.#0000
nothing uses /1


[17-Apr-25 11:51 AM] jab.sh#0000
for private networks, you have 3 ranges you can use: 10.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12
you can either just use the whole range, or subdivide it if you want to get advanced (like in a corporate setting, 10.0.0.0/16 might be used for cameras, 10.1.0.0/16 might be used for guest wifi, 10.2.0.0/16 might be used for desk drops (ethernet), etc)


[17-Apr-25 11:51 AM] realharvey#0000
so 68.79.31.0 would not be in that range?


[17-Apr-25 11:51 AM] jab.sh#0000
correct


[17-Apr-25 11:52 AM] evany.#0000
yep


[17-Apr-25 11:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
that makes sense, so where do /25, /24 and /23 come from if thats are that you can use?


[17-Apr-25 11:52 AM] jab.sh#0000
like I said you can subdivide it (make the / number bigger)


[17-Apr-25 11:52 AM] evany.#0000
and so in range /xx typically denotes netmask - and anything not in that network as determined by netmask will go to "DR" or default route
(your gateway)


[17-Apr-25 11:52 AM] jab.sh#0000
like you could do 10.1.2.0/24 for some devices (and that would be 10.1.2.0 to 10.1.2.255)


[17-Apr-25 11:53 AM] realharvey#0000
Why does our client get displayed this IP: 68.679.32.0/19 and my Company says its going out with 68.679.39.36?

lets assume for a second that this does not help me in any way. 😂


[17-Apr-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
OHH, its like an umbrella, and the /n defines how big your umbrella is, and so the 253 device that go through the router (?) with IP of 10.1.2.0, are in the umbrella of 10.1.2.0/24


[17-Apr-25 11:55 AM] jab.sh#0000
yeah


[17-Apr-25 11:55 AM] evany.#0000
you can use as much or as little as you want

so my house has two vpn's built into my router 
one of those networks i have mapped to 192.168.48.0/22 the other is 192.168.58.0/22

then i use 192.168.0.0/24 for my house (wifi, laptop, pc's) then i have IoT stuff (lights, motion sensors) on 192.168.1.0/24 and then i have guest 192.168.3.0/24 my renters with 2.0/24 reserved for my security cameras when i wire them


[17-Apr-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000

I had guest wifi set up once, and then I changed something and it broke, so I gave up for a while. then I bought a u7 pro and basically this 😄
https://canary.discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183249178156089374/1362111781874565392


[17-Apr-25 12:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
but I have (had now) a nighthawk running ddwrt (with one port configured with a vlan that guest wifi was set to use), then I ran two cables to a mikrotik switch, and a pfsense router.


[17-Apr-25 12:28 PM] evany.#0000
ah so client isolation in a lot of vendors ap's is basically just a firewall rule only allowing hosts to talk to the gateway but typically a firewall operates at layer 3, this is more like a whitelist with reverse arp on layer 2 since access point only understands frames


[17-Apr-25 12:28 PM] evany.#0000
the concern with that is it can break things that rely on things like multicast


[17-Apr-25 12:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
I don't understand how the AP is preventing my guest device from just like traversing the ip space to see other devices. like once it's past the AP and on the switch/router, what's keeping it from looking around


[17-Apr-25 12:29 PM] evany.#0000
ah wireless ap doesn't really understand IP - it works on frame


[17-Apr-25 12:30 PM] jab.sh#0000
specifically for the guest wifi? yeah I don't care about that 😄


[17-Apr-25 12:30 PM] evany.#0000
the difference there is when initialized typically it will go hey whats my gateway (if its 192.168.0.1 for example) its gonna go "ok whats my mac address for 192.168.0.1" okay its aa:bb
okay great, now i have a new client - jabscoolnewphone which is aa : bb : dd


[17-Apr-25 12:31 PM] evany.#0000
and then it will just allow aa bb dd to only talk to aa bb


[17-Apr-25 12:31 PM] jab.sh#0000
so like if I have a packet with a destination of 192.168.1.10 does the AP just drop it?


[17-Apr-25 12:32 PM] jab.sh#0000
and vice versa, if something on my lan tries to talk to the guest device, the AP drops that too?


[17-Apr-25 12:32 PM] evany.#0000
so "it depends"


[17-Apr-25 12:32 PM] jab.sh#0000
now I wonder why I couldn't just do this on ddwrt 😄


[17-Apr-25 12:32 PM] jab.sh#0000
but the new AP is so much nicer, more range and speed, so no regrets there


[17-Apr-25 12:33 PM] evany.#0000
you can successfully do it on layer 2 and layer 3


[17-Apr-25 12:33 PM] evany.#0000
i think layer 2 is more common for access points since they don't need to be aware of the IP layer
so if you send to 192.168.1.10 and its within your network (arp -a on windows)


[17-Apr-25 12:34 PM] evany.#0000
to you - you might see you did like \\192.168.1.10\ to hit SMB in windows explorer or something but in reality the operating system is actually just going 'hey bd : 69 got a frame for ya"


[17-Apr-25 12:34 PM] evany.#0000
and the access point is saying whoa there aa : bb hold on a second there chump, that doesn't exist!


[17-Apr-25 12:34 PM] evany.#0000
in reality it does exist, but your not permitted to talk to it because its not a gateway- thats client isolation at work


[17-Apr-25 12:36 PM] jab.sh#0000
vlans (ip) are layer 3, frames (mac address) are layer 2 right?


[17-Apr-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
typically i'd expect that it would just drop the frame, but i haven't done any real testing on that.


[17-Apr-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
so thats just theory/educated guess


[17-Apr-25 12:36 PM] evany.#0000
yessir


[17-Apr-25 12:37 PM] evany.#0000
communication will always happen closest to the operating system if possible following the OSI model

[17-Apr-25 12:40 PM] jab.sh#0000
my holdup is I wouldn't think the AP would be on layer 3 (unless I set up vlans or something), so once the traffic hits layer 3 what's stopping it


[17-Apr-25 12:40 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm grabbing lunch now I'll read what you said in a minute


[17-Apr-25 12:45 PM] evany.#0000
this gets convoluted a bit because now your talking about hardware design a little bit 
now your looking at chipsets and what is exactly running under the hood, physically vendors are cheap so they aren't going to make a access point that is aware of things like IP unless they give it a 'router mode' because why spend 9 dollars for an IP aware switch connected to the wireless antenna rather than a 7 dollar one that just acts like a bridge and passes the entire frame. 

thats where youll sometimes see the tag 'vlan aware' on the box


[17-Apr-25 12:45 PM] harkenn#0000
> i think layer 2 is more common for access points since they don't need to be aware of the IP layer

Is this true regardless of how APs are configured with the router? I would think mesh networking would turn this statement on its head.


[17-Apr-25 12:46 PM] harkenn#0000
Not to say that I'm informed on the matter, I just would've assumed that mesh topologies would necessitate sufficient routing complexity that the APs would *have* to be IP aware.


[17-Apr-25 12:49 PM] evany.#0000
if you step away from hardware though and just look at raw networking - if the traffic hits layer 3 whats stopping it, nothing- just an ip firewall would be next
but its important to note that it will just be a frame if its within the same netmask (the frame won't get rebuilt by any next hop like it does traditionally) 
if your 192.168.0.40/24 reaching to 192.168.0.10/24 then the entire frame is delivered
if its 192.168.0.40/24 trying to reach 192.168.1.10/24 then the entire frame is delivered to the gateway 
the router looks at it and goes "oh, this isnt local i will throw it in my default route- he rips open your frame and replaces it with his information then hands it to the connected or default route (dependant on if 1.0/24 is in its route table) but the packet stays intact but this is where it would look at firewall rules and to see if it even should be rebuilt or if it should be dropped!

a firewall rule blocking 0.10 from talking to 0.40 wouldn't work because the firewall rule would never be triggered since the communication happened at layer 2


[17-Apr-25 12:57 PM] evany.#0000
yeaaaaah this is fair critique, but "mesh" it really just sales terminology don't even get me started on "sdwan" 

most access points fundamentally are just a wireless transceiver/receiver speaking 802.11 connected to a physical switch (to plugin and sometimes power the AP via PoE)
'mesh' is just two wireless transceivers and a physical switch interconnected that allows your access point to feed another access point nearby

just because they can communicate with each other doesn't mean they are vlan or IP aware though, like i said vendors are cheap ( when i left my last national isp  we were paying around 7$ per ONT/router combo unit)
typically if you have a function that allows you to put the access point in 'router mode' the chipset clearly supports it, but my experience with ubiquiti's old m2 wireless units was it cut performance by about 30-40%


[17-Apr-25 12:58 PM] harkenn#0000
Yikes, that's a bigger hit than I would've expected. Is that independent of network size or just what you measured at the particular scale you were using that hardware?


[17-Apr-25 12:59 PM] evany.#0000
just 1:1 laptop <-> internal speed test server


[17-Apr-25 12:59 PM] evany.#0000
it gets even worse with truly "mesh" networks because all wireless speaks at half speed


[17-Apr-25 01:00 PM] evany.#0000
so if you get a solution where laptop <-> router <-> access point 1 <-> access point 2 <-> test laptop 2
you're probably only gonna see 30-40% throughput


[17-Apr-25 01:28 PM] jab.sh#0000
well, I know the u7 pro can do vlans, so it definitely has layer 3 capabilities. and most home wifi routers do NAT, so they need layer 3 too


[17-Apr-25 01:29 PM] jab.sh#0000
so if something on my lan is trying to reach something on guest, the AP will see the mac address doesn't match the router and drop it?


[17-Apr-25 01:30 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm trying to remember if my guest is in the same /24


[17-Apr-25 01:44 PM] jab.sh#0000
and if I try an IP that's not in the arp cache, won't the AP just pass it on


[17-Apr-25 01:48 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i haven't done a ubiquiti ap for a few years but they are definitely vlan aware, i should add that i might have conflated ip & vlan aware but they are not necessarily the same thing. There probably is switch chips that are vlan aware but don't do IP, and probably some that are IP but not vlan aware. its a pretty common dilineation in microwave/fixed wireless like LTE where i have cell phones on specific vlans but the device doesnt speak IP or anything layer3 on the wireless side (it does do layer 3 on the LTE Core "EPC" but I digress)


[17-Apr-25 01:49 PM] jab.sh#0000
can you explain how you can be vlan aware without being ip aware


[17-Apr-25 01:50 PM] evany.#0000
but yeah client isolation goes both ways, if your router has 8 ports / switched interfaces and port 7 is your access point/wireless and port 8 is your PC, it would fail during client isolation the same where the access list for the cam table (mac address reversed) doesn't match the gateway so it will also be dropped


[17-Apr-25 01:50 PM] jab.sh#0000
is cam different from arp


[17-Apr-25 01:50 PM] jab.sh#0000
this is the first I've heard of cam table


[17-Apr-25 01:50 PM] evany.#0000
oh that parts easy, because ip's don't exist on vlans, they CAN exist on vlans (but typically they are referred to as "SVI" when a vlan is layer3-aware)


[17-Apr-25 01:51 PM] jab.sh#0000
I guess this explains it 😄 <https://www.greycampus.com/opencampus/ethical-hacking/arp-and-cam-cable>


[17-Apr-25 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
so arp is just the layer 3 perspective of a mac address table


[17-Apr-25 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
and yeah that explains it well


[17-Apr-25 01:52 PM] jab.sh#0000
I've read that switches have an 'arp cache' (or was it mac cache?) but this makes that sound like a lie 😄


[17-Apr-25 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
so if its an unmanaged switch it very likely is just a single bridge (sometimes called a bdi in cisco ios xe speak)


[17-Apr-25 01:53 PM] jab.sh#0000
right, that's the kind I'm thinking about


[17-Apr-25 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
but in linux kernel at least its just a bridge


[17-Apr-25 01:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
I just mean this part
> The CAM table, or content addressable memory table, is present in all switches for layer 2 switching.


[17-Apr-25 01:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
cam != arp


[17-Apr-25 01:54 PM] evany.#0000

[17-Apr-25 01:55 PM] evany.#0000
arp is layer 2 from layer 3 perspective because typically host in layer 3/4 as part of their discovery will do 'gratutious arp' if you play in wireshark at all you wil see them "hi im   172.10.16.3, who is 172.10.16.1?" (replace with whatever gateway you learned)


[17-Apr-25 01:55 PM] jab.sh#0000
I think in my head I conflated mac and arp


[17-Apr-25 01:55 PM] evany.#0000
similiar but not the same


[17-Apr-25 01:55 PM] jab.sh#0000
yep


[17-Apr-25 01:56 PM] evany.#0000
and when your host sees  a gratitous arp from another host via broadcast (those pesky multicast ranges that "take up space" we talked about earlier) the arp table will remember "oh bb:cc:dd was 172.10.16.9"

{Reactions}
😆 

[17-Apr-25 01:57 PM] evany.#0000
from then on your box knows if he wants to talk to 16.9 he doesn't have to talk to the gateway and make it a packet, he can talk directly to bb:cc:dd once arp is established!


[17-Apr-25 01:57 PM] evany.#0000
(its still made a packet as the payload inside the frame.. but splitting hairs..)


[17-Apr-25 01:57 PM] jab.sh#0000
and the switch will just pass it on without the gateway even knowing


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] evany.#0000
yep


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] evany.#0000
which is why a wirewall is useless in that situation


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
so if your gateway is a firewall, there's no way to prevent that traffic


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] jab.sh#0000

[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] evany.#0000
and its why client isolation is a thing!


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
what about the situation where the mac/cam table is empty


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] evany.#0000
there are some brands (mikrotik!) that supports layer 2 firewalls


[17-Apr-25 01:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
wait what


[17-Apr-25 01:59 PM] evany.#0000
but it can do that because its ultimately just a linux box


[17-Apr-25 01:59 PM] jab.sh#0000
switches will forward the packet onto all ports, I assume the AP will forward it on too right?


[17-Apr-25 01:59 PM] evany.#0000
thats all an AP is, is a two port switch (one port being wireless and the other physical)


[17-Apr-25 02:00 PM] jab.sh#0000
how does client isolation work when the mac/cam table is empty


[17-Apr-25 02:00 PM] evany.#0000
thats a good question i suppose each vendor would handle it differently


[17-Apr-25 02:00 PM] evany.#0000
one thing i'd say is if you had an empty mac table - it means the switch is broken


[17-Apr-25 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
since a 24 port switch will likely have 25 mac addresses in it typically


[17-Apr-25 02:01 PM] jab.sh#0000
maybe not completely empty


[17-Apr-25 02:01 PM] jab.sh#0000
but like a new switch/fresh boot/whatever


[17-Apr-25 02:01 PM] jab.sh#0000
it hasn't seen any packets yet


[17-Apr-25 02:01 PM] evany.#0000
but in an example of you plu gging a laptop into just port 24 into the switch and nothing else plugged in


[17-Apr-25 02:02 PM] jab.sh#0000
there are some brands (mikrotik!) that


[17-Apr-25 02:03 PM] evany.#0000
your pc would do a gratitous arp and say hey whatup new kid on the block and when it didn't get a reply from a dhcp server welcoming it with "hey wanna be known as $this ip address" it just would take a random 169.254.0/16 address


[17-Apr-25 02:03 PM] evany.#0000
most traffic wouldn't traverse the switch if you loaded a website it just simply wouldn't leave your pc because your pc has no default gateway, so no frame would hit the switch


[17-Apr-25 02:03 PM] evany.#0000
but broadcast traffic still would and should be sent out every port on the switch


[17-Apr-25 02:03 PM] evany.#0000
(every admin-UP port on the switch)


[17-Apr-25 02:04 PM] evany.#0000
if the port is down/down (physical/admin states)


[17-Apr-25 02:04 PM] jab.sh#0000
so until I manually configure my interface with an ip and a gateway, my pc just talks to itself

I personally do naval combat :3


[18-Apr-25 11:46 AM] avalock#0000
And logistics


[18-Apr-25 11:46 AM] avalock#0000
I like Naval cause its cool, and collies are afraid of water


[18-Apr-25 11:46 AM] avalock#0000
(Its in the lore)


[18-Apr-25 11:54 AM] razenpok#0000
I like wardens, but I decided to try collies first


[18-Apr-25 11:55 AM] razenpok#0000
So, collies for this war


[18-Apr-25 11:55 AM] avalock#0000
:Sigh:

And its not full, that’s just developer lies


[18-Apr-25 11:56 AM] razenpok#0000
iirc I could not join it


[18-Apr-25 11:56 AM] razenpok#0000
But maybe I'm imagining it


[18-Apr-25 11:56 AM] avalock#0000
Try again, it’ll give you an error and then try again

Here, I'll treat you to a log of my undoings against wardens


[18-Apr-25 11:57 AM] razenpok#0000
April 18
Server: Charlie
Faction: Collies
Duration: 3 hours playtime
Start: Amethyst
Loadout: Recon camo, hangman, 3x .44 ammo, pistol, 3x 8mm ammo, binoculars, wrench, radio, 2x bandages

Log:
Went to The Foundry via Stray and Vagrant Bastion
Blew up 1 railroad section on the edge of a map
Went to Moon's Copse
Stole a truck blocked the road
Escaped a chase after that, ran to Westmarch
Emptied a salvage mine (materials+fuel), dislocated fuel storage with a crane
Stole a crane from the salvage mine, blocked the road
A minute after that, a supply truck (2 people) with a towed 68 mm cannon got stuck in that road block
Juked the bois, stole the truck, ran over the poor guys
Hid the cannon, dropped the supply crates, ran the truck into a relic base in a way to also block the road
Went to Sun's Hollow, nothing there
Went to The Roilfort, stole a crane, blocked the road
Got chased by an LUV, escaped to Goldenroot Ranch
Stole a flatbed truck, blocked the road
Emptied salvage mine (materials+fuel)
Ran into some other partisan guys, joined them and got killed 2 minutes later lol

Notes:
Every time I left a vehicle behind, I drained and hid the fuel and locked the vehicle
On top of all that, every time I ran into a railroad signal, I changed its direction (a dozen or so in total)


[18-Apr-25 11:58 AM] avalock#0000
Oh shir you’re writing it out, this is great

Once again I sorely wish I had images of my WC82 Eidolo firebase.


[18-Apr-25 12:46 PM] potaterror#0000
5x 150mm and often 3-5 120mms with on-site storage for something like 5K rounds each IIRC, Eidolo had factorys, a refinery, and sulfur nearby at the time, and at points all of the big guns were firing at max cadence nonstop for literally hours.

Or are you a baller and that’s all silver?

just my way of remembering to sell them. Collector I agree, I think I'm going to make a base for SD because it seems profitable for me.

[22-Apr-25 06:51 PM] jvaler#0000
but that's why the hacker player brings swarm clear like vulcan


[22-Apr-25 06:52 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm hovering steady around 400 rn


[22-Apr-25 06:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Pretty sure I'm still sub 200


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
oh geez


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] jcheung#0000
I wasn't kidding


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
lolol


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] jvaler#0000
how many hrs?


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] .shiva.#0000
hackers are really not very good tbh


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] jcheung#0000
Not many hrs tbh


[22-Apr-25 06:54 PM] .shiva.#0000
I was playing a lot for a while


[22-Apr-25 06:55 PM] .shiva.#0000
they're insanely situational, and pretty easily countered


[22-Apr-25 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
what do u consider a counter?


[22-Apr-25 06:56 PM] .shiva.#0000
air, chaff


[22-Apr-25 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that sounds about right


[22-Apr-25 06:56 PM] jvaler#0000
there's lots of ground aoe in the game, air aoe options are limited and niche


[22-Apr-25 06:56 PM] .shiva.#0000
if a hacker is doing work, it's because they fucked up and didn't put enough chaff / put big units too far up


[22-Apr-25 06:57 PM] .shiva.#0000
you'll basically never see them as you climb in mmr


[22-Apr-25 06:57 PM] jvaler#0000
interesting


[22-Apr-25 06:57 PM] jcheung#0000
That was my observation from watching others play


[22-Apr-25 06:58 PM] .shiva.#0000
I didn't really play last season, but Id say <1k MMR is mostly people learning the game still


[22-Apr-25 06:58 PM] .shiva.#0000
and all sorts of wacky shit happens


[22-Apr-25 06:59 PM] .shiva.#0000
a lot of stuff will stop working / get stomped as you starting climbing over 1k


[22-Apr-25 06:59 PM] jvaler#0000
is the rank distribution displayed anywhere?


[22-Apr-25 06:59 PM] .shiva.#0000
not that I know


[22-Apr-25 06:59 PM] jvaler#0000
rip


[22-Apr-25 07:00 PM] jvaler#0000
i used to bully people with stormcallers in my placement matches, but now everyone knows to counter them with missile defence mustangs


[22-Apr-25 07:02 PM] .shiva.#0000
my gut feeling was:
<800 - probably doesn't know what lots of the units do / can do with tech, or how to counter
800-1k - probably know most of the units and roughly what counters them
1-1.2k - knows a few comps, and generally how to play, knows what all the units are decent at
1.2-1.4 - knows a comp or two well, and doesn't make large mistakes often
...


[22-Apr-25 07:03 PM] .shiva.#0000
storms were very OP for quite a while


[22-Apr-25 07:03 PM] .shiva.#0000
think they've been reigned in quite a bit. and mustand missle defense got way buffed


[22-Apr-25 07:03 PM] .shiva.#0000
it's maybe too strong now


[22-Apr-25 07:04 PM] .shiva.#0000
imo storms shouldn't be an opening unit, and they could be a bit stronger


[22-Apr-25 07:04 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah they're really risky as an opening unit


[22-Apr-25 07:04 PM] jvaler#0000
total gamble on what your opponent gets


[22-Apr-25 07:05 PM] jvaler#0000
if they get only sabertooths or medium tanks or arclight or snipers gg ez


[22-Apr-25 07:05 PM] jvaler#0000
but if they have any kind of swarm 75% chance you lose


[22-Apr-25 07:06 PM] .shiva.#0000
no chaff units == loss


[22-Apr-25 07:06 PM] .shiva.#0000
chaff is the most important part of the game


[22-Apr-25 07:07 PM] .shiva.#0000
in general, new players dont build nearly as much chaff* as they should


[22-Apr-25 07:07 PM] jvaler#0000
build?


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
a lot of new players don't put down enough chaff


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
at all


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] jvaler#0000
ohh


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] jcheung#0000
I think last time i played i put down all chaff and got my ass handed to me


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] jcheung#0000
😄


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
in general, should probably have at least 2, probably 3 waves of chaff that are arriving


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] .shiva.#0000
I mean it's always a mix


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] .shiva.#0000
can't go just chaff, but a lot of people skip building any at the start since bigger == better, or something


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] jcheung#0000
(My poor excuse was that i was trying to copy someone who had just beat me up with just chaff)


[22-Apr-25 07:10 PM] jvaler#0000
real lmao


[22-Apr-25 07:10 PM] jvaler#0000
you loss to something stupid "wait that actually works?" then try it and learn it in fact does not

but you need to take some of his recommendations with a grain of salt


[22-Apr-25 07:11 PM] .shiva.#0000
since he plays super aggro all the time


[22-Apr-25 07:13 PM] .shiva.#0000
some of it is actually a little outdated now, isn't updated for sabertooths being a starter for example


[22-Apr-25 07:16 PM] .shiva.#0000
emp is the other thing that's huge, you need to have some available on your tech options


[22-Apr-25 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
ooh ty


[22-Apr-25 07:17 PM] .shiva.#0000
watch it on like 1.5x+ lol


[22-Apr-25 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
why's that? i can't really tell it making a difference


[22-Apr-25 07:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
eh, probably doesnt atm. but you'll straight up lose games without having it available


[22-Apr-25 07:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
like a melting point with absorb will be unkillable


[22-Apr-25 07:18 PM] jvaler#0000
OH i never thought to do that to counter that


[22-Apr-25 07:18 PM] jvaler#0000
i've run into that before


[22-Apr-25 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000
this is round 10/12 where i first added hackers
i honestly don't think they were even that good here, dude's just mad

[22-Apr-25 07:48 PM] .shiva.#0000
yeah so he has no chaff in front


[22-Apr-25 07:49 PM] .shiva.#0000
so those hackers probably locked onto the steel balls right away


[22-Apr-25 07:51 PM] .shiva.#0000

Wacha need on hep, i have to double check but i should have spare capacity going to hep within the next 3-4 days


[24-Apr-25 04:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Haylos too, but, uh... that might take longer than 0 days


[24-Apr-25 04:17 PM] jab.sh#0000
longer than 0 days? smh


[24-Apr-25 04:19 PM] jcheung#0000
WCB should be going from HEP > ANT > HAY starting in... idk, sometime tonight or tomorrow morning if you're interested
If not interested, then HEP > HAY


[24-Apr-25 04:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh man, I wish there were settler bundles on the market right now, that would make this really easy


[24-Apr-25 04:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just need to send out 10 days of settler consumables plus RCO. I might send you a shipping contract


[24-Apr-25 04:21 PM] jcheung#0000
Okay. Should depart ANT tomorrow morning then, i think


[24-Apr-25 04:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh wait. I mixed up halcyon and haylos.
Well, if you have some SI or SIO out there to sell ill still take your consumables out 😂


[24-Apr-25 04:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
Hyalos is low priority for me right now 😄


[24-Apr-25 04:24 PM] jab.sh#0000
only MOR has bundles


[24-Apr-25 04:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
anyone want to give me some MOR money for AIC 👀


[24-Apr-25 04:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
which one is MOR money again? NCC?


[24-Apr-25 04:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
idk 😄


[24-Apr-25 04:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
I'm considering moving some bundles to ant though


[24-Apr-25 04:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
but yeah if it's less than 1M you don't even need to ask, just send me conts


[24-Apr-25 04:26 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah I might be sending you some tonight. need to figure out how much I want to spend


[24-Apr-25 04:26 PM] jcheung#0000
Got SI or SIO you don't want out there? If you can fill half a WCB with goodies i can still go out that way


[24-Apr-25 04:26 PM] jcheung#0000
Or whatever it is you make


[24-Apr-25 04:27 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes


[24-Apr-25 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's got uhh 200 SI and 90 SIO rn


[24-Apr-25 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
so if that makes the trip worth it for you lmk


[24-Apr-25 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Any other products you make out there?


[24-Apr-25 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
It's good enough though, AI.1 ASK work for you?


[24-Apr-25 04:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
LIT, but those are all earmarked for the AGC rn


[24-Apr-25 04:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
and definitely - I'll send you some cash for the shipping contract too


[24-Apr-25 04:33 PM] jcheung#0000
Okay. Yeah, don't want LIT unfortunately 😂


[24-Apr-25 04:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
sent ya the Hyalos contract. if you can accept it rq so it auto-provisions the stuff, that would be awesone. that way I don't put it all on other ships 😄


[24-Apr-25 04:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I uhh messed up the payments so enjoy the 80k. my mistake is your gain 😆


[24-Apr-25 04:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Hahaha. I've done that so many times

Piss me right off they do


[24-Apr-25 04:35 PM] jcheung#0000
I'll get it back to you when i send conts for the SI and SIO when I get home


[24-Apr-25 04:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
nah keep it, it's worth it for the extra shipping 😄


[24-Apr-25 04:37 PM] sidepipe#0000

[26-Apr-25 08:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
How you gonna do that lol


[26-Apr-25 08:20 AM] jab.sh#0000
huh SAL already has a 37d ROI


[26-Apr-25 08:20 AM] jab.sh#0000
not too shabby


[26-Apr-25 02:28 PM] loans_13178#0000
I was hopping someone would be willing to buy it all out and then resell it at a much higher margin, I would be able to sell it at that higher price. Say 10000-11500 AIC/ unit.


[26-Apr-25 02:31 PM] laaxus#0000
that's not how market works


[26-Apr-25 02:31 PM] laaxus#0000
if you think SAL price is too cheap, then buy it and do something with it


[26-Apr-25 02:35 PM] loans_13178#0000
Again a great idea I did not consider.


[26-Apr-25 02:36 PM] tanda#0000
SAL's pricepoint is actually pretty great, COGS is only 2500


[26-Apr-25 02:37 PM] tanda#0000
which means allocater's massive buy order is profitable


[26-Apr-25 02:38 PM] laaxus#0000
if you want to enter the SAL market because it's fun, I have nothing to say


[26-Apr-25 02:38 PM] laaxus#0000
however, if you want to enter the SAL market as a mean to make money, please reconsider


[26-Apr-25 02:39 PM] laaxus#0000
for a new player, ROI is king


[26-Apr-25 02:39 PM] laaxus#0000
and ROI on such high cost bases is very very low


[26-Apr-25 02:40 PM] laaxus#0000
you should aim for a roi of under 20 for each of your base, ideally sub 15, sub 10 is even possible


[26-Apr-25 02:41 PM] tanda#0000
SAL only base is not too bad of return at 43 days, but yeah. That's a lot of capital tied up


[26-Apr-25 02:41 PM] loans_13178#0000
Yeah, definitely struggling to figure out a good ROI considering I think I've been fumbling most things.


[26-Apr-25 02:42 PM] jab.sh#0000
is it 43 already? it was 37 this morning


[26-Apr-25 02:43 PM] loans_13178#0000

here's a list of base you should take a look at
- CHP (CL) on griffonstone Origo
- PP1  (BDE) on nike 
- BMP (EXO or MCG) on hephaestus
- WPL (NL) on hephaestus
- FP (RAT DW COF)  on norwick
- GF (GL) on deimos/vulcan
- POL (PG or EPO) on griffon / origo
- INC (C) (forgot the planet)

What are the MM changes, I don't fully understand those?


[26-Apr-25 02:49 PM] laaxus#0000
MM are materials you can sell at a fixed price


[26-Apr-25 02:50 PM] laaxus#0000
the different MM just got balanced, and therefore the meta for MM changed


[26-Apr-25 02:51 PM] laaxus#0000
People sell to MM because it is a reliable way to have a great profit per permit (at the cost of a very low roi, so don't look at it for now, focus on roi)

for a regular ticket sure, but renting out the whole theater should be a better discount

nah, how are they supposed to make their profits then


[30-Apr-25 08:20 PM] jvaler#0000
shouldn't renting out the theater come at a premium because it blocks seats from other people not in your group?


[30-Apr-25 08:20 PM] tanda#0000
if you do matinee tickets that's usually cheaper


[30-Apr-25 08:20 PM] jvaler#0000
not that theaters are booming nowadays... lmao


[30-Apr-25 08:21 PM] jab.sh#0000
if you rent it out that's guaranteed revenue for the theater, otherwise there's a risk that they'd sell less tickets that night


[30-Apr-25 08:25 PM] jvaler#0000
i suppose


[30-Apr-25 08:26 PM] jvaler#0000
plus you have to schedule it ahead of time so it doesn't really block anyone, they can also just schedule around you


[30-Apr-25 08:27 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah exactly. guaranteed revenue is generally preferred over potential revenue, even if it's a bit lower


[30-Apr-25 08:41 PM] jcheung#0000
oh! there's a second one?


[30-Apr-25 08:41 PM] jcheung#0000

eh, i guess i'll wait until netflix has it or something


[30-Apr-25 08:44 PM] jcheung#0000
let's see... if i match whatever the heck laser is, this is why i said "not bad", but then again it probably also costs way more than 230 to rent out the place for me too


[30-Apr-25 08:44 PM] jcheung#0000

[30-Apr-25 08:49 PM] jvaler#0000
we watched the first one at home a week ago so i could go see it with him


[30-Apr-25 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, now see, this would be worth it. looking at normal price is basically half off


[30-Apr-25 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000
but the problem is, ofc, that i donly have 39 other people to go with


[30-Apr-25 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000
i might count for two, but that's about it


[30-Apr-25 08:50 PM] jvaler#0000

[30-Apr-25 08:50 PM] sidepipe#0000

[30-Apr-25 08:51 PM] jcheung#0000
it's been many years since i last saw that


[30-Apr-25 08:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
It’s not the greatest Star Wars movie, but I imagine it’d be great in theaters


[30-Apr-25 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
didn't lucas make THX specifically just to make theatres better?


[30-Apr-25 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
google time


[30-Apr-25 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, lucas got mad at how badly the audio was for return of the jedi was being played in theatres and bullied the movie industry into having some standards for audio


[30-Apr-25 09:27 PM] jab.sh#0000

[01-May-25 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
minecraft movie was absolute cinema


[01-May-25 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I went to watch it, thinking it would be atrociously bad


[01-May-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
we were like, 20 in the entire theater (for like 500 available places ?)


[01-May-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
and I had unironically a great time


[01-May-25 05:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The opinions I heard about it a really diverse. I myself liked the visuals, but was a bit disappoint by the story arc. It felt like a generic movie with a Minecraft theme

💯 

[01-May-25 05:28 AM] laaxus#0000
if you look at it with a serious eye, it's like a 3/10


[01-May-25 05:28 AM] laaxus#0000
if you look at it with the same eye as you'd watch kung fury, it's a 8/10


[01-May-25 05:29 AM] laaxus#0000
it's basically a 1h30 ytp


[01-May-25 05:29 AM] laaxus#0000
loved it


[01-May-25 08:15 AM] tanda#0000
ytp is definitely something I forgot about


[01-May-25 10:08 AM] jab.sh#0000

[01-May-25 11:53 AM] laaxus#0000

[01-May-25 11:53 AM] avalock#0000

I just don’t watch many/any movies in theaters


[01-May-25 11:57 AM] realharvey#0000
I personally didnt like the Minecraft Movie. The humor was to "cringe" for me.

👍 

[01-May-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Nah the pre rendered cut is gold


[01-May-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Lowkey fits the movie


[01-May-25 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
It was 10/10


[01-May-25 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
I loved the indian gambling ads

💀 

[01-May-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
I pirated it and was laughing so much when the pandas was running away with the most goofy animation🤣🤣


[01-May-25 11:58 AM] avalock#0000
And how some of the villagers werent animated so it was some persons actual head


[01-May-25 11:58 AM] laaxus#0000
understandable
Objectively, it's like a 2 or 3/10
But if you watch it as basically a 1h30 brainrot tiktok, it's very good


[01-May-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah fr


[01-May-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Its not a good movie


[01-May-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
But its hilarious if you set your expectations to 0


[01-May-25 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
I felt like watching kung fury


[01-May-25 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
or an abridged series


[01-May-25 12:00 PM] jab.sh#0000
what is the "pre rendered cut"?


[01-May-25 12:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
Like, theres some charachters with no textures, the green screen lines are still there, animations are very basic, etc..


[01-May-25 12:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
No idea who leaked it


[01-May-25 12:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
But like everyone has that version


[01-May-25 12:04 PM] jab.sh#0000
neat


[01-May-25 12:07 PM] avalock#0000
Yeeeee its pretty good :3


[01-May-25 01:53 PM] loans_13178#0000
