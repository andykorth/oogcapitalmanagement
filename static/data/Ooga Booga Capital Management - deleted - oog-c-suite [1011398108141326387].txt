@Shipwright @deleted-role @deleted-role @deleted-role @CEO The c-suite is for us to communicate about corp matters in an attempt to declutter other channels. Only these roles have permission to edit but all have permission to view.

Thanks for setting this up - by letting everyone view this discussion we already have more transparency then every company I've worked for in RL üòÜ 
I thought I would start things off by asking what bottlenecks OOG is facing that newer players could possibly fill? @Shipwright 
I want to start putting buy ads out that target our needs so I can start trading with players in those industries - once I get to know them a bit I'll get an idea of how engaged they are.  From there we can review if they are a fit for OOG and offer them to join the Discord

The first two things that come to mind are Smelting and RAT production - anything else I should be looking for?

When I'm back (sunday) I'll do an inventory of the POPI needs and current suppliers. I've the feeling that we have also some needs in this direction

In general all consumables are shortage right now and can make lot of profit, also C and of course AL.

Specifically for ships, cargo bays and tanks, but that requires ASM and we will be catching up with it soon.

Higher tier consumables are in very short supply, not only in corp but on the CX as well. REP, MED, HHS, FIM, SC, VEG

Do you guys want fancy colors that do not have them already? If so do you want to keep them all the same or each their own?


[25-Aug-22 02:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't need a fancy color, unless we think that would be helpful for new players to know who might be able to help them


[25-Aug-22 02:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Perhaps we should ask players what their demand is for some of those consumables; I know I started producing a couple of them since the supply on the CX was so unreliable.  Then we can match interested players with that demand

Can someone give Dehzhas the 200k starting grant?  We told him about it, so definitely want to make sure he gets the benefit.  I accidentally paid for my ship in full this morning, so I'm down to 300k atm...  Happy to repay whoever has the cash to give him his grant.

going forward, I don't think I've got the revenue yet to fund 200k for anyone who joins, but I'm open to doing 100k myself if someone else wants to match that


[11-Oct-22 11:38 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'll send him a contract üôÇ


[12-Oct-22 06:19 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Allocater got him I believe


[12-Oct-22 09:21 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I arranged mine to be a loan so we got it figured it out


[12-Oct-22 12:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Balling.  Should we keep the grant going for new players?  Doesn't seem like we're getting dozens of them, so it should be pretty affordable
