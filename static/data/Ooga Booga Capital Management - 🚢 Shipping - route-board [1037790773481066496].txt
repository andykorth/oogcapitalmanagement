Harmonia <-> ANT <-> Nike - Although I can make a stop at any of the planets in between those 3 if the creds are good.


[11-Nov-22 02:49 AM] gladeowl#0000
ANT << >> Nike (500/500)
Both of my ships are just switching places between the two, and my own shipping is pretty much non-existent.


[11-Nov-22 02:55 AM] allocater#0000
there is always LST to ship, you could build up 1000+ to fill the ships


[11-Nov-22 07:19 PM] optitronic#0000
I have tons of LST you can take to Ant lol. I'll put up some contracts.


[22-Dec-22 10:47 AM] gladeowl#0000
I'll often have stuff for the Harmonia >> ANT stretch.


[22-Dec-22 10:48 AM] churavis#0000
I've always got goods to go from Harmonia to Norwick


[22-Dec-22 11:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I would have stuff for that as well; not sure if you're talking about doing this frequently or one-off


[22-Dec-22 11:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I assume it wouldn't be in route board if it was a one time thing!

Hey all. Just to tell that i do transport 2000/2000, 3000/1000 and 1000/3000 from any CX to any CX for 30k (or more if too urgent) or 50/60 Ant-Mor as double time needed. I read all CX LM boards for shipping ads.  I always  have some ships available üôÇ . You can contr me directly too as mostly do.  I am quiet busy with tons of contracts but corp ones will be priority if any üôÇ

**Free transport line **
- `ZV-194(a-h)` <->`ZV-194(a-h)`      `WCB`

Service promise: after accept it will deliver in a day


[10-Jan-25 05:05 AM] bookliko#0000
Reliable 48 h round trip with 3000t/1000m3 to the following routes:
Deimos <-> ANT <-> Nike
Harmonia <-> ANT <-> ISA
Let me know if you have specific requests or timing queries. 
Customer determines the price. (Any LM adds I see, and fit, I take along).
