[16-Jun-21 09:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
avg 71, whatever price you agree on, Figaro will transfer that to me, and then Insnesless makes the sell offer on Deimos and I accept it, and depart to Phobos with it.


[16-Jun-21 09:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Figaro, there is also this on the Deimos LM. I will ship them for you in the same trip if you want anything

[16-Jun-21 10:37 PM] figaro0714#0000
I'll get back to you in an hour


[16-Jun-21 11:27 PM] insensless72#0000
Im stockpiling rn, I only have 110 rn but ill sell that to you. I usually post @ 70 on the market but could go lower than that


[17-Jun-21 12:09 AM] figaro0714#0000
Can u do @65 and I'll take all u got?


[17-Jun-21 12:18 AM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape thanks for the info, but looks to expensive.


[17-Jun-21 12:19 AM] figaro0714#0000
I'll buy the carbon from you when u got it available


[17-Jun-21 12:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea idc about those other deimos LM offers.


[17-Jun-21 12:41 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
20 C in 20 hours


[17-Jun-21 12:46 AM] insensless72#0000
yup that works for me


[17-Jun-21 12:46 AM] insensless72#0000
You want to send a ship to me or vise versa?


[17-Jun-21 12:49 AM] insensless72#0000
People on Deimos or even off Deimos will bring it and mark it up for "the lazies" so keep that in mind. I rarely use the LM for much here. Phobos LM you can usually find some good deals


[17-Jun-21 01:08 AM] figaro0714#0000
DLR says he'll be doing the shipping. How should i transfer the cash?


[17-Jun-21 01:09 AM] insensless72#0000
Ill post a selling ad and you accept. Then you post a shipping and and he brings it back?


[17-Jun-21 01:10 AM] figaro0714#0000
"Figaro will transfer that to me, and then Insnesless makes the sell offer on Deimos and I accept it, and depart to Phobos with it" that was his plan


[17-Jun-21 01:10 AM] insensless72#0000
okay cool cause I havent done it that way before


[17-Jun-21 01:12 AM] figaro0714#0000
Me neither, idk how the transfer will work. But lmk the total price @65/u when ur ready


[17-Jun-21 01:12 AM] insensless72#0000
7k flat


[17-Jun-21 01:13 AM] figaro0714#0000
110 ALO?


[17-Jun-21 01:13 AM] insensless72#0000
Yup! unless it happens after my EXT produce more ALO then Ill have more to offer


[17-Jun-21 01:14 AM] insensless72#0000
it would be 180 if you want in that case


[17-Jun-21 01:15 AM] figaro0714#0000
110 will due for now. Just gotta wait for DLR now


[17-Jun-21 01:15 AM] insensless72#0000
sounds good


[17-Jun-21 10:47 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 i am ready to sell you 1 RAT for 7k


[17-Jun-21 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@insensless72 @megasaberexe there is a ship waiting on Deimos if you want to ship anything from Deimos -> Phobos.


[26-Jun-21 10:42 PM] insensless72#0000
Thanks man but no one is buying anything rn on Phobos and I can't post ads


[26-Jun-21 10:46 PM] insensless72#0000
Wait let me give you the BTA you want to arrange that?


[27-Jun-21 05:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea we should do that. There is no rush to ship anything from Deimos so it is not time sensitive


[27-Jun-21 05:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if Earthling or Figaro wanted to buy excess ALO from you we could get it in the same flight


[28-Jun-21 10:38 AM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm still just producing agriculture stuff, thanks for the offer though.


[28-Jun-21 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That was for Insnesless. keep it up with the FRM -> FP plan


[01-Jul-21 03:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger roger


[05-Jul-21 08:26 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Anyone on based on Deimos besides Insenseless? Anyone need any RAT/DW?


[05-Jul-21 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe If you bought DW instead of make it yourself you could avoid buying multiple RIGs


[05-Jul-21 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Much more H2O efficient to make rations and RCO and such


[05-Jul-21 08:41 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  Just bought stuff to build a FP, starting to mass produce DW and rations. Thanks for the advice DLR.


[05-Jul-21 08:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats good news!


[05-Jul-21 08:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On phobos I find myself buying H2O to keep things running even though I have 2 rigs


[06-Jul-21 12:38 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yea I kinda did the math too, I might need to build a 2nd rig and focus on building another habitat which is probably going to be super expensive.


[06-Jul-21 01:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
RIG is expensive, if you use the H2O on FRM it is profitable. Not profitable to go RIG -> DW on deimos but some amount of DW is a necessity


[11-Jul-21 03:01 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, i'll keep that in mind


[14-Jul-21 05:28 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Who should i vote for on deimos? @bitcoin_ape


[14-Jul-21 05:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
who are the options? madnewmy and somebody else?

[14-Jul-21 05:31 PM] megasaberexe#0000
should i ask for bribes or something?


[14-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
o snap


[14-Jul-21 05:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I prefer slomes. He did not have my favor as governor of phobos, but thats because the dude only had a base on deimos and was using phobos tax to pump his home planet


[14-Jul-21 05:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I consider fio corp to be outside power. they try their best to build power and influence in Antares but Slomes and ANTs are actual local players


[14-Jul-21 05:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with that said, ask him for a bribe anyways. Dude is rich.


[14-Jul-21 05:34 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Lolz will do, i'll ask slomes to give us a favor or something for my vote.


[14-Jul-21 05:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nah dont say ‚Äúus‚Äù because he will come to me haha


[14-Jul-21 05:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
just say you personally want a bribe


[14-Jul-21 05:36 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay, roger that


[15-Jul-21 05:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
The deal is in the bag.


[15-Jul-21 05:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
how much AIC does a vote cost these days?


[17-Jul-21 09:23 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe You're agriculture on Deimos right? How do you feel about expanding into C?


[17-Jul-21 09:24 PM] insensless72#0000
I would give you everything you need to build a INC in exchange for your first batches of Carbon


[17-Jul-21 10:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  That would be great. But I'm using 170/200 of my pop limit. But i can just deconstruct my FP or i can keep my FP and buy the materials for a 3rd HB1. @bitcoin_ape  What do you think?


[18-Jul-21 05:29 AM] insensless72#0000
Definitely save up for a 3rd HB1 especially since you're producing your own consumables. I'll hold onto enough materials to build you an INC so that when the time comes you can throw up a HB1 and an INC at the same time.


[18-Jul-21 05:29 AM] insensless72#0000
People (like me) would go crazy for a local source of C on Deimos


[18-Jul-21 08:11 AM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Roger that, also i see your selling 2 BBH on the local market. Can i buy them? I need 4 of them for the HB1 but 2 is better then none.


[18-Jul-21 10:01 AM] insensless72#0000
I'm not next to my cpu rn but sure snag them. Make sure it's BBH cause I meant to post LDE. If I messed up and posted BBH I have them in my inv to sell to you. Alternatively I can sell you the 4 BBH you need later on yoday


[18-Jul-21 10:15 AM] megasaberexe#0000
That sounds great, but i don't have the money to buy the other 2 yet but will soon.


[18-Jul-21 10:20 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh shoot, i don't have pro so my rating is U. Can you switch to U?


[18-Jul-21 10:22 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh wait i see, you  can't. Just check. Shoot, well i'll buy PRO one of these days hopefully.


[18-Jul-21 10:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you buy 1 month of pro you get permanent access to local markets, even when pro expires you still get to accept offers


[18-Jul-21 10:38 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Hmmmmmmm, I'll have to think about it. Trying to save IRL money because you know life.


[18-Jul-21 10:58 AM] megasaberexe#0000
It says my card does not support this type of purchase. Is it because I'm in the USA and the payment is going to the UK?


[18-Jul-21 11:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i used paypal


[18-Jul-21 11:02 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they handle the currency exchange and stuff and put the charge on your us credit card


[18-Jul-21 11:02 AM] megasaberexe#0000
I see i see


[18-Jul-21 11:22 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Yea my bank decline to be added to PayPal, I'll probably have to contact them later or something


[19-Jul-21 05:25 PM] megasaberexe#0000
If i buy pro, i know i'll get the rating but after it expires i don't think i can access the local market anymore. I don't think i can do a continuous monthly subscription..... I'm i correct on the local market thing?


[19-Jul-21 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe when your "PRO" license expires, you will revert to "BASIC" and retain your company rating


[19-Jul-21 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BASIC is better than TRIAL which is what you currently have. As a BASIC license player, you will be able to accept local market offers, but not create your own offers


[19-Jul-21 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PRO license can create and accept offers


[19-Jul-21 06:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 in ~36 hours we will have 60 SEA, 200 MCG, and roughly 400 PG to ship to Deimos


[19-Jul-21 06:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see i see, thats good news. I'll get the 1 month pro option then.


[19-Jul-21 07:01 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  is the subscription autopay?


[19-Jul-21 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont think so.


[19-Jul-21 07:02 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay, thanks for the info.


[19-Jul-21 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe you can choose autopay but I dont think mine is auto-renewing on me


[19-Jul-21 07:03 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay, i'll probably look into it anyway.


[20-Jul-21 02:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe keep us updated! It would be awesome to have carbon on deimos


[20-Jul-21 06:10 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sorry about that, i have to wait until friday to contact my credit card customer service to remove the international restrictions so that i can buy PRO. This friday is a optional work day for me so i decide to not take it, which will allow me to contact them before they close which is what happen to me today.


[20-Jul-21 06:10 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape


[20-Jul-21 06:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ooh i see. Yea that is busted that they dont let you use paypal


[20-Jul-21 06:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sorry for the headache haha


[20-Jul-21 06:13 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Nah it's cool, I'll get it eventually! üòé


[23-Jul-21 01:41 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape @insensless72 I now have PRO


[26-Jul-21 08:13 PM] insensless72#0000

[28-Jul-21 07:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe are you making carbon now?


[28-Jul-21 07:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also @insensless72 how is the 2 base operations going?


[29-Jul-21 05:21 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  Yes, my first 55 C will go to Insensless which was a part of my deal with them. I'm selling my C after that at a price of 240 AIC which i will never increase. I could go cheaper but i would probably need financial or material help to build the production infrastructure.


[29-Jul-21 05:46 PM] insensless72#0000
2nd base is good, I have 2 EXT up and my first batch of LST is already out


[29-Jul-21 05:46 PM] insensless72#0000
I can only carry 183 per ship


[29-Jul-21 05:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nice nice


[29-Jul-21 05:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Did you contact Earthling about the delivery?


[29-Jul-21 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea it will be picked up whenever you arrive


[29-Jul-21 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also i have 6 carbon still chilling on deimos if you want to buy it


[29-Jul-21 05:49 PM] insensless72#0000
Have Earthing put up a buy offer tonight, itll be there in 12 hrs. 150 @ 1


[29-Jul-21 05:50 PM] insensless72#0000
What would 5 be?


[29-Jul-21 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
250 each lately. honestly just wait until you want to buy all 6


[29-Jul-21 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
less taxes that way


[29-Jul-21 05:51 PM] insensless72#0000
I biy in groups of 5 cause thats how the stacks work in production


[29-Jul-21 05:52 PM] insensless72#0000
ill take the 5 off you now if you wnat


[29-Jul-21 05:52 PM] insensless72#0000

[29-Jul-21 05:53 PM] insensless72#0000
FINE


[29-Jul-21 05:53 PM] insensless72#0000

[01-Aug-21 12:45 PM] sempyrfi#0000
@everyoneAnyone have 4 BSE?


[02-Aug-21 05:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sorry my BSE are for reserves. Don't worry you'll be able to get enough money for them eventually.


[02-Aug-21 06:13 PM] insensless72#0000
I do @sempyrfi however it might be more efficient to get them off market. I say that due to fuel cost


[05-Aug-21 05:46 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm voting for slomes, but i think he is going to win anyway. But can i ask anyone on deimos to hold their vote or to vote for slomes?


[05-Aug-21 05:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
dont vote yet


[05-Aug-21 05:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
let it play out for a few days

[06-Aug-21 03:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If anyone on Deimos wants MCG, I can sell @16/u.


[07-Aug-21 04:57 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Anyone going to CX any time soon?


[07-Aug-21 05:31 PM] insensless72#0000

[07-Aug-21 09:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Time to export* FLX to Deimos I suppose (I always mix up import/export)


[12-Aug-21 05:49 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  Hey Insensless, I have given you 48 C as of right now. I still owe you 7. Right now I have 16, so 16-7=9. Can you buy the 9 C off of me? The price was 240 per C, so 240 x 9 = 2160. I don't want to go to CX right now because i still have supplies. If you can't, then that is okay.


[12-Aug-21 05:50 PM] insensless72#0000
Absolutely


[12-Aug-21 05:50 PM] insensless72#0000
Give me an hour to get home


[12-Aug-21 05:56 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Cool, I'll be here


[12-Aug-21 06:12 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe I'm home, can you post or do you need me to?


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  I can post


[12-Aug-21 06:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Ready when you are, bump it up to 2400 so i can absorb the ad fees


[12-Aug-21 06:18 PM] megasaberexe#0000
oh wait my bad


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] insensless72#0000
If for some reason someone accepts that offer lmk and ill buy that C off you as well


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] megasaberexe#0000
how do I cancel?


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] insensless72#0000

[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] insensless72#0000

[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] insensless72#0000
damn I wish I knew that a while ago


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you can put LMOS in an empty buffer or click it at the top of the LM screen


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Done


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
fyi CXOS is the same thing but for the CX market


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] insensless72#0000
Thanks! Ill take C off your hands at any time, just keep me posted


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger that, also thanks DLR.


[18-Aug-21 09:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe @insensless72 I will need one of you to help me make a trade on Deimos LM with your PRO account


[18-Aug-21 09:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alucard998 has 60+ AL that I want to buy, but he doesnt have pro. So I need you to make a contract with me to accept the payment, and then make a contract with Alucard to buy the AL from him.


[18-Aug-21 09:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On the contract with me I will include the tax for the 2 LM orders


[19-Aug-21 06:58 AM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape Today is going to be pretty busy for me, do you have an estimated time I could shoot for?

@insensless72 just let me know when you have 5 minutes and I will hop online and tell you what contracts to make


[19-Aug-21 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can leave one of them hanging for alucard. If somebody else sells at the same price im happy


[19-Aug-21 03:26 PM] insensless72#0000
It'll be at least 8 tonight before I get home


[19-Aug-21 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Just tell me what to do


[19-Aug-21 06:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe thanks for your help making that deal happen. @insensless72 your PRO services are no longer needed on Deimos.


[19-Aug-21 06:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks for being available though. We will keep you in the corp... for now...


[19-Aug-21 06:38 PM] insensless72#0000

There is room for basic license accounts to make money on LMs, especially through accepting shipping contracts.

@insensless72 @megasaberexe Is either of you going to CX any time soon? I still have MCG lying on Deimos, and now would be a great time to sell it. I have just shy of 174t of MCG on the planet, and I'll pay 1k for shipping the whole lot to CX. Alternatively I can sell it to you at bulk price and leave them for you to do as you will.


[03-Sep-21 02:01 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano I'm buying some MCG and BBH from Insensless for my repair and I'm on basic now. I think Insensless will probably take it because I needed some of his I think and he also travels a lot because he has two bases I think.......


[03-Sep-21 02:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  Also I have 56 C, maybe instead of paying money I can give you C. But if you want to do it via currency then that is also okay.


[03-Sep-21 03:43 PM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano How much is your bulk rate and what does 174t equal out to in units?


[03-Sep-21 03:43 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Exchanging C for your fabs and MCG is fine with me


[03-Sep-21 03:50 PM] spatial_piano#0000
724 units. I'm thinking 11k for the whole batch, which comes to about 15.19/u


[03-Sep-21 03:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Okay


[03-Sep-21 03:52 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill take all the MCG off you, ill turn it into LSE


[03-Sep-21 03:52 PM] insensless72#0000
lol nvm


[03-Sep-21 03:52 PM] insensless72#0000
ill still take it though


[03-Sep-21 03:53 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ok. I'm ready to grab the ad.


[03-Sep-21 03:55 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Thank you. that's one pain in the neck gone.


[03-Sep-21 03:56 PM] insensless72#0000
No problem, im building soon so thanks for the good pricew


[03-Sep-21 03:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I've had the batch just lying there for weeks. It takes a lot of effort to sell if you can't post ads, and I don't have time for that.


[03-Sep-21 03:59 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah i feel your pain with the LST


[03-Sep-21 03:59 PM] insensless72#0000
cant post it on Phobos


[03-Sep-21 04:01 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Makes you kinda wonder what is event thew point of having a WAR if you can't sell from it. But I guess it's just for buyers and locals.


[03-Sep-21 04:06 PM] insensless72#0000
It can potentially work really well between corp members. Tadabe is pretty good about keeping consumables on Deimos that I snag as needed. Guaranteed sale


[09-Sep-21 06:27 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@kimmyjiko I want to buy another 30 COF. Are you still selling at the same price?


[09-Sep-21 11:06 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
My current price is 450


[09-Sep-21 11:06 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
I can have 10 out there for you tomorrow but I‚Äôll need a bit longer for the other 20


[10-Sep-21 05:59 PM] megasaberexe#0000
How long for the full 30? I can wait if need be


[10-Sep-21 06:00 PM] insensless72#0000
It'll be around 5 or 6 days


[10-Sep-21 06:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh i see, then yea i can wait


[10-Sep-21 06:30 PM] insensless72#0000
Im working in 34 for Marky now, then a few for Jarhead and some of your batch will be getting ready with his. I'll keep you posted it might be faster than that


[10-Sep-21 07:00 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay so i'll buy 10 from tadabe and 20 from Insensless, I guess that is the plan


[10-Sep-21 08:22 PM] insensless72#0000
Hold up huge miscommunication. I was on my phone and thought this was a direct message. @megasaberexe I don't have any coffee


[10-Sep-21 08:22 PM] insensless72#0000
My apologies


[11-Sep-21 10:39 AM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Oh thats okay


[11-Sep-21 10:40 AM] megasaberexe#0000
@kimmyjiko  I know you only have 10 COF, have you already sent the ship? If yes then I'll just buy the 10 COF, if not then I can wait for the full 30 and then you can send the ship.


[11-Sep-21 01:48 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
I had to send the ship either way so all good


[11-Sep-21 01:48 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
I got your 10, will have another 30 within a week


[11-Sep-21 01:48 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Unless another 20 is good


[11-Sep-21 06:12 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sweet, I'll buy the 10 off you and within a week I also want to buy the other 30 if your willing to sell all of it.


[11-Sep-21 11:31 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Let me know when you‚Äôre good - they‚Äôre on planet


[12-Sep-21 12:26 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay I'm on @kimmyjiko


[12-Sep-21 12:27 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wait I don't have premium anymore


[12-Sep-21 12:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you can still accept offers, as long as tadabe has PRO.


[12-Sep-21 12:31 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right, I just have to wait until they replies i guess.


[12-Sep-21 08:25 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Op


[12-Sep-21 08:25 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
I can put up the ad now


[13-Sep-21 05:56 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sorry was asleep for work, I'm usually on around 5:30 CTZ


[13-Sep-21 06:01 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  When do you think you will need more C?


[13-Sep-21 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
Im sitting on 177 currently, so it might be awhile


[13-Sep-21 06:47 PM] insensless72#0000
Definitely take it to market with the current prices

[16-Sep-21 07:41 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Do you have any BSE for sell? I mean I know your pretty busy with producing stuff for other corps members.


[16-Sep-21 07:42 PM] megasaberexe#0000
oh wait never mind i saw your bse at CX.


[16-Sep-21 07:54 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe That depends on how much you want. Ill have 15 ready in 12hrs but theyre being produced on Nike


[16-Sep-21 07:59 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh i got them now, from you in fact. On CXL, you were selling 15 of them and i bought 9 of them. @insensless72


[21-Sep-21 05:27 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Do you have any C you can sell?


[21-Sep-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  Got 56 C


[29-Sep-21 04:04 PM] insensless72#0000
Im a couple days away from producing 20 STL, let me know if anyone wants to reserve them


[29-Sep-21 07:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 as soon as I get some oxygen and carbon out there, I will start producing FE from 1 smelter on KI-401b


[29-Sep-21 07:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Then I will bring the FE to deimos and phobos. Much better than shipping FEO at 5.9 tonnes/each


[29-Sep-21 08:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds like a solid plan üëç


[29-Sep-21 08:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hmm now that I look at it, it is not much better to ship FE... Its 31 tons vs. 35.4 for one smelter recipe's worth. 6 FEO = 4 FE.


[29-Sep-21 08:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I guess I will go with no FLX to keep things cheap and lightweight.


[29-Sep-21 08:10 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah but the profit from smelting it yourself would probably help make up for the transport vs selling it as ore


[29-Sep-21 08:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
true. Its still going to be fuel savings too


[29-Sep-21 08:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will still do it.


[29-Sep-21 08:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
63 FE on one ship. So sad.


[29-Sep-21 08:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
could be over 30K depending on FE price.


[04-Oct-21 05:31 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Do you have any spare BSE, BBH, and BDE to sell?


[04-Oct-21 05:35 PM] insensless72#0000
I dont have any BDE, but I have BBH and BSE. How many are you looking for?


[04-Oct-21 06:51 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Ill have 17 BSE and 10 BBH in a hour and a half. I need to send a ship back to Deimos anyway, just lmk what you nend and Ill bring it to you


[04-Oct-21 07:47 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  Oh sweet, i need 2 BSE and 2 BBH, i guess you have no BDE but that is fine i have a ship at CX so i can just buy it there. Also do you need any carbon? I have 88 C.


[04-Oct-21 07:54 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Id gladly take the C, and Ill bring that stuff for you, should be within a day or 2


[05-Oct-21 04:54 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe bfabs are on Deimos


[05-Oct-21 05:44 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  I'm ready to do the trade


[06-Oct-21 06:12 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe The extra fabs are on Deimos. I brought 10 each


[06-Oct-21 06:28 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  Okay I'm ready to buy them


[06-Oct-21 06:32 PM] insensless72#0000

[09-Oct-21 12:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 ready


[09-Oct-21 12:57 PM] insensless72#0000
Mega wanted 100 MCG, you brought 600?


[09-Oct-21 12:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes


[09-Oct-21 12:58 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Are you available for a trade?


[09-Oct-21 12:59 PM] insensless72#0000
How much was the MCG ea?


[09-Oct-21 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
16.67


[09-Oct-21 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
fuel cost is a little messy because i made other trades on the same run


[09-Oct-21 01:01 PM] insensless72#0000
Call it 12k for all 600?


[09-Oct-21 01:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea thats fine


[09-Oct-21 01:02 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill get Mega his when hes ready


[09-Oct-21 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have SIO if you want it. otherwise I will sell it to some glass furnace player on the LM here


[09-Oct-21 01:03 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill buy it, hiw much did you bring?


[09-Oct-21 01:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
66


[09-Oct-21 01:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will sell it at 42


[09-Oct-21 01:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
about 2750 AIC


[09-Oct-21 01:06 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72  I'm on and ready to trade, do you want me to setup a AD? If so then what was the price again?


[09-Oct-21 01:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Yup im ready, post a buy for 100 @ 17 ea


[09-Oct-21 01:06 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger that, setting up the AD, 1700 total


[09-Oct-21 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72  Last thing I have is 16 TIO, ill sell it all for 1100 if you want it. Then I will buy the fabs you are holding for me


[09-Oct-21 01:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Im good on the TIO


[09-Oct-21 01:07 PM] insensless72#0000
and the fabs are on Nike..

üòê


[09-Oct-21 01:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Sorry I didnt know I needed to bring them


[09-Oct-21 01:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nah its fine, I can go get them and probably ship LST to phobos in the process


[09-Oct-21 01:09 PM] insensless72#0000
You can do that or I can bring them to you. In 5hrs ill have a ship headed to the CX, I can make a pti stop on Phobos


[09-Oct-21 01:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also I can ship your stuff from deimos -> Nike right now if you have anything


[09-Oct-21 01:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on the way over, my ship is empty rn


[09-Oct-21 01:10 PM] insensless72#0000
That would be fantasitc


[09-Oct-21 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think its best for me to burn some fuel and get these fabs quicker


[09-Oct-21 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so yea load me up with free shipments haha


[09-Oct-21 01:11 PM] insensless72#0000
What do you want for payment?


[09-Oct-21 01:11 PM] insensless72#0000
its usually around 120 SF and 10 FF if you drop the FF all the way


[09-Oct-21 01:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea thats about right, roughly 3K


[09-Oct-21 01:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but I will end up making money from LST


[09-Oct-21 01:12 PM] insensless72#0000
Im posting 3 shipments in total


[09-Oct-21 01:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok ready to accept


[09-Oct-21 01:15 PM] insensless72#0000
Want me to post the ad for your fabs?


[09-Oct-21 01:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea sure. Do you still have the LDE? I forget what price we had for htem


[09-Oct-21 01:16 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah the LDE was 4k ea


[09-Oct-21 01:16 PM] insensless72#0000
48k for the 12, what else did you need?


[09-Oct-21 01:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Lol I still cant afford them


[09-Oct-21 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can spend 36k on fabs and still load up with LST


[09-Oct-21 01:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill post it for 36k then and just hook me up on the next PG run?


[09-Oct-21 01:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
laptop battery died


[09-Oct-21 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i need to buy them now I guess but it will delay my CHP + HB2


[09-Oct-21 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can give you PG later to cover the difference of 12000 AIC


[09-Oct-21 01:21 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds like a plan, posting on Nike


[16-Oct-21 12:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[16-Oct-21 12:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[16-Oct-21 05:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I managed to load 300 ALO for Earthling üôÇ Ship has departed, at least there was value add from the flight instead of just fuel cost


[17-Oct-21 06:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

How much C do you have?


[19-Oct-21 06:23 PM] megasaberexe#0000
128


[19-Oct-21 06:24 PM] megasaberexe#0000
If your full then I'll just go and sell it at CX unless you want me to hold it.


[19-Oct-21 06:24 PM] insensless72#0000
let me get 61 off you


[19-Oct-21 06:25 PM] megasaberexe#0000

Do you want me to hold the rest of the C or should I go and sell it?


[19-Oct-21 06:34 PM] insensless72#0000
Go ahead and sell it


[19-Oct-21 06:34 PM] insensless72#0000
im good for the time being


[19-Oct-21 06:34 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger that


[19-Oct-21 06:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe Earthling might be able to grab the rest of it, the ship is still on deimos


[19-Oct-21 06:58 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  What should I do, just wait and stuff?


[19-Oct-21 07:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
whats your price? we will buy it now


[19-Oct-21 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh i see you did 240 up there. How about 275? still feels wrong (price is so low)


[19-Oct-21 07:08 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I have the INC already paid for by my trades with Insensless, so I'm fine with selling it low.


[19-Oct-21 07:08 PM] megasaberexe#0000
How much does earthling want?>


[19-Oct-21 07:09 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I have 67 C left


[19-Oct-21 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
all 67. posting buy


[21-Oct-21 06:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Have 120 RAT and DW, do you want or should i sell it on CX?


[21-Oct-21 06:13 PM] insensless72#0000
I'll buy it from you when I get home in a few minutes. I'll message you


[21-Oct-21 06:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger that Insensless


[21-Oct-21 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe Im ready when you are


[21-Oct-21 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
120 of both?


[21-Oct-21 06:48 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Just check CX, DW was lowest 38 and RAT was 63 so i'll do 45 for both


[21-Oct-21 06:48 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Do you want me to setup a AD?


[21-Oct-21 06:49 PM] insensless72#0000
yessir, go ahead

[21-Oct-21 06:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
DW is up


[21-Oct-21 06:52 PM] insensless72#0000
Thanks! Im up to 5 SME now burning 25 C every other day. We'll definitely be in touch about your C


[21-Oct-21 06:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Nice doing business with you Insensless, also do you have any BBH and BDE for sell?


[21-Oct-21 06:53 PM] insensless72#0000
No I just sent them all to the CX a couple hours ago. How many are you looking for>


[21-Oct-21 06:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
4 of each


[21-Oct-21 06:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh yea not BDE but BSE, sorry about that


[21-Oct-21 06:54 PM] insensless72#0000
You might as well get them on market as low as the price is rn. If you post .01 above the highest BBH buy offer ill fill it


[21-Oct-21 06:54 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh I see, will do.


[21-Oct-21 06:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Will you have enough H2O for all of that farming?


[21-Oct-21 06:56 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yes, I now have 2 RIGs. Hopefully that will be enough, i've also been saving some up just in case I don't have enough and have time to build another one.


[21-Oct-21 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh 2 rigs will be fine. nice.


[21-Oct-21 06:59 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh yea i need MCG too


[21-Oct-21 07:00 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Do you have MCG for sell Marky?


[21-Oct-21 07:07 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Also both BBH and BSE are up and got the BBH. Do you have any BSE? @insensless72


[21-Oct-21 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Mark probably has MCG but the trick would be getting it off of Phobos


[21-Oct-21 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe he would ship 500t and sell the leftovers into deimos LM


[21-Oct-21 07:10 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm actually heading to ANT, probably do a pickup of my MATs and buy some MCG from marky while I'm at it.


[21-Oct-21 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Do you plan to land on Phobos?


[21-Oct-21 07:13 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh yea I need to land to pick it up from the Local market, hmmmm I could do that. Saw someone selling PWO do there and haven't done the math yet but I could pick that up as well.


[21-Oct-21 07:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I would pay you to complete some shipping contracts.


[21-Oct-21 07:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 246 tonnes to bring from Deimos -> Phobos and then 25-30 tonnes to bring from Phobos -> Deimos


[21-Oct-21 07:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think its roughly 200 SF to land and take off from phobos. so at 10 each thats about 2000 AIC. Id easily pay more than that for these shipments


[21-Oct-21 07:26 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh shoot, I already sent my ship. Dang it and I know that I should have done a notification to everyone on deimos. Sorry about this DLR.


[21-Oct-21 07:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol no worries


[21-Oct-21 07:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will catch the next flight. I just bought a big pile of HAL (salt rocks) from Sea of Dirac and he delivered 3 weeks earlier than I expected him to


[21-Oct-21 07:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I thought I would be asking you about this shipment in November


[21-Oct-21 07:28 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh I see, also wow people are already mining HAL. The universe is certainly moving forward.


[21-Oct-21 07:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea and they will mainly be used for Chlorine which will ultimately build RFABs


[21-Oct-21 07:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lots of advanced buildings popping up. Earthling is very close to building HAL extractors on griffonstone which is the best place around here to get them.

@megasaberexe I have 1083 MCG to sell on Phobos.  I can do @14.95/u on the LM. I'll be mostly available for the next 8 hours to trade, but if I'm offline, you can post the buy and I'll fulfill witihin 24h. Just notify me when the ad is up.


[22-Oct-21 12:48 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[22-Oct-21 12:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
no. DLR makes htat


[22-Oct-21 12:48 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh right, I should have ask him for it. Oh well I guess next time.

I'm going to post the AD, one sec


[22-Oct-21 12:51 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh shoot I can't post a AD because I don't have a base or warehouse, can you post a AD or should I rent a warehouse? I kinda don't want to because I'm not sure if you can cancel the renting.


[22-Oct-21 12:51 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Oh right.


[22-Oct-21 12:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000
how much do you want


[22-Oct-21 12:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[22-Oct-21 12:55 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Likewise


[24-Oct-21 11:43 AM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape When you buy AL and ALO outside of corp how much do you buy at a time and how often?


[24-Oct-21 01:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Let me check my old contracts


[24-Oct-21 02:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
10 days ago earthling bought 300 ALO @75.3 each


[24-Oct-21 02:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and then 8 days before that (18 days ago) earthling also bought 31 AL and 200 ALO on the CX. We cant find the prices on that one


[24-Oct-21 02:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
about 30 days ago we also bought 300 ALO at around 100 each


[24-Oct-21 02:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this has resulted in a bit of an overstock of ALO on phobos, so it doesnt get used as fast as it has been bought up over this time period

@insensless72 this is also not including the ALO usage from @figaro0714


[24-Oct-21 03:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He is smelting AL on phobos too for the vertical PP2 production


[26-Oct-21 06:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Do you have another shipment of MATs coming to deimos any time soon?


[26-Oct-21 06:36 PM] insensless72#0000

[26-Oct-21 06:38 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Don't need MCG, and you don't make BTA right?


[26-Oct-21 06:38 PM] insensless72#0000
I have been recently, I can get you everything you need, including the MCG


[26-Oct-21 06:39 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm good on MCG, is it possible to get twice what i need?


[26-Oct-21 06:39 PM] insensless72#0000
Not a problem


[26-Oct-21 06:40 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sweet, when do you think the timeframe would be?


[26-Oct-21 06:41 PM] insensless72#0000
Id say 2 days max


[26-Oct-21 06:42 PM] insensless72#0000
4 BSE
4 BBH
2 BTA
2 BDE
just making sure thats right?


[26-Oct-21 06:44 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yes that is the correct amount. So total would be around 13000 AIC right?


[26-Oct-21 07:03 PM] insensless72#0000
11k flat


[26-Oct-21 07:03 PM] insensless72#0000
How much C do you have?


[26-Oct-21 07:05 PM] megasaberexe#0000
56 C, by tomorrow 64 C


[26-Oct-21 07:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Can I take 60 of that off your hands/


[26-Oct-21 07:06 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Sure, so tomorrow I give 60 C or do you want to setup a AD for 60 and I can give you what I have right now. Oh yea i can setup the AD if you want.


[26-Oct-21 07:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Set up the sell ad, ill go ahead and fill my end and when the C is ready you can fill it


[26-Oct-21 07:07 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Roger that, selling 60 for 1 AIC right?


[26-Oct-21 07:08 PM] insensless72#0000
no


[26-Oct-21 07:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets just do everything at face value, helps me keep my numbers straight lol


[26-Oct-21 07:09 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh right right, sorry about that. I'm still selling my C at 240. 240x60 is 14,400. 14400-11000=3400


[26-Oct-21 07:10 PM] insensless72#0000
Sweet, ill post the buy offer on Deimos


[26-Oct-21 07:11 PM] megasaberexe#0000

Also it won't let my fill it, do i need the full 60???? I thought you could give what you have at the moment......


[26-Oct-21 07:13 PM] insensless72#0000
No you have to have the full 60, but its a 3 day contract so you have plenty of time


[26-Oct-21 07:13 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right, I guess I'll fill it tomorrow then.

@megasaberexe How much C do you have?


[03-Nov-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Sorry for the late reply, I have 64 C.


[03-Nov-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Can setup AD if need be.


[03-Nov-21 06:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds good, let me get 60 from you


[03-Nov-21 06:08 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay 60 C x 240 = 14400 AIC, Are you ready for the AD @insensless72


[03-Nov-21 06:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Yup go ahead


[03-Nov-21 06:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Thanks!


[03-Nov-21 06:09 PM] megasaberexe#0000
That was quick, you too.


[03-Nov-21 06:10 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Also how free is your production Insensless? I'm thinking of building a glass thing


[03-Nov-21 06:11 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Glass Furnace I mean


[03-Nov-21 06:12 PM] insensless72#0000
Im actually making LSE and LBH currently


[03-Nov-21 06:17 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh sweet, I'm still thinking about it and how to setup a stable supply chain to run it, but i'll hopefully have things figure out by this friday. Thanks for telling, when do you think you could produce them?


[03-Nov-21 07:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe GF would consume about 15 SIO per 10 days at 100% efficiency.

If you had it running at 80% eff., it would need 12 SIO in 10 days.  SIO usually trades at 40-50 AIC each.


[03-Nov-21 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the settler consumables would end up being more expensive than the SIO.


[04-Nov-21 06:20 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right, consumables still cut into profits. Also I look on CX and saw earthling selling some Glass, so i guess he already has a GF. I'm not sure if I want one or if the corps even needs another GF person.


[04-Nov-21 06:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea earthling has one GF on phobos


[04-Nov-21 06:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it all goes straight to CX though. When i recommended GF to you I was thinking of low cost ways to get into settler tech and benefit from the metallurgy boost on deimos


[04-Nov-21 06:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in terms of what the corp needs most from Deimos I think it will be refined AL.


[04-Nov-21 06:28 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right right, I'll give some more thought into it and stuff. But all in all since I still have 70 space for pioneers so getting a extractor or smelter is probably best.


[04-Nov-21 06:31 PM] insensless72#0000
Thats my setup on Deimos Mega and theres plenty of room in that market. You could sell the AL itself or build something that requires AL for a more refined product


[04-Nov-21 06:31 PM] insensless72#0000
you would be able to sell or produce cheaper than most since you already produce your own C

[11-Nov-21 05:54 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, when I get to CX I'll contact them


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Do you have 30 OVE and 30 PWO that I can buy from you? Also what would be the total?


[11-Nov-21 11:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@megasaberexe On Phobos, Nike and CX I do have those.The prices are 52/u and 132/u and I can do those on planets. Total would be 1560 + 3960 = 5520.  On CX you can't trade directly so the price has to at the top of the request list. Top requests on CX are 55.5 and 121.25 so If we trade there you can bid for example 56/u and 128/u since you are buying equal amounts. I'll be away for the next 8-10 hours.


[12-Nov-21 12:59 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Can I come down to phobos and pick them up? I kinda didn't look at my supply count and I need them urgently. If not then that is okay.

@megasaberexe If you're coming down to Phobos, would you like some SF as well? I can sell up to 1000 SF @8.4/u


[12-Nov-21 01:51 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh shoot, I forgot you sell SF too....... Eh I probably should pick up some anyway. I'll take 600 @spatial_piano


[12-Nov-21 01:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000

Also you don't need RAT and DW right now right? So I can just go and sell those right?


[15-Nov-21 05:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PT and EXO get used pretty slowly compared to other consumables.


[15-Nov-21 05:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yeah I only need 0.4 per day


[15-Nov-21 05:56 PM] insensless72#0000
You can take as many as you want. I have 90 currently


[15-Nov-21 05:56 PM] insensless72#0000
And no I'm good on RAT and DW you can sell those


[15-Nov-21 05:56 PM] insensless72#0000

[15-Nov-21 05:57 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[15-Nov-21 06:03 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh snap, nice timing. I need 2 BSE 2 BBH 1 BTA 1 BDE and 100 MCG. If you can't get everything then that is fine, anything will help. Do you want me to post the ADs or send me the bill later?


[15-Nov-21 06:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets figure out the ads tomorrow, I have all of that so itll be on its way probably tomorrow evening


[15-Nov-21 06:05 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay sweet, I'll be there

Roger that


[16-Nov-21 05:11 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Lets do the total on one order and then the rest as 1


[16-Nov-21 05:12 PM] insensless72#0000
Itll be easier for me to do it individually


[16-Nov-21 05:12 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay, please give me the prices


[16-Nov-21 05:12 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh I see


[16-Nov-21 05:12 PM] insensless72#0000

[16-Nov-21 05:13 PM] insensless72#0000

Yep, posting now


[16-Nov-21 05:14 PM] megasaberexe#0000
For each or both?


[16-Nov-21 05:14 PM] insensless72#0000
Both


[16-Nov-21 05:14 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh okay cool


[16-Nov-21 05:16 PM] megasaberexe#0000
What about the BSE?


[16-Nov-21 05:19 PM] insensless72#0000
I posted that first, did someone else take it?


[16-Nov-21 05:19 PM] megasaberexe#0000
No I accepted it, but it's not complete. Check your CONT


[16-Nov-21 05:22 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I can post a photo if needed

Nice work, also thanks for again getting everything so fast üëç


[16-Nov-21 05:31 PM] insensless72#0000
No problem!


[22-Nov-21 05:45 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Do you make any EXOs?


[22-Nov-21 05:47 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I don't have AL right now, but I can sell about 20.


[22-Nov-21 05:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
How much for total or each?


[22-Nov-21 05:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000
108


[22-Nov-21 05:54 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh shoot actually I probably won't need them for right now. But they seem to be at a great price. Will you still have them in 2 weeks?


[22-Nov-21 05:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can make more in that time.


[22-Nov-21 05:55 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay sweet, lets talk again by then


[30-Nov-21 05:47 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano I know this is a little early but I need 30 PT


[30-Nov-21 05:51 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@insensless72 Do you need C or should I sell it?


[30-Nov-21 05:53 PM] insensless72#0000
I have 100 PT on Deimos 200es. How many do you need?


[30-Nov-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
30 PT


[30-Nov-21 05:54 PM] megasaberexe#0000
So 6000 total? I can post AD if you want


[30-Nov-21 05:55 PM] insensless72#0000
Yup, go for it


[30-Nov-21 05:57 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm low on PT, and I don't really have enough to sell. I have materials for EXO now, so if you need those I can sell.


[30-Nov-21 06:12 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Oh sweet, what is your price for each? EXO i mean


[30-Nov-21 06:13 PM] spatial_piano#0000
106/u


[30-Nov-21 06:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can sell 30 now, or put some more on the queue


[30-Nov-21 06:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wow great price, I'll buy the full 30


[30-Nov-21 06:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I have the phobos LM thing up, so if you post a AD then I'll pick it up


[30-Nov-21 06:16 PM] spatial_piano#0000
up


[30-Nov-21 06:17 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Got it, I'll be there in 2 days-ish


[30-Nov-21 06:22 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano  The PT deal has a deadline in 23 hrs. I don't think I'll be able to make it.......


[30-Nov-21 06:22 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Nothing will happen to it right?


[30-Nov-21 06:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll extend it day after tomorrow.


[30-Nov-21 06:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
But give me a reminder just to make sure.


[30-Nov-21 06:24 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wait, can I buy a warehouse and put it in there?


[30-Nov-21 06:24 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Because I don't want our rep getting hurt


[30-Nov-21 06:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sure yeah that works


[30-Nov-21 06:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If I extend there shouldn't be any rep hit


[30-Nov-21 06:25 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh I see, just did it but that is good to know. How do you do though? Does it just say that the deadline is up and then you can extend it?


[30-Nov-21 06:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, I think so. Basically when the deadline hits the "offended party" has 24 hours to extend


[30-Nov-21 06:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
You can only extend for 24 hours at the time, and have to keep making extensions until the deal is done, or just break.


[30-Nov-21 06:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I had one broken deal, because i missed the deadline, and the other guy couldn't be bothered to communicate, when I asked for extension.


[30-Nov-21 06:29 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It didn't hit my rep tho, so i think it probably compares the amount of successful contracts to broken ones


[30-Nov-21 06:30 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh that is cool to know, anyways thanks for the EXO. Nice doing business with you Markyü§ù


[30-Nov-21 06:30 PM] spatial_piano#0000
NP


[01-Dec-21 06:09 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano Hey Marky, I remember you said that you make PWO. How much for 40?


[01-Dec-21 06:10 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Also do you make FF?


[01-Dec-21 06:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
PWO is 120/u. I don't  have enough HE3 to produce FF for sale.


[01-Dec-21 06:16 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see okay, so total for the PWO is 4800 AIC for 40 right? I'm ready for the AD


[01-Dec-21 06:16 PM] spatial_piano#0000
up


[01-Dec-21 06:17 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Got it, thanks again


[02-Dec-21 08:28 PM] sackless_jack#0000
anyone need anything transported from Deimos to Antares station? Gunna head out to pick up supplies


[02-Dec-21 08:38 PM] insensless72#0000
@sackless_jack I do, how much space do you have?


[02-Dec-21 08:40 PM] sackless_jack#0000
all the space! I need to pick up drinking water, rations and overalls


[02-Dec-21 08:40 PM] sackless_jack#0000
also @insensless72 I have some Carbon for you


[02-Dec-21 08:41 PM] insensless72#0000
Im going to post a shipping ad, how much C?


[02-Dec-21 08:42 PM] sackless_jack#0000
40 C


[02-Dec-21 08:43 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill buy it from you, what do you want ea?


[02-Dec-21 08:50 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I'm not sure about that. I owe you around 29k AIC for the prefabs right? But I need AIC for supplies. What do you think about half market price?


[02-Dec-21 08:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Market price for carbon is low right now. You should go close to it or you would end up losing money.


[02-Dec-21 08:52 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Good idea


[02-Dec-21 08:52 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Hey @insensless72 Will I be selling you the Carbon directly on Deimos?


[02-Dec-21 08:59 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes you will, how about 300ea for C to help out with your supplies and we'll worry about the fab cost later


[02-Dec-21 09:01 PM] insensless72#0000
Btw the fabs are on their way to Deimos, 10hrs out. We can do the ads for those tomorrow


[02-Dec-21 09:01 PM] sackless_jack#0000
300 each is generous! You keep being so nice to me >.<


[02-Dec-21 09:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Get that foundation under you, thats whats important early game. I did the same for Mega


[02-Dec-21 09:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Go ahead and post sell offer


[02-Dec-21 09:10 PM] sackless_jack#0000
ok! Thank you!


[02-Dec-21 09:14 PM] insensless72#0000
Np! ill message you tomorrow about the fabs


[02-Dec-21 09:14 PM] insensless72#0000
Thanks for the shipping


[02-Dec-21 09:14 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Thanks again! and NP anytime!


[03-Dec-21 05:01 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe @sackless_jack I have your fabs on Deimos


[03-Dec-21 05:37 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Hey @insensless72  
Great, Let the construction begin!


[03-Dec-21 05:39 PM] insensless72#0000
If you want to go ahead and post the buy offers I'll fill them


[03-Dec-21 05:46 PM] sackless_jack#0000
So I am going to be setting up a smelter and extractor right? that is what you recommend?


[03-Dec-21 05:46 PM] insensless72#0000
Correct


[03-Dec-21 05:46 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets do the trades but dont build them yet


[03-Dec-21 05:47 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Sweet! I'll post a buy contract for the prefabs. Since you are helping me get set up, how much AIC should I put?


[03-Dec-21 05:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Set each buy ad for 1


[03-Dec-21 05:48 PM] sackless_jack#0000
ok


[03-Dec-21 05:48 PM] insensless72#0000
16 BSE AIC @ 1


[03-Dec-21 05:48 PM] insensless72#0000
for example


[03-Dec-21 05:52 PM] sackless_jack#0000
give me a sec, trying to post an ad for MCG. "post" button isn't posting lol


[03-Dec-21 05:52 PM] insensless72#0000
No worries youre fine


[03-Dec-21 05:55 PM] insensless72#0000
If its messign up for you I can post and you can accept


[03-Dec-21 05:56 PM] sackless_jack#0000
let me keep trying. I don't want someone else getting lucky haha


[03-Dec-21 05:58 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I figured it out. Forgot to select a currency >.<


[03-Dec-21 05:58 PM] insensless72#0000

ok that should be everything


[03-Dec-21 06:01 PM] insensless72#0000
If you have the room for workers, go ahead and get that EXT up and running. I would wait until you have ALO to put up the SME


[03-Dec-21 06:09 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Good ideea!


[03-Dec-21 06:10 PM] sackless_jack#0000
ok I'll get the EXT up


[03-Dec-21 06:10 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Looks like I'm at 280/300 workers

@sackless_jack do you have oxygen and flux? O and FLX


[03-Dec-21 07:19 PM] sackless_jack#0000
nope!


[03-Dec-21 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
These are the two ways to smelt ALO:

[03-Dec-21 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
FLX is the best recipe. You should consider picking up these two on your next flight.


[03-Dec-21 07:38 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Will do thanks! It‚Äôs nice to already have the Carbon. Is Oxygen and Flux expensive?


[03-Dec-21 07:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Not really. FLX is less than 100 each and O is usually around 50


[03-Dec-21 07:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lately the O price has spiked but I think this is temporary


[03-Dec-21 07:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I produce FLX on phobos at very low cost. The hardest part would be shipping it to deimos


[03-Dec-21 08:57 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Nice, Looks like I'll need another Pioneer Habitation before I can get the smelter going. But I can produce ALO for a bit while I get that going


[04-Dec-21 11:09 AM] sackless_jack#0000
@insensless72 you available to buy some Carbon?


[04-Dec-21 11:37 AM] sackless_jack#0000
I'm at Nike looking to pick up some Limestone to sell at Antares, then gunna buy more basic supplies for all my workers.  I'll put up an order on Deimos for the same price as before. If you want me to lower it let me know üôÇ


[04-Dec-21 11:41 AM] sackless_jack#0000
Ok it's up. 16 Carbon for 4,800AIC


[04-Dec-21 02:40 PM] insensless72#0000
@sackless_jack I picked up your LM ad for the C. Also, if you want LST I have plenty


[04-Dec-21 02:40 PM] insensless72#0000
on Nike


[04-Dec-21 02:58 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Awesome thanks! @bitcoin_ape recommended buying LST on Nike and selling on Antares station, so I was gunna do that. If you wanted to sell some to me I‚Äôll be home in like 20-30 min I think


[04-Dec-21 03:09 PM] insensless72#0000
For sure, lmk when you're ready. Are you flying with anything other than LST?

also I can transfer SIO to you somehow during this process. To help with production of GL.


[05-Dec-21 06:58 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I do @bitcoin_ape, I currently have 40 GL. I'm still trying to get all my supplies and things in order. I think trading on deimos would be for the best

yes, I'd take that, thank you

@kharadan @sackless_jack ship arriving in 3 hours with the BFABs, LST and SIO


[17-Jan-22 11:31 AM] kharadan#0000
I'd be interested mainly in the LST
I have some stockpile of PE if you're interested


[17-Jan-22 11:32 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am coming to pick up 500t of AL


[17-Jan-22 11:32 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe a tiny bit of PE will fit

[17-Jan-22 11:36 AM] kharadan#0000
alright, stupid question: how do you set prices for intracorp deals?


[17-Jan-22 11:36 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
case by case basis.


[17-Jan-22 11:36 AM] insensless72#0000
Typically we take the lowest offer rate on market and drop it around 10%


[17-Jan-22 11:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sometimes we fix prices, sometimes we do the above


[17-Jan-22 11:37 AM] domicius#0000
I normally do 30% üòÑ


[17-Jan-22 11:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
fixing prices everywhere is tedious


[17-Jan-22 11:43 AM] kharadan#0000
so for the PE, would 3.8 a piece be alright?


[17-Jan-22 11:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
would you profit at 4 each?


[17-Jan-22 11:44 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that seems like a low price to me


[17-Jan-22 11:45 AM] kharadan#0000
just raw materials are 2.1 AIC for 1 PE, so there is some buffer


[17-Jan-22 11:47 AM] insensless72#0000
Ill gladly take it from you at 4.2


[17-Jan-22 11:47 AM] kharadan#0000
I won't say no to that

@figaro0714 you might be on deimos at the right time for this stuff, i still have that 71 AL for your, but thats about 38% of a shipload

@bitcoin_ape i have a warehouse on deimos i can use to pick up this stuff. But i have enough AL for now

@namthorn I will buy the glass and iron


[18-Jan-22 03:15 PM] namthorn#0000
sure, pop a buy up, is 150/u for the GL and 300/u for the FE good for you?

@artokun I have been buying AL at 300 on Deimos


[18-Jan-22 03:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

that's what I have been selling it at


[18-Jan-22 06:45 PM] artokun#0000
qq, someone on deimos just posted that they are doing RAT and DW in Deimos, isn't that a bad idea?
are the shipping costs that high?


[18-Jan-22 06:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its possible but lower efficiency than harmonia


[18-Jan-22 06:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
same with phobos


[18-Jan-22 07:00 PM] namthorn#0000
i wouldn't go for a large rat/dw base here but if you're just starting out you can make it work with the starter buildings. albeit slower than harmonia. Would be better to do a quick transition into something more suitable though like AL smelting imo.


[18-Jan-22 07:00 PM] namthorn#0000
the % gains of a CoGC and fertility hit a lot harder the more you can produce


[19-Jan-22 03:19 AM] domicius#0000
People seem to think that you should only do the most efficient thing... But economic theory says you should do the most efficient thing compared to your trade partners! Also, with the price of some commodities, the payback for yourself can be high even from suboptimal production. At least until you maximise you own efficiencies!


[19-Jan-22 04:56 AM] namthorn#0000
I don't disagree with that premise but with an economy of scale  you can easily get out-competed by larger, more efficient operations based elsewhere that can afford a lower margin due to the sheer volume of goods they pump out, even factoring in shipping costs. Particularly on goods that allow for large shipping volumes like RAT/DW. You could make an argument for C farming locally as the logistics on large volumes of that are more difficult but I'd argue you're really shooting yourself in the foot long-term going hard into RAT/DW.


[19-Jan-22 05:55 AM] domicius#0000
Yes, at scale all things change because you have to maximise marginal revenue.


[20-Jan-22 06:01 AM] dasefx1#0000
@namthorn if you need LST on deimos in future, write to me, as if I had high stock I can sell you cheaper than 80 p/u. For me 55 p/u is fine ]


[20-Jan-22 06:05 AM] namthorn#0000
ah ok cool, I'll give you a shout in future, sure.


[20-Jan-22 10:32 AM] artokun#0000
I have nearly a shipment of AL ready 185 AL. Was planning to sell at exchange but can defer to corp if needed at 275/u. Trying to sell at CX so I can save up for harmonia base

throw in a couple of BTAs and the base will be mostly built. I have ~20 BBH already and the LFABs. @artokun you will need to buy MCG and 12 PSL


[20-Jan-22 01:08 PM] kharadan#0000
I can provide MCG


[20-Jan-22 01:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can organize the 12 PSL buy on ANT for about 17k.


[20-Jan-22 01:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh great, MCG covered.


[20-Jan-22 01:28 PM] artokun#0000
ill put up a buy order once my AL sells in the CX


[20-Jan-22 01:28 PM] artokun#0000
should net around 55k


[20-Jan-22 01:29 PM] kharadan#0000
and for PSL I bought bunch of them in HRT, they have better prices there. If you happen to be at that area, you may get a good deal


[20-Jan-22 01:30 PM] artokun#0000
fuel prices are still too steep for FF to make that round trip


[20-Jan-22 01:30 PM] artokun#0000
i've never tried shipping though, might give that a shot


[20-Jan-22 01:31 PM] kharadan#0000
agree, I was there for completely different reason. It's not worth just for this


[20-Jan-22 03:54 PM] insensless72#0000
Im just tuning in so idk what is needed, but I have 44 BSE 30 BBH and every type of lfabs if needed


[20-Jan-22 04:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

We need it to fully supply the infirmary on Nike, and if you can produce any excess GL, you could ship that at the same time.


[21-Jan-22 05:23 AM] namthorn#0000
how much call for GF products is there internally? i've got 2 running just basic glass atm but can scale that up if there's demand for more than 40-50/d or take orders for things like TUB

@hereanyone interested in discount TIO on Deimos?


[23-Jan-22 05:15 PM] artokun#0000
What recipes use Ti?


[23-Jan-22 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ASE


[23-Jan-22 05:15 PM] artokun#0000
I guess I could smelt some?


[23-Jan-22 05:15 PM] artokun#0000
But I can‚Äôt afford any yet


[23-Jan-22 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You could, it is more difficult to sell than lower-tier metals but the prices are high


[23-Jan-22 05:16 PM] artokun#0000
How much are you selling it for and from where?


[23-Jan-22 05:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I ship it in from KI-401b, I have an extraction base there


[23-Jan-22 05:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On the CX I would sell for 150 each, but if you will be smelting yourself on Deimos, I will do 90 each


[23-Jan-22 05:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is convenient this way, because I can pick up 185 AL and bounce to Nike after making the transaction


[23-Jan-22 05:19 PM] artokun#0000
That could work!


[23-Jan-22 05:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have done similar trades with Insensless in the past, but he has moved his focus away from TI smelting for the time being.


[23-Jan-22 05:19 PM] artokun#0000
I can do 275 for a ship load


[23-Jan-22 05:20 PM] artokun#0000
What‚Äôs he moved onto now?


[23-Jan-22 05:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
90*(316 TIO) = 28440 AIC


[23-Jan-22 05:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
he was doing TIO -> TI -> FET/AST, but now his ASMs are focused on FAL as part of a deal with Yaro. Yaro needs the FAL for electronics production.


[23-Jan-22 05:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since titanium is slow and FET/AST is needed in high quantities for advanced shipbuilding, we wanted to stock up before the rush.


[23-Jan-22 05:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but now FAL is the profitable use of the ASM building


[23-Jan-22 05:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also if you want less than 316 TIO, I will happily sell that, and then try to dump the rest on Deimos LM for 175 each üòà


[23-Jan-22 05:24 PM] artokun#0000
I can give Ti a try for a load to see how it goes


[23-Jan-22 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
check the markets first. Dont want you to have a nasty surprise


[23-Jan-22 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sometimes they sell, sometimes not


[23-Jan-22 05:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but I am shipping regardless


[23-Jan-22 05:25 PM] artokun#0000
K lemme see today


[23-Jan-22 05:26 PM] artokun#0000
Actually, I better finish the harmonia base before starting anything new


[23-Jan-22 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ill always have more TIO, and Deimos is my favorite place to sell it. You know who to ask!


[23-Jan-22 05:27 PM] artokun#0000
How much TIO do you make per day?


[23-Jan-22 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
about 50


[23-Jan-22 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
long distance shipping is the bottleneck. I would build more extractors if it were sustainable


[23-Jan-22 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or if I had more shipping capacity...


[23-Jan-22 05:28 PM] artokun#0000
I see, well someone has to do it


[23-Jan-22 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i move as much as I can, better than nothing and a sellers market üòÑ

Can I entice any of you to pick up one of my 30 AL contracts, i ran out of RAT/DW and need the funds to buy more


[25-Jan-22 05:11 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had plenty AL, but if you need I can borrow you for 10 days 20-30k aic. If you want, list 1 sth for  sell with amount needed


[25-Jan-22 05:14 PM] artokun#0000
That would be awesome thanks, i can pay back pretty fast once I finish my AL shipload


[25-Jan-22 05:14 PM] artokun#0000
im only 1 day away from that


[25-Jan-22 05:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
No problem, let me know you list it

posted, and thanks. You're awesome


[25-Jan-22 05:17 PM] artokun#0000
AL used to sell really well then it just dried up in LM. CX still good but takes time to get the goods together for a trip


[25-Jan-22 05:19 PM] dasefx1#0000
You welcome I listed same contract with 10 days so you can pay when you want

[25-Jan-22 05:26 PM] dasefx1#0000
Aready done


[25-Jan-22 05:26 PM] artokun#0000
whew, ok i sent it back thanks!


[25-Jan-22 05:47 PM] namthorn#0000
Always ask if you need stuff shipped, I could've taken some of your AL to CX earlier today for free to fill the extra space in my cargo hold as I'm headed there anyway. Others may be in that position in future too.


[25-Jan-22 05:52 PM] namthorn#0000
Not a common occurrence but a small shipping fee would likely be enough to cover other cases


[25-Jan-22 05:53 PM] artokun#0000
My bad, rush decision


[25-Jan-22 06:07 PM] namthorn#0000
nw, you got enough rats/dw locally to tide you over until you get supplies in?


[25-Jan-22 06:08 PM] artokun#0000
nope üò¶ i'll be out of commission for the next 24 hours

@here looking for as much C as I can get on Deimos


[01-Feb-22 10:21 AM] kharadan#0000
I'll buy any C Insensless didn't buy already :)


[01-Feb-22 10:48 AM] insensless72#0000
I think Mega might be alone in producing C on Deimos. We might need to look outside of corp or try and find someone who produces and is interested in joining


[01-Feb-22 02:39 PM] artokun#0000
posted some DW and RAT requests on LM, as usual my settlers are starving / thirsty


[01-Feb-22 02:41 PM] artokun#0000
sucks it costs so much to keep things chugging along, i don't think doing 300/u AL makes sense anymore with these consumable prices at the CX


[01-Feb-22 02:42 PM] kharadan#0000
need to turn AL into something more valuable


[01-Feb-22 02:46 PM] artokun#0000
after the harmonia base I need to upgrade the base to be able to do another vertical


[01-Feb-22 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@artokun how is your smelting efficiency? Assuming you can keep the ALO and C flowing at higher speeds, faster smelters means less consumables used by smelter workers per AL produced


[01-Feb-22 03:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also more generally, when consumables spike, its expected that prices rise everywhere after some delay


[01-Feb-22 03:21 PM] artokun#0000
it's nicely balanced, there's never any delay in resources. I have 8 smelters with all the C, O it needs. Only consumables are flux, dw and rat


[01-Feb-22 03:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
When you go to schedule a new order on the smelter, what is the net efficiency shown on that buffer?


[01-Feb-22 03:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is above the area where you would choose a recipe, and how large, etc.


[01-Feb-22 03:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also from here, it breaks down all of the factors contributing to that efficiency like worker satisfaction, experts, chamber of commerce, etc.


[01-Feb-22 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You mention that your only consumables are flux, DW and RAT. I notice the remaining pioneer consumables are missing (OVE, PWO, COF)


[01-Feb-22 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you dont currently use these, you should. Pioneer consumables will speed up your entire stack without messing up your balancing act.


[01-Feb-22 03:37 PM] artokun#0000
oh yeah forgot about the OVE


[01-Feb-22 03:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am 100% certain that you should also be buying PWO here.


[01-Feb-22 03:38 PM] artokun#0000
overall is 88%


[01-Feb-22 03:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
COF is less straightforward. depending on prices you can sometimes lose money or break even on coffee


[01-Feb-22 03:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Well, my general point is you can widen your profit margins by fully supplying your pioneers with consumables. This will make a big difference in your balance sheet, especially since you are doing highly vertical production with only pioneer


[01-Feb-22 04:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Anyone have MCG to sell on Deimos?


[01-Feb-22 04:07 PM] kharadan#0000
Just 180


[01-Feb-22 04:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill take it from you if you dont need it


[01-Feb-22 04:08 PM] insensless72#0000
I just need to repair a few buildings


[01-Feb-22 04:08 PM] rune_242#0000
Sure


[01-Feb-22 04:08 PM] insensless72#0000
If you have some to sell too FECU ill take yours as well


[01-Feb-22 04:09 PM] rune_242#0000
I only sell if you need it


[01-Feb-22 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill let you know when I need it


[01-Feb-22 04:10 PM] kharadan#0000
You can have mine, for 16 a piece


[01-Feb-22 04:10 PM] rune_242#0000
how much do you need exactly?


[01-Feb-22 04:11 PM] insensless72#0000
To be honest im not really sure, I need to repair my 3EXT there so this 180 will cover that. However, after that I will need to repair my SMEs\ and ASMs so quite a bit


[01-Feb-22 04:11 PM] insensless72#0000
By the time I get the b and lfabs in order the MCG # will change


[01-Feb-22 04:12 PM] rune_242#0000
I'l sell 300 right now if you want


[01-Feb-22 04:12 PM] rune_242#0000

If I end up needing more ill let you guys know


[01-Feb-22 04:22 PM] namthorn#0000
overall being 88% is super yikes, my 5 smelters are at 149% efficiency


[01-Feb-22 04:23 PM] artokun#0000
nice! im missing ove and the other two lux consumables


[01-Feb-22 04:24 PM] namthorn#0000
pwo is always worth it, COF is worth it if you have the capital to invest, they multiply with the cogc and experts real nicely


[01-Feb-22 04:25 PM] namthorn#0000
the only reason ive found to not use COF is if i don't have the excess capital that week


[01-Feb-22 04:25 PM] namthorn#0000
always seems to give a profit boost


[01-Feb-22 04:26 PM] artokun#0000
Yeah I'm not doing a very good job at managing my finances haha, buying stuff i don't need instead of focusing on making use my money makers got the fuel they need


[01-Feb-22 04:28 PM] namthorn#0000
good rule of thumb i use is to invest any earnings into bid orders for consumables/inputs first for the week, then any excess i use on other stuff


[01-Feb-22 04:29 PM] namthorn#0000
if you time your purchases of those to not be when you are selling you can afford to post asks to sell and bids to buy, instead of vice-versa


[01-Feb-22 04:29 PM] kharadan#0000
Need OVE? I've got OVE :)
And RCO on coming on your ship

Someone have AL to sell me on Deimos if I make a trip out? I'm running out on Phobos. Also if you have anything you want shipped from Phobos -> Deimos let me know in the next few hours and I'll take it with me. Ship is coming out 90% empty. Bringing 50 OVE for sale @ 2600 AIC (52/unit, can't go any lower with RCO so expensive right now üôÅ )


[05-Feb-22 10:22 AM] dasefx1#0000
mostly I don't have much AL excess, but I can share 50 for 250 p/u


[05-Feb-22 10:39 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sackless_jack @yjhasaday perhaps the two of you could make an Aluminum trade on Deimos?

[21-Feb-22 11:02 AM] kharadan#0000
I can get you BDE for that price
can you bump BTA a bit higher? Let's say 2250?


[21-Feb-22 12:18 PM] dasefx1#0000
@cazertanu BDE is fine you can list


[21-Feb-22 12:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@cazertanu i can do that BTA price on nike but the profit margins are more difficult on deimos, and shipping adds fuel cost of course


[21-Feb-22 12:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
@cazertanu I had BTA as well, price is fine

I could spare 50 more if you're in danger of running out. Any more than that and I'll run out myself before my next delivery.


[28-Feb-22 01:47 PM] artokun#0000
i have 20 left, so about 1 days' worth


[28-Feb-22 01:48 PM] namthorn#0000

[28-Feb-22 03:23 PM] artokun#0000
im good for 3-4 days now, that's hopefully enough time before the next shipment? I also need to sell some AL to afford it so I'm good for now, thanks for thinking of me!

Morning all, I have 94 C for sale - unfortunately my price is fixed at 270/u, I import the input mats so I can't match current CX prices üò¶

[29-Mar-22 05:35 AM] namthorn#0000
yea they're accurate prices, I make the AL myself and the LST is cheap for them. I took your ad and filled it. I won't be able to spare any additional BSE for about a week though, working on a little resource extraction expansion and they're quite BSE-heavy.

What happened on Deimos? I got the message that the COCG went on strike because upkeep not filled. Isn't it the governor's responsibility to take care of that?

Unfortunately my Deimos stock was just bought up by another corp member. Is your ship going to Nike or Harmonia any time soon? I have fuel in both those locations. Or maybe @spatial_piano has some fuel on Deimos to fill the order?


[10-Apr-22 08:30 AM] yang_mills#0000
Do you have fuel on Phobos?


[10-Apr-22 08:55 AM] yjhasaday#0000

This would be @spoooperz and @cazertanu right now. They are working with my TIO and are expecting 500 per TI


[12-Apr-22 04:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@artokun is also making TI, but I think CF has taken most of his smelter time lately so he might not have any in stock

ye i mean, if he wants to keep buying  AL be my guest xD we've got plenty of production internally and it's a nice bonus to get a 33% markup on any excess which will sell.

[14-Apr-22 04:33 AM] namthorn#0000
si no, that's probably for the Phobos market as it's more of an electronics input. SIO I would buy a small amount now and again for glass making.


[14-Apr-22 05:47 AM] rune_242#0000

[14-Apr-22 08:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
Not on Deimos. I produce MCG on Nike.


[14-Apr-22 08:53 AM] namthorn#0000
ye Nike/Phobos/Hephaestus would be your best bet. I don't think anyone in corp has a BMP on Deimos anymore.


[14-Apr-22 09:42 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I don't have a BMP on Deimos but I bring it in from my mfg base on Phobos. Currently I have 500 on Deimos ready for sale, 13/u. Is that enough for what you need?


[14-Apr-22 09:49 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm interested in SI, but I would also need it on Phobos (for producing SEA at my BMPs) and unfortunately my ship just left Deimos last night üò¶

[23-Apr-22 05:46 AM] yang_mills#0000
By the way, what's the most cost effective recipe for C? 4HCP+ 2GRN +2MAI -> 4C is the fastets one, but it's also the one that requires most crops. It's a question of balancing INC time vs FRM (+RIG) time.


[23-Apr-22 06:13 AM] allocater#0000
I don't really know, I am just the farmer, that's just the usual combo üòÑ

does anybody have 120 PE for sale?


[23-Apr-22 09:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills @allocater My opinion is to use the 4 GRN -> 4C recipe if you have a water shortage for any reason. This is mathematically the most water efficient


[23-Apr-22 09:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you have HCP, or can grow HCP easily, then the faster 4+2 recipes are good.


[23-Apr-22 09:52 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the fastest 4+2+2 recipe is a bit wasteful, ive never had enough excess to justify it.


[23-Apr-22 10:01 AM] allocater#0000
using the way I spreadsheeted my farms and FPs:


[23-Apr-22 10:02 AM] allocater#0000
so incinerator generates the most profit per minute with the full recipe, but the least profit per cyle.

I have got 5500 pioneers I can useüòÖ


[27-Apr-22 06:01 AM] namthorn#0000
few hundred bases added on in the past week increases the total pioneers on the planet by a ton, each base supports ~200 pioneers on the planet


[27-Apr-22 06:01 AM] namthorn#0000
not all of them were used up and at the end of each period, a fraction of your workers go into the reserve pool and are redistributed in a round-robin style, the 5500 are the leftovers from that


[27-Apr-22 06:03 AM] namthorn#0000
i'd expect the next few popr to show a declining pioneer count if the base adding frequency decreases, 35% unemployment is going to put a heavy malus on the pioneer happiness for weeks to come.


[27-Apr-22 06:10 AM] namthorn#0000
oh that and planetary festivities III was ran, which gave a flat 20% happiness boost, putting pioneers above the happiness threshold and causing more migration.

could be worse, could be prom and have gained 230k pioneers in a week lol

[29-Apr-22 03:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
I don't sell AL at all now. Actually, with my HWP and all the PP2, I should be one of the largest if not the largest AL consumer in the corp. So I need all the AL I produce + a bit more to sustain this consumption.

[07-May-22 04:02 AM] yang_mills#0000
Hello, @aegis76 ! Just wanted to ask what are your next expansion plans? At your stage one would like to increase somewhat the output of AL. You could add some additional SME for that. But after that? Do you want to go full AL and maximise your output? Or do you prefer to diversify? Regarding metallurgy, you could also produce some quantities of steel (STL). The iron ore could be bought in bulk on the local market on Antares II b from Mumzhar. You could also construct a metallist studio FS or a glass furnace GF. The SIO for the GF is sourced from Phobos. Another option would be to start producing basic prefabs on your base. You would need PP2 for that and use the AL+LST recipes. LST comes from Nike and many of us extract it there. You could then both consume your prefabs for your own expansion and sell them for cash. Let us know what you prefer, and @insensless72 and myself could guide you.


[07-May-22 07:03 AM] aegis76#0000
My plan was to increase AL production with more smelters and then possibly expand into prefabs. But that was while solo. If we need items that are not made as much I'm open to suggestions


[07-May-22 07:13 AM] aegis76#0000
I'm looking around at different recipes using AL and for now I think I need to increase smelting considerably. I think someone said we make ships. If there's a random part we need I'd love to get into that


[07-May-22 07:37 AM] allocater#0000
AL sounds great, I need about 100 per day üòÑ You can also get a 200k loan if you sell 1 AL for 200k, so you can build more smelters faster.


[07-May-22 07:56 AM] insensless72#0000
vertical AL thru prefabs is a solid start. That is how I started. Construct some PP2s on Deimos, have a corp member haul some LST for you (I would be happy to) and start pumping out bfabs. Get some cash under your belt and then we can talk about getting you involved in the ship building process


[07-May-22 08:02 AM] aegis76#0000
Great I'll run some numbers tonight and see where I want to go


[07-May-22 08:13 AM] namthorn#0000

[08-May-22 11:24 AM] yang_mills#0000
@aegis76 Do you want some cheaper prefabs and MCG for expansion? I could sell you some on Nike LM. Let's say for one more production unit. Corporate rates are 800 AIC/BBH, 800 AIC/BDE, 600 AIC/BSE, 500 AIC/BTA and 15 AIC/MCG. Since you don't have a base on Nike, you would need to rent warehouse space there to be able to post your ads. You can cancel it when you don't need it anymore.


[08-May-22 12:08 PM] insensless72#0000
@Deimos I am going to start producing UTS as multiple people have requested it at this point. I will mix it in with ship components through the FS so it might not always be available right away


[08-May-22 12:11 PM] insensless72#0000

I have been using more STL than I anticipated on Nike here recently. Whats your production rate on Deimos?


[19-May-22 06:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
It depends. If I would produce only STL and the FE required for that, my output would be 35,7 STL per day. But of course I don't do that and most of the time I produce AL. So I produce STL only occasionally when I fill that I have more AL than I can ship to Nike.


[19-May-22 06:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
How much STL do you need? Is it for Rfabs?


[19-May-22 06:43 PM] yang_mills#0000
It takes about 24h to first produce 4 FE and then convert it into 4 STL. And I have 9 SME on Deimos.


[19-May-22 07:02 PM] insensless72#0000
It is for rfabs, lets just keep our regular production and you keep selling me the STL as you have it. I would be a waste to divert your whole production to STL with the limited number I need


[19-May-22 07:02 PM] insensless72#0000
Realistically I could produce it myself but I prefer to buy it


[20-May-22 02:30 AM] rune_242#0000

not for a lil bit, I can drop some at Nike on my next trip from griffonstone though if you dont mind meeting 1/2 way. 1 ship is currently servicing my resource extraction bases and the other will be doing a supply run to from griffonstone -> Nike -> CX -> griffonstone shortly.


[26-May-22 06:02 PM] churavis#0000
That's good to kknow, thanks


[26-May-22 06:03 PM] insensless72#0000
We also have several other members who produce FLX in corp (sorry to undercut you @namthorn ) Yang and DLR as well. I believe we still produce enough to maintain corp consumption


[26-May-22 06:03 PM] insensless72#0000
though if not this could be a good thing you @rune_242  with your new base on NIke


[26-May-22 06:05 PM] namthorn#0000

If you can find it on Nike in less than 3h 18m, I will gladly ship it to Deimos for cheap. We have more constructors there than Deimos

400 FLX just landed, 60/u


[04-Jun-22 06:01 PM] yjhasaday#0000
How do you do 60/u - I make FLX on Nike but I am  losing money on 60/u üò¶ I've put my corp price at 80 üò¶


[04-Jun-22 06:11 PM] namthorn#0000
LST ~38/u, 1 LST = 10 FLX = 600 gross, each order takes ~7.66hrs. I find it hard to run at a loss like that. Did the calcs a long time ago but consumable prices are broadly the same with the exception of COF.


[04-Jun-22 06:15 PM] namthorn#0000
other production subsidizes it in the case of wild consumable fluctuation also (e.g. HAL -> CL which is the majority of my runs). This price is partly to give corp smelters a competitive edge too, the market price of FLX used to hover around 70/80 when i set this


[04-Jun-22 06:17 PM] yjhasaday#0000
ah, I'm not on Griffonstone, nor do I have experts so my CHP runs FLX in 12:52 per run - thats prob why I can't match 60/u lol


[04-Jun-22 06:18 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, experts and cogc are amazing.

I just setup my first GFs on Deimos in the last week or so (now 2 on Deimos, 1 on Phobos), hopefully I'll be helping with GL/NG/RG supply soon. However I am running mainly TUB on them until we can get ahead with Phobos infrastructure

Bobemor established the Deimos Governorship corp and runs it himself. he claims that he funds Deimos inf through the tax revenue only. So I think he "prioritizes" whatever with the tax income and when he runs out he runs out

If people need fuel on Deimos let me know, I can stockpile a depot instead of dumping on the CX. I've got more coming in than I can spend with my two ships.

I wouldn't mind picking up a little bit on deimos tomorrow. My ship is gonna be flying out a ways and it'd be nice to stop up.


[01-Jul-22 10:31 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dersix , we have  @artokun with a dedicated titanium base, but he is not as active as we are


[01-Jul-22 10:32 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also have a core module teleport ready in my warehouse on KI-401b, because i figured we were at risk of TI shortage


[01-Jul-22 10:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dersix your original message was in general, but i bring this up in deimos because most of the corp TI has run through this planet in the past for various reasons.


[01-Jul-22 11:09 AM] emperyan11#0000
I've got 1197 FF right now on site. Put up a buy and I'll fulfill.


[01-Jul-22 12:34 PM] dersix#0000

[01-Jul-22 12:49 PM] namthorn#0000
I have 47 TI and 468 TIO on deimos and can add more extractors to se-648c if we need a lot of TIO


[01-Jul-22 12:49 PM] namthorn#0000
people can just @ me and request it if they want some ore


[01-Jul-22 12:50 PM] namthorn#0000
ditto for the metal


[01-Jul-22 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn I think I will prefer to buy TIO on deimos and get smelting, seems like a strong market for ALO atm so that will work out


[01-Jul-22 12:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I need to supply allocater with TI in ~10 days for ship building, but I think i can swing this pretty easily with my own smelters


[01-Jul-22 12:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so that current 47 TI can go to pokter


[01-Jul-22 01:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
let me know your unit price on the TIO, ill buy a bunch


[01-Jul-22 01:01 PM] namthorn#0000

I need GL


[05-Jul-22 04:24 PM] yang_mills#0000
1 SIO -> 10 GL, takes 16h48min. How many glass furnaces are you going to build and what for?


[05-Jul-22 04:25 PM] churavis#0000
I know, 1 EXT can support as many GF as there is space to build


[05-Jul-22 04:26 PM] yang_mills#0000
It's a simple curiosity. Why do you want that much GL? Does it sell well on the CX?

[05-Jul-22 04:33 PM] namthorn#0000

[05-Jul-22 05:41 PM] yjhasaday#0000
The issue is that we need more GFs - you would be better off building some GFs on Deimos than making an SIO base because you get the metallurgy bonus. We can just buy SIO from earlier players on Phobos, 100 SIO will last a single GF almost 2 months if it is rotating GL and TUB


[05-Jul-22 05:47 PM] namthorn#0000
depends on base space, if deimos base is already full it's probably a good idea to make another metallurgy cogc somewhere,


[05-Jul-22 05:47 PM] churavis#0000
My Deimos base is full, exactly 500


[05-Jul-22 05:48 PM] namthorn#0000
i had a feeling it might be, is there any other decent ore planet? i do agree with SIO being fairly easy to import


[05-Jul-22 05:48 PM] churavis#0000
Its a temperate MCG planet only 2 jumps from Deimos and 1 jump from Harmonia


[05-Jul-22 05:50 PM] namthorn#0000
yea it's a good location, was just thinking about potential side-gigs to make the extractors more profitable.


[05-Jul-22 05:51 PM] churavis#0000
I might do some SI too


[05-Jul-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000

it's a waste product from AMLs


[05-Jul-22 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[05-Jul-22 05:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think the glass planet near deimos is a good solution.


[05-Jul-22 05:53 PM] namthorn#0000
definitely will want a cogc and maybe an INF? not sure how many settlers a single base can support with no popi


[05-Jul-22 05:53 PM] churavis#0000
There's one other base that that has already built a lv1 SST


[05-Jul-22 05:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Were to the point that the HE needs to be divided several different ways. Rune needs it, im out, Allocater needs it, Yang needs it etc. When you have a large chunk we'll send out a ship and divide it

Gonna pick up a bunch of bmats and supplies to increase production so the next shipment can come quicker.

We do care about gold, just not the gold itself or its absolute value. We care about having more gold than all the other CEOs. That's what conveys status and when you already have enough money to buy ten times more than anything else you might want, status is the only thing you will never get enough of

I have a base on Deimos grinding ALO -> AL, instead of selling it for small profits I move mine to Nike to have it combined with LST into bfabs, bigger profits

You could also use other mats to get lfabs, and if you sell them on the CX, biggg profits


[25-Jul-22 07:53 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'll second what @Deleted User pointed out - there is always demand on Nike for AL. The hardest part is generally the transportation because AL is so damn heavy!

I'm currently building out the base on Deimos still, so I'm just going to be selling the AL (or whatever anyone else needs to smelt) for now.

One of my main goals for the base was to actually supply AL to anyone in the corp that needed it.

Consuming it myself to build something better down the road is probable, but for now I'm just looking to get it into the hands of whoever can use it.

Exactly. I've been trying to play this as a slow burn kinda game. So I don't mind chilling at lower tier industries for a while before moving up to bigger stuff. 

As long as it turns some kind of profit and I can keep playing I'm good. If it takes a little longer to get somewhere, that just means I get to have fun for longer before the game is "over"

If there's still any TIO, I've got a few smelters that could use something to burn.

[07-Aug-22 12:06 PM] exeler#0000
I frequently end up with more C on Deimos than I currently use for smelting, so if you throw up C buy ads for 300/u I'll scoop them up if I've got a reserve.


[07-Aug-22 12:06 PM] allocater#0000
how much are you looking for? in theory we want to convert it into cargobays, but if there is a pileup of TI(O) because ASM can't smelt it fast enough, you could get some


[07-Aug-22 12:25 PM] rune_242#0000
just the TIO for myself


[07-Aug-22 12:25 PM] rune_242#0000

Does anyone have in stock or could make AEF?


[07-Aug-22 10:02 PM] exeler#0000
I've been looking at expanding my Deimos base, and I had originally thought to just do 100% SME for processing a ridiculous amount of ALO/TIO. I'm starting to realize just how much ore I would need to get my hands on to keep that running. I definitely make enough C to keep with that that many SME, they use a lot less than I thought they did and I'm running out of space to store the C (which makes it hard to pick up ALO LM orders üòÖ).

Are there any other metallurgy related things that would help out the corp? I was looking at building some FS and/or HWP. I think it'd be cool to be able to build my own BHP to repair my ships, but I don't know if the demand for that is already more than covered in corp already or not. Even if I still go mostly SME, I don't think swapping a few out for a higher tier facility would make too much of difference in overall ability to churn through ore.


[07-Aug-22 10:06 PM] churavis#0000
You're going to want an STO

[14-Aug-22 03:21 PM] exeler#0000
I think I saw a few people have EXT here, but I usually just grab it on the LM or CX. It's not a very long flight to the CX, so it is easy to just pick up a ton, and I've found there's plenty of people happy to not have to ship their ALO to the CX and would rather sell it directly on Deimos LM.

I played this upgrade a tad aggressive, especially since I also threw a ton of money at repaying a loan at the same time

The ai area lacks a good agricultural planet, so that we are limited in production capacity by C.


[23-Aug-22 09:29 PM] churavis#0000
80 FE Available


[23-Aug-22 09:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don‚Äôt know. I have made my own C on Demeter for a while and run 10 SME on Deimos without issue. You can also just buy C on the CX. It‚Äôs profitable. Not every region should be a carbon copy of every other


[23-Aug-22 09:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
At the same time, besides metallurgy, I also need to make plastics.


[23-Aug-22 09:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
So C is nervous. Not to mention that I still need consumer goods such as cof. Agricultural planet is really not enough unless I cross regions.


[23-Aug-22 09:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
This is a trading game; you can‚Äôt make everything yourself. We‚Äôve got a lot of suppliers for things and the CX is there to be taken advantage of. Obviously play as you wish, but I would find it hard to be completely vertically integrated, particularly if I only had two ships


[23-Aug-22 10:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
According to my transportation capacity, I estimate that building the industrial chain of b-prefabs will reach my limit.


[23-Aug-22 10:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
The next step is to expand the cabin and build a ship.


[23-Aug-22 10:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
if you are not self-sufficient to a certain extent, you will find that you need frequent operations to balance your supply and demand, which will affect your energy input in other fields.


[23-Aug-22 10:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then, the price difference between Corp and CX and the price fluctuation of CX will make it very troublesome to calculate the raw material cost. I prefer that I directly export finished products, and then import finished products from others. Intermediate products are produced and consumed in my own industrial chain.


[24-Aug-22 12:25 PM] allocater#0000

[21-Sep-22 09:18 AM] exeler#0000
If @insensless72 has enough TI for a little while I can swap my SME to AL or start producing a balance instead of 100% TI. 

I was also toying with the idea of building a second metallurgy base in that system on the FEO planet, mostly for WEL and FS, but could also put some SME on there to smelt even more things, but that's gonna be a little ways out as I'm focused on getting my Griffonstone base up and running right now.

[27-Sep-22 08:04 PM] jackinabox86#0000
We have to rethink our sme economy. Given insenseless was paying 1k for people to smelt TIO


[27-Sep-22 08:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don‚Äôt know if the payment he got for the TI covered that expense


[27-Sep-22 08:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
I see Pokter has ASM@exeler


[27-Sep-22 08:10 PM] exeler#0000
I don't know what he was doing with it, but I got almost all of my TIO from @allocater  and sold the TI to @insensless72.

I think @allocater was the one losing out here as I made a lot of money, and @insensless72  got basically a 50% discount on the TI


[27-Sep-22 08:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can also build your own ASM to digest this part of Ti.


[27-Sep-22 08:16 PM] jackinabox86#0000
He was running ASMs and using the TI on discounted ship inputs. I don‚Äôt think he was making any money either. Some of that 1k you were making per TI was coming from other profits he had


[27-Sep-22 08:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
In this process, I think only the outsourced smelting TIo link can make money.


[27-Sep-22 08:18 PM] exeler#0000
Ahh, so TI is WAY over priced right now? Or perhaps the discount on ship parts was just super generous? Looks like most people who take it to the CX won't accept less than 2k/u


[27-Sep-22 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
You should consider the transportation cost of Tio and the cost of developing Tio planet.


[27-Sep-22 08:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Obviously, our internal shipbuilding industry is more inclined to public utilities.


[27-Sep-22 08:22 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Half the TIO was insensless‚Äôs as well. Both he and allocator were on that planet producing at a loss


[27-Sep-22 08:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think they can bear the loss, but you are a new player, so they will leave you a profit margin in the internal price setting.


[27-Sep-22 08:29 PM] jackinabox86#0000
That‚Äôs my point. The current model for smelting TI might not be sustainable. Once we know how much TI we need from Allocator, then we can either have players do their own smelting for their ASMs or offer to pay other players to smelt the TI once they know how much the FET is worth


[27-Sep-22 08:40 PM] churavis#0000
For a while, TIO and TI were impossible to find outside of the corp while upgrade packages were in high demand so in terms of just not losing ship production due to lack of TI I'm sure that it was worth it to them


[27-Sep-22 10:43 PM] exeler#0000
Looking at the LCB on the CX, it looks like he was willing to buy one for 350k, and Melon is asking for 425k for one.

I'm assuming a "good" price for that is actually something like 375-400k?

It takes 200 AST and 20MFK to make one LCB. I'm going to ignore the MFK cost as essentially negligible (It's a little less than 3 STL in an FS for less than 8 hours total).

200 AST is 50 orders, which costs 50 AL and 150 TI in total. Assuming AL is around 400/u , and TI is 2k/u, the metal inputs cost around 320k with the vast majority of that cost being in TI.

For the other styles of cargo bays it's essentially the same deal, just more FE and less AL involved. Since most of the cost is TI anyways, it seems like AL vs FE doesn't make much of a difference. Especially since sourcing both of them seems to be roughly the same amount of difficulty. 

Do we have a good idea of what the ship kits would sell for? That'd help us figure out reasonable prices for things through the chain. Based on the napkin math, 400k seems doable if you're not losing a bunch of money somewhere.


[27-Sep-22 10:52 PM] exeler#0000
There's currently ~600 TIO on the CX for under 250/u. At 300/u my break even cost (as estimated by PRUNer) is around 1000/u for TI. I'd be very happy selling it at 1500/u under current market conditions.


[27-Sep-22 10:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Aim high and drop the price if they don't sell, there's probably still more demand than supply for upgrade kits


[27-Sep-22 10:56 PM] exeler#0000
If there's more demand than supply for the upgrade kits, it seems like we'd want to build a lot more ASM to bring the alloy production a little closer to the SKF usage of it. With just 5 ASM to 1 SKF there's a huge discrepancy between the amount of alloy produced vs consumed. Especially if those alloys are also used for things other than just the cargo bays and STL fuel tanks.


[27-Sep-22 10:56 PM] exeler#0000
But that's separate from the current problem of a large chunk of our ASM and SKF capability just left the corp üòÖ


[28-Sep-22 01:15 AM] allocater#0000
yes, we need someone new to operate SKF and support it with ASMs


[28-Sep-22 09:24 AM] jackinabox86#0000
The ASMs don't just support the SKF.  As I said, I'm building one ASM today to support my 2 SPFs.


[28-Sep-22 09:26 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I think the constraint to our shipbuilding has been things other than the SKF typically.  Right now it's engines from me because of the challenges getting a full workforce on Heph.  I think we should just get the 4 ASM remaining built as quick as we can (staffing it is a lot harder than building them) and then we can reevaluate what the constraints are in our ship building process.  Allocator has it all priced out, and it's tracked very very nicely in the ship-status channel


[28-Sep-22 01:18 PM] _bojidar#0000

[28-Sep-22 04:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000

Does the efficiency number match in prunner vs. in the PRODCO buffer?


[01-Oct-22 04:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or maybe.. is there anything unexpected in PRODCO that might explain the difference


[01-Oct-22 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
16h 11m is without coffee and PWO


[01-Oct-22 04:03 PM] seraphx2#0000
only basic food

i dont have luxury on Deimos at the moment


[01-Oct-22 04:04 PM] seraphx2#0000
even so, either of those alone or both, don't get me to 15h 7m


[01-Oct-22 04:04 PM] seraphx2#0000
at least not in Prunner


[01-Oct-22 04:05 PM] seraphx2#0000
i cant figure out what's missing prunner


[01-Oct-22 04:05 PM] churavis#0000
I can sell you up to 100 PWO on Deimos, on credit if you need


[01-Oct-22 04:06 PM] seraphx2#0000
maybe. but right now, i just need the EXT times to match or all of the calculations im seeing in Prunner are gonna be wrong


[01-Oct-22 04:06 PM] seraphx2#0000
but i can't seem to set anything to get the EXT cycles to match PrUn


[01-Oct-22 04:07 PM] churavis#0000
How recently did you download or update PRUNner?

[01-Oct-22 04:16 PM] seraphx2#0000
there isn't really an uninstaller with prunner though.
i just copied the folder from the zip file out to a new standalone folder and fired it up


[01-Oct-22 04:16 PM] seraphx2#0000
still same result


[01-Oct-22 04:17 PM] seraphx2#0000
one thing though, if you notice is that Deimos is only supposed to be able to do 14 per cycle. the EXT has it set to 15


[01-Oct-22 04:17 PM] seraphx2#0000
and Prunner partly seems to know that


[01-Oct-22 04:17 PM] seraphx2#0000
but it looks like the "recipe" is wrong


[01-Oct-22 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
In the corner of that original screenshot you circled the 14 on H2O. the 28 ALO is the resource richeness number.


[01-Oct-22 04:18 PM] churavis#0000
Is the output amount on the right correct if you manually calculate it?


[01-Oct-22 04:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can't explain the 15h 7m in game vs. 16h 11m in prunner though.


[01-Oct-22 04:19 PM] seraphx2#0000
isnt the output static and the only thing ever affected is how fast the output is created?


[01-Oct-22 04:19 PM] churavis#0000
The total daily output


[01-Oct-22 04:20 PM] seraphx2#0000
right but per cycle


[01-Oct-22 04:20 PM] seraphx2#0000
total daily output is affected by cycle time. the amount it will output per cycle never changes


[01-Oct-22 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
It should be constant for a planet's given resource richness and the "overall efficiency".


[01-Oct-22 04:20 PM] seraphx2#0000
oh


[01-Oct-22 04:20 PM] seraphx2#0000
wait i see what you mean


[01-Oct-22 04:21 PM] seraphx2#0000
i always forget about this


[01-Oct-22 04:21 PM] seraphx2#0000
prunner defaults to 100%


[01-Oct-22 04:21 PM] seraphx2#0000
at least i think


[01-Oct-22 04:22 PM] seraphx2#0000
no nevermind...that's not it


[01-Oct-22 04:23 PM] seraphx2#0000
but even efficiency still just affects cycle time


[01-Oct-22 04:23 PM] seraphx2#0000
doesnt it?


[01-Oct-22 04:23 PM] seraphx2#0000
maybe i'll move over to PCT server and ask Jacu


[01-Oct-22 04:24 PM] seraphx2#0000
i can't see a setting in here that should be affecting this. because all of things i could do, don't get me a matching cycle time


[01-Oct-22 04:26 PM] seraphx2#0000
oh wait. one thing i just noticed, i was looking at H2O. but even still i guess max is 28 ALO per day, per extractor if i have everything maxxed. but i don't, but that should'nt affect the value in the Order. it looks like the Order value is wrong. maybe the Order recipe changed?


[01-Oct-22 04:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think we ruled out: experts, cogc, HQ bonus, corp HQ bonus, production line condition, worker count, correct luxury goods


[01-Oct-22 04:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Correct, output count of extractors per cycle never changes on a given planet, only the cycle time changes when efficiency improves


[01-Oct-22 04:31 PM] seraphx2#0000
right so the fact Prunner has 15 might be the problem


[01-Oct-22 04:31 PM] seraphx2#0000
it should be 14


[01-Oct-22 04:32 PM] churavis#0000
Here's a really weird thing, I just manually calculated the total daily output of ALO in my Deimos base and it comes out to the same as what PRUNner calculates given the same efficiency assumptions. This is despite the fact that the recipe output is 15 instead of 14, but the recipe timing is higher too, by the exact amount necessary to cancel out the erroneous output amount.


[01-Oct-22 04:33 PM] churavis#0000
It gets the right answer, just with different recipe inputs


[01-Oct-22 04:33 PM] seraphx2#0000
hmm


[01-Oct-22 04:33 PM] seraphx2#0000
so my production line shouldn't technically be wrong then


[01-Oct-22 04:33 PM] churavis#0000
No, it won't mess up the ratios at all

[01-Oct-22 04:36 PM] seraphx2#0000
i was wondering if it was possible the extra unit was accounted for in the extra time, but i am not sure what all the math pieces are to calculate that


[01-Oct-22 04:39 PM] churavis#0000
(24 / (Hours + (minutes / 60))) x production buildings x output = total daily output


[01-Oct-22 04:41 PM] seraphx2#0000
oh right, i guess it doesn't matter per cycle. just figure out what both values would give you in a day.  i guess that's a duh. i do already have that exact calculation in a spread sheet just was tunnel visioning on the single cycle values i was seeing  lol

The prices I set on the LM orders should beat these by a fair bit, would you mind filling as many of them as you can? In particular, I think this covers the STL one that are the important ones for the HWP.

Sounds good, I was planning on standing up a second SME base there sometime soon as well. I want to beef up my C production on Harmonia first, and that'll require a solid source of H20.

Dw benefits the  Antares cx, but we have continuously lost two main metallurgical and construction personnel.


[06-Oct-22 03:22 AM] yuen8241#0000
Tactically, I think the priority is metallurgy (after all, C is very cheap now) and then bfabs.

[21-Oct-22 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, I have stocked too many metals, alloys, WCB and so on in deimos, and I have never had time to transport them away. I'm ready to start clearing the inventory. The price of alloy in the market is very abnormal. If you buy alloy at that price, whatever you use alloy to make will be a loss.

If it's desperate, I could probably also do 200 on Nike


[12-Nov-22 08:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Wouldn't have to be all at once, running lfabs is significantly more AL than bfabs. 1500 is just roughly how much free storage I have


[12-Nov-22 08:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Thanks, I will send contracts soon


[12-Nov-22 08:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can reserve you a bit of AL from my smelters on Deimos. I don't have a huge excess, but I'm cutting back on AST production so I will have some extra.


[12-Nov-22 08:58 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
That would be good, I can send some long term contracts or send them when you have some ready?


[12-Nov-22 09:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll save the excess for you, since I'm not sure how much it will be. That last pile of 900 was over 38 days.. so I'd say my excess now is something like 30/day only


[12-Nov-22 09:35 PM] exeler#0000

Have you considered building a base on Harmonia and Norwick to make your own?


[16-Nov-22 11:41 AM] _bojidar#0000
everyone should make there own?


[16-Nov-22 11:45 AM] churavis#0000
At some point yes. RAT, DW and COF production use a lot of area so it's hard to make a huge surplus. My  Harmonia and Norwick bases are dedicated to almost nothing other that RAT, DW and COF and I only produce a slight surplus that all goes towards Phobos upkeep.


[16-Nov-22 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
There just aren't that many fertile planets out there, so I definitely like to push everyone to having a FRM planet or two (Demeter and Harmonia).

He has loads on KI-401b if you're willing to fly there.


[05-Dec-22 08:56 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think it's better to buy TI directly from CX. It's more profitable to produce AL now, and the earned money can buy more TI.

[06-Dec-22 12:16 PM] exeler#0000
I fly empty off of Griffonstone pretty regularly, and ship stuff off of Deimos more than I ship to it.

I'd be happy to cart NA to Deimos regularly.

[06-Dec-22 12:49 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I think consumption will be pretty slow, I don't see my own needs being more than 3-4 per day. That's on 6 GFs running GL fairly frequently

Does anyone have GL and RG for sale? I have a large demand.


[13-Dec-22 08:00 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
There seems to be excess ALO available in corp and on the CX? I want to tear down my EXT and go full SME and a couple of GF to feed rfab production.


[13-Dec-22 08:01 PM] churavis#0000
That's probably a good idea, although the market will eventually correct itself as ALO producer's, like yourself, move to tear down production or increase consumption of it


[13-Dec-22 08:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
GF is very profitable now, and SME is also very profitable in producing AL.


[13-Dec-22 08:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
After adjusting GL's production formula, the output seems to have increased a lot.


[13-Dec-22 08:38 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I can sell RG - up to 300 on Deimos for 350/u


[13-Dec-22 08:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
I want to buy them all.If no one else wants it.


[13-Dec-22 08:45 PM] gladeowl#0000
I think we have a fair few EXT only bases on Deimos to handle the demand in-corp.


[13-Dec-22 08:58 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I will drop the EXT, at worst I will have to add another permit and expand if ALO supply gets tight like I had originally planned.


[13-Dec-22 08:59 PM] churavis#0000
No, at worst you should put a base on Nascent and extract ALO there


[13-Dec-22 08:59 PM] churavis#0000
It's got a resource extraction COGC


[13-Dec-22 09:04 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
shipping the required 200-250 ALO/day seems like a logistical nightmare. ALO doesn't make great use of a 3000/1000 ship, it's only 4-5 days


[13-Dec-22 09:05 PM] churavis#0000
You can build more ships but you can't build more area


[13-Dec-22 09:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
2k is more suitable for transporting ALO


[13-Dec-22 09:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
A better choice is to buy it from people outside Corp on LM of deimos, and then build your own EXT if it is not enough for a long time.


[13-Dec-22 09:07 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, even at it's most expensive ALO is cheap


[13-Dec-22 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
Industries that don't need energy and have low entry barriers will have lower and lower returns in the long run, such as ALO and H2O. The lowest population, without raw materials, can be built on MCG planet.


[13-Dec-22 09:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
H requires AEF, INS and VCB, EDC requires a lot of Rfabs, advanced population and consumables. so their entry barriers is much higher.


[13-Dec-22 09:17 PM] gladeowl#0000
My current production of the EXT-only base is 330/d, with the maximum possible output being around 500/d without having to use another permit. More than happy to put in a permit if there's a demand for it.


[13-Dec-22 09:18 PM] gladeowl#0000
So a few bases like this should be able to handle the demand. Unless I'm horribly underestimating how AL we make.


[14-Dec-22 01:39 AM] rune_242#0000
it did that


[14-Dec-22 01:39 AM] allocater#0000
probably good to intercept more ALO from randos on the LM, so they don't ship it to the CX and it has to shipped back again


[14-Dec-22 01:48 AM] balbar#0000
wow. Pop went up by more than 10% ü§Ø

[19-Dec-22 03:30 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I can supply you O and FLX if you still need? My prices are O@60/u and FLX@100/u

Sometimes with Bfabs its best to just throw up some buy ads on the LM where you need them, corp prices are pretty standard so anyone who has stock can pick it up and fill it for you. You can post in the planet's channel to let people know what you put up - you'll see plenty of these posts in each planet's channel if you scroll up a bit. I like to put a "C" rating on my LM ads that are for other corp members to communicate its a corp ad. We used to do that all the time but I'm not sure if its still a thing lol


[19-Dec-22 03:37 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Unfortunately since I hit 7 days old today, it'll take one more week cycle to stop having a P rating, so I couldn't even do C ratings I think üòõ

@jackinabox86 How many smelters, or what have you, do you have? That's... A lot of O consumption compared to smelting AL/FE.

I have 16 TI you can have


[20-Dec-22 07:31 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now it is more appropriate to buy Ti from CX . SME can be used to produce AL or leave the base space to GF.


[20-Dec-22 07:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
The previous price of Ti was around 1k, but now it is only 725 AIC.


[20-Dec-22 07:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
The previous price of AL was around 400AIC, but now it is 520AIC.Sometimes it will even reach 600ACI.


[20-Dec-22 07:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
I suggest you raise the price of FE to 400. Now the inflation is very high. Considering that you also helped to transport it to deimos, 350 is too low.@churavis


[20-Dec-22 08:24 PM] churavis#0000
I have raised the price of the FE I sell to the CX but my costs haven't changed so I don't really see any reason to raise them, especially with the corp continually feeding me cheap FLX and O


[20-Dec-22 08:35 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

You could probably even just list it on the CX at only half-insane prices and it'll fly off the shelves.


[20-Dec-22 09:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Any particular reason why AL has been skyrocketing this way?


[20-Dec-22 09:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest factor limiting AL is that there is not enough base space.


[20-Dec-22 09:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is it just a prolonged period of higher demand than supply?

[20-Dec-22 09:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
Benten area doesn't even have AL planet.


[20-Dec-22 09:05 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
What is everyone making that even uses that much AL


[20-Dec-22 09:05 PM] churavis#0000
Bfabs and Lfabs mostly


[20-Dec-22 09:06 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah


[20-Dec-22 09:08 PM] exeler#0000
And hull plates. Basically everything that is built is made out of AL


[20-Dec-22 09:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
My ASM, CHP and BMP are also using AL.


[20-Dec-22 09:09 PM] exeler#0000
Yup, that too üòÖ  Some of the higher tier consumables need AL.


[20-Dec-22 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that ANT is the main producing area of AL, we have formed the habit of using AL from the beginning.


[20-Dec-22 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
By contrast, I am not used to producing FE-related products.


[20-Dec-22 09:10 PM] churavis#0000
A ton of Deimos AL gets exported to other factions where producing AL is much harder


[20-Dec-22 09:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe we should let every member build a deimos base. Now deimos has available plots.


[20-Dec-22 09:13 PM] churavis#0000
I thought every member did?


[20-Dec-22 09:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
Most, but not all.


[20-Dec-22 09:15 PM] exeler#0000
If you need TI I just made a lot of it. Accidentally had my SME on 50/50 TI/AL for a few days üòÖ 

Now I have no AL and a ton of TI I wasn't planning on using for a while


[20-Dec-22 09:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
@churavis Have any iron handy? I don't often need a lot, but I put up some ads on the Deimos LM. buying 180 @ 425

I don‚Äôt need TI, but if someone wants to sell me some, I‚Äôll dedicate my ASMs to AST. If I make a run from the CX, I‚Äôll buy some there, but I was trying to help him meet his need with what was available, not set up a new task for myself

[20-Dec-22 10:12 PM] seraphx2#0000
how come whenever I ask if someone needs supply everyone's just like "meh", and i resort to the LM, and yuen here needs two full bases of AL a day? lol


[20-Dec-22 10:17 PM] seraphx2#0000
how are we supposed to know these things. no one ever says this. i've been making AL for 2 months now. i've advertised as such, and no one ever speaks up


[20-Dec-22 10:18 PM] seraphx2#0000
so far i've been able to offload just fine, but buy orders on the LM for AL only go up like once a week. 2 or so from allocater and one dude who keeps putting up several orders for 500


[20-Dec-22 10:18 PM] seraphx2#0000
but i see at most like 8 orders a week. if so many people need AL, where are you guys buying it and why is no one saying anything to the corp to help out?


[20-Dec-22 10:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh I always sell my stuff to Yuen, I don't even post or PM him, I just send him contracts üòÑ


[20-Dec-22 10:19 PM] seraphx2#0000
i haven't increased production capacity because im scared i'll start over producing because i don't see much interest on the LM


[20-Dec-22 10:20 PM] seraphx2#0000
and i definitely dont have ship capacity to be moving AL around


[20-Dec-22 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think maybe more of it happens on direct contracts now, so it doesn't show up on the LM. People tend to like long term arrangements due to the stability. But there's definitely been people around looking for AL in this channel


[20-Dec-22 10:20 PM] exeler#0000
Have you tried sell orders on the LM? How long do those sit around before someone bites?


[20-Dec-22 10:21 PM] churavis#0000
Just send direct contracts to Allocater, he'll buy as much as you can produce


[20-Dec-22 10:24 PM] seraphx2#0000
well, so far i've been able to keep up with the few buy orders on the LM i mentioned and have been able to offload before i get too much.
it's just when i see only 8 or so orders a week, upping production is a bit scary if suddenly those go away


[20-Dec-22 10:26 PM] seraphx2#0000
so it's hard to gauge need. and it's just i had mentioned like twice in here that i had production i could supply but no one responded with, "hey just send me contracts every week" or something along those lines.


[20-Dec-22 10:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sorry I guess it just got missed üò¶


[20-Dec-22 10:26 PM] seraphx2#0000
i actually sell C to someone on Deimos on a weekly basis because i found an out-of-corp person who needed it. But all of the C contracts pretty much disappeared over the last month on Harmonia


[21-Dec-22 12:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
@seraphx2You can sell AL to me directly, no matter how much you have. Actually, I buy AL from CX most of the time now, because it saves my energy. Recently, my ships are in HRT and benten, and I haven't been to deimos for a long time.


[21-Dec-22 12:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
I suggest you upgrade your initial ship. Two WBCs can help you go to CX to sell your extra products.


[21-Dec-22 12:10 AM] seraphx2#0000
yeah, definitely need to do that. i can probably get both upgraded so i have more future expansion room as well.
just need to get that figured out with allocater


[21-Dec-22 12:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, I need C now, too. You can also sell C to me directly on harmonia.


[21-Dec-22 12:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
The good news is that I have 3 WCBs now. You only need to find allocator or archiel to get LFE, and that basically fixes an upgrade package. If you need, I can also provide you with a loan.


[21-Dec-22 12:16 AM] seraphx2#0000
I'm good on money. because i've been too scared to expand, im at 2mil  lol


[21-Dec-22 12:16 AM] seraphx2#0000
but id rather get my two ships upgraded before i expand anyway since im starting to have to do more transporting to get stuff sold


[21-Dec-22 12:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
Contrary to me, when I cashed in 2 million AIC, I already had 2 WBC and 3 LBC, and 2 STL.üòÖ


[21-Dec-22 12:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'd rather be rich enough to be a market maker than limit my expansion because of my transportation capacity.


[21-Dec-22 12:19 AM] seraphx2#0000
im not really interested in taking over the galaxy. just a supplier is fun enough for me  haha


[21-Dec-22 12:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
If your main products that are difficult to transport are AL and C, I can buy them all on your production planet, and we can negotiate a long-term price.


[21-Dec-22 02:44 AM] allocater#0000
AL is still profitable at 400, or even 350 or lower with cheap O and ALO. I think if you sell it on the LM it will sell like hot cakes, you can even try with 500 now and see if someone bites. It is even hitting 600 on other exchanges, so there is definitely a lack right now.


[21-Dec-22 02:46 AM] allocater#0000
I also still have 4 inefficient SME on heph, I would like to dismantle, if I can get reliable CF (see CF.AI1)

Great, sent you a contract! Make sure you have a full fuel tank - gas planets take extra fuel to take off from. It's not much but it can get you on a long journey, if its a problem I keep some emergency fuel at QJ-382g so let me know.


[24-Dec-22 10:32 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm okay for supplies on QJ so no need to bring anything from ANT - thanks for offering though!

Also if you're planning on flipping the H you bought off me on the CX I'll let you do it this time but that's generally bad practice among corp discounts. We offer discounted prices to each other to help each other grow and stabilize input costs for our production lines. There was a time when some OOGers actually sold items at a loss - now I'm pretty sure most prices on the sheet include a small profit margin but there is still a lot of potential profit sacrificed by the seller so its kind of an unspoken rule that we don't buy off each other than flip the purchase for profit at the CX


[24-Dec-22 12:29 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Understandable. I kinda figured, that's why I said a few posts ago if you mind I sell it, since I ended up dismantling my BMP/PP1 and no longer use H. I'd be fine flipping it back to a fellow corp at base cost as well, though if I end up sitting on a hold full of H, and don't need it, and no one wants it, then I may as well sell it off at that point.


[24-Dec-22 12:31 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I *think* there was someone on Deimos who wanted H beside me? Can't recall who though


[24-Dec-22 12:34 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though.... Hm... I do kinda want to set up a new, proper, BMP/PP construction mat base somewhere... At which point I'm going to want H...

I mean, not in any meaningful volume, in my experience. I'm struggling to even maintain a few days worth of inputs and supply on all my bases. On Harmonia, I'm constantly offloading en masse just to avoid hitting the max

I built an ASM on Deimos so now I have easy access to alloys for more advanced hull plates. 

I just have one, and I'm currently just slowly building a stock of AST and FET. 

If anyone wants any of the higher tier hull plates for some reason let me know and I can start cooking them up

An HTE?

I don't think it was my ship plans. My most ambitious plan was a 2k/2k with RHP instead of LHP. 

I think @emperyan11 wanted the fancy ship right?

To make the 80 ATP I'm going to need 80 BOS (I can supply the SI and AL needed for this, but don't have an AML to process it or any BOR)

I'm also going to need 40 W for the WAL to make CTF.

Good to know, thanks


[25-Dec-22 09:21 AM] jackinabox86#0000
we can source the BOS for you no problem.  I can give you some of it now actually so you can get started on the plates


[25-Dec-22 09:21 AM] jackinabox86#0000
we also have W floating around


[25-Dec-22 09:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I can sell you the BOS and the W if you can make the plates.  Then I don't have to think about it


[25-Dec-22 09:54 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, well feel free to send contract for what you need and I'll fill. 40/u on Nike


[25-Dec-22 10:01 AM] exeler#0000
That'll work. If I can get the W and BOS I can start making the plates. 

If someone with more ASM time available can turn the W into WAL (or even CTF) first then I could probably get it done sooner. 

If there's no rush then I don't mind grabbing the inputs and starting the process.


[25-Dec-22 10:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I have an ASM that's sitting empty, so I'll help with the WAL/CTF


[25-Dec-22 10:05 AM] exeler#0000
Awesome, it's two ASM steps to turn the W into the CTF I can actually use in the HWP, so if you send me WAL I can make it into CTF?

Or should we just split the W and both work on it in parallel?


[25-Dec-22 10:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
for today, lets get the W into WAL since I have that on Deimos


[25-Dec-22 10:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000

do you have AL on Deimos or do you need that?

I have everything else I need on Deimos:)

BOS and W were the only inputs I needed


[25-Dec-22 10:55 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I sent you some W to work on WAL and after you convert that,  you can start on the CTF. I‚Äôll keep working on the WAL and ship back the BOS you need so that you don‚Äôt run out of those as you do CTF and ATP

I mean, with the loan I got, technically I already can, but... Not sure if it'd be a wise use of those funds. I'm already dipping dangerously close to hitting 550k AIC, which means I've been expanding so quick I'm burning through more funds than I'm making.

Is nobody producing ALO at deimos anymore? You can probe the LM if someone is selling it for 45/u or whatever it is worth to get it locally.


[28-Dec-22 12:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its going for 42/u on the CX, so there should definitely be domestic ALO available.

[28-Dec-22 12:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
My size-1 Deimos base has 14xSMEs using 197 ALO/d according to FIO, though that number will go up with max experts and max SME's. A full SME base, which I'll have by week's end, should be around... 17? 18 SMEs? So probably close to 300 ALO/d. Maybe more.


[28-Dec-22 12:16 PM] gladeowl#0000
You're using Pruner to plan your base?


[28-Dec-22 12:17 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

I see a ton of SIO for sale on the LM... Is making SI worth buying some?


[02-Jan-23 03:01 PM] churavis#0000
I have SIO that I will sell for cheaper than the CX but most of the cost of SI is in the C since it's 1 C for every unit of SI


[02-Jan-23 03:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah, noted.


[02-Jan-23 03:01 PM] churavis#0000

[08-Jan-23 12:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Weird. Recently I've noticed random people who either don't even have Deimos bases, or have most of their bases in another faction sector, selling/buying things ridiculously over/underpriced on the Deimos LM. Like this C@550 ad that just went up & the dude trying to buy AL @250 ü§£ AL at 250... Bruh cmon.

I get the C@550, since that's halfway between bid and posting, but AL at 250 is just silly.


[08-Jan-23 12:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Am I the only fool who sells things cheaper on-world than I sell at CX? If you're going to cut shipping costs, at least pass the savings onto your client.


[08-Jan-23 12:41 AM] exeler#0000
ü§£ I actually picked up one of those cheap AL orders. I had a warehouse locked for a while because I didn't have the CSS and I figured it was time to clear it.

[08-Jan-23 12:43 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Next time you have excess AL, drop me a line and I'll take them off your hands. More AL to sell means I get better deals on bulk sales.


[08-Jan-23 12:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
...Even though 80% of the time I sell to corpmates, but still. Once in a while I drop some on the CX and make serious bank


[08-Jan-23 12:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm just generally terrible at capitalism lol. I tend to overpay and undersell, even in RL. I'd be an absolutely shit margin trader üòõ


[08-Jan-23 12:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Corp prices are a bit of a double-edged sword in that regard. I've gotten used to cheap inputs, but keep accidentally selling my stocks at corp price to non-corps then facepalming myself into the next system

[08-Jan-23 08:06 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye. Doing pretty good selling AL to @allocater  though, solid 450/u and regular contracts means stability. A fair, dependable rate  means its practically an automated process. The last place I'd have expected to make a stable income a month ago was Deimos, and now its my bread and butter. üôÇ

[08-Jan-23 06:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Valid. And if I'm going to relocate my Heph FP complex in order to take advantage of the planetary manufacturing bonus, I may as well go to the best planet for it.

Is there that much demand for the product though?


[08-Jan-23 06:08 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'd figure there's so many producers that its not really a viable product to get into, no?


[08-Jan-23 06:08 PM] churavis#0000
RAT has been at a pretty high price for a while and COF is always expensive


[08-Jan-23 06:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh true. COF is a big one.


[08-Jan-23 06:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
You‚Äôre getting lucky on getting inputs on Deimos. You can‚Äôt expect people to ship RAT there for you unless you buy from Dez. Either do that or go to Harmonis or ANat

The more complex your bases the harder it is to survive without recurring queues


[14-Jan-23 11:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
You need to buy Pro at least once, otherwise you can't even accept the contract.

My bank card in China can pay, so I believe your bank card in Brazil can also pay.


[14-Jan-23 11:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you don't have a pro or basic account, it will be disastrous for your business. In this case, it is impossible to purchase or sell goods at the company's price, and there will be additional transportation costs for cx to the base. It is also impossible to buy ships, borrow money and exchange money.

Do you plan on buying FE from me regularly in the future?


[16-Jan-23 03:30 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yes most likely, up to about 30/day when I'm fully going but only about half that right now.


[16-Jan-23 03:35 PM] churavis#0000
I can do that, I'll try keep 200 in stock for you, just send me a contract about a day or two before you need absolutely need it.


[16-Jan-23 03:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Sounds good. I took all you had now because I was completely out.

@archielvahr  How much FET do you have available, and is the price still 1100/u?


[17-Jan-23 06:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
I guess he has been producing AST and selling it to me. Usually I produce FET, but now I have only 40 FET left.

Would you be willing to sell some or all of that, and at what price?

@1.1k 40 FET avilable for you


[17-Jan-23 06:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
But I usually don't sell it, because what I produce is not enough, and I have to buy alloy. This time it's just because you need it urgently.

I'm also going to build another ASM.

My favorite is ASM and SME of deimos, but my warehouse is almost full and there is no base license.


[17-Jan-23 06:29 PM] exeler#0000
I was planning on setting up a full 500/500 base on A2b. Mostly SME to free up space on Deimos for the more advanced stuff like ASM and HWP (these things print money as long as allocater is playing market maker)


[17-Jan-23 06:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then I can produce some HSE for you.


[17-Jan-23 06:30 PM] exeler#0000
Cool, while that's going I'll spend my next permit on a Nascent base to bump up my C production. I'm only at a surplus of 8 per day now and I'm happy with not knowing what it feels like to pay the current CX prices for C


[17-Jan-23 06:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
I also have an big expansion plan recently, so I will consume some of my Lfabs. If you need a large quantity, you can also tell me the category you need in advance.


[17-Jan-23 06:34 PM] exeler#0000
I think I have the batch I need already, just waiting on my next ANT->Harmonia flight to upgrade my HQ. I have a spare permit already, so this upgrade will give me enough for both the Nascent and A2B bases

[18-Jan-23 03:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
If your Nascent INC uses the formula of simply burning MAI, two FRM bases with an area of 500 should be enough.


[18-Jan-23 03:01 AM] rune_242#0000
and sometimes the AR needs to get to nike also

in a week I'll take down my rig's on harmonia and have another permit


[18-Jan-23 03:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
H and AR do take up extra capacity, especially H, and a single VCB may not be enough.


[18-Jan-23 03:02 AM] rune_242#0000
that boat was also 4 milüí∏


[18-Jan-23 03:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you transport 1LCB of water, that is, 10k of water, it is enough to produce MAI for a very long time.


[18-Jan-23 03:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
If a FRM base produces MAI, it only consumes about 50 water per day.


[18-Jan-23 03:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you store extra MAI in nascent in advance, your transportation frequency will be very low.


[18-Jan-23 03:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
I will consider buying a VCB after a while. I can buy your H directly from the place of production.


[18-Jan-23 10:25 AM] allocater#0000

If in need just make a contract and pay what u think! üòâ

@rune_242


[20-Jan-23 03:54 AM] domicius#0000
I have 100 on Nike if you want.


[20-Jan-23 05:58 AM] neth_havoc#0000
@yuen8241 For now I have 6 SME running and produce mostly AL, which is my main source of income. I also have 2 INC that feed me with the C needed.


[20-Jan-23 06:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can sell you a batch of C/FLX at my purchase price to help you resist the price increase of C/flx. Besides, if you like, I can buy all your AL in deimos, so you don't have to transport it.


[20-Jan-23 06:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can also sell you a batch of fabs to expand your SME. If you are short of money, I can provide a loan.


[20-Jan-23 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
But the premise of my help is that you sell AL to Corp. Now I buy a lot of CX at the price of 480, and then hoard it.  I hope you can sell AL to the members of Corp for 450. After all, you saved transportation costs and raw material costs, and you also got cheap fabs and free financing.


[20-Jan-23 06:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
@neth_havocWhat do you think of my proposal? Are you interested?


[20-Jan-23 06:20 AM] neth_havoc#0000
That sounds good. Yes, I would be more then willing to sell AL to our corp.


[20-Jan-23 06:20 AM] neth_havoc#0000
FLX I will need in the near future.


[20-Jan-23 06:21 AM] neth_havoc#0000
C is for now not the problem.


[20-Jan-23 06:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you make AL, you will make more money by using FLX.


[20-Jan-23 06:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
Basically doubled now.


[20-Jan-23 06:21 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I know and I do, have still some storage of FLX.


[20-Jan-23 06:22 AM] yuen8241#0000
Generally speaking, you can expand to 10 SMEs.


[20-Jan-23 06:22 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I produce 45 to 50 AL per day, sometimes I also smelt other Ores I have.


[20-Jan-23 06:23 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Ok, so then I will do that next.


[20-Jan-23 06:23 AM] yuen8241#0000

[20-Jan-23 06:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you smelt other metals besides AL, you can even build more SME. I can help you to ship things like TIO, which will consume less C.


[20-Jan-23 06:29 AM] neth_havoc#0000
For now I have more than enough extra Ores, thx. It was primarily because till today I had just 1 EXT, but enough ALO and because I could buy some relative cheap at CX.


[20-Jan-23 06:33 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I already got a lot of support from you all, also 200k from allocator which allowed me to triple my AL production.


[20-Jan-23 06:33 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I would like to give something back to the corp at first.


[20-Jan-23 06:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm glad you think so.


[20-Jan-23 06:38 AM] neth_havoc#0000
With my ships flying around I also make some good money, so I can step by step expand to 10 SME. At least I can save on the costs of the Prefabs thx to the corp, that is already helping.


[20-Jan-23 06:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
SME base and FRM base are not expensive, and fabs consumption is not large. If you are sure to expand, I have enough stock in Nike now, and I can also provide a loan.


[20-Jan-23 06:47 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I'm sure to expand to 10 SME and I plan to have a FRM base on Harmonia to supply Deimos and all future bases with the basic needs.


[20-Jan-23 06:50 AM] neth_havoc#0000
But still, how can I pay back all that support. How will I repay the loan?


[20-Jan-23 06:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
Send me two contracts at the same time. One contract sells 1ff at the price of 180k, and the other one buys 1FF at the price of 180k. For the contract of buying FF, your performance period can be extended to 2 months.


[20-Jan-23 07:00 AM] neth_havoc#0000
That is the cost to expand to 10 SME and 6 EXT + Barracks?


[20-Jan-23 07:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
Probably enough, because the internal price of bfabs will be cheaper. I calculate your credit limit according to the number of days you play.


[20-Jan-23 07:01 AM] neth_havoc#0000
So I will have up to 2 months time to repay? I think that will be faster....


[20-Jan-23 07:02 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Okay, sounds like a plan.


[20-Jan-23 07:02 AM] neth_havoc#0000
And when I have AL rdy I just make a contract with you once a day for 450/AL?


[20-Jan-23 07:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
I just hope you can have more time, and you can always repay in advance.


[20-Jan-23 07:03 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I would try to repay as fast as possible.


[20-Jan-23 07:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can sell me every 100 AL


[20-Jan-23 07:04 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Ok, will do.


[20-Jan-23 07:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can save the quantity, type and location as a template, which will save you trouble in the future.


[20-Jan-23 07:05 AM] neth_havoc#0000

I will need around 20-25 a day.


[20-Jan-23 08:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
I bought it from CX, because flx is not used in large quantities. I can sell you 500 flx@100.

I recently released an ad in LM in harmonia to buy C for 450, and no one has finished it.


[20-Jan-23 08:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now C has risen too high. Considering that guy is still buying water, the price of RAT/C/DW will not be low.


[20-Jan-23 01:20 PM] habix3956#0000
I can spare some 100C in case of emergency @400


[20-Jan-23 02:42 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Im bringing over 800c in about 17 hours @yuen8241 . If you want they are yours for 400. Or if anyone else wants. Already selling 300 to Habix, so 500 left.


[21-Jan-23 07:13 AM] rune_242#0000

I have 4k on nascent and it stopped my production because I have to much


[21-Jan-23 07:14 AM] rune_242#0000
you can buy it for 350/u if you pick it up yourself


[21-Jan-23 07:25 AM] neth_havoc#0000
@rune_242 Contract send for 222.


[21-Jan-23 07:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can buy 1k-2k C, so that I can build inventory.


[21-Jan-23 07:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
I remember that nascent's warehouse level only allowed renting one warehouse.


[21-Jan-23 10:43 PM] seraphx2#0000
@yuen8241 just FYI, i have 200 AL provisioned on Deimos for you that you haven't picked up yet. I'm assuming you might find it, but since you've interacted with other contracts since it was provisioned, just wanted to be sure you don't miss it.


[22-Jan-23 05:49 AM] yuen8241#0000

[23-Jan-23 12:37 PM] exeler#0000
Building a ton of SME and making AL is a pretty good way to go on Deimos


[23-Jan-23 12:54 PM] martin1194#0000
seem AL is best choice.


[23-Jan-23 12:56 PM] gladeowl#0000
If you have a reliable source of C, AL is the best.

ALO would be the easiest. But you could also provide the C yourself for other players, *shipping it in from Harmonia or Nascent*.


[23-Jan-23 12:59 PM] habix3956#0000
@martin1194 ask @paxmagellanic for C

if you're running low, I can supply some


[23-Jan-23 01:08 PM] martin1194#0000
Is very low, I don't know C was hard to import. Seems I must not import consumables before I have C.
If u can provide some C, I'm very thankful.

(I'll stock up for both of us until you increase your production)


[23-Jan-23 02:14 PM] martin1194#0000
All right. I will import from u first. If I import too less from him, he will lose time on transport and lose oil.

but again.. if you're short on cash and need to sell smaller quantity msg me and I'll take it for reselling to corp

doing around 120AL/day


[23-Jan-23 02:38 PM] martin1194#0000
yuen always said to sponsor me. But I always replied to him "I wanna have some fun to build up my company." :panda_yay:


[23-Jan-23 02:39 PM] exeler#0000
Imo, the fun way to sponsor someone is to pay for a bulk order of a good up front, then they can take the money to build the base and then race against the clock to deliver the goods back.

If the price of FLX is around 100, the profit will be very low, and CHP has other more suitable products.


[24-Jan-23 08:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
It is acceptable to buy around 120

Things related to CU and AU are too heavy to be stored in deimos.

Oh, since there are many people who use these products, instead of a first-dibs system we are going to use a pie system where, at the end of 10h, we split up each product between everyone who says they want a portion, so that it doesn't just go to whoever happens to be on at the time and more can get an equal slice.

The bid price of CX of STL, SFK and MFK is close to that of Corp, so a very large inventory can be built through CX.


[23-Feb-23 07:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have about 1k STL, 1k MFK and 7k SFK in reserve.  The use of iron is relatively small.

I can spare a ton of HCC all the time as I provide a lot for allocater as well


[29-Mar-23 10:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
I will never build a second ECA, which consumes too much LI and HCC.

Is your HCC stored in ANT?


[29-Mar-23 10:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
I prefer to buy more at once, because my reserves and consumption are relatively large.


[29-Mar-23 10:51 PM] churavis#0000
I built a 4D Arcade and VR Theater on Phobos specifically to soak up my ECA production, you could do the same for Nike


[29-Mar-23 10:52 PM] churavis#0000
Deimos, I have more HCC on ANT but it's reserved for allocater along with most my future production


[29-Mar-23 10:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
In that case, the infrastructure investment is too large. I think nike is very good now. My ECA can produce just enough RAG, CBL, CBM and CBS. I don't want to build another one. It's too annoying to find enough BE, LI and HCC.

Well if you find yourself with too much POW with the 1 ECA then feel free to donate it to Phobos upkeep


[29-Mar-23 10:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
One ECA is just in balance, and two ECA is too much.üòÑ


[29-Mar-23 10:59 PM] yuen8241#0000
I always think that it is uneconomical to use CBL as MM suggested by Allocator, and it needs too many supporting industries and transportation capacity.


[29-Mar-23 11:00 PM] churavis#0000
How does it compare to the POW MM?


[29-Mar-23 11:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
The profit per unit base area of CBL is very high, which should be one of the best in MM.


[29-Mar-23 11:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
But it needs too many supporting facilities, which will lead to diluted profits.


[29-Mar-23 11:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
The industrial chain of SE is simpler, the overall profit is higher, and the consumption of transportation capacity is smaller.

I'm looking for AL please. 
I got hold of some cheap CUO and need to process it, but I don't want everything downstream to stop while I do.

And I don't use any of them myself


[03-Apr-23 11:35 AM] exeler#0000
That's how I handle hull plates so keep doing what you're doing. 

The ASM products get used in lots of different ways by different people so you're probably fine. I think some of them have higher demand than others though so the question is just finding a ratio that matches.


[03-Apr-23 11:44 AM] churavis#0000
I will take 40 FET and the 6 CTF


[03-Apr-23 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah I know the AST and FET are big ones, so I have ratios higher on those


[03-Apr-23 12:08 PM] hernanduer#0000

For the reason I have stable low-cost resource from corp member. For the give back to corp, my AL price reduce to 450.

FE auction


[03-Jun-23 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
I want some but 1600 is a touch high when I resell the cargo bays in corp. I could do 1400


[03-Jun-23 09:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
For example if FET and AST are 1600, I sell the bays for 325k and they take 200x materials. So that'd leave only 5k to cover SKF costs


[03-Jun-23 09:53 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Well the production costs for 1 AST are already around 1400. Even at 1600 it would be nearly the same profit but more convenient for me, to replace my 3 ASM with SME and produce more AL instead.


[03-Jun-23 09:54 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I'm even considering building a SKF myself and produce only 1 Bay every 5 days, which would still be more then 25k/day more profi then selling the AST for 1600/u.


[03-Jun-23 01:44 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
You should consider increasing your price, an extra 25-50k is nothing


[03-Jun-23 09:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
true it's just corp price, I'm getting TIO with an internal price too so that's why AST only runs me about 1k

On Deimos? I smelt AL there. I though that's what most people do


[22-Jul-23 04:09 AM] martin1194#0000
I thinking should I rebuild up deimos or not.  cuz this base not in my production line.
I have no idea what should I do to put it to my production line


[22-Jul-23 04:10 AM] domicius#0000
If you don't need it, strip it down and use the license somewhere else.

I can provide FEO on Deimos for your STL, oxygen too if you need


[22-Jul-23 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
You can also add an ASM and make materials for SKFs, make AST or FET, I've always been able to find people in corp who can buy them. And if we end up with too much, someone will build another SKF

I'm thinking of going all-ASM on Deimos, which will mostly make WAL/CTF, but could run AST occasionally


[03-Aug-23 01:27 AM] churavis#0000
Where will you get the AL and TI?


[03-Aug-23 01:31 AM] melon164#0000
From LM or CX, I guess, unless anyone here has excess production


[03-Aug-23 01:31 AM] melon164#0000
I have far too much TI from KI-401b


[03-Aug-23 02:01 AM] domicius#0000
I make excess AL


[03-Aug-23 02:02 AM] melon164#0000
I'd use up to 60/d AL and 25/d SI


[03-Aug-23 02:10 AM] domicius#0000
It's need to invest in extra smelting for the AL - 60pd is my current max. I don't extract enough SIO for the SI right now although with a bit of rejigging on Etherwind that seems doable


[03-Aug-23 02:11 AM] churavis#0000

Do your extracting on Nascent like me


[03-Aug-23 02:13 AM] domicius#0000
I'm already pulling ALO on Deimos and smelting. It would be easier to just get more material there, and no need to ship around.

@xfeuerdrachenx The Pro features I found most useful early on: 
1. Repeating orders (so you don't have to queue up orders) 
2. Auto unloading your ship (so once it reaches its destination, you can fill missing items like if you're out of rations) 
3. Creating contracts and local market ads so you can fully participate in the best part of this game, the multiplayer, and get sweet corp discounts.

It is important to make sure it's a game you like playing first before deciding to invest real money into it


[25-Aug-23 03:37 PM] exeler#0000
Unless the price tag for one month isn't a big deal and you want a better chance of enjoying the game

The early game can be a slow slog without help


[25-Aug-23 03:40 PM] higgsy#0000
After you pay for even 1 month of pro, you get a free basic license for life, which lets you accept ads and contracts.

I didnt took out my calculator but it seems like, the costs for fuel, the daily population consumption and other costs are higher than my income from my production. Production is really low


[01-Sep-23 02:01 PM] exeler#0000
If you're just starting out, run your ships really slow. The added fuel costs for the small time savings isn't worth it. You also want to try and run your ships as infrequently as possible so you can get more out of each trip.

If you spent 2k on fuel for a trip, but only carried 10 items that's 200 per item you spent on fuel. For most of the starting goods, that's way more than the price you'll get on the CX for them.


[01-Sep-23 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I would suggest trying a calculator like https://prunplanner.org/ to see if your math is complete

üéâ 

[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
@parisinspringtime this is basic outline for what we need. Mostly just comfort is pretty lacking, so a new 4DA should cover everything. Also 1 of the INFs is turned off, and as you can see that is capping all the downstream components here. More INFs would be good, but this'll work in the meantime

[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
new 4DA unless you can reasonably source all the PAR costs, but a couple of them are pricey


[06-Sep-23 10:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
The extra UNIs provide a bit of a boost to the education rate, that was probably the idea behind it. But yeah, it's a lot.


[06-Sep-23 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
but isn't the education rate tied to the education fulfillment? (idk really) Which would be capped by the poorly fulfilled upstream


[06-Sep-23 10:10 AM] parisinspringtime#0000

oo


[06-Sep-23 10:11 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I actually opened up 2 bases to supply the PAR materials, so it's cheaper for me to build an extra PAR than a 4DA


[06-Sep-23 10:11 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah PAR are a pain to supply


[06-Sep-23 10:11 AM] parisinspringtime#0000

maybe avoid SST 10 and go for INF 6 instead? not sure comparison on that

You have incorrect prices set
For example
```
BUYING 32 Basic Deck Elements (BDE) @ 1,000.00 AIC (31.25 ea)
```
shows that you want to buy BDE for 31.25 per unit

Sorry you are right, just AL. My fault

All good. I was just worried I'd accidentally put ALO on there. I don't produce any ALO myself, I buy it all from the corp or the CX

Why are we doing a pioneer immigration program?


[26-Jun-24 09:46 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
If you run PIO by upkeep alone, SET goes through the roof. If you try bring SET down, PIO falls faster.
(TECH & ENG needs also push SET up higher than is required)
SET is WAY too high, eating unnecessary upkeep. Thus, I'm trying to bring it down slowly.
PIO Immigration is incredibly cheap (10k), and helps offset any PIO losses from lessened SET upkeep.

Building warehouses on the planet is sort of a way to do that.

You're only getting half the land of a new base with an added permit expansion.  Permits are rather precious


[26-Feb-25 09:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
In the short term, when permits are cheap, a 1000 area base on Harmonia will pretty much perfectly supply a 500 area FP base. But you‚Äôll want to take that Harmonia base back to 500 area in the future


[26-Feb-25 09:41 AM] katinga#0000
TBF, I do have a burner base on Phobos, against the COGC, but only because I have several smelting bases relatively nearby.  I want to quickly move the carbon I produce.

ah whoops, got it mixed up then


[26-Feb-25 09:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
I would only need 1 more permit since my FP base is split between DW and RAT anyways, but i get what you mean, il probably end up removing the permit in the future..


[26-Feb-25 09:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
Every once in a while people float the idea of changing Phobos to agriculture. it's not a baaaaaaaad idea but it's just way too late and it's gonna be electronics forever

would have to make frm base on phobos, no choice


[26-Feb-25 09:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Phobos dates back to the beginning. Early universe no one was able to make INS or any other extra mats right away, so there needed to be some sort of electronics planet on a triple green somewhere in the universe


[26-Feb-25 09:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
bleh il just make it on phobos


[26-Feb-25 10:52 AM] katinga#0000
Now Life is also agriculture but I found it too costly for me to go the HYF route.  I tried it for a while.


[15-Mar-25 08:55 AM] bookliko#0000
Is it me or do the finances of Deimos not look particularly sustainable?

They aren't...


[15-Mar-25 09:19 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm pretty sure there was some charity going on before, and looking at the rates on some other similar sized planets the taxes are low.


[15-Mar-25 09:20 AM] akyantor#0000
I need to do a spot of analysis to see if we can trim any upkeep without causing issues, but suspect we'll need to make some changes one way or another to avoid the planet not paying for itself.


[15-Mar-25 09:21 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, I have topped off all the upkeep requirements... so may look disproportionately bad at the moment


[15-Mar-25 01:21 PM] bookliko#0000
Noticed the topping up. In relation to the topping up 3 weeks ago, the income is way below expense. 
I can indeed imagine Paris used a different rate for the mats. Not knowing what refrence MAT value u use right now, it might be worthwile to look for suppliers willing to charge at CX Bid (or lower), rather than CX Ask.

Consider placing /orders or /project at reduced price  here (https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/955976886113140736)


[15-Mar-25 01:46 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm pricing up upkeep payouts based upon the CX avg, so will reflect the fair value. I don't love using private deals for upkeep goods on such a large planet, as it removes opportunities for newer players to benefit from the trading activity.


[15-Mar-25 01:55 PM] bookliko#0000
Fair enough


[16-Mar-25 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I'm going to upgrade the PAR one level, that'll allow me to stop supply SOI while retaining the same level of satisfaction across most pop types. It will save 22k a day, and 154k a week in cost.

[17-Mar-25 01:16 PM] akyantor#0000
I asked if he had an alternative idea of how to handle the deficit, no response as yet.


[17-Mar-25 01:17 PM] akyantor#0000
It's going to pass most likely anyway, no other votes yet, so only my vote (as gov) and his vote (as MP). The other MPs are all OOG members.


[17-Mar-25 11:07 PM] martin1194#0000
Can we run program for reduce upkeep cost?


[18-Mar-25 01:30 AM] akyantor#0000
Its possible. Challenge will be there‚Äôs already quite a big oversupply of PIO. A general festival will likely mean that gets worse, perhaps starves out the satisfaction needed by the higher tier pops


[18-Mar-25 01:31 AM] akyantor#0000
I‚Äôll have a look though, try modelling it


[18-Mar-25 06:33 AM] akyantor#0000
@martin1194 It's not ideal to run a program without first draining the upkeep goods (or switching some buildings off), as all we'll do without doing that first is burn through both the program money and the upkeep goods.


[18-Mar-25 06:52 AM] bookliko#0000
Changed my vote to "NO" on the program


[27-Mar-25 03:11 AM] akyantor#0000
Income has started to raise, perhaps up by 300k a week last week. Will need to keep a close eye on the final figure on this first full week to understand if we‚Äôve closed the gap enough between income and costs


[27-Mar-25 03:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I‚Äôve tried various attempts in the model to reduce the costs‚Ä¶ tbh, slim pickings


[09-Apr-25 01:27 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm thinking of doing a one off festival to refill the eng pop as I think we'll end up with a deficit in the new popr.


[09-Apr-25 01:28 PM] akyantor#0000
It seems deimos needs more popi upgrades to maintain a stable pop with the cheapest goods... but nearly all of the options are expensive, with no warchest.

[09-Apr-25 01:28 PM] akyantor#0000
I think realistically the PIO tax needs to go from 20 to 25 to make the upkeep sustainable.


[09-Apr-25 01:29 PM] akyantor#0000
And then do some popi upgrades to stablise


[09-Apr-25 01:29 PM] akyantor#0000
Just need to figure out what combination of upgrades to do


[09-Apr-25 01:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Education also can work since we have a good tech pop and just need engineers


[09-Apr-25 01:30 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm going to play around with the spreadsheet tonight, see if I can figure out what's most efficient.


[09-Apr-25 01:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I need to get the supply of UTS to be consistent so the education stays uncapped.


[09-Apr-25 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that sounds good. Safety is gonna be a challenge there no matter what.


[09-Apr-25 01:31 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I noticed the SST is already maxed out...


[09-Apr-25 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
And the drone post really sucks


[09-Apr-25 01:31 PM] akyantor#0000
It gets tough to generate more saftey, as the other building has really awful upkeep goods.


[09-Apr-25 01:33 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm thinking of upgrading a culture building as the education appears to be nearly always capped by culture.


[09-Apr-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I like the large buildings too. the two are pretty balanced.


[09-Apr-25 01:37 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm wondering how cheap it'd be to run the VR Theatre using DEC.


[09-Apr-25 01:37 PM] akyantor#0000
As the ART is already quite high level


[13-Apr-25 11:03 AM] akyantor#0000
@archielvahr I think I want to upgrade the ART one more level. That'll give enough comfort to uncap education and get the ENG satistifaction to 50% using the spreadsheet model. I'm going to crunch the cost, and if possible get Phobos to fund the upgrade.


[13-Apr-25 11:13 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm going to kick off a festivities to stablise things for the coming week until the pop upgrades have an effect.


[13-Apr-25 12:40 PM] akyantor#0000
@archielvahr What's the best way to submit a request for 4.5m AIC to upgrade the Deimos ART from 7->8? Should I post in the deimos channel in game?


[13-Apr-25 12:55 PM] akyantor#0000
I've already shipped the supplies, worst case scenario I'll donate the goods for now. 

I'm going to proposed further changes to the taxes as we're barely braking even, but actually need a warchest for popi upgrades. *Deimos shouldn't have to go to Phobos to pay for upgrades... it's probably the largest pop planet in ANT space.*


[13-Apr-25 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you have a phobos base post in in Phobos coms. Otherwise this works!


[13-Apr-25 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am out of the house today so I might need a reminder. Someone had a request yesterday too I need to remember


[13-Apr-25 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it‚Äôs fine for Phobos to cover other stuff. If IDC farming ends, it might end the Phobos gravy train so we should use it while we can


[13-Apr-25 01:15 PM] akyantor#0000
That's fine. I've posted a message to request the funds.

I've submitted a motion to increase the tax take again on Deimos. I don't know if I'm just doing something massively wrong, but Deimos is a monster in terms of upkeep costs.

I think I'm going to start keeping a tracker like I did for Halyos to create some transparency.

[13-Apr-25 03:17 PM] akyantor#0000
I can't really afford to run it below cost, as don't make most of the materials myself. I only have OFF/UTS/TUB that I make myself in a vertically integrated manner. I'm buying the rest at market rates. Think planets should be self sustaining at market rates, otherwise someone's providing charity somewhere.


[13-Apr-25 03:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I may do it anyway for a bit, get a better feel for the actual costs.


[14-Apr-25 03:59 AM] akyantor#0000

Oh dear, looks like someone has placed a base using more ENG since the last popr. The plan should have avoided any open jobs, but unfortunately we‚Äôre down 50 or so.


[16-Apr-25 02:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Will need to have a look at the data again and decide what to do for the next time.


[16-Apr-25 03:04 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah, not an issue. I recall that the open jobs reflects the prior week, so the increase this week would have been enough to cover it.


[16-Apr-25 03:05 AM] akyantor#0000
So no-one should be short... just need to try to make sure that I sustain the increase in eng growth to create more of a buffer. The satisfaction should still rise further following the adjustments made to culture... so may have a look to see what effect an education programme has...


[16-Apr-25 03:08 AM] evov#0000
Yea it looks like it should be safe for the week and on the right path.


[16-Apr-25 03:10 AM] evov#0000
That Safety station is MAXED out though haha.


[16-Apr-25 03:11 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, start to have real shitty options if you want more safety... it's maxed and already is being filled with all three upkeep goods.


[16-Apr-25 03:13 AM] akyantor#0000
It's one of the reasons why I'd have wanted to avoid a general festivities as growing unutilised PIO/SET is not helpful at all.. but due to lack of culture satifisfaction there wasn't a choice, education programme wasn't enough to keep ENG in good order.


[16-Apr-25 03:13 AM] akyantor#0000
I hope the most recent changes to culture will be enough that an education programme will be enough from next week onwards.


[16-Apr-25 03:15 AM] akyantor#0000
Just waiting for the popr report to feed through to my copy of Archiel's sheet to find out.


[16-Apr-25 03:15 AM] evov#0000
Unfortunately, if you don't beef up Safety with some of the less desirable options, it'll end up capping all your other fulfilments ( comfort/culture/education ). Not an imediate problem, but it's a a problem that could take time to resolve ( takes time to source building materials for some of those buildings, and a lot of the upkeep goods for those 2 aren't exactly commonly traded goods imo )

The model last week had it not capping either culture or comfort, while getting ENG into the 50%+ range of satisfaction.

[16-Apr-25 03:18 AM] akyantor#0000
So may be ok without going down the drone station route, but it depends a lot on if the ENG demand keeps growing...


[16-Apr-25 03:19 AM] akyantor#0000
It's not near reaching the true happy right now, as there was an unfortunate gap in culture upkeep goods. I've built out a solid supply now, so will avoid that in future.


[16-Apr-25 03:58 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, looks like an education programme next time might be sufficient. The forecast (removing the benefit of the festivals programme from this week) shows a 60 ENG increase when running education 3, even without the benefit of culture satisfaction continuing to grow.


[16-Apr-25 03:58 AM] akyantor#0000
There's also a modest growth expected even without that programme 20 ENG.

[16-Apr-25 03:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I've now topped off all of the required popi upkeep goods, so now just to maintain the stocks. The planet currently owes me around 2m AIC, with around 1m AIC in cash available. The good news is the tax increase has already had a noticable effect. I think it's tracking to be closer to 1.1m income this week, which is a lot closer to meeting the costs.


[19-Apr-25 05:11 PM] akyantor#0000

I guess I'll be able to reduce Deimos taxes again... by how much who knows... will have to remodel the best goods to maintain the upkeep. I suspect the education boost will help quite a bit.


[23-Apr-25 10:34 AM] akyantor#0000
I think I'm out of the woods on ENG pops now... 8.7% unemployed. Minded to see what happens when the education programme expires as I suspect it'll be stable if not moderately growing still, which would be perfect:

I'm not going to touch taxes again until the balance patch hits, as the costs should reduce quite a lot.
