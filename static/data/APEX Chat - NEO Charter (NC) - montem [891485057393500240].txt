**Fuyutsuki**:	Two POLs built


[27-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	I'm getting worried we might soon oversaturate the PG market


[27-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Jacuribu is quitting


[27-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's why the POLs are being built


[27-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	oh wait what?


[27-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep


[27-Sep-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	POLs and LABs


[27-Sep-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Someone should go settle that AR GG he's on


[27-Sep-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that's going to REALLY suck


[27-Sep-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	Quitting the game, or quitting making more chem buildings?


[27-Sep-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The game


[27-Sep-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	oh, that's going to put a dent in things.  Yeah nvm put those POLs up, I'll put some more up too

**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean he stopped brining in AR weeks ago


[27-Sep-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's why I bought like 200 of it


[27-Sep-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	lol @ the "golden DW"


[27-Sep-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lol I just s aw that too


[27-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I know that's a custom contract, but man it's funny to see


[27-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	150k for one DW!


[27-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's mighty e xpensive


[27-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm assuming it's the other side of the 5,000 PG


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	5000 pg would have to be valued at 30 for it to be even


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm not sure


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but not a bad guess


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	could also be payment for a ship


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	could be.


[27-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Glass Engines


[27-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That PG sell I just put up will be ready in 10 hours


[27-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If anyone is considering it


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm going to try and snipe a bid at 18.25 on the cx


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	over the next few days as I start to acquire PG


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Do you just want a regular rate?


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	perhaps - give me a couple days to finish my pp2 buildout and know what my actual production\consumption rates will be


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a little early


[27-Sep-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I will be a regular buyer of PG, yes

[27-Sep-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	haha I saw the msg


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I stand by the 18/u price pending market shenanigans.


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I don't think I can buy two plants


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well not full time, no.


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	maybe one - cause I'll be doing PWO\OVE\LSE


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'll keep that in mind thx


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	NP


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would be interested @18


[27-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	give me maybe 2-3 days?


[27-Sep-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	No rush


[27-Sep-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	& I can probably guarantee 150\day


[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's about 1 plant with no experts


[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I run two so I will always be able to fulfill your needs


[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	depends on the LSE market :D


[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but ok cool, thanks


[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll just kind of stock it up for now


[27-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	in 2hr HB1, HB2, CHP get built - tomorrow is PP2


[27-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would want to do a more formal delivery schedule if you want to do long-term commitments so that you're never missing materials when you need them


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I'm just getting started & am cash poor - so I'm hesitant to get things rolling until I have reliable income. need to start selling the bfabs again before I do anything


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The way I have conventionally done those is with BUYs that you post with staggered delivery dates and I discount the PG by the ad prices


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that works for me


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and you know I don't mind fronting materials and awaiting payment


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you and I have done this already.


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	3 day, 7 day, 12 day, 14 day.


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or something


[27-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yeah, its according to your needs.


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	👍


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I don't know (and technically don't want / need to know) your plans


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to be honest, neither do I, they're always changing 🤣


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and that's why staggered BUYs are the best way to do stuff like this


[27-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok

**lowstrife**:	my current buildout plan to get more or less finished with this planet


[27-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Looks like a good plan


[27-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	WPL is optional - not sure if that's going here or verdant


[27-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Don't spread your experts out too far


[27-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=)


[27-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	3rd construction expert arriving any day now...


[27-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I'm trying to spread and build as many different things to take advantage of as many different markets as possible


[27-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to keep cashflow reasonable


[27-Sep-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so this should be fun


[27-Sep-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	When I gave you those ads, I forgot to get MCG for two of my buildings... then I bought MCG for one of my two... xD


[28-Sep-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RamenTheKid**:	hey if I accept a shipping contract, am I the one doing the shipping, or is someone going to ship what I give them?


[28-Sep-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	The person who posts the ad is always giving the goods to be shipped.


[28-Sep-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RamenTheKid**:	ahhhh I see


[28-Sep-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RamenTheKid**:	I thought I was allowing someone to use my ship lol


[28-Sep-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	There’s no way to post available shipping space on your ship. You need to announce on char, and see who puts up ads.


[28-Sep-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RamenTheKid**:	well, I have a shipment to make. Anyone need anything sent to moria station? I got 400m3/200t room left.


[28-Sep-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	*announce on chat* - like you just did.


[28-Sep-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RamenTheKid**:	nice lol


[28-Sep-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Hollo**:	also on UFO discord planet chat (or region chat or whatever is appropriate for your route)


[28-Sep-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll pre-sell them at 830 each if anyone wants the whole lot


[28-Sep-21 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Looking for some STL


[28-Sep-21 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Manfriendly**:	I have a fair bit, but bought it when it was above 9 so I'd have to sell it for 10 - are you desperate enough? :P


[28-Sep-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	he is talking about steel not fuel


[28-Sep-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Manfriendly**:	ah nvm


[28-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	@smartdog when you say some, how much do you mean?


[28-Sep-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	STL = Steel, SF = STL Fuel


[28-Sep-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The acronyms are bad


[28-Sep-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I've definitely made that mistake multiple times


[28-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Heh Should've made sure that was clear :p I'll buy up to 30


[28-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	gotcha


[28-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I'm buying 30 STL for 10 as well :p


[28-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	ah yes, 30 STL for 10 is a pretty good deal


[28-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but you could probably talk it down to 9.75 if you tried


[28-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	9.99


[28-Sep-21 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Priority shipping request from CX -> Planet. Paying 10 NCC / T,M3 (it's H2O so it has the same weight/density).


[28-Sep-21 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Ad is already up


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	20% off AEF for the next 6 hours on the Moria CX!

[28-Sep-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Yeah, give me 1 min


[28-Sep-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	+5.5% safety this week


[28-Sep-21 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	0% unemployment among pioneers, wow


[29-Sep-21 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Yeah, I'm at 79% because of it.


[29-Sep-21 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	For clarification, that number includes luxury consumables. 79/100 solely because of lack of workers.


[29-Sep-21 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Guess you can only go so far with a single SST


[29-Sep-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm still at 640\640 thankfully


[29-Sep-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I won't be able to build anything this week, which puts a big wrench in my plans


[29-Sep-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I didn't expect it to drop to zero


[29-Sep-21 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	I'm at 1,778/2,250


[29-Sep-21 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Guess that's what I get for building late


[29-Sep-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I lost 6 techs this week...


[29-Sep-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	eh... if you have that many pioneers and there's unemployment you'd lose some even if you started at full employment


[29-Sep-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The amount of unnecessary promotions to settlers is kinda annoying.


[29-Sep-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Montem needs more pioneers and is good on settlers.  They're even under 50% happiness.


[29-Sep-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	1000 promote anyway.


[29-Sep-21 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	They're highly necessary if those pioneers ever want to get some of that ALE one day

**lowstrife**:	yeah the promotion system is... strange


[29-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but to me it makes sense because you need to grow each pop base by a lot


[29-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Was the park fully operational this week?


[29-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so moving up regularly I guess works


[29-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes, comfort went up by 12%


[29-Sep-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tho I'm not sure if that was the full week's stats


[29-Sep-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The park was not fully opperational.  DECs were never supplied.


[29-Sep-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	DW always was, FOD and PFE mostly were.


[29-Sep-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	SOI mostly wasn't.


[29-Sep-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So maybe 3 goods worth overall?


[29-Sep-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Out of 5.


[29-Sep-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	But the comfort boost was quite substantial, since it lags.  Previous weeks count aas well.


[29-Sep-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Still only 12.5% is pretty pitiful :(


[29-Sep-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ah


[29-Sep-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Assume it will go up by lik 3-4x.


[29-Sep-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Still... I have fewer techs than I did two weeks ago


[29-Sep-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Three even


[29-Sep-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I think the 571 open jobs has more to do with that than the lack of comfort.


[29-Sep-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Weekly growth is tied for the highest it's ever been.


[29-Sep-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	for some reason people saw the all those open jobs for Techs and still decided to build more tech buildings


[29-Sep-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, but it's further behind demand


[29-Sep-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean if it's their first tech building, why not, they'll steal some of our techs


[29-Sep-21 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	We need some non-compete clauses in their contracts


[29-Sep-21 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	loool


[29-Sep-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have no plans for techs... for now. but it's the tradgedy of the commons in terms of pop allocation


[29-Sep-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	people are better off if nobody goes over the limit


[29-Sep-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but every person hurts only a little bit if one more person adds


[29-Sep-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tricky thing to balance


[29-Sep-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I wonder if tax rates per pop type would help


[29-Sep-21 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lower taxes on pioneers, higher taxes on techs


[29-Sep-21 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Looks like we have 794 unfilled pioneer jobs now.


[29-Sep-21 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have changed my CoGC vote to settlers

**Rubicate**:	oh, ouch, we are a bit short on pioneers already


[29-Sep-21 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	we clearly need to build more safety stations


[29-Sep-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hang on... catfiz claimed to be at 1778/2250.... that seems like more than the open number of jobs?


[29-Sep-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm maxed 640\640


[29-Sep-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I build buildings last period


[29-Sep-21 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Only people with super high numbers of pioneers will be short or people who build something after the report


[29-Sep-21 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so say I need to build one more PIO building


[29-Sep-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if I build it just before the next pio report


[29-Sep-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what happens?


[29-Sep-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	currently I'm only able to get 1 pioneer allocated from the reserve


[29-Sep-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	do I get a chunk from the next immigration as well?


[29-Sep-21 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You will get a chunk of next week's redistribution


[29-Sep-21 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Someone told me you only keep 75% of your workforce, then all the new/freed up workers are distributed round-robin


[29-Sep-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Effectively that means if someone is trying to employ 1000+ pioneers, they will probably be short a lot, while someone at under 500 won't be short any


[29-Sep-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The only downside is the shortage between reports


[29-Sep-21 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I fired like half my pioneers this round


[29-Sep-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok gotcha


[29-Sep-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so someone adding one building won't be hurt particularly bad


[29-Sep-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(which is me, I only need one more PIO building then my base is done with pioneers)


[29-Sep-21 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	settlers only


[29-Sep-21 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I lost 77 pioneers. I was planning to add more pioneer buildings today, but I guess that's out the BTA


[29-Sep-21 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	net change of 5087 pio jobs last week


[29-Sep-21 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow


[29-Sep-21 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	And it's not likely to get better next report :D


[29-Sep-21 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Funny enough I didn't lose any pop and actually gained techs


[29-Sep-21 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	indeed, we gotta prioritize fixing that


[29-Sep-21 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Leave my techs alone you monster xD


[29-Sep-21 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	although our pio happiness is above 70% so it should see growth as well


[29-Sep-21 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	the potential danger is that people's bases grow faster


[29-Sep-21 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	How many techs do you have?


[29-Sep-21 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	138


[29-Sep-21 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah


[29-Sep-21 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm going to have to steal someone's techs on Vallis I guess


[29-Sep-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Steal our pios too :p


[29-Sep-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have 6 SME there


[29-Sep-21 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I actually employ more pioneers on Vallis now


[29-Sep-21 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Lmao


[29-Sep-21 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm down to 190 pios here


[29-Sep-21 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I literally employ more techs on Montem than pioneers


[29-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'm getting to that point lol


[29-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I have other worlds where I employ lots of pios


[29-Sep-21 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	Have you not seen the population expanding rapidly? My occasional random musings about the efficiency of using INS and HSEs to make bfabs?


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was even going to move my WEL there, but... I don't really need to free up space for even more techs here


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow what a planet


[29-Sep-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	one jump away too


[29-Sep-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, just need to sell off your first born child to afford to put up a base there


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tough though because you have to ship in carbon\oxygen


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I guess even consumables


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Or you know... build your own "temporary" TNP


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which drains all your other tech buildings with its high labor demands


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It takes relatively little in and in theory less out, but I built it back when LST was expensive so I overbuilt the EXT


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now I have to go there often just to empty it out


[29-Sep-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I still consume LST on most of my other bases


[29-Sep-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, not so much on Montem lately


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but the LST shipments to Verdant are critical


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what consumes LST? NS?


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	on verdant


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	& I'm thinking medium term about setting up carbon farming there


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	is that a good or bad idea


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or should I try and find somewhere closer with more oxygen


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	err, more water


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, NS


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean you might want somewhere closer just because C is heavy


[29-Sep-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	XG-326d is so alluring


[29-Sep-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for COF


[29-Sep-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So, it's actually worse than Verdant


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The water is frozen


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	1 RIG takes 10 area and 30 pioneers, 1 EXT takes 25 area and 60


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh you use EXT to mine water from frozen planets


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	interesting


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so the real prod rate is half


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	All cold planets have frozen water


[29-Sep-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what about DW-739d


[29-Sep-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh


[29-Sep-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	also frozen


[29-Sep-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	See how it says Mineral next to water?


[29-Sep-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Liquid > Gas > Mineral in terms of ease of extraction


[29-Sep-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	forsure


[29-Sep-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Do any planets have liquid iron?


[29-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what about liquid bfabs


[29-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and lfabs


[29-Sep-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You could drink them


[29-Sep-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	hmm, it seems there are no planets with liquid ore of any kind actually. somewhat depressing now that the idea has been planted.


[29-Sep-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	yeah


[29-Sep-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cause it requires a lot of carbon


[29-Sep-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	might have to ship it in from Promitor then


[29-Sep-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Especially if we are gonna build several Safety Stations to help the pioneer problem, we kinda need there to be some OFF production :D


[29-Sep-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	montem --> HRT departing in 16-36hr, can be flexible for you 470/470 available


[29-Sep-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I am willing to build OFF production chain - but it will probably take me a month to get there


[29-Sep-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or more - no idea how long. am willing to work long-term


[29-Sep-21 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I will also be doing montem --> BEN in 3-5 days, similar capacity available.


[29-Sep-21 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I can get 100 OFF ready within a couple of days. I can do more in the long term, but it was not on my radar.


[29-Sep-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	someone needs to step in and help cover the giant POL hole that was left by Jacu


[29-Sep-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I’ll be adding CHP/POL capacity, but not immediately, and not exactly in enough size to fill the hole…


[29-Sep-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	There’s probably a lot of other new players looking at expanding. Some of them have probably been digging around the settler techs, and see the need for PG.


[29-Sep-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	eventually I want to make a dedicated planet nearby for PG\EPO


[29-Sep-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	on-site carbon farming


[29-Sep-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	easy to ship


[29-Sep-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Hi Montem, your governor here. I want to apologize for my failure to keep the pioneer population up to our local demand. To be honest it kinda caught us by surprise, this was never an issue in the previous universe, you always had too many pioneers there.


[29-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I will be raising the tax level a bit more to effectively deal with this as quickly as possible, right now the funds are being eaten up by expensive upkeeps for CoGC, Wildlife Park and Safety Station. But we clearly need to build more Safety Stations, and give them upkeeps as well, if we want to avoid a shrinking Pioneer population.


[29-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Rubicate - I'd suggest acting hard and aggressively on this.


[29-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I promise that the moment the situation is under control, I will lower the tax rate to the exact level where it 1:1 pays for our weekly upkeep costs


[29-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'd suggest raising taxes to mroe than you think you need and act fast. We can always draw down later.


[29-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah


[29-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just curious - how much does a SST cost to build vs. upkeep?


[29-Sep-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	is the initial build quite expensive, so in comparison, you need to raise a lot of funds to get it done


[29-Sep-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	thanks for dropping in and saying hi btw 👋


[29-Sep-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	upkeep is hard to say because barely anybody makes the commodities so prices are so random, but the cost to make one isn't as bad as the Wildlife Park as it only takes B-fabs and not HAB units


[29-Sep-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	The cost to all of us if we hit 10% or 20% unemployment is substantially higher than a tax of 30-50 per unit per day


[29-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Agreed


[29-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I have raised taxes to 30


[29-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	taxes are currently 1% of my profit margin - not a huge issue for me. I'm in support of getting the infrastructure that's needed


[29-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I will finance the new SSTs myself with a zero-interest loan to Montem, as it was my fault that didn't prioritize them earlier


[29-Sep-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	🥂


[29-Sep-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Thanks. The Population report really swung wildly this week.


[29-Sep-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I believe you buy the goods through the CX!


[29-Sep-21 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	… CX*?* So that’s where to put supply?


[29-Sep-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah, you are correct, I buy from the CX


[29-Sep-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	How many are you building?


[29-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I think I will build 2 more so we have 3 in total


[29-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	You sure that's enough?


[29-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	OK. On my side, I’ll look theough the maintenance requirements, and see what I can supply.


[29-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	OFF is the one I'm struggling to find sellers for


[29-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If


[29-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If I had not shipped my EPO off, I could run some off now. Will have to do a return trip.


[29-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	I'm sure we could just do a shipping contract

**Rubicate**:	@Catfiz, yeah, pretty sure


[29-Sep-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I'


[29-Sep-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I suspect 2 SSTs would be enough but we are going for 3 just to be safe


[29-Sep-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HawkyTom**:	I didn't realize there was a demand for OFF because i never see any requests to buy/sell so i figured it was too risky of a market to try and get involved in as a newer player... i would have to buy both PG/EPO to make the OFF


[29-Sep-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	that's fair enough, there weren't actually much of an OFF demand before this in the first place


[29-Sep-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HawkyTom**:	How many does montem need and how often? And how much would be a fair price for them? I might try to make some to help oit, but dont want to bankrupt myself in the process... lol


[29-Sep-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	We are looking at needing 90 OFF every 3 days or so


[29-Sep-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	as for price, I honestly don't know, 50? 75? 100?


[29-Sep-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	so basically 30/day


[29-Sep-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah


[29-Sep-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HawkyTom**:	Thanks for the info, ill try to help with the supply as much i can


[29-Sep-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Prom has 4 SSTs and pioneers are still going down


[29-Sep-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Our pio happiness level is inherently higher than theirs, something about how bases are filled I suppose


[29-Sep-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	safety went from 90% to 67.5% in one week


[29-Sep-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for prom


[29-Sep-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	report #25\26


[29-Sep-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's why they're declining


[29-Sep-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm not sure what happened there


[29-Sep-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	safety upticked this week... I think they also are having supply issues with the SST


[29-Sep-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Hmm, that was a month ago


[29-Sep-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	I wonder what the issue was


[29-Sep-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Ah, montem had the same thing happen 92% to 68.


[29-Sep-21 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Catfiz**:	Seems that was a week we got hit hard by the changes


[29-Sep-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I thought that was in June


[29-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	gah what do I know


[29-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	Promitor needs about 5k more safety than Montem, based on their population


[29-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	0.25/pioneer, 0.3/sett, 0.2/tech, 0.1/eng --> so i see Montem needs about 42k.  the 400 bases are supplying 20k.  and a fully stocked SST = 2500 so that's 53.4%


[29-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	but not sure how the phase in works


[29-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	(i.e. was SST fully stocked whole week and when does it start giving the full 2500)


[29-Sep-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	On the OFF question, there’s currently a big slug of supply (590) from “Awkward People” that’s capping the price. That can be used to meet near run supply, by anyone with a BMP. The problem is more when that overhang disappears. 90 OFF/day is chewing up most of a low expert POL’s production (unless my memory is faulty). Now that there’s a known demand, if nobody else fills the gap, even I could do it after some lead time.


[29-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Sigh. 8 LBH’s is a lot of AL.


[29-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pleinair**:	I have 12 LBH, 20 LDE, 24 LSE, 16 LTA unused right now :)


[29-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pleinair**:	not for sale btw


[29-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	When the changes were being phased in us actually seeing the effects was delayed by a week (when it would be dropped again) which could be why safety dropped so fast


[29-Sep-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Pios also get deleted with coliq now so they shouldn't get as crazy as last uni


[29-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pleinair**:	don't talk about last uni's populous mechanics


[29-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Otherwise I could have just made OFF on a whim


[29-Sep-21 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the downside of specialization I guess


[29-Sep-21 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I could run OFF and split profits with you


[29-Sep-21 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**skaterror**:	hi everyone, im very new here, and i've started with a farmstead. is that the best to do in this planet or am i just wasting my time ?. im progressing slow and i dont know if its meant to be this way


[29-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I would funny enough recommend making Carbon


[29-Sep-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	that's exactly what im planning to do. ive done some math and 2 farmstead 1 incinerator and 2 rigs will make the trick for now


[29-Sep-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	is that a good way to start, or something to aim at at this moment ?


[29-Sep-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I would skip out on the RIGs and just buy the water


[29-Sep-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	H2O.NC1 isn't all that bad


[29-Sep-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah the price of a rig is around 20000 ncc so it would take some water to make it worth


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	and should i then do another incinerator ?


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yup


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Carbon has been on the rise over the last few weeks, so there is good money there


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	nice


[29-Sep-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	but for an incinerator i would need how much?, i also need more pioneers if im not mistaken


[29-Sep-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	so i need to save a little


[29-Sep-21 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I'm not sure of the ratios myself, that is something you might have to figure out yourself.


[29-Sep-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	will do


[29-Sep-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	thank you !!!


[29-Sep-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	no problem


[29-Sep-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	oh one more question, can my incinerator work with 30 pioneers instead of 40 ?


[29-Sep-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yup, but at a reduced efficiency


[29-Sep-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	is it too bad ?


[29-Sep-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Honestly we will problaby have some deficit of pioneers next week as well, the players of Montem are expanding every week faster than our pioneers are growing


[30-Sep-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but with our increased Safety stat the growth of Pioneers will drastically rise and we'll start meeting demand soon enough

[30-Sep-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I should have my first shipment of OFF hitting the CX in four days, possibly behind other people. Should be no issue covering Montem’s needs (unless HAL completely dries up).


[30-Sep-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	probably 7


[30-Sep-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	still a small starting base of settlers


[30-Sep-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I can do 7. CX pricing has a wide bid/ask, but I’ll do it at mid (300/u). I’ll let you put up the ad. I’m down to my last one myself, so I would need to produce them.


[30-Sep-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I don't need 7 right away, even 5 is fine if you want a buffer


[30-Sep-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Or we can contract them for a few days out if you want to make a few batches


[30-Sep-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I can have a production run of 10 finished in 20hr


[30-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ahh gotcha


[30-Sep-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nocknuck**:	oh no he is a puppet


[30-Sep-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	an ilusion of choice


[30-Sep-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	PART OF THE SYSTEM


[30-Sep-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	DOD is running? Welp sorry Rubi...


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	I resent these accusations.  I'm not with Rubi, I'm just not against him.


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I like my illusion of choice, damnit


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	trust no one


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Not even Nocknuck


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	The fact that I'm voting for Rubi and he's voting for me is mere coincidence


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	these liars and demons here to deceive us


[30-Sep-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	to rule us


[30-Sep-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	open our eyes before they close them for ever


[30-Sep-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I read a sci-fi short story a long time ago where the leader was not elected, but chosen by a computer algorithm as being the best at that job. The people chosen were forced to lead whether they wanted to or not. The older I get, the more that system appeals to me.


[30-Sep-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I love the idea... except: Who write the algorithm?


[30-Sep-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Qui custodiet ipsos custodes?  :)


[30-Sep-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	You better not use that to think that just because I don't want the job means that I'd be good at it...


[30-Sep-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**genveir**:	assuming your algorithm works well it's fine of course, but it has to optimize on something, and I'd be curious to know what the algorithm sees as the optimal leader


[30-Sep-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Who watches the watchers... yup


[30-Sep-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Maybe it could just be a self learning algorithm... nah you still have to teach those


[30-Sep-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**genveir**:	even if it's self-learning, what is its goal? What makes a leader good? Optimal profits for the own citizenry? Best standard of living? The person who will make society depend on algorithms the most? (If it's the latter I see how they got to this point)


[30-Sep-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**genveir**:	you'll need some kind of fitness function for the algorithm to optimize against


[30-Sep-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Gotta be the latter. Cause you know, evil AI

[30-Sep-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	Maybe it has on-file peoples' personalities/IQ/skills and determines based off of their traits who would be least likely to turn corrupt or let the power go to their head, combined with whether or not the person would be competent at basic administrative/governing tasks


[30-Sep-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	There's a wonderful interpretation of the Basilisk theory I read on reddit a while ago


[30-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it was very very good. I wish I could find it

**SmartDog**:	Montem: Runs out of pios


[30-Sep-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Also Montem: Hail Rubi!


[30-Sep-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Don't me wrong I like them as a person I just disagree with their governing style


[30-Sep-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what should montem be?


[30-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'd prefer being more proactive with POPI because of the time involved but there are tools now to calculate needs


[30-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	run for governer if you disagree


[30-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	if you get elected then you can say you were right


[30-Sep-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'm just stating my preference. Montem prefers minimal everything :P


[30-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	i think the govt should fulfil the needs of the buildings people build


[30-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if there's demand for "x" population, should work to fulfill it


[30-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	Rubi did exactly that when even the moves he was making for safety turned out not actually to be enough


[30-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	made the move for techs with the wildlife park


[30-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I'm 33 days into this game and know nothing


[30-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'd prefer to have some buffer as most of the others do. We won't get the safety until after the next report


[30-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	11%, 7%, 5%, -1%


[30-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	was the unemployment for pioneers


[30-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it did happen pretty quickly fwiw


[30-Sep-21 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	And POPI stuff is slow


[30-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Check out the reports for Vallis it also quickly dropped but there was already a lvl 2 SST so it's still stable


[30-Sep-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	someone's gotta buildup the scientists


[30-Sep-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so that the 7 people who will be able to afford the FTL ships can get FTL ships lol


[30-Sep-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I think it would be easier to build more than needed and undersupply the buildings


[30-Sep-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I know Proxion is going for sci and I think Phobos?


[30-Sep-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	prox is yeah


[30-Sep-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I don't expect to see any of the other starters push for it though


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there's another planet that has a broadcasting hub I think


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	someone else is trying


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	prom?


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	no


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	prox


[30-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	It would be easiest / fastest to grow higher pops on those big planets too


[30-Sep-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	sure?


[30-Sep-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Yes a bigger tech pop means more engi growth


[30-Sep-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah but in terms of like demographic growth and also supplying the expensive popi infrastructure


[30-Sep-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	not cheap


[30-Sep-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Oh I meant in terms of getting the actual pop. There has been some changes there at least lol


[30-Sep-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	so i had a medium sized expansion scheduled in an hours time, but reading all this im not sure weather its worth building 4 pio buildings now when theres no workers to fill them. what do?


[30-Sep-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah people are making moves. the universe is still young, yeah


[30-Sep-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	we want instant results damnit!


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	datacollector when you're looking at your production buildings, there is a number in parenthesis of the number of pioneers that will be allocated to you


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it should be (1)


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	instant results for instant gratification


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so yeah, it's not best to build pio right now


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	There's a very good chance you'll still get your pios. Iirc everyone returns 25% of their workforce which is then distributed round robin style


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	DataCollector - build the buildings closer to the next POPR release.


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	^


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Not everyone lost PIO... yet


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	oh okay thanks


[30-Sep-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I kept all of mine


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	plus we'll have a good inflow of migration - hopefully - next cycle


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	at least we ended above 70%


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it will grow next cycle


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	That number you see in the construct menu is how many you can get right now. The pop repoprt for the planet will do the actual distribution


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I also didn’t lose any - but my PIO population is small.


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	same


[30-Sep-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	@lowstrife We still had a net loss


[30-Sep-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	dang yeah i see all the 1s


[30-Sep-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	dang settler educations!


[30-Sep-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Why would people educate themselves into unemployment?


[30-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	the simulation becomes more realistic once again


[30-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	lmfao


[30-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	lol


[30-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hahaha that's a good one


[30-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	looool


[30-Sep-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the government doing a spending spree right before the election, workers educating themselves into unemployment, supplychains starting to breakdown because of a lack of shipping capacity


[30-Sep-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	🙄


[30-Sep-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	all we need now is fuel prices to go up


[30-Sep-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Ouch.


[30-Sep-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Still waiting on that stuck ship blocking trade


[30-Sep-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	europe folks are about to get hit really hard by that


[30-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	this is going to be a rough winter


[30-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	wait is there another stuck ship?


[30-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There's another stuck ship?


[30-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	They meant fuel prices lol


[30-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	ah ok ok


[30-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	thought i was never gonna get that gpu


[30-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Just something I thought would be funny for a prun event


[30-Sep-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	'Ship blocks FTL path to Hortus'


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	debris field in the jump zone


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	heh


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	They totally should do random space events


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	a scavenger hunt


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	*the space kraken lashes your cargo ship for 30% damage*


[30-Sep-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	lmao


[30-Sep-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	*your workers are rattled, +5% consumables consumption*


[30-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the blocked ship should be called the Everinhibition


[30-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and you have to go through BEN to get from MOR to HRT


[30-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	*to show benten some love*


[30-Sep-21 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Okay satan


[30-Sep-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	lmao


[30-Sep-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Pop out 20 jumps away from a CX on the other side of the universe xD


[30-Sep-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol, how much would you pay for a rescue?


[30-Sep-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	thats the image i saw


[30-Sep-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	just coliq at that point


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	lol Towing would be interesting


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Ah depends... Somebody might bring fuel for 15-20k


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	thing is if they added that there would be a community for it


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Tow truck operator


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Why not


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	rescue missions, towing etc


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Can you refuel from your cargo when stationary?


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And the business model is based on the random events


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yes you can


[30-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Move it from Cargo to fuel tank


[30-Sep-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There's a far out GG run I need to take fuel with me or I wouldn't make it back


[30-Sep-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... so you'd have to just carry tons of FF with you at all times


[30-Sep-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Little reserve, just in case


[30-Sep-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	im wondering if its viable to never set up buildings and just run a shipping company, do people do that?


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Rain did in the beginning


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Some people did that with trade


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, not shipping other people's stuff, but trading


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But he seems to have come to the conclusion that a base is easier money in the long run


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	its not my playstyle just wondering if it happens


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I had some pretty profitable runs recently... but ships would need to be cheaper for it to be worth it


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	the trading makes sens


[30-Sep-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	To just ship stuff


[30-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, it's so risky


[30-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	yeah youd need to get more ships quick


[30-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've had runs where my cargo lost 33% of its value while in flight


[30-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	dang


[30-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	like all the BBH the other day


[30-Sep-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	unrealized value*


[30-Sep-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah, markets move fast sometimes


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In my case it was C coming back from Hortus


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm waiting for something to arrive today, so far things haven't moved against me which is fortunate


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or that time they nerfed the HE MM


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I managed to get a shitload of PE under 3.50, which considering the price of carbon, I can't believe people are selling down there


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it looks like people have stopped making\selling it


[30-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so I expect a spike soon


[30-Sep-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	yeah i dont get shitloads but catch the 3.50 PE a few times


[30-Sep-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	2nd and 3rd order effects... BDE already impacted


[30-Sep-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fabs probably have enough supply to be okay


[30-Sep-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	can't really make anything else so I think most people will just continue on making them regardless


[30-Sep-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	so carbons getting worse?


[30-Sep-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	my friend just liquidated from carbon to do smelters rip


[30-Sep-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... I might need to re-consider the idea of building a C base


[30-Sep-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	might be worth it supply/demand is 1:2


[30-Sep-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Just I've been selling too much my MHL :(


[30-Sep-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	still learning some of the tickers wish you could search for them


[30-Sep-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	whats an MHL


[30-Sep-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Metal Hallide Lighting


[30-Sep-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	way beyond my scope lmao


[30-Sep-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Devoting an entire base to one commodity is risky. One alternative some people use is throw in an INC and buy crops.


[30-Sep-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I set up a second base on Verdant to raise cash crops, including C. But I figure that would be less than half the base,so I can put another industry in there.


[30-Sep-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	If I can reliably source C elsewhere cheaper, I can shrink the agricultural part of the base.


[30-Sep-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	you can search for them: MAT MHL


[30-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	amazing thank you hollo


[30-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... I think I can consume 30 C per day


[30-Sep-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My needs are smaller, but C is my largest single daily expenditure (although DW+RAT together are a bit larger).


[30-Sep-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	humm i make 55ish a day (C that is)


[30-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	hi why do i have 171 workers 180 required and a capacity of 200


[30-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	i demolished a rig that had 30 workers, is that why

**Paulrik4444**:	is it maybe a population infrastructure thing? You might see that number change when the next pop report comes out.


[30-Sep-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	find somewhere you can click on Montem to get the planetary report

[30-Sep-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	then go look at the population report


[30-Sep-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tl;dr we're short workers


[30-Sep-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	next week it should be a lot better (hopefully)


[30-Sep-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Somewhat better, the two additional levels of safety station won't kick in until the week after.


[30-Sep-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh really


[30-Sep-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there's some good news


[30-Sep-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[30-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So next week could be worse.


[30-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Though only for people who employ a lot of pioneers.


[30-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	*looks around nervously at my 630 pio employment number*


[30-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fine this week... but we'll see


[30-Sep-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	also going to 715 at the end of this week soooo we'll see


[30-Sep-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	@skaterror Um yeah there seems to be a safety issue on Montem... something about the Governor not funding the police err... I mean safety station


[30-Sep-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	No joking aside, everyone is having some issues getting workers due to planetary infrastructure issues


[30-Sep-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	Verdant is *out* of pioneers


[30-Sep-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah everyone realizing the investment that needs to be made


[30-Sep-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	such change - very systemic


[30-Sep-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	verdant needs a lot of action - even though the population is small, they are very dense


[30-Sep-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	avg pio population per base is 30% higher than montem


[30-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup... problem on Verdant is there's no governor to blame. Takes all the fun out of it ^^


[30-Sep-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh really


[30-Sep-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	then who built the POPI?


[30-Sep-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and seems people fund the COGC


[30-Sep-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	interesting


[30-Sep-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Players did. Probably corps. Probably SNF was involved. Don't know for sure it was before my time


[30-Sep-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah SF contributes half of the upkeep


[30-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that'll do it


[30-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So did the devs make some kind of POPI changes? This seems to be sneaking up on everyone everywhere


[30-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah a while ago they made huge changes


[30-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	basically each base contributes an ammount to the planets safety


[30-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they nerf'd the shit out of it, actually requiring people to build POPI


[30-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and it takes a while for those changes to trickle down sinec there is averraging applied


[30-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh okay, and it just took a while to catch up. Funny how Montem and Verdant have the issue at the same time


[30-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Even Vallis got close, but Stelio pulled out all the stops. Looks like they'll be fine there


[30-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they're still dropping safety %


[30-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah they also deployed heavy hitters


[30-Sep-21 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gonads**:	MON > MOR 1/2 ship available. 2 day burn. Depart 15 mins


[30-Sep-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tbh I'd spend the extra 10 SF fuel


[30-Sep-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and save the day


[30-Sep-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	57 sf --> 67sf shaves like 20hr off of the time


[30-Sep-21 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just my 2c


[30-Sep-21 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I did the reverse trip in about 8h


[30-Sep-21 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You can always burn more SF... this message brought to you by Big SF.


[30-Sep-21 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lol


[30-Sep-21 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gonads**:	i got time :)


[30-Sep-21 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah, my ships sometimes need to make multiple trips in a day or at least get there in time to be sent off on their next trip

[30-Sep-21 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I've had to juggle some fast transfer times while the planets are far apart


[30-Sep-21 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but at least SF is cheap


[30-Sep-21 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm getting filled in the 6.xx\u all the time


[30-Sep-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gonads**:	the difference is 57 vs 83 SF


[30-Sep-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the less fuel you have in your tank the more granular adjustments you can make


[30-Sep-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and really fine-tune the consumption


[30-Sep-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gonads**:	ooo never knew that


[30-Sep-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I keep a SF buffer at moria


[30-Sep-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and only have 300-500sf in my ships at any one time

[01-Oct-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Uh oh.  No DDT anywhere and no one is taking my ads.


[01-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll raise my price on the LM.


[01-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	But I'm about to run out of DDT and won't be able to keep making herbs for KOM.


[01-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@lowstrife as long as you reach the funds around the date, I have no problems with the PG being "fronted"


[01-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I want this to be relatively stress free


[01-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	👍 thx


[01-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I'm going through spending all the money on inputs atm


[01-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it won't be hard to have a few thousand in sales in the next 5 days, providing nothing else unforseen comes up


[01-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the lack of pioneers are really going to bottleneckt he 4th smelter I needed to build


[01-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**skaterrorftw**:	how can you optimize better the travel of your fleet ? are there like orbiting periods ?


[01-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	the planets do orbit and you could wait until they're closer to your destination, yes


[01-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterrorftw**:	oh great, is there anywhere i can read about the orbit speeds or that is not documented anywhere ?


[01-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	I don't know about that though. think most people just opt to not care about that, since it usually takes quite a while for them to be in "perfect" position


[01-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	I'm sure *someone* has looked into that though, just don't know who


[01-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah i bet, i was just wondering hahaha


[01-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah it's more of a soft thing, sometimes you can send your ship rapidly back and forth


[01-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterrorftw**:	so it just doesnt make sense to calculate it


[01-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	Moria and Montem line up like every 31 days or so


[01-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and they are in a 2:3 orbital reasonance as best as I can guess


[01-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	You guys should use BUYs


[01-Oct-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	111.66 each would have been a great deal


[01-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That sounds delicious. My INC's are hungry...


[01-Oct-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Guess I'll take 3 at 3k.


[01-Oct-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	That will at least buy me a couple days.


[01-Oct-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	don't pay too much for your coffee, LM price is 310, you won't find cheaper in all of Moria


[01-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	A bit late.


[01-Oct-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That is indeed cheap


[01-Oct-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	We don't have government cheese but we do have government coffee


[01-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I usually blindly buy everything at the CX, since I have to go there anyway.


[01-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I don't even bother checking what's for sale on the LM anymore.


[01-Oct-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	LM is way more efficient than CX


[01-Oct-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Highly recommend it


[01-Oct-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Takes more time to use.


[01-Oct-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Since I plan on probably quitting soon, I just do whatever's fastest and easiest.  Then move on with my day.


[01-Oct-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Just running down my last few days of pro right now.


[01-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	:( I will be sad to see you go


[01-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Legitimately. You have been nice to play this game with


[01-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and another one bites the dust


[01-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	There's just nothing more for me in the game at this stage.


[01-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It needs a universe reset and a proper exploration system.


[01-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've never been in the game for making money.


[01-Oct-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Even after an exploration system is implemented, PU will always be the sorta game where you gotta set your own goals


[01-Oct-21 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Exploration, especially if per-plot surveying or Asteroid Prospecting are introduced will always have content. It's perpetual


[01-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	For context, what I'm hoping for on exploration is mainly asteroid prospecting and jump surveying.


[01-Oct-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	With a universe that starts entirely blocked off except for the routes between starter planets and the CXs.


[01-Oct-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Requiring *all* other jump routes be surveyed collectively by the players.


[01-Oct-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(Once enough time has been spent collectively on the jump survey, anyone can use the route.)


[01-Oct-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I had the plans and materials for a second LAB ready, but... no workers for it :(


[01-Oct-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Does anyone have an MFK on planet they could sell me?


[01-Oct-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or 5?


[01-Oct-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	If I could stay in the game and build a new CX, I'd probably abandon a lot of my existing bases so I could shift most/all of my attention to building up the new hub.


[01-Oct-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Then when that's all setup, I'd tear things down and move onto the next new hub.

[01-Oct-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, my long term goal at this point is to make a WAI


[01-Oct-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-21 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Xenogenic**:	So you can't build a CX... but get a system running and populated, it seems the devs are open to put one in


[02-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You know, if it makes sense


[02-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	CX spamming would be bad... but new functional regions... don't see how the devs would be against that


[02-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	That's way better than I expected.


[02-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Problem still is the actual universe.


[02-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	There's like two regions worth expanding to?


[02-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Have you looked at Outer Heaven/Saladin? I did the research... every resource you could want within 4-5 jumps of TD-203


[02-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Everything needs INS though... the northern wastes are cold lol


[02-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Just need a good producer of THF/INS out there


[02-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well the beauty of it is that it's native to TD-203


[02-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Saladin and HM-049b.


[02-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh I meant HSE


[02-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or whatever it needs


[02-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I think long term OT-113 would be the INS industry


[02-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Regions around Saladin and Ementior are the only ones worth colonizing.


[02-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Both inputs in that system


[02-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Agreed. Kinza is a distant third... can work but only once we have super duper ships


[02-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	They're the only regions that actually have planets with all the core basic resources.


[02-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'm gonna go settle Saladin and TD-203d, and have regular ships going back and forth from Verdant


[02-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Might leave one up there to shuttle stuff around


[02-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Probably will take me a month to get the cash together... but it's on!


[02-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would join you, but I need to stay focused on my goals.


[02-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	only a month? wow


[02-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Getting materials for FTL travel together will only help the outer reaches


[02-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because once we can make our own ships with gargantuan cargo holds, inner rim to reach shipping becomes a real thing


[02-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and if there's a CX at Outer Haveb


[02-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Aren't they giving us 3 months for the contest?


[02-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	well, that's a route I would run


[02-Oct-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	This at least would be something that would justify me sticking with the game.


[02-Oct-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	looks like Fuyu's varrot worked (:


[02-Oct-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	carrot


[02-Oct-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I wouldn't call it that


[02-Oct-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just understand TS's point of view


[02-Oct-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm not renewing pro yet, but I at least won't be tearing down all my production buildings when it runs out.


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If something is fun but loses its luster because there just isn't enough "oomph" to sustain it, that's an issue


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	of course I get it too


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The corp requirement would be a deal breaker for me.


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because you enjoy doing the thing (like we do) but there isn't a good enough motivation to continue


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	What's the point in making all the space dollars if you can't use them to do what you want?


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(Also I think it would be nice if we could make a new faction for this that's themed around the local planets.)


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	e-peen


[02-Oct-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It looks like I can safely produce 7 POLs (for a total of 5 more)


[02-Oct-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would have to buy HCP and GRN in small amounts


[02-Oct-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I would eventually output 930 PG per day


[02-Oct-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	market notwithstanding, I would pin the price at 18 on the planet


[02-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So I just realized this link you gave me isn't searchable. I think they took this down to iron out details. Possibly to assess TS's concern of corp vs non corp


[02-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm a short-term buyer for PG - but I've changed my plans for my 2nd base. It's going to be producing C\PG


[02-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ETA is who fukin knows given the pioneer shortage slowing me down


[02-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I want to do it, but I have no idea if I can convince the higher ups it should be done. It will require a group to do, but maybe those groups can transcend corps


[02-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	2nd base is to tackle my biggest cost - I really wanted to do food\upkeep, but carbon\PG don't look like they'll be improving anytime soon


[02-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But yeah, I realized everyone in corp is already making all the cool stuff, ships are stuck behind WAI... so might as well go settle the outer reaches lol


[02-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I wish there was more incentive to go to the outer reaches


[02-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	aka better planets


[02-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there are some, yes


[02-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I wish there were areas that were intended to be another cx\region


[02-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	maybe there are idk


[02-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but given the shipping limitations, it really dis-incentivizes one to expand wide


[02-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	rather than tall


[02-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	shipbuilding may help with that


[02-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Check the UFO discord lounge. I detailed all the good planets near Saladin/TD-203


[02-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You can reach there from Verdant with current ships


[02-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Just gotta take fuel with you in the hold for a return trip


[02-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	@Fuyutsuki that link was only posted in the special discord channel


[02-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Uh oh, and I posted a message in that thread.


[02-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So it's kinda obvious the link was given away where it shouldn't have been.


[02-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Cat's out of the bag XD


[02-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	not a problem ;) they wanted to get some early feedback before showing it around for everybody but it's not that they don't want to have other see it ;) and they know it will get "leaked"


[02-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	will/was already


[02-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah I heard about it in corp. And the latest devlog had a teaser in it


[02-Oct-21 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Aeryen I kind of figured that it had already been leaked prior to me


[02-Oct-21 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Transparency.


[02-Oct-21 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Anyone want 28 BBH before I start moving it to Moria in like 12 hours from now?


[02-Oct-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Since there has been a lot of talk about Saladin and Outer Heaven lately, contact me if you are seriously interested in setting up a base over there. Me and my group are planning something big, and we can help make sure you have a viable and profitable future out there.


[02-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	That is a long way from home o_o


[02-Oct-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... population of 4... settlers


[02-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm currently making a spreadsheet of planets in the region within 6 jumps of Saladin to see what the best places are for all the core resources.


[02-Oct-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I got a spreadsheet I can share if you like... literally went through every single resource in PrUn, lol


[02-Oct-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	@Rubi, Montem's not enough? ;-)


[02-Oct-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'll DM you... so far probably three SNF guys are going


[02-Oct-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**skaterror**:	people, how and when will the problem of the pioneers be solved ? i need pioneers :(


[03-Oct-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Uh two weeks at this point


[03-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	oh damn, so it makes no sense to build something that requires pioneers today because it's just not gonna work ? (thinking that im already at -30 pioneers for my current buildings)


[03-Oct-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well... it's complicated. Building stuff that doesn't get employees does help drive pioneer demand


[03-Oct-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Which is important


[03-Oct-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Population reports usually update Wednesdays, so best bang for buck is to put up the buildings sometime on Tuesday whenever there's a shortage


[03-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	oh good to know, so then *some* pioneers arrive on wednesday, or just the system realized that there is a high demand and "pressures" it  ?


[03-Oct-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	if you have like under 900 pioneers total, you will likely get all your's filled this next PoPR (Not completely sure where the cutoff is right now)


[03-Oct-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Building new pioneer buildings right before the pop report is a good idea.


[03-Oct-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	There's no reserve of pioneers at the moment, but you'll almost certainly get pioneers redistributed to you when the pop report hits.


[03-Oct-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	perfect, so i'll build it before wednesday


[03-Oct-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	so if I build it lets say on thursday that means i will have to wait until next wednesday to have my demand of pioneers fullfilled because of the lack of pioneers that we have right now

***skaterror** deleted this message.*


[03-Oct-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Yes. On Wednesday is the redistribution. Anytime before that, you get 1.


[03-Oct-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	nice


[03-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Though mind the time zones.


[03-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You should check the planet's population page to see when the next pop report will be.


[03-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It's always 7 days after the last one.


[03-Oct-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Right now that daily tick happens in ~6 hours.


[03-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If you open up the pop report you can see how long ago the previous one was


[03-Oct-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	it says 4 days and 19 hours so still some days


[03-Oct-21 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Small heads up.  My pro has run out and I can no longer post ads selling SF or KOM.


[03-Oct-21 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**skaterror**:	but i have no idea which way to go haha


[04-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Or, you can build BMPs and produce PE


[04-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	pols ?


[04-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	PE is so not worth to make that I always buy it even though I could produce it myself


[04-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	POLymer Plants


[04-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	i mean PE its cheap to produce tho, if i make my own carbon bc it makes 200 each 7 hours or so


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	you'd be better off selling that carbon


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	now that PE is back above 5 it feels less bad to make


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	^


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but yes sell the carbon for sure


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If Carbon is at a low value or isn't selling, convert to PE / PG


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah selling the carbon seems the wisest now


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	even with PE above 5 there


[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Honestly, a BMP isn't a bad choice though because you can make your own OVE/PWO


[04-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	my first base on Vallis was a PE-focused base, then i pivoted to smelting


[04-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	i would have to buy everything to do that


[04-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	if you're so determined to use that carbon, then POL


[04-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	maybe its a good idea to go to POL


[04-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	im juist afraid of carbon crashing haha


[04-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	or smelt


[04-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	metals will always be in high demand around here


[04-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it will eventually, but right now theres a carbon shortage


[04-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	everyone smelts on Vallis and Montem, so C is always in demand


[04-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	is it smart if my third infrastructure building is a HBB instead of a third HB1 even if i dont need settlers or should i just go for a HB1


[04-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	that's very true


[04-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you want to build habs that you will use the employees for, and HBB's have more expensive parts to build them


[04-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	^


[04-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	mixed wf habs are too expensive, they are only worth it if your base is almost full and couldn't fit a regular hab


[04-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Honestly though, the HBB for PIO/SET is the best one


[04-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah i think ill build an hb1 and expand my carbon business and drown with the ship if it does


[04-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	oh i didnt know there was a moment when you can not fit habs


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	buying GRN at the station and burning it to make C is not a bad plan, I did that on vallis for a long time


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	As someone who started in Carbon


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	INC's just have really long cycle times unless you mix feed


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have three pieces of advice for you


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	One: don't be afraid of getting into the HYF


[04-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	On Montem, this isn't such good advice because there's no local water


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	what's HYF ? sorry


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Hydroponics Farm


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	oh oh


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	BUI HYF


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	BUI HYF


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Advice Two: You don't have to produce the burnables on the same planet as the INC and you maybe shouldn't do that anyway.


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	building 2 HYF's now...with a plan to get water!


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	At the start of the universe, we didn't have a good source of HE3 to make FF


[04-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so the shipping logistics made it somewhat unprofitable to sprawl out


[04-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but you do not have to contend with this problem


[04-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Advice 3: Having market orders for GRN / HCP / MAI @ about 5-10% below your break-even input price is smart because (depending on who sells you what) you can run the 3 ingredient burn more often by tuning your FRMs / HYFs to account for what you didn't get sold


[04-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Bonus Advice: _always try and run the 3 ingredient burn if Carbon is above 300_


[04-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah i need a way to get MAI, seems very profitable


[04-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	things to remember...planning to run the GRN-HCP burn for a while


[04-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	2 ingredient = never


[04-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	really?


[04-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	When you're starting out, GRN + HCP is good


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but you really do want to lock up that 3 ingredient burn


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	ASAP


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	GRN or 3


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well if I could get a MAI supplier *cough cough* then that might be a plan


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah i want to do that but i cant find a way to have enough grn and hcp to produce withotu running out every second


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I got a shitload of MAI but it's a PITA to haul


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	where are you hauling it in from?


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	verdant


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Either Verdant or another OT planet


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=)


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_it's like I know the business too well_


[04-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	so i shouldnt run grn hcp = c ?


[04-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	In the absence of MAI, it's the best choice


[04-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah


[04-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	but if i use mai (bc i could buy it ), my farms can't keep up with the demand of grn hcp


[04-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Correct.


[04-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	damn hahaha


[04-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	For reference, I run a 3:2 FRM to INC ratio with 3 AG experts and 2 RE experts


[04-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it makes the time ratios just about perfect


[04-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I tend to buy GRN and grow MAI + HCP


[04-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	im gonna buy my third farm now in some hours


[04-Oct-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	hm, well skaterror, if you want to grow MAI, I'd be a steady buyer lol


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	and i'd also be having 3:2 ratio of frm and inc


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	mai is better to grow here than grn because it needs less water


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The big problem with MAI is that HYF grown MAI is almost always at a loss


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but it's faster


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	oh, dunno about hyf


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so you absorb the "loss" into making the Carbon which is fine


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im only growing HCP on my HYF's


[04-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because it is more area and time efficient


[04-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The problem is always H2O


[04-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	but h2o is right now cheap so i just buy it


[04-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	currently ahve like 200 lol


[04-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you build a HYF, you will need about 3-4X that


[04-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah


[04-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I might have a solution to that, as I'm gonna be trucking that all in


[04-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	that's the best expansion way buuuuuut it takes some saving


[04-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you decide to go the POL route instead of just specializing in C


[04-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I provide MG on the planet (at least for the near to mid term)


[04-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	i think im gonna just specialize in C tm


[04-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	atm


[04-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I would buy 18 MAI/day...if thats something of interest


[04-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and depending on water needs, might be able to supply that too


[04-Oct-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Last call MONT>HRT


[04-Oct-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	hey i just realized i have 1000 in AIC CIS and ICA I'm planning on making a very all in move. how can i exchange those to NCC ? is that even possible ?


[04-Oct-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Not without you traveling to another CX, or getting a PRO license


[04-Oct-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	but then it's only 1k each which is basically nothing :p


[04-Oct-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	depending on where/when you might not even get a full bfab from it


[04-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	and if you want to expand later, you'll find it very useful for e.g. buying that first warehouse on a different CX


[04-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	3k was a lot when I was < 2 months old


[04-Oct-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	good to know!


[04-Oct-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	but you waste more than 1k even flying to the other CX ;)


[04-Oct-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	is it not better to put it to use if you can, rather than letting it sit doing nothing?


[04-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	sure. just adding to fuyutsuki's statement - if you don't have PRO and don't fly to another CX regardless, you might as well just ignore that money


[04-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	oh yeah for those conditions, for sure


[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	when I first got pro I liquidated it on the fx market :D


[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	back when 3k was... semi-a lot of money


[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm not going to say it's a rounding error now


[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it's becoming more and more so


[04-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	i would get pro but i just dont really like paying monthly, if it would be once i would do it right away i dont know why but it's just not my thing


[04-Oct-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	it's easier with 2 accounts anyway


[04-Oct-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wat


[04-Oct-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	multi accounting is not allowed, you could be banned for that


[04-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	you seem to be doing it


[04-Oct-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**skaterror**:	yeah i was using a second account because i wanted to understand how the manufacturer works but then someone told me that it was not allowed and i coliq that second account


[04-Oct-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	oh. okay


[04-Oct-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	When I did math on making C, I always ended up with the HCP + MAI recipe fed by HYFs


[04-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but that's for growing own burnables and burning them locally


[04-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And locally usually meant on a planet with H2O


[04-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	did you take depreciation into account at all?


[04-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	that sounds very odd


[04-Oct-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No, just max C production


[04-Oct-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FRMs are so big


[04-Oct-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	oh, so that math was not for profit math


[04-Oct-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It was for full base production math


[04-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Sadly, I didn't save that version


[04-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The only one I saved was the BDE farm version that makes everything but the H and NS locally


[04-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well and some of the water, but runs on OT-442b


[04-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	On Montem, you'd just import all the water I guess


[04-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but that all-BDE base would have made 28.31 BDE per day


[04-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and 24 C per day


[04-Oct-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think the pure C farm versions made 100+ C


[04-Oct-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The problem with GRN is that it can't be grown in a HYF


[04-Oct-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The BDE farm would be stupidly profitable right now BDE.NC1


[04-Oct-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	of course I went in a different direction


[04-Oct-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lots of options, lots of possibility!

[05-Oct-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I was hoping to make a combination of OVE and PWO since I have the PG


[05-Oct-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	for personal use only, I don't sell these items


[05-Oct-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so it looks like 12 COT


[05-Oct-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if my math is right


[05-Oct-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	6 for OVE and 6 for PWO


[05-Oct-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'd also take SIO, if anyone has it on-world


[05-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	sorry, I don't have that quantity to spare. Most of my COT goes into OVE/PWO for me.


[05-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's understandable.


[05-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I wonder if anyone would be willing to ship SIO in


[05-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah, 200/u right now is the only ask on MOR


[05-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I can see that, it's just surprising. it's been sold under production cost for months


[05-Oct-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah it was low for awhile


[05-Oct-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I stopped really making it because it wasn't worth it, other than what was needed for my workers


[05-Oct-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	ya I didn't even make it for my own consumption because it was just so much better to use the BMP time for actually profitable things

**DaddyDustin**:	still got roughly 3-4 hours before I head off.


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have some "puddle jump" shipments


[05-Oct-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh, you're going from CX to planet. Nevermind


[05-Oct-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@WarfareBot easy solution is to use less than 1,000 PIOs =)


[05-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	oh yes, please everybody demo your buildings, then the PIO shortage is over ^^


[05-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Yeah, I am unfortunately not going to be going back to the CX for a few days. Got two big shipments that I gotta go grab after getting to Montem


[05-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	For my plans, I am going to produce another HB1, 2 POLs, and a PP1


[05-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I wanted to add 2 EXT two weeks ago, not even trying now :/


[05-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Wouldn't be worth it even _not_ facing the PIO shortage.


[05-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	LST.NC1 is nearly worth dogwater


[05-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Order book is kinda thin past 35


[05-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	yes, but I don't get enough for that price on LM + I don't have the shipping


[05-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	and don't want to constantly scan LM ;)


[05-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yeah, I feel that.


[05-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I more or less try and run my company on the concept of using the LM as "futures"


[05-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can buy my production at a fixed cost which is somewhere in the spread "right now"


[05-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If the price goes up, you got a good deal. If the price goes down, oh well, you got what you needed.


[05-Oct-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It lets me run Montem without needing to ship things in and out all the time which is useful because YI-280j is a fair hop away, and my next base is going to be on LS-231b. I'll be in a big triangle


[05-Oct-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	oh I just looked at PE.NC1 loool


[05-Oct-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

I just hope we get enough PIO income to permit me to actually do that. There are ~2400 open jobs and nobody to fill 'em until the next report comes in.

[07-Oct-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It is in my plans to construct an AML (if not two AMLs) and Tech / Eng availability is important for that. Assuming that the AMLs are profitable, I would be more than willing to pay a "ghost tax" by providing upkeep to those structures


[07-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@PoroSef & @Cygal : Your shipments will arrive at MOR tomorrow. Please render payment or have your shit stolen.


[07-Oct-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm getting it there in 1/3rd and 1/5th of the contract times


[07-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	there is when I don't have WAR space to hold these shipments


[07-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and this ship needs to depart on a tight turnaround


[07-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	that is your mis-planning not theirs


[07-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Probably right.


[07-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I don't think it was blunt though


[07-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	@Hollo "Pay noe or I am taking your shit" is blunt, esp when the terms are clear from the start


[07-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm mostly honey

**AngryK1tten**:	The problem with PIOs last week was that people ramped up employment even faster than the migration. Sooner or later, people will run out of space for expansion.

[09-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	but our demand for new pioneers is clearly growing very fast too


[20-Oct-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	it's still true :) all open pio jobs were filled last cycle and now as well (now we had 2162 open jobs and gained almost 11k)


[20-Oct-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	pio*


[20-Oct-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yes, demand is growing. maybe people realized they can have more and started to demand more


[20-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah but, even if the open job "bug" is there, it doesn't mean that we don't need more pioneers. There is a lot of loss of productivity if we are gonna be short on pioneers for 3 more months at this race


[20-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	*rate


[20-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	we're not gonna be short on pios, we have plenty now


[20-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	well you won't have open jobs if there is still enough PIO left from previous POPR


[20-Oct-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	This is officially the fastest flight to MOR I've ever had:


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	36 minutes


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	if there are open jobs it means that people used all up (and some)


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Hollo, that's what people told me last cycle!


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	not entirely true aeryen, because they couldn't pull all from the reserve


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I mean, people who wanted more pios wanted more than they were allocated from reserve


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if I understand the "open job" thing correctly, it's effectively "behind" one week rigth?


[20-Oct-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	and they got them at popr


[20-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yes


[20-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	last week we had 2684 open jobs, this week we had 2162 open jobs. We are still gonna have a lot of open jobs next week too


[20-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	well, not one week...


[20-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I'm not sure if those show up as open jobs because if there were reserve left at the end of POPR but some people still have needs, we couldn't calculate the next reserve easily


[20-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	we're gonna have open jobs if people keep demanding them at this rate


[20-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah..


[20-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	reserve is an exact number that can be calculated


[20-Oct-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	now I can pull 882 pios from the pool. now if I build new buildings that need 1k, I will contribute to the "open jobs" number with 118


[20-Oct-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	last week the individual reserve was around 200


[20-Oct-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	easy to exceed


[20-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	but also reserve matched migration - open jobs afaik


[20-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I will be going up to 900 PIOs next week


[20-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	everyone who built stuff needing 200+ pios last week contributed to open jobs


[20-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and then I will likely stop building PIO buildings


[20-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yes, that's why we have 4x the reserve now than last week


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Montem has 42 free plots and people are expanding their base area


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Here is my review:


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	say there is 1k PIO in reserve (so 100 per player), then 5 players pull 200 each -> still 500 left in reserve and each has 100 open jobs. at POPR what would the open job number be?


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	those plots will be filled soon too


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Pioneers grew 11k, yet open jobs went down by only about 500, at this pace we'll be several months before the problem is eliminated. We need faster pioneer growth.


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Settlers unemployment has gone 12% - 9.4% - 5.1% - 2.8%. In about two cycles we will be officially short on them, and the demand is clearly growing a lot faster than the Settler popi.


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Technicians are growing, and open jobs went from 515 -> 457, which is good. But it's very likely more people want to use technicians but wont' because of the shortage. I suspect we actually need a lot more.


[20-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	We actually got some engineers and somebody is using them. That's cool!

[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	There is an AML on Montem


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	at least one.


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	1k reserve is 100 per player because reserve setting is 10% on most(every?) planets


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So I'm guessing that the AML is using the ENGs


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	My conclusion is that while this level of popi building is keeping us from losing popi, it's not growing popi at the same pace as our growing demand.


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yeah nvm I was thinking about something else


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	we have 8,8k unemployed pioneers now


[20-Oct-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	or maybe wrong wording, 1k PIOs available meaning each player can get 100


[20-Oct-21 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	So, I'm thinking we want to build more. Opinions?


[20-Oct-21 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

***Hollo** deleted this message.*


[20-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Pioneers form the backbone of the population growth efforts because of the way that the math works out for growing higher pops. If you want more ENG, you need more tech, so you need more SET, so you need more PIOs.


[20-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	@rubicate probably yes, though I heard that after lvl 5 it may be more efficient to look for getting lvl 1 of other popi buildings providing same type. but surely need to check again


[20-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	makes sense


[20-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The fact that we have hit PIO growth in a big way is good. As long as PIO Happiness stays over 72%, I would then focus on improving settler numbers


[20-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	rn I would prefer SET to be pushed a bit more than PIO. PIO is still ok


[20-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	my goal would be to make a population funnel


[20-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I keep mixing my things up today so last comment: pio happiness is 78,3% and we only need it to be 70+


[20-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Hollo we'll want it in the mid 70s if we are growing SET/TECH because we need to have migrations via education


[20-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	we don't want to educate the PIOs without replacement


[20-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	8,8k won't be educated lol


[20-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So that's my opinion. I would make the "population funnel" by targeting SET now that PIO happiness is > 71


[20-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	PIO->SET education next POPR will be 1504


[20-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if we can get Settler happiness over 70, then tech happiness is next (it's just barely above 70)


[20-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	TEC happiness is also 70+ so I also say target SET now


[20-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and after that, ENG happiness


[20-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	let's not get ahead of ourselves that much :D


[20-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think going after scientists on Montem is going to take a longer discussion


[20-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	1 building this week to target SET is my vote


[20-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but I do believe that Montem needs tech/eng


[20-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	actually ENG happiness shouldn't be that bad right now - it's will just take a while to get all those 0% from last POPRs out of the system


[20-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	definitely


[20-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	well people are complaining that they don't have enough tech


[20-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	yeah I really would like to swap some buildings to tech buildings as well but not the situation for that rn for me


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	btw this doesn't have to be guesswork. the popi calculator sheet is incredibly accurate now


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	sure, but I don't have it set up rn :p


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	won't pull all the popi with 100% accuracy automatically but if you set it correctly it nails it


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	you don't have to set it up


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	it has a script that pulls all the data


[20-Oct-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	you just adjust the popi and if you think the demand will drastically shift


[20-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	take the sheet, make a copy, change planet to montem? :)


[20-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yep


[20-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I already have chrome crashing my base gsheets :/


[20-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	don't use chrome (::


[20-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	probably would also crash firefox or any other browser... just way to many open tabs :p


[20-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	open a firefox without 200 tabs :D


[20-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	idk I also have an addon that puts inactive tabs to sleep, never goes above 2G


[20-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	did you know that windows can scroll vertically between windows of the same application if grouped if they exceed the monitor height? ^^


[20-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I did not. first thing I change after every windows install is to not use window grouping


[20-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	also I can see like half a letter of the page titles on the tabs


[20-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	also had some windows were the tab isn't even accessible because well too many


[20-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so (silence)


[20-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	and I hate ingame chat and have better things to do (:


[20-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	oh yeah, a little update on our finances:


[20-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Our expenses is currently 321k NCC every 10 day, the breakdown is 120k for CoGC, 55k for SST, 56k for INF, 90k for PAR


[20-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Taxes come in every 7 days, but adjusted for a 10 day cycle we pull in about 480k NCC every 10 days, so we have a neat surplus


[20-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	That surplus has gone towards buying a buffer of popi consumables as supplying them all at the very last moment is unrealistic


[20-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The two strategies forward seems to be to either use this surplus to build more buildings as we can afford them, or to raise taxes even higher to gain a spike in income to get the buildings faster


[20-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Opinions?


[20-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My initial impression is to wait and see how things settle, and slow


[20-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	… slowly work towards the next buildings.


[20-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Only concern is that we might be facing a settler squeeze next, based on trends?


[20-Oct-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyone have PG they can sell on planet?


[20-Oct-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**paradx**:	how much you need?


[20-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	@aeryen If you don't have techs already you wouldn't feel the lack of them as badly. The way pops are distributed favors those using less pops so someone just entering (say 40 techs) will get that filled and those with 200+ might not get any

[21-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	heh same


[21-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	not trying to start one, if 75/u is too low, then put up a reasonable price and I'll take that


[21-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I just brought it here because I couldn't afford the time to bring it to cx ^^


[21-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	not in a rush either, but at some point if I can get a local source ill buy in bulk pretty often


[21-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	place a buy order, and one of us will fulfill. I offered to be helpful, and because I have a bit of excess.


[21-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Since a lot of us are using Hydrogen, how would you guys feeling about buying a piece of Madweny's 500 Hydrogen lots?


[21-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I got a base on a H GG, so .. no


[21-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would run the logistics on it and bring back 500 Hydrogen to split according to planet needs


[21-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	could be tempting, I'm looking at ~160/wk after theyre built up


[21-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	got a meeting to run to, but thats an interesting idea


[21-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So either Aeryen increases imports, or we take turns on the H logistics


[21-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Aeryen now you know that people need your Hydrogen at a decent price


[21-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	well, I'd like, but my 2 ships are running like 99% of their time now


[21-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I understand that. Mine are spread thin all the time too


[21-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I should probably get rid of my promitor base to take the pressure off but then I need a different place for all that stuff there


[21-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	but it would be a shame for all those experts :)

[21-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Hey guys, Hope I can ask a few quick questions in here? Anyways, what is the best idea to get this business of mine off the ground? I chose metallurgy, so im thinking get up to 3 extractors and 2 smelters. Is this (kinda) the right way to go? Additionally, where could I buy the stuff ? From the commodity market ?


[21-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	that's not a bad start. you may not need to go to the market much at first - the local market can get you most of what you need


[21-Oct-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Alright thanks. Is it a smart move to quickly expand to multiple bases or focus on the first one?


[21-Oct-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I guess that's a personal choice? depends on your goals.


[21-Oct-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Usual advice is to max out one base. I didn’t follow that advice.


[21-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah I'd recommend you build up some steam on the first base first


[21-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	In my case, I was over-diversified on Montem, because my inputs were in short supply.


[21-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	doesn't mean you need to build it to 100%


[21-Oct-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	I am now working on adding a third base, so I can sensibly split my production to maximise experts.


[21-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Building a second base is somewhat expensive just for the base itself so it's usually better to fill up the first one


[21-Oct-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That said, if there's some resource you really need and has gotten expensive, the second base might make sense


[21-Oct-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Aha I see. Thanks guys !


[21-Oct-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the components for a second base are cheaper now than they used to be


[21-Oct-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Point to keep in mind - third is more painful than second, since you need to upgrade HQ as well. That should be held off as long as possible.


[21-Oct-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Alright got it


[21-Oct-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So is there any relationship between distance of planets from the "main" starting solar systems and the possible yields?


[21-Oct-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Nope


[21-Oct-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yes. But if you're impatient, try to fill it to at least 50 or 60% so you have some decent cash coming in to support an expansion.


[21-Oct-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	oops - my 'yes' was to an earlier question. (I'm typing too slow haha)


[21-Oct-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So why would someone settle down in the far depths of the universe?


[21-Oct-21 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	challenge. no annoying neighbors. uninterrupted bomb-making. you know... the usual.

[21-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	You only have one plot. You can expand its size, but still one plot.

[22-Oct-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats a full ship of 500, right?


[22-Oct-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Hello there, I saw that free players can not build their own ship. But could I buy another ? or am I limited to one ship?


[22-Oct-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	You can not buy ships. You have to buy the components and assemble at a shipyard. So I suspect that is not possible for you. Very few players have added third ships yet. So you'll be fine with your starting 2 for months.


[22-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	It's a real shame H prices are spiking as soon as I dismantle my GG.  I feel like I could make good money by keeping it up, but I need the extra base permits and I can't risk prices falling again


[22-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Yeah, I think the higher H prices are tied to PE prices after the spike and recovery


[22-Oct-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**aeryen**:	note don't build a rig here ;)


[23-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	I was planning to hahah :)


[23-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Why not if I can ask?


[23-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	the consumables that you use for the rig are very costly because montem's H2O resource is not very good


[23-Oct-21 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	so it's very very usual that buying the H2O that gets shipped in from other planets are far cheaper (maybe except in a crisis)


[23-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	aaah yes I can see now. H20 is only 26 per piece


[23-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	I wanted to start producing Carbon myself since 300 a piece cuts pretty heavy in my costs when smelting iron. That is somewhat reasonable right ?


[23-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So then i'll buy H20 and get a farmstead > incinerator > for carbon


[23-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	well you should compare that to e.g. just building more smelters and buying the inputs


[23-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	of course there is no correct answer, it's always about risk. C price could get higher, so building FRM + INC would isolate you against that, but if C gets lowere, you are missing out on profits


[23-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	If im consuming 0.4 units per day. Does that mean behind the scenes there are fractions going on, or is it rounded ?


[24-Oct-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You always consume a whole number, but it won't consume the next one until after you get through the fraction.


[24-Oct-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So on day one it consumes 1, then none on day two, 1 on day three, none on days four or five, and back to the start.


[24-Oct-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	it's still 5k EPO, that's a pretty good amount, I was about to send mine to the cx if it was empty, but I'll wait.


[24-Oct-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Yeah, it looks like it will take awhile for it to be absorbed. I’ve put up a few slugs of 100 units or less, and it took awhile for buyers to show up.


[24-Oct-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	350k ncc


[24-Oct-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah that'll take a while


[24-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	for people doing R-fabs, 5k isn't all that much, but most people that do R-fabs have suppliers lined up already


[24-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I guess that isn't all that accurate, 5k is still a pretty good amount, but if someone is doing a ton of RSE it really isn't


[24-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow that's only 44 RSE


[24-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	with experts, they go through around 450 EPO/day, so only like 12 days of production


[24-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	with one PP3, most have more then one PP3 tho


[24-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	I didn't know the numbers on REFs were this good


[25-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Selling at ~ 8.5 NCC per SF is just about 1,800 profit per day


[25-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	No wonder TS got rich


[25-Oct-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Is there anything that I could produce to help you guys get a local producer? Currently just started so it will take a while before production is off the ground, but I'd like to help contribute to the montem community since it feels like players on the same planet need to collaborate to advance further in the game if I'm not mistaken ?


[25-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Montem is already pretty interwoven


[25-Oct-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	is Katoa generally a good fuel planet?


[25-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	where a lot of the big players are


[25-Oct-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow yeah 17.5 day ROI selling @8\ea


[25-Oct-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	on Katoa


[25-Oct-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	In all honesty Waffles, you would probably do well to just be an importer and shipper right now while you learn about the economy


[25-Oct-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	^ agree, don't worry about that too much (yet)


[25-Oct-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You could also go _super hard mode_ and travel yourself to Outer Haven and work in a virgin section of the universe


[25-Oct-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	to suggest that to a new player is bad


[25-Oct-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Nah


[25-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's prefaced by "super hard mode"


[25-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	more coliq mode


[25-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I wouldn't call it COLIQ mode


[25-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it's a good way to feel what a "new game" is like (AKA, what is the universe like post-reset)


[25-Oct-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	you do you but in my opinion you need to understand the basics before doing something like outer haven


[25-Oct-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	For sure.


[25-Oct-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well, if you're interested Waffles, you could run a GF


[25-Oct-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Now, on Montem this is probably not a good idea since we don't have a natural source of SIO


[25-Oct-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	GF barely uses any SIO it's not a big concern imo


[25-Oct-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	^


[25-Oct-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	This is what I was going to point out


[25-Oct-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have two and they use 3\day


[25-Oct-21 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have a planet that produces a large-ish amount of SIO per day and I would be willing to either let you pick it up, or have it delivered


[25-Oct-21 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I would give you a very good price to help you start


[25-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Other ideas: You can grow stuff on OT-442b (Danakil) and bring it here for people who run INCs


[25-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can grow stuff here and sell it to people who run INCs / FPs (Montem isn't the best agricultural planet, but it's a thing you can do)


[25-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	montem works ok for agri, but yeah it isn't the best and eventually want to save your buildings there for higher teir pops


[25-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can run FPs and import water / PG + ingredients to make RATs (though this is, again, not optimal)


[25-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can make "easy money" by just running extractors and selling Limestone


[25-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	as LST @ 60 is 900 profit per day on an EXT


[25-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you could do worse.


[25-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But figuring out what you want to do is a good first step. You can pretty much do whatever and make money


[25-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the hard part is making "as much as you can"


[25-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	good lujck


[25-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Thanks for all the help guys! Currently im trying to get some additional extractors running for limestone, which I can sell to support the stuff I have going on to make BSE and BBH for even more buildings


[25-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	I think I'll stay here for a while and learn the game though :)


[25-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So a GF would be a glass furnace correct?


[25-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So my current plan is mining iron / limestone > smelting iron > turning iron & limestone into BSE / BBH for additional extractors / smelters and production plants. And overproduction is sold to pay for the costs and additional expansion. So it would take some time to get the GF running, but I'm def interested :)

**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I sold some for 30 the other day


[26-Oct-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	so who knows how long it will last


[26-Oct-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, given SIO.NC1


[26-Oct-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh, that's going back up again


[26-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	honestly the cost of SIO has a pretty minor effect on my cost of production when prices are this high


[26-Oct-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah but it feels shit to be paying 3x what it was before


[26-Oct-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It was right before I built the TNP


[26-Oct-21 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	And where is a good spot for doing so ? (New player)


[28-Oct-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	hard part is the INS/AEF for the GG base


[28-Oct-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	probably better to go for sio farm


[28-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	agreed


[28-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like XG-430b and put down some extractors


[28-Oct-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	If you're setting up bases over in XG space, you will be in a good spot to also settle a gas giant


[28-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah but gas giants need more upfront investment


[28-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	True, I'm more pointing out that if he's starting over there that he will be in a good position to expand to the H/AR GG


[28-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	ahhhh ok


[28-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah


[28-Oct-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it's easier to manage logistics when your bases are in clusters


[28-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	^


[28-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's why my first 5 bases are clustered around moria lol


[28-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to tide over until we really start getting lots of FTL ships


[28-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and that becomes less of a problem


[28-Oct-21 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I see _one_ contract for planet -> cx.


[02-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	well, two.


[02-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	A bunch of us are colonizing the planet Saladin


[02-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	9 Moria -> Vallis LMs


[02-Nov-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Then the rest of them are ads for large interstellar flights


[02-Nov-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Hortus -> Local. Local -> Hortus. LB-428 -> Local


[02-Nov-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	Verdant has also a huge amount of shipping contracts


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and most of the Moria -> Vallis stuff is mostly full ships


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Yeah, shipping is insane right now it seems


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and honestly, the rates on those aren't super great


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	^


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	GTU is settling Kinza


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would have taken the Moria -> Vallis routes under two conditions:


[02-Nov-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	1) There was a shipment from Vallis -> Moria or Vallis -> CX that made sense to take (there wasn't)


[02-Nov-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	2) The rates were not a pittance. I get that the time and distance on inter-system transit is low right now, but 2 NCC per ton/m3 for a full ship with these fuel prices is garbage


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm seeing a lot of shipping contracts go unfulfilled


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	people are still paying old prices for cheaper fuel


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So I dispatched my "free ship" out to Antares to pick up another 500 Hydrogen because in 6 days transit time, I make more in profit doing that then moving all these garbage shipping orders around


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	I always try and do a decent rate, but perhaps I should bump up my rate. I just need some stuff to go to the CX right now, cause I am about to run out of stuff to make FE xD


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	and I need the money


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I think there is less shipping capacity too, players are getting bigger and bigger


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	needing their own more and more


[02-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Some of you may remember long ago when I said, "These shipping rates are trash. Shipping is undervalued"


[02-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	(by long ago, I do mean 5+ months)


[02-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Shippers unite!


[02-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah I think full ships were 8k minimum last universe most of the time


[02-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and they only carried 400/400


[02-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	my standard rate was 20k :D


[02-Nov-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	but I also don't consume much... yet™


[02-Nov-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that is changing rapidly lol


[02-Nov-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm about 3 days away from popping 2x BMP 2x POL


[02-Nov-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	33/day is starting to get painful in this market


[02-Nov-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm gonna eventually need 40 myself


[02-Nov-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I feel ya


[02-Nov-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	still with there were electrolyzers in the game


[02-Nov-21 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	H2O in to create H and O would be really nice, even if they were like T2


[02-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ubermensch**:	then even more people would flock to the water worlds


[02-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	right, thats why it would need to be gated higher in the tech tree


[02-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	make it as costly as settling a GG


[02-Nov-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	idk, makes more sense if/when they add power requirements to the game


[02-Nov-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or make the electrolyzers expensive themselves


[02-Nov-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	Yeah if you can turn H2O into 2H+O then there's no reason to settle H or O worlds


[02-Nov-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	@Matsuyama are those ads meant for someone specific?


[02-Nov-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I can fill the OVE/PWO but don't want to grab them if they're meant for someone else


[02-Nov-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I only saw Lowstrife's ad


[02-Nov-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@TwilightSentinel did someone else take yours?


[02-Nov-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	And @shadowsneak I'm bringing it in son. If you need the Hydrogen, set up the long-term buy and I will fill it when the Hydrogen comes in. 8+ days please.


[02-Nov-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I still have 400 unsold


[02-Nov-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im at 250/wk, but dont have 8 days supply to wait for right now


[02-Nov-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I understand that. Ships take time. Mine is moving as fast as it's little engine can take it


[02-Nov-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i can probably put an order for 250 in 8 days from now, what unit price are you looking for?


[02-Nov-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I did 82.25 for Lowstrife. I'll take as low as 80, but it's really up to you


[02-Nov-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I gave him the same offer and that's the price he picked


[02-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	ive been trying to get 80/u as well, but since youre flying it in i can accomodate a bit extra


[02-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can do 80 and it won't hurt my feelings


[02-Nov-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I promise.


[02-Nov-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that'd be cool. would probably need to be pay on delivery


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	okay, 8 days you say?


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	at least. The ship is 3 days out to pick up the Hydrogen and at least 3 days back


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It can be for 20 for all I care, when it gets here, it's here and I will provision it


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i can make it 10 for comfort


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats fine too


[02-Nov-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The delivery timeline is more for your comfort in payment


[02-Nov-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	okay, sounds good. should be able to pay on delivery, just also planning a 3rd base in that time window so things get crazy you know?


[02-Nov-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I do.


[02-Nov-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	ad up


[02-Nov-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	cool beans


[02-Nov-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	There you go.


[02-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	This will be the third time I'm making the trip to pick up H for sale


[02-Nov-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the first time I ended up just using it all


[02-Nov-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	then Hydrogen prices jumped and I used half and sold half


[02-Nov-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	this time I'm selling a majority of it because people need it (and I have a little extra)


[02-Nov-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll be off until tomorrow. 150 H still available


[02-Nov-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Someone else took my ad, yes.


[02-Nov-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or close to delivery at least


[02-Nov-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's more than fine


[02-Nov-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm not in any rush for the money and I wouldn't want to bend anyone backwards to let me do them a service

**lowstrife**:	pop report


[02-Nov-21 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the demand for techs continues!


[02-Nov-21 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	oof... this is the worst one yet


[02-Nov-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	13 techs lost, nearly wiping out the gains from two weeks ago between this week and last


[02-Nov-21 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	for a second I thought you were talking about the planet and was like "bruh"


[02-Nov-21 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	then I remembered your tech plight


[02-Nov-21 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	comfort is the real killer eh


[03-Nov-21 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Far, far too many people are trying to run techs on Montem.


[03-Nov-21 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Like two more parks and another infirmary are needed to maybe get some serious growth to counter these new jobs.


[03-Nov-21 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And even then, you might still have to push up the safety.


[03-Nov-21 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, like this is my biggest single week loss


[03-Nov-21 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My previous biggest was like 5


[03-Nov-21 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was losing ground slowly


[03-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and the government is making what, 10% of the cost of what it takes to run those buildings from taxes of those techs?


[03-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ya tax reform is needed in this game


[03-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I doubt it's as high as that


[03-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	On the upside, available pioneers and settlers went way up.


[03-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So that issue's good for now.


[03-Nov-21 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Plenty of PIO's to pay for our wildlife parks you say?


[03-Nov-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	Main problem is that pop distribution algorithm is broken... people that build their new tech building now get all technicians and people that are waiting for them for months are losing them...


[03-Nov-21 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	no reason for me to even help building popi because all technicians go to new tech bases, I lost 10 technicians this week too


[03-Nov-21 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	maybe we should kidnap technicians


[03-Nov-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	and demand will keep raising because its worth building few tech buildings since you can get first 50tech in week or two


[03-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm tempted to try to set up a university on a Warm, High-grav, high-pressure GG


[03-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	except that would be stupidly expensive even for me


[03-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though, I guess that would be the whole point


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Alternatively, I guess I could go to Circe and Proxion and be the new guy stealing techs


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	only way reasonable is to go to new planet with few friends and build it up


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	and set massive taxes


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Kind of did that Vallis


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	stealing new techs that is


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though I have way fewer there


[03-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so it has its limits


[03-Nov-21 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	if they changed distribution algorithm that everyone would get equal amount of technicians most problems would be fixed


[03-Nov-21 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	20 ppl need techs and 200 arrived so everyone gets 10


[03-Nov-21 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	easy and fair


[03-Nov-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	not like this 10 people lose 100 and 40 people gain 300...


[03-Nov-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WarfareBot**:	Satisfaction of your current techs isnt a factor?


[03-Nov-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	it is


[03-Nov-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	planet satisfaciton is


[03-Nov-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	but distribution always prefers people with lower tech number


[03-Nov-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	so there are always new people with one or two buildings that get all new technicians


[03-Nov-21 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	and people like me who have big base and invested lots of money into technicians are losing them


[03-Nov-21 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	I even helped building some POPI but it has no effect for me it only helps newcomers


[03-Nov-21 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WarfareBot**:	I see. I'm only doing pioineers and a few settlers atm.


[03-Nov-21 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WarfareBot**:	Supeised you lose techs, thoght they'd at least stay with you.


[03-Nov-21 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	yeah... I have space for 275 techs and my numbers last months went like this 170 180 186 190 194 198 199 195 192


[03-Nov-21 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	still with loosing techs, they are probably still making more money than a PIO only base?!


[03-Nov-21 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	but it's a problem - I had no fun loosing 300+ PIO when that PIO shortage happened


[03-Nov-21 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I don't know what you guys are complaining about. My 40 techs are always right where they should be


[03-Nov-21 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	because you only have 40 :)


[03-Nov-21 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WarfareBot**:	Don't think I lost any. Ineeded quite a lot for a couple of weeks then they all arrived at once.


[03-Nov-21 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Think I could double them to 80? Probably. That's how you guys loose your techs I think


[03-Nov-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Increases in smaller sized players who get higher priority due to their smaller tech population


[03-Nov-21 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	Yes that is how it is, lower tech population has higher priority


[03-Nov-21 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PoroSef**:	if entire planet build one tech building I would lose 100 to fill them


[03-Nov-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	good thing it is capped at 25% per POPI but still over a longer time :(


[03-Nov-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	per POPR


[03-Nov-21 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well now I feel bad for wanting to build a tech building


[03-Nov-21 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's gonna be a while


[03-Nov-21 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	methinks


[03-Nov-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You thieving tech thief you


[03-Nov-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I stole all the settlers


[03-Nov-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	on danakil


[03-Nov-21 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Techs are probably the PrUn version of crack cocaine


[03-Nov-21 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's why we should kidnap them from other planets


[03-Nov-21 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	When one ELP with 40 Techs almost outperforms your 13 LST EXT's financially


[03-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It kind of leaves you wanting more


[03-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	touche


[03-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well if we need tech kidnapping, we'll need a bus


[03-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm driving the bus


[03-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	does that make me a bad person?


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hahaha yes. But that's what we need


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Going to go raid Proxion's techs


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	sounds good


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	a few other planets have some too


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they're even unemployed!


[03-Nov-21 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	What?!


[03-Nov-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	those lazy techs. If only they would try to work, then they wouldn't be without work


[03-Nov-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Send out the Colony sh.... Oh yeah they're all sent already


[03-Nov-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Seriously, who doesn't employ techs?


[03-Nov-21 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And why don't the techs just pull themselves up by their bootstraps?


[03-Nov-21 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	Prism has 43 unemployed techs


[03-Nov-21 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That's exactly 1 ELP


[03-Nov-21 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	15k a day or something like that


[03-Nov-21 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But really the limiting factor is supply chain and inventory


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	deimos has 100 unemployed


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	give or take


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That stuff is not only expensive, but requires extensive chains to maintain


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	See 100 you could do something with


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and they have no popi!


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and there isn't a lot of it


[03-Nov-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	like CU and LI


[03-Nov-21 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup


[03-Nov-21 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	We should rename Outer Heaven ADR factory, cause all that stuff is up there


[03-Nov-21 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	If we get the CX there's gonna be a gold rush, lol


[03-Nov-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	too bad everybody can just come in and take all the POPI away ;)


[03-Nov-21 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	and techs will take their own long time anyways...


[03-Nov-21 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I feel like you only fly there if you really want to. It's a 2.5 day journey


[03-Nov-21 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But whatever, populations grow over time


[03-Nov-21 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	can't have all the instant gratifcation


[03-Nov-21 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	need the grind


[03-Nov-21 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Haha you're telling me


[03-Nov-21 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I have 276 PIO's on Saladin. Next POPR I might get 30 ^^


[03-Nov-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	maybe


[03-Nov-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I got 3 settlers on 228b


[03-Nov-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol yup


[03-Nov-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	12/4=3


[03-Nov-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It'll be 30 SET next POPR


[03-Nov-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	So 7 or 8


[03-Nov-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Then 50, 80, 110 etc


[03-Nov-21 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well I can tell you that we won't stop building settler requiring buildings


[03-Nov-21 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	just keep pushing those settlers


[03-Nov-21 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well, at the momemt that won't increase growth


[03-Nov-21 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	More players settling would


[03-Nov-21 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But you've got enough open jobs to drive SET happiness for quite some time


[03-Nov-21 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, and that's not going to stop because we are also going to build CHPs


[03-Nov-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, at least I gained techs on Vallis


[03-Nov-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	not all is lost!


[03-Nov-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but some was


[03-Nov-21 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Vallis also gained 317 techs this week


[03-Nov-21 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and also has 153 engi openings...


[03-Nov-21 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's some real optimism right there


[03-Nov-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Proxion has 20 SCI job openings ^^

[03-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ships are quite a bottleneck


[03-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	10 BDEs up for grabs @ 975 each on the LM


[04-Nov-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ok, moving the HOPs nd ALE to the CX


[04-Nov-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and possibly a WEL


[04-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because once the AML is active and producing BER -> BE, I will have AL + SI, and the SME can turn AL + SI into CF


[04-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and BE + CF = THP


[04-Nov-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fun times


[04-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have a ship coming from Benten to Montem tomorrow-ish


[04-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can run around a little bit and help you with logistics


[04-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if anyone is running montem --> danakil I have 5 tons I'd like to send there


[04-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	departing in the next 48hr is fine


[04-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	10 tons*


[04-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	nah I don't need help - otherwise I'd be more active on the shipping mkt


[04-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's just a lot of shipping contracts are floating around right now keeping my ships very busy


[04-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	& I've got to bring like 20 things to my base so using contracts isn't worth it


[04-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well, the offer still stands if you want to take it


[04-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	thanks anyway


[04-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can eliminate some of your legs of Montem -> CX or CX -> Montem


[04-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I will be able to pay for the purchase in 2 days btw, my ship arrives from benten in 40hr


[04-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My plan is BEN -> Montem -> CX -> Yi-280j


[04-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	with... a lot of money


[04-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hmm. do you have space montem --> cx?


[04-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll have plenty of space


[04-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	one minute please


[04-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Ship docks at Benten in 5 hours. I'm going to finagle the cargo and send it off to Moria CX to sell a lot of LST


[04-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I mean SIO


[04-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	my list of items is 16 long


[04-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	man I wish we had containers :\


[04-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but 16 items * 50 listing fee + tip is just nuts


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'll be okay


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	thanks


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that's only 900 in listing fees


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I didn't say anything about paying me for the shipping


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You're a customer. This is service.


[04-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	This makes it customer service.


[04-Nov-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	could you run montem --> danakil --> cx?


[04-Nov-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	+1000ncc in fuel costs and + about 8 hours


[04-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yeah


[04-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll do that for you


[04-Nov-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok let me run some maths here


[04-Nov-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll be in a meeting for the next hour. Shoot me COM and I'll look at it when it's done


[04-Nov-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm doing the maths and it's actually looking like it will be approx 350 tons\m3


[04-Nov-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll have space


[04-Nov-21 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Paying 7k for a Prism to Montem run. 2 ads are up. That's a pretty good shipping rate if anyone can spare a ship.


[04-Nov-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	those are good prices :(


[04-Nov-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would have taken them if I had the available capacity


[04-Nov-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hope someone can take care of you


[04-Nov-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	same, too busy with new base deployment right now


[04-Nov-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I will try to help with Logistics when my ship arrives back in the region. I can only do so much


[04-Nov-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh and I have to go to HRT to buy consumables


[04-Nov-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ooph


[04-Nov-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's another 3 days for each ship


[04-Nov-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My plan is to run consumables to my bases along with an expansion and PPS @ Yi-280j so that they can sustain for 30 days without additional delivery


[04-Nov-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and then use that time to help ferry people around while my extraction colonies build up goods to ship


[04-Nov-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	somewhat difficult to manage soon as YI-280j is on a 2 day export schedule and it's a 1 day trip out there


[04-Nov-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	FTL ships be our savior


[04-Nov-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	much scale, very increase


[04-Nov-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_I'm working on it_


[04-Nov-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The last mineral required is ZIR, which I will get once I scale out YI-280j and finish the WAR + buildings on LS-231b


[04-Nov-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Proxion + Circe are already working on SCIs for SLs


[04-Nov-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think we'll be at FTL shipbuilding in ~ 3 months


[04-Nov-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh wow circe really is


[04-Nov-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I know for a fact that Lockreed (Rayleonard Corp) is processing BTS -> W


[04-Nov-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because I'm selling him the BTS.


[04-Nov-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the lead time on W is... not great


[04-Nov-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the first ships will be built rapidly because I don't see a world where they don't pre-load the rest of the ship waiting on the WAI


[04-Nov-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	considering how much of it you need


[04-Nov-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's gonna be like RL... cars sitting around without the computer chips, lol


[04-Nov-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ironic that lol


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Did you make any progress on MGS evaluation Xeno?


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I only ask because it's relevant to my plans in the next week


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Alas no, I'm currently away from all my spreadsheets of doom


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Ah, the army of darkness


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=)


[04-Nov-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's my intent to get out to YI-280j and make a LM with my next provision run


[04-Nov-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Since you want to do the thing you told me about, I do need to know some logistics


[04-Nov-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Pretty much. I intend to find whatever is reasonable from ROI perspective, etc. You could throw a starting number at me if you like


[04-Nov-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	ROI for you, or ROI for me?


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Because I have it earmarked at 80 in my planning spreadsheets


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	80 ROI. wow


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	No, 80 for MGS


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh lol


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it makes it a 17.6 day ROI


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah that didn't sound right


[04-Nov-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but that's because I goofed and didn't count INS in the CapEx


[04-Nov-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	sooooo... it's probably more like 24


[04-Nov-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup, something in the 20 day range... that's how our internal prices get worked out anyways, so i have a good basis to go by once I get it open.


[04-Nov-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Before you invest too much, i just wanted to give you a fair warning... we do have an untapped MGS source. I just want to get the industry around it going. Importing PG is easy enough, but I'd like to get us independantly producing some of this stuff.


[04-Nov-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Does your MGS source put out more than 48 per day per ext?


[04-Nov-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well there's two


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	One does, yes


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	The other is... 32 or so


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	All without experts I should add


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh nice, well I'm glad to act as a stopgap in the mean time


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The LM + WAR is still important for BER pickups


[04-Nov-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	doubly so as more players are starting to want BE for CBx MM farms


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Ah okay, right makes sense, the BER is your primary industrial interest


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep.


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	MGS was there as a hold-over until BER demand started to exist.


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and that plan was forged before CBx MMs were a thing


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the entire idea being that BE was needed for TSH


[04-Nov-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and we need TSH for BTS which we need for W which we need for FTL ships


[04-Nov-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Butts in seats aka base permits are the constrained resource for us. If I can hold off on a resource tap that helps


[04-Nov-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you get the idea


[04-Nov-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	same reason why I'm after ZIR. You need ZR for FTL fuel tanks


[04-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But yeah, I have more space on YI-280j to utilize


[04-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	a _lot more_


[04-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Makes sense. Unfortunately we don't really have the TIO to be much of a shipbuilding region. Electronics and cheap access to tech supporting materials are gonna be our primary regional strength


[04-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's why I'm everywhere =)


[04-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm not trying to build a ship. Just fill in the holes.


[04-Nov-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You're planning ahead, it shows


[04-Nov-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm trying to play 6d chess with a 3d brain


[04-Nov-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so I have to work twice as hard in my mind


[04-Nov-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-21 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	we have a CX trade searcher


[04-Nov-21 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-21 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	a burn rate calculator

**Fuyutsuki**:	consumable index calculator


[04-Nov-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and that last one, I am writing an extension to calculate the consumable index for different populations and display them in tandem as separate graphs with datapoints you can mouse over for exact values.

**FilthyPeasant**:	>.> this is a blackhole for time, dear lord why did i find this gem


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	just the workforce stuff atm


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because you are like me


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and lowstrife


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	one of us.


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	one of US.


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	once you start doing math on 40 different items and inputs and outputs it gets messsy so I leave that to PRUNNER


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and honestly, this is a nice little thing to do to keep your mind engaged


[04-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and it doesn't really take _that much time_


[04-Nov-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	seeing as i'm only a few hours in and am already tring to find my best ROI moves to get snowballing, i keep smackign my head into the time scale


[04-Nov-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a very slow burn... at first


[04-Nov-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	not used to demi-realtime in 'games' like these


[04-Nov-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it scales exponentially


[04-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	least i know i get to argue with myself in a few hours for what should be my next constuctions


[04-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's 20 minutes acutally playing


[04-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and 23 hours of planning


[04-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so that when the timer hits, you can execute a pre-planned set of moves instantly


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and even when you screw up you have people like me who will fix your logistics


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because that's what good customer service people do


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or drug dealers


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	however you want to look at it


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	drug dealers


[04-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I needed a fix because I was dealing drugs


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	which is why i started food, less reliance on the drug dealers


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if we count SF arbitrage being drugs, that is


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and shipping contracts


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so many shipping contracts


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I really need to start a better logging system so I know my lead times for when I need to get stuff done


[04-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	otherwise I won't have to bribe... I mean beg... I mean ask someone to fix the problem


[04-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@lowstrife look at Apartment Complex Unit Management Matrices


[04-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	They are generally good for keeping track of multiple moving parts in an efficient format


[04-Nov-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I prefer my 200x200 excel spreadsheet


[04-Nov-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	which exists


[04-Nov-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	in my mind

**Fuyutsuki**:	That's just called unrealized tech debt Sir.

[04-Nov-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	CTF is needed for FIR + LFE


[04-Nov-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've thought about regularizing my KV production


[04-Nov-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	LFE is only the one we care about for larger ships

**TwilightSentinel**:	It's essentially 7 WAI for an FTL ship, assuming you don't want a glass STL engine.


[04-Nov-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	That's a *lot* of scientist production time.


[04-Nov-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	How do most of you get the construction prefabs for higher tier buildings? Since I noticed that demand for these on CX tends to be fairly low, I'd imagine most people make them themselves?


[05-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	only a couple of people in the game can make them


[05-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it's a very... opaque market


[05-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lots are traded in the local market r ather than the cx


[05-Nov-21 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just make mine


[05-Nov-21 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Occasionally I sell them on the CX, but really only if I was planning something then change my mind


[05-Nov-21 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rocketmanne**:	i kinda get the impression that that's the case for a lot of the somewhat more advanced materials


[05-Nov-21 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I would agree with you there, I think the higher tier materials for awhile are going to be made by individuals for personal use or for in-corp use or for people they work closely with.


[05-Nov-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rocketmanne**:	like I'm pretty new and my plan is to just provide LST and FE in bulk bc the local market for them always seems to be great


[05-Nov-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	probably never going to be a bad plan around here


[05-Nov-21 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rocketmanne**:	im assuming bigger companys that started on montem wanted their base space for more advanced building and demolished most of their pioneer buildings?


[05-Nov-21 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	probably, yeah. Move some of the more basic stuff off planet or stop doing it and move into higher tiers

[05-Nov-21 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	np, would've just been convenient ;)


[05-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well, how much do you need


[05-Nov-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I should ask that


[05-Nov-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because I have _some_ overflow capacity


[05-Nov-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I would just take what ever you have left probably, I'll need to go ship visit my other base anyways, so could bring that along

**WarfareBot**:	Started getting bought out before it even the CX Fuyutsuki?


[05-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I sell below the illiquid price of 50


[05-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and it saves people shipping trips


[05-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	(which is becoming important)


[05-Nov-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Aeryen I can give you 200


[05-Nov-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	in my case it's mostly about the lost time


[05-Nov-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	that would keep my POLs up for a while :) not in the jacu business ^^


[05-Nov-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	that would be expensive PG indeed


[05-Nov-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	as I need all of those things


[05-Nov-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I'm not in the business of selling FE - on the contrary


[05-Nov-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's understandable


[05-Nov-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Yeah, on Montem you need to dedicate 1/3 of your entire workforce to water production, and that's if you're running only the slow most water efficient recipes.


[05-Nov-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You'll have nothing available to export afterwards.


[05-Nov-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	while having enough cash for fees to bootstrap


[05-Nov-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	gonna be quite a while before i can do more expansion stuffs, buildings are expensive AF


[05-Nov-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	They're actually very cheap in Moria.


[05-Nov-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Much more than anywhere else.


[05-Nov-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And RAT has a good rate of return at the moment.


[05-Nov-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	that seems almost unreal given my net gains are gonna be 1.2K starting, and the set of 3 structures ran me 35k


[05-Nov-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	litteral month before i can tack on another FP and FRM


[05-Nov-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	ROI rates are usually between 20 and 30 days.


[05-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You can earn some extra cash by doing large shipping orders at the CX with your second ship.


[05-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You can also sell most of your starting fuel for some more cash.


[05-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	If you aren't going off shipping, you obviously don't need any FF saved.


[05-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And there's rarely any reason to keep more than a round trip in your SF fuel tanks.


[05-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(You will need pro to do shipping.)


[05-Nov-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	fair enough, second ship is idle otherwise


[05-Nov-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	since i have no need for speed


[05-Nov-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(Pro requires spending real world money on the game)


[05-Nov-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(Better to play for a couple weeks first and see if you'll even want to keep playing something so slow paced and based on planning as PU.)


[05-Nov-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Buildings used to be at least twice as expensive


[05-Nov-21 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but growth tends to be exponential


[05-Nov-21 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	at least until you run out of base space and cheap base permits


[05-Nov-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	PU definitely fits the definition of 'game as hobby' with its time scale


[05-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In my early days I often tore down buildings aggressively to chase trends


[05-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm not sure it made more money, but it let me feel like I was doing something


[05-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I staunchly grew and made Carbon


[05-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and nothing but


[05-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	then, for no reason other than that I am insane, I built a HAB2 and a FS


[05-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	with no SMEs


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or EXTs


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just started making random shit


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This was my third company


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I started with 3 EXTs and a CHP


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	employing settlers day one


[05-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well, not day one of the game though


[05-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that would have been impossible


[05-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I got to sell LST for 200 once or twice


[05-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and FLX for more than that for a couple weeks?


[05-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but of course BSEs cost twice as much then


[05-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so the ROI was probably not better


[05-Nov-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I built my first EXT when LST crashed the first time


[05-Nov-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I stoically continued to produce LST and sell it locally on montem at slightly above MM prices


[05-Nov-21 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	then I built a second one, because I knew what was coming


[05-Nov-21 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and then LST was magically 160 a month later


[05-Nov-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	LST roi looks tempting rightt now


[05-Nov-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's pretty good


[05-Nov-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	EXTs right now on Montem are 1.2K a day in profit at 100% efficiency


[05-Nov-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you could do worse (literally a PP1 makes less making BSEs)


[05-Nov-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This is new and different actually


[05-Nov-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	for most of the game's history the PP1s have been insane profits


[05-Nov-21 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	LST ain't bad... got *checks* 13 EXT's going brrrrr atm


[05-Nov-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There are some things that make you more money, but LST is easy peasy.. folks always need it. Only downside it's so darn heavy. STO is highly recommended


[05-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	13!


[05-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow


[05-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have 7 EXTs


[05-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	2 here, 2 on LS-231, and 3 on YI-280j


[05-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's more than a full ship per day


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'd build more but I built an ELP on a whim...


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	now I know who is filling those BUYs for 100-200 LST every day


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I used to, but now it's corp only. Can barely keep up


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	sounds like the corp is building fabs


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or flx


[05-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or ns


[05-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and a lot of em


[05-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Once I get around to it I'll probably expand my permit here


[05-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yes yes and yes


[05-Nov-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There's barely anything we don't make. It's kind of annoying actually. Before Outer Heaven I was looking for some new material to make. Every plan I made: "but so and so already makes it"


[05-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	is ragnarock the corp market maker or something?


[05-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because he's got an incredible amount of wealth tied up in the markets


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	SmartDog is our glorious leader ^^


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	<-- me solo


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but growing rapidly...


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	He runs this investment fund that you can basically buy shares in


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ahh ok that makes sense


[05-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and explains everything he does


[05-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hence: market maker


[05-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's wild, my jaw dropped and hit the keyboard when I realized what it was


[05-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But no, that trading has nothing to do with our internal market


[05-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hmm


[05-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I mean occasionally he'll bring something down from the CX if it's needed


[05-Nov-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I mean he has 4 million in orders sitting on the cx


[05-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so that's hardly "occasionally" lol


[05-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but like you say, unrelated


[05-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Which is funny, he's not our largest player base wise. I think it's all CX trading wealth


[05-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	given the kind of trading he does, I agree


[05-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I see exactly what he's doing and will be doing it myself before long tbh


[05-Nov-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Some market phases appear to be better than others.


[05-Nov-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's all a bit beyond me tbh


[05-Nov-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@lowstrife your goods are now in transit


[05-Nov-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you're welcome


[05-Nov-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	delivery tomorrow sometime. Depends on when I get home


[05-Nov-21 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok ty ty


[06-Nov-21 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	test


[06-Nov-21 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	test failed


[06-Nov-21 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	test success!


[06-Nov-21 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	:P


[06-Nov-21 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	man


[06-Nov-21 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	buying FEO on the LM


[06-Nov-21 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so much easier


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You want some more?


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have 500 now lol


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm good for a while


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Sounds adequate


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	considering it 's only supplying 3 SME


[06-Nov-21 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Damn


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well honestly I have no feel for it. My EXT's keep up with a 1 a day FEO surplus


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	a stockpile that big on montem is impresive


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	didnt' realize how much of a supply on the LM there was


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	got 3x70 orders filled


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I just bought 100


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Put up buys, you'll be even more surprised


[06-Nov-21 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there usually isnt that big ofone


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's all of Montem, baby!


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I'm gonna be doing regular buying here probably


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	until I move my pp1 offworld


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	To less valuable real estate?


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yup


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And... ship the FE there?


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ironforge or vallis


[06-Nov-21 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	probably ironforge


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Vallis? That's arguably as good or better than Montem


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vallis will be either pp1 or something else that uses iron


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	FS, WEL, ASM


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	xeno are you guys selling FEO here now?


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	probably ASM


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
***zwulf** joined.*


[06-Nov-21 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I dunno, we probably could... let me check


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hmm I'll have to hit him up in a month or two


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	once I'm ready to settle it


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	just curious, seems like a hard time to get FEO here compared to vallis


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I got 300 FEO in like 3 days


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	surprised me tbh


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah no, we're a net consumer of FEO on Montem


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	probably because the planet is far from the cx


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	80 units a day it seems


[06-Nov-21 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so people don't wnat to ship it


[06-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Honestly, our FE operations are mostly on Vallis


[06-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you're mining FEO, for whatever reason


[06-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(and selling it without refining)


[06-Nov-21 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Only if a player with legacy FE operations joins us do we get them here.


[06-Nov-21 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well so are mine, thats where my FE smelting base is, just have a guy who struggles to get LM FEO orders filled here


[06-Nov-21 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so if theres a stockpile to be boiught i might have a buyer


[06-Nov-21 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	We mine 60 FEO a day on Montem. On Vallis it's ~2000 a day


[06-Nov-21 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow


[06-Nov-21 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	makes sense, just making sure I wasnt missing something


[06-Nov-21 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what do all of those fabs get used for?


[06-Nov-21 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they can't all get sold on the mkt


[06-Nov-21 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Honestly when FE became the metal nobody wants, I just started shipping it to Montem


[06-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I only have 5 SME's though


[06-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah i made a couple of our bases FE neutral for that reason


[06-Nov-21 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'd have to do a pretty deep dive to figure out where all the FEO goes... lol


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's like 1000-1600 fabs\day


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lots of fabs though. Any bfab order I place is filled in a day. Doesn't matter if it's a whole base or not.


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I know some guys went big on the UTS MM


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	One guy's got an extended permit with nothing but SME's on Vallis


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	WOW holy shit UTS you aren't fucking kidding


[06-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah before the nerf it was good money


[06-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	100-day @2500 ea


[06-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh they cried tears when the nerf hit


[06-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	250k inflation per day


[06-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's nuts


[06-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the whole FE market butt clenched


[06-Nov-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup... my base was filling up. Nobody on Vallis wanted FE. I only had a small production. My Vallis base started out vertical... I don't like it much


[06-Nov-21 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But anyways, I shipped it to Montem. There's guys here that use it, but not that many that folks thought to flood Montem with FE.


[06-Nov-21 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	what was once a smelting base became a bfab base


[06-Nov-21 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I don't know, I personally don't like fabs or metallurgy


[06-Nov-21 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Gonna make C for all those SME's


[06-Nov-21 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats why i have a HYF base here ;)


[06-Nov-21 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I have two INC's that I put in on a whim to be C independent right before the big C crunch. Quickly became my favorite product to sell, since I even had spare


[06-Nov-21 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh wow you HYF burnables?


[06-Nov-21 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yep, full tri burn


[06-Nov-21 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well shit, I wonder what the numbers on that are


[06-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	MAI on FRMs, HCP in HYF's and GRN/H20 on prom


[06-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Since RAT and DW took a crap, I pivoted my Verdant base to all burnables


[06-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hmmm HCP in the HYF's...


[06-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	If I need more crops I'll go settle Prom


[06-Nov-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i dont even grow crops there


[06-Nov-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Funny enough I grow burnables on Saladin in Outer Heaven. I may have found my niche


[06-Nov-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	What do you do on Prom then?


[06-Nov-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	just buy them dirt cheap from others, full RIG base


[06-Nov-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Buy dirt cheap crops... hmmm


[06-Nov-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I was gonna say you should rig base boucher instead, but no dirt cheap crops to buy!


[06-Nov-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the margin on H20 is better than the FRM area


[06-Nov-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Damn that's some cheap crops


[06-Nov-21 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and i have a buyer for 1500u/d and run the excess for my HYFs

**Xenogenic**:	Would a boucher base and just a Prom WAR be better though?


[06-Nov-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Anybody can remote buy stuff


[06-Nov-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	my buyer has a prob base


[06-Nov-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	prom*


[06-Nov-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well yeah, you could just keep it all for yourself


[06-Nov-21 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its more about cutting out the shipping cost


[06-Nov-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But you're still bringing it here?


[06-Nov-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im making that trip regardless


[06-Nov-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	frees up a ship to go elswhere


[06-Nov-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Okay I'm sure there's something I'm missing... but yeah it's late


[06-Nov-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	on a pure numbers play, youre right, but the logistics are more intensive


[06-Nov-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	If you're even in BEN, land on Katoa. Sweet deals on KOM and fuels


[06-Nov-21 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh I see, it'd be another planet to land on


[06-Nov-21 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah and LM makes life so much easier when shipping >10k water a week


[06-Nov-21 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That makes sense


[06-Nov-21 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hey can I ask you... weren't you guys gonna come to Outer Heaven?


[06-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	GDP?


[06-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there are some people headed that way


[06-Nov-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i think a few on saladin already


[06-Nov-21 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but there are some more important short term plans that got pushed up in front of that


[06-Nov-21 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Right. Yeah that happens


[06-Nov-21 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	were a lot smaller than SNF lol


[06-Nov-21 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	1 or 2 guys did come, it just seemed like it was gonna be more.


[06-Nov-21 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its on the roadmap, for sure


[06-Nov-21 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah I know. Was just hoping to have a few more butts in seats. And please not Saladin... we're gonna have more folks there than we really need.


[06-Nov-21 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	... which is a funny thing to say in a way. But the industrial worlds further west could use some more population


[06-Nov-21 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im really not that knowledgeable on those things, they have me focusing on the other big project


[06-Nov-21 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Sounds good. If anyone needs logistics help getting there I can help with that. I'd charge just fuel cost.


[06-Nov-21 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And you don't really need to keep a ship there... we have too many as is tbh


[06-Nov-21 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	good to know. heard some base materials were headed that way recently, so proabably another base or 2 coming soon


[06-Nov-21 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Cool, looking forward to you guys joining


[06-Nov-21 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well, more of you joining I should say


[06-Nov-21 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	might be a bit before i get out there, need to stabilize my new 3rd base first


[06-Nov-21 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but yeah, hope to see you on the frontier

[06-Nov-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a bad idea


[06-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Very bad


[06-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the TI deposits are not good


[06-Nov-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and also TIO.NC1 isn't that valuable


[06-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it is also a very expensive planet to build on (need INS and HSE)


[06-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, that too


[06-Nov-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I built a TIO mine as my third colony then abandoned it as soon as they enabled demolition of the bases


[06-Nov-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	Just got pro licence. Is taking on shipping contracts worth while if I have free ships or shouldnt I bother ?


[07-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	it depends on a few things


[07-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if you only have 1 planet than it is worth it to send your second ship on contracts


[07-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	because it does nothing most of the time


[07-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	than you need to look at current fuel prices and how much the route you are taking is making you


[07-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	in general ship decay is negilable my ships are going for more or less 24/7 and they lost 10% or so


[07-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Yeah because some of the contracts are so far away that I dont see how they could be making profits for me with the cost to get there and return back


[07-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	ship contracts are a bit micro intensive


[07-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like usally you fly around in outer space for 1-2days


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	my ships have 30 days of flight time


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they took 4% damage


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and 5%


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's pretty neglibile, though it isn't cheap to repair them


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you don't have to worry about it for a very long time


[07-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	several months


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like i said you make more money in the long run than any decay takes off off you


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I lied - they have 2 months of flight time each


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and are at 93%


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(I run them basically 24\7 lol)


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	@CptWaffles just look around some popular planets look at the fuel cost


[07-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if you make like 1k-2k its good


[07-Nov-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	better than a ship that is doing nothing


[07-Nov-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Yeah thats the thing, the adds up on montem for example make no money if im right. Now I could be doing it wrong though. But it seemed weird


[07-Nov-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	Like popular routes are montem/vallis > cxl and the other direction


[07-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	on YI-059 F are good contracts Verdant Celebdil


[07-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	even if you fly one route empty it might be worth it


[07-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	for example on Verdant is a 10k contract


[07-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	for Verdant > Celebil and from ther eyou can go back to moria system


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Can I look at the local market of a planet if I dont have a base there ?


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yes


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	why do people post these contracts on these empty planets


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rocketmanne**:	i gotta send a ship from here to moria station, its got about 300 tons free i am more than happy to take shipping contracts if anyone wants stuff moved


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	nobody will see them


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	you can accept contracts on planets you need a warehouse or a base to post one


[07-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	especially if one leg is going to montem


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	aaah that makes sense. Thanks guys !


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	question


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	some do it for corp trading


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if I abort a ship


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and the ship is heading to orbit


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	will it complete that orbit and jsut hang out there?


[07-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it won't return to where it started?


[07-Nov-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if you cancel a fligh there is a list of destinations where it goes to


[07-Nov-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it has to end up on a planet and such


[07-Nov-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[07-Nov-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and it will take the next destination in that list


[07-Nov-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like your flight route has a list of things i mean


[07-Nov-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh I see


[07-Nov-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[07-Nov-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and from that it will take the next destination as final


[07-Nov-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that'll work


[07-Nov-21 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Why is it that If i build buildings using materials that I mined and created myself it isnt "added" to the balance sheet of my company? Is that a bug or intentional


[07-Nov-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	oh @CptWaffles moria cxl has a local market where alot of shipping contracts for full ships are


[07-Nov-21 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rocketmanne**:	i gotta send a ship to the CX with a wee bit of empty cargo space. can I truck any cargo for anybody?


[07-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	@lowstrife we post shipping contracts on "empty" planets because it's free there


[07-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah but fees are 100


[07-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	not on every planet.


[07-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i would rather post on the moria cxl with higher visability than some random planet


[07-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	well maybe our definition of "empty" and "random" is not the same. I was thinking about posting on Verdant LM for example


[07-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I wouldn't post one on a resource planet 9 jumps away with 5 inhabitants though lol


[07-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah ok verdant is like populated but i know planets with like 5 members and 7k contracts


[07-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	those are kinda bizzare to me


[07-Nov-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	could be prearranged or intended for someone they know will check those places


[07-Nov-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	well i guess they have their reasons


[07-Nov-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	everyone who settles a random gg and posts ads there should obviously have someone to pick them up


[07-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyone have some STL (steel) to sell? I'm looking for like 12


[07-Nov-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Nov-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paulrik4444**:	as long as you can put up an ad to buy it. I'm just a plebe and I can't post ads.


[07-Nov-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	how much you want for it?


[07-Nov-21 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The "Health" fulfillment is hardcapped by the "Safety" fulfillment so I don't see the point in another infirmary


[08-Nov-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Actually it isn't.  Safety and health are both capped by life support.  They in turn both cap comfort.


[08-Nov-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Which caps culture, which caps education.


[08-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah yeah, you are correct, I forgot they are grouped into tiers


[08-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Correction, Comfort and culture are also a pair.


[08-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	They're both capped by safety and health.  In turn they both cap education.

**Madmanicus**:	on infrastructure safety station, built 5 and current 3. is the game recommending us to build 5 for full satisfaction? or 5 "building" already build but filled 1 gradually each week?


[09-Nov-21 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	5 are built, but only 3 actively working (either because just built since the most recent POPR or because manually deactivated by governor)


[09-Nov-21 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	there is no recommendation from the game :)

**Atomic97**:	Hi! Would anyone be interested in buying iron?


[09-Nov-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	Since the iron price has been rising in Montem, maybe I could give it for a lower price?


[09-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	Only 200 NCE per unit of iron :D


[09-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	I'll buy some FE. How much you got?


[09-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	I'm making some right now, so maybe about 20?


[09-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Perfect.


[09-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	I can have it ready in 1 day.


[09-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Works for me.


[09-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	200/u seems like a loss vOv


[09-Nov-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	really? The price for iron is 316 in montem


[09-Nov-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomic97**:	so it's really less


[09-Nov-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	its 1/3 of the price


[09-Nov-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that you throw out of the window


[09-Nov-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	remember that you need to pay for consumables and shipping fuel and some time later for building repairs


[09-Nov-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	I'll take 20 FE @ 275.00. Saves us both shipping it to and from the station.


[09-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Just posted ad on local market. Accept it to enter contract.


[09-Nov-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	They're right - 200/FE was too low for you. But I was just about to buy some at the station, so buying it from you saves us both shipping.


[09-Nov-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	both parks were built this week


[09-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm confused too


[09-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	everything was built this week


[09-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	welp, that was  a careless click


[09-Nov-21 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Did the devs accidentallly introduce a bug or change something without announcing it?


[09-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It looks like what things would be like with the two SSTs and park opperating at full strength for the week.


[09-Nov-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	But they didn't even exist for the full week.


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I finally got a bunch of techs


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Almost full


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	how many tech buildings did you have to tear down to get that?


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a miracle!


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I only moved the PHF to Vallis


[09-Nov-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might actually build the PP4 this week


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Need to see if I can feed it


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	PP4! that will never fill up


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was actually kind of hoping to be able to move a LAB off-world before I did that


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Oh, I don't have an engi building anyway


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or consumables for them


[09-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	ah


[09-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just didn't want to get deeper in a hole with techs when I started last week at 214/285


[09-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now I'm at 253/260


[09-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This is the closest to full I've been in two months


[09-Nov-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Maybe more?


[09-Nov-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I haven't been full since I built the TNP, and I tore that down a couple weeks ago after it lasted long enough to joke about it's "temporary" status


[09-Nov-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I still need to figure out the LAB move because that's going to take a fair bit of LDE and my WPLs aren't keeping up lately


[09-Nov-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but also SIO.NC1


[09-Nov-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess that's not good for the COLs


[09-Nov-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it means that nobody else can accept the ad and that both parties are now able to fulfill their ends. Once one end gets fulfilled it should shift to "partially fulfilled"


[10-Nov-21 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SHOTFUN**:	still need a lot more techs


[10-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	based on the trend we should be full here in 2 weeks, maybe 3 if somebody expands a bit


[10-Nov-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	Aah okay thanks !


[10-Nov-21 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	@Rubicate that's too optimistic :). As soon as there will be more Techs, there will be a LOT of new jobs. Many of us are blocked just by Techs availability.


[10-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	It is possible we get enough Techs with 3 Parks and some more SST, but not certain.

**FilthyPeasant**:	thank god my market chain doesnt require PG


[10-Nov-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or, there is a legitimate PG shortage: PG.IC1 // PG.CI1


[10-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	PG.CI1 still has a relatively large volume, so its a distribution problem most likely

[10-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	I smell a OVE price increase on the horizon


[10-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	I'm not so sure about that. it can be made out of PE instead. PWO, on the other hand...


[10-Nov-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah OVE is likely to not be affected as much, but PWO could take a turn up. Not as many people making OVE using the PG probably


[10-Nov-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	much cheaper to use RCO/PE unless you are making your own COT and keeping costs low

**FilthyPeasant**:	bias on my side kicked in as I am producing my own COT


[10-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	same here, making my own RCO and my own COT


[10-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	the COT/PG recipe is better


[10-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	...well, except if you're trying to buy COT at this ridiculous ask price


[10-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah buying COT on the CX to make OVE is not a profitable endeavor


[10-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	but if you buy COT at a reasonable price or make it yourself, it's much more profitable to make the OVE than RCO


[10-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	the best plan I think is just to buy my OVE/PWO....


[10-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I might be biased in that opinion though

**BluSham**:	who gets my taxe money?


[11-Nov-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BluSham**:	and can someone explain how corporations work pls?


[11-Nov-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	tax money goes to the Governor, currently Rubicate


[11-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	he puts that money towards infrastructure and upkeep for the buildings here on the planet to help population growth and happiness


[11-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	corps are basically groups of people who work together


[11-Nov-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	a lot of times corps will have lower prices for their members, and often try to work together and help each other out


[11-Nov-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	corps can also build corp projects that potentially help their members out too


[11-Nov-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BluSham**:	ok thanks!


[11-Nov-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no problem!


[11-Nov-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BluSham**:	do i need pro tho?


[11-Nov-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no you don't need pro to join a corp, but it makes it a lot easier to get the better prices through use of the LMs which need pro


[11-Nov-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	each corp runs things a little differently, so you'd need to check out specific ones to see if you like the fit of one. Most of the corps use discord to do a lot of their communication, although not a requirement either


[11-Nov-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BluSham**:	and how do i get more workforce?


[11-Nov-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	GTU is always welcoming new members in, so we'd be happy to have you if you are interested


[11-Nov-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	more workforce will come if they have HABs to live in and then have jobs to fill, so if you build habitations and then work buildings you should be able to get more workers, as long as there are workers available in the planet pool to come work for you


[11-Nov-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BluSham**:	ok thank u so much!


[11-Nov-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Montem has a solid population so you shouldn't have too much issue getting PIOs or SETs to come work for you


[11-Nov-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no problem!


[11-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	let's do a clothing sale! I will sell OVE (max 100/order) at 50/u, and PWO (max 50/order) at 120/u. Put up ads on the LM if you want some! otherwise it's all going to the CX tomorrow

[11-Nov-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My consumable bill is large


[11-Nov-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Ah, precious tax relief.


[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	now my buildings will run


[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that's nice.


[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I thought someone would buy the Carbon I put up a few days ago, but no


[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and then no one bought the PG either


[11-Nov-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	suddenly, I was in trouble.


[11-Nov-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Not accustomed to having the ships be this far apart. Going to have to alter some planning documents to prevent this kind of disaster from happening in the future

**shadowsneak**:	@MadMonk you know I'm loyal when I dont even check the CX when you post


[11-Nov-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I appreciate the business!


[11-Nov-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and PWO was higher than my ask price here at least earlier before I posted about it


[11-Nov-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	oh for sure


[11-Nov-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i just mean i didnt even check it to see if it was actually a deal or not


[11-Nov-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	just got you on the hook for regular buys :)


[11-Nov-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well if you ever need EXO, hit me up ;P


[11-Nov-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	will do, although I make it myself too


[11-Nov-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	make OVE/PWO/PT/EXO/REP all here


[11-Nov-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i may have accidentally made a HUGE stack forgetting about the recurring order


[11-Nov-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	lol oops! I mixed up PT and EXO quantities before and made way more EXO than I expected, thinking it was 5/batch like PT


[11-Nov-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yep, same haha


[11-Nov-21 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	cool >.> someone told me it rounded down ... turns out it rounds up


[11-Nov-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	back to the cxl i guess t


[11-Nov-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	thx for the spreadsheet


[11-Nov-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	yes they round up


[11-Nov-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	np


[11-Nov-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like 5 minutes after take off i double check


[11-Nov-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	not sure if i am smart or stupid


[11-Nov-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	depends if that 5 minutes is inside takeoff when you can still cancel and only lose that 5 minutes + another 5 to go back, or a day (:

[11-Nov-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hollo**:	if you were travelling inter-system and cancel before the jump, you won't lose much going back from orbit

**FilthyPeasant**:	that moment when you are looking at your expansion plan and think 'I am single handedly going to drive the price of H2O through the roof'


[11-Nov-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Water's too easy to overproduce.


[11-Nov-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It's not possible for anyone to singlehandedly shift the price that much.


[11-Nov-21 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	well temporary you can shift the price


[11-Nov-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	@FilthyPeasant squeeze the H2O market I dare you


[11-Nov-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that being said, I don't think its possible


[11-Nov-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	given im too poor to shotgun this development, i doubt i can squeeze H2O over its creation


[11-Nov-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	but a projected daily H2O demand nearing 4 digits daily makes me nervous given there's only 5k supply on NC1


[11-Nov-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Sounds like we need Advanced Resource Extraction buildings


[11-Nov-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	which is something I have been begging the devs for


[11-Nov-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	i'm gonna need a water colony at this rate


[11-Nov-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	a base ship only holds 5k/day just so you know


[11-Nov-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well, 5k/trip


[11-Nov-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	this is part of the reason i am nervous, logistically, on limited ships... this seems, nightmarish to commit after


[11-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i once thought about that, then decided it made more sense to source water from HRT


[11-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but yeah >1k/day water on montem just isnt a smart okay


[11-Nov-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	play*


[11-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you're running 1K daily water on Montem, you have made an error


[11-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm sorry.


[11-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but you have.


[11-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its not sustainable


[11-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	are you trying to run FP's or HYFs?


[11-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	neither is a great time on montem


[11-Nov-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	the answer to that question is: yes


[11-Nov-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	*I've made a terrible mistake.gif*


[11-Nov-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	run away run away run away


[11-Nov-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	bonus points if you know Arrested Development


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but seriously, i run 2 HYFs and 3 FRM's and thats enough of a H2O sink for me


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	i'm still kinda tempted to try to force this even though it is a very, very, stupid idea


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	because money


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	because COF?


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	COF is most of it


[11-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you fool x) not on montem


[11-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or do it...but know it will be pain and suffering


[11-Nov-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	i think this is probably going to be a do it until it either breaks me, or breaks H2O, then restructure


[11-Nov-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	since i'm already 1 foot in the grave


[11-Nov-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	*grabs popcorn* *flies in more H2O*


[11-Nov-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	maybe settle a RIG base on Verdant and then run this plan, then you can support yourself with your own h2o


[11-Nov-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	eh, its gonna be... two* ish months before this monster is fully online, given how poor i am


[11-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	Verdant was the plan, although i wish i had more ships


[11-Nov-21 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	does somehave have 3 aef i can buy i pay more if the ad is not enough


[11-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, 1k water daily is kind of heavy


[11-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You could try a -1k water base on Verdant and find someone running a water base to supply you


[11-Nov-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but shipping all that to Montem would be a pain


[11-Nov-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also no agri CoGC here


[11-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I want to do something like that on prom


[11-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and make ALL THE FOODS


[11-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and on Danakill too actually


[11-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have rigs there which get most of my water needs, but still have to import some


[11-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	would be nice to just replace them


[11-Nov-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I make lots of food on Verdant, but it's actually kind of dumb


[11-Nov-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	taking up space I could be using for agriculture I mean


[11-Nov-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but there's not really a planet nearby I can offload food processing to :(


[11-Nov-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, no shipping capacity from me


[11-Nov-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I could see pulling something like that off with Prom/Avalon and a glass ship


[11-Nov-21 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hortus also has useful gas giants


[11-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow that's a very good idea lol


[11-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	why didn't I examine avalon better... I had it planned out as a manu base


[11-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah that pairing works much betterer


[11-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I spent a lot of the early game not knowing it existed


[11-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I feel like if I started fresh now my colonies would be in different places


[11-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yikes though holy moley


[11-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you want to run it at 500 area? with 26fp?


[11-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	538m and 518t import per day lol


[11-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	1250 h2O


[11-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	per


[11-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	day


[11-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	all farms?


[11-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or hyfs rather?


[11-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or is that for the fp?


[11-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just for the FP lol


[11-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like, my Verdant base might have been better on Prom


[11-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well, worse CoGC


[11-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but multiple usable planets in the same system


[11-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	enough to justify a glass ship


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	wow


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Small amounts of local N  that might be enough to only have to ship in LST


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and you need prom basically nothing but rigs


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to supply that much water


[11-Nov-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Just don't make that much DW?


[11-Nov-21 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	DW.NC1 RAT.NC1


[11-Nov-21 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I mean you need RAT and DW


[11-Nov-21 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if it's gonna be a good base

[11-Nov-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**aeryen**:	hollo: if you were travelling inter-system and cancel before the jump, you won't lose much going back from orbit <- except, I did that, and the ship jumped regardless and that is the intended way. on top of that, it does not have a target in that system anymore, so it will just jump to ANY random point in the system :(


[12-Nov-21 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Nov-21 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Forseral**:	@doggos314: You can reasonably expect RAT to rise back up toward about 70-75 before the next crash, I think. We've had notable shocks on both the supply and demand side here, as players arrive and depart from both the game and the market.

[15-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	will list the specific hours


[15-Nov-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and if you have multiple buildings in that field, it goes faster since it's total hours


[15-Nov-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so 2 buildings would earn it twice as fast


[15-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	thats alot of hours for t5, only thing unclear here, but i can guess, are experts global, or per base


[15-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	i assume per base


[15-Nov-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	they are specific to each base


[15-Nov-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	can't be transferred, and must be earned separately for each base


[15-Nov-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

Study: Ship Crews Re-Directed 28% of the Time
An analysis by the Center For Galactic Studies shows that, on 28% of all industrial ship flights, the crew isn’t sure why they are even going that way. The study gathered data from hundreds of flight crews, who all gave a consistent picture of pointless turnarounds and empty cargo holds. One pilot, who wished to remain anonymous, told the follow...

**MadMonk21**:	Alright Montem, I think going forward I am going to offer/accept offers for OVE for anything at or above 50/u, and PWO for anything at or above 120/u, as long as I have stock or can fulfill within the designated time. So feel free to just post whenever you need some and I'll see what I can do. If you are going to want larger orders, send me a DM beforehand or put longer times on it to help! Thanks!

[16-Nov-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I strive to be at the bottom of the pyramid


[16-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I was thinking of running some inbetwen building a LAB and going for a big boy building


[16-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	MG, C, PG, bfabs, LST, BER, BTS, SIO, MCG


[16-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and some MGS


[16-Nov-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's all I sell


[16-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	you still thinking of getting an AML?


[16-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yes


[16-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	nice


[16-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Right now the plan is to get the AML and use the BE internally to continue to sell into the Capacitor MMs


[16-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's a pretty good scheme right there


[16-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but if the CBx MMs get to be unprofitable for us, I will likely make a SME + WEL and create THPs from the CF


[16-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I was also thinking of getting one, but it's definitely going to take a while to work up the money for that...


[16-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Look at the CXOB for AFabs in Moria


[16-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	the rfabs alone for the HB4 cost as much as a new base


[16-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep, it's a big investment


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, I saw all your buys


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	AML + Habs is about 900K


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	oof


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but I'm sure the BE will be worth it


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and selling the SI and AL on the side is pretty good too


[16-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Ubersmench and @Lovehungusall is the BER worth it =)


[16-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm sure the fact that I have two buyers on the planet for advanced materials is indicative that it's very worth it.


[16-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	true


[16-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I was thinking of either going BE or TA


[16-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	because I'm pretty sure with the expanding tech sector SC is quite profitable


[16-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	SC is already produced in large quantities in Antares


[16-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Granted, with the tech population going up you may be right


[16-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you wanted, you could buy BTS from me and refine Tungsten


[16-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It would be a slow payoff, but it would come.


[16-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it's a very interesting building


[16-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh definitely


[16-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the fact that most of its recipes produce a high-tech element and low-tech metals is unique


[16-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'm throwing up a LAB later today, so hopefully that will help a lot with making money


[16-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and quite frankly, is the paradigm I would like to see followed for Resource Extraction


[16-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	For example, take the CHP


[16-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That LST -> CA recipe could go into a tier 2 resource extraction building


[16-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	same thing with HAL -> NA CL


[16-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	MGS -> MG should come out of the BMP and into something like a basic refiner


[16-Nov-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I see, that would be pretty nice. A settler building that does refining, and sometimes you get a little extra out of it, definitely not as good as AML, but still some benefits


[16-Nov-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My concern is more about the Resource Extraction expert line


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and the industry as a whole


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it ends at pioneers


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It starts and ends at Pios


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	anyone got TRU i can buy


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Fuel Refining has the same issue


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	I need 8


[16-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	only one building uses it


[16-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, it would be nice if they either lumped the REF in with chemistry, or changed the experts so they covered something else


[16-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	When they add Power to the game fuel refining will get some love I assume


[16-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's going to be a while


[16-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If ever


[16-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, we'll see


[16-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	not to be super pessimistic but I'm starting to feel like the devs don't have their focus on expanding core gameplay depth and are too focused on presentation. Maybe faction contracts are going to be a cool addition, but I still think there are underlying design decisions that need to be fixed


[16-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think the past "x" time has been focused on the mobile UI


[16-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	now 225 / 225


[17-Nov-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	also posted 2 shipments to go from here to MOR CX, and one to go from here to Vallis


[17-Nov-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	800ncc for 500t for moria --> vallis? that doesn't even cover the one-way fuel costs dude


[17-Nov-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	Drastic your shipping orders are VASTLY underpriced


[17-Nov-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it costs 115 SF to get there in 24hr

[17-Nov-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	190 m3, 199t available


[17-Nov-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	departs in 5 minutes


[17-Nov-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	excuse me!


[17-Nov-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	montem --> moria


[17-Nov-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	low demand route so you can pay whatever you want


[17-Nov-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Sounds like I need to just ship it all myself then. Thanks for the heads up


[17-Nov-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I wont clutter up your screen any more ;)


[17-Nov-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	loool my screen is never cluttered :D


[17-Nov-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah that needs to be at least 2000ncc per shipload


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	maybe more since the planets are just in an awful posistion right now and there's no return loads


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(presuming it's open mkt orders and not inter-corp)


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	oof. Ill check back in next week


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Gotta time the orders for the orbits.


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yup


[17-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Just learning that now... Im lord scrub


[17-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah use the blueprint to run your own estimate on what the actual costs are


[17-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and price accordingly


[17-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and there's a shortage of shipping in general in the galaxy


[17-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so yeah rates have to be fairly high right now imo


[17-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I need a "post this ad for the usual shipping price" button.


[17-Nov-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	How long do the orbits generally take to sync up again?


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	If we are at the worst time, then that should be about half of a cycle, right?


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think moria and montem have a 30 day orbital resonance?


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I don't know how montem and vallis are


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it's longer


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	montem is getting closer to vallis now though


[17-Nov-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it will take weeks until they are at their closest a pproach I think


[17-Nov-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	probably 1.5 weeks until they are close again


[17-Nov-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if i remember correctly


[17-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Thats a good enough estimate for me


[17-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Ill be back to nuke the LM at that point >:D

[17-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Montem is like a quarter circle away from the station not on the opposite side


[17-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's more of an average time


[17-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and getting closer


[17-Nov-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Same with Vallis


[17-Nov-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In a week or so both will be super close I think?

[17-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep


[17-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm not a charity (most of the time)


[17-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I expect none.


[17-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i here i wanted to offer you 100k ncc oh well


[17-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I wouldn't want to feel obligated to do you favors later


[17-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	even if you offered it, I wouldn't take it


[17-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I was surprised when you picked up one of my contracts.


[17-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I kinda expected those to go to new players.


[17-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	fuel?


[17-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I needed one on the planet to get off to the CX


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I did a maximum burn


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Didn't think there'd be many veterans who could do several day long shipment runs to resource taps.


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh that one.


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I did that specifically for you


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You picked up 500 AMM for me once.


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I was very surprised.


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I figured that bringing the AMM in would help with fuel availability


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	They are quite generous contracts though.


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and it was something I was concerned about


[17-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Well I already had 1000 units at Benten.


[17-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh.


[17-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	A lot of that AMM just gets dumped to the mm.


[17-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh...


[17-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	well, I was trying to do a thing


[17-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Yeah... a lot of those shipments are just to give some cash to new players since the AMM isn't of much value.


[17-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Later when I do a trip myself I turn the money into BDEs or plastics or something, then resell them at Moria to convert the cash to NCC.


[17-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The AMM actually needed goes to Moria.


[17-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would have brought it


[17-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just had an idle ship and wanted to help a fellow conspirator


[17-Nov-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I haven't dumped it yet.


[17-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I haven't had a chance to get a ship over to Benten yet.


[17-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Actually you can see the 1500 AMM on the Benten exchange right now.


[17-Nov-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	64% of Benten's AMM is mine.


[17-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	need 1 OVE


[17-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	I won't be flying out for another 4-6 days


[17-Nov-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so if you feel like running it in 48+ hours, it'll be there.


[17-Nov-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[17-Nov-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to buy? or to ship


[17-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you're going to buy it, you'd have to ship it to Verdant first for me to sell it to you


[17-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but I would sell it to you at Verdant for 88 each


[17-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if you're handling the logistics, you should make the profit


[17-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because I'm about a week away from needing some


[17-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	are you not going to put the LM on 280 anymore?


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	No, I am


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or is that 4-6 days out


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ahh


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's just 4-6 days out


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	one ship is tied up for the next 4 days


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	one ship gets back in about 56 hours


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Might be a little tight-ish


[17-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Want to play it by ear as we get closer?


[17-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah. ping me tomorrow. I am interested in buying it


[17-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or rather - if you don't have a shipper\buyer in 24hr


[17-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'll take it


[17-Nov-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Sure thing. I have two full ships available there


[17-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	k


[17-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm probably going to sell ~100, use the rest


[17-Nov-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fwiw


[17-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	We'll see if anyone wants to pick it up: LMA MOR/1809


[17-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If they do, I'll be listing that on the CX


[17-Nov-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	k that's fine


[17-Nov-21 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	otherwise, that's the contract for you


[17-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it has a 2D life on the CX


[17-Nov-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm assuming the price is fair/agreeable


[17-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it'll be gone by then


[17-Nov-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	let's just do another one in another day


[17-Nov-21 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	OK


[17-Nov-21 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if I decide to run peak MGS production, I can vomit out like 140 per day


[17-Nov-21 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	thats.. alot of MG, does the demand at that volume even exist?


[17-Nov-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	enough to make 42,000 PG\day


[17-Nov-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	moria trades 5k\day


[17-Nov-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	you mean you don't need casual 160 LSE :P ?


[18-Nov-21 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	anyhow, I have 25 POLs churning out PG constantly here, so if you (or anyone else reading this) needs some PG, feel free to hit me up


[18-Nov-21 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah, so that's why PG didn't spike after jacuribu quit


[18-Nov-21 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	I actually haven't sold more than ~4k on the CX


[18-Nov-21 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean, I stopped buying PG and started making my own


[18-Nov-21 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I assume you sell in corp?


[18-Nov-21 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	yeah, I'm too lazy to bother with the CX mostly


[18-Nov-21 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	I will at some point have HSEs again, but I've generally been charging 9.5k


[18-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm not sure I can justify that until the current INS.NC1 shortage ends


[18-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	is the shortage there just people producing it, or is it inputs?


[18-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think there was an AR shortage for awhile


[18-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the price was super low


[18-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so people may have torn down their PP3s


[18-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Either that or demand spiked due to the various colonial projects


[18-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I put up 360 at 200/u thinking it might slowly get sold to people making REP in small batches


[18-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and instead it all vanished in less than an hour


[18-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the opportunity cost of using PP3s for anything else right now is massive


[18-Nov-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also REP.NC1 is about to run out


[18-Nov-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which would be real bad


[18-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that would be really bad


[18-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	ohh i always forget that REP use INS


[18-Nov-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Raigir**:	just had to repair mine


[18-Nov-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Raigir**:	they've been running for more than 80d


[18-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's 250 SIO spoken for. There's not much left


[18-Nov-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My other concern is HMS.NC1


[18-Nov-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My competition seems to have given up


[18-Nov-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I was going to tear down the CLF for extra space on Prism, but now I don't think I can do that


[18-Nov-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've raised the price in an effort to avoid having all my stock bought out, but half of that 100 I listed still got bought almost instantly


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I actually have less than 100 HMS on hand for the first time in months


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Price ladder it next time


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, might have to do that


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it would help you see what people really think it's worth


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think with things like REP and HMS it would best to have some small amounts at high prices so that the supply never gets fully bought out


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	though with a severe shortage, it may be buying because of perceived lack of future supply


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Possibly


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Prices are worse at other CXs?


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Let's find out:


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	INS.NC1 // INS.CI1 // INS.IC1 // INS.AI1


[18-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's pretty much universally bad.


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Antares is an outlier, but there's no supply and the highest ask is 200


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The thing is I'm pretty sure I don't have an INS monopoly


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You probably don't, but what you are doing is selling it publicly


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I can't produce enough to supply a new colony project more often than once per a few days


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It may be that most INS consumption / production is happening off the CX


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I could keep REP manufacturing supplied


[18-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but INS may be just be getting snapped up at any price


[18-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... maybe not


[18-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	REP at 500 isn't worth making if INS is at 200


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	of course REP supply is down to 13


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and that's all I'm willing to sell for now


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I should have saved more of that INS and sent it off to Prism to make into REP :(


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess the next batch will be reserved to make sure the REP production doesn't slow


[18-Nov-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Was kind of hoping not to have to fly back there for a few days


[18-Nov-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... I seem to have run out of TI on Vallis


[18-Nov-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Looks like it would be a good time to add a tech hab to Vallis.


[18-Nov-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I actually have full techs there


[18-Nov-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although I employ fewer there


[18-Nov-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Might be time to get rid of those SMEs that are just taking up space


[18-Nov-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Or maybe move my GFs to Kiruna where they would benefit from the CoGC sometimes


[18-Nov-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though they'd lose the benefits of experts

[19-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	Hehe. Just wondering


[19-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	well I apparently only unloaded half of my ship at the CX instead of all of it, so I have 250 N to sell here on Montem. let me know if you want any!


[19-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Someone had a BUY for 1000N earlier


[19-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that is there for quite some time


[19-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and get an STL ship to service it and montem


[20-Nov-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fun times


[20-Nov-21 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	As much as I complain, I mostly serve 7 colonies with just 2 ships


[20-Nov-21 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Then again, none of the colonies is allowed to produce too much in the way of bulk goods anymore


[20-Nov-21 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like I could pump out a ton of H and AR, but I wouldn't be able to ship it


[20-Nov-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I'm working on my first ship. I'm already in Metallurgy, Construction, and Plastics, but I'll need someone for the electronics and ADR. Someone around here have the capacity to make SAR, RAD, and BMF?


[20-Nov-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Who do I court for the difficult electronics?


[20-Nov-21 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	LST soon to hit MM ish prices


[20-Nov-21 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	expect people to demolish their EXTs


[20-Nov-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	prices back up in ~ 4-5 weeks


[20-Nov-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	also, if you've reserved SIO from me, the ship is 1D + 20h out


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hmm that's annoying


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	7 colonies? I could never on 2ships


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	without contracts


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for the bulk stuff


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but 4 of my planned colonies are in mor\hrt, so they can be served by STL ships entirely


[20-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	almost entirely*


[20-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	We got a guy with 9 colonies. And yeah some of them are totally stranded without public shipping


[20-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and reduced in complexity in what they can make


[20-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	easier to public ship lots of one thing


[20-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vs. lots of many thing


[20-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	s


[20-Nov-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was selling excess SAR earlier and ADRs, but I don't really have surpluses anymore


[20-Nov-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but if you put in a bid for .01 higher than the min on ADRs, you should get one from someone eventually


[20-Nov-21 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	^ this is my backup plan


[20-Nov-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might be able to make an ADR


[20-Nov-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Nov-21 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's quite a lot of LST


[22-Nov-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I have a lot of CHP


[22-Nov-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Anyone have some STL? I'm shifting into making BHP and forgot to grab some of the market. Would like to start producing today and not tomorrow :P


[22-Nov-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can always put up an order that's like CX+20% and someone will likely fill it


[22-Nov-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but no guarantee


[22-Nov-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Oh, I know. Wanted to test the waters and see if someone was producing


[22-Nov-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I could make some if I imported a ton of Oxygen


[22-Nov-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it wouldn't be ready for quite some time though


[22-Nov-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and as I only run one lowly SME, I think you would need someone with more oomph


[22-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	hahaha, no. I dont' think I'll need more than 4 a day


[22-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Vallis probably has a smelter running FE -> STL


[22-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Oh, I know they do. But by throwing up this message, it'll also get more people to look at the LM and maybe fill it :P


[22-Nov-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	@Cygal I've a small amount of Steel here for Rfabs, so Can fill an ad for 4, if you need it.


[22-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that is a surprise no one talks about


[25-Nov-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and also taught me the location from where you buy the ship materials matters quite a lot lol


[25-Nov-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	A standard glass ship takes 2 ship loads of cargo to construct at Pallada, remember to bring fuel for the new ship on the way back. Pallada is quite far off.


[25-Nov-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You can commit the stuff to the shipyard project, like any planetary project or your HQ.


[25-Nov-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So you only need to send a single ship twice.


[25-Nov-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The 700k NCC upfront cost for the materials to build the ship is a little more daunting.


[25-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	-+


[25-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Though expect to pay more, either because you need to run buildings on shipbuilding stuff for extended periods of time or because people charge a premium for having done so themselves.


[25-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Heh, the more I mess with the numbers the closer I get to 650k.

**Kazzanka**:	New player question: What's with the max tonnage, 1.00 NCC shipping contracts on the local market right now?  It feels like it


[25-Nov-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kazzanka**:	it's meant to trick newer players, but I'm hoping there's something to those that I'm missing.


[25-Nov-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	usally things that are traded very high or very low are often internal corps trading


[25-Nov-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	or it could be an error he didnt notice


[25-Nov-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	or its a pre negotiate trade


[25-Nov-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and thats the govern of our planet so i you can be sure that this is not some kind of scam


[25-Nov-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Ah, sorry, those 1 NCC contracts are mine Kazzanka, I'll explain why I made them


[25-Nov-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I have some corporation allies who are helping me move some commodities, they are taking those contracts


[25-Nov-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I will then later pay them in another way


[25-Nov-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	Anyone want something shipped to Moria station in like 2-3h ?


[25-Nov-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I really should just break down and build a STO here


[25-Nov-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I keep juggling resources trying to tell myself that I'll eventually not need more than 1500t


[25-Nov-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I gave up after going up to 750 area capacity.


[25-Nov-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm planning on building a STO on most of my planets


[25-Nov-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	using a warehouse is just ugly, to have to keep shuffling too to-from there


[25-Nov-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	at most you could rent a warehouse and store planetary exports there


[25-Nov-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just as a nice segmented place


[25-Nov-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	At this point I have STOs on most planets.


[25-Nov-21 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I like the warehouse, but not so much as extra storage


[25-Nov-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I tend to put stuff I want to ship away there, so that when the ship comes I can just load it up without having to think about it right then


[25-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I may end up doing that eventually


[25-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	would be awesome if you could toggle buildings to output to the warehouse directly for exports


[25-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ooo


[25-Nov-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	now that's a good idea


[25-Nov-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	If I would like to start a second base on a planet without population. Approx how much more will that cost compared to building second base on already established planet. Will prob only need pioneers. Cant seem to find any resources about this


[27-Nov-21 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you get a bonus called settlers grace or something like that to combat the biggest issue


[27-Nov-21 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it takes a really long time for the population to grow


[27-Nov-21 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would recommend against doing that for your 2nd base


[27-Nov-21 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you may also have to build population infrastructure too - SST most likely


[27-Nov-21 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you want to grow it to ful lsize


[27-Nov-21 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Aaah yes I see. So also for smaller populated worlds. It might be a hassle to get a larger workforce


[27-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	you most likely need to lure alot of pop with open jobs


[27-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	and usually the planets that are settle are those who have some kind of value


[27-Nov-21 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like most if not all of the planets that matter for early/mid game should have been settled


[27-Nov-21 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Yeah I was looking at for example planets with large N / HAL / CLI / BOR deposits since they seem fairly profitable. But also very high cost then


[27-Nov-21 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah throwing down COL on gg costs around 250k-300k which is alot for new players


[27-Nov-21 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i think there are some good sio planets


[27-Nov-21 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Hmm I see. Those arent that expensive indeed


[27-Nov-21 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	GG seemed very cool But 300k is  quite a stretch


[27-Nov-21 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-21 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-21 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At least the supply is almost enough for a decent colony now


[27-Nov-21 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-21 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	nobody is gonna buy the FEO


[01-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	why would you pay thousands to ship it out


[01-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vs. buying it on the cx


[01-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they would just use it locally on TO392


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or better yet - mining it locally in moria and using it on the planet


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	LST could be viable if the price rises as supply ebbs and flows


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and CLI sure is viable


[01-Dec-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but FEO nah


[01-Dec-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and take 0.4% damage which is 400ncc in damage alone, plus additional fuel having to land on two planets


[01-Dec-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	effective cost of FEO is 65\u to get it to montem or vallis


[01-Dec-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Talmar**:	SNF is making STL Glass ships. We've made over a dozen of them now, I believe. I know I have one :)


[02-Dec-21 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	You should come to our Discord and ask about them. I'm sure the people that are making them will give you all of the details.


[02-Dec-21 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	FTL Ships won't be available until we start getting more Scientist, as they are needed to produce the more complex parts

[03-Dec-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I won't take a contract for less than 3/t/m3 for local, or less than 8/t/m3 for other system, no matter how empty I am. Otherwise you just keep encouraging these people to underbid the fair price.


[03-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	3/t/m3 is still low for in system, for most people I'd say 5 is standard


[03-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-21 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	wtf


[06-Dec-21 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	oh the raw material price for 1 DEC is 6900 already


[06-Dec-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So they shouldn't go for much more than that


[06-Dec-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	well you need 12h of a POL to produce it


[06-Dec-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	yeah, but that's less than the POL time that goes into either the EPO or PG in them


[06-Dec-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Realistically about 40h of POL time and some C, MG, CL, O, and H


[06-Dec-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	well its less the cost and more the opportunity cost you are losing


[06-Dec-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like in the time you make DEC for "free" you could run more profitable things


[06-Dec-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	PG and EPO are both wanted in other industries, so the fact that they don't get made much isn't surprising and that would drive the price up (also, why are we making DEC in a POL? seems like a BMP thing)


[06-Dec-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No, but I mean 12h of POL time is what 1k tops?


[06-Dec-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	but 12k definitely sounds too much for a DEC


[06-Dec-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	like i said there is like nothing on the cxl's


[06-Dec-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so endless demand vs no supply = price shock


[06-Dec-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Presumably you'd want a contract to make them, and at that point it becomes a lot more like selling EPO and PG in bulk


[06-Dec-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	wtf is going on with H2O.NC1 i'm going to starve at that price


[06-Dec-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Every once in awhile the cheap water dries up and then people shipping it in make a killing for a bit until the market is overflowing with it again


[06-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	*stares at water stockpile and tries not to sell it all*


[06-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	all the more reason for me to set up a damned waterbase >.> this is what i get for 250 h20 demand a day


[06-Dec-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah 132/d is the limit for me


[06-Dec-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	any more and id be running in water nonstop


[06-Dec-21 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's a lot of water to ship in


[06-Dec-21 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I try to keep my water-intensive things on Verdant


[06-Dec-21 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Though I guess half my bases use a bit of water at least


[06-Dec-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that is the long term plan actually, going to just outsource my C production to verdant


[06-Dec-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ooh, that's even heavier to ship


[06-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah, thats why im here so far :D


[06-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My C production is only XG-452f


[06-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and it only supplies that base


[06-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also... I'm not sure I recommend making your C on a cold gas giant


[06-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	sounds horridly temperature inefficent


[06-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	at least you dont have to heat your buildings lol


[06-Dec-21 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, once your HQ upgrades get expensive, leaving unused space on bases seems more wasteful than farming on a GG


[06-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats a big oof


[06-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Only need one HYF to feed 5 incs


[06-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which feed 7 POLs


[06-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which then make me not have to ship as much H


[06-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	true, when throughput isnt the goal


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FilthyPeasant**:	im my case, started on montem as a food producer, i'm half tempted to rip everything down and move it all to verdant


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean the goal is maximizing the value of 500t/500m3


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	meanwhile i have 3 HYFs feeding 4 INCs on the tri-burn


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and PG is a lot better than H


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, the tri-burn just makes no sense to me


[06-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since HYFs can't make GRN


[06-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might need to redo the math and do the MAI/HCP burn


[06-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I seem to remember that was actually more efficient


[06-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah, its more complex, i use the hyfs for HCP, MAI on farms and just buy GRN and ship it in


[06-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I do the HCP only burn to minimize inputs, but I don't think I actually need to do that unless the base's inputs are more than the outputs


[06-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	would not reccommend on a GG with limited space


[06-Dec-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but i also make 60 C/d


[06-Dec-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I only need to make 3C/ d per POL


[06-Dec-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So like 21


[06-Dec-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'll have to redo the planning once I get home


[06-Dec-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so much effort just to make PG


[06-Dec-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If I were a fuel refiner, NAB would compact H down a lot more efficiently


[06-Dec-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I wouldn't make the BOR or NA locally


[06-Dec-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah.... a few more HQ upgrades into the future, and I'll be eyeing space on TO-392d again


[06-Dec-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or tearing that base down to free up a permit


[06-Dec-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	one of those two

**Nocknuck**:	no clue


[07-Dec-21 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	Atomic97, it's very easy to spam make new accoutns and give your company free money in this game, that's why the developers have restricted money-giving transactions to PRO accounts only


[09-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	so with your free accounts loans or gifts will be impossible


[09-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	That being said, even if you had a PRO account, people hoard their wealth like dragons in this game, few would even consider giving you 5000 NCC


[09-Dec-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I can give you some money making advice though


[09-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	right now MCG is sold for 17.4 bucks here on Moria CX, but it's sold for 24.26 bucks on Hortus CX, meaning each MCG you ship over with a spaceship earns you 6.8 bucks. One spaceship can hold 2083 MCG, so that gives a profit potential of 14164 bucks per trip.


[09-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The issue is that you do require some capital to be able to afford the MCG when you buy it on Moria though


[09-Dec-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but trades like that can be a good way to earn money


[09-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah, and even better if you can find a similar trade going back the other way to take all your cash back into NCC


[09-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	one free WAI to all companies on Montem to make up for yesterday


[09-Dec-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats some crazy cheap LST

[09-Dec-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It is, gotta convince the competition to shut down every now and then. Sell it on HRT or something.


[09-Dec-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	if I had a use for it I would buy some, but I don't here


[09-Dec-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and don't feel like shipping it off somewhere


[09-Dec-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	last time the planets aligned i shipped over 1k to Vallis


[09-Dec-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I ship probably 600 to Vallis daily


[09-Dec-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	someone needs a heavy hauler


[09-Dec-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats a LOT of LST


[09-Dec-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup and yup


[09-Dec-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Funny thing, I'm the smaller if the two SNF LST producers


[09-Dec-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats crazy


[09-Dec-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I'm assuming thats a dedicated glass ship running that route


[09-Dec-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	Is your montem base only extractors?


[09-Dec-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup, 2 permits of EXT's


[09-Dec-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	Wow


[09-Dec-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	We move it all via public shipping


[09-Dec-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Misteryonathan** left.*


[09-Dec-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats impressive


[09-Dec-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	whats the typical rate for a full ship on that route?


[09-Dec-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im guessing thats the 1.05k ads


[09-Dec-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	at 6/u in shipping thats not terrible


[09-Dec-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	unit cost, not shipping rate


[09-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm impressed that it's worth shipping nowadays


[09-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yo @CaptainIncognito you got any HMS that you can sell?


[09-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No :(


[09-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	damn


[09-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've been on vacation and the already questionable logistics of my HMS chain broke down


[09-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well... unless you want to buy them on Prism


[09-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, that would be problematic


[09-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I need to get more GC over there


[09-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so I might have the 40 HMS from there to the CX in 1-2 days


[09-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I really need to figure out a better long term solution though


[09-Dec-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was in the middle of winding down and tearing down my CLF when all the other suppliers dried up


[09-Dec-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I used to run a SME and CHP over there to help make the IND


[09-Dec-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	now it's a haphazard process


[09-Dec-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	sounds like it


[09-Dec-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My IND gets made on TO-392d sometimes


[09-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	because... uh, yeah


[09-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well that CHP was making FLX


[09-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and that's just not super worth it on a high pressure low temp planet in the best of times


[09-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FLX.NC1


[09-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but definitely not now


[09-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	disgusting


[09-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	All my chemistry planets are far away


[09-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and also busy making other things


[09-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	One of them doesn't even run a CHP


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I actually used to have a CHP on almost every base


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I tore down the Verdant ones too


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I can't really blame you for that one. CHPs are kinda either really good, or not that good


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	going to just ship in the NS now


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, as I get more bases, I need to specialize them more


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	without completely driving myself insane


[09-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	every shipment is like 20 different goods


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	oof


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that logistics must be a nightmare


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	makes this game take way too much attention


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It kind of is


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it's not great when I'm at home


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Figuring out what I need with a tiny laptop screen


[09-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well, it kind of makes me want to shut some bases down, and just expand a few to 1000 area


[09-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'd take that tiny laptop screen over trying to do that on a phone


[09-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	just for simplicity


[09-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	oh yeah, way better


[09-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I also don't want to mess up the UI I set up for my desktop


[09-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I should make a separate set of screens for the laptop resolution


[09-Dec-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	probably


[09-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	for me my big pileups happen when I have to work


[09-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	pretty much only have time to get on, go through notifications, fill existing contracts, then leave. Wake up, make lunch, check PRUN, go to work, come home, check prun, go to sleep, rinse repeat. Thankfully it's 4 days at a time at most


[09-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but I didn't notice how low on HMS i was running, and I'm sure if I had taken care of that a couple days ago...


[09-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I ran out of C H and MG while Montem was down and AL is down to 10 :(


[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I was going to send a ship over last night


[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I got really lucky I didn't run out of anything while that was happening


[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now instead I had to send both...


[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also my PP4 queue ran out


[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since I don't have that one on repeat


[09-Dec-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well that's shitty


[09-Dec-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	paying those engineers to do a whole lot of nothing


[09-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well, luckily I don't employ any yet


[09-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that's probably the next step


[09-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	ah, that's good


[09-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which won't be great for my poor CLF


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	... I might have to run a second one


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	for the HSS?


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well I'm not making enough HMS


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	trying to figure out if that's because the CLF isn't running all the time


[09-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or if it just can't keep up


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I feel like I'd need like 1.3 or 1.5 CLFs


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	2 is overkill


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Prism does have 4 manufacturing experts


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... I could scrap most of the rest of my extraction there


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well if you make a second one, and have it switch off between HSS and HMS, it will probably be sufficient


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I don't really need to sell HE to the MM


[09-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I don't think I need much prod time for HSS


[09-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	not yet


[09-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although I need engis on 3 bases now


[09-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	damn. I know you have a PP4, what else you got?


[09-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	2 DRS and an AML


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	AML for BE for capacitors?


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that was the theory


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although in practice, I might need to make TA for SC


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since those are also hard to get


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	they are. My problem with TA is I know where to get TAI


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I just don't want to do it


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the BER supply is low


[09-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just bought the TAI


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	you need so little for SC, it's worth overpaying for


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	fair enough


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like back when I paid 3k per unit of TCO


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which is stupid high


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but also... worth it


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and eventually the upkeep for the engineers will outpace the material cost


[09-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I don't have any of the engi habs built yet


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that's the next step I think


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	like I know I could go and get TAI for probably a third of the current price


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but I don't have the logistic support for that


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and I don't want to use a base permit just to throw down an extractor


[09-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	emphasis on "an"


[09-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[09-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's my issue with a few things


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	N, CU, etc.


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well N is back down


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	shits heavy


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'd be much more likely to secure my own BER


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Then maybe just use it to make my electronics


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and either sell BE or hit up another MM


[09-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or make hot planet settlement stuff


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	or you could make W and sell it to nobody for a long ass time


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh... the BE is another thing I forgot to ship to Montem


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was also looking at ES


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I'd need EEP :(


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and that needs the old sciency boys


[09-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And the galaxy doesn't need that much GIN


[09-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm wondering why WIN is easier than GIN


[09-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or


[09-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	some of this stuff doesn't make sense


[09-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or how I became a consumables supplier..


[09-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The Moria Limestone Company was created with one product in mind


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	probably because you needed to make the stuff for yourself


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ship Engines


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	yeah


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and then people like me are like "oh CI has that shit"


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and you just make money off of it


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	lol


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	"The Moria Limestone Company" >> Ships


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a lot of my current production was to secure things that would break my production


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like my H/AR GG colony


[09-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I kind of wish my name was a bit more generic


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's why I went with the ambiguous "Fuyutsuki Functional Congl."


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	like one of those Japanese companies that seems to make a bit of everything


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can do anything


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	like that


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	what do they sell? can't tell based on the name


[09-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	We sell Functionality


[09-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	But I decided the second best was a name that would become hilariously obsolete within a few months


[09-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but also recall the company's roots


[09-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I know that when the next reset happens I'm going to name my company Fuyutsuki Universal


[09-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So I can get the company code [FU]


[09-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My original products were LST and FLX


[09-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'm going to keep mine the same so I can be WangDang Industries, a subsidiary of WangDang Heavy Industries


[09-Dec-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delivererofdeath**:	HEAR YE HEAR YE!  ALL SINNERS REPENT!  THE GREAT AND ALMIGHTY MOLP HAS PUNISHED US FOR OUR HUBRIS BY STRIKING DOWN THIS VILE PLANET WHICH HATH VOTED FOR PIOS FOR MANY YEARS NOW!  CHANGE YOUR WICKED WAYS AND COME TO THE LIGHT OF CONS!

**Rubicate**:	No way, let's continue to defy the heavens


[09-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	defy the heavens you say? you mean like a chemistry bonus on a construction planet?


[09-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	No don't say that! You'll doom us all!


[09-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Yes, vote Chemistry, I know you want to join us Rubi


[09-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	do eet


[09-Dec-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You know you love that sound of seeing "X units of Nutrient Solution have been produced at your base at Moria-Montem."


[09-Dec-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	More like "X Units of Nutrient Solution have been produced at your base at Hydration-Timeout a0kasdasdoiasoj2ojoiamsoiamsdoizcx8x"


[09-Dec-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	I vote defiance - JUICE my pios forever

**Dirk_Diggler**:	would love to buy some feo on lm is anyone can post an ad


[09-Dec-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	can our base or warehouse storage be expanded on montem?


[09-Dec-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	without building the 5k storage under buildings?


[09-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KorGgenT**:	you cn either build a STO or rent a WAR


[09-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	yeah i rented a WAR and don't want to use space for a STO


[09-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	i just saw an expansion option in Montem Warehouse


[09-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	didn't know if that would apply to our base or planet warehouse

**TwinGs**:	or if it's something different


[09-Dec-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KorGgenT**:	that's expanding the planet one i think


[09-Dec-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	like it's a contribution to the planet warehouse system?


[09-Dec-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KorGgenT**:	that's what i suspect


[09-Dec-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	ok


[09-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	expanding the planet WAR would eventually unlock the ability for companies to rent multiples, essentially increasing the space you can have with it


[09-Dec-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but you'd have to pay for each unit


[09-Dec-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	Looks like the Montem WAR is already lvl 3, so each company can already rent two 500t/500m units while there are available WAR units left.

**MadMonk21**:	easiest if you can pick it up on YI right now


[14-Dec-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or I should have some arriving to the CX today or tomorrow


[14-Dec-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah for me its a cost:benefit analysis of just buying the NS locally or producing it myself, so thats a hard sell


[14-Dec-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	In that case I will not be a huge asshole


[14-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	lol yeah if possible we'd post them as buys


[14-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I mainly use the "threat of piracy" because new players show up and I want to teach them good practices.


[14-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and until private contracts exist, there is a smart way and a "not smart way"


[14-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah I really want private contracts


[14-Dec-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and recurring contracts too


[14-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	recurring would be really nice


[14-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but honestly, what I _really_ want to see is "Terms"


[14-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	things like NET30, NET20, etc


[14-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if you know about them, you know.


[14-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	oh yeah, those would be nice too


[14-Dec-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because there are some contracts I would want to set up that are like NET15 + 7.5% penalty for NET30, considered in default @ T+31


[14-Dec-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and _collateral_


[14-Dec-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The other things I really want to see are things like dividends for corps


[14-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah it would be great for them to pour some more content into the contracts and stuff


[14-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	Hey wait a sec, I was thinking about expanding to Verdant... What's wrong with it?


[17-Dec-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Nothing's wrong with Verdant. GTU just doesn't like an ADM run by SNF


[17-Dec-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	An ADM was built there is a governor and tax now. It's days as a damp offshore tax haven are over


[17-Dec-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Dank offshore tax haven ^^


[17-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	OK, please stop with the "GTU" doesnt like...I didnt like...it is a me thing, not a GTU thing


[17-Dec-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	@Alka there were reasons that had noting to do with the ADM or Taxes that caused me to rethink and remove my base from Verdant.  It is a great planet, with great players, please do not think twice about moving there


[17-Dec-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Yea awesome for farming, O and water. I started here and Verdant was my 2nd base. It works well.


[17-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	@SNF do you guys think maybe you can break out the coloring books and explain things to Xeno so he can stop trying to bait and troll....the issue is dead and over


[17-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah it's not a GTU thing


[17-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I mean it was only GTU that have complained about the ADM, all other parties wanted one


[17-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I don't think that is the case at all


[17-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	(sigh)


[17-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	It was not the GTU...it was 2 members that happened to be in the GTU, but our reasons were not GTU related, they were personal.....


[17-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	3 members*


[17-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	who was the 3rd


[17-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	isn't having a planet without an ADM just a waste of money? like, some default production taxes will be levied without the ADM, but all the money collected is just gone forever without an ADM to spend it, right?


[17-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I guess 4, Ganksta, Kerfy, Xk(He came around to being ok with it), Kiriaster also had some issues


[17-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Kiri brought up facts from other planets...she didnt hav an issue


[17-Dec-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parafort**:	@Alka you are thinking of a ADM without a govenor


[17-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	not really facts since they were wrong in the first place but yea


[17-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Verdant was tax free


[17-Dec-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	well, i got information showing otherwise, but ok


[17-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	anyway, I am not getting into this again....enjoy


[17-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Oh sorry, I didn't realize this wasn't Verdant chat. My bad, didn't want to intentionally spread it to other planets... not trolling, promise.


[17-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parafort**:	i get it. seeing the same names everywhere you go.


[17-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Alka, Verdant is a really good place to expand to, lots of water, very fertile


[17-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	there have been some worker shortage problems there, which is a big reason the ADM is being built, to have a governor that can have an organized way of fixing that


[17-Dec-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I can highly recommend settling out there and think that the ADM will help make it an even better place for expansion


[17-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I actually agree with @monk  On a side note I am 2 days away from being able to clear the CX of all the carbon orders


[17-Dec-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	Dang, that's 3 ship loads of just C!


[17-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	and don't worry, I don't need to sold on expanding to Verdant, its resources speak for themselves :)


[17-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alka**:	Plus as a fresh base, I would get the first pick of all the new PIO untill I started catching up with the big players on Verdant anyway, and in a few weeks they'll probably have the PIO shortage taken care of like Montem did.


[17-Dec-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah I think there are already plans in motion to rectify that


[17-Dec-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	@Alka Big players on Verdant? SMH,,, Just because we have an abundance of rations doesn't mean we get fat.


[17-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Some of us just have a hormonal imbalance... it's got nothing to do with eating cheeseburgers at 3am


[17-Dec-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@McGangsta They bought the big thing I sell: BER


[17-Dec-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	aw, yes. BER


[17-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	is it the one who has like 200 of it listed on the CX now?


[17-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep, same guy


[17-Dec-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	we're talking about it in Global


[17-Dec-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Very


[17-Dec-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Oh... I thought I bought the BER en masse


[17-Dec-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you bought _one_ of the ships


[17-Dec-21 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, and now I still have a pile of BER since I had to ship other things to Circe as well

[22-Dec-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well now that CMs are deconstruct-able


[22-Dec-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	there seems to have been a purge in the game, maybe having to do with moving towards steam integration, lots of old accounts removed

**KenFair**:	I'm looking for some advice on the next step to take. I've been on PrUn for about two months now. My company is now turning a profit, albeit a small one. I'm trying to decide the next thing to expand into and am curious what others think.


[25-Dec-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	what're you doing now


[25-Dec-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and is your base full/


[25-Dec-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there is no "right answer"


[25-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you can kind of do whatever you want


[25-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	My base on Montem has BMPx2, EXTx2, PP1, and REF


[25-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would focus on just two or three industries per planet


[25-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	rather than 4, 5, 6, 7


[25-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and fill out hte planet to 500\500 area


[25-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	I'm trying to decide whether to go vertical integration: add SME and COL to make FE, then continue using that with my pp1


[25-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I ended up with three pp1's and one pp2's


[25-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	with smelters to support them


[25-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and a WEL


[25-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Or go wide: add more BMPs and PP1s and produce more of the same.


[25-Dec-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Or go tall and move to PP2.


[25-Dec-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	BMP's become difficult to sustain at a point I found when starting out


[25-Dec-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vertical integration for making fabs isn't a bad idea


[25-Dec-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but just focus on 3 industries


[25-Dec-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	SME and that's it, I wouldn't have the REF


[25-Dec-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and then just keep adding duplicate buildings until the base is maxed out


[25-Dec-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	then settle another planet


[25-Dec-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Right. That's what I'm doing (the REF is just to make me some fuel at low cost).


[25-Dec-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I focus on one primary and one secondary industry per planet


[25-Dec-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vallis is bfabs and only bfabs


[25-Dec-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	promitor is DW\RAT\COF


[25-Dec-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Makes sense.


[25-Dec-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Simplifying the inputs is a good idea.


[25-Dec-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	I can get Montem to the point where I'm only really buying C, fuel components, and some consumables (DW/RAT/COF, mainly).


[25-Dec-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	Thanks for the advice.

**Talmar**:	@KenFair Most people try to stick to 1 industry per planet, to take advantage of the Experts. Most of my planets are like that. Except my base here, which is a horror show.


[26-Dec-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I find in my plans that each planet is pretty unique in one industry, with maybe one small supporting industry (usually extraction)


[26-Dec-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but montem? that's the "rounding error fix" planet which is also going to be a mess


[26-Dec-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Dec-21 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Xenogenic**:	Wow this Steam launch is really bolstering the economy


[28-Dec-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**parafort**:	apparently it had started a little earlier. but it wasn't visible here becouse the planet was full.


[28-Dec-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah I think Harmonia got bum rushed sometime last week


[28-Dec-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But I take the missing BSE as the largest indicator that something is up


[28-Dec-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the steam launch is a soft launch


[28-Dec-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes it's on the store but there are no direct links


[28-Dec-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it just says "coming soon™"


[28-Dec-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it indicates april 2022 - wonder if exiting early access will happen that quickly with a corresponding universe reset


[28-Dec-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I dunno


[28-Dec-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I only caught half the live stream but steam does not come with a uni reset.


[28-Dec-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That seems like a bad idea


[28-Dec-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean getting a bunch of people to join in an old universe


[28-Dec-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I like the idea of the Steam launch


[28-Dec-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but I think that's the extent of what I like about it: the idea


[28-Dec-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	there's going to be a lot of player volatility as people get in, and then out, of the game rapidly


[28-Dec-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	smells like bfabs and consumables will swing rapidly


[28-Dec-21 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well, they _can_


[28-Dec-21 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it doesn't mean they _will_


[28-Dec-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the thing that truly worries me is that greater exposure leads to more people doing sus shit.


[28-Dec-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and Steam accounts are free which means it's trivial to bot the game


[28-Dec-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and TBQH, if the game's integrity ends up being undermined then I will just stop playing


[28-Dec-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I don't really want to just stop; however, I'm not going to participate with what amounts to straight up cheating. I stopped playing Apex Legends when the hacks surfaced and I realized that Warzone was full of hackers day 7 and quit that too


[28-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm too old to deal with that flavor of bullshit


[28-Dec-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there's a reason why I have thousands of hours, each, in factorio satisfactory and dyson sphere program


[28-Dec-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	also, steam doesn't introduce anything new to cheating and creating new accounts


[28-Dec-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	all you need is an email to make an acct through the website


[28-Dec-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	not difficult either


[28-Dec-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think that the exposure factor on Steam is somewhat larger


[28-Dec-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's kind of like security through obscurity


[28-Dec-21 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah simply by raising the exposure you will get more people fucking around in a nominal sense


[28-Dec-21 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they will need mechanisms to prevent people from fucking with the economy with new accounts though

[29-Dec-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	nah, AML


[29-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well yes, but _why_


[29-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I understand that


[29-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You and I are on "Team Weird Shit"


[29-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=)


[29-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and after selling nearly 10k FF I finally have the money to buy the AMLs


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, eventually I want to get into the spaceship part manufacturing business


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	with chem as a side gig


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	BER can singlehandedly make THPs


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yup


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yup


[29-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	only issue is that the ratio of AL:SI isn't even


[29-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	were you planning on intentional SME downtime for the CF?


[29-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or import AL?


[29-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I've got a guy for AL


[29-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	he does metallurgy stuff. I tore all mine down


[29-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's fair.


[29-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You and I were thinking the same thing


[29-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just haven't pulled the trigger on it yet for two reasons:


[29-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	afabs are expensive as fuck


[29-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	1) THP -> THS is kind of niche. I'm having some doubts about just how in-demand this stuff is.


[29-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	2) I'm not sure if I want to build the AML here on Montem or on Circe. The more I have thought about it, the more Montem seems to be the correct choice.


[29-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	Montem is nice for the centralization and ease of access to your BER supply


[29-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but Circe is really fantastic with that CoGC bonus for chem


[29-Dec-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It is... but Circe has the Chem COGC


[29-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and when you're looking at a building like the AML, maximizing those consumables and Capex starts to matter a lot more


[29-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	though every day we get slightly closer to flipping that CoGC here


[29-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Even if we did, I don't know if that's the right thing to do


[29-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well the thing about the consumables is that Circe has QQ-001a right next door, a manufacturing CoGC


[29-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	In the future I want to through down the high tech manufacturing buildings there


[29-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yes, but the AML consumables are... not the easiest


[29-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	LOOKING AT YOU FIM


[29-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, again, I got people who live on Verdant, and I sell them DDT for cheap


[29-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it's ridiculous how much you need, and how little is made per run


[29-Dec-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep


[29-Dec-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm sitting here looking at HER math and just hating existence


[29-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I feel ya man. That's why I let other people deal with it


[29-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I suppose I could make a HER base on Verdant and make nothing but that


[29-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I wonder how many FRM you can fit into 500 area


[29-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or maybe do a "just FIM" base


[29-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that would be pretty good, HER takes barely any water


[29-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'm pretty sure 1 RIG on Verdant could fuel a full base of FRMs making only HER


[29-Dec-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	1 Rig supports roughly 9 ish FRMS


[29-Dec-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	making HER's


[29-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	depending on expert setup this number may be different


[29-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yeah, but it's a good starting point


[29-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	base time on HER is 1 per 12 hours


[29-Dec-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yeah i have 163% efficiency so HER is just 1 day


[29-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so that's 36 HER per day with your efficiency


[29-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	(also Jealous.)


[29-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can run 18 FPs full time making nothing but FIM


[29-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	you can fit in 13 FRM into 500 area, and getting H2O off the Verdant LM shouldn't be a problem


[29-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	then you're just limited by your DDT consumption


[29-Dec-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and you'd have to have a large and stable supply


[29-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	but is there such a demand for FIM atm


[29-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I don't think there is, but HER does more than just FIM


[29-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it goes into KOM + MED as well


[29-Dec-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	72 FIM per day on Verdant would feed ~ 700 ENGs assuming that everyone only had 100 and you didn't have to worry about fractional consumption


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that sounds like overkill xD


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it sounds like overkill _for now_


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	true


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	sounds like overkill? dewit!


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I mean, if you want to talk about overkill


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have 10 EXTs on YI-280j


[29-Dec-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	overkilling things is the best way of doing things


[29-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Ten.


[29-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I am legitimately producing more than the universe can use


[29-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_by a lot_


[29-Dec-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Look at the supply numbers on BER at NC1


[29-Dec-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm about to handle the MGS shortage as well as I can produce 320 MGS in a day


[29-Dec-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just can't move it all


[29-Dec-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	once this ship gets home carrying 500H to Montem, it will immediately turn to YI-280j and get MGS to bring back to MOR


[29-Dec-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	New guy here, played a couple years ago, forgot everything. Other than the new core planet what big changes?


[29-Dec-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	CXs aren't on planets any more


[29-Dec-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	NAV Modules 1 + 2 got nerfed super hard


[29-Dec-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	yeh I saw their a station now


[29-Dec-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Uh, there's a new recipe for SF


[29-Dec-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the new starter ships are stupidly powerful


[29-Dec-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Forgot recipes anyway, pay no money so my only shipping will be my own.


[29-Dec-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	In that case, you'll want to look into input balanced bases and expand in clusters


[29-Dec-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	as you can build "glass ships" that are only useful for travel inside of a system (no FTL engine)


[29-Dec-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	new ships is cool, I can put around this system then for awhile. Food and and basic modules for awhile.


[29-Dec-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So this is more "meta" knowledge


[29-Dec-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Montem still top dog, prom close second?


[29-Dec-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but the largest fuel producer in the game quit like 2 weeks ago


[29-Dec-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you haven't invested a lot of time into this universe, I would highly recommend picking up fuel


[29-Dec-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Believe it or not, Deimos/Nike as a pair were a strong second. The issue was always that Antares didn't have good exports for the rest of the universe until they started magically exporting SC.


[29-Dec-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and Carbon was cheap there, so it came to Moria and became BFAB central


[29-Dec-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Lets see, what else... UTS.NC1 has a MM now and it prints money in a horizontal base that's dedicated to producing FE -> UTS


[29-Dec-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I'm in no hurry, I can spend a month just getting this first base built. Might sell some fuel if there's a price bubble


[29-Dec-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh there is definitely a price bubble


[29-Dec-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	FF.NC1


[29-Dec-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	So how does this station market work, I tried to buy a little FE, then my order was cancelled and refunded


[29-Dec-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	What price did you try and buy it at?


[29-Dec-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I payed the ask, not gonna quibble over $33


[29-Dec-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Hmm, are you sure it was canceled and refunded?


[29-Dec-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The CXs should work _exactly_ like they used to, with the one proviso that _if you want to buy or sell goods at the CX, you either need a ship docked there, or a Warehouse unit rented_


[29-Dec-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if you bought goods and there wasn't a ship there, and you don't have a warehouse unit, the goods are put into a "holding contract" by the game

[29-Dec-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Build an extractor, buy my FE, at least supply my own needs.


[29-Dec-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That could also work


[29-Dec-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Looks like the Colony ship won't be big enough to really start


[29-Dec-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ok, hard choices were made


[29-Dec-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	So without paying money I can't even buy or sell on local markets. Only place I'll ever be able to trade is a station. Just about a game killer for me.


[29-Dec-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You can play the game without PRO


[29-Dec-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Not being able to do LM transactions does put a cramp on the game for sure, but it's not a deal breaker unless you're going after niche things


[29-Dec-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think the bigger issue with a lack of LM access is that you can't do things on Margin, you have to have the cash _right then and there_ to function at the CX.


[29-Dec-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so it changes how you would play

[29-Dec-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I remember they used to be thrilled when some PC or someone mentioned them and new people showed up. 99% left because it's a hard start. I bet they don;t get many new players now.


[29-Dec-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	At $20 each, that production is less than $200 a day, that's break even money.


[31-Dec-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's less than BE because you have to account for the depreciation of the buildings and paying the workers


[31-Dec-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	No wonder ore is so much cheaper than FE, you gotta buy your C or the water to grow it.

[01-Jan-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jan-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	2


[01-Jan-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if you are generous and count promitor


[01-Jan-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	There are at least a dozen planets that are better at farming than Montem


[01-Jan-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Prom has the 2nd highest fertility, only beat our by Saladin, and it's a tiny amount of difference


[01-Jan-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	with more fertility there are only (nearby) Proxion Verdant and Promitor


[01-Jan-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jan-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jan-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jan-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	Though


[04-Jan-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would caution you that your repair bill looks suspiciously like you're repairing early


[04-Jan-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If it hasn't been at least ~ 80 days since your last repair or the building was built, you are probably wasting resources.


[04-Jan-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zorgalorg**:	do you need about 50 iron ore or 15-18 units of iron?


[04-Jan-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	most buildings should not be repaired until either 90 or 121 days


[04-Jan-22 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**StarBase_1nc**:	Are you guys seeing these RAT.NC1 prices?


[09-Jan-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Yep, RAT and DW.NC1 are a problem in Moria. Too few food producers.


[09-Jan-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StarBase_1nc**:	Oof


[09-Jan-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	You might want to settle Verdant or Prom to produce them for yourself and sell excess on CX. There is always a huge demand here.


[09-Jan-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StarBase_1nc**:	I'll try that once i have the resources.


[09-Jan-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Verdant also has a very good O resource if you do any smelting.


[09-Jan-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StarBase_1nc**:	Actually, I mostly make prefabs.


[09-Jan-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Me too. But I make my own FE, so I ship my O from Verdant. O prices are fluctuating wildly on CX.


[09-Jan-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	Remember everyone, if you need FF, throw up some buys on the CX, fuel truck arrives in 19 hours


[09-Jan-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I have a lot of it, and I'll sell it for cheap


[09-Jan-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StarBase_1nc**:	That'd be nice.


[09-Jan-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	oh, on the CX, sad


[09-Jan-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, I'm not trying to fly to any planets with the ship. It's a really long flight from the source, so I try to minimize SF used so I can sell that too


[09-Jan-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	makes sense, should be easy to fill the demans


[09-Jan-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	FF shortage is still real


[09-Jan-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's why I'm shipping it all the way from the OH region (specifically TD-228b, or as I like to call it, Turbo)

However, I've scaled it back from 45 to 35, as opposed to the orginal 30, because our upkeep costs has increased since last month when we voted on the temporary tax increase. Thank you for helping Montem keep it's workforce healthy.

[17-Jan-22 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-22 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-22 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mostly use them myself


[17-Jan-22 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-22 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which at 500 or so per AL is pretty profitable


[17-Jan-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	more like 0.04 SCI


[18-Jan-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so would that mean we have that percent chance of getting 1 SCI?


[18-Jan-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	no, just that we're on our way to getting 1 eventually.


[18-Jan-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	it's cumulative then?


[18-Jan-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	It's a zero percent chance of getting a SCI here without an EDU building, so those 40 open jobs are a complete waste of money and time


[18-Jan-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	So does Gov decide what to build or is it simply chosen by contributions.


[18-Jan-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	both


[18-Jan-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think most of the time the Governor uses tax funds to build the infrastructure, often with input from the citizens as to what to build. Some of them do polls or stuff like that to see what people want


[18-Jan-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but there's nothing stopping individuals from contributing to infrastructure or building them outright themselves if they want


[18-Jan-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	how much do you need?


[19-Jan-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	2 W would be plenty


[19-Jan-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, I can do that. It will be rather expensive though


[19-Jan-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and a while before I can get the BTS


[19-Jan-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	what are we talking for "expensive" and "awhile" lol?


[19-Jan-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	probably about 15k/u on the W (afabs man...) and I just sent fuyustuki a message about acquiring BTS. if you find someone else that can get it faster/cheaper, I won't be offended


[19-Jan-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	best case scenario is a week, but I would guess probably 2


[19-Jan-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	People of Montem! A new and upgraded tax system is soon arriving to this game. It will allow us to tax different type of workers (pioneers, settlers, etc) differently. The natural first thought to this is to tax higher level workers a higher rate, as their infrastructure buildings and upkeep costs a lot more.


[25-Jan-22 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	However, the higher level workers are so outnumbered by the lower tier workers that even with a very high tax rate they will still not be able to provide a genuine dent in the tax income we take in. Pioneers outnumber Technicians about 35:1, yet the highest I can increase technician tax rate is x3 of what we have today.


[25-Jan-22 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Any public opinion or comments on the situation?


[25-Jan-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Currently I'm paying 14ncc tax to make a RBH, I've no concerns about this been cranked up a bit.

[25-Jan-22 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	tax the rich


[25-Jan-22 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Hahahaha…this is so true to life. Even if it doesn’t make a big difference due to vastly different volumes, higher level should be taxed somewhat higher for many reasons.


[25-Jan-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Lower taxes, minimum taxes is easily enough to comfortably support the necessary POPI, anyone wanting sudden expansion of high tiers can always invest themselves


[25-Jan-22 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Bobemor, at the minimum taxes we'd barely be able to pay for the CoGC, we'd have almost nothing left over for Popi


[25-Jan-22 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Plus, our 10 Safety Stations contribued 59% of Safety, without it's rather expensive upkeep we'd see a steady loss of Pioneers, Settlers and Technicans


[25-Jan-22 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I'm very much in favor of low taxes myself, but at this point it's more like anarchy-mode than anything else


[25-Jan-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Low taxes across the board, why make growth fight a headwind. High tier benefits should be paid for by those who benefit. A little more largesse by companies is better.


[25-Jan-22 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiriaster**:	@Rubicate - First, I trust you, do what you think is best.  I understand that (barring vast increases in SET/TEC population) we can't make the TECs pay for all the TEC infrastructure... that's cool.  Based solely on the limited information in this chat window... increase SET taxes to like x1.5, TEC to like x2, and lower PIO a tiny bit if you can.

**Bobemor**:	Hmm, maybe I'm less aware how extortionate local rates for rat and dw are for COGC upkeep around here, but this shocks me to be honest. I will have to inform myself better.


[25-Jan-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Montem probably has a lot more underused bases than I'm used to as well could be causing it.


[25-Jan-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Being a popular starter planet. I guess we have mostly small bases with low level population and production. And a large percentage of abandoned sites. I don't know if they self delete over time, or require periodic purges.


[25-Jan-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think after so many days inactive the accounts liquidate and are removed, but I'm not sure what that threshold is


[25-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	They self delete after certain thresholds, but yeah may well have more barely full bases than some other planets. But high pio population is usually quite good for taxes. Don't have the FPs though which are basically just tax printing machines

**Fuyutsuki**:	I have made a donation of 2K water to the SSTs


[25-Jan-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I am in favor of a few things:


[25-Jan-22 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Production fees need to come up to 60 across the board. Warehouse can move to 375


[25-Jan-22 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Then the tax structure makes more sense if treated as a multiple


[25-Jan-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	SET 1.4x, Tech: 2.0x, ENG: 2.6x, SCI: 3.0x


[25-Jan-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	gotta take the kids to school


[25-Jan-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Our production fees are already higher than most. We have a robust LM, a fee increase there would generate some extra funds.

[25-Jan-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I suspect the newbie/inactive accounts being regular on Montem is indeed to blame. We are a very popular starting planet, and each new player buys consumables on Moria, increases the CoGC price, but contributes very little in taxes.


[25-Jan-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Fuyutsuki, is it fair to increase Settler taxes? AFAIK they are almost no popi cost, and the CoGC vote we keep having is +10% to pioneer and nothing for settlers.


[25-Jan-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Should settlers then be made to pay more than Pioneers? What exactly are they paying for?


[25-Jan-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think it's fair to say PIO pays more than SET, or at least not less than the SET


[25-Jan-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	@Bobemor some quick napkin math tells me CoGC costs about 165k/10days, while a tax level of 10 would pull in about 190k/week. There is some extra, but it's very thin for all the popi upkeeps.


[25-Jan-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	While we aren't aggressively gunning for an university, I do want to utilize the great buildings we already have to maintain a healthy popi growth before we run out rather than after


[25-Jan-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I'm confused, we have several kinds of fees, production, marketing, rental... But I've never seen mention a TAX. I can't find any tax expenses in my financial tabs. What is a tax level of 10?


[25-Jan-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	OK found Developers Blog, confusion abated


[25-Jan-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah tax if the production fees


[25-Jan-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I think I would set them with the same gradient as the influence factor in voting


[25-Jan-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
***BlueXIX** left.*


[25-Jan-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I currently pay about 2K/week in production fees, more of a nuisance than anything else. Surprised to see warehouse occupancy near 50%, doubling that fee would add 15K to the planet coffers.


[25-Jan-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@Rubicate I'm looking at settlers as the primary workforce of both the FS and POL, both of which are fairly lucrative buildings.


[25-Jan-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's less about "what is fair" and more about "what is sustainable?" I would rather give up a portion of my profits to _help_ as that's what the heavy Tax on upper industry does, it helps with the PIO issue. Right now the scale is _so heavily weighted_ for PIOs that it's not great in terms of trying to seek balance


[25-Jan-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I guess tax income is north of 700k/week. warehouse and market fees are only a few percent of that total. If more money is needed it'll have to come from that production fee.


[25-Jan-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Without seeing the full financials it's hard to make a super-informed opinion


[25-Jan-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Napkin math,


[25-Jan-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	vallis government posts a pretty good audit of income and expenses


[25-Jan-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	obviously not everything is the same - but it's a pretty similar planet to get ideas in the rough ballpark


[25-Jan-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Does the governors office get stats like "Number of ads posted for 1 day, 2 days, 3..."?


[25-Jan-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	no


[25-Jan-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would imagine that's a non-trivial sum of income


[25-Jan-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	See, that's what I would want because there's not a linear correlation with ad duration


[25-Jan-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it means that you can make a guess on how many ads are posted, but you'll never be spot on


[25-Jan-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	all we see is the money that goes into our corp, thats it


[25-Jan-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'd be comfortable saying it's 20-40 per day; because there are pre-arranged trades that get sniped instantly so they're easy to miss


[25-Jan-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so 12-24k per 10 day period


[25-Jan-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I feel like it almost has to be more than that


[25-Jan-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Even on a naïeve linear estimate


[25-Jan-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that's 159.949404761904762 ads per day


[25-Jan-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I figure that over the course of a year, the decimals are probably safe to discard due to canceled ads


[25-Jan-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I just called it 50 a day at 50 each=25 a day, rounded down to 15K a week, same as the warehouse pays. Gov said at 10 tax we get 190K a week, so at our current 35 it's just shy of 700k.


[25-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Naive linear says LM brings in ~ 84k every 10 days


[25-Jan-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Personally, I think we could easily go to 60/25 on the LM ads and add ~ 48k every 10 days to the planet's budget. That gets us up to 102k just from the LM with naïve numbers.


[25-Jan-22 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and it also capitalizes a little more on the multi-day postings


[25-Jan-22 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	not to mention that LM fees are basically _targeted at Pro players_ and I'm fine with that


[25-Jan-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if taxes need to be raised again, before the taxation update


[25-Jan-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that would be a more equitable way of doing it, I agree


[25-Jan-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	is there anyway we can cut down on upkeep costs? @Rubicate are most of the items purchased off the CX?


[25-Jan-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I know RAT and DW probably aren't really produced here, but other stuff probably is


[25-Jan-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	There has been suggestions to move to an auction system, and I'm open to this, but the devs keep teasing that a new governance system is just around the corner so I've been kinda putting it off until then to see what the landscape will be like


[25-Jan-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	The auction on UFO Discord gives us some real good options


[25-Jan-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but the issue with that is engagement.


[25-Jan-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Unlike Valis where a majority of the population is SNF and thus plugged into their discord, we don't have any real unity here on Montem


[25-Jan-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah, I'm real worried that auctions end up becoming a pro elitist thing, where a select few big players take the governmental cake every week


[25-Jan-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	by buying from the CX I at least ensure that regular montem players get a chance to sell their outputs just as much as everybody else


[25-Jan-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	CX is liable to get hit (like I just did) and there's no guarantee that the DW comes from Moria


[25-Jan-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	we pulled in 696k last cycle, so Delcat's guess was very accurate


[25-Jan-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I mean, if there are people that can do the volume required on Montem, that's great... but our planet kind of sucks for DW


[25-Jan-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If anything, I would expect DW to come from Etherwind or Verdant


[25-Jan-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	If the price difference is too big to stomach I source it from elsewhere than Moria


[25-Jan-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	LMA YI-715b/12159


[25-Jan-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-22 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and, for something as critical as POPI? honestly? It should be open to accounts older than 60 days, but not locked behind PRO


[26-Jan-22 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think that opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities


[26-Jan-22 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-22 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	@rubicate truthfully I would suggest the practical compromise between a full auction system and the expensive CX buying: bulk buying directly from suppliers as much as possible. You'll also find players quite enjoy supplying planetary upkeeps


[26-Jan-22 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	^^


[26-Jan-22 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	FIOC is currently eyeing Verdant and MCG production in the NEO region. These will be a fair way out, however, sadly. But I would bet that some of these large corps around already have these setup and have some cheap supplies to buy directly

[29-Jan-22 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I assumed CONS with Vallis as META, (it worked very well last universe), but it is interesting seeing CHEM highest


[29-Jan-22 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	assume people just pumping FLX and NS?


[29-Jan-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i would like construction, but then again my base is gonna be empty for the next 2 weeks while i change my plans


[29-Jan-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I'm the only construction voter, and insignificant vote value


[29-Jan-22 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	well, construction doesnt really benefit all players so...yea


[29-Jan-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I normally vote settler. Mostly big boys voting chemi, doubt it's for flx and ns


[29-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	pioneer not settler


[29-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	gotta ask the rest tho, how many people would benefit with chemistry vs construction cogc... any possibility we can work out a rotation of specialisations instead of sticking to pio?


[29-Jan-22 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	In my view construction would be the most obvious vote for anyone without a CONS base and for anyone wanting to maximise their output across multiple NEO bases


[29-Jan-22 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	most population is pioneer by a big margin, but if you figure value of production who knows. I suspect a lot of manufacturing going on too.


[29-Jan-22 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Like Metallurgy on Vallis presumably was voted for by people RES bases and those wanting to optimise to maximise production. A Metallurgy seller on Vallis won't have been to fussed about the COGC


[29-Jan-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hmm... so no chance for a rotation between specialisations?


[29-Jan-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	FEO strong on Vallis, we are a huge close market for the FE. Plus the station market


[29-Jan-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(In case its not obvious, RES bases on Vallis have recently had their production decreased but inputs stay the exact same, so slightly price increase and they'd be uneffected. But they've then had a HUGE demand increase which will vastly increase their profit margins. Vallis SMEs will have had their input prices vastly increase in cost, but then their output has increased substantially so they're about equal)


[29-Jan-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Rotations between specialisations sound nice in theory but always go absolutely terribly. Specialisation increases production hugely, but requires stability


[29-Jan-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	ah... ic


[29-Jan-22 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	so we really gonna stick with pio?


[29-Jan-22 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I won't be voting for PIO, but I don't know the politics of the region well enough to know if CHEM or CONS is best. Depends if Vallis SMEs want to get a better price for their outputs, or cheaper inputs.


[29-Jan-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'd have thought cheaper FLX isn't going to make much price difference, cheaper NS is going to dilluted, then more expensive LST wouldn't be good for them. So I'd assume CONS would be better as it would just increase their output demand


[29-Jan-22 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	FEO is dirt cheap, but FE is no bargain, high C prices have kinda squeezed the whole chain


[29-Jan-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I just returned from a trip to HRT to buy C, saved 100ncc per unit, paid for the trip plus profit with some RAT and H2O paid for


[29-Jan-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'm surprised FEO is dirt cheap with a META COGC, but C does make sense


[29-Jan-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ultimately you should be aiming to import GRN not C though, especially if going all way to HRT

**Delcat**:	I really don't wanna use limited space for INCs, Trying to keep production simple and direct


[29-Jan-22 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Hadn't really looked at that, INC's are tiny, not a bad option. hmmm...


[29-Jan-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	GRN ships a lot better than C (500 vs 222) You're basically getting double the C for the same shipment.


[29-Jan-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Serious GRN farmers on Verdant I assume have loads of INCs on Vallis


[29-Jan-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I make GRN on Verdant and burn it to C on Prism


[29-Jan-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Prism is pretty close to Montem/Vallis, and has a 25% CoGC bonus. I recommend it.


[29-Jan-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Yeh, I was thinking I'd waste 100 space on 3 INC's but 2 will cover my needs. Didn't really like 3 day trip to buy C every 2 weeks..


[29-Jan-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Prism for the COGC bonus is smart, but doesn't quite benefit from the Moria STL ships


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	true


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but I can do the Prism->Vallis trip in 12 ish hours


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	meaning I can go back to Prism overnight for another 12 hours


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it syncs up very well


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if it had just been 16 hours away I'd always be arriving in the middle of the night which would effectively make it a 24h trip


[29-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I can see that working, I hadn't quite considered Prism for INCs, don't think it would quite work for FIOC but i may have to look at it more closely

[29-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	hm, nice


[29-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but what are these DOU and TCU things


[29-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm working on sourcing them


[29-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ooooh, very nice. I'm impressed.


[29-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm also trying to get a full supply of BSC + RED for its opening


[29-Jan-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	since that would last ~ 40 days


[29-Jan-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but as we're already capped out on SSTs and we need safety, this made the most sense


[29-Jan-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	as RFABs for the large center are just... well, they're a lot


[29-Jan-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	true, but our popi needs are pretty well met for a long time forwards as-is I suspect


[29-Jan-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but it's mainly the _consumables_ for the large security post


[29-Jan-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	big POW consumer


[29-Jan-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	CCD + RAD + SUD as consumables is less than fun.


[29-Jan-22 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	heya Gazer


[29-Jan-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	Just starting it out.


[29-Jan-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Welcome onboard, I'm the local Govenor, nice to meet you.


[29-Jan-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	Nice to meet you too.


[29-Jan-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	Victualler here seem hard to start


[29-Jan-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	True, planet isn't well suited for it


[29-Jan-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's not impossible though


[29-Jan-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but if you feel you made a mistake in setting up a victualler base here you can use the COLIQ command to restart elsewhere


[29-Jan-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I know a few people who do farm here though, they like having easy access to a market that's very greedy for their outputs


[29-Jan-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	over at Promitor you'll have an easier time growing stuff but more rivals too


[29-Jan-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	This is my first time I gave this game a time to play.


[29-Jan-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Don't worry too much about being super profitable to start with, IMO the first week or so is entirely about gathering knowledge and understanding of the game


[29-Jan-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's very common to restart once you have the hang of things and can make better decisions


[29-Jan-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	My First login is way back 100 days ago , but not yet acutally played. Last resort on CoLiq perhaps if no more liquid assets


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	true, but COLIQ can be a business decision as well


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	not just game over


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	I supposed buying stl fuel is irrelevant if just starting out?


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	what happen if i got no OVE?


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	You need to fly your products to moria to sell them, this uses up SF fuel


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
***NoChadLee** joined.*


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if you are lacking OVE, or other consumabels, you workers will work a lot slower


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	the time it takes to create products will be longer


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	you generally never wanna run out of OVE, DW or RAT


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	PWO and COF are good but not 100% important


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	so the three should be never run out


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	correct, it's a major loss


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	seem way longer to self produce the OVA for now


[29-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's very hard to make OVE, DW and RAT all by yourself, it's common to buy them at Moria and fly them here


[29-Jan-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	usually people focus on making 1 thing


[29-Jan-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	selling that which they make, and buying what they need


[29-Jan-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	i recently sell 10 DW at the station


[29-Jan-22 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	cool


[29-Jan-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	just 40 H20 in 5 days is too long


[29-Jan-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah, Montem is a very dry planet


[29-Jan-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I recommend against doing water-based industry here


[29-Jan-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	you can kinda get away with growing agriculture and making carbon or rations out of it, but drinking water is very very hard and unprofitable at length


[29-Jan-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's basically a desert planet


[29-Jan-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	Victualler starting package is the RIG


[29-Jan-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	you are right about that. But Prosperous Universe is the sorta game where you need to learn to be savvy and smart, you can't just follow directions


[29-Jan-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but again, don't worry, I've messed up way more myself many times haha


[29-Jan-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Part of the game is learning these things, what planets are good for what industries


[29-Jan-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	once you have that knowledge, you can use it to make good decisions that leads to great profits


[29-Jan-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	i wil ljust try this for a while. than using the Coliq.


[29-Jan-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	how old are your buildings? did you build them 100 days ago?


[29-Jan-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	thanks for advice.


[29-Jan-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	Nah i dint make nay pas the tutorial 100 days ago


[29-Jan-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah, okay


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	because then


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	buildings that are new can be destroyed for a refund


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	100% refund within 1 hour


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	then 99% refund for a few days


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	so you can destroy those RIGs and build something else


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	i the right now is 4 days ago


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's no big deal, you will get almost all of them back if you destroy them


[29-Jan-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	making a RIG is 12 BSE, you will get 11 BSE back I think


[29-Jan-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	nah just I will play thrugh until bankrupt


[29-Jan-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	okay, that's fine too


[29-Jan-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	destroying buildings and shifting around your industry is also part of the game though, don't be afraid to experiment


[29-Jan-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gazer022**:	I got the basic idea now thanks to you


[29-Jan-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	While I do put tax money towards higher level popi, Montem in general tries to run on low-taxes low-government, which means we don't make any promises for unlimited engineers. Our neighbouring planet Vallis better for that, as they run roughly double our tax level and invest heavily into engineers and other higher workers.


[01-Feb-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Growing our engineer popi to the open jobs demand would problaby cost more than all other tax expenses combined


[01-Feb-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	While it would be pioneers who ends up playing 95% of that tax income


[01-Feb-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**parafort**:	the new tax options in testing would be great for financing those higher tiers.


[01-Feb-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	indeed, I'm looking forward to the new possibilities


[01-Feb-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I see phobos has set their taxes very low, except for electronics which is astronomical, that is the sector requiring higher tier workers and that is the sector paying for them.


[01-Feb-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	sure Delcat, but triple of zero is still zero


[01-Feb-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	even if I could somehow break the rules and set taxes for electronics ten times the max it will allow me, it still wouldn't pay for the popi buildings used by those electronics industries


[01-Feb-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	there are 183544 pioneers, and 155 engineers


[01-Feb-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I feel like best bet here if people want more higher tier workers is to help fund the buildings


[01-Feb-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-22 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Yeah, thats an idea that makes sense


[01-Feb-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	FuelBoi, I've always run on a low government platform. Increasing all taxes is against my ideals, I don't think small players should pay for veteran player's toys


[01-Feb-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Moved my meager 800 votes to advertise chemistry


[01-Feb-22 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	cool. I feel it would be unfair to overly tax chemistry as long as the CoGC helps primarily pioneers and not settlers


[01-Feb-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Certainly infrastucture benefits should reward the increased taxes, otherwise people would just move. A 25% production boost would justify an increase, then as better infrastructure is developed there could be additional increases if needed to support the new improvements.


[01-Feb-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	agreed


[01-Feb-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paulrik4444**:	I can certainly pitch some materials towards building and supporting infrastructure to help grow engineers. It's only fair that I contribute if m one of the few players on the planet employing engineers


[01-Feb-22 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I agree with that stance. I'm fully funding an EMC for exactly that reason

[01-Feb-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	part of it I think is how much stuff you do on your own


[01-Feb-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	if you're extracting and smelting yourself or have someone who can get it to you for good prices then it can be more profitable

[03-Feb-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Well, if your ship is at the station and you bought the stuff, it should be in ships cargo. If your ship is somewhere else you gotta go pick it up. Check cxos to see if you bought it.


[03-Feb-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

Under Pending Contracts you might see the things you bought from the CX. If you have a ship at the CX Station, you can fullfill those contracts and load your purchases on to your ship

[08-Feb-22 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	12 BSE is about 10,000 NCC. If you put up an extractor, you will pull out at least 200 LST in 10 days. Probably more, once you start getting experts. LST is going for 70/u on the CX, and that's the Bid, not even the Ask. You can easily make the money.


[08-Feb-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Not sure if you have PRO or not, but if you do, put up 12 BSE for 10K, with a 20 day contract, and I'll help you out.

**MadMonk21**:	was it 3k/u for it?

**Fuyutsuki**:	@Shadowsneak @MadMonk21 Sells are posted


[08-Feb-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	@Fuyu I had one up, it already got filled


[08-Feb-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Awkward...


[08-Feb-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah, it was up for like an hour lol


[08-Feb-22 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Sounds like we're starting to have a ton of AMLs on Montem


[08-Feb-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	looks like you are going to get some nice BER buys there Fuyu


[08-Feb-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You'd think so _traitor_


[08-Feb-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=)


[08-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	you didn't say I couldn't not buy from you :)


[08-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You are very correct. I just didn't think you would have a patsy settle the planet


[08-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I didn't, they did that on their own accord


[08-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Honestly though, I'm approaching the limits of my capacity


[08-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so while I'm puffing my chest, it's a good thing economically


[08-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'll still want your BTS though, just in much smaller quantities, and not regularly


[08-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I feel that


[08-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	if I had like, 2 more AMLs I'd probably buy on the regular


[08-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
***T-8** joined.*


[08-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Since I have two AMLs and only one is dedicated to CBM farming, I would rather sell you processed W


[08-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	but I want to make W


[08-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I don't want to buy W


[08-Feb-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	even if the price is super fair (near breakeven)


[08-Feb-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If that's still the case and you'll just have extra AML capacity, I will still sell the BTS


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's a long way off


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm just wanting to present you with all the options so you can wang-dang the one you want


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I still need to get like 3 and a half bases


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	excellent


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	unfortunately it just got real hard to wangdang that ES


[08-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I have my first batch finishing tonight


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's good. I see someone is selling GIN on the LM now


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	aaaaaaaaaaaand I ran out of FIM and there is a single overpriced FIM at the CX


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you want some?


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yes


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yes yes yes


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	please


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	How much do you need?


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can give you 3


[08-Feb-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	tough to say, I don't know when I can get more. let's start with that


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	how much per?


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	FIM.NC1


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Does that look fair?


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	better than 2k


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	we'll call it 1010 then


[08-Feb-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	oh I already threw up for 1020


[08-Feb-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	thankyouilu


[08-Feb-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You're welcome.


[08-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It looks like I may want to establish a FIM production facility on Verdant


[08-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, but you would need an outrageous FP/farm ratio


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I hate the logisitics of FIM and MEA


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	IDK about the ratio


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll be consuming something like 3 FIM / day


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I don't know what it is either, I just know it's stupid


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That will be my next project


[08-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm going to FIMinize Verdant


[08-Feb-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	if 5 experts you can go 1 HER for 2 FPS for FIM


[08-Feb-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	so 1 FRM making HER feeds 2 FPS making FIM


[08-Feb-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	last call on AL, SI, MG


[08-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	and then you would only really need 1 FP on RAT


[08-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	oh my plan would be to either buy or import the RAT


[08-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and max out on HER


[08-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	oh yeah but you can simply buy the rat on verdant


[08-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	depending on your base size i think with a HER base you could literally supply everyone with FIM


[08-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	who needs it


[08-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	ship is departed.


[08-Feb-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I may as well. Now that _some people_ are buying BER from second-hand dealers who don't take worker safety seriously


[08-Feb-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Hey I secured _even more AUO_


[08-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	a real pirate ye be


[08-Feb-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Look at the huge BGC sell I just posted


[08-Feb-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	__yuuuuge__


[08-Feb-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	that's pretty big there


[08-Feb-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You want em?


[08-Feb-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	nope, don't use BGC


[08-Feb-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yet


[08-Feb-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You guys should go to WB-675C got a FI CoGC going, the population is a little low atm tho, but it likely can be fixed with the new Programs getting added in this Patch


[08-Feb-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	FI?


[08-Feb-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Food industries


[08-Feb-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	So with the upcoming update and changes to POPI I'd like some clarity on tax changes from Rubicate, aware its all a bit speculative, but from me its sounding like we really won't need higher taxes and can probably make do with some decreases. couple boosts to engineers maybe could be funded by a very short sharp tax hike on only engineers, but i don't see what Techs or Settlers would gain from higher taxes


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I mean there is a cost for popi


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	per population per unit


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	each is more expensive than the next


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it would be a progressive tax rate


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	25 engineers has a flat cost, spam that a few times be fine


[08-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(take a few weeks sure, but it'll more than double current speed)


[08-Feb-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was thinking of going there to extract HAL


[08-Feb-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though I suppose I could see the appeal of FI


[08-Feb-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm beginning to think I should have named my company the Moria Halite Company


[08-Feb-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	If anyone has 24 spare BDE, that's all that is needed to upgrade the warehouse.


[08-Feb-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Bobemor, I'd like to see the costs of these special popi programs before I declare anything


[08-Feb-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	If they are cheap, we should prob go for em, if they are expensive, maybe not


[08-Feb-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You on PCB discord Rubi? look at PoPI discussion


[08-Feb-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ill check it


[08-Feb-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	PCT*


[08-Feb-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	actually waht is PCB

[08-Feb-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yea, I would read Saganaki's post about the new programs


[08-Feb-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	hmmmm


[08-Feb-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it does seem like it might be rather expensive


[08-Feb-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	does someone have 26 OFF for sale?


[08-Feb-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	starting tomorrow I will be putting out 16 BE per day for the CBM farmers


[09-Feb-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My goal is to develop a third AML and then build a FIM colony on Verdant.


[09-Feb-22 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would make and sell the CBM myself, but that would require running logistics on Lithium and frankly I don't have the time


[09-Feb-22 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm also figuring out how I want to re-tool Montem as a base.


[09-Feb-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	What I'm looking into is whether or not I want to run the electronics chain or develop a long-term contract with someone to buy my SI. The AL I could conceivably throw into a PP2; however, that would depend entirely on the long-term SI buyer. For example, if someone wanted to run a CLR with me acting as the SI + AL supplier, obviously I couldn't then keep the AL.


[09-Feb-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If I do run the electronics chain, what is the desired end product? An ECA doesn't require CLR outputs as input.


[09-Feb-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's a small conundrum.


[09-Feb-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Montem should really spec into something


[09-Feb-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	especially with higher tier pops becoming so available


[09-Feb-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah capacitors are good if you can do the LI also


[09-Feb-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	AL is so expensive here on MON, I think I'm gonna can my PP2, no money in it, I'll just buy my Lfabs


[09-Feb-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah much better if you produce your own AL I'm sure


[09-Feb-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	technically there's 3-4 different electronics chains


[09-Feb-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ECA, software, ELP with MCA for all the things, ELP without MCA but with DRS


[09-Feb-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though those last two are just variations


[09-Feb-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also I'm thinking the main problem with selling BE is that BGC are hard to get


[09-Feb-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	16 BE requires 80 BGC


[09-Feb-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er...


[09-Feb-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or I could make CBS like some sort of peasant


[09-Feb-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and not make a base on Cortez for the sole purpose of making BGC


[09-Feb-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've been doing ECA money printing wrong for weeks :(


[09-Feb-22 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So concerned with making the process BE-efficient that I've let several weeks supply pile up for lack of connectors


[09-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	We need a max weight FTL ship to just fly AUO to Montem in large quantities


[09-Feb-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll go pick some up and bring it in, but I don't have "The Ship"


[09-Feb-22 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Or... someone could start making BGC out of the AUO on Cortez and ship thousands of those


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Then you would have to import Iron


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Still lighter


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Still bad =(


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You only need 1 per 5 BG


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's true


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	import FE + PE


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and at half the weight of the gold


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I mean, I could do it.


[09-Feb-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess you export some AU/BG for other uses


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Faced with my earlier revelation though


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but then someone would need to establish FIM world on Verdant


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'll probably just switch to CBS


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Since I already have hundreds of BCO lying around


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Nothing wrong with making BCS


[09-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	now that BE isn't "sparse"


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This actually makes the hot world next to Verdant more attractive


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's not wildly available yet, but it's definitely easier to come by it


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	CUO 1 jump away from the BER


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	which one?


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	oh, _that one_


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the LIO


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I suppose if you were going to specialize in CBS that's a good choice


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	personally, I think the money curve is more efficient with CBM


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I don't have a CU shortage right now


[09-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	what about CBLs?


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that's AU + CU


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Then you need CU and AU


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	But they're inefficient


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	less than 50% more money for 50% more LI and BE


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Very.


[09-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and more expensive HCCs


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Cortez COGC is Fuel?


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I suppose because of the TS.


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	that makes sense.


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	IDK if I want _another_ low temp base


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No it doesn't :(


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FF is so cheap


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and TS -> FF is already pretty bad


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it does if one person runs the planet (or a very small number of people do)


[09-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	rational decision making is not a universally human trait


[09-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Tell you what, I'll spec the Cortez base


[09-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it's just part of a whole system of useless CoGCs


[09-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Kiruna is running metallurgy


[09-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I will take a look into it when I get home. If I like what I see, I will go settle it

**CapitanIncognito**:	I was planning on doing it


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but _someone_ needs to settle a FIM base


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but in light of current shortages


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm actually more tempted in looking into that FI planet


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you and I are both good candidates for it because we both have bases in YI-280


[09-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so I can offload FP from Verdant and do more farming


[09-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I doubled my KOM production


[09-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh that's nice, there was 0 on the CX a few days ago


[09-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	then I realized that still leaves me with only 7 net production per day


[09-Feb-22 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I had a pretty big deficit


[09-Feb-22 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I can't squeeze in more to Verdant without seriously impacting my FIM plans


[09-Feb-22 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or my existing food production


[09-Feb-22 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The inability to grow HER in HYF is infuriating


[09-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You'd think they'd be one of the most obvious candidates


[09-Feb-22 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	At the very least, I would like the ability to grow HER in ORCs


[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but there really does need to be a building at a higher tier that produces HER better, or there needs to be a path to FIM that uses an alternative to HER like OLF


[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Time to pack up and go home.


[09-Feb-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I wish you could do HER in an HYF


[09-Feb-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have one random farm plopped to make it


[09-Feb-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and even then it doesn't ratio with a FP so I have to buy a few on the market

[09-Feb-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	would take 3 HB1 and 2 HB2


[09-Feb-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm going to start by smelting gold on site


[09-Feb-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and making open jobs with an FS to attract settlers


[09-Feb-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	compared to how expensive they are to get organically, it seems like a rather good deal


[10-Feb-22 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I see we got over 300 more engineers needed with organic growth of 15, so it would be a needed boost. How is it paid for?


[10-Feb-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's just a pure money payment, 80k bucks in, 50 engineers out. It can max be done once per week afaik, but I think it would work out to be a rather minor expense for Montem overall, it's ten, twenty, maybe thirty times cheaper than getting those engineers the "natural" way.


[10-Feb-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	caesarean engineers, why not


[10-Feb-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think the system is very cheaty


[10-Feb-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think people who run engineer bases I'm sure would be willing to pay for it


[10-Feb-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's quite a cheap price relative to those buildings


[10-Feb-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	Hey Montem, your governor here. I've updated our tax rules. Most people will notice no change in their taxing. It's mostly to tax the higher level workers more. I've given a tax break to Extraction of FEO and LST though as I feel too many of Montem's industries are depnedant on that sector being healthy.

[10-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The only thing we are really lacking is engineers, so the strategy going forward is to use the governmental program to give ourselves extra engineers. I'm not sure what's needed past that. I've set the tax rate for Engineers high so they are mostly paying for this boost themselves.

[13-Feb-22 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	true, but it keeps running out on the CX, it's kinda hard to believe that the market is weak if all of it keeps selling out


[13-Feb-22 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-22 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	I've started sourcing my own gold on QQ-082b so that I can get a metallurgy base running and I can stop producing AU here on Montem


[17-Feb-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the goal is to eventually import PE, FE, and C to QQ-082b and have it export Connectors and extra capacity, then convert the two FS buildings I made here into PP2s to start utilizing the AL that my AMLs are producing OR to take on the start of the electronics chain with a CLR and just crank out those outputs for SCA owners to consume.


[17-Feb-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I put a lot of thought into what I wanted to do with Montem and my true longterm goal is to just run AMLs here and almost nothing else but basic resource extraction

**Kronk87TK**:	Hi you all! as a fledgling construction company I'm planning my next moves, and I've noticed that there are many pop infrastructure projects that could use some products I might provide right now or in the near future...is the upkeep and upgrade of those made only by donations or are there some kind of government contracts somewhere that I can't find? for how much I like the idea of contributing to the growth of the planet, I'm not sure I can afford to give those away for free, so early in my career :)


[23-Feb-22 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	@Kronk no need for donations. Rubicate the governor receives our taxes and keeps the upkeeps filled. I believe Rubi normally purchases the materials from the cx as it's a fair method to ensure all players can potential partake.


[23-Feb-22 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-22 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Hey Rubicate, for the next government program you should consider running the Advanced Education III - It's been confirmed by the Dev's and Montem would get MASSIVE amounts of Engineers and Scientists from it for a very cheap price. If that's still something that people on Montem want?


[24-Feb-22 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	It should bring in about 1,000 Engineers and 27 Scienticts in the first week.


[24-Feb-22 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	For an example of how the program effects the POPR, check out the latest Verdant POPR - it's insane.


[24-Feb-22 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	it requires SO much time


[24-Feb-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there's even huge demand for HER


[24-Feb-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	holy shit you need like 100 pioneers to provide enough FIM for 400 engineers


[24-Feb-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	600 pioneers*


[24-Feb-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yes, it takes dedicated bases to support an ENG setup


[24-Feb-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and since FIM requires HER which requires DDT you also actually need LABs too


[24-Feb-22 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and DDT requires CL, so you need a CHP also to make CL from HAL


[24-Feb-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so you actually need something like 680 PIOs, 140 Settlers, and 70 techs


[24-Feb-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you need circie and an agriculture planet


[24-Feb-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and that's _just to make the DDT -> HER -> FIM_ that doesn't even account for extracting HAL to make the CL recipe in the CHP


[24-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or burning the burnables to make C


[24-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	circie and verdant sit nicely - though the water requirements are so slim that you could technically save verdant for more water intensive requirements


[24-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and just put it on any farmable world


[24-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But the point of that is that FIM is a literal nightmare


[24-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and it is probably _the_ reason why you would want to wait on ENG full employment, PDAs coming in second


[24-Feb-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So if you get new players to join the game and they want to make some easy money, point them at HER + FIM


[24-Feb-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	At current rates FIM goes for like 1,250 which is 2,500 per 12h base in a FP or 5K per FP gross consuming RAT+HER and making FIM. You would consume 2 HER per day per building which equates to one FRM making HER per FP


[24-Feb-22 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you were to buy DDT off the CX right now it would cost you ~ 1,900, less the consumables to feed a PIO workforce and 4 RAT, that's a fairly OK profit margin.

**Fuyutsuki**:	the DDT gets split in half over a FP meaning that the materials input to the FP (right now) is something like 950 + 140 = 1090, so your pre-OpEx per run is 1410. For a FP that's pretty good (on PIOs)


[24-Feb-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I am sitting on 100 DDT at the moment, can sell cheaper than the CX prices


[24-Feb-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	On some quick napkin math that FP is pulling down 3.1k NCC daily profits


[24-Feb-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's better than a UTS farm in an FS by a factor of ~ 6x


[24-Feb-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_from a PIO building_


[24-Feb-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So point new players into making FIM, it's actually going to be a gold-mine until it's overproduced.


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I just ran the math about reformatting some things


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	totally achievable


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I could spin up 56 FIM\day


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and have about 12 HER\day leftover to sell


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though I'd need a second glass ship in hortus


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well, as the current ENG board states, we would have 692 engineers at full employment.


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because 300t\day from prom--> avalon is not realistic with one ship


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or maybe the devs will implement ship upgrades which would be awesome


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	would save stranded glass ships and allow you to upgrade them


[24-Feb-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Currently we would be (as a planet) consuming 27.68 FIM per day


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_that's just on Moria_


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	don't look at circie


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think I'm going to do this


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I have no doubts that you would be able to sell your FIM around the Universe


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	thanks for pointing me to this shortage I didn't really know existed


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Thank the Robots dude


[24-Feb-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	one of my competitive agents came up with this strategy


[24-Feb-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	Prisim is basically paid for at this point, just waiting for a couple orders to fill and ship the stuff out there


[24-Feb-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Anyway, I gotta run. GL making money from engineer hunger.


[24-Feb-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	verdant is like $275k to build out, plus another 100k for the HQ upgrade


[24-Feb-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	done & done


[24-Feb-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cherrio


[24-Feb-22 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	plus that FIM need is just going to start increasing with the gov programs allowing for easier education upwards


[24-Feb-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	wondering how long until it starts getting overproduced... might be a while seeing how other ENG consumables aren't that easy either


[24-Feb-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	demand for ENG is going to be strong as long as those SE mm's are still in place


[24-Feb-22 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if UTS MM ain't removed, don't see why EDC MM will be imo


[24-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	ngl I am for nerfing the EDC MM lol


[24-Feb-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	as I sit on 33 of them


[24-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's too "Easy"


[24-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for that high of a tier mm


[24-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	imo


[24-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or each player should only be able to sell "X" units per day


[24-Feb-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	@Azorth same... me with UTS as i actively churn them out


[24-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to prevent someone from just filling a planet with SE


[24-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and printing money


[24-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	Idk I priced it out a while back, full 1000m2 base would make 4.9 mil a week after the old taxes on Circe and buying CONs


[24-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	seems broken


[24-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I just did the same and yeah


[24-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	upfront cost is huge, millions


[24-Feb-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah the ROI period is like 7 days


[24-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cost of production is like 1400\u


[24-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I mean its nothing when you make your own Rfabs, and just reinvest EDC sales into buying other peoples Rfabs to make it go faster (when there were some on the market that is).  Before all the Rfab makers saw they make more money doing EDC than selling Rfabs


[24-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well the universe is out of rfabs, all the cx's are empty


[24-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(I'm sure the seconary markets have them, but still)


[24-Feb-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	Thats cause all the Rfabs makers are doing EDC now that its been pointed out many times


[24-Feb-22 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I for one tore my base down, it was making 12 Rfabs a day.


[24-Feb-22 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	sigh


[24-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yay for game balance


[24-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I just want to try a universe with no MMs tbh.  Little over people farming MMs


[24-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you need inflation somehow


[24-Feb-22 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	without mm's, taxes and warehouse fees would reduce the currency supply to zero


[24-Feb-22 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	They need to hurry up and add the quests then.  If it ain't enough, just tack on more money to the government (ontop of the taxes they collect).  Would help speed up infrastructure if they had more than just tax money


[24-Feb-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I like government mm's - in a way. each planetary government should have a "cx" as it were so that people could buy\sell the government requirements in a auction


[24-Feb-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but the mm's would come from tax revenue being multipleied, if players pay 100,000 in taxes, the government gets that 100k and an additional 30, 50k, 80k or whatever


[24-Feb-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and that would be spent on common economic items, rather than just rich players printing money


[24-Feb-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but idk mm's are needed imo


[24-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think the high tech ones, like on SP or CBX


[24-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	are good overall. complex supplychains, encourage expansion to weird systems


[24-Feb-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I don't think MMs are needed if they change a few things


[24-Feb-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	I am just waiting for when lots of people go for the EDC MM and it gets nerfed lol.


[24-Feb-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah it needs to go to like 8000


[24-Feb-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's already too late to try and prevent market disruption


[24-Feb-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but the longer they wait the more worser it gets


[24-Feb-22 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FIM won't start being overproduced, cheap HER and DDT will end


[24-Feb-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Because if there's loads of money to be made long term, it won't be the pio building doing it


[24-Feb-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or maybe the CL suppliers?


[24-Feb-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which are pio/settler but on very specific worlds


[24-Feb-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... prefabs might not be a bad business to be in either since all these people expanding will need them

[24-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	@Rubicate Something I hadn't quite considered before with the Advanced Education III, Montem would likely lose about 24k PIO's to Educating to Settlers. That's before PIO Migration kicks in, so it will be less, but we may end up with some open PIO jobs after POPR. Running multiple weeks of it would cause massive issues, but I would think just 1 week of it would more than suffice any demand for high tier pops.


[24-Feb-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Is there a less effective version of it?


[24-Feb-22 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yes, there should be levels 1, 2 and 3. For a 10%, 15% and 30% boost. I would say it's better to run a level 3 and then a Happiness boost the following week to reclaim PIO numbers rather than running any lesser level. Though we don't have enough information on it yet to be sure.

[25-Feb-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you want to buy the BGCs, PG, and BE from me as a package, I'm willing to split the CBMs. If you're interested in this, we should probably hash out the details privately.

[01-Mar-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can post some more.


[01-Mar-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	There's 200 @ 40/u


[01-Mar-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	big thanks


[01-Mar-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	the last time I bought I bought 500 of the stuff, so I just kinda forgot to restock


[01-Mar-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It happens. If you find yourself near the 200s again let me know so I can import a full ship from YI-280j


[01-Mar-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll let you buy half a ship (900) for 30/u and give you bulk pricing (27k for 900 MG)


[01-Mar-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I might take you up on your offer soon Fuyu, but are you able to fill a 2k ship?


[01-Mar-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That would require something like ~7400 MG


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I might just fly out to Prdgi's and pick it up


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I would need to build additional BMPs on YI-280j to handle something like that


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh I don't mind if you shop it around. He has far more throughput than I do


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	YI is just better for me to fly too


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	so I asked you first


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I never intended to unseat Prdgi's MG empire, just to provide for people local on Montem.


[01-Mar-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But if you want to have a more convenient flight, I have spare space on YI-280j that I can develop out


[01-Mar-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I don't mind doing it either, have a lot of unemployed PIOs out there


[01-Mar-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	We only consume a bit above 200u of MG daily on Circe, so I'm just trying to stock up on it


[01-Mar-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I could build 3 more BMPs and produce 360 per day


[01-Mar-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	200 per DAY jesus


[01-Mar-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's not that bad


[01-Mar-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	that's just for Circe lol, doesn't include other planets


[01-Mar-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Jacuribu was using 410 back when he was playing


[01-Mar-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	We use 500+ daily it looks like spread amongst all our planets


[01-Mar-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	As my wife says, "That's quite a load."


[01-Mar-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Unrelated to things of a NSFW nature, if I increased my output capacity on 280j, would you actually consume it? Between MG + BER we could fill ships to Circe somewhat easily.


[01-Mar-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	sure, I won't mind having a stockpile


[01-Mar-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	btw, I stopped making BE myself Fuyu, the other AML stuff are eating all my production


[01-Mar-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Surely you're not the only AML owner out there?


[01-Mar-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	nah, you know Cvelle has them as well


[01-Mar-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Yep, he recently walked off YI-280j with like 790 BER. He's probably doing fine.


[01-Mar-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I will go ahead and ship the FABs out to YI-280j for more MG production when my ship gets to Moria for the turn-around. I have to stop by Vallis and pick up the EMC consumables first, then bring them to Montem, pick up the rest of the fabs, and then head out. But it is something that I'm going to do.


[01-Mar-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Two very large (12.5k) shipping contracts to move BGO from QQ-082b to Montem. This is a 1d round-trip (8h each direction) if you max out your reactor and consume a little more STL fuel.

**realbandit**:	A few people have mentioned it seems like there was a bug with which program was run though. If next weeks program is open, @Rubicate could run the Happiness boost and get us a whole bunch of new PIO's?

[02-Mar-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	People of Montem! In the newest announcement, there is a patchlog, and in it, it appears that the crazy OP education program is being nerfed. And rightfully so


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	It gave us a lot of Technicians, Engineers and Scientists for almost no effort, crazy OP.


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The downside was that it also ate into our pioneers somewhat.


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_good thing I built that EMERGENCY CENTER_


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	because if you have an emergency now you can turn it on


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	=0


[07-Mar-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The question is, should we run the Education program one more time before it is nerfed? It will be the last chance to get extra technicans, engineers and scientists cheaply


[07-Mar-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	The downside is that it will eat even more into our pioneers, and we'll see another week of being short on those before we turn it around.


[07-Mar-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Opinions?


[07-Mar-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	In favor


[07-Mar-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Short term pain sucks, but PIOs are theoretically easy to get.


[07-Mar-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Screws over some players without PRO (and I would argue a majority of the planet) but they shouldn't feel it super hard since their bases aren't like 1k/1k pio


[07-Mar-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	basically anyone with more than 600 PIOs is going to feel the crunch.


[07-Mar-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	normally I wouldn't be in favor, but it's such a crazy strong effect, we are talking something that's maybe x50 better than it should be, so we'd be getting a lot of future growth for very little tax money


[07-Mar-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	grumble.... I have 820 PIO... well, 706 right now...


[07-Mar-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	If we do go for it, I promise that all of Montem's resources will be directed towards boosting Pio for many weeks in a row afterwards


[07-Mar-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	But I don't wanna force it if players are unhappy


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think this may be your first "It's for your own good" unpopular decision


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Are current PIO levels going to be eroded even more?


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh yes.


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh yes they will.


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sigh


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	most likely a repeat of the previous cycle


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	granted


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	_this time_


[07-Mar-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	we have high PIO unemp.


[07-Mar-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so maybe it will be slightly offset?


[07-Mar-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	anyone running engineers sure is happy I bet


[07-Mar-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	does someone have 10 LSE for sale for me ... i somehow am unable to do basic math when buying stuff


[07-Mar-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	My PIOs are not doing anything super critical, so I guess I can take another hit


[07-Mar-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I am running engineers too.


[07-Mar-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have 610 pio's... so I guess we'll see


[07-Mar-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	see if I get hit by the cruse of the robin


[07-Mar-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I am in favor of running it, short term pain, long term reward


[07-Mar-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I am as well, because yeah you're right


[07-Mar-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	for those of us that have been here for a while...it was like 6 months of slow growth in 1 shot


[07-Mar-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and having the higher tier pops around will also make more money in taxes to pay for the PIO remediation costs

**Talmar**:	being down a few PIO's is fine, but I'm down something like 20%. That's just not working for me right now.


[07-Mar-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	i think is not the right moment maybe when the PIOs recover a little bit i voted no


[07-Mar-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	And you must realize that this is also a Noob planet, where a lot of new players start. We need to have a supply of workers for them, when they come into the game.


[07-Mar-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	pio shortage won't affect new players


[07-Mar-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	they get +200 for free from the void


[07-Mar-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and round robin protects them


[07-Mar-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yes medium-new-ish players will be hit


[07-Mar-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I don't think the pio population can sustain another week


[07-Mar-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I don't either


[07-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tho we will have massive immigration, since it was already over 70% happiness with 3.3% unemployment


[07-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	with 0% unemployment it's going to skyrocket


[07-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	especially as the safety demands will lower


[07-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	very possible we could see 10 or 15k migration


[07-Mar-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I'm not a popi expert, but even if we get a 15K Pio migration, and we get another 20K loss do to education, we will still lose another 5K Pio's.


[07-Mar-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I think we might need to build some higher tier culture buildings to help keep those higher tier pops


[07-Mar-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You know me, my position has always been screw the pioneers. Of course I don't employ anything beyond techs on this planet, so it doesn't actually matter either way


[07-Mar-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, good for you, but bad for everyone else. I employ about 75% Pios here, so this does matter to me. And I am down around 16% in that regard


[07-Mar-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	oh, just noticed that we lost 25K to Edu, not 20K, so even if we were to get 15K migration, we would still lose another 10K Pios. That would be bad


[07-Mar-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Seems a bit pointless. There were not enough jobs for all the engineers we got last time.

**KenFair**:	That said, I'm okay with getting the long-term benefit of pulling in more high-level workers.


[08-Mar-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KenFair**:	I'd like to move up to be able to employ more of them. But without there being more of a high-level economy, it doesn't make financial sense to do so.


[08-Mar-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Who needs scientists. WAI now available at a CX near you.


[08-Mar-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Oh hands down it would be a SL


[08-Mar-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but it looks like someone already employed the SCIs


[08-Mar-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you look at the construction screen there is a (3) next to the 20 meaning someone already employed SCIs


[08-Mar-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	(at least that's what I think it means)


[08-Mar-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Well I can sell you HB5 afabs for 450k :) Lots of SD time, and a bit of SE time to get the NN before you can even start the WAI.


[08-Mar-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**badaZ76**:	bro this is a confusing game


[08-Mar-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	^


[08-Mar-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I only have 4 AMLs :(


[08-Mar-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would honestly want to build the SD first


[08-Mar-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think the APF might be next


[08-Mar-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have to check to make sure I can keep it busy


[08-Mar-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	@CaptainIncognito do you want to outsource W refinement


[08-Mar-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No, I have that part done


[08-Mar-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have AMLs on Yi-280d where my AST is


[08-Mar-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You just need me to plug you with BTS or are you buying it from SNF?


[08-Mar-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and where TI can be smelted for other things


[08-Mar-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I've got enough for the first ship


[08-Mar-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might consider producing HYRs regularly though


[08-Mar-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since SNF's ships seem to have gone a different route


[08-Mar-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and ultimately return to plan A, that I made back when I first started the company


[08-Mar-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm kind of disconnected from NEM as a whole because I operate in Moria and they're all over in Arclight


[08-Mar-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Making ship propulsion systems


[08-Mar-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so I'm always looking for stuff to do


[08-Mar-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I'll keep buying lots of BER


[08-Mar-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I bought a bunch yesterday to ship to Circe


[08-Mar-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I really need to sit down and figure out ship production once I get home tonight


[08-Mar-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm going to move a shipload to Circe for easy access in the future


[08-Mar-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think one of the biggest issues we will have in the near future is tech/sci consumables


[08-Mar-22 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I might need to bite the bullet and make an MCA


[08-Mar-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah, I need to fly home before I commit to doing serious thinking about this game :(


[08-Mar-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I feel that. I'm about to completely re-work my Montem base


[08-Mar-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I think it's time I removed my FRM + INC + SMEs here


[08-Mar-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	they are my oldest buildings


[08-Mar-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or maybe I keep the INCs to make local C to feed PE + PG production for my PP2s, but ditch the SMEs and FRMs


[08-Mar-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	also I'm laughing at the range on the CX of WAI, a bid for like 5.6k and an ask for 179k lol


[08-Mar-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	People laughed at my 50k sell on BTS and BER too, but they did their jobs


[08-Mar-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	It just kind of hurts a little knowing that we're giving up the equivalent of months of effort and millions of NCC of investment.


[08-Mar-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I put up a couple WAIs at 80k. That narrows the range by more than half


[08-Mar-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, boo pioneers!


[08-Mar-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Mar-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Mar-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Mar-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Mar-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	only problem is the lead time :\


[15-Mar-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	You have a little bit of time to start producing them


[15-Mar-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just got the RFABs for my SCA


[15-Mar-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well if you want to buy some let me know now so I can change the production q


[15-Mar-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because I'm doing a bunch of PSL at first


[15-Mar-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok I added it to the queue


[15-Mar-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	production starts in a day


[15-Mar-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	what kind of price do you want to seek?


[15-Mar-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	one minute please


[15-Mar-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so opportunitiy cost vs. making PSL is my benchmark


[15-Mar-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because that was my original plan


[15-Mar-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I was assuming PSL @1600


[15-Mar-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	equilibrium for that on PSS in terms of ROI is 470\ea for PSS


[15-Mar-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so 450ea? or is that too steep


[15-Mar-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	435?


[15-Mar-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That might be too low


[15-Mar-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	How about 445


[15-Mar-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Cash upfront = 178k


[15-Mar-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	420 with 100% pre-payment, 430 with 50% pre-payment, or 450 with cash on delivery


[15-Mar-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'll prepay the whole order at 420 (nice)


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	400 units?


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lead time will be in line with the final delivery of NL then; it will all come back on the same ship


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	$168k


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Can you ship it in cunks?


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	chunks*


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I can do 50\50 with the NL


[15-Mar-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That works


[15-Mar-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if you set up the sells, I will take them


[15-Mar-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ok


[15-Mar-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	post a DW ad for $168k then


[15-Mar-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	a buy or sell?


[15-Mar-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I always get them reversed for private orders


[15-Mar-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	nvm


[15-Mar-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	LMA OT-580b/61334


[15-Mar-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I had it backwards in my mind lol


[15-Mar-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	PSS buys are up


[15-Mar-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so you can direct provision


[15-Mar-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh wait shit I didn't look at that right away. that might not be enough time accounting for shipping time


[15-Mar-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cause it takes a day to bring it in from 001a


[15-Mar-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	extend if needed. I'll be in touch as the deadline approaches


[15-Mar-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'll get to two experts quite quickly


[15-Mar-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so production rampup will be fast


[15-Mar-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It's fine if we miss the times a little bit


[15-Mar-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I can always just hold off on the SCA going up


[15-Mar-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and the second ontract (the 20d) I have no problem extending (or the 10d for that matter)


[15-Mar-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	kk. we're fortunate, I just built the base and it's missing like 60% of it's workforce but the pop report hits in a couple hours

**Fuyutsuki**:	I've been selling it at way below market


[15-Mar-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and now I can actually use it


[15-Mar-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the second might not need another day, we'll see


[15-Mar-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	wait, i might have miss read that...


[15-Mar-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Nope, I'm bringing in a huge amount of LST to the Moria CX


[15-Mar-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm going to post it for sale at 35 and then post a buy order for like 10,000 LST at 34.01


[15-Mar-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I've decided to become a liquidity provider for LST


[15-Mar-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it's going to destroy a lot of small players LST farming, but their loss will not be missed


[15-Mar-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	It takes me literally a week to produce 2,000 LST


[15-Mar-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	they should be doing other things


[15-Mar-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL


[15-Mar-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I almost did that on DW on HRT a few weeks ago


[15-Mar-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but then someone showed up with like 20,000 DW or something silly


[15-Mar-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I got scared


[15-Mar-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Easier to move DW than it is LST


[15-Mar-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the value to mass\size is much more favorable, yes


[15-Mar-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	unless you can't keep up with demand


[15-Mar-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	can you import 1000 LST per day?


[15-Mar-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cause your LP won't work


[15-Mar-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	If people are selling me LST at the CX I can turn it around


[15-Mar-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I just have to find a number that works


[15-Mar-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and if I get my own 3k/1k then I will be able to move in a lot of LST per day


[15-Mar-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would just build more EXTs on LS-231b and literally flood the market with rocks

**lowstrife**:	༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ TAKE MY ROCKS, I HAVE MANY ROCKS - FUYUTSUKI ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ

[15-Mar-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I already have my WCB made


[15-Mar-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and yeah, 1k LST per trip is beasty


[15-Mar-22 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But the goal with being a LP is that you keep a tight spread. The reason people don't do it with commodities is that they'll just get sniped.


[15-Mar-22 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	But in my case, if I'm bringing in huge amounts of LST on a regular basis, I literally will make it neigh impossible to compete and force out players which are inefficient


[15-Mar-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Of course that has the effect of constraining supply which moves price up


[15-Mar-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but as that happens, I would slowly move the strike of my liquidity center upwards to match it until the market is stable


[15-Mar-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if I keep a spread of like 5.0, there's space there for people who don't want instant liquidity


[15-Mar-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but if that prevents business from taking place as a LP, I just tighten the vice until it does

**IDKanything**:	if you just have a CM here and not build anything you still have that 200 pio you get for free, they dont disappear into the reserve until you build your first production line... unless they built production lines before but demolished after for whatever reason

**Fuyutsuki**:	Hey


[22-Mar-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I could have priced it at 20


[22-Mar-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but there is such little supply that I'm taking advantage of the bubble while I can


[22-Mar-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	indeed, indeed


[22-Mar-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	plus, moving 3500 MCG at once isn't something that a regular person can do


[22-Mar-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	you have to have a 2k ship


[22-Mar-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I have my prices layered to give people a chance rather than just saying, "ahahaha, it's 32, pay me"


[22-Mar-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	if people can't fill the gap by that point in time, the higher prices will get hit


[22-Mar-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but I don't want Moria folks unable to do anything just because there's no MCG available (especially for our non-pro population)


[22-Mar-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm probably going to build a third and fourth BMP on LS-231b to produce 1k MCG per day


[22-Mar-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but moving it is the hard part


[22-Mar-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PawnStorm**:	How many new players would we need, for Montem to become a farming planet. As the fertile FRM space would have become essential?

[27-Mar-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is no GG with H2O, but there is a few ice balls with it. I thought about setting a base on one of them


[28-Mar-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I thought about building a 2k ship and setting up a outpost on one of them


[28-Mar-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Mineral H2O is far, far, far worse than Liquid H2O from RIGs


[28-Mar-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yup, always go for liquid H2O if possible even if it looks worse on the PLI screen it's likely better overall


[28-Mar-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I believe I did a comparison between DW-739d and Danakil(OT-442b) a while back that showed that they are pretty much equal in production with a full base (I may be off a bit can't remember) but the point stands


[28-Mar-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentStu**:	Is there a way to see or calculate how much a resource extracting building will pull from a particular planet prior to building?  Moar density is clearly better but it's difficult to run the cost trades without the specifics


[28-Mar-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	fio.fnar.net


[28-Mar-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerOmmel**:	How much do you need?


[30-Mar-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Well, I am looking for a long-term partner at the moment for just buying FEO from. If that interests you, DM me :)


[30-Mar-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I could set up a REX for you on a heavy FEO planet but you would be handling all the logistics


[30-Mar-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	anyone do TRU here? looking for 20 for my HQ upgrade


[30-Mar-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	@fuyutsuki I don't think that is currently in my current scope of adding logistics into my partnership for FEO as it is too heavy to transport. I think that would cut too much into what I would like to have going soon


[30-Mar-22 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah, I do normally, but I just shipped my TRU out :(


[30-Mar-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	There-in lies the challenge with FEO Dustin.


[30-Mar-22 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Yes it is! Hopefully can provide a good offer for it :)


[30-Mar-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	When I get a FTL hauler, I might be able to help you with that


[30-Mar-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but right now I can't do much to help you because I'm bottlenecked by ships


[30-Mar-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Perhaps in the future. Since I have some disposable income, I am looking into expanding deeper into the construction prefabs. Where ALO isn't hard to transport in a decent bulk xD


[30-Mar-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	ALO is like... the way to go I think


[30-Mar-22 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	I have been meaning to get into it, but I have been lazy lol


[30-Mar-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I used to just sell the AL I produced through BER refinement but the price was going down because I put out so much


[30-Mar-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	same thing with SI


[30-Mar-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	So I ended up finding an outlet for both (PP2s for the AL and SCA making ROM for the SI)


[30-Mar-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	That is the plan. Going to look forward to getting PP2s up and going


[30-Mar-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the only difference is that you'll need 4 SMEs to run 2 PP2s


[30-Mar-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I will be using 3 AMLs to feed 2 PP2s + 1 SCA


[30-Mar-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DaddyDustin**:	Ah I see, I haven't looked into AMLs yet to be honest. At least recently. I just planned to expand my PP1 production a decent amount before considering diving into something else honestly

[31-Mar-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atrian**:	Thats correct and noted


[31-Mar-22 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	If you find yourself in need of POL outputs, SCA outputs, Beryllium, BFabs, LFabs, or you want to rent an AML by paying for the production time (like ZIR contract refinement), let me know and I'll give you quotes


[31-Mar-22 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I almost always lock the price of PG @ 18 even if the market is retarded, but it depends strongly on the price of Hydrogen.


[31-Mar-22 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	which right now is... not great H.NC1


[31-Mar-22 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	o wow what happened to that price... kinda happy i have a stockpile of it now


[31-Mar-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	My guess is shipping constraints or manipulation as people over-correct to produce PG.NC1


[31-Mar-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or FF.NC1


[31-Mar-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentStu**:	what is going on with the BBH supply at Moria Station?


[05-Apr-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	just see the 7 day price chart and you can tell why prices went up


[05-Apr-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentStu**:	i mean that shows the trend, but I'm curious why supply has dried up


[05-Apr-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentStu**:	demand might be up a little, but not enough to warrant supply drying up entirly


[05-Apr-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	hover over the green bars, you can see the numbers being bought directly from the supply


[05-Apr-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	there were some decently big purchases which sucked up the supply


[05-Apr-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	generally though... few months back bfab prices were super low and barely profitable if not break-even... would not be surprised if it turned people away from building many PP1/2s... but safe to assume some of the rise is due to the new player waves.


[05-Apr-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	my brain too smol to do any proper analysis on the market


[05-Apr-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	We need to sort out POPR


[06-Apr-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Apr-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Apr-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, if you are trying to save on fuel, shipping contracts are very good. With how often people go to the CX (commodity exchange) your stuff is almost guaranteed to get picked up

**SHOTFUN**:	also, if you ever need to move something yourself, you can pick some up to ease the fuel cost


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zdaz14**:	I saw that. Is there a fair price to pay for hauling goods? Like X per ton? I was throwing together an excel doc and the fuel costs are one of the big things I noticed


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	usually I throw up 5 NCC/max (either weight or volume, whichever is greater) for a trip to the CX or back


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	if you are trying to ship to another system (say Benton) it's a little more complicated and I just kinda wing it


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zdaz14**:	Cool, appreciate the info! I can tell this is going to suck up a lot of my time


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well, good luck! and remember, if shit doesn't work out, you don't have to stick with your original industry


[10-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	there are no requirements for that


[10-Apr-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah @zdaz I try to ask for and offer 5/u minimum within the system and do more for out of system, typically offering 10-12k for full shiploads

[11-Apr-22 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	if you need b-fabs, just throw up a buy at a reasonable price, and someone will fill it


[11-Apr-22 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I see lots of unreasonable prices up on the LM, like someone trying to buy DDT for 1100/u! LOL! good luck with that!


[11-Apr-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	As i calculate the cost of making 1 DDT being 608,35 (without consumables), it doesn't seem that unreasonable :)


[11-Apr-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, if you ignore the 435 creds you need for the pop upkeep, the building maintenance, and the building ROI, then sure, perfectly so!! Everyone likes to sell things at a loss!


[11-Apr-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	As someone who makes the entire supply chain of DDT, you are way off on that number


[11-Apr-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	I don't know , but maybe heard of corp prices?


[11-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Oh I'm just disputing your calculation I'm not adjudicating how resonable your price is


[11-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	my corp prices for the inputs come out to 610. But that difference is negligible


[11-Apr-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	i just have seen very little bfab trade on montem lm.


[11-Apr-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	it's not the input costs, it's the other costs that are involved. Going price for DDT is around 2K, maybe a bit more


[11-Apr-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I sold ~20 @3k last week


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	someone was desperate


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Well, it might be that we are used to internal trades with not a lot of profits ;)


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Talmar oh absolutely, just wanted to add context


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well given that you can dump DDT to asks at 2k, who cares about the costs?


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er... bids


[11-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	but then kom is even better money


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think DDT stopped being good money at some point


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	it's all about the same.


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but then FIM demand took off


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	FIM demand only took off because of a bug


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a bug?


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the growth was hugely unnatural and a large source of VOL


[11-Apr-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	It all gets back to HAL access


[11-Apr-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Apr-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	oh that


[11-Apr-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also the MMs


[11-Apr-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	EDC being free money with no logistics for just the cost of some engis


[11-Apr-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Apr-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Apr-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	the consumables for the LAB costs around 435-450. In that range somewhere


[11-Apr-22 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Then you have the Tax to run the line. And, as stated earlier, upkeep costs, and ROI on the building. Selling for 1100 is at a loss. A pretty significant one, too


[11-Apr-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	selling what for 1100? EDC MM buy order is 16000 and IDC MM is 20000


[11-Apr-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think he's still talking about DDT


[11-Apr-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	thought we were still talking about the DDT


[11-Apr-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	EDC's are a joke


[11-Apr-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	I for one am glad NEO is subsidizing arts and humanities


[11-Apr-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I dump over half the EDCs I make into popi though


[11-Apr-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If the MM were lower, it would be more viable to buy those and feed them in

**Rubicate**:	PSA: The commodity SUN is extremely underproduced, it's always selling out on the CX


[15-Apr-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I was going to put up a manufacturing base today and push some SUN and OFF through it


[15-Apr-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	but i may have to setup a EXT/SME .. i cant keep up with FE for this base :/


[15-Apr-22 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	But.. if anyone has a spare 100-150 units of FE then I could skip that

**Rubicate**:	People of Montem! This is your governor speaking. We are currently building some infrastructure projects, a Security Drone Post and a Planteary Broadcasting Hub. I've acquired most of the materials to build these, but it's eaten into our tax funds quite heavily, and I had buy some of the R-fabs as a loan with future payement. To ensure everything is going smoothly, I will be enacting a modest temporary tax increase to help pay for them, which will revert within only a few weeks. Public opinions?


[17-Apr-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	Cool lets do it

**Rubicate**:	Elnor Settlers aren't really getting anything more than Pioneers out of the tax funds so I feel it's unfair to tax them more


[17-Apr-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I mentioned a couple months ago when bfabs were 900-1200 that C, FE, and bfabs going to moon


[18-Apr-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	some ppl didnt agree


[18-Apr-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	now we MM on bfabs except BTA


[18-Apr-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i agreed :P :D


[18-Apr-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	O probably going to be an issue also


[18-Apr-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	once upon a time BSE and BBH were at the buy MM... super duper long ago


[18-Apr-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might start making aluminum BBHs again


[18-Apr-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	why?


[18-Apr-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	AL tough market


[18-Apr-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Because they cost like 1400 to make and sell for 2k+


[18-Apr-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	AL is a lot better than FE in terms of how much space they take up in base inventory, both the ore and metal itself


[18-Apr-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I don't have enough HSEs and PSLs yet to make iron bfabs


[18-Apr-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	i agree AL much better then FE for that


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just finished laying the foundations for my BDE factory


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Still not really worth making those out of PG


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which just shows how bad that recipe is


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	XD


[18-Apr-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	theres been alot of new PP1's going up though too.  bfab prices will correct in 4-5 weeks would be my bet


[18-Apr-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	maybe sooner depending how this steam launch goes


[18-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Took longer than that when the universe started though


[18-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	if it flops,, we will be bouncing the MM bid lol


[18-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	very dependent on how much of those bfabs will go to the market and not to personal usage


[18-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	we have more capital to scale up, but shipping that much FE/LST would be hard for logistic reasons


[18-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And I go through so many bfabs just for repairs alone now


[18-Apr-22 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	same. i got 10 PP1s but putting the output of 3-4 aside for repairs that are coming up very soon


[18-Apr-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The worst is I repaired my planets all at once before, so now things break all at once


[18-Apr-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I can do 140-320/day so repairs isnt an issue as much as keeping them fed is lol


[18-Apr-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	oooof


[18-Apr-22 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	All of your bases at the same time? geez


[18-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean not quite, but one month out of 3 will be repair season


[18-Apr-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	makes it easier in the sense that you only need to remember a few dates... but bad in the sense that all buildings must be repaired at same time again and requires all the materials at once


[18-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It can also be a logistics nightmare


[18-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Although that should be easier next time around


[18-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Elnor**:	350 its good or bad prize?


[19-Apr-22 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	currently? 350 is below a few bids in MOR and wayyy lower than the lowest ask price. but usually? its a good price


[19-Apr-22 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**zdaz14**:	Its below a few bids but my volume is 10x most of those bids too :)


[19-Apr-22 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**zdaz14**:	Also if anyone produces C and has excess daily, I'm in need of a supplier. So message me :)


[19-Apr-22 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	...or if they have free space to ship those same 106C to MOR, they can just put up a sell @ ~390/u and make ~4k more  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[19-Apr-22 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	yeah the prize is low actually


[19-Apr-22 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	i can sell it to you for 380/u if you really need it


[19-Apr-22 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	or just 38k the 106units


[19-Apr-22 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	the new smellters...


[19-Apr-22 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	it started spiking with the bfab price increase, just that no one likes to ship C to MOR so the prices just never went down


[19-Apr-22 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	I make just enough C for my own use with the occasional 1-2u excess, and probably so do many others


[19-Apr-22 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaygran**:	yup i have a weekly 30 surplus moreorless so sometime i have a little excess


[19-Apr-22 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just tore down my old C making and haven't had a chance to replace it yet :(


[19-Apr-22 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**zdaz14**:	Looking for a weekly Carbon supplier, need about 140ish per week. Shoot me a message if you have the ability to fill :)


[19-Apr-22 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Carbons going to suck for the next month D:


[19-Apr-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I thought about setting up a C production planet, but it would take awhile to get off the ground


[19-Apr-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	What would be the ideal place to set it up close to MOR?


[19-Apr-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Farm on verdant then ship to?


[19-Apr-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	C prices will go up that could make it a bit more feasible


[19-Apr-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Its better to make C locally on the planet, and ship in the burnable crops


[19-Apr-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but yeah, get the crops from Verdant


[19-Apr-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Which planet would you produce the C on?


[19-Apr-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	OT-889d probably


[19-Apr-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I need to investigate how bad the H2O there is


[19-Apr-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Oh rly?  hmm interesting


[19-Apr-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's probably a bad move actually


[19-Apr-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Danakil would be much better, but I already have a base there


[19-Apr-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I was just going to build a base on Danakil, but decided to do one on Vallis before tomorrow


[19-Apr-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ugh... yeah EXTs for H2O suck


[19-Apr-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ok, so bad plan for OT-889d lol


[19-Apr-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	even by my standards


[19-Apr-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	ya makes sense


[19-Apr-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I was thinking of building a more profit oriented base on Danakil


[19-Apr-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also a C base needs to be 1 jump from the CX tops probably


[19-Apr-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Ya that was a concern that far out


[19-Apr-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also yeah, settling Vallis before it becomes full forever is good


[19-Apr-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Also I am shredding through FE so it does help soften the blow there lol


[19-Apr-22 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	you can buy H2O on CX


[19-Apr-22 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	For now.... yes


[19-Apr-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	i have 3 farms for GRN and HCP and 2 INC. I produce 8C / 14 hours


[19-Apr-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	and i spend 10 H2O/day


[19-Apr-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	this fullfill all my SME


[19-Apr-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	How many SME?


[19-Apr-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Apparently I burn only 20 C or so per day now


[19-Apr-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	i have only 5 SME for some Bfabs


[19-Apr-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I used to burn about 50


[19-Apr-22 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	For this its best way use full combination of HCP, GRN, MAI


[19-Apr-22 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I need 200-300 FE/d  which is about 50-75 C


[19-Apr-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	this its cca 4 INC fulfiled with HCP+MAI+GRN


[19-Apr-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	danakill its good place


[19-Apr-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	have more water


[19-Apr-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	and its only 1 jump


[19-Apr-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	but now CoGC program on Danakil dominate Construction


[19-Apr-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	ya we need to watch here too or we will end up on chem


[19-Apr-22 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Clever of Rubi to raise taxes right before steam launch }:)


[19-Apr-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So, the most C I can squeeze out of TO-392a is 75/day


[19-Apr-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Would require some minor imports and a lot of infrastructure


[19-Apr-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I was wrong... forgetting experts existed lol


[19-Apr-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So... 97 C/day max


[19-Apr-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Would it be worth it?


[19-Apr-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	or too expensive?


[19-Apr-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	i rebuild base on montem for lot of CHEM


[19-Apr-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	would make sense to stick to PIO campaign during new player wave


[19-Apr-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ROI would be 55 days on that base


[19-Apr-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but that's using current C prices


[19-Apr-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er.. nm, that's not including building the CoGC


[19-Apr-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so... probably not


[19-Apr-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I'll stick to making C in places where it makes sense for logical reasons to prefer importing H2O and NS over C


[19-Apr-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	it makes more sense


[19-Apr-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Though honestly, at this point each permit is probably more valuable than the buildings


[19-Apr-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	no kidding


[19-Apr-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Or it 's close


[19-Apr-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My next upgrade is just under 1 million I think


[19-Apr-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	oof


[19-Apr-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er... I guess now they alternate between expensive and cheap


[19-Apr-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so realistically more like 500-600k each for the next pair


[19-Apr-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This one is 32 afabs


[19-Apr-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	17 SME, 6 INC, 1 STO is 499 area.  Will do 167 FE/day and 25 C/day surplus


[19-Apr-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	32 afabs ouch lol


[19-Apr-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	167 FE/day its lot of space


[19-Apr-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	1314


[19-Apr-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Will keep a 1500 warehouse on the side also for backup


[19-Apr-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	so 8k of space will be sufficient


[19-Apr-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	STO is a game changer lol

**Xk37**:	That and we're getting hijacked by Chemistry. Really? Chemistry? On Montem? I mean, I could see Construction or Manufacturing or maybe even Metallurgy... but Chemistry? SMH...


[19-Apr-22 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	maybe if you people would vote for something other than pioneers I wouldn't vote for chemistry


[19-Apr-22 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've got more pioneers than all the others combined. So I vote pioneer. I realize specializing is better, but Montem is not really a specialized planet. Not for me anyway.


[19-Apr-22 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	i'ts kinda construction central


[19-Apr-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	if it stood a chance of winning, I'd vote for that, even though I left construction a long time ago


[19-Apr-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I see - so that's why you vote chemistry. makes sense


[19-Apr-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I guess I'll have a bunch more Flux and NS for a while.


[19-Apr-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	there are 3 reasons I vote chemistry: First and foremost Montem should vote for what it's best at, construction, second I really want to see all the people who are hardcore for pioneers get real buthurt that they lost 10%, and 3 I only have chemistry buildings because I saw a need and filled it


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	We need all pio voters go to construction , i mean look at the prices we are buggin out here!!


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	says the guy who literally just voted for pioneers


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Well, I'm not 'butthurt' nor am I 'hardcore for pioneers'. 10% is no big deal. It just means I'll have to fine tune my production lines a bit.


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'm not referring to you


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	😳


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	probably around August/September time frame this conversation came up, just with construction instead of chemistry and there were like 2 or 3 guys that got really upset about just the idea of flipping the CoGC


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	okay changing my vote to construction.


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	don't remember who they were, but I would love to see them complain about it


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I don't remember but it doesn't surprise me I guess.


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	one of them was talking about how the loss of 10% would ruin his entire base


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I just want to insert a little chaos here


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I mean, if we switch to chemistry it would solve a lot of problems for me - I could move all my AMLs and LABs from Umbra to here.


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I advocated construction for a long time, and it's what I'd want, but now I'm voting chemistry to finally break the pioneers' stranglehold on power


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	But I doubt it will be chemistry for more than 1 week


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	we don't need any more engineer problems :(


[20-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	I only run 5 EXTs here so... my vote isn't that much nor will a diff CoGC really bother me so sure I can change to something other than pioneers


[20-Apr-22 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	excellent. Let the chemicals flow! for this week anyway


[20-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I apparently have almost 200 pioneers again


[20-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	We can't be switching back and forth though. It makes it hard to plan.


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, chem would be kind of weird


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	If we go chemistry, we should stick with chemistry. same for construction.


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I doubt people would switch into/out of construction though


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	it's fine if it's just a week of chem


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it's stupidly profitable ATM


[20-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	like, lets be real here. Grand scheme of things, chem is just a meme week, then we can actually do construction


[20-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	I mean, let this week just be a waking call for all those not voting i guess


[20-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah maybe. I'm game to vote construction again next time


[20-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	yea, I'm going to have so much ES if chem passes


[20-Apr-22 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Good, maybe ES prices will finally fall


[20-Apr-22 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	(says the person trying to sell it for 5k)


[20-Apr-22 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I can make them fall right now


[20-Apr-22 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but on a serious note, I'm trying to make sure that there is some supply left available


[20-Apr-22 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I can sell out to all the buys and still have more than people will use


[20-Apr-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	How much do you have?


[20-Apr-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	I'd rather not admit to my hoarding


[20-Apr-22 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SHOTFUN**:	well, the specifics of my hoarding


[20-Apr-22 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I make my ES on Circe with a CoGC


[20-Apr-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You guys would be surprised on how much Chem is actually done here. All of SNF's NS is made here, plus many other corps NS as well.


[20-Apr-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ah true, the LST is here


[20-Apr-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I run a LAB and 3 POLs here, but mostly for historic reasons


[20-Apr-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That lab is almost a year old now


[20-Apr-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	SNF has 67 CHPs built here lol and I plan to build another 10 pretty soon.


[20-Apr-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	only my CM, a PP2, and some habs have it beat


[20-Apr-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah... I would have built my CHPs on the N GG

[20-Apr-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	LST is annoying to ship, but what else would the inbound ships to there carry


[20-Apr-22 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I mean why not just fill up the GG with COL/RIGs?


[20-Apr-22 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	shipping


[20-Apr-22 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess that's less of an issue now


[20-Apr-22 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	that's what shipping ads are for


[20-Apr-22 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but IIRC those planets make 33 per COL or something silly like that?


[20-Apr-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So full COLs gets you what like 600+ per day?


[20-Apr-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	not enough lol


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	with how much NS really needs


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Who's going to buy it all


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	NS uses ALOT of N


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, except you're in a big corp


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	ask Rubi, he also makes NS here


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	He goes through a ton himself


[20-Apr-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My old plan was to make it all into NS, then turn the NS into RCO in HYFs then dump that to the MM


[20-Apr-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	back before they added the good MMs


[20-Apr-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and when shipping was the limiting factor

[20-Apr-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Saxil**:	Good to be here. Figuring this game out


[20-Apr-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	It's a great game (says someone who has been playing for almost 1k days total)


[20-Apr-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saxil**:	damn


[20-Apr-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	btw I would recommend making BSE/BBH here right now. They are always in demand


[20-Apr-22 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saxil**:	I see, I picked the food starter and figured there was no way I would pick the right planet to start on so here I am.


[20-Apr-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yea Montem isn't great for food with it's low fertility and low concentration of water

**Dipster**:	you could just keep the food processor to feed your own pioneers and build more farms + incinerators


[20-Apr-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	it's not water intensive, and even if it were water is almost the same price H2O.NC1 H2O.IC1


[20-Apr-22 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	the soil fertility penalty here is only -6% and the bonus there is less than +20% iirc


[20-Apr-22 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	but C.NC1 sells much better than C.IC1


[20-Apr-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	making BSE without your own supply of C/FE is getting less profitable by the day, BSE has hit market maker price yet FE and C continue to rise


[20-Apr-22 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-22 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	I've got a few RATs headed to Montem in about 36 hrs, and likely more on the way. In an effort to live up to my company name, "Fed Universe: Cause to be Kind," I'll be offering RATs for a significantly reduced price to players just joining. For right now I'm limiting it to 75 RATs per player, at a price of 100 NCC /ea. (Might change in the coming days depending on demand.) Post a buy ad on the Montem Local Market, and DM me, and I'll grab it as soon as I'm able! (irl responsibilites are a little chaotic rn)


[20-Apr-22 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	i find it just a little suspect that you omit that you bought and relisted all the RAT and that the stable price for RAT over the past 180d has been mid-60s, not 100


[20-Apr-22 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	my econ is fully functioning according to the principles of juche so it's no skin off my back but just so people know, fair price for RAT is 60-70 tops, type CXPC RAT.NC1 and click 180d to see for yourself

[21-Apr-22 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	if you're going to park all your capital in a market manipulation play instead of investing it productively you should at least target something that takes longer than a day to spin up a supply chain for smh

**Ephemarel**:	@Dipster *gasp* Sus? Me? Inconceivable!


[21-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Nah, Dipster is right tho. For all the newbies joining, typing RAT.NC1 into a chat gives you a quick look at the last price RAT was sold at on the respective cx (exchange), and thus a good idea of what the demand is. Given the massive influx of players, several players preempted the accompanying high demand, as he said, and are attempting to profit off of it. (I largely did not participate in this, and simply held off on selling what I've produced the last couple weeks instead.)


[21-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	It would indeed be a smart move for most players to hold out or produce some RATs themselves rather than pay the high prices in MOR right now, but for newbies with so little capital to throw around right now (esp on Montem where it doesn't make sense to use all of their starting money on food machinery), they have less options.

**AmAnBear**:	They want people to hire WAR not to use the CX


[22-Apr-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwinGs**:	but it's not like anybody gets the money paid to the WAR though.  and if somebody so wishes to pay a premium to buy a good that they need, isn't that their prerogative?


[22-Apr-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	Its just discouraged. Besides money sinks are needed to prevent hyper inflation. Well at least as much as MM caps don't stop it


[22-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmAnBear**:	tho i dunno if WARs are actually good money sinks

**TwinGs**:	well CUO has no buy MM so it can't be used as a money sink, and if i remove my stock there is none for people to buy at this time (albeit at a premium) and someone else can come in and overprice their own stock...so i'm not sure why i can't just leave that there?

[22-Apr-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Hmm


[22-Apr-22 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	especially with montem flipping chem in recent history, it’s a great way to have both here near MOR


[22-Apr-22 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	We just built an infirmary to get the settler pop up, a lot of people running PP2s and AL


[22-Apr-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I was looking at PP2's.. does it pay well enough?


[22-Apr-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	the efficiency would be excellent though


[22-Apr-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I run an all PP2 base there, and it’s been wonderful


[22-Apr-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	4-6 hour constant hops and no more orbitals to deal with


[22-Apr-22 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	the orbitals are annoying lol


[22-Apr-22 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	do you run a 500 base or add more permits?


[22-Apr-22 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xitek**:	i was looking at lfabs but not sure there's enough demand for it?


[22-Apr-22 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	maybe in a few weeks it picks up as these new players start to expand


[22-Apr-22 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Yeah. I’ve been loving it for permit expansions too


[22-Apr-22 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that and repairing my settler bases


[22-Apr-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	We also have plans to support PP3s there


[22-Apr-22 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I cannot move my construction to a planet without techs


[23-Apr-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I think LSE and LTA will increase in demand as HBBs get more popular too


[23-Apr-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but if you're using PP2s, it might work


[23-Apr-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	though I think it also has a settler shortage


[23-Apr-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	techs are on the roadmap for Danakil


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	we just pumped a huge settler campaign last week


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I mean I might get what I need at popr


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but maybe not


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I'll have a hard time dismantling mine for now.. i have 4 experts so it goes pretty good even with chem on


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I only employ settlers there


[23-Apr-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	here*


[23-Apr-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	for sure. It won’t be an overnight shift


[23-Apr-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mostly do food processing and metallurgy there


[23-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I’m sure there will be plenty of people to buy those goods with the new players too


[23-Apr-22 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	anything to increase local sales is always good


[23-Apr-22 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I doubt new players will buy GIN and WIN


[23-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Danakil just kind of became my "overflow" planet where all the things I didn't know where to put went


[23-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Then I built an ORC


[23-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Oh damn. Those are some high end goods


[23-Apr-22 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	except, it feels like the idea that fertility doesn't matter because it overproduces was true before they fixed popi


[23-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I also make KOM and ALE


[23-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so getting a tech population established there would be really good


[23-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	good to know


[23-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Not for me really


[23-Apr-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have no plans on employing anything other than settlers


[23-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I mean then you have people to buy the ALE and whatnot


[23-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah, yeah that


[23-Apr-22 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	however you just need 1 month, and you gain acess to the LM for life


[24-Apr-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if you do not renew PRO (there is no auto renew either) it expires into BASIC, you cant post on the LM but you can still accept from it

**mRicci**:	nice thats good to know, thanks


[24-Apr-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mRicci**:	yeah i'll prob do that, send one on the way already so its basically empty but have one with an empty hull


[24-Apr-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mRicci**:	sent*


[24-Apr-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there are times where you will have to fly long distances empty. Like my base on EM-929b, I have to export over 2x my imports. So for every full ship leaving there 1 ship has to arrive with 50% (or completly empty if 1 ship was completely full)


[24-Apr-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	So I pay the same amount for a round trip regardless of how full the ships are


[24-Apr-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	(around 4k a day if you do a half decent burn)

**shadowsneak**:	hello!


[25-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Just joined with a friend to try this out


[25-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Looks alright so far, just not much to do on day 1


[25-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	set up your base, create buildings, start production, send a ship to the CX for more goods, thats the bulk of it


[25-Apr-22 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah done all that hehe


[25-Apr-22 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	besides that, looking at recipes, planning, and talking in chat is like 95% of the experience


[25-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the start of the game is quite slow


[25-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Is there any easy way to see what items are in demand on our planet? e.g. whats worth producing?


[25-Apr-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	There is a Local Market for pro and basic accounts, otherwise looking through the volumes at MOR station is the best way to do it


[25-Apr-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	is it possible to be self sufficient production wise, or the planet constructs dont allow it


[25-Apr-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	depends on what you're making


[25-Apr-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	on this planet you can be fully self sufficient with DW, RAT, COF, BSE, BBH


[25-Apr-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	for OVE, PWO, BTA, BDE you need to import hydrogen for PE


[25-Apr-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	just because you can be self sufficient doesn't mean it's a good idea, you need to consider operating costs and opportunity cost (what if I sell these materials instead of using them as inputs for myself)


[25-Apr-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	but for heavy/bulky stuff that's hard to transport it's usually a good tradeoff


[25-Apr-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Im a Carbon farmer, but im hoping that despite lack of production benefits, there would be higher costs for my products at a place like here? not sure if that logic works


[25-Apr-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	yeah carbon is always in demand as an input for smelting iron


[25-Apr-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah I noticed that people will probably like smelting here alot


[25-Apr-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	the benefits of soil fertility are not anywhere near as big as you might think, and even if they were, you can just build hydroponics, which this planet is perfect for because it has water and limestone which is turned into nutrient solution


[25-Apr-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	ok cheers


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Im definitely looking to extra water if I can so I dont need to go and buy it


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	extract*


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	I haven't done the math recently but you might be better off just buying water until you get into hydroponics


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	I cant find carbon in any of the tabs at the station to check prices


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	building a rig to extract water is going to be extremely expensive right now with inflated building fab prices


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	I swear ive checked every tab haha


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	it's Elements C.NC1


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	ok thanks


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah I imagine everything is expensive with the influx of steam users


[25-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	100 H20.NC1 is only like 3,300 and will last you a week or more with only a couple farms unless you're doing the more water intensive recipes


[25-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	H2O.NC1 *


[25-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	There is generally a decent demand for C on montem, as there are also many chemists who use C For their inputs here too


[25-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	whereas a rig costs 18,000 and will take a long time to recoup most likely


[25-Apr-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	so if supply is only half of demand, why aren't prices higher?


[25-Apr-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	so maybe i just build more farms and incinerators then


[25-Apr-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	A lot of C is produced and consumed locally on the planets since it is heavy to transport


[25-Apr-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah as a trial user i dont have the luxury of local sales


[25-Apr-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Ill just work on producing carbon then, and keep buying the other stuff


[25-Apr-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if you want to buy less water to crow crops, people grow MAI instead of GRN


[25-Apr-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but be aware that it takes longer to grow


[25-Apr-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	ah ok


[25-Apr-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	I realised I did beans before I knew what i was doing


[25-Apr-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	but i dont want to cancel and lose the whole 1 unit of water this early


[25-Apr-22 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	1 unit of water is a small price to pay imo, but up to you


[25-Apr-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah i see its 1:3 vs 1:4, I guess it all adds up


[25-Apr-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	With the time it takes to grow these things, it’s the opportunity cost of not producing the correct goods that hurts the most


[25-Apr-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	since it uses the other consumables still


[25-Apr-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	yeah that makes sense


[25-Apr-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	to SIO to Montem, thats a terrible idea, there is cheap SIO on Prism, a planet just a few jumps away


[25-Apr-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Thank you, i did not notice Prism before. So i could buy SIO there on the local market then?


[25-Apr-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah but buy it before you fly out


[25-Apr-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I don't see any open sell orders on the LM


[25-Apr-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if you fly first and buy later your ship might be stuck waiting there days until somebody grabs your ad


[25-Apr-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Yeah its not that newbies got much to do, my ships are idle in Vallis and Mortem too. Capital is moving slow in the beginning and cargo holds are not being filled. I take delivery contracts to offset fuel costs.


[25-Apr-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah true


[25-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	it would be cool to have an investment opportunities for veterans on newbies. Say you establish a contract that a newbie needs to expand to 4 mining rights by day 7, and provide him either mats or money.

**Rubicate**:	I've done that many times before :)


[25-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Newbie would lock his current base as a security deposit, i think its valued at 120k without the ships


[25-Apr-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's how I made a lot of friends here


[25-Apr-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	yeah but i mean by actual ingame mechanic


[25-Apr-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah


[25-Apr-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	hmm


[25-Apr-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i still like the idea of loaning out ships as collatera


[25-Apr-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	right now you do it with just an agreement, so if i quit tomorrow, you technically lose your investment. But with ingame mechanic my current base could be sold/dissasembled and you get % back


[25-Apr-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	most new players under use their 2nd ship for the first 3 weeks


[25-Apr-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Share some tips on how not to :)


[25-Apr-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	shipping contracts 1000%


[25-Apr-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Yeah im doing that, but theres not always a good offer on the table.


[25-Apr-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	look on the Local Market on the planet and at MOR as well


[25-Apr-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the other good thing to do is reach out to big players and see if they need help shipping


[25-Apr-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	whats the expected lifetime of a newbie ship?


[25-Apr-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	2 months?


[25-Apr-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	forever as long as you repair it


[25-Apr-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i only built my 1st new ship 380 days in


[25-Apr-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	yeah i already complained that ships should be more accessible, if this game wants to attract more players, even for a niche.


[25-Apr-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	in that time you can drive a titan in eve


[25-Apr-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	more or less


[25-Apr-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the universe wasnt advanced enough to build FTL ships for the first 8 months


[25-Apr-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so its not so much an accessibility problem as a tech tree problem


[25-Apr-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	NPC's should cover that gap in game tbh, and then gradually retreat from the market


[25-Apr-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	there has to be a market maker initially


[25-Apr-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	STL ships are only about 550k, so thats attainable in about 90 days


[25-Apr-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	several people prioritize them over a 4th or 5th base


[25-Apr-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	On that topic. Gonna leave for MOR exchange in 2h30', basicly empty. Still got 480m³ & 480t of space


[25-Apr-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Leaving Vallis for Morten now, got 128t empty, if anyone needs something shipped


[25-Apr-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	got two packages for Grey Water


[25-Apr-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Grey Water is something we called dirty water that was used in washing/bathroom in the aircraft.


[25-Apr-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	real life story


[25-Apr-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Your cargo is being loaded, kind sir.


[25-Apr-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Departed. 20h 3m.


[25-Apr-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	holy slow burn


[25-Apr-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	ooof that traffic in Montem in EU evening time. It was dead empty in the morning, now theres so many blimps on the sector map


[25-Apr-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the planets are even close to eachother too


[25-Apr-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	vallis>montem should be less than 6 hours right now


[25-Apr-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Yeah Montem is getting closer to Vallis, will be like that for a abit


[25-Apr-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah, 4 hrs on 155 units is real nice


[25-Apr-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	i jack the fuel consumption to minimum most of times, because i dont get to use ships that much, they have some downtime, especially in the EU mornings.


[25-Apr-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the planets only get this close every 3 weeks


[25-Apr-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	but i will start planning to have them ready for prime times, seems its the time to get shipping contracts


[25-Apr-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	just a heads up, its good to take advantage so you can get multiple trips in a day


[25-Apr-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Understood.


[25-Apr-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	I have a ship empty at Mortem and can send it either Station or Vallis. If someone has good cargo and a reasonable offer, i can haul it for you.

[25-Apr-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Pays to have cash haha


[25-Apr-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	is he paying you to run PR or are you another alt


[25-Apr-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Ultimately I mean its his prerogative and they are free markets


[25-Apr-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	if he has the means


[25-Apr-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	just like in real life, da epic invisible hand of market manipulation provides perfect efficiency to all


[25-Apr-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Usually fair enough, but doing it when you know a bunch of new players are joining that you'll be making use of. That is a bit too far imo


[25-Apr-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	ya the morality of it could be in question


[25-Apr-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	haha


[25-Apr-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	But i mean.. we also doubled our taxes here on mont at the same time


[25-Apr-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	double.


[25-Apr-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Well, there are 2.5x as much bases.... That upkeep is gotta be paid by someone


[25-Apr-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	its to scale though


[25-Apr-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	2.5x bases is 2.5x transactions is 2.5x tax revenue


[25-Apr-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	generally speaking


[25-Apr-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	and I held back supply of bfabs, and bought up metals up to the 20th, then took it to market after


[25-Apr-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	not much different the the RAT move


[25-Apr-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I just have a significantly smaller reach of influence.  Many of us did it though

[25-Apr-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	my second shuttle can take some stuff up, im going to learn how to fill these orders


[25-Apr-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	Is there an easy way to check such orders?


[25-Apr-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	I can see the price of goods at Moria Station, but I cant see any requests from this planet for goods to be transported there


[25-Apr-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	If its at the local market I cant access it can I since im a trial user?


[25-Apr-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	well, I can see the orders, just not sure if i hit accept that it will be as simple as drag and drop


[25-Apr-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Jornix**:	i know i cant put up new jobs, but wasnt sure if i could accept current orders


[25-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	to the best of my knowledge no


[25-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	if you have basic you can accept


[25-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	with pro you can post


[25-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	i might get pro once


[25-Apr-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	i will have basic forever after that is my understanding


[25-Apr-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	if you have the means its certainly a fair price for the value


[25-Apr-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	highly recommend


[25-Apr-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	reoccurring orders alone is worth it lol


[25-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	i need to find a voucher code.....lol


[25-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	ok done


[25-Apr-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	so if you need stuff sent to the station, i can probably now assist!


[25-Apr-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	I should also be able to make a corporation on the planet now too, unless you have one or know of a good one to join


[25-Apr-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Checking on Discord probably the best place for that


[25-Apr-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	or honestly just wait on it as you are here longer you will meet people


[25-Apr-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jornix**:	will this planet ever be full, or do starting planets have some kind of unlimited spaces


[25-Apr-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	ya so


[25-Apr-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	the starter planets have 'ghost plots' to make sure new players joining can still find a home


[25-Apr-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	but current players cant start a base on those planets


[25-Apr-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	they are called ghost plots and you can see them on the PLI


[25-Apr-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	so montem has +508 ghost plots


[25-Apr-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	or 508 surplus bases


[25-Apr-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

***EchoThePossum** joined.*


[26-Apr-22 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	you can extract the H2O from the planet too


[26-Apr-22 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	saves money to extract because you won't be paying for fuel


[26-Apr-22 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	using a base planner it looks like i would need a crazy amount of RIG


[26-Apr-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	although i suppose it depends on how much consumables they consume per day per rig....


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	one FP with H2O -> DW takes 100 H2O/day according to this D:


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	yea i mean this planet isn't exactly rich in water


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Keep in ind you dont have to do everything


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	yeah true, it seems to just be better to import either the DW or H2O instead


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I have many of one building


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Buy the DW


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	unless you are making it to sell it, in which case hat wouldnt be on this planet


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	that*


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	nah, just trying to be as efficient as possible


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	efficient would be importing it


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	yup yup ty


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-Blank-**:	@PMRV im looking for a steady supply of it. I currently am still setting up my stuff so i wont have to much money for a little while but once i start producing more il be able to buy more


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	it looks like the best nearest place to obtain water is XH-083


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	specifically XH-083c


[26-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	really high water concentration but its also like 3 systems away


[26-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	er 4


[26-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sp1r17**:	yikes


[26-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	that or DW-739 which is only 1 but has a lesser abundancy


[26-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	XH-083 is like 90% and DW-739 is like 50%


[26-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pengo1998**:	so if you really want your own source of DW DW-739 would be best bet

[27-Apr-22 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PauloAce**:	definitely going to invest in pro soon then xD


[27-Apr-22 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	honestly, play for a full week, not making all the mistakes and learning from them plus how the game works. then you can restart after and see if you still want to get pro license


[27-Apr-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	also, do plan before you restart (if you are going to). starting with a plan is a big advantage.

[27-Apr-22 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	but do note its not necessary to buy pro, you can get a good few months of gameplay before you hit what i would say is the limitation... and no not the LM at all no... the limitation would be the HQ level being capped at 5 for trial players


[27-Apr-22 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	This COGC vote is literally a great example of how short term planning and inability to cooperate leads to losses for everyone. Prisoners dilemma if you will.


[27-Apr-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Everyone knows they'll be better suited long run individually by a specialised COGC. But they're concerned that short term it might impact them negativity so vote for continuity.


[27-Apr-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Montem should be CHEM or CONS, PIO is a bad choice that just reduces the efficiency and therefore productivity and profit of all of NEO space.


[27-Apr-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Thank you for the wise words Bobemor <3


[27-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if more people voted for CONS, I would willingly throw my 300 pioneers to vote that because why not... but idts CHEM would be a good idea with all these new players


[27-Apr-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	maybe next week we will see construction and chem at the top of the list


[27-Apr-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Everybody should vote for what they think is the best for themselves and Montem, but I do agree that specialization is a powerful option. Consider carefully


[27-Apr-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	CHEM with Danakil as CONS makes huge sense for Neo as a region and huge sense for new players.


[27-Apr-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	The thing people overlook is that COGCs speed up input consumption. Whilst often decreasing input production if moving to specialised. This drives up price.


[27-Apr-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	People selling LST on Montem won't be voting for PIO or RES, they'll be voting for something that using their inputs (like CHEM) as that leads to the most profit for them.


[27-Apr-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Interesting point you make - I almost wonder if the 10% increase from a non specialized COGC is worth less in increased quantity produced (which also drops the value) than you'd get from 25% on a specific industry that uses you as an input


[27-Apr-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	As other industries consume more LST and less is produced, prices will naturally rise too


[27-Apr-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Just look at Vallis - FEO went through the roof rather quickly as soon as it switched to metallurgy


[27-Apr-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	both chem and const would drife this


[27-Apr-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Some people could counter this by saying its bad for CHEM users then. However, they're now producing far more much more efficiently. The total output of 25% is higher than 10% ultimately. Growth in PrUn is measured by productivity ultimately.


[27-Apr-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Also Chem consumable cost is much higher

[27-Apr-22 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Captain consistant single-hop travel times


[27-Apr-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Yeah @Captain there's lots of shipping and advanced pops are on the way - I just took gov last week and paid out of pocket for a ADM and WAR in addition to almost half a mil of starup capital to refil Popi buildings


[27-Apr-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	It is being *heavily* invested in


[27-Apr-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	I will once again call the voters of montem COGC to consider specializing! Specializing into chem or construction reinforces the need for LST and will help maintain good prices for those extractors that give up the PIO bonus. The 25% bonus into an industry really helps push the planet forward


[03-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I still don't get the PIO proponets, is it just inertia or is there a positive argument that i'm missing?


[03-May-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	As a LST extractor I'm voting Chemistry as I have an active interest in high LST prices.


[03-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	construction never beats chemistry, I have no chemistry, therefore I'm forced to vote PIO


[03-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	The only people i can understand voting Pioneer is people who are farming or something strange like that maybe?


[03-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	LST prices have quadrupled in the past 2 weeks, how much more subsidy do you people need


[03-May-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Dipster so you vote construction early to indicate your preference then change later if it needs?


[03-May-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	more or less


[03-May-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Interesting strategy, i can understand that somewhat more, but it does seem rather short term.


[03-May-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	the choice for me is not 10% vs 25%, it's 0% vs 10%


[03-May-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Yeah, but that's not quite how the choice works out. Since really its all about profitability and overall production.

**Dipster**:	I consume 100% of my own LST production, I don't produce any surplus for export, if anything my interests are aligned with lower LST prices


[03-May-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ahh so you've gone the full vertical set-up on one base and don't trade on the CX much?


[03-May-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Interesting, i had perhaps naively assumed most people around here used the CX a lot


[03-May-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	I correctly predicted that exposing myself to insane volatility from the Steam launch would be horrible for me


[03-May-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	It's seemed crazy profitable for everyone else in construction though :P


[03-May-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	would probably be bankrupt if I hadn't vertically integrated my own DW/RAT/LST/FE production


[03-May-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Perhaps focusing more on maximising total output and profitability could be good :P


[03-May-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	BSE and BBH have gone up so much that dw and rat price rises have been inconcequential


[03-May-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

**edpovi**:	I don't know the bonuses enough to know which I prefer.  New player with Constructor start.  The PIO perk seems a good general bump.  The PP1 from the starting package would benefit from Construction, but I have 2 experts there.  I don't have anything using Chemistry yet, and my next building is likely to be an EXT, when I can afford it.


[03-May-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myhre**:	The argument for voting chem is because with LST you can make FLX into FEO+C+O+FLX = FE ?


[03-May-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	or were?


[03-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... I guess FE, LST, and BSEs are about 25% cheaper than they were at start


[03-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a lot of other stuff is a lot cheaper


[03-May-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**edpovi**:	yeah, I was looking into what sort of Settler buildings I can grow into, an was going t look at CHEM, but didn't do the math yet


[03-May-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Specialisation is also often best for people indirectly. Chemistry is definitely slightly more niche than Construction, but that's partly its attraction, it does very good on Montem. Montem constructors will be out-competed by the now consistently Construction constructors on Danakil. Chemists here however, will be able to compete, but they'll compete even better with a COGC. Profitable industries also have wider reaching benefits, LST demand goes up, flx and ns goes down, also going to see more higher level pop demand which is always good.


[03-May-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	i would vote construction if it was available, but same for me as a new player the current choice is 0% or 10% so i chose 10%


[03-May-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I won't be outcompeted by constructors on Danakil


[03-May-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Because Danakil has no advanced workers


[03-May-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	For now, I'll do PP2/3 on Dana.  Leaving my PP1's here.  The %10 pio bonus+ proximity to FE and LST make


[03-May-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Dana will be a %100 construction focused planet no doubt about it


[03-May-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	I thought about flipping to chem here


[03-May-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Noverus**:	Ok, Danakil looks nice to move to eventually for construction, yeah, but I need to get a better footing before I consider shifting everything around. I'm also looking at expanding to a farm world to help offset some of my upkeep costs, and I think that may be a better move for me first.


[03-May-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	But, either of those would be .... at least a couple weeks away.


[03-May-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Well its certainly not a bad idea to have a source of RAT and/or DW


[03-May-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	depending what you run now


[03-May-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Doing Construction mats right now.


[03-May-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Once I get more $ built up I figure I can start self-producing some of the mats to expand, and then sell off the rest when I'm not actively expanding.


[03-May-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	running PP1's also?  Or doing FE and LST/


[03-May-22 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Have 1 PP1 and pulling FE / LST right now.


[03-May-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	LST and FE prices really strong right now


[03-May-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	PP1's wont be as attractive soon, already actually


[03-May-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	One thing I learned in the early days was be flexible and not afraid to pivot


[03-May-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Yep. I'm looking at moving to farming (different planet, of course).


[03-May-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	But, I'll ride the construction mat frenzy for a bit to help bankroll the new venture.


[03-May-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Yep good idea


[03-May-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	There is a few factors there.  Shipping is a big one


[03-May-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	How much time you want to spend managing as well


[03-May-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	Funny enough I wanted to start this game doing mostly shipping and logistics lol.


[03-May-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	You definitely could and some do


[03-May-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	But, i figured making my own raw mats to make PP1 items is better in the long run so my actual material costs are just settler needs.


[03-May-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Theres nothing wrong with that approach.  When i first got into construction I did as well


[03-May-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	Figured i was gonna build just one more extractor to have one getting LST and the other FE, but slow process in making money.


[03-May-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	I figure I should cash out the non NCC cash i have to fund more local expansion, but still figuring a bit out overall.


[03-May-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	If your good at sourcing the inputs and stay on top of it then it makes sense to dump the extractors/SME


[03-May-22 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	but if your not then having your own supply is ideal otherwise you will get wrecked by volatility


[03-May-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	most of my time is spent sourcing mats and logistics, not as much base planning as first


[03-May-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	Other frontiers I still have to explore are whatever the earlier conversation was about voting, and then Corporation stuff.


[03-May-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	thats just noise until your makin bank imo


[03-May-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	Yeah, I had lots of luck earlier today with shipping, picking up tons of contracts to not waste space planet side to station, but seems that's done for the day.


[03-May-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Ya you grabbed a bunch of mine, ty


[03-May-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	quick deliveries too


[03-May-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Man, there was a 12k shipping one that my corp rating wasn't high enough for. Figured I'd make 5k after paying fuel round trip.


[03-May-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Who had it listed?  Reach out to them


[03-May-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xitek**:	so slow at first


[03-May-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Significant


[03-May-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	This one is probably the closest I've found, and I've been looking for years.


[03-May-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xitek**:	Btw.. I'll buy all your FE and LST on planet if you want


[03-May-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Oh, yeah, getting that set up was the smartest thing I did.


[03-May-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xitek**:	Moving forward though. If you ever have any to sell I will buy it all


[03-May-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	Sounds good.


[03-May-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	I've got 29 LST I can sell right now. I'm short on FE though, it's still cooking.


[03-May-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SplitLogistix**:	I do remember my first attempt at this game, eventually you get reset due to inactivity.  How long does that usually take?  I imagine a bunch of steam users didn't care for this game and are just taking up space right now.


[03-May-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**armorlord**:	our taxes got jacked so high for us to be rednecks? why, I sense some tea is about to be thrown into an ocean of liquid slag


[04-May-22 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Apparently planets are expensive to run


[04-May-22 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean they were even before the new player wave


[04-May-22 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	can we propose for a change... pioneers be slightly lower taxed than settlers? idk just wanted to throw something out here


[04-May-22 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	and also why are we still not specializing in smth for the CoGC


[04-May-22 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The pioneers are the thing that's costing us the most


[04-May-22 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	if you consider that they're getting the CoGC bonus


[04-May-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	;-; sed 10% pioneer bonus vs possible 25% construction bonus


[04-May-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	I'm not even doing construction here I'm just mining LST with 300 pio... and i don't understand why we ain't specializing


[04-May-22 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	inertia


[04-May-22 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	people doing all sorts of non-construction things


[04-May-22 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I imagine we still have some people doing agriculture


[04-May-22 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	true but with the LST here and FEO... surely a good number are doing construction


[04-May-22 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Yeah, but construction using Pioneers :P


[04-May-22 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	The open market for the higher tiers is still pretty poor


[04-May-22 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	no not really


[04-May-22 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Especially considering how hard it still is getting AL for some reason


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	if we use pioneer CoGC it will only be 10%... if we do construction CoGC it will be 25% to construction


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'd say the open market is pretty good for the higher tiers


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ABH.NC1


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ASE.NC1


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	might take a bit to sell


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Sure, but that's PP4 :D


[04-May-22 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	RBH.NC1


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	construction includes Prefab Plant MK1 (PP1), Welding Plant (WEL), Prefab Plant MK2 (PP2), Unit Prefab Plant (UPF), Prefab Plant MK3 (PP3), Prefab Plant MK4 (PP4)


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	RDE.NC1


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	those prices are insane compared to my earlier spreadsheet


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	granted, I haven't really updated it


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and EPO.NC1 seems to have taken off


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	... 125


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	jesus


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	it has been like that for a while


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	quite a long while at that


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think my sheet estimated EPO at 50


[04-May-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	yeah


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Yeah, I've been looking into EPO, pretty nice


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, I saw it at like 80 a few weeks ago


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm halfway tempted to make another EPO base


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	EPO at 50 was at least 2-3 months ago iirc


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean my sheet just calculated it based on the PG price


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	looking at the price chart... 50 is more than 3 months ago


[04-May-22 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it always sold for more than that


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but not like a whole lot more


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	yea true


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the sheet basically tried to estimate things there wasn't a real market for by pricing building time based on things that were actually selling


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	waay back in the day when I first considered an AML


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	I'm glad I'm not the only one with crazy spreadsheets :P


[04-May-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I was trying to price out PP4 time at a time when lfabs were not selling super often


[04-May-22 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	i got a stack of 500 EPO i bought who knows how long ago which is valued at purchase price of 58/u


[04-May-22 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So I bascially had to derive a shole bunch of prices


[04-May-22 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	But even then, the RoI on bfabs is kind of the best still :D


[04-May-22 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	EPO is still massively overpriced at 125


[04-May-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Yeah. But then you're stuck with a POL that can't really make anything profitably ATM other than EPO :D


[04-May-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Even adding a LST extractor will give me better RoI


[04-May-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	And that helps with logistics, rather than complicating them :D


[04-May-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh, lol, CL prices were 450 on my sheet


[04-May-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	lol


[04-May-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I remember once upon a time CL was the waste product and NA was the valuable thing


[04-May-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	It would be interesting if "storing" stuff in a CX wasn't free :P


[04-May-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Ooh, i probably need to fix H and C prices too


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean the POLs make decent money making PG


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My estimate of 95 as the EPO price is based on a base day of POL time being worth 2300


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	making PG


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's actually really good for how small and light on workers they are, I think?


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well


[04-May-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	2300 before upkeep and consumables and taxes


[04-May-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but still


[04-May-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	PG production is decent, but it seems it's hard to get MG


[04-May-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	While MGS production is really profitable, MG is broken :D


[04-May-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	PRUNer claims my Kiruna base makes 46k per day

[04-May-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	MG.NC1 is cheaper than it used to be and freely available


[04-May-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	on the CX


[04-May-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I used to run 11 (I think?) POLs making PG on a planet


[04-May-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and 3 more on Montem and I just bought MG


[04-May-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	But it's still more profitable to make even PE, and that's not a good RoI in a BMP right now :D


[04-May-22 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	A lot of that might have to do with the influx of new players, though basic stuff is of course always useful anyway


[04-May-22 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I can't see how


[04-May-22 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	POLs have 15.8 ROI on PG supposedly


[04-May-22 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	oh, 12.1 on the PE


[04-May-22 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but still 3x as many workers


[04-May-22 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You can't run nearly as many BMPs on a planet


[04-May-22 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	True, POLs get more worthwhile in the long run


[04-May-22 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	The startup costs are relatively high, but they're also relatively cheap to run


[04-May-22 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	RoI isn't the only thing we should be thinking about :D


[04-May-22 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	It's really useful in the "exponential growth" part, but if you already have an empire...


[04-May-22 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also PG compacts down H


[04-May-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	while PE has the same volume as the H that went into it


[04-May-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which is super relevant for me for now


[04-May-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well, less so


[04-May-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It was super relevant when my PG was made 4 jumps away


[04-May-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but now I make PE and turn it into BDEs


[04-May-22 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might even sell some someday


[04-May-22 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I had some listed but then I had to yoink them for my latest repairs


[04-May-22 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My Verdant base came up for repairs and slight remodeling


[04-May-22 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess not quite all going to Verdant


[04-May-22 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but still a lot of RIGs overdue for repairs and a couple COLs to build


[04-May-22 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and all the FPs


[04-May-22 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Yeah, shipping... how many ships do you have? :D

***plweoejnfn334** left.*


[04-May-22 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**IDKanything**:	its just because you're only looking at MOR region


[04-May-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Antares is the only other one worth considering.


[04-May-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	...why don't you compare FE & AL prices in ANT vs MOR and see whats the pattern


[04-May-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Yeah that i know, but all other CX are dead due to low player count. And i cant believe there are no profitable AL planets closer to MOR than Antares. Not starting location


[04-May-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**edpovi**:	I'm new and started with Constructor package, but I don't see the benefit of that Program yet.  I only have one PP1 along with the BMP which doesn't get a bonus from Construction.  PIO gives a boost to everything I do at the moment and for the foreseeable next couple of weeks.

**edpovi**:	I was looking at PP2 ( and other settler buildings) and the main issue I see is that AL isn't well sourced at Montem, and they seem to make the same parts as the PP1.


[04-May-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yeah. I run PP1 here, PP2 on Berthier.


[04-May-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	But you could run both PP1 and PP2 here too and shuttle the AL?ALO from elsewhere - depends on how you want to set things up

**CapitanIncognito**:	I think it's weird that the constructor package recommends a BMP honestly


[04-May-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**edpovi**:	I don't think its all that odd, the BMP does make MCG, a firm part of Base Construction.  But I see your point as it doesn't benefit from the construction CoGC


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, plus on some planets making MCG is extra hard


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Not here


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but for example my first start was on Antares and getting LST was impossible


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so any MCG I made just meant fewer BSEs


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I COLIQed that company in like one day


[04-May-22 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**edpovi**:	I plan to make an EXT for LST, it seems a decent use of the "extra" 20 PIO I have eating all the RAT and drinking COF while playing computer games....

**IDKanything**:	If Capacity is smaller than Required, the efficiency of all Production Lines requiring the respective type of workforce is impacted negatively. More precisely, the efficiency is multiplied with the percentage of workers available, i.e.: Efficiency x (Population Size / Required)


[04-May-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**edpovi**:	Yeah, I noticed that. Would be great to use *exactly* the 20 spare workers I have at the moment..  Need to build another HB1 and PP1 to be closer to the correct balance...

[06-May-22 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	haha, I'm sorry the taxes hasn't been lowered yet, it's taking a bit longer than estimated because the CoGC's upkeep suddently increased as well. CoGC+Popi needed 5000 DW just this 10 day period. It's crazy. That's creeping towards to half a million NCC just to buy DW for the planet.


[06-May-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	(I think the new player wave is expensive for all planets as they pay very little taxes being so new but still count as 1 full base for CoGC purposes)

**IDKanything**:	doesn't it basically pause the time ticking down until you continue production again


[06-May-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I would guess it's just total hours run in those buildings, so stopping it would just not continue to add to that until it started up again

[06-May-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Comrade_Romanov**:	Im gonna be sharing my first time experiences here regarding gameplay, since this chat is slightly slower than global


[08-May-22 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	the game momentum has doubled with the construction of the second factory. I can image whats going on when you have 40+


[08-May-22 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	its probably almost real time strategy then :D


[08-May-22 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Comrade_Romanov**:	Although i still believe early game for new comers is too slow, it needs to be sped up, by either giving them more factories or accellerating production of tier 1 stuff, so they actually got something to do in the first 2-3 days too


[08-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You couldn't really speed up tier 1 stuff without making a lot of it worthless


[08-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I think the game does a terrible job of teaching you that your starting package is more of a suggestion


[08-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like you can sell everything and build something completely different


[08-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or at least sell the fuel and combine that with your starter cash


[08-May-22 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess it was actually better right before Steam launch


[08-May-22 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	bfabs were selling for about half before launch


[08-May-22 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so that 30-40k you start with would have gone a lot further


[08-May-22 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IDKanything**:	only BSE was half the price, BBH and BDE only rose by a few 100s... the starting cash was still enough to cover another HB1 and production building above what the recommended ones are so not that diff than before the launch besides 2-3 more days of scraping by.

[11-May-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Well, really, all I need from the POL is the PG production. I'd almost rather have a standing trade agreement with someone to process MG and just get paid in PG. Maybe that new contract system will give players some options with that?


[11-May-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah should be possible with the new contract system


[11-May-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	with the prices of each, thats not really a sustainable trade deal


[11-May-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its about 2:1 MG:PG on a cost bais


[11-May-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	Forgive me if I am mistaken, but it seems in my limited experience that pioneer industries (or even construction alone) are far more substantial than chemistry, and dedicating one of the largest starter planets (that is pretty well suited for b-fabs) to chemistry hurts new players and increases b-fab prices


[11-May-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-May-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	and by improve I mean decrease the price to more reasonable levels


[11-May-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, some of those recipes look really profitable because it's not worth it to run your own facility just to make a few that you need for some specific reason


[11-May-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

I dont think you can ever be 100% sekf sufficient,  otherwise what is the point of the game. Gets pretty boring if everyone making great profits and nobody buying but everybody selling.

**Lib**:	If I were to buy the same amount at the CX and make a trip exclusively for that I'd be paying approx 1600 ncc for fuel (74 stl times two for a return trip at 11 NCC pp)


[12-May-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Farrent**:	thanks


[16-May-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MajesticDefalt**:	:)


[16-May-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	Out of curiosity, how many of us voting pio in the cogc would vote construction if chemistry wasn't such a big threat?


[16-May-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	I know I would be


[16-May-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	I'm thinking of voting construction next round, and if it doesn't get momentum I'll switch back to pio


[16-May-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MajesticDefalt**:	I actually really like that idea, maybe i'm biased since i literally just built a prefab plant, but it would lower the costs at least a little


[16-May-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	haha I'm very biased but isn't that the point. I almost don't believe the figures the planner is telling me, apparently i'd get a 46% profit increase over pio as I run all PP1s (when i get 5 experts)


[16-May-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	obviously its more nuanced than that, as pio benefits my input cost, but still


[16-May-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Redemptionist**:	Did you account for the increased material costs it'd bring?


[16-May-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Redemptionist**:	LST is 100-120. If supply drops 10%, that def going up.


[16-May-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	Yeah exactly its more nuanced than that, the 46% is a best case figure, but I think the LST price would rise fairly reasonably, and constructors would still be better off as the factors are combined multiplicatively


[16-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	Its the same point the chemistry folk are making I believe, that even if the effect doesn't directly help you, it does indirectly, its just I think construction is more relevant for Montem than chemistry


[16-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	And I don't think danakil running construction alone is enough

**Bigtea47**:	What do you mean?


[16-May-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Well if you already bought it from the CX and were shipping it to the planet, I was going to let you use the MCG I have and then give me what you bought so it isn't just sitting around


[16-May-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	which is why I asked you about your price


[16-May-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**GreySith**:	Yeah I'm testing constructor to decide if i want to go back to being a metallurgist or not


[19-May-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	the starter pack is just what experts and free buildings you get


[19-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you can always change as you go


[19-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GreySith**:	Constructor is just really slow going


[19-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	take it from me, its faster growth than metallugy


[19-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	tho prices are a bit higher then when I first started on Vallis


[19-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**GreySith**:	Oh I played metallurgy for a year lol. It was my life


[19-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MajesticDefalt**:	do we know if a reset is going to happen again? what was the purpose of them when they happened


[19-May-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GreySith**:	They did them when people were reaching the end of what we could really do


[19-May-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GreySith**:	early on we didn't have nearly as much content


[19-May-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MajesticDefalt**:	Oh, so when things start getting stale, that makes sense, that plus the Steam rush is going to make a reset not happen soon


[19-May-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GreySith**:	Yeah he just told me that 1 or 2 days ago


[19-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

However, I didn't want all my things to be lost to the endless void, and have liquidated my assets for my brethren on Montem to enjoy. I would prefer the recipient to be less than 60 days old so I support a rising star, but I wont be picky. There is lots of money in store, ask me and I may assist you

**Elnor**:	chemistry need setlers CHP, POL and LAB has more uses than just NS and FLX


[25-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	every justification i've seen for chemistry cogc on montem is "LST is too heavy to export in bulk so we need to do chemistry here"


[25-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	and the only LST CHM recipes are FLX and NS, no one makes CA


[25-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	CHP*

[25-May-22 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	If y'all want to do chemistry here, fine. Then Chemistry taxes should be increased. Or the others decreased. The people who benefit from the CoGC should pay for the CoGC.

**armorlord**:	on avalon the food processing tax category is reduced to encourage planetary specialziation and COCG unity


[25-May-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I am obviously biased because I have 2 permits here and everything is chemistry


[25-May-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	but montem has great potential to produce chemistry products since it's not a common specialization and the proximity to the CX means limestone is not such a big pain to haul


[25-May-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I don't buy the FLX and NS argument. Maybe that's the gateway into chemistry, but it's not the reason everyone is voting for chemistry here.


[25-May-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I think it's just a bunch of people who have piggy-backed on the workforce that has been built up over time to access technicians and engineers to run AMLs or LABs


[25-May-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well the universe needs DDT, why not make it here too?


[25-May-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've got no problem with chemistry here on Montem.


[25-May-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I just think they should pay


[25-May-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	when it's PIO then it's equal for all low tier production


[25-May-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if we had a steady cogc I would pay more in taxes for it


[25-May-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sure. the problem is that taxes are not directly tied to what is voted for in the CoGC. So the governor has to intercede, and that takes a cycle to take effect.


[25-May-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	if not longer


[25-May-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	whatever - I will adjust accordingly. I prefer construction but nobody seems to want to vote for it wo I'll just vote pioneer. ain't no way I'm doing chemistry here.


[25-May-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	*so


[25-May-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so galvanize a construction vote, id rather see construction over pioneers, even if I dont personally benefit


[25-May-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats also part of the reason a lot of people are moving to danakil for construction, its been construction there reliably now for a month


[25-May-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I didn't know that. will consider it


[25-May-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fuyutsuki**:	It's getting to the point with my consumption that I need to take down the 6 BMPs on YI-280j making MG.NC1 and convert them into more EXTs


[28-May-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Ok, so COF is damn expensive. Is the ~10% efficiency I get from supplying it really worth it long term, or am I better served by well, not serving coffee to my pops?


[28-May-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myhre**:	You get more $ out of it than what you pay. I use PRUNner to do the mafs and it increase my profit from 20.8k to 23.4k


[28-May-22 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myhre**:	For 1100$ of COF I pay, I get 2.6k ( so more than double the ROI on COF alone )


[28-May-22 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	That's what, 3 COF?


[28-May-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myhre**:	2.3 to be exact :P


[28-May-22 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-May-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	There is more new players on montem that veterans. So most will vote for what they need which is pioneers.


[30-May-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	than*


[30-May-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sniff**:	I suspected as much. Thank you for the information.


[30-May-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	A bit more production for a new player goes a long way compared to little extra production for someone who has been there for a year.


[30-May-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Its a trade-off essentially. Higher efficiency on Chem stuff means that all inputs get more expensive as well. So could be that the price of inputs, say LST has a larger effect on profits compared to PIO CoGC. Also chem products become cheaper, so again, that also dripples down into the production lines of the newer guys


[30-May-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	I bet the dripple down effect works as good here as in real life. Not at all just makes the big bigger xD


[30-May-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	No, because there would be less liquidity for resources in this game compared to real life, that is if consistently the CoGC is flipped


[30-May-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	But paying plastics will get cheaper if we allow the people making them on montem make more profits doesnt seem based on reality either. If i look at chart for last 30 days and find where COGC has chem here. It axtually went up in price around that time last time.


[30-May-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	That's only because PG consumption has been going up


[30-May-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	the fact that prices are still this low is because of better production


[30-May-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	Sure, my point it id does nothing to the market prices just because a few people here make better margins.


[30-May-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	or PG prices are reflective of an increased C.NC1 price


[30-May-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I don't think there are enough POLs on Montem to drastically bring down the price of PG


[30-May-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	But either way, more people here want pioneers here. Most of them are newer players.


[30-May-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and most of their tax revenue is a pittance compared to what the COGC actually costs


[30-May-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	JS.


[30-May-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	my TECH + ENG buildings pay the tax of like 22 new players


[30-May-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Let's see, ENG @ 1080 means that one ENG building is worth 27 PIO ones


[30-May-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and I run 4 of them


[30-May-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	so my four buildings pays the equivalent tax of 108 PIO buildings which is like 12-14 bases


[30-May-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	We have 850 bases here. CHances are most are pio


[30-May-22 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I would say probably 85%+ are pure PIO


[30-May-22 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but this isn't a discussion about "what is the best social good." I thought we were talking about which COGC is best for the market locally here on the planet


[30-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	in which case, PIO seems to make the most sense (spreads it out the most) but CHEM is probably better if we can rotate new players into POLs


[30-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	It a hard subject to get right really. mor money from the majority also means they got money to spend on products.


[30-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	More money to higher producers, maybe products get cheaper


[30-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	well, everyone is paying taxes no matter what


[30-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	personally what I would want to see is the following:


[30-May-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Chem wins and taxes on Chem get 2X'd


[30-May-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	Plus i am new myself so i wont claim i know how it all works xD


[30-May-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	Im just assuming


[30-May-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	Everyone pays their taxes as production fees


[30-May-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	even if your chosen program didn't win


[30-May-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	Cant even imagine the taxes being payed on here.


[30-May-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	So many new people and many started here


[30-May-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	it's a large value but probably still not enough TBQH


[30-May-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	Just at first glance id say the taxes pay more than upkeep


[30-May-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	well, I'm about to build 4 more POLs


[30-May-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	and repair the ones I already have


[30-May-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	I'm going to take advantage of the high PG prices until they come back down


[30-May-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bigtea47**:	100 ncc a day per person seems like a reasonable ammount. 850 bases, That is 850k in the upkeep period.

**Konvolut**:	Look at 90 or 180 day Chart for LST on MOR CX - LST was stable around 50NCC before Steam Wave (demand for MCG?).


[01-Jun-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	and pfabs


[01-Jun-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	interesting


[01-Jun-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	See, that's one thing I don't get about the LM orders. I would expect that if I'm buying I'll pay a bit more than CX because I can get it without paying for fuel, and if I'm selling I'll discount it for the cost of fuel saved....


[01-Jun-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Of course, with LST prices doing their thing, FLX is probably the next to go wild. Price doubled in a week and is slightly underproduced now.


[01-Jun-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	you also have to account for urgency or ability of delayed payments (and thus market evolution)...


[01-Jun-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	I really hope that the new contract system will allow automation of some steps.


[01-Jun-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	yep that urgency is really the factor there


[01-Jun-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Like, selling items. If I have it to sell when I post the ad, why can't I autoprovision that like a shipping contract?


[01-Jun-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	Or make payment immediate upon delivery, pickup, or split on shipping contracts?


[01-Jun-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	because its not guarenteed to have them at that time


[01-Jun-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	i accepted a contract i didnt have the mats for yet


[01-Jun-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	and was waiting on another supplier to get it to me


[01-Jun-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	But for a sell contract, if you do have it, why can't it autoprovision?


[01-Jun-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	quite literally accepted a selling carbon 2 nights ago for 10 carbon and had another contract where i bought carbon 7 carbon at half cost that the buyer was offering.


[01-Jun-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	you might need something in your production chain


[01-Jun-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Goncourt**:	and depending on the timeliness that changes things


[01-Jun-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	We have a very large unemployed settler population, CHPs and POLs are an excellent investment here on Montem


[01-Jun-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SLMaccabee**:	That exact argument applies to any settler building. Please stop trying to sway new players for your own benefit


[01-Jun-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If new players would specialize Chem would be great for them :)


[01-Jun-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SLMaccabee**:	Ok, have fun having lots of money in an empty mmo


[01-Jun-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	CHP and POL are only a good investment here because the CoGC has been hyjacked by chemistry nerds a couple times! LOL


[01-Jun-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	CHP's and POL's have always and will always be a good investment on Montem no matter what the CoGC is.


[01-Jun-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	From a CHP there's no demand for 8 of the 13 products, and of the remaining ones some have actual demand, some of it is people throwing money on the CX to skew prices long-term. I don't see how a CHP is really all that useful at this point. I'd rather go, honestly, for a PP2, HYF, or WPL.


[01-Jun-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	FLX.NC1, NS.NC1 and PG.NC1 are high volume items and their current prices are crazy high


[01-Jun-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	the planet is perfect for pp1 production, maybe all the chemists should switch to that. that would be best, for me. lets do that


[01-Jun-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noverus**:	FLX is high currently, but I'm expecting people to flock to that one next. Those that do build a CHP to make their own flux will have a surplus and the value will drop after the flood starts.  NS is high, but not many people are using it, likely, because of the excess H2O that goes into HYP. PG volume is high because a few people have orders for 5k or more at low prices, making demand look excessive. For another example of that one look at FE on the CX. 1 company has 110k units of the demand on the buy side, but at prices that will never actually get filled.


[01-Jun-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	not everything you said is correct, as a older player myself. 1k days played total. FLX/NS/PG almost never get overflooded.

[01-Jun-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I mean I started on prom doing resource extraction which doesn't get a benefit from the rather consistently Agri COGC


[02-Jun-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	Prom is for Agri, I run rigs and O collectors there too, but extraction is part of it, cant have agri without water

[02-Jun-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	thats for settlers, or more. new players dont have access to that yet, this Chem is only greed. just another way to keep the new guys downl

**Gourami_Lee**:	the point of a starter planet is for starters, not you


[02-Jun-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	CoGC program its not free. you need 2511 DW, 3348 MCG, 3348 PE and 1674 RAT.... CoGC is expensive and the argument about novice players is strange in this context


[02-Jun-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	well I hate be the one to bring it up, I kinda like our Governor. but Montem seems to be the only having trouble with it.


[02-Jun-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	to be clear, I think this is not anything on his part, just trying some new to fix it.


[02-Jun-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-22 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	think its just bad timing, steam sent a lot new players. it is a starter planet afterall.


[02-Jun-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	WAS a starter planet


[02-Jun-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	there are 418 ghost plots (stupid design choice, but OK)


[02-Jun-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	is a starter planet


[02-Jun-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	either starter planets need to have their real plots increased in the next universe or there needs to be more of them


[02-Jun-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	heh,agreed


[02-Jun-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	with more CX around. I would like to see Outer Haven start with one TBQH


[02-Jun-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	but then again, maybe not. Maybe the far reaches need to be true end-game with infrastructure built to get out there.


[02-Jun-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Its a shame really that OH isnt a starter region. Some more people would really help blow life into the area


[02-Jun-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	@Gourami_Lee still the starter planets have one of the largest pools of free SET/TECH pops. So essentially starter planets may be the best locations to easily switch to higher tier buildings for newer players


[02-Jun-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	The high population of higher tiers is a bit skewed due to the EDU III program, but still for SET/TECH montem/vallis always had a strong workforce


[02-Jun-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	agreed, like I said,its just bad timimg. support the new guys for a bit. let them catch up. then theyll be able to pitch in to the high tiers, as they can (or want). More taxes to help the higher tiers upkeep, too


[02-Jun-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Yep couldnt agree more. I dont actually use that much higher tiers though. As a starter I immediately went for CHPs and never looked back. Added some POLs to go with it. So it is definitely possible to just go for SET stuff from the go. That is also why I am always confused as to why people keep arguing that new guys can't switch to chem or higher tiered buildings


[02-Jun-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	I started a PP2 only because a Corp member told me I could. it made sense. How many of these know that? Chem is started with Sets,  wonder how many dont know that?


[02-Jun-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	yes, need work on the Information given at the gate.


[02-Jun-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Then isn't people in this chat telling others that higher tier buildings are not possible for new players just counter productive? Or that new players should just focus on PIO stuff as that is where the CoGC is at best for newer players


[02-Jun-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	I dont know, Ive read both, but I dont beleive a lot of what there talking about. I think a lot of it in there is in they're best interest not the new guys.


[02-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	but ive playing for a while


[02-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	(lol and still havent complety understand a lot of it


[02-Jun-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	What mostly bothers me is that newer players talk the loudest about how they are right and montem should be PIO. While partly in self interest, partly in best interest of newer guys, some here claimed it might be good to run more Chem stuff here with Chem CoGC. Also exposing newer players to higher tier stuff which they can get into easily. Like you said, sometimes its right in front of you, but only once you've been told about it you realize why haven't I considered this before?


[02-Jun-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	While, I still feel like I am newish, compared to the old time players. So clearly I don't know it al either :)

[10-Jun-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	You make a good point - it would take 4 extractors and 6 smelters to produce 50/day... give or take.


[10-Jun-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	add to that a CHP for flux and a collector for oxygen and you've used up 2/3 of a base.

**Talmar**:	there is no need to make every single thing for yourself. This planet sucks at collecting O, so you buy it from someone else. You also buy the FLX from others as well, because they are making it by the thousand, and you can buy it for cheaper than you can make it. Specialize.


[10-Jun-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I agree that you don't need to make everything yourself - the collector and chemical plan were just to round out the example.


[10-Jun-22 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I don't think it's necessarily cheaper to buy elsewhere. Maybe for some items it is, but then you are exposing yourself to supply problems. I personally prefer to be self-sufficient and minimize my reliance on others. I realize that makes me less efficient but I don't always want to squeeze maximum efficiency out of a base.

[13-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	I did the calculations, and reached the conclusion that it was cheaper than buying and shipping it from the CX


[13-Jun-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	It may be cheaper, but factoring in the opportunity cost and it probably won't be optimal


[13-Jun-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	Its akin to drilling for water in an iron ore mine, but if that's what you enjoy then I wouldn't want to nor can stop you :)


[13-Jun-22 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	and definitely, I haven't done the calculations but I doubt you're losing money on it, most things are profitable in this game


[13-Jun-22 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	The only thing I can't figure out and adapt to is the orbit. Sometimes it takes 4 hrs and sometimes 12 hrs to the CX for the same amount of fuel. Anyone got it figured out?


[13-Jun-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	if you run the command MS OT-580 on an empty buffer you can see an interactive map of the system


[13-Jun-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	the orbits of the planets are simulated, so sometimes the station and montem are right next to each other, sometimes they are on other sides of the sun


[13-Jun-22 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	since you don't have drag in space, if you burn the same amount of fuel over a changing distance, the only thing that changes is the travel time


[13-Jun-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	Yeah, but can you make predictions for the orbit? I've never for sure calculated the pattern.


[13-Jun-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	ahh no I have no clue about that


[13-Jun-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	It seems to take about 2 weeks for a full cycle


[13-Jun-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	but that's a guess


[13-Jun-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Farrent**:	As in they seem to be at their closest that often, they orbit faster


[13-Jun-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	Yeah that's about what I estimated too

**NoChadLee**:	Dear Moria Mortem players. I would need 6 BWS. My new colony is already established (PD-518b) and I would like to start building the infrastructure for further development. I ask you to help with the project. The first step would be 6 BWS. I put the contract on LM. I can produce the other building materials and slowly all will be ready.  Thank you for your help.


[15-Jun-22 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I don't know when my next ship to/from Montem will be, but I listed 24 BWS on the CX


[15-Jun-22 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	Assanova fulfilled the contract.


[15-Jun-22 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NoChadLee**:	the Project (Plan.AdminCenter) begin at next week...


[15-Jun-22 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	The next step will be the LM,and then WH


[15-Jun-22 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	but alone goes slowly


[15-Jun-22 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	By my calculations, CoGC will be up and running in 2 months. When the WH and LM are ready, I'll start uploading the contracts all the time. AMM, GAL and SIO will be available at affordable prices in the market.


[15-Jun-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	I plan to develop the Settlers later.

**PMRV**:	There's no contracts you can send directly to another player.  Either you're both online when you post the ad, so the other party can snatch it immediately or you can prearrange contracts.


[26-Jun-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PMRV**:	E.g. with my shippers I negotiate a rate in DM, this many NCC for this many shipments.  Then they post a LM ad to sell a DW for that amount and I post shipping ads for 1NCC.  No other player would take these contracts since they are unfavorable on their own.

**Knightkai**:	At what point should you start thinking about a second base?


[26-Jul-22 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	when you fill the first,


[26-Jul-22 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	or close to it


[26-Jul-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Knightkai**:	ok


[26-Jul-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	unless you have the means to start another line of production without interfereing with the first


[26-Jul-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	that can get expensive tho


[26-Jul-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Knightkai**:	ok


[26-Jul-22 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gourami_Lee**:	interfering with production, having resource extraction to help the first is not the same thing.

[28-Jul-22 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	not having food will slow down production


[28-Jul-22 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	how many units are you mining on the jobs that are stuck?


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	But weight on the base on the INV page is 622/1500


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	ohhhh


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	160 units


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	thats a lot


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	hah. thats a lot


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	That may be the problem


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	Darn, dumbo me


[28-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	always keep the jobs small


[28-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	if I cancel, will it still grant me the resorces mined so far?


[28-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it normally would, but you need capacity to recieve them


[28-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i would rent a warehouse (or 3) and use those as well


[28-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	should be able to get yo unstuck


[28-Jul-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	I canceled it, it gave me some resorces


[28-Jul-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	Thanks for the help, friend!


[28-Jul-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yep!


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	If a miner cannot mine ore due to "no capacity" how do I see this capacity to free some space?


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	open up your base storage using INV on the left sidebar


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	your base storage is probably full


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	Its not though


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aerluth**:	Weight and volume are not full


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you can either a) move some to a ship or b) rent a warehouse on montem and move some there


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jul-22 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	I've listed my OFF stockpile, but I don't really make the others


[31-Jul-22 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jul-22 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	(according to my calculations)


[31-Jul-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	SUN seems aslo profitable, but probably not a lot of people put up bid orders


[31-Jul-22 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kurisu_Makise**:	yeah SUN had a pretty good profitability if there are enough buyers


[31-Jul-22 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	Ads could be a good idea. Also ensures the production ends up in montem :-)


[31-Jul-22 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Lovehungusall**:	Rubi I understand that you want a healthy market for PoPI goods on the CX but the issue is those items aren't bought regularly but in large batches. People who care to be competitive won't go into an item that doesn't sell all that much or they can't afford to have an item sit on the CX for long periods of time when they can make something else that sells faster with a bit lower profit margin. PE.NC1 and MCG.NC1 are good examples for BMP which OFF/STR/SUN share.


[31-Jul-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	or if you want to help to help increase people to make said products place a good Bid for all of them and resell at a few pennies higher to help out the newer players


[31-Jul-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	and give access to other governors as well. You have the money to do so with all that BSE.NC1 you have pocketed

[03-Aug-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Elnor**:	i thing 2 medium cargo bay its good start for me


[03-Aug-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**irTungsten**:	Parts demand will now peak, as everybody wants those components, this demand will trigger high prices and those high prices will get the whole product chain up and running


[03-Aug-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	that supply will then reduce the price to more affordable levels. The economic cobweb on the supply-demand chart has started its first thread

[04-Aug-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Any hints on where to start?  I'd guess that there are two completely different tracks, depending on whether I want Bigger or Faster ships...


[04-Aug-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	And I'd guess that Bigger is cheaper than Faster?


[04-Aug-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as far as upgrades go, upgrading the starter ship to a MCB or WCB are the easiest choices


[04-Aug-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that will give you a 1000/1000 or 1000/3000 ship


[04-Aug-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	faster is an expensive luxury


[04-Aug-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Thx, makes sense.


[04-Aug-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I have Bases way up North, so Faster would be real nice, tho.


[04-Aug-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Aug-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	It's a starter planet, I got guys doing everything, most of my expensive guys are into chemi, the pioneers do construction, manufacturing, metalurgy,

**Delcat**:	Guess I gotta start making HazMat suits, the price gouging is unacceptable.


[10-Aug-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EggMike**:	whats an acceptable price


[10-Aug-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Historically 1500-2000 is reasonable, cost of production is about 500. 4K is a bit excessive


[10-Aug-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EggMike**:	oh wow lol


[10-Aug-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DarthAraknus**:	seriously why are people pickin pioneers?


[10-Aug-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Lets go either construction or chemistry


[10-Aug-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Warriorofplight**:	Im all for Construction :D


[10-Aug-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EggMike**:	ill vote cons lol


[10-Aug-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	because pioneers boost all area pioneers work into by 10%. whereas Construction only boosts, well, construction...


[10-Aug-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	I'm all down for construction but I also harvest limestone which is something pioneers do.


[10-Aug-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	we got pioneers because they won last week, nothing can change that. Chemistry is ahead in the vote this week. No pro no vote, I think that's just plain STUPID


[10-Aug-22 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	pioneers is fine too. Chemistry is only going to profit a small margin of the industries...


[10-Aug-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	chemistry pays a big chunk of the taxes, kinda the planet policy chosen a couple months ago.


[10-Aug-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	I see polymer plants and chemical plants are affected. do we really have a majority of those on Montem? where can i see the distribution of industries?


[10-Aug-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	industry boosts is 25%, pio boost is measly 10%


[10-Aug-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Choosing pio boost for extracting LST is like picking up pennies while losing dollars


[10-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	It's cheap and the loss of 10% boost won't be huge


[10-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	yes, but PIO boost boost everything under pioneers, whereas Construction boosts only the construction industry. I personnaly don't think there's a better choice here, hence why we vote :)


[10-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	But the productivity increase on construction/chemistry higher tiers is huge


[10-Aug-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	PIO boost will increase profit by 500 per building. While industry boost can increase it from 500-5000 per building

**CaptainCascadia**:	Ty


[11-Aug-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	of there is Oxygene Atmospheric on montem, does it need to be extracted to be used in, say, foundry?


[11-Aug-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yes it would need to be extracted with a COL


[11-Aug-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	ok. then I won't look too much into making my own FE since i would need to extract FEO, collect O2 and then build a foundry and process everything... seems costly and bulky :)


[11-Aug-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	math will tell if it's profitable to produce your own or to import what you need :-D


[11-Aug-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	there is some decent demand on planet to shift some excess production. If you're to sell on CX, take transport into account


[11-Aug-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there is still decent demand for FE here on montem, on the CX less so


[11-Aug-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	O production on Montem is pretty anemic, you'll get about 12 units a day from a collector. LST has a lot more value than FEO, your money ahead to farm LST and buy FEO with the proceeds.


[11-Aug-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but buying and transporting the FEO can be problematic on montem, so its a valid consideration


[11-Aug-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	yep, transportation of FEO and LST can get burdensome.


[11-Aug-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	right now, i'm not even looking at exports... i'm still slowly building a place for my own... starting with construction was a safe choice i think since i can make all the required building blocks.. self sustainability would be cool but i'm not realistically looking to reach that point yet


[11-Aug-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Delcat**:	Patience, don't eat the yellow snow, patience, don't fly unless you have too. patience, if you have too fly slow, fuel prices are low right now, but the'll still eat you alive when your new. patience, I hate instruction books, but their little handbook is full of useful stuff, it's something to do while your being patient

[21-Aug-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wakanda**:	Yes - I bring it in from Verdant


[23-Aug-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I bring up a little from Prom, not great about double local production, one collector covers my needs and gives a few bucks.


[23-Aug-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xhite**:	@Lib saving cargo space and fuel to resupply might make it worth though


[23-Aug-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ditchbuster**:	as a starter base, is it better to just stay in your career/specialty or to build buildings to become more self sufficient?  seems like it would be easier to focus and build multiple of the same building, vs juggling lots of different products and buildings


[23-Aug-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think for the starter base I'd focus on one specialty or production line


[23-Aug-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	thats what most people do


[23-Aug-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I then looked at base 2 to become more self sufficient


[23-Aug-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	FE suppliers here are always paid a premium for conveinience


[26-Aug-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	paying them less than 400/u rarely pays the bills and keeps them going


[26-Aug-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	I sell FE cheaper than 400/u


[26-Aug-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	locally mined and smelted? must be tighter margins


[26-Aug-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	yes


[26-Aug-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	especially with the chem COGC i wouldnt be selling under 400 personally


[26-Aug-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	cost about 250 to make


[26-Aug-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I see it more as a profit per area deal


[26-Aug-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if the FEO, O, and FE are all being made here, thats a lot of area to make the inputs and the FE is less concentrated on montem, so you need more EXTs


[26-Aug-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	sme are small ext not so much


[26-Aug-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuyutsuki**:	anyone have BOR locally?


[26-Aug-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as a rule of thumb, I've always seen FE at a 20% premium on montem over vallis, with the COGC on chem closer to 33% premium


[26-Aug-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if those prices are paid, the profit is at least comparable on each base


[26-Aug-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I make my own everything, but I've always considered 400 to be about the high water mark around here for FE

[26-Aug-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-22 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	To me when you click that final "FULLFILL" the contract is closed.


[26-Aug-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	exactly my point... close feels like "decline and never talk about it again"

[27-Aug-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	A lot of people will take just one of those buildings and make a base full of them. Buy your FE if your a fab builder, buy your ore if you and iron guy, lots of ways to play your game.

[27-Aug-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

So if I see several 400 PE buy ads the odds are that I'll sell, but when I see ads for 10000 units I leave it for someone else and a lot of times I just see them expire. But that's just me!

[02-Sep-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	was there a reset? maybe this explains why I feel like everyone are at a low stage... are reset frequent?


[02-Sep-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	A year ago more or less, I wasn't playing at the time. Don't know if players started over or just shuffled the map. When I came back all my bases were gone.


[02-Sep-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	yeah... I think I did join the game a very long time ago and got turned down by the ui complexity at the time. I do remember the ui and all. and when I came back, "all" (which was almost nothing) I had was gone


[02-Sep-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-22 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alkarym**:	you folks know of any other games that offers this level of depth while still being a low commitment game? I'm looking for another game to browse on when the work is slow... I love that I can come in here, browse for a few minutes, set my production and go...


[02-Sep-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I used to play a game, Lands of Lords, it's medieval city build sandbox game, It had production chains and economy similar to here. Unfortunately it's a one man development team and the guy is a total douche. Player have dropped from 1000+ to a couple hundred over the years.

[03-Sep-22 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kenionatus**:	@Alkarym I'd look into idle games. Some of them combine a lot of systems, so the challenge is deciding which "upgrade" is the best one. Since they aren't multiplayer there usually aren't any negatve consequences to not playing for a while, which is nice. Currently I'm playing Kittens Game on my phone. In the past I played NGU idle on my desktop.

[06-Sep-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Vallis is a better FE source, Montem is in a cx system, and Montem has LST. Those would be the reasons to choose BBH in my view

[09-Sep-22 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Sun-E**:	No, I want to buy RAT and DW


[09-Sep-22 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	Do direct contracts always look that way? Cause it says that you were the party for "Provisioning of 200 units of Basic Rations @ Moria - Montem (OT-580b)"


[09-Sep-22 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DarthAraknus**:	@Rubicate, I know you have been governor for a long time but I am wondering 2 things:


[18-Sep-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	1. Why is settler tax the same as pioneers?


[18-Sep-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	2. Why are we not concentrating on one industry by offering discounts


[18-Sep-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Check vallis taxes to understand what I am talking about


[18-Sep-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I'll answer point 1. There really isn't a reason to tax Pio/Set differently. You aren't magically getting more profits from SET buildings compared to PIO and they roughly cost the same. On the PoPI side of things they don't consume more need than PIO when you account for population sizes. They use the same 2 items for growth (Safety and Health) and don't need an extra building to provide for them.

[20-Sep-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Can anyone help me figure out pricing for selling Limestone on this LM? Like the logic of it. Should it be about equal to the CX rates? Higher? Lower? Considering not having to ship (benefits both sides), instant on-demand delivery, etc etc...


[20-Sep-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	I would say aim for in between cx prices. Split the transport gain with the buyer.


[20-Sep-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	Of course, to the low end will be faster, to the high end faster


[20-Sep-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	I'll also post buy orders when I'm running low. Keeping the same price tactic


[20-Sep-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Sep-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dinglebop**:	@CorgioHero - if you are selecting a recipe for any T1 product, and the recipe will take 7 days to complete, it's likely that you have some basic consumable missing, and the extra time is due to low efficiency. Not many recipes (if any) I know that take 7 days worth of time as a base


[24-Sep-22 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	As Zev said, you can set your production orders to 1 (minimum), and that should be the base time for that to complete. e.g. Running at 100% efficiency, 1 PP2 will produce 1 LDE in 6 hrs.

[25-Sep-22 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**irTungsten**:	and markt prices shift, so they might have shifted away from the time the ad was made or the poster hopes they shift back

**SiltSurfer**:	Don't underestimate fuel costs. If you want your goods delivered relatively quickly, then you can end up spending 1k+ in fuel costs alone.

[25-Sep-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I get that its not really any cargo space, But come on.


[25-Sep-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I just started, money is very tight. And it's literally no cargo space. Plus I have to pay the 50ncc ad fees.

[25-Sep-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Yeah


[25-Sep-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm not using my ships


[25-Sep-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Oh I read your message as “I have literally no cargo space”


[25-Sep-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I guess it’s your call on the balance of how fast you want to grow vs. how much you want to insult shippers lol


[25-Sep-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Yeah it's just way simpler logistically and I'm pretty sure cheaper. I don't want to have to calculate how much I need every x days. Worrying about trying to use minimum fuel which takes 2 days to travel. I'd rather just post a contract for 1 day delivery and someone can grab it who's already going fast.


[25-Sep-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	There's no insult. It's purely supply and demand. If you want to make money shipping, Moria is not the place to be. There's tons of people here who go back and forth empty all the time.


[25-Sep-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	That is...


[25-Sep-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	quite the statement.


[25-Sep-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I would base your shipping price on price per ton - 5 or more will have people ship for you. any less, and people probably just won’t ship it out of spite (even if they have the space)


[25-Sep-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I've been doing 9


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Something that little though, what your contracts were. Aren't even an incentive to lift off.


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I haven’t looked at your ad, but if you’re only shipping 0.1 tons, that’s kinda weird haha


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But I guess people picked it up anyways.


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	He was


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	his contracts were all like


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	.3


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	for 10


[25-Sep-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Because I'm targeting people who are already making the trip. They aren't making the trip just for me. That'd be dumb.


[25-Sep-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	It does take some effort to log in, and actually fulfill the contract. It’s simple, but a lot of people need a bit more of a reason to spend even a few seconds doing so.


[25-Sep-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I understand what you’re saying, and it makes senze


[25-Sep-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	*sense


[25-Sep-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	There's people who have empty space to fill. So it's literally an option between no money or some money for those people.


[25-Sep-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Considering that I'm making about 10k NCC revenue, ~ 4k profit off of shipping contracts right now. It's not a dumb idea to literally hire our an entire hull of cargo.


[25-Sep-22 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It just depends on your needs. You're right, something is better than nothing.


[25-Sep-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	And some people definitely will, but you should honestly look at it as a favor they’re doing for you. I wouldn’t pick that contract up simply because I want to get peoples goods quickly and efficiently, and 10 NCC doesn’t matter enough for me to make sure I log in to do so


[25-Sep-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	When I ran a constructor base, I would constantly be running to the exchange basically empty (just lightweight BSEs). So I could easily ship, for example, a full cargo of limestone to the exchange for someone if they wanted.


[25-Sep-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LarryTee**:	I often pick up shipping contacts if am flying empty mostly as like you said something is better than nothing


[25-Sep-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Yep, makes sense. I dont disagree with what you’re doing at all


[25-Sep-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	You said 5 ncc per ton or more? I hadn't been paying that close attention, I just did some quick math one time based on ads that were already posted, and they came out to 9 per ton. So I assumed that was the rate.


[25-Sep-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Depends on the person, some pay less, some pay more.


[25-Sep-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	The end of the story is that the shipper should be making a profit, rather than breaking even, as some people think is okay to do.


[25-Sep-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I refuse to ship contracts that only 'break even'


[25-Sep-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	If you're curious, though I'm sure you could guess, those .3 shipments were the different prefabs for me to expand


[25-Sep-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	You go right ahead and refuse, someone else will happily pick up the contract for any price rather than run empty.


[25-Sep-22 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LarryTee**:	If am flying anyway I might as well pay for some of my fuel rather than pay for non of it


[25-Sep-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It's a buyer's market, unfortunately.


[25-Sep-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Seller's market?


[25-Sep-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Opportunity market honestly.


[25-Sep-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	If you want to make money shipping, you need to go off the beaten path. Check the local markets for planets that are out of the way. Actually I think the way it works is they'll post at their nearest exchange


[25-Sep-22 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	That's not entirely correct.


[25-Sep-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	A lot of the LMs are just kind of posted haphazardly, and even then travel costs + time should be accounted for. Far distant planets are, as you guessed. 1 Expensive to go to. 2. Need to have a means of making money on the return trip, or enough to go there in the first place.


[25-Sep-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Yes. And supply and demand will naturally balance itself out. Those people will keep posting their ads for higher and higher prices until shippers bite.


[25-Sep-22 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Or keep their posts up for months at a time with literally no one touching them. But IIRC that was just a 'storage' scam last I checked.


[25-Sep-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	you'll need to open up the contract and then there's an option to pickup the contract, which will then put it into your inventory


[29-Sep-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	then when you arrive at the delivery location in the contract there's an option to deliver


[29-Sep-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, I do. How do I do the custom contracts? Do I have to go to his profile?


[30-Sep-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	you need the company's name, then use buffer CONTD to create one


[30-Sep-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	set up your parameters and then enter their name at the bottom and send it to thenm

[30-Sep-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	If the contract is created, the payment part would be one of the conditions you listed. If the contract has already been sent, it just needs to be closed (accepted) by your partner and then it functions like any other contract

[02-Oct-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Yes, I have PRO, but it really reduces the appeal of using the LM when so few people can even use it.


[02-Oct-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	They should make it so everyone can accept contracts even if they've never had PRO.


[02-Oct-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	A lot of players have had PRO at some point. At least enough to make the LMs useful.


[02-Oct-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	I think it's a fair deal. It's not like one of those pay to play, you can manage fine without PRO. But you get a couple of convenient benefits without automatically getting an advantage to other players.


[02-Oct-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Nah I think the LM contracts being available to everyone to accept is pretty critical. It literally lessens the value of it, because it's available to less people, and there's no getting around that. I feel like I don't even want to use it and just use the exchange instead. It would be enough to make it so only pro can POST contracts.


[02-Oct-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Varlun, you have barely any competition on the LM.  It can take me days to sell LST at the prices you are getting


[02-Oct-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Not to mention he's only able to sell at those prices, because there's a ton of players with 100+ days on here, that couldn't care less about most prices.


[02-Oct-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It only works because of those players. Which is fine, because it works, but if this was day 1 when the server was fresh, you'd never sell.

**Xk37**:	It's simple: more people who like chemistry voted for that. I also think it's a waste of potential, but trying to convince the chemistry nerds of that is futile.


[03-Oct-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Honestly, I prefer that answer. I spent over an hour looking through all the tiers of chemistry building and trying to understand WHY that was the choice, but the ROI on all of them seemed to be worse than construction even with the boost so it I was convinced that I was missing something. Seems that I'm not. So all good. Thank you.


[03-Oct-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The high-end chemistry buildings can be very profitable. If you're basing your assessment on the CX prices, be aware that higher-tier products often don't end up on the CX so it's hard to get a good feel for their prices from there. People tend to trade them internally in their own corp


[03-Oct-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	For those complaining about LST prices... I am currently producing 55 every 12 hours and selling on the LM. Soon to add another extractor (11 per 12h).


[03-Oct-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Been selling at 120/e

**SomeKnight**:	The ROI of chemistry is literally through the roof. The advance material labs is literally bonkers. But otherwise I'm with you all in wishing that Montem was the construction planet. It literally makes the most sense. Move the Chemistry to Danakill. That and probably because "FLUX FOR THE FURNACES"


[03-Oct-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I guess the chemistry ROI is invisible for me as the only data that I have to work with as a dumb noob is cmx data


[03-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	On the main discord, there's a link to community servers, with community tools.


[03-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It's worth exploring what's useful for you.


[03-Oct-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm using PRUNner but that still uses CMX data - if folks are making $$$ using in corp contracts that is invisible to me


[03-Oct-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Even with PRUNner, you should still be seeing some crazy numbers, especially with good efficency with most CHEM related buildings.


[03-Oct-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButterMyWaffles**:	How is farming carbon for making a decent living ?


[04-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Uh


[04-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	not on Montem, that's how.


[04-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Montem / Vallis are NOT farming planets by any means.


[04-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You can however absolutely make incinerators on here, and just import the agri needed to burn burn burn... but Vallis would probably have a healthier market for that if you ever bought something to get basic.


[04-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	I see


[04-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	Thank you


[04-Oct-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	I did notice the fertility wasn't great but I didn't wanna be to far from the exchange...


[04-Oct-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Fertility isn't the issue, it's the water extraction for the most part.


[04-Oct-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Extracting water on Montem costs more than buying it.


[04-Oct-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You can make very slim margins in RATs - but you're basically better off just pulling out limestone and throwing out out on the market for way less effort


[04-Oct-22 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	Ah I see


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	Thanks


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	As far as I can tell, the best thing you can do is make an extractor to pull out LST, a BMP to make MCG and a PP1 to make BSE


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	can I just but the water in the short term


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Those are going to be your primary money makers


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	buy * rather then extracting


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	Okay


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yes


[04-Oct-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You can but again, you're really not going to make much money doing that.


[04-Oct-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	I see


[04-Oct-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	I have already built the infrastructure to farm and incinerate plants into carbon


[04-Oct-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I buy the water to run my 2 farms which basically break even. They make no real money. The food processor makes about 1k a day though and removes the  need  to buy RATS - but if I had to do it all over again I wouldn't do it.


[04-Oct-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButterMyWaffles**:	I see


[04-Oct-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-22 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	LST has been very high for a while lately, but it goes in ebbs and flows


[04-Oct-22 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-22 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-22 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	@sun-E, at 30 per MCG you are not competitive for me.  MCG is currently hot.


[05-Oct-22 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Where is there a more competitive price? NC1 is 32 but with fuel costs, its not worth it


[05-Oct-22 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Axxiff**:	34


[05-Oct-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Axxiff**:	and that only because somebody undercut the lowest price by 1.95 / unit


[05-Oct-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Thats buy price, and even then its not worth it for the fuel it costs to go there


[05-Oct-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Axxiff**:	Depends on the amount you can sell but for 200 units you are correct


[05-Oct-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Axxiff**:	If you have 1k+ units in your inventory it is worth it though ^^


[05-Oct-22 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, probably true. I meant more for Sun's 200 order


[05-Oct-22 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Axxiff**:	yea well then it is absolutely not worth hauling unless you need to go to the cxl anyways ^^


[05-Oct-22 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Fuel cost is about 1500 return trip, so Sun-E saves himself that.  As a seller I want a bit of that saving so asking for more than CX seems very reasonable.  I’m sure that there are other sellers who would meet 30 per unit, but not me


[05-Oct-22 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	How much do you pay then?


[05-Oct-22 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	10% under CX seems resonable


[05-Oct-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	As a seller 10% above CX (but I’m not PRO so can’t actually sell atm).  Game market are not like real markets, time is a more important commodity than cost so players will pay extra to reduce time to next build/next manufacture


[05-Oct-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	So you pay more than 32 per mcg?


[05-Oct-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	That’s why Sun-E is advertising that he wants to buy MCG since he can’t build without the MCG.  To get to the CX would take 6-10 hrs round trip.  If he does want to wait that long then he should pay a premium.


[05-Oct-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Well until just now, he had the only buy order up for MCG on local. His prices are perfectly fair


[05-Oct-22 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	His price is fair if you are willing to sell at that price.  A higher price is also fair if you are willing to buy at that price.


[05-Oct-22 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Anything above like 300 per 200 units is fair because of the fuel costs


[05-Oct-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	But your calculation does include any value for my time.  Assuming I flew to CX bought the goods and then sold to LM, what value should I apply to that time.


[05-Oct-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I usually fly when I'm asleep, so nothing. Plus I save on fuel costs so it evens out


[05-Oct-22 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	So poor Sun-E has to wait two sleeps for you to get him the MCG from CX at 30 per unit, when he wants the MCG now.  In my view if he wants it now he pays a premium.  That is fair.


[05-Oct-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BeBopLula**:	As I said, there are payers who would quite happily fill the order at 30.  But you don’t seem to realise that you are actually not costing your goods correctly


[05-Oct-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	But I am as I'm saving 1780 on fuel. If I sell 200 to the market, I make about 220. If I sell direct I make the full 2000


[05-Oct-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Or you wait until you have a full cargo, since you would never fly to the CX completely empty.


[05-Oct-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	But that takes that long to make, its faster money (and virtually the same) to sell direct


[05-Oct-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	It would take nearly 1.75 real life years to make a full ship worth of MCG

**Lib**:	if i'm not going to cx anytime soon - i'll buy it at cx price max.


[10-Oct-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	if i'm planning to go to cx - it has to be cheaper than cx.


[10-Oct-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	if i'm desparate and my workers are starving for it - i'll buy it at max 150% of cx price.


[10-Oct-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Welp, we'll see if my current listing sell I guess.


[10-Oct-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zeskos**:	So should I get rid of the extractor then?


[13-Oct-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	You're better off buying the iron (and maybe limestone as it means you can use those pops for another pp1 or something)


[13-Oct-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dinglebop**:	@Ditchbuster - you just need to bring the fabs required for whatever buildings you're planning on building. That said, you need to take into account the building materials for the Core Module (CM). That is the first building that needs to built for any base, and requires 12 PSL, 4 LDE, 4 LTA, 4 LSE, 12 TRU, and the relevant construction materials (MCG, HSE, AEF, INS, etc.)


[14-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	*8 TRU


[14-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ditchbuster**:	ok thanks! that explains why i couldnt find a CM to buy.


[14-Oct-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I had the same issue/question ;P. Only variable to take into account is the construction materials. You can  look on the community tools site to find out how to calculate the necessary materials or you can look at the materials for the CM by clicking 'start base' after opening a new buffer: 'PLI {desired planet}'

[14-Oct-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Well the idea of each planet needing specific X Y Z mats probably doused that idea right out the water, but you could always have the CM be built with standardized parts and then add in the extra bits afterwards like now. It's a terrible idea now that I think about it.

[17-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	The COGC list shows the currently winning vote, you have to go into the actual vote to see the other options. Pioneers is by far the best option for the starter world as it will help every new player, second to that is the Construction one as this is the construction starter planet


[17-Oct-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-22 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Income is probably most people's obstacle honestly.


[17-Oct-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Income meaning not enough liquidity to switch  industries? Or lack of income in chem?


[17-Oct-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Like, in a few weeks when I transition to my 2nd base, I'll be oppressing the non chem peasants on here.


[17-Oct-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Well honestly, I'm sure a lot of people don't understand what makes chem profitable. + the capital investment is a bit hefty depending on what route you go.


[17-Oct-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	And don't take it as me saying this is how I feel. I'm gonna be turning my Montem base into an AML factory.


[17-Oct-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It's just that I've seen a lot of people asking chem questions in here, just to never be answered by just about anyone doing chem lol.


[17-Oct-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I thought the same thing, but I feel like it doesn't make sense. If building a base full  of PP1s was still  the most profitable thiing per dollar invested out there, I would have agreed


[17-Oct-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Well keep in mind the average age of the companies on Montem who aren't in chem.


[17-Oct-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It's very unfair to say that 'it doesn't make sense'. When they literally can't afford to go into chem. The lower tier Chemical related industries are about on par with PP1s, and arguably worse than just pumping out LST.


[17-Oct-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	The reason I switched to chem was simply because I believed the COGC would stay chem, and the 25% boost outweighed everything else. Since then, it's paid off


[17-Oct-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	*Takes a glance at CHP* NVM


[17-Oct-22 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	When I first started, and saw both  FEO and LST on Montem, my thinking was very solidly in the camp of "if we have both resources for bfabs on  planet, wtf would anyone build anything else"


[17-Oct-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	But having gotten used to the game and looked at all the other options, that argument isn't really worth much anymore IMO, considering how cheap FEO/FE is. So cheap in fact that  lots of people would rather pay more for AL and have to deal with importing/exporting less


[17-Oct-22 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I was  the  only NAB  producer  (so it seemed) at MOR for like two months. My margin was at like 80% per unit after taking into account COGS, workforce, deg, etc.. and I felt guilty (still do) listing as high as I do


[17-Oct-22 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Seeing the anti-chem comments then was even more crazy than now XD


[17-Oct-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So, I just want to point out, that irregardless of profit per unit, NAB at the rate you're selling at, is less profitable than BSE with FE. (Assuming everyone is buying/selling at the sell rate) There is a good argument to be made,


[17-Oct-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	but not with NAB as far as I'm mathing out.


[17-Oct-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	In the past, sure w/e. But it's now old timer!


[17-Oct-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Back then it was selling swiftly at 120/u


[17-Oct-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Well that's back then, not now!


[17-Oct-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	which was crazy high, ill admit


[17-Oct-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	it at least sold in bulk at 120/u a few times, which was enough to take most of my stock off the market at the time


[17-Oct-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I wonder if there's any settler tier building that has a good margin on a fast selling commodity.


[17-Oct-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	PG

**Dinglebop**:	EPO


[17-Oct-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Also, I was buying BOR at 180-250/u at the time and had a H pipeline feeding me at something like 30/u (after shipping) so NAB was still crazy lol


[17-Oct-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	TL;DR - People with 150 day+ accounts wondering why newbies who started in construction on montem are not doing chem...


[17-Oct-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	While I totally get the ROI benefit of transitioning to chem, it's a non trivial undertaking for new players at all. I asked about Chem weeks ago when I was super new and just got told "Oh yeah AML makes so much money" - my entire colony is ~261k....a single AML is what - 1 mil or so?


[17-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	If it makes you feel better, the person who told you that was ME... maybe someone else as well, another 20 some day old lmao.


[17-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But POL which is far more achieveable by a new player averages about 5k profit daily, compared to 2.3k PP1s, but it depends on your goals, needs, and desires of course.


[17-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	If to many people transition into chem, it gets bloated.


[17-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	NTL;JRI: Not wondering why newer players aren't getting into chem. Wondering why players also with equal playtime  actively  advocate for anything except  chem, maybe...  Also chem is more than AML - i dont have one

[18-Oct-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Maybe its because Montem is a starter world and therefore Chem doesnt make sense to anyone but old/experienced players. How is Montem any better than Vallis as I swear that you'd have to buy all your materials anyway?


[18-Oct-22 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Whilst Mortem is a starter, I can see why Chem makes more sense once you hit a reasonable profit from LST extraction.  Im at ~400 area, best return with pioneers at 500 area gets me c 48k/day with 4 more BMP.  If I build 4 POL in the same space with Chem I get 57k/day


[18-Oct-22 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Why not go to Vallis? Dont you have to buy all the materials for the POL, AML, CHP, etc rather than being able to get them from the planet itself?

**DarthAraknus**:	LST is good to make Chem products


[18-Oct-22 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You need the LST extraction to get the money to switch to POL etc.  Vallis with bonused FE production is about 1/3 as profitable.  Im 1 month old, I tried Vallis set up first and it obvious even without Pioneers bonus that Mortem was far better


[18-Oct-22 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	FYI my current set up is 7 EXT/3 PF1/3 BMP/1 FP


[18-Oct-22 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	PF1? What is that?


[18-Oct-22 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Ok, so going by all the chemistry building directly (not with extra buildings before to make some of the needed materials), none of the most profitable things need any LST


[18-Oct-22 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Making 1 of each chem building plus the required housing and producing the most profitable thing in each is only like a 5k/day difference between Montem and Vallis. Montem being 103k-110k and Vallis being 105k


[18-Oct-22 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Its virtually the same price


[18-Oct-22 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	sorry PP1


[18-Oct-22 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah so presently it makes sense for you to go pioneers too?


[18-Oct-22 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Oh, the profits that I quoted above are without experts and without the cogc bonus to make it a level playing field. Its roughly the same gap if you have the chem bonus too, basically 40k on top of the other values


[18-Oct-22 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Turns our I missed a calculation. They both make the exact same assuming all experts and cogc stuff is the same


[18-Oct-22 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	as has been stated, there are LST inputs into Chem so Mortem is a better world than Vallis for Chem.  As a starter world, Pioneer bonus would help Mortem starters but they already have a huge bonus over Vallis starters due to LST extraction being so profitable


[18-Oct-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	If you're using the LST chem crafts, youre wasting money/profits. None of the LST crafts are more profitable than other possible crafts in every chem building

**Varlun**:	Finally, made a sale


[18-Oct-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	LST price took a tumble at the end of last week when the sell price was undercut by 25 NCC, it won’t rise above 130 until this order gets picked up.  If you can afford to sit on your stockpiles it could move in a day or two


[18-Oct-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Hopefully it doesnt rise again else PP1 production wont be worth it


[18-Oct-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	FE.NC1 has been down recently and this has a bigger impact on BXX profit


[18-Oct-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Not really, not for BSE anyway as its 2x LST, and as LST has gone up by 30 ish in the past 2 weeks (based on the prices I've been paying), I'm down atleast 30 on that, plus BXX has dropped like 400 so that suckls

[18-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SomeKnight**:	Don't believe Varlun's lies, the only reason he's lowering his prices is because he finally has someone 'competing' with him, lmao. All of your contracts were at minimum 10% above CX rate until others showed up.


[18-Oct-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Not that it matters to anyone around in either case.


[18-Oct-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm sorry? I literally just said, at 12:05 PM a few messages up, that yes I was selling for a very high price earlier. Why wouldn't I if I could? It's basic supply and demand mate, and I'm sorry if pointing that out triggers you. But you're right, I'm only lowering price because my limestone wasn't selling anymore. That's ALSO basic supply and demand. No need to be upset about it.


[19-Oct-22 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	@SomeKnight


[19-Oct-22 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	uh, dude, you tended to lower specifically after someone else undercut you.


[19-Oct-22 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It depended on whether I had a stockpile built up or not. I wasn't undercutting at first. But this past day or so I had built up 600+ limestone I was trying to move. And it finally did


[19-Oct-22 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yeah, took me a while to sell mine too, though yours only sold after mine did


[19-Oct-22 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but I still saw you lower every time I also did, and another person


[19-Oct-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you can't complain about competition and expect us to believe that you were acting 100% independently of other sellers, lol


[19-Oct-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I never said I was


[19-Oct-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that was still your implication


[19-Oct-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Supply and demand is equal parts supply, and demand


[19-Oct-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	dude, you're on a game that all the rest of us are *also* nerdy enough to play and enjoy XD you're preaching to the choir, dorkus, but that has nothing to do with what you were claiming, is all.


[19-Oct-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I really don't understand


[19-Oct-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	How did I imply something


[19-Oct-22 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you disagreed with someknight that you lowered because of other people? the only other alternative at that point would be that you were lowering purely of your own initiative, but like, I *was* one of those people to you lowered because of


[19-Oct-22 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I disagreed with him getting upset at my actions


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	And I literally said he was right


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	which is it dude, did you react to competition, or were you oblivious despite what you complained about?


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	no no, you said you "only" lowered your rates because they weren't selling


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I disagreed with him saying "Don't believe Varlun's lies"


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	which still is basically a declaration that it had nothing to do with anyone else selling


[19-Oct-22 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you've been pretty loudly complaining about competition


[19-Oct-22 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	In a joking manner, yes


[19-Oct-22 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	*snerk* sure, sure. which is why you sounded so salty when talking about how supposedly other people only got into limestone because of things *you* said


[19-Oct-22 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Mate


[19-Oct-22 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I guarantee you I did limestone before I knew your name


[19-Oct-22 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	At one point I said something like... "...but now I have all this *gags* /competition/"... It was sarcasm.


[19-Oct-22 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yes, I remember that, lol, and other things you said too


[19-Oct-22 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I don't always look at chat, usually ignore it really, but half the time when I bother to look, I see you either bragging or complaining XD


[19-Oct-22 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm just talking man


[19-Oct-22 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	But let me explain your earlier question


[19-Oct-22 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I said I "Only lowered prices because my stuff wasn't selling". My "stuff not selling" is a complex situation, which automatically includes every facet of supply and demand. It includes people not willing to pay a high price anymore, and yes it also includes other people undercutting me- an abundance of supply.


[19-Oct-22 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	hey, I'll agree that it was kinda weird that there was a huge demand and suddenly it dried up for a couple days, that was very odd.


[19-Oct-22 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	But all I was really trying to do was argue with him saying "Don't believe Varlun's lies".


[19-Oct-22 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	well right, because the implication he was addressing was the concept that you only lowered prices to meet what people are willing to pay currently, and not because of other listings undercutting you. that's what he was trying to say there.


[19-Oct-22 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	And he was wrong, because I wasn't making that implication, he misunderstood what I was saying


[19-Oct-22 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	at no point did you acknowledge the undercutting or competition until after I said something, though


[19-Oct-22 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you stood pretty firmly by the declarations you were already making


[19-Oct-22 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Because I didn't even realize what the problem was until you pointed it out


[19-Oct-22 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I'm not disputing the part about it not selling, it wasn't selling, no. I'm just saying, that wasn't the "only" reason, like you were saying.


[19-Oct-22 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	nah, the lower prices weren't selling either, there was a drought of sales for a couple days no matter the price, except the buy orders of course


[19-Oct-22 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I still stand by what I said. I lowered prices "only" because my stuff wasn't selling, which as I just explained, includes lower demand and higher supply


[19-Oct-22 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but I find it hard to believe that you didn't notice the other sellers when you undercut me specifically by 1 nnc each a few times


[19-Oct-22 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I did notice.


[19-Oct-22 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	At no point during this entire time have I claimed I wasn't part of the undercutting game


[19-Oct-22 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	well no, because you didn't acknowledge it at first either, lol


[19-Oct-22 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	anyway


[19-Oct-22 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I've said what I have to say


[19-Oct-22 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	peace out


[19-Oct-22 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	You're literally arguing over nothing, feels like. Like you just have a problem with me for no reason. I've been straight up in everything I've been saying. Perhaps it would help if I mention that I have Asperger's? Sometimes I don't realize what I'm saying. But we're pretty much agreeing on everything except the part about me ever having any ill intent.


[19-Oct-22 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	These people dude. Don't know what their problem is. Literally trying to make a big deal because I *didn't* say something. What a joke.


[19-Oct-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CMH**:	To me whenever @Varlun talks about his deals it's just another advertisement. I don't think he outright lied, just like any advertisement. Facts were just "tactfully omitted".


[19-Oct-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CMH**:	Nothing to argue about really


[19-Oct-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CMH**:	If real world laws was in effect in this game, there's tons of practices in the game that would land people in jail


[19-Oct-22 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	That's the thing though, I wasn't intentionally omitting anything. If I had realized it was a problem I would've said something about it much earlier, no problem.


[19-Oct-22 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	It’s just a game though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[19-Oct-22 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dirk_Diggler**:	You guys are going to look back on this and both realize you are being ridiculous. The price of tier 1 goods means literally nothing once you get to the 3-4 month mark and even less so as you continue to grow. whether you sell 10% above or below market for any tier of good means literally nothing and there are under 20 people in this game that have the ability to truly affect or control a market and we don't because it isn't worth the time, we have done it before for fun and overall potentially puts a bad taste in new players mouths and could cause them to quit which we don't want.  My advice, play the game how you want, don't EVER impress your style of play on ANYONE and in the end we all prosper.


[19-Oct-22 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I thought....


[19-Oct-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yep, pretty sure it had a 2k lead as construction voters swapped


[19-Oct-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	right, yeah, they swapped over and we were ahead, so that's.... a bit odd, you'd think pretty much anyone that was going to vote would have already voted by then


[19-Oct-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'll vote for Chem for 1k per vote - give me your nerd money


[19-Oct-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	lol, by "per vote" do you mean, per point of your vote-weight? heh


[19-Oct-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I really dont get why people dont go to Vallis and do chem there, the profits are the same. And the LST crafts (because we have extraction) cant be a valid excuse because if you want to maximise money, dont do the LST chem crafts


[19-Oct-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	lack of open plots on vallis


[19-Oct-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I'd swap for 1k per vote, 500k a week bonus is pretty decent


[19-Oct-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, sure, I'd throw in my own weight at that point too, lol


[19-Oct-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the matter that its a close vote for PIOs is rather silly


[19-Oct-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I get why it is, but not for a starter planet that isnt chem based. PIO benefits every new player and a lot of others. Chem benefits a select few people that have enough voting power to sway it in their favour


[19-Oct-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	It should be chem vs construction. But, now that Danakil exists as a construction COGC, theres less of a need for one here


[19-Oct-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, construction makes the most sense for specialised, but it doesnt benefit people that extract lst, hence pio would be better suited


[19-Oct-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there are electronics planets around montem now, here its not optimal for sure


[19-Oct-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	just the shipping between here and vallis that's more ideal for me, lol


[19-Oct-22 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	really? 1 jump shipping is usually more reliable than inter-system with the planet orbits


[19-Oct-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hmm, perhaps. But too much invested to change the setup right now lol


[19-Oct-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats fair, outside of smelting vallis is kinda limited anyway, electronics here isnt too bad


[19-Oct-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Put Chem COGC on Vallis and its the same profit as Montem


[19-Oct-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but the opportunity cost of not having a smelting COGC there is too high


[19-Oct-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Oh well, we dont need it here though


[19-Oct-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the entire HAL>CL>EPO product chain is critical for construction


[19-Oct-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if the argument is that bfabs should be made here, thats fine, but then a construction COGC should be pushed


[19-Oct-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Indeed, but pioneers gets more than construction


[19-Oct-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if all the PIO people voted construction it would be a close vote...


[19-Oct-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, it was when CONS went PIO, but PIO benefits more people


[19-Oct-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Either Chem or Construction COGC needs to be pushed. Anyone pushing for PIO doesn't understand shit about this game


[19-Oct-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	If you wanna help new players, you need to be pushing construction, not PIO


[19-Oct-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	since all new players that start on Montem are Constructors


[19-Oct-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Swear you need pro to vote? And nobody goes Construction, hence we vote PIO


[19-Oct-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Keep voting for construction and it will win out eventually competing with Chem


[19-Oct-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	The argument of moving votes to PIO is what's making Chem actually win


[19-Oct-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	15k PIO and 15k CONS is bad as it will never beat CHEM, so 30k PIO iss better


[19-Oct-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	That's not a good reason to vote for PIO


[19-Oct-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Stick with your guns and keep voting Construction, that will give more people confidence to vote for Construction


[19-Oct-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	No, it literally wont


[19-Oct-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I put out a lawn sign "Vote Pioneers" to raise awareness. We'll win for sure now.


[19-Oct-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	People with only extractors benefit from PIO more than CONS, making it benefit most people


[19-Oct-22 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah but votes in this game are rigged and not tied to 'players' etc so it's a mess


[19-Oct-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, the weighted system sucks


[19-Oct-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's not 1 vote per account or even 1 vote per pop so the whole thing is goofy


[19-Oct-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Tbh its like real life democracy, the top people rule everything


[19-Oct-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ehhh that's a can of worms that I am not touching


[19-Oct-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Is there anyway to see previous vote results?


[19-Oct-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	From the game perspective, I think it's poor design though as it essentially 'ruins' the 'starter' world and new players are powerless to do anything about it as their votes are drowned out


[19-Oct-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yep, it sucks. I dont see why people dont wanna take care of new players to try and grow the game


[19-Oct-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	F you, got mine.


[19-Oct-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	What?


[19-Oct-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	That's the attitude


[19-Oct-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Oh, I thought you meant that at me rather than what they are like


[19-Oct-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Which isn't even really wrong - there is noting inherently wrong about voting for 'your' interests


[19-Oct-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	True, I get that, but it should be what benefits the most people


[19-Oct-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	it's a game design issue that these interests are at odds with the new players interests


[19-Oct-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't know how youd fix that though so meh


[19-Oct-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Scrap the weighted voting and do it on raw pop


[19-Oct-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It would help but still skew heavily to established players who could easily just run some pioneers on random chores just to increase vote power


[19-Oct-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	True, but it should help a little bit?


[19-Oct-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	In theory


[19-Oct-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah I don't disagree that it'd be better but I think it'll still get meta gamed


[19-Oct-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	The only other way I suppose would be for it to be coded based on the amount of buildings of each type? Like if theres 100 Chem buildings but 150 Cons building then it should swap to Cons bonus


[19-Oct-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the votes system is directly tied to worker type. PIOs get 1 vote, Settlers 1.2, etc etc. The reason higher tier workers get more votes is because their building types are less dense and get easily outvoted by PIO bases


[19-Oct-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its a poor attempt to balance the votes so that those that employ advanced workers dont get trampled by the masses of PIO bases (but most of them still do)


[19-Oct-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I dont really care which +25% bonus runs, as long as there is a decent amount of the planet population that benefits from it OR there is a mutual synergy with secondary industries


[19-Oct-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	running +10% COGCs to any group (including PIOs) is a waste of 15% productivity on the planet scale


[19-Oct-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	PIO is a shit bonus and you newbies arguing for it is more stupid


[19-Oct-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yes - we are stupid for wanting the only bonus that is actually a bonus for us.


[19-Oct-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You got any more hot takes?


[19-Oct-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Say it like that then, don't say that the others are conspiring


[19-Oct-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DarthAraknus**:	yup


[19-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's rigged due to weighting


[19-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	That's not a conspiracy


[19-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	You're not going to have new players hitting 2k influence


[19-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	If you wanna benefit from COGC, vote construction. You have PP1 buildings don't you?


[19-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's just not possible for a new player to have an even input into the vote system vs established plaeyrs


[19-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If calling that rigged implies a 'conspiracy' - I want that space weed you are smoking


[19-Oct-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	I have all Construction buildings except 1 CHP


[19-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I think more established players should have a higher weighted vote anyway because they should, in general, have a better understanding of what's good to vote for


[19-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	A lot of established players are like that


[19-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	It's just newbies voting for PIO is making CHEM win


[19-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Vote for CONS consistently for 2 periods and it will start winning


[19-Oct-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	What's good for established players isn't what's good for new players


[19-Oct-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So no - established players setting policies on the starter planet is suboptimal for the new joiners


[19-Oct-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Established players matter more I'd say, because they actually play the game


[19-Oct-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	You from India @Mordgier?


[19-Oct-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SomeKnight**:	Darth, no one was even glorifiying colonialism.


[19-Oct-22 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Ignoring the rest of the pointless drama, the other point about people voting PIO losing to Chem is equally wrong.


[19-Oct-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Whoever did their big boy 2.somethingK votes switching to Chem is what lost the COCG. And perhaps even the leftover 2k on construction that didn't swap to pio.


[19-Oct-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You trying to convince every pio to vote for construction is a losing battle, even now.


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I can't think of a single other world that runs pioneer COGC


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the starter-world argument is valid, pioneer is the most best for the most people


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	There's no world that runs worker COGC


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm not arguing that it's good, I'm just saying that's what historically the votes seem to be. #1 chem #2 Pio #3 like 6k on Con.


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So you've got a heck of a ton of convincing to do.


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but listen, everyone votes on their book


[19-Oct-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you run a bunch of anything but chem, you'll vote pioneer


[19-Oct-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if you run a bunch of chem, you're gonna votre for chem


[19-Oct-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	everyone votes in their self interest


[19-Oct-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and it's equally weighted. players running high-end techs don't really get that many more votes


[19-Oct-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because your overall population goes down, hiugher end buildings require more room


[19-Oct-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it averages out to roughly the same, maybe a bit more depending


[19-Oct-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	At the end of the day it's "Developed bases" vs undeveloped.


[19-Oct-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	for the real vote weight difference.


[19-Oct-22 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It's as low says, everyone votes in their self interest. I voted for chem because apparently that's better for limestone extractors... like me.


[19-Oct-22 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Construction and Pioneers would be equally viable for you as an extractor.


[19-Oct-22 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	though I'd have to do the math on how much LST each type of base would actually end up using.


[19-Oct-22 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Pioneers is a double whammy against me. Chems use less limestone, and people produce more limestone... higher supply, lower demand. No bueno.


[19-Oct-22 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You got suckered into believing that chem folks are buying your LST


[19-Oct-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Aren't they?


[19-Oct-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	They likely are


[19-Oct-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'll be honest it's new to me, don't really know what the best option is. But someone said chem benefits limestone extractors so I went with that


[19-Oct-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Click on LST


[19-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	and you can see what industries use it


[19-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So if you do the simple math


[19-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	anyone making NS uses a ton of LST


[19-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	the buildings that use the most LAST are Construction and BMP per day


[19-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But that's just the simple math, it depends on how many buildings are using it per base, + the amount of bases running X


[19-Oct-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	MCG burns through sooo much more LST than NS


[19-Oct-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	And Pioneers are BMP + PP1


[19-Oct-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	which use LST


[19-Oct-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'd be down for voting construction I guess, but not pioneers


[19-Oct-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	This is a starter planet after all, it should benefit the starting constructors.


[19-Oct-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	COCG benefits the rich, BURN IT DOWN


[19-Oct-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But yeah, as a simple calculation, 1 BMP = 16 LST a day if it's running MCG


[19-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	it takes 2.something CHPs to even use that much daily.


[19-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Don't forget how many relative workers it takes to run each building


[19-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	😐


[19-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You can have 21 bmps


[19-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	BMP takes a whopping 100 pioneers


[19-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	in a 500 base


[19-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	21 x 16


[19-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	336 lsta day


[19-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	chemical plant takes 20 pioneers and 60 settlers, nevermind that's pretty comparable


[19-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	you'd need 84 CHPs


[19-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	to use as much LST as a manufacturing base. BUT that's unfair, Montem doesn't have many manufacturers.


[19-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So let's do construction


[19-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	16 PP1s in a 500 base, 144 lst daily running BSE


[19-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You are just talking about one recipe in the BMP, if you run a BMP you are going to switch it up to whatever is best money wise. (It's the most versatile building in the game)


[19-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Seems to me like chem uses more limestone


[19-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	no


[19-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	wrong


[19-Oct-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	17 CHP in a 500 base


[19-Oct-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	running nothing but NS


[19-Oct-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	85 LST daily


[19-Oct-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Pioneers would mean cheaper limestone, but it would also help me make more limestone, which helps counter it? But the big negative is it makes it more worth it for people to extract their own limestone, right? Or is that also counteracted by the lower price?


[19-Oct-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	It depends on how people have their bases set up. If they're already buying from you, why would that change if it becomes Pio?


[19-Oct-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Look if you don't have to guess this, look at the history  - 42 days ago pioneers ran

**Mordgier**:	look at the chart for LST and the price 42 days ago


[19-Oct-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Dumb it down for me, what happened


[19-Oct-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	What if we voted for resource extraction >:)


[19-Oct-22 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	When my base is maxed out with 5 experts and 31 extractors, I'll be making 782 limestone per day. With an extraction CoGC, that'd be 977 per day.


[19-Oct-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I know it won't happen but, fun to think about


[19-Oct-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	The daily demand at Moria is only about 1000, say goodbye to 120 per unit


[19-Oct-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	That's only looking at the CX


[19-Oct-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Most of it is actually traded by LM


[19-Oct-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'd argue most of it is traded by CONTD, but that's a different issue.


[19-Oct-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Still, what an excellent way to crash LST, I approve


[19-Oct-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	vote RE.


[19-Oct-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	If people buy from LM they don’t buy from CX.  So price on CX goes down


[19-Oct-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It would balance out over time, wouldn't it? People would stop extracting limestone until the price goes back up


[19-Oct-22 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So if people demolish their extractors and make more PP1s/CHPs, that'll increase demand for limestone


[19-Oct-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	But I have a feeling the number of extractors is really small compared to the rest


[19-Oct-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I think the resource extraction CoGC would only make sense for worlds that are resource rich in something


[19-Oct-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	BUT! Cheap limestone WOULD benefit EVERYONE... it would benefit extractors, constructors, and chemical people


[19-Oct-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So... maybe it IS the right call!?


[19-Oct-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	As has been stated, LST is a tier 1 material as players grow they move to later tiers.  There is more money to be made at later tiers


[19-Oct-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Redemptionist makes NS in his full base


[19-Oct-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	You know, for how nerd-heavy the players of this game must be, I'm surprised this problem hasn't been solved into oblivion


[19-Oct-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	What problem?


[19-Oct-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Of what CoGC benefit is best for this planet


[19-Oct-22 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	The only "issue" is that mid-late game players all transitioned to more profitable ventures, (chem) which benefits from some resources on Montem. Are butting heads with every other new player who picked other starter packages.


[19-Oct-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	IMO it's a non issue in either case.


[19-Oct-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	25% bonus is nice, but it's not going to make or break any industry.


[19-Oct-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It's more than 25%


[19-Oct-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Because of opportunity cost


[19-Oct-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	If I'm missing out on a 10% bonus to extraction (pioneers), and the chemical people are getting their 25% bonus, this means lower supply and higher demand for limestone.


[19-Oct-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	I'm gonna flip a coin, to tell me if it's even worth responding to you anymore, brb.


[19-Oct-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Maybe opportunity cost is the wrong word, but you know what I'm getting at. You don't just consider the bonus you're getting, but what you're not getting instead. ...I mean yeah, that's opportunity cost.


[19-Oct-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So my point is, it has more than just a 25% impact on a given industry. The cost of limestone for example.


[19-Oct-22 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Generally the taxes are increased on COGC industry


[19-Oct-22 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	But this planet's governor doesn't like to do that


[19-Oct-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FatKao**:	Like, is this prun trickle down economics?


[19-Oct-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Chem players wont be buying lst if they care about profits (they seem to based on wanting chem cogc) as none of the chem crafts make more money in each chem building compared to other possible crafts. BMP and PP1 are probably the 2 main consumers of lst as theyre the starter buildings for construction. The reason why PIO makes sense is that it boosts BMP and PP1 for new players, as well as extractor (lst) production which therefore helps more as it means more lst can be produced which lowers the price for consumers. PIO is definitely the better option for the wider range of players, especially every starter player


[19-Oct-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Hi! Anyone willing to part with about 10 DW + 10 RAT for a reasonable price?


[19-Oct-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So if PIO benefits at least 2 industries (constructors and extractors), that's 20% right there, if it benefits a third, you're beating 25% to only construction


[19-Oct-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Correct?


[19-Oct-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Daharius** left.*


[19-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Not exactly. An oversimplified way of looking at it is a 25% boost to construction would mean a higher demand for lst, most likely driving up the price. 10% to pioneers means that construction players need more lst, but the extractor players will be able to mine/extract more lst at the same time keeping their relationship nearly the same. However, more lst production means cheaper lst for evwryone else, making it the most beneficial option for construction and lst extraction players. Plus any other basic factory should anyone have any


[19-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm feeling like pioneers is the best option. I've already switched my vote


[19-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Why are the chemical guys on this planet anyway


[19-Oct-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Construction might technically be better as jts the construction starter world, but pioneers benefits way more than just construction players. Im not really sure why chem players are here as surely theres better planets to start on, and im not buying the explanation that chem users buy lots of lst


[19-Oct-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	PP1 is the not the only construction building


[19-Oct-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I never said that


[19-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	I am saying that your argument of PIO benefitting more than CONS is wrong because of that


[19-Oct-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	What? That's nonsense


[19-Oct-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Obviously PIO benefits more than just cons, it benefits everything that uses pioneers


[19-Oct-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	PIO buildings are really low number


[19-Oct-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	You think it benefits a lot because you are new player only using PIO buildings


[19-Oct-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Well then you're wrong? Pio gives a 10% bonus to several buildings, including the bmp and pp1 which are both starter construction buildings. It also benefits lst extraction meaning cheaper lst


[19-Oct-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	There will be more newer players with only pio buildings than there are chem players. On montem anyway


[19-Oct-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	It's not about the type of buildings but the number of buildings in total


[19-Oct-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Wouldn't it be nice if there were some actual statistics showing how many of each building are on a planet


[19-Oct-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Exactly, so new players with only pio buildings means that theres mpre pio buildings than chem buildings. How is that so hard to understand?


[19-Oct-22 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Here's the real question. As an extractor, would it be better for me to sell more limestone at a cheaper price, or less at a higher price?


[19-Oct-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	If you want more profits, you should be moving away from extracting LST


[19-Oct-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	and only extract what you need


[19-Oct-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	My entire company is based on resource extraction


[19-Oct-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	The goal is simplicity, I don't want to have to worry about a ton of inputs and shipping nightmares.


[19-Oct-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	And frickin' spreadsheets


[19-Oct-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	You aren't making any money if you aren't playing the game


[19-Oct-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	It would even out eventually so it technically wouldnt matter in that sense, but youd be making lst a bit more often meaning less time between cycles completing so therefore you could fill orders a tad faster


[19-Oct-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Making EDC is the most simple profitable avenue than LST


[19-Oct-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	I have a full construction base including PIO buildings. With calculations, I can tell you that either CONS or CHEM cogc is more profitable than PIO


[19-Oct-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	If you guys check, no other world has a worker based COGC for a reason


[19-Oct-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	EDC? What type is that? And i can tell you from calculations that pio is more beneficial than chem for a construction base


[19-Oct-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	More profitable for you. But only PIOs benefits me.

[19-Oct-22 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	EDC.NC1?


[19-Oct-22 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Yes


[19-Oct-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	No inputs? Weird


[19-Oct-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	What's EDC even used for?


[19-Oct-22 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	It's sold to market maker


[19-Oct-22 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Its not a mat, its a software tool. And you do realise how expensive it is for a new player to make that? Of course it will be more profitable with it having 0 inputs but the material cost for the building and housing will be more than new players can afford


[19-Oct-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Yeah, but that's the discussion, isn't it? Varlun should be moving away from LST to make EDC if he wants more profits and keep it simple


[19-Oct-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Actually valid, but I wouldn't do it on Montem. Maybe another base


[19-Oct-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, if he has like 800k to sink into redoing his base


[19-Oct-22 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	master, let's see your base. What buildings do you have?


[19-Oct-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	1xBMP making MCG, 5xPP1 making BSE most of the time, but i make other BXX mats when i want more buildings so im not buying stuff i can make


[19-Oct-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Where are you getting FE from?


[19-Oct-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	BBH might actually be making more than BSE as i think BBH price went up


[19-Oct-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Buying it from either CX or LM depending on available ads


[19-Oct-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It's inefficient to make your own stuff funny enough. You should always make what's most profitable


[19-Oct-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Looking at that, you should be supporting CONS and not PIO


[19-Oct-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I k ow i should probably buy the other 3 mats but its jot a big deal


[19-Oct-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	And if i support cons, im guaranteed to not get a bonus. If i support pio, theres a decent chance i will


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm still not sure what benefits me the most, as an extractor


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	Resource extraction


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	That reason is what lead to this planet becoming CHEM. People stopped voting CONS. If we start voting CONS, we can get it back


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	between cons and pio


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Resource extraction, but itll never win. Pio is the next best thing for you as it is me


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	PIO for you


[19-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	But cons means more demand for limestone, good for me


[19-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	No because it drives up the price to the point where people outsource or extract their own, making pio better


[19-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It won't be better for them to make their own, because of experts


[19-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	yup


[19-Oct-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'll have 5 experts and can make limestone cheaper than they can make it themselves


[19-Oct-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Everyone forgets about experts. Specialization is key, going vertical is ass


[19-Oct-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I only have 2 in construction (the next one i got was manufacturing for some reason?) And it barely makes a difference. Its like 30m different per craft


[19-Oct-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	each expert gives more benefit than the last, it's exponential


[19-Oct-22 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	5 experts is HUGE


[19-Oct-22 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Turns out i have my 3rd construction expert now


[19-Oct-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	1 expert is 3%


[19-Oct-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	2 is 7%


[19-Oct-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	3 is 12.5%


[19-Oct-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	4 is 20%


[19-Oct-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	5 is 28.4%


[19-Oct-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So I will have a 28% advantage over someone just dipping their toes into extracting their own limestone.


[19-Oct-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	True. And pio would give you even more of an advantage


[19-Oct-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I really don't know what is better. CONS gives more demand for limestone, PIO means more supply but lower prices.


[19-Oct-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Here's what I kinda think though


[19-Oct-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I think it's really about what we want the planet to be doing as a whole.


[19-Oct-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	CONS is better for sure, but it will never win against PIO, meaning we need to go PIO to beat CHEM


[19-Oct-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	We don't want to be exporting excess limestone, right?


[19-Oct-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	So RE is out of the question


[19-Oct-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	CONS would make our construction outputs more competitive in comparison to other planets


[19-Oct-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	... which has a trickle down effect of greatly increasing demand for limestone


[19-Oct-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Thats true, but youll never get all PIO voters to swap to CONS

[19-Oct-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Why are you so sure?


[19-Oct-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	It's a construction planet. Most people here are here because they chose the constructor start.


[19-Oct-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I think CONS is the best option, overall and also for me. I don't want to have to worry about shipping my limestone, I'm content selling it on the LM.


[19-Oct-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, but new players are unlikely to vote, and PIO also benefits the food and water production (although why anyone does that on montem is another issue)


[19-Oct-22 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Nahhh that's not worth considering imo


[19-Oct-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	If you can convince everyone to swap from PIO to CONS then props to you, ill even swap to help out but i can guarantee you wont succeed in getting others to swap


[19-Oct-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Screw it. We have a whole week. I'm switching my vote to CONS. Let's bang the drum and see how many votes we can get. We can always switch back if we aren't going to beat chem near the end of the week


[19-Oct-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm the first vote


[19-Oct-22 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Spread the word, vote libertarian. Down with the 2 party system


[19-Oct-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	All the PIO voters have constrruction bases IIRC


[19-Oct-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Not all. I know atleast 2 with lst bases (not sure if theyve voted this week yet)


[19-Oct-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I'm one of the ones with lst bases


[19-Oct-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Oh yeah, make that 3 people


[19-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	I have 10 extractors, soon to be 13


[19-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	If we get some good votes (even though not winning) for CONS 2 weeks in a row, trust me, we will become a CONS planet for sure


[19-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	How is your voting weight so low? Thought extractors were 100?


[19-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	60 each


[19-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	no, 60 each


[19-Oct-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Ah


[19-Oct-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Well atleast now i have a campaign idea for this term, now to execute it...


[19-Oct-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Yeah that sucks, they take 25 area for 60 pioneers. Compared to a PP1 that takes 19 area for 80 pioneers.

[19-Oct-22 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	And then there was that filthy strawman of telling people to get into EDC.


[19-Oct-22 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Might as well just tell people to produce drones as a starter. 10/10 most reasonable starter build.


[19-Oct-22 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	You know what else makes a ton of money? Doing chem on Danakill, instead of ousting construction from Montem.


[19-Oct-22 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	So from now on, whenever someone says that chem is better, without providing actual reasons why it HAS to be done on Montem. I'm going to just tell you to git gud, and make DRS, because DRS makes more money than chem plebs.


[19-Oct-22 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Heck, I'll even give you one of the better arguments for why construction probably shouldn't be done on Montem.


[19-Oct-22 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	Importing FE, because metalurgy on Montem is a pale shadow compared to Vallis.

**Dinglebop**:	Gotta respond... I dont think everyone who is pro-chem here believes that Montem is an "ideal" planet as far as on-site resources goes. LST for FLX is a very minor benefit, with Vallis right there, but the resources on Montem are largely besides the point. For me, the main thing is that its in a CX system. Not only is keeping your base supplied relatively easy (importing C, H, HAL, CL, whatever), but because it's in the CX system it's also central to almost everywhere else you go. If you wanted to start another base somewhere else, there's a fair chance you'd be able to integrate your montem chem products straight into your new chain.


[20-Oct-22 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I don't think that the argument that it doesn't serve newer players well doesn't make much sense either. Part of that argument, that i've heard at least, is that your first stop is at the settler level, and people seem to think that that's already unattainable. To counter that, you could simply argue that CHPs only require bfabs, and thus the actual barrier to entry is the same as any other PIO building. In fact, everyone who decides to start on katoa needs to do exactly that - build a REF (settler level) and start refining. At least with chem you're able to diversify quickly and easily (once you get the hang of the UI and such). In fact, once you realize (as everyone does) that lfabs are not out of reach, even at the start, you're able to build a POL, also at the settler level (taking advantage of your already  built infrastructure) with the added cost of *just* LBHs, the cheapest Lfab.


[20-Oct-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I think the other side of the argument, the "why not switch Montem and Danakil" side, is a bit more complicated. I think it begs the question - "why is a COGC good?" A COGC is a way to pump a specific set of products out faster, at a pretty comparable profit margin. It does increase profitability slightly, but that's only because workforce consumables become a fractionally lesser proportion of the COGS. The COGC benefits the population as a whole the most when the benefit can be applied over a range of products. Meaning the CONS COGC should not be designed solely for PP1 production, which it seems is the current argument to put it on Montem. Most fabs on the market do not require FE, and a large portion of the bfabs currently on the market were produced with AL.


[20-Oct-22 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I don't know exactly what the specific arguments were to put construction on Danakil, but I can assume that at least a part of it was that 1-jump FTL flight time from MOR/Vallis to Danakil is much more consistent than STL flight from MOR/Vallis to Montem, which is something that you'd want to consider when shipping heavier products

[20-Oct-22 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Overall, if I were to sum up how I view it: "Why would it be better to put a pure CONS COGC on a planet with the base resources required, when a large portion of the population would need to fill extraction and SMELTING needs to feed it?" If the goal is to reduce bfab prices in MOR, that might make sense. Otherwise, I don't really get the arguments against chem

[21-Oct-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zev**:	Hey VArlun, here's my explanation for not switching to construction, as a nearly pure construction base: 1. Importing enough Iron and buying enough limestone is already a headache, even without the system being disbalanced further by increasing demand for them by 25% at the same time that it goes up for everyone else, with no immediate change in supply. 2. The last time I switched to constructor, I forgot to switch back; it's not like there's a 1 day left reminder.


[21-Oct-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**mast3rd3mon**:	Pretty sure it was the hab buildings that made it worse


[21-Oct-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Pio/Set/Tec/Eng/Sci habs cost the same regardless of what you use them for. CHPs require SET/PIO. Just like REFs do, which to re-iterate is the standard starting building on a starter planet, Katoa


[21-Oct-22 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-22 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-22 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Varlun**:	I think cons would benefit me more, as I'm sure it'd shoot the limestone price through the roof. But I think pioneers is probably the better pick overall. Would anyone like to actually argue in favor of cons? Kinda ironic since I pretty much started the actual cons movement... I think the original argument was about fully utilizing a 25% benefit?

[22-Oct-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	@[MONT] Rubicate I'm sure you don't actually believe a construction bonus would lower prefab prices by 25%. Not a great look to use weasel words to imply otherwise given your position and voting.


[23-Oct-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CMH**:	Don't think he ever said it'll drop it by 25%, just that it'll drop.


[23-Oct-22 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CutterJon**:	The only way the bonus "would hurt construction" is if the price drop offsets the bonus. "Wouldn't help as much" is different.


[23-Oct-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Not that it really matters but 8k BSE dumped would be very quickly absorbed by the market as everyone bought them to resell.


[23-Oct-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Wow, looks like a few people switched their vote from cons to chem. Unfortunate. Anyway, I'm going ahead and switching my vote to pioneers. Seems like construction isn't really desired. Impressive we got as many votes as we did!


[23-Oct-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Vote pioneers!


[23-Oct-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Varlun**:	That's what we've been trying for the past few days. It's not going to happen. And no strong arguments have been made for cons. If anything, the best arguments have been that cons will actually be detrimental to established constructors. So pioneers seems the best option. I was asking for better arguments the past couple days.


[23-Oct-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	i would like to point out that you probably had a few people that were always going to go chem put in for con to throw the vote when they switched back


[23-Oct-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	they know they lose if everyone voted for pio, problem is there are always a few thousand that vote con and don't look back, those few k are usually the swing needed to oust chem


[23-Oct-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Well we still have 3 days and we're only 4000 behind. We'll win!


[23-Oct-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**stohrm**:	What's the issue at hand and how can I help?


[24-Oct-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the issue is that there are currently only 15 people voting for the planet chem bonus compared to 26 people voting for the pioneer bonus, but because their bases are more established and have a higher worker population compared to the new people on this, a starter planet, and voting strength is based on worker population, those fewer players are still beating out the masses, even though a pioneer bonus would benefit far more of the planet's total player population.


[24-Oct-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, it would. But capitalism


[24-Oct-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	How do I vote?


[24-Oct-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	what level of license do you have for the game? free or pro?


[24-Oct-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I would say, or basic, but if you're that new, you wouldn't be there yet, heh


[24-Oct-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	pro via a game key (for now)


[24-Oct-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	ah! then you can vote


[24-Oct-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	so, you open the planet info for montem, and scroll down to infrastructure, and look for "Chamber of Global Commerce, and click that, and it'll show you the voting campaigns, where you can find the voting buttons.


[24-Oct-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	welcome to the game, by the way =)


[24-Oct-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Varlun**:	Feeling a bit of resentment towards the chem players. Y'all aren't welcome 'round here


[24-Oct-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	awesome ^_^ and thank you


[24-Oct-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and, yeah, var, it definitely sucks that there's almost twice as many people voting pioneers as for chem and yet we're still not able to compete.


[24-Oct-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I can understand that the weighting to account for fewer proportional workers per building for the higher tier stuff makes sense in some cases, but here on a starter planet it really does just mean bullying.


[24-Oct-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MajesticDefalt**:	classic argument rises whether a democracy or a republic is better, and it's always a time for sure


[24-Oct-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it took months to get rid of a 10% program here. its not bullying, it's just inefficient. Even though i only employ 160 construction workers, I will vote for that over pioneers any week


[24-Oct-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's only inefficient for the people at the top, but the people at the bottom struggle more to get properly started without any of that bonus that only the chem people get to enjoy up in their realm of making tens of thousands of ncc a day.


[24-Oct-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and there are just plain way more people at the starter ranks than there are established chem players


[24-Oct-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and not once have the chem players actually answered to why they have to be *here*, either, despite being asked multiple times.


[24-Oct-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	why a starter planet.


[24-Oct-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	pffft, yeah, sure, and how's that working out, lol


[24-Oct-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	bfabs are high, for now. but the go in cycles


[24-Oct-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	if there's more people clamoring for bonuses to their existing bases than there would be for that theoretical small amount of people who might see it and have some sort of lightbulb moment and jump into chem, then isn't that more important? I do not believe that you're forcing chem on this planet out of a sense of benevolence.


[24-Oct-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	if people wanted chem, they'd vote for it in greater numbers. they aren't.


[24-Oct-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**stohrm**:	How do we increase our workforce?  As that's your answer -- work together to increase each others workforce.


[24-Oct-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	what kind of building are you trying to make, stohrm?


[24-Oct-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	Barracks   so I can add both Pioneers and settlers.


[24-Oct-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	ah, I see. beginners tend to start out with just pioneer habitats, which is a much cheaper building to get the parts for


[24-Oct-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	doesnt mean its the better choice though


[24-Oct-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	and you need to choose the future ones, not the current one.


[24-Oct-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yeah, it first shows the list of past campaigns and the current one, and when you click on that, then it's a list of the different choices and their current support. the vote button doesn't give any confirmation step, but there's nothing stopping people from just switching their vote if they click the wrong thing, at least. =)


[24-Oct-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Kinda a meaningless exercise, they tend to stay in power until they quit, can't recall ever being a contested race.


[24-Oct-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Nah one of these months I'll pay them their $10, I need to upgrade my ships cargo size


[24-Oct-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there's double the voters for chem.


[24-Oct-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	whatever specialized (+25%) COGC runs, should get taxed more


[24-Oct-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but we can't make a dent


[24-Oct-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	*double the voters for pioneers compared to chem


[24-Oct-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I have a strict separation of my duties as governor and my agency as a player


[24-Oct-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and that's fair! I can't hold that against you. but the situation is still what it is, right? even just as a player I'd ask you to consider the needs of the majority.


[24-Oct-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I cast my non counting votes for chemi, more tech means more money.


[24-Oct-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I see the merit of this, but keep in mind that for the majority of Montem's history it has been CoGC pioneer, it's only recently shifted to chemistry


[24-Oct-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	the gradual shift makes me feel like it's been an organic tilt of Montem's industry rather than some sort of sneak attack


[24-Oct-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	That being said, it seems fair that Chem players should pay more tax


[24-Oct-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that's understandable, but compare that to the current situation of a nearly 2:1 voter ratio


[24-Oct-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	well sure, especially since their main reason for wanting it is making more money off of it


[24-Oct-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I do want to say, I can't fault you at all for wanting to approach it as rationally and fairly as possible, and I can't even say that I think you're doing a bad job of it. actually, it's refreshing to see that you *are* trying to keep things fair and not just play favorites.


[24-Oct-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there have been voting cycles with almost 40k votes on each side. The primary driver is not profit, as much as inter-base and MOR system optimization as a whole. Running PIO on a planet does little to help optimize MOR system specialization


[24-Oct-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as a new player with only one base, the vote for PIOs makes sense, certainly


[24-Oct-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Indeed, when you have multiple bases, hitting that sweet 25% bonus on each planet is a very big advantage


[24-Oct-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I would think that there are still more construction bases than chem bases, right? and even construction people were earlier arguing against a construction bonus because it would increase their input needs beyond what they are prepared to pay to supply

**Delcat**:	Chemi was voted in originally to pay the bill for planet upgrades, the cost to pioneer incomes was prohibitive


[24-Oct-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats mostly due to keeping a vertical stack base, where they try to both mine LST and make fabs on the same base


[24-Oct-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	There is a neighbouring planet to Montem, a very short trip away, the planet is named Danakil. Construction specialization is very popular out there


[24-Oct-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I suppose that can make a kind of sense, yes, that taxes on pioneer-primary bases would be crippling vs it not being as difficult to absorb for chems


[24-Oct-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I think this removed pressure for Montem to also be construction


[24-Oct-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	specializing into a horizontal base (and paying your LST extractor buddies well) is part of the horizontal specialization strategy


[24-Oct-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	sure, construction seems to have been more or less ruled out as a preference here


[24-Oct-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the choice does seem to be specifically between chem and pio


[24-Oct-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Opinions on a higher tax rate for chem, yay or ney?


[24-Oct-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I support (as an 90% chem base myself)


[24-Oct-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	LST is sweet here, but it has many uses, FEO is good not great, biggest advantage is proximity to the station, cheap staring production for new players, but not really the best palce for construction


[24-Oct-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	if, as delcat says, that was the rationale when it was first pushed to be switched to in the first place, I would think that that makes sense as a policy, that whenever pioneers might win sometimes, that's one thing, the new players can have a boost for a while, but if chem wins, they accept their intended role as being a primary taxation source? if I'm understanding the intentions correctly.


[24-Oct-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I don't think there was a rationale like that, it just sorta happened without a plan


[24-Oct-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh


[24-Oct-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	fair enough


[24-Oct-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	people just voted and one day it started shifting


[24-Oct-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but, that seems to be somewhat how things are unfolding, at any rate?


[24-Oct-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it doesn't change the upgrade or tax situation in any way that I'm aware of


[24-Oct-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there are certainly more PIO workers than Chem workers, and the tax rate should reflect the COGC in either case would be my input


[24-Oct-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and yes, delcat, I started as an iron base here, but it proved pretty terrible pretty quickly, so I switched to providing the lst for my corp, and my best friend started his base on vallis to ship over here for our construction guy.


[24-Oct-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I guess my memories are faded then


[24-Oct-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there might be more pio workers overall, shadow, but they're spread across a wider number of less-established bases with players who don't have the income streams to handle the taxes as well


[24-Oct-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and it keeps being pointed out that it's tier 1 stuff so is working with less money overall in the first place


[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	*best friend started his base to ship iron


[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	correct, so weighing a 10% tax increase on PIO bases hits a lot harder than a 25% increase on just chemists


[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	is the taxation equivalent to the % bonus? I haven't been around long enough to see taxes in action before.


[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or whatever the % amounts come out to


[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	the bonus and taxation has no relationship


[24-Oct-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Why would you tax PIO 10% more if it wins?


[24-Oct-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	how do taxes work, rubicate, do you set the amount? or is it just, on or off, a pre-set amount?


[24-Oct-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heck, what do the taxes even go *to* when you do collect them, anyway? :P what are they for?


[24-Oct-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I set the amount, but it's very hard for me to predict how much it ultimately brings in each week


[24-Oct-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	broadly speaking, a good way to fund the COGC upkeep is with added taxes to those who benefit from it


[24-Oct-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Opalesce, basically, everybody pays fees to run their production lines, these fees are sent to me weekly (with numbers so I know how much has been collected that week)


[24-Oct-22 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I spend that money on keeping the CoGC running, and providing upkeep for our planet's population so they don't leave the planet and leave us without a working force, and other programs such as festivals that helps keep some of the more complex workforce here


[24-Oct-22 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it's also spent on upgrading infrastructure such as a better Warehouse, but I run on a low government platform so I try to keep taxes as low as possible to run the bare minimum without many extra upgrades


[24-Oct-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and tbh, thank you for that in a general sense :) it's nice to not have what little profits we manage to make as beginners that we need to expand at all, taxed to hell and siphoned off while we're trying to get our feet under us XD


[24-Oct-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and really, that's the main argument I'd want to put forward in favor of there at least *sometimes* being a pioneer bonus versus *always* a chem one: that much more of a boost for beginners to get started, which can only strengthen the game overall as people don't feel discouraged if they struggle to ever get anywhere.


[24-Oct-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the game is better off with more people in it, right?


[24-Oct-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	on a starter planet, it's important to avoid an unhospitable beginning experience.


[24-Oct-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	It's a good argument, but unfortunately CoGC is outside the domain of the government, it's a citizen vote


[24-Oct-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if I had to decide as a governor I would problaby have set it as pioneer just to be neutral


[24-Oct-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	fair enough. =) I appreciate the reasoned debate on it, if anything.


[24-Oct-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I produce a wide range of products here, my production fees are wll under 10% of what I earn, their really a non-factor in my plans


[24-Oct-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	as in, you don't feel that taxes on you would be a detriment to you, del?


[24-Oct-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	am I understanding that correctly?


[24-Oct-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Nickels and dimes add up, but I spend 3 times as much for building depreciation compared to fees


[24-Oct-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and remember, an increase in the production fees is small, 10% on 43 NCC is only 4.3 NCC, while on Tech-based chem goods 25% is 270>337.5


[24-Oct-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	since higher tier workers are already set to much higher tax rates


[24-Oct-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	rubicate said that what the % of taxation on each type is, is not directly correlated to the bonus %, so there's no reason it'd be automatically 25%, I thought? .... wait, "already set to higher tax rates"? there's individual settings?


[24-Oct-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its not set, you can see them in the Local Rules


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	im jsut giving hypotheticals if they were implemented that way


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I see


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I can set a manual tax rate per industry per worker type


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	so I can increase Chemistry higher for example


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh interesting.


[24-Oct-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	it probably wouldn't be exactly 25% though


[24-Oct-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Planet rules, I see they're all the same rate now, not always so.


[24-Oct-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	we actually use a modified structure on Danakil for that purpose


[24-Oct-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	construction is 20% more than the other industries for that reason


[24-Oct-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	25%*


[24-Oct-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	keeps taxes lower for the other groups that dont benefit, lets the majority who constructs pay


[24-Oct-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	Pio & Set already pay the least, that covers 90% of the construction people. tech and above pay the big bucks


[24-Oct-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yup, most of the tax money goes to upkeep for the high tech workers so it's only fair they pay most of the share. We are doing pretty amazing on the high tech front compared to rivals such as Promitor


[24-Oct-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Promitor has an over-bloated PIO problem, where they cant actually sustain a high tier population since the pios drag down the happiness of higher tiers


[24-Oct-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	We invested earlier in some of the correct popi things too


[24-Oct-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	and fortunately a lot of engineer players settled here creating jobs


[24-Oct-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	Not being a long time player, but also not a new player. I would be switching my base here to chem if I could get a foot in vallis. shipping FE anywhere for construction is just a pain in the rear.


[24-Oct-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	When I was big into construction I quickly started digging all LST and buying my FEO


[24-Oct-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snook26**:	but for Danakil, you'd have to ship EVERYTHING in


[24-Oct-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	yep, different planet, different options.


[24-Oct-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	To me Danakil is a convenient close place for processing plants, the resources are okay, but you'll not get rich. I looked at it for several ideas, but never made that move.


[24-Oct-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	That's my main issue with Danakill as a const planet. I'd be shipping every little thing in endlessly.


[24-Oct-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SomeKnight**:	But my plan is to move down there and switch montem to Chem eventually. I'll just have to deal with it and get upgraded ships imo.


[24-Oct-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its a volume throughput thing. but yes, lots of shipping and big ships :D


[24-Oct-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	My plan is to get rich, by a resort planet, a sea side house and a nice little sail boat, nothing too big.


[24-Oct-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	This has turned into pretty interesting discussion of taxes which I hadn't even considered at all


[24-Oct-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So even as a noob with nothing but pioneers and income entirely from construction I can get behind chem as long as there are clear benefits to me from it


[24-Oct-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the notion that the chem folks would pay a tax rate reflective of their advantages, does make the idea of their voting wins, a little easier to tolerate, yes, at least provided that the taxes get used for improvements that the rest of us can also get a form of benefit from as well, which I'm sure would probably pan out decently well, sure :) I'd still like pioneers to win at least sometimes, but I don't see a reason why that doesn't seem like a fair give and take sort of trade off.

[24-Oct-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Delcat**:	After awhile acquisition of money gets kinda boring, you look for other things to do. 50k one way or the other doesn't count for much. A million counts, but it wouldn;t change anything.,


[24-Oct-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	For me its a lot still


[24-Oct-22 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	That's the fun part,, starting small and counting your profits to grow. There really is no endgame, you can add more bases, bigger ships. Buts it's just more work, not more fun. Maybe it's a whole new game with Pro license and an active corp, but forme


[24-Oct-22 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	5 bases is about all I wanna juggle, and money is just a number that gets bigger.


[24-Oct-22 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm a dirty noob - but the corp aspect was a game changer - way more interesting to have some communal goal


[24-Oct-22 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I'm dirty, and I'm cheap,


[24-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Me and my mate have a corp, and we just got a third to start playing soon so we'll start to get some kind of goal to work towards and hopefully expand from there. Maybe get to the point where we all make and consume each others goods so we dont need to use the markets apart from selling stuff we make


[24-Oct-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delcat**:	I play a couple different games, so I kinda drift in and out with this one. There are people have 10X what I got an did it in half the time. I play like what your planning, I make nearly everything I need, not as prfitable, but more interesting.,


[24-Oct-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	We might not go down that route though, I'm not 100% sure yet


[24-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-22 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Xiaphias**:	haha yes it is for faction contract, I don't know what those resources are

**Mordgier**:	noob trapped


[19-Jan-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xiaphias**:	I'll probably just decline the contracts and see if better ones pop up later


[19-Jan-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Just take the shipping stuff with an expiration date...and then...don't deliver it


[19-Jan-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Stealing from the NPCs is the true meta of faction contracts


[19-Jan-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xiaphias**:	lol! do you not lose faction reputation points for that?


[19-Jan-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You do, but would you rather have 100 BSE or 2 faction rep?


[19-Jan-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xiaphias**:	good point  : )


[19-Jan-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Be aware that not all shipping contracts have an expiration date and not all are prefabs. You could get STL or worse 200 MCG


[19-Jan-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You'd need to calculate the ratio of the shipment, there is a spreadsheet in the UFO discord for it

[19-Jan-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Also bfab prices will stay deflated regardless of FE, PE, or LST price. Until NPC contract piracy is fixed.


[19-Jan-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	When people pirate 70+ BSE from a faction contract it's kinda hard to beat their price when their production cost is "Wait a week to unwrap"

[19-Jan-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Looking for a stable LST & FE local supplier. DM me with your prices & daily quantities (or one time quantity) and we should be able to strike a deal.

**VLAD0153**:	How come on Montem there are Chemistry campaigns and not Construction/Metallurgy?


[19-Jan-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	Primotor is running Agri, understandable, and other main world is running Manafacturing, understandable


[19-Jan-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	only Montem is running Chem :D


[19-Jan-23 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FatKao**:	Thanks for reminding me to vote not-chem


[19-Jan-23 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Short answer, because it's more profitable to do so largely due to the CX location than anything else you can do here


[19-Jan-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'd much rather this place be anything besides chem but the only time chem loses on Montem is when the chem nerds sleep through the election cycle


[19-Jan-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Given that they lost one recently, they are wide awake


[19-Jan-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Be aware that chem nerds can pull in 30-40k votes when they aren't sleeping


[19-Jan-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	hah, tnx for explanation mate :)


[19-Jan-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Given MCG pricing and that the LST is "right here" making Montem a manufacturing world would make even more sense than construction...but  hey actually that'd possibly flood the MCG market so who knows how much I'd like that in the long run


[19-Jan-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	In that case MCG price would fall I guess...or if it would be profitable exported elsewhere and price would stagnate? dunno hard to tell


[19-Jan-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	but maybe construction would be better overall - more construction, more affordable prefabs, quicker expansion, quicker expansion more resources which means cheaper resources...


[19-Jan-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	MCG would have to fall to absurd levels to be not worth it


[19-Jan-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	dunno, to me good is not worth it as soon some other thing has better rate of profit

**Mordgier**:	Good luck moving SEA etc


[19-Jan-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Unless the dev do something about it (like changing recipes or something) there won't be a planet worth running low level Const but not Chem.


[19-Jan-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Thing is that if you start to talk about "worth" - then lets make everything electronics and make EDC and sell it to the MM and get quit out of boredom after a week


[19-Jan-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Because hey it's pretty hard to beat EDC in terms on ROI


[19-Jan-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But then if you just do EDC I guess you get so bored that the only thing that you can do for fun is mess with the H2O market...so yeah


[19-Jan-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VLAD0153**:	huh, I'm new and I have no idea why would anyone buy EDC, who buys it?

[21-Jan-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	is it viable to try to both mine your own resources and then produce items from them? It seems the starter game points new users to only 1 of those roles, but I'm just wondering if that's more of a logistical recommendation due to low resources a player starts with or if there are other roadblocks even after a few weeks of playing


[21-Jan-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	like would it take 2 bases, or could I theoretically have an extractor and a BMP in a single base? Is it the planet itself that reduces the output of 1 or the other preventing dual-purpose bases?


[21-Jan-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Specialized bases are better. If you never ever want to pay, you'll be limited in the number of bases you can have.


[21-Jan-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	Thank you for your response Yawnder.


[21-Jan-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	Is there a way to automate (or semi automate) the transfer/production of goods via contracts between my bases if I upgrade to pro? The contract system might allow for that if I could sign both sides of the contract with my different bases, but I'd wager a guess that isn't allowed/implemented?


[21-Jan-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You can't automate. There is no mechanism to do so, and if you were to make a bot (which is possible) it's against the ToS.


[21-Jan-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	ahh ok, I won't investigate that further then :P


[21-Jan-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	So to transfer goods, you either move it with your ship, or make a shipping contract (if you have PRO)


[21-Jan-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	and that's the "ads" I hear people asking for when they're making CX trips? A contract for them to pickup/ship my goods to my warehouse at the CX?


[21-Jan-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Yes. You can only make ads (on the LM, Local Market) if you have PRO.


[21-Jan-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You can ACCEPT contracts if you're BASIC though.


[21-Jan-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	ok cool, thanks again, I'll stop bugging ya now :)


[21-Jan-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	(Basic, not Free)


[21-Jan-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You can ask all the questions you want. Worst case I don't answer right? ;-)


[21-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The best way to "Do everything without the CX" is to join a corp. So corpmate can supply the LST to your BMP for example, while your farm corp mate supplies you with food want water and you pay them back in BMP products like OVE and PWO etc


[21-Jan-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	There are multiple hurdles to doing lots of things yourself, the number of experts you can have and the planet COGC focus.


[21-Jan-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Even if you are going against the COGC, you still are limited by the number of experts so if you are extracting and manufacturing, you at best can split the experts, but that's worse than having full dedication to a specific industry

**Jetic**:	any resources on how to analyse price charts for like 2-3 items? i started as a CONSTR and need to understand price movements


[21-Jan-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	What do you mean? They are standard candlestick charts


[21-Jan-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But trying to predict movements in this game is not really easy


[21-Jan-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A lot of the changes are from entirely unpredictable events


[21-Jan-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A player who produced a lot of a good quits - and suddenly demand exceeds the supply.


[21-Jan-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A different player sees the spike and 2 weeks later spins up a giant base - and floods the market and 5 weeks later the price is below what it was before....


[21-Jan-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So don't see a price going up and think that it'll keep going up forever


[21-Jan-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	As a constructor you only care about LST and FE prices really, maybe PE if you are doing BDEs and C if you're just making the PE in your BMP...


[21-Jan-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	In general FE has been stable between 350-450 and LST is likely on an upward trend due to a large producer leaving.


[21-Jan-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Right now if I was you, I'd be building extractors assuming you have pro.


[21-Jan-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	im saving up for my first extractor, building my own stuff for it and have 120 pop to spare for them


[21-Jan-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	i dont have a pro license, however, would i need one of them?


[21-Jan-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You need one to expand beyond a certain point and to trade directly with players.


[21-Jan-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	For example, I use a lot of LST. I try to buy it off directly on the planet to avoid going to the CX.


[21-Jan-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	If you were trying to sell your LST, you'd have to bring it to the CX, which means increasing your price accordingly.


[21-Jan-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Let's say you want to sell LST with 100 NCC in your pocket. If you sell local, you're fine selling at 100.


[21-Jan-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	If you sell on the CX, you will want 110 or 120 to pay for the transport too.


[21-Jan-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Now, let's say I want to buy LST and I'm willing to pay 120 for it. I'll either buy it for 120 locally, or if I have to buy it at the CX, I'll be willing to pay max 100 since I have to transport it.


[21-Jan-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	(The specific numbers I said are just approximate, but you get the idea.)


[21-Jan-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	By selling/buying on the LM, or in direct contracts, both the seller and buyer are winning.


[21-Jan-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	that all makes sense


[21-Jan-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	not to mention the 5h+ trip each way (if you were out of mats to run your plants, that'd be wasted time / lost money)


[21-Jan-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	unless you wasted fuel speeding it up ofc


[21-Jan-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	other than a couple extractors to become more self sufficient as a constructor, what else should i be looking into?


[21-Jan-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Try to slow your growth a bit initially to have enough credits on hands to buy 2-3 days of consumables at least.


[21-Jan-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	If you don't do that, you'll be wasting a lot of SF traveling back and forth every day.


[21-Jan-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	I feel like the 2 ships they give you let you have 1 always going from base, and 1 always returning from CX lol


[21-Jan-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	terrible waste ofc, but helps me sort things out for the first few days :P


[21-Jan-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You can, and I've done it, but it's easy to waste so much fuel doing that.


[21-Jan-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	i try to use as little as possible, but then run into issues of not having enough raw to keep factories moving


[21-Jan-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	I wouldn't do it again now that I've learned a bunch since the other day, but still a helpful thing. Nice of them to give ya 2 ships :P


[21-Jan-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Slow burn is great though.


[21-Jan-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	@Jetic: If you make on average 1000 profit an hour with your base, don't waste 2000 in SF to get there an hour earlier, even if it means your base stopped.


[21-Jan-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Won't be long till you are wishing they gave you three ships


[21-Jan-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	yeah my Prefab 1 is making like 216 credits an hour lol :p but i get the idea


[21-Jan-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prradox**:	are you doing the math on how much "per hour" after selling at the CX or is there a command I'm unaware of?


[21-Jan-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	i look at input prices, output prices then subtract the fuel costs at a slow burn


[21-Jan-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jetic**:	so 2 LST 1 FE --> product - fuel = profit


[21-Jan-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Generally, you take into account the consumables too (when assessing expansion for example), but for the burn rate computation you don't since they'll be consumed whether or not the factories are running.

[22-Jan-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Is this LST spike linked to Varlum leaving?  Clearly the loss of such a lot of easy to access LST is having a big impact on Moria industry


[22-Jan-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Varlun leaving and someone else announcing they'll expand here and use a lot.


[22-Jan-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	with carbon being high as well new players on Montem have multiple options for profit


[22-Jan-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Rubicate said he's going to get super stoned - I dunno what he's doing with the LST but apparently he intends to use a lot of it


[22-Jan-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I'm seriously considering destroying half my base and just build a ton of EXT


[22-Jan-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	100 days in that seems a retrograde step, step up to PP2 and you need PE/PG rather than LST

**Yawnder**:	I'm already full PP2 here, but you still depend on LST a lot


[22-Jan-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	As much as "a step back" it is, a full LST setup makes more profit, even when it was sub 100 than PP2s.

[22-Jan-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**OneTry**:	Now imagine LST @120-140 while FE @550-650 - when I started ... now sell those BBH @ 1500 and BSE @ 1250 ...


[22-Jan-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	Anyway welcome and enjoy, dont be afraid to ask o7


[22-Jan-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	As a new player...on Montem...it's a blessing


[22-Jan-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Just plop down an extractor and get paid


[22-Jan-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Funny thing is that right now, a full base of nothing but EXT would make more per day that my base does.


[22-Jan-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Yup


[22-Jan-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Thinking of moving my Const elsewhere and just making EXTs here.


[22-Jan-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah waiting on ship upgrades to be completed before I can abandon montem as my BMP production line


[22-Jan-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Can't exactly ship ~500LST a day right now


[22-Jan-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I'm mostly depend on LST+AL so unless I have two large ships, I have to be real close to either.


[22-Jan-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	But I guess I could also just upend and do something completely different, but that's another story.


[22-Jan-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I have 2 WCB upgrades on order but they are so backlogged I don't even have an ETA yet sooo


[22-Jan-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The funny thing about LST and Montem is that Montem is 'full'


[22-Jan-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you don't already have a base here and want to get into the LST production industry - you just can't.


[22-Jan-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Yup


[22-Jan-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I'm just not sure if it's worth it for me to switch for 23days.


[22-Jan-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Frankly I'll be shocked if the LST and MCG prices hold.


[22-Jan-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I expect things to go back to 120 for LST and 25 for MCG soon - I don't think the demand can support it


[22-Jan-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Even when the prices were sub 100, Varlun made it to more than million in less than 2 months iirc


[22-Jan-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I dunno what @Tubicate intends to use his LST for - but MCG is the highest volume user I can think of


[22-Jan-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	But ya, if I stop with my 250 LST / day, prices might go down a tiny bit.


[22-Jan-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A full size 1k base with 5 extraction experts right now makes 781 LST a day.


[22-Jan-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	(I already started making less LST intensive products to reduce the demand.)


[22-Jan-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So a full 1k size base makes ~100k/d


[22-Jan-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's not exactly hard to hit 1m doing just LST


[22-Jan-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But it's mindnumbingly dull - which is why he quit


[22-Jan-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Well, you can do other stuff at the same time.


[22-Jan-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	...Tubicate


[22-Jan-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Him and I literally had the conversation about "You got to do more than LST or it gets dull"


[22-Jan-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	The reason why I'll probably quit soon is that it gets boring. These mechanics would be fun, if integrated with other gameplay.


[22-Jan-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Sorry Rubi - uhh less than sober right now


[22-Jan-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I'm simply buying LST to make NS, BSE, and BBH. It's just in really big quantities


[22-Jan-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah and I suggested to Varlun that he should now take that 1m and do something...anything...and he just didn't want to because it was too much of a hassle.


[22-Jan-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The "hassle" though is the fun of this game.


[22-Jan-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	He also didn’t seem to want to run deliveries to support other manufacture / industry, most production needs regular deliveries to support it


[22-Jan-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I'm thinking of going back to X4. It scratches my production chain itch even if it's simpler, and there are additional mechanics surrounding it.


[22-Jan-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I've had multiple 100h savegames for X4 get corrupted - I'm not touching it again.


[22-Jan-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Wow. Never happened to me.


[22-Jan-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I plan on waiting for the next update with the Borons though.


[22-Jan-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Maybe they fixed it, egosoft games have been a minefield of bugs forever.


[22-Jan-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	What most fun specific thing in X4 for you guys?


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I liked X3 better soooo


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	X3 was indeed


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	@Rubicate - may we get estimate from how much by % or amount (or both) have your LST consumption changed?


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I like the X series because of the combinaison of production, empire building, semi-automatisation, ship capturing.


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	And why do you need/want to make own Bfabs/NS when you can just buy em all?


[22-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	The space combat is fine, but not the best generally I find.

[22-Jan-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	X games just suck up so much time.....I say as I play Destiny 2.....uhh


[22-Jan-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	The boarding in X4 is better than in X3 I find


[22-Jan-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Destiny 2? You mean the game that decided to remove content from player out of greed?


[22-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	do you rcmd any DLC/mods/webs?


[22-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I didn't dwelve deep in mods for X4 tbh


[22-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	so vanilla?


[22-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I have all expensions, but modwise, I don't recall


[22-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	are DLCs worth it?


[22-Jan-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ehh - the D2 content removal is overblown, the planets are just beign reused for other content - and nobody was playing it anyway. Warframe mayhave done it better by keeping it relevant but I'm not sure if I can really blame bungie for phasing out the original story that nobody would play through because - well why? It ceased being relevant years before it was removed.


[22-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	@OneTry: Not sure tbh. I never remember what is part of what.


[22-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	same here (for other games) - I like devs I buy it all / Patreon them


[22-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	@Mord: For anyone that owns only the base game, haven't they removed the 20-ish h campaign and replaced it with a 2h tutorial?


[22-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	until AAA - than I save money or exploit multidiscounts


[22-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The item vaulting is a whole different aspect and they did cut that stuff out - I'm plenty salty about the Saint 14 weapons being made entirely irrelevant


[22-Jan-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Correct - base game is gutted but you still have access to tons of 'free' content. You can fire it up for free and basically play everything but the campaigns which means strikes, and pvp but the campaigns and related quests require $ and the Forsakend and Red War camaigns are 'gone'


[22-Jan-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Yeah, well that is unfair I find.


[22-Jan-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I bought something, now I don't have it. It's not just slightly less, it's significantly less.


[22-Jan-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't disagree that it's not great, but I also can't imagine anyone installign destiny 2 today to play the original campaign


[22-Jan-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I know legally they're in the clear (most likely), but it's still an AH move.


[22-Jan-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I understand why they've done it, but they should have substituted it for part of their paid content.


[22-Jan-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	(for people that paid the game before it went F2P)


[22-Jan-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	or at least just offer smtg ...


[22-Jan-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	On that note though, I got to go cook freaking tofu... eeewwwwwww.


[22-Jan-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm absolutely not going to defend the greed aspect of it - they could at least have given folks who owned the base game the next DLC for free or at least a few season passes or whatever - but there are far worse bungee greed things - like buying season pass ranks and buying gear score upgrades for alts


[22-Jan-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	enjoy cheeeeeeese


[22-Jan-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So yeah, there was a good reason for why they had to do it, but they certainly could have done a better job of doing it in a way that didn't leave people feeling robbed


[22-Jan-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Anyway - I too am off to walk my dogs - go buy my hilariously overpriced MCG at the CX while I do so - thanks

[24-Jan-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	voting was very close


[26-Jan-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	may I ask what and why people vote for chemistry?


[26-Jan-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	what are they producing to make money through chemistry?


[26-Jan-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	On planet availability of h2o and Lst to make NS and FLX


[26-Jan-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	oh. that's more profitable than prefab production though? or just required in the bigger picture of their company.


[26-Jan-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	H nearby on OT-442


[26-Jan-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	hmm that makes sense then.


[26-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Depends on which prefabs


[26-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Only logic to put PP1 here. PP2 would be at celebdil.


[26-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	BSE? Thats what I do, I know its generic though.


[26-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	And yes more profitable than pp1's


[26-Jan-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	yeah


[26-Jan-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But I dont imagine full CHP bases here


[26-Jan-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Just did calc. NAB/NS prod isnt more profitable than full BSE prod :D


[26-Jan-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But CL production as around the same


[26-Jan-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	yeah, I checked too, my base produces specifically BSE and my pp is 29 days.


[26-Jan-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Did pp1 a long time her


[26-Jan-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	here*


[26-Jan-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	As I started here


[26-Jan-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Switched to chem as I needed the produce


[26-Jan-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Other planet close to MOR is Circe, and I already have a planet there and it doesn't have enough output


[26-Jan-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	yeah. flux production says 500 a day without chemistry boost, then with is 1700. that's insane now that I think about it.


[26-Jan-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	Circe looks good, Ill probably expand there in the future.


[26-Jan-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	But I think I will go to Etherwind first.


[26-Jan-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	For me its, CL feeding into TCL/EPO/PG then 3D plastics from the PG.  EPO/TCL goes to Danakil for RPrefabs


[26-Jan-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I'm currently only 750 area, but this gives 150k per day on PrUNner


[26-Jan-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	oh hm.  that makes sense. I don't have the money required to start any of that lol.


[26-Jan-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	A day!? wow mine says like 10k.


[26-Jan-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	8 CHP / 17 POP / 5 PPF / 1 LAB


[26-Jan-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	ty, I will take note of that if you don't mind. Those profit margins are insane.


[26-Jan-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	sorry that wrong 7 CHP / 15 POP


[26-Jan-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	oh. what is the colony cost for that? like 2-3m?


[26-Jan-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	1m 6.8 day ROI


[26-Jan-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	1m. wait, 6.8 payback period?


[26-Jan-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	just build a CHP or two, sell the CL to raise cash to buy more modules


[26-Jan-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	add 2 POP for each CHP and churn out PG/EPO


[26-Jan-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	ok thanks. rn I have 2 EXT 3 FRM 2 FP 4 PP1 1 INC


[26-Jan-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	I will have to sell stuff.


[26-Jan-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I originally had a BMP producing the MG to save some money, LST EXTs generated the starting cash


[26-Jan-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	ok that is a good plan, I might do that. POP being Polymer plant right?


[26-Jan-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	yup


[26-Jan-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Oh I used that same setup for a while with chp and pol making chlorine


[26-Jan-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	I sold those buildings to make a copper extraction base on another planet which makes more money than that though


[26-Jan-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	more money than I used to, not more than your 150k a day


[26-Jan-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	Nice. I most be doing something wrong. I am making 10k a day after playing for 3 months lol.


[26-Jan-23 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	please note I dont currently sell the PG and EPO, they get built into other items which I do sell.  But both EPO.NC1 and PG.NC1 give profits, EPO more than PG atm but PG was a better seller a few months back


[26-Jan-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I import everything


[26-Jan-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	its about 250T per day, I only have the 2 starter ships but I produce my own fuel and at 150k per day you dont worry about the burn rate


[26-Jan-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	huh. The PRUNner says a POL only makes like 1.1k a day making EPO though? Unless I misunderstood.


[26-Jan-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Do you have the CX set as NC1?


[26-Jan-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	yeah.


[26-Jan-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	Oh I didn't sorry. now it says 1800.


[26-Jan-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	JUI production says 73m a day lol. I think that might be a little off.


[26-Jan-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	EPO is 180/145 you make 50 a cycle.  Inputs are C (600) + O (80) + CL (2500) + H (100) say 3300.  Excluding paying the workers thats 5700/4000 profit per cycle depending on whether you sell at high or low


[26-Jan-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	make your own CL and the profit increases


[26-Jan-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	oh. I also looked. It leads into some really great production involving PP3 which I think I will end up expanding too.


[26-Jan-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	ok ty


[26-Jan-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	your right, EPO now says 6.5k a day.


[26-Jan-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	as I said, I use what I produce


[26-Jan-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MegaMango3**:	yeah. I have my business plan saved to PRUNner now, so I think I know what I am gonna do. tysm.

**VLAD0153**:	I saw you two speaking about shipping and thought about asking


[30-Jan-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	Danakil produces extra, but MOntem tends to run short due to the differences in H2O production: 2/rig here   4/rig there.

**stohrm**:	Once I'm done flying back and forth between HRT and Ant it won't be a problem.  But ANT has the INS I need and, yes, it was poor planning having both ships too far away at the same time.

[31-Jan-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dinglebop**:	@Rubicate why are you letting TEC/ENG/SCI happiness stay so low? I'd like to see at least a bit of growth if for no other reason than just "why not?"


[01-Feb-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	For the record I know it'd be hella expensive but it'd be fun just to see a megaplanet sometime in the future lol


[01-Feb-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	unemployment tanks happiness. can't grow much past 20% without people adding jobs


[01-Feb-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I say we just bomb the planet.


[01-Feb-23 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	even if u cap everything at 100% with fest3 you won't get a ton of unemployment. just throwing away money and on a planet this big it's a lot of money.


[01-Feb-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	we do need some fest3 running tho or we risk open jobs on techs+


[01-Feb-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Circe has far far far higher unemployment in every tier, but higher happiness though - and a greater raw number of each worker as well. It looks kinda fun to build just for S+Gs


[01-Feb-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I suspect Circe is getting a lot of Corp help to keep the grow going.  On the starter worlds its hard to get all the Corp a plot so a communal effort only rewards asmall part of the corp


[01-Feb-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	if you can find someone to max out the edu popi for no reason then we can get a little more unemployment


[01-Feb-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	for that to work you need the tier below to be much much higher pop than the tier filling up


[01-Feb-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Circe has about 5 of SNF's largest players contributing to it, not really practical to do on any other planet. I think Montem is running just fine as it is, but with all those PIO sucking up the POPI it's hard to grow higher tier pops too much here, not too mention it'd be rather expensive.


[01-Feb-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Since Scientist buildings are rather expensive, I suspect that there arent that many players who can actually use the workers in any case


[01-Feb-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	theres no a large global demand for chem sci. a handful of eep can supply the whole universe with gin


[01-Feb-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	1 uni could be nice to keep sci better but i don't think anyones been asking for them


[01-Feb-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Generally players rich enough to run SCI buildings could just set up their own planet and run their own government programs and CoGC, that's been done in a few places - not many would try it on Montem


[01-Feb-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The higher tier Chem is just Tech and Engi, mainly Tech for LAB's.


[01-Feb-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I doubt many would consider running SCI on an EEP, it overproduces by quite a lot and runs fine on just Engi - I don't know of anyone who even runs one permanently lol

[01-Feb-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	You never go back to free. You go back to Basic. But I think it's fine. Look at the license differences.


[02-Feb-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Well I assume they wouldn't lower you're HQ level because you already spent a lot of resources on that, and that determines your license count


[02-Feb-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gdSatday**:	yeah i meant basic lic. and confused description is 'permit to own' not 'to rise'


[02-Feb-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BeBopLula**:	Welcome, usually this forum is a little more chatty and always open to helping new players.  Hopefully you have watch the tutorials and unpacked your ship.  Build two pioneer habitats, and check which profession you choose to know which other buildings to build.  At the moment, both carbon production and limestone extraction are very profitable and you can do either even if you selected a different profession.  You can buy goods at the CX but you should rent a warehouse there [100 per week) before you purchase anything (if you don’t you may think your goods have disappeared, they haven’t but it’s a regular issue which can quickly be solved)

**Lib**:	I survived my first months with a couple of rigs, farmstead and a food processor. I was self-sufficient selling the surplus until I could expand. It might not have been the most efficient way, but I've never COLIQ:ed.


[06-Feb-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I was doing quite well until I foolishly sent both my ships off on long runs instead of keeping one in system.  I wish going pro also provided one with that much needed third ship, but it does not.

**Dr.Eggman**:	just so you know the rate at which you mine water and turn it into drinking water on montem is sower than the workers use drinking water


[06-Feb-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	you literally end up with less dw than you started with


[06-Feb-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	with LST as high as it currently is, anyone extracting O, H20 or FEO on Montem is just slowing down their own growth


[06-Feb-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	ya lst is the more profitable option


[06-Feb-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	i considered adding a colector on montem to give my friend on vallis O until i asked and was fglat told it was a waste of workers


[06-Feb-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lib**:	Thing is, I didn't have to send my ships away so often in the beginning when I was getting the hang of things, so I never regretted my RIG setup. Once I got enough money I expanded to Verdant and demolished all but one farmstead and one food processor on montem so I have C and COF there.


[06-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Talmar**:	If you don't care about your profit margin, then by all means, build farms and rigs here on Montem. But, if you actually WANT to expand quicker, then you should pay attention to the COGC, and try to use that production boost to your advantage.


[06-Feb-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You can play however you like but newer players have to have all options presented and if they are going to expand at a reasonable pace they have to be told O / H2O and FEO are not worthwhile on Montem


[06-Feb-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah frankly O and H2O and FEO here really feel like huge noob traps

[06-Feb-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NovamirTSE**:	do i just need to send my ship to the planet


[10-Feb-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You need to land on the planet, then press for fill.  Be warned that much contracts are not very profitable you are better doing contracts where you are asked to provide goods


[10-Feb-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NovamirTSE**:	ok thanks


[10-Feb-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I rarely take Exploration contracts: but my wife takes them all the time.  You have to weigh the reward(s) vs the cost(s).  For me, they are rarely worth it and usually out of my way.  For her: she (usually) only takes the ones with no time-limit; and they have Bfab's,  MCG's, or fuel as a reward.  Then she conducts them if they are within the route she was planning to take anyway.

[10-Feb-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	It's reset in the past as part of the development process and will probably reset one more time before full release, no idea about after but probably not


[10-Feb-23 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	well, it doesn't always have to be the *lowest* settings. sometimes you can get a reasonably worthwhile speedup for just a tick or two more than minimum, which is easier to be precise with picking if you widen the flight-planning screen. the way it was described to me when I started was, "as fast as you need, but as little as you can manage", which has served me well.


[13-Feb-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah "lowest" setting is bad advice really as fuel usage and travel time is not linear. Going min fuel may turn a 10h trip into a 30h trip all to save 500c of fuel


[13-Feb-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jankali**:	Yea, I saw that when messing with the slider. exactly lowest doesn't seem like the most economical option if it arriving sooner means you can quickly reimburse the spent fuel cost


[13-Feb-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jankali**:	(i.e. preventing a stalled production or supply shortage is likely worth a bit more than the extra fuel spent going a bit above min)


[13-Feb-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ideally you make as few trips as possible and with a full load every time


[13-Feb-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jankali**:	yeap


[13-Feb-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But early on you can't do that because you just can't afford to fill your ship with inputs


[13-Feb-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	so you end up in a dumb situation where you spend 2k fuel to sell 10k worth of stuff


[13-Feb-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JavierZamudio**:	Thanks! so this chat is only for this planet, Montem, right?

**JavierZamudio**:	Got it, tnks ;)


[13-Feb-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Top tips for starters on Montem.  Extract LST.  Build BMP to turn LST into MCG (buy SIO to do this).  Build PP1 to build PreFabs (you need to buy FE todo this).  Sell the fuel in your second ship for extra money (you don’t need two ships to start with)


[13-Feb-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JavierZamudio**:	Thanks a lot bro, i really appreciate it. Ill follow your advice


[13-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Look to sell about 50% of what you make to pay for fuel and comsumer goods.  Don’t use everything you make to build your own structures.  You will go bankrupt if you don’t sell stuff


[13-Feb-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	That said there is no shame in having to restart as you learn the game.  Most players have done this once or twice when starting out.


[13-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Also dont use too much fuel (initially) It takes longer to get to the CX but you then have more money to spend.

**munphfee**:	hi all, I am new there and I must admint that I am a bit lost. Can anyone help me to explain one basic step? I have built Rig to get water and Farm, but rig states it halted and Farm state that is missing water. How I could "chain" these buildings to set Farm to get water from Rig?


[17-Feb-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	all buildings work in a batch mode. it will take a while for each batch to finish - hours to days depending upon the batch size


[17-Feb-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	If the productuion says it's halted you probably don't have any pioneers. I'd wager you didn't build an HB1 building to house them


[17-Feb-23 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Look at the "Current Workforce


[17-Feb-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	"Current Workforce" column versus "Required" column in the Workforce Overview


[17-Feb-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**munphfee**:	Ah, I see now, I saw that I have 200 pioneers and I was thinking that they live in basic module, got it, now with the habitation module it started to work :) thanks


[17-Feb-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	Side note: Farming is going to give very poor returns on montem unfortunately and most would recommend you not


[17-Feb-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	right.... farming here is difficult because the water supply is not great


[17-Feb-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NovamirTSE**:	for population even if you aren ot using a building does it still take population /  affect efficiency if its not running


[19-Feb-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yeah it does, the workers sit around doing nothing but they still need food and the building is still worn down over time


[19-Feb-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	Hey guys, I've noticed we're boosting chem for a while, what's is that something I should be moving into eventually as a construction starter package who started on montem?


[19-Feb-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	yup but instead plan to support a construction base on danakil with a pol base on montem


[19-Feb-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	you can make a lot of money making epo/pg and upselling it as lse/rfabs


[19-Feb-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	okay I see, so once I get further in, might be a good I idea to swap from pp1/pp2 over to POL here


[19-Feb-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	Dont demolish your PP1s build like 2-5 PP1s to have cheap bfabs then move to chem - after 60 days demolish all but 1 PP1 after you setup Danakil base with 5PP1s


[19-Feb-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	oh yeah okay cool


[19-Feb-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	if you and I will be here after 60 days ... just beep me and ask for some help ;)


[19-Feb-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	yeah thanks :D


[19-Feb-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	just dont repair PP1s you have on Montem ... let them die-ing ...


[19-Feb-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	ah okay haha


[19-Feb-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	I was just curious why montem is where we do our POL


[19-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	yup focus on CHem on Montem


[19-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	but dont go SET/tier2 route before you have lets say 100K avalaible


[19-Feb-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	I mean you can but its better have some $ spare and being mroe familiar with how things work here


[19-Feb-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	yeah I didnt plan on it, was going to go up to 5 pp1


[19-Feb-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	after that - maybe 1 POL, if it works after a week 2nd one, now save money and 2nd base on Danakil ...


[19-Feb-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	cool thanks, I'm at 3 pp1 now, so it still might be a while, but great to know


[19-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	10PP1 4PP2 on Danakill, 4POL on Montem;; demolish Pp1 Montem there you go ur 40-70 days ingame :P


[19-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	and POL on montem is not related to the resource we extract here right? its just nice to be near the cx?


[19-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	LST to FLX


[19-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	gotcha gotcha


[19-Feb-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	wait! I meant 3 CHP before going POL!


[19-Feb-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	Haha I was just about to ask if CHP should be thrown up then


[19-Feb-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	POL are great but you need to have 2+PP2 to make em ...


[19-Feb-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	yeah


[19-Feb-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	and supplies for workers AND !!! BUIs for like 14-21 days ...


[19-Feb-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	which is $$ in the end so .. 40-70 days :)


[19-Feb-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**idksoidoagainlol**:	cool


[20-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**idksoidoagainlol**:	how many active players like actually playing this game?


[20-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	there are 266 online right now and considering the kind of game this is, the number of active players in the economy is probably at least 3x that


[20-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	the number on the bottom right is players logged in at any given time


[20-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**idksoidoagainlol**:	this game has a lot of waiting :(


[20-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	I've seen some people estimate the amount is like 10x average players online, that sounds a little too much to me but could be true


[21-Feb-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	It is quite easy to fill a base full of consumables (10-30 days worth) and login just 1x week or even longer.


[21-Feb-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	If you have not experienced using recurring orders (a PRO license thing) I highly recommend it.

[21-Feb-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	@Opla...  Yep, no way I'm typing that all out.  Anyway if you just switched from free to pro and have not logged out and back in the repeat button shows up but seems not to work.  Just close the game down and then go back into it.


[21-Feb-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	They also say you should do that if the icon in the upper left corner is constantly spinning.


[21-Feb-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I find that it always spins after I rearrange items in the queue if I do it by moving them and not deleting and re-establishing them.  Seems glitchy to me, that it should be that way - but - it is what it is.

[21-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	is it the recurring contract, or the recurring production order, that isnt working for you?


[21-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	contract.


[21-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ninjanomnom**:	that's not implemented


[21-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	right, which is why I was surprised that I thought they were saying they'd used it, I didn't realize they meant production because I've been pro so long I forgot it was even an extra feature.

**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	onetry, that's a bit obnoxious?? maybe they just changed their mind on what focus to start with.


[11-Mar-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	no need to toss out judgments like that and make people feel self-conscious


[11-Mar-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	especially new players


[12-Mar-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	if someone changes their important decision after 47 minutes - welp yes I can think and talk about it


[12-Mar-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	ur more than welcome to encourage them like I do, to "spam" those tutorials like I do - or even more often and better ones


[12-Mar-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	They prob just another one of those people who saw "free game" and thought it'd be easy to get into


[12-Mar-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	could be - "found out" that "there is no game, just stupid web"


[12-Mar-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	also one can argue why would they COLIQ ... instead of just leave

[12-Mar-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, being rude/toxic to new players who may not understand how to play is not the way to go about it, especially if the game is to grow

[12-Mar-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Lots of people answer any questions that appear, not just him. And the game literally has a tutorial section that you can access

**NTPerdurabo**:	rgr. thanks anyway


[13-Mar-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you can buy things and ship them over but its not worth sending your own ships for that


[13-Mar-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NTPerdurabo**:	i kind of overexpanded too early on. i guess


[13-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Theres a currency exchanger command that you can use. pretty sure its not a pro feature


[13-Mar-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	is is definitely PRO feature.


[13-Mar-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Teriside**:	Does failing NPC contracts hurt your reliability score? I am gonna have to let a few go lol


[14-Mar-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	yes, if you accept it you are at risk for losing the amount of faction points the reward gives, i believe


[14-Mar-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	ah okay, but not the stat that effects your ability to trade on the LM


[14-Mar-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	that's just your PRO/BASIC license status


[14-Mar-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	Well, there's a reliability stat on your company


[14-Mar-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Mar-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	okay


[14-Mar-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	but it shouldn't tank your stat


[14-Mar-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	well im about to find out in 20ish hours


[14-Mar-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	eh you are at A so you'll be fine


[14-Mar-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teriside**:	yeah nah I was just curious, I doubt it would that much, I think it was a system they had put in place for "pirates"


[14-Mar-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	you can earn it back pretty easily


[14-Mar-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BeBopLula**:	my plan is try to condense at source, so 280d (which we are both located on) converts TIO to TI to AST to cargo bays.  I then just ship cargo bays back

[18-Mar-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you can do that with the other 3 currencies that are not NCC - rent a warehouse at other commodity exchanges (CX) for 100/week, then buy low and sell high there


[18-Mar-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	in addition to actually shipping the goods yourself, that is

[10-Apr-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GroovyGuavaGuy**:	Hi there, if I take a shipment contract, is it possible to split the shipment in two? I need both of my ships to be able to deliver the contract.


[10-Apr-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	unfortunately, no, you can't split an existing shipment to divide between ships. but what you *can* do is try to contact the one who issued the contract and ask them to take the shipment back and divide it into parts you can carry in multiple trips. it's an easy mistake to make when you're still learning, but definitely one that you should try to remedy with the contractor up front, because if the contract expires, while you still have the shipment, it doesn't just go back to them, it becomes that in effect you accidentally stole the items, essentially pirating. which I'm sure is not what you're trying to do. just, try to contact the person, explain you're new, not a pirate, and that you'd like to fix the situation. most of us will be understanding and cooperative. =) good luck


[10-Apr-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	(unless you didn't take the contract yet and were just asking to check *before* taking it, which I guess you might have been doing)


[10-Apr-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GroovyGuavaGuy**:	Thanks for the clarification - I haven't taken the contract yet, wanted to ask beforehand. I sent a message to the contractor to see if they are willing to split the contract in half.


[10-Apr-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	awesome. ^_^ good luck on that then!


[10-Apr-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Tardwrangler**:	What is everyone producing that we have Chemisry as the specialty on this planet?


[25-Apr-23 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, it's a bit of a long-standing debate here, really. as it's a starting planet, it's meant to be able to specialize in construction and building parts, particularly given the limestone supply. so the specialty for most people here would be best served as either construction or, even better, pioneers. however, the limestone supply is also attractive to more advanced players who want to use it for chemistry, a more advanced industry not generally affordable/accessible to the many newbies that end up here. however, the higher workforce voting power of the few chem players, ends up overpowering the many more players who'd vote for pioneers, but aren't as established so don't have as much voting weight.


[25-Apr-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I doubt they're doing the LST chem production line as its not very profitable. Ideally we need more of the newer/non chem players to start voting more so we can win COGC as either CONS or PIO


[25-Apr-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it does seem like a lot of people have gotten demoralized about endlessly being outvoted by fewer people, and they stopped bothering to vote at all mostly.


[25-Apr-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	"what's the point in bothering to vote, we're just going to lose to the more advanced players anyway" kind of thing


[25-Apr-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there used to be a lot more people who voted each time, there's very few left who vote every time like you and me


[25-Apr-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	We dont even need many people if we can max them out. I'm sat at 2740 workforce/influence with a maxed out PP1 base. If we can get more of them maxed out, then we have a higher chance of winning it back


[25-Apr-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and yeah, I'm at my own max workforce potential too, at full extractors.


[25-Apr-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	You know what, I'll put it out there:


[25-Apr-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	If any new players want help building their bases up to max workforce/population, especially construction starters, let me know and I'll help you out with cheap bfabs (and mcg where possible) to help you get built up faster so we have a higher chance of winning COGC


[25-Apr-23 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The only way we've dethroned Chem COGC in the past was with last minute ballot stuffing


[25-Apr-23 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it wasn't ballot stuffing XD valrun had just quit so they didn't realize that they didn't have the numbers to win


[25-Apr-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tardwrangler**:	kek, just like politics in real life! Iron Law of Oligarchy


[25-Apr-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	They do though - if they all vote


[25-Apr-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The next week they easily crushed pioneers


[25-Apr-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Valrun quiting helped but it wasn't key


[25-Apr-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	they crushed the next week because they realized their "mistake" and rallied together to make sure we couldn't win again


[25-Apr-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I can toss 3600 votes around but it deosn't do anything if the chem crew is aware of a close run and they'll just post in UFO discord and folks will wake up and vote


[25-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	5k is only 2 more people though, and thats the difference currently. I know someone I can convince to help vote PIO who should have 2.5k ish when his base is fully built up


[25-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	"currently" sure but that's not the voting pool


[25-Apr-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	iirc chem has hit nearly 40k before


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Sounds about right, not seen it that high in a while though


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	right now they're only barely bothering because they don't have to


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah cause a bunch of us stopped voting


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	FatKao and I just haven't bothered and we were 7k combined


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well FatKao quit so anyway that's also a GG


[25-Apr-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	they discouraged so many of us from voting anymore that they can get away with winning with only part of their numbers


[25-Apr-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh, he did?


[25-Apr-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah got his ships upgraded made a fuel base and got bored


[25-Apr-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh no XD


[25-Apr-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Its a shame, the CONS/PIO vote helps new players out so much, we really need to try and win it back


[25-Apr-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yeah, it's never felt fair that they hoard the benefits that are meant to help new players on a starter planet, just because they can.


[25-Apr-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but we literally haven't been able to do anything about it.... because, they can.


[25-Apr-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I feel like starter planets should be locked to a certain COGC, or limit it to relevance (PIO, CONS, MANU, etc)

[25-Apr-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	newcomer here, definitely voting Chem


[25-Apr-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Chem is totally relevant here


[25-Apr-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	thing is, at this stage in the game, there's a good probability that most people here have been here for a long time, and they have moved beyond Pio's. Chem is a good field, and easily achievable, even by newish players


[25-Apr-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	But Montem is the CONS start. It always has been and its not changing. It will help new players way more if it went PIO or CONS rather than CHEM


[25-Apr-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and it's not like the natural flow of all the players here should be to migrate from other initial industries, to chem, like, as some kind of default pipeline.


[25-Apr-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, imagine if all the bfab producers here suddenly upped and redid their bases as chem bases. The bfab price would skyrocket from a lack of local production

***jamieara** left.*


[25-Apr-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	it might affect bfab prices but we have 2 constructor worlds here [danakil and iiron?] and they rely HEAVILY on the availability of pg/epo/tcs/nr to produce L R  H and A fabs so you would see a price dip in the mid and high end fabs


[25-Apr-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EatTacos88**:	Anyone have 300 MCG they could spare for a rebuild? I'm basic, so if you could send a contract that'd be amazing!


[25-Apr-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Thats even better then if we got a price dip. Montem is a construction world 100%, not chem. Else ask the devs to make this the chem start planet


[25-Apr-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	its the only chem start planet isnt it?


[25-Apr-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	danakil is a start construction planet


[25-Apr-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	when i started here i did it specifically because it was chem and thats what i was interested in doing


[25-Apr-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	No, Montem is not a chem start. Its the Construction start. Just because its a starter planet with Chem COGC, doesnt make it a chem starter planet

**Bant**:	Also, hello. o/


[25-Apr-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	More B-Fabs are built on Vallis now than here on Montem. The difference won't be that much


[25-Apr-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	The reason there isn't a chem package is because you need Settlers for it. It's the next step of development


[25-Apr-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I doubt it, Vallis is a smelting planet, most people there will be making FE/AL. Montem is still the bigger CONS planet in the system despite those in power forcing it to be chem


[25-Apr-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Calyst**:	thx man


[30-Apr-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	i guess montem was the best you could do for starters


[30-Apr-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	and i am sure we could benefit each other from time to time :)


[30-Apr-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	since i do not produce FE myself


[30-Apr-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Calyst**:	when i was lookin at a planet i just checked to make sure it had ore and called it good lol


[30-Apr-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Well if you are on montem you are on the best according to the spreadsheet for metalurgy i suggest you check out prunner


[30-Apr-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	it is a third party tool that lets you plan out your base there you can plan out your base expansion


[30-Apr-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	i personally will stick with my simple stuff for starters and just make it bigger over time


[30-Apr-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	cause BSE scales quite reliable from what i can tell

**Dr.Eggman**:	if you post on local market it will get filled


[03-May-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I don't have pro either :/


[03-May-23 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's why I asked for a CONTD


[03-May-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	youll have more luck buying the stuff yourself and posting shipping ads on moria


[03-May-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	which you can do as basic


[03-May-23 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh really? never knew that I can post shipping ads on moria


[03-May-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Thank you thank you thank you you're a lifesaver xd


[03-May-23 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	A shipping contract is an LM ad, which can only be accepted with Basic, not posted


[03-May-23 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I believe players on Basic can post on the CXs. Have seen it before


[03-May-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	ok I will look for confirmation on that ... two people saying it is convincing


[03-May-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Tacos is on Basic but you'll find his shipping ads on MOR


[03-May-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I have no way to test directly and the web site say no, but player experience trumps the web site


[03-May-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Usually from Prom/Danakil to MOR


[03-May-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	ok thanks for the correction


[03-May-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	np, good to know for the day we go to basic :)


[03-May-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yeah right ... basic worked ok for a while early on but I can't go back to basic again I don't think as long as I keep playing now


[03-May-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I just read the discussion about it in the global chat, DogeConomy didn't like the disconnect between the web site and the actual rules and complained and posted a bug report about it


[03-May-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	but he did also confirm that it worked

[03-May-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	so i cant post there that i want montem to danakil


[03-May-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	all good info thanks


[03-May-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	... Why are people suddenly nuking Montem's COGC


[03-May-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	its not sudden


[03-May-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	theres a very angry faction of pioneers who hate chemikillz lol


[03-May-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I normally don't like it when COGC changes I would vote for Chem but I got no people here yet ... lol


[03-May-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	slapped in the base when the opening popped up and I have no other materials here yet


[03-May-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	hey atleast you got in thats a rarity


[03-May-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	ive been trying to get a vallis base for months


[03-May-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	down to +9 ... who knows


[03-May-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(fyi my consumables order from earlier has been filled, don't worry)


[03-May-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	You mean a faction of normal people who want Montem to return to a PIO/CONS planet like it should be? Its literally the Construction starter planet for new players


[03-May-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Well that'd mean I'd have twice the output on prefabs, since I already have a base on Danakil :D


[03-May-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Chem is also good though


[03-May-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Vallis is also technically the starter planet for construction so that argument doesn't really work


[03-May-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Montem is the sole starter planet for Metallurgy too - am I tripping or is it just that the handbook hasn't been updated for a while


[03-May-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	The latter, as Verdant isn't on the list of planets


[03-May-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(which is my starter planet)


[03-May-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	theres iiron for construction and danakil you dont need all the starters to be construction


[03-May-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	flux and nutrient solution have been nuts for a few weeks now and you want to cripple the few players that still make it


[03-May-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^ (What I'm doing rn here xd)


[03-May-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	making flux


[03-May-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	my montem CHEMICAL base supports my danakil construction base my qq-082 agricultural base my gasworld fuel base and my celebdil metalurgy base. all utterly reliant on produced chemicals


[03-May-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think Vallis is a better starting planet for Metallurgy, higher FEO concentration and of course COGC is Metallurgy


[03-May-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	although construction works well on Vallis, it works even better here with the LST on location


[03-May-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	but once it's Chem and I construct my base around that I don't want it to change, also I am here for a Chem base which I now need so yeah I'll be voting for Chem


[04-May-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	is there anyone who wants to sell me some RAT's?


[04-May-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How many do you need?


[04-May-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	about 200


[04-May-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ok that's too many and I can't spare them. Perhaps better to buy on CX and ship it in


[04-May-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Just you and An0nym0us from what I know


[05-May-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't make LST anymore.


[05-May-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I tore my extractors down months ago because it was way cheaper to buy and let me have absurd volumes of MCG production


[05-May-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But yeah - I burn through as much as 550 LST a day sooo


[05-May-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Anyway if someone wants to make LST or does make LST - I need it.


[05-May-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Also if you're a noob - I will give you prefabs to produce LST for me


[05-May-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	I got 5 extracters, but only make about 100 LST per day


[05-May-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-May-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-May-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-May-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Get used to it


[09-May-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Unless you can sneak it via last minute vote spam, you have no real chance of flipping it


[09-May-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I hope we can. It will help new players out a lot


[09-May-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So what you do is you group up with a few people, you all vote chem, last minute you switch all your votes to pioneer.


[09-May-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	There are a LOT more people who can vote for chem than there are voters.


[09-May-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Most just don't bother to click to vote


[09-May-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Exactly, so that wont work. We just need more people to vote who understand that its more beneficial to go PIO


[09-May-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It will work if you don't give the chem folks any time to notice the vote swing


[09-May-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's how I and FatKao flipped it to POI before


[09-May-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Just the next week there were like 40k chem votes sooo


[09-May-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	The difference was that we got a lot of people to vote PIO, CHEM was 30k-40k for about 7 weeks, a few weeks before and after the PIO vote, it wasnt a swing vote at all


[09-May-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Not the time a few months ago when it went PIO anyway


[09-May-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	Why do we have to assume that most people in favor of chem are only out for themselves? All this talk about sneaking a flip seems pretty deceptive. Whats wrong with going to these chem players and just asking nicely? Is that not possible?


[09-May-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	lol


[09-May-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	They wont, theyre capitalists


[09-May-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	And its a badly weighted voting system


[09-May-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A PIO win costs some of these players more per day than you have assets with your 20d playtime


[09-May-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	Have you tried? It never hurts to ask. The worst that could happen is they say no. But not asking will absolutely get you nothing.


[09-May-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah, I've tried before but you either get ignored or laughed at


[09-May-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Exactly Mord, literally capitalism


[09-May-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Last I checked a POI win for me is like an extra 500k/week but for a lot of chem folks the loss is far far more massive


[09-May-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	Capitalism isnt denying people business. Have you tried offering something that they might need in exchange for a temporary sway in vote?


[09-May-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	yeah, but I can guarantee that they need the cash far less than you and I


[09-May-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Dude - what are we going to offer them? A hand job?


[09-May-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	MCG is probably the only thing that PIO logically make here that would make sense, but thats dirt cheap anyway


[09-May-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yup and for that I'd prefer manufacturing


[09-May-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's what I do here


[09-May-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Exactly. A PIO win wont happen unless we get an influx of new players going pro and some of us that vote PIO  helping them out with cheap stuff


[09-May-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	I dont know what you'd offer them. But you could find out something they need produced and help them produce it. Who knows, they might be on par with that kind of deal. But you have 3 bases, so it should be difficult to find something they need help with. Thats how you make friends with sharks dude.


[09-May-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	Shouldnt be difficult


[09-May-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Good luck then.


[09-May-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	guess you want no part in that. suit yourself


[09-May-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	BFAB prices are very overpriced currently so thats even more of an issue for new players


[09-May-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	We arent saying we want no part in that, but theres literally nothing that we make that they would want


[09-May-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You do not grasp that there is nothing we can offer to a chem player that would be worth them losing the bonus.


[09-May-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's a pointless conversation - because you fundamentally do not understand how valuable the COGC is to them


[09-May-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Apart from 1m to every player per week or something, but then we lose out even more


[09-May-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Exactly.


[09-May-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	And 1m is probably understating it


[09-May-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Actually, as a 25% bonus, its probably about right


[09-May-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapski**:	You could find something they need help being produced, they could send you the resources to produce it, and in return for helping them produce something they could agree to sway their vote.


[09-May-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Like what? Most of what they consume either isnt from PIO buildings, or you logically wouldnt make it here


[09-May-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	There is nothing you can give them that'd offset the loss


[09-May-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Even if you offer them the entire set of prefabs to make a base on some other chem planet - it ain't that interesting - as they want the CX proximity


[09-May-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	A super quick check on prunner shows they can clear 700k per day being maxed on AMLs


[09-May-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Not certain if the global market could absorb that much AML output


[09-May-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Probably not, but we're talking about logical CHEM profit per day/week


[09-May-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	And yeah, 1m is pretty much the 25% they gain from COGC so its not worth it for us to bribe them, it'd cost more that we get out of it


[09-May-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I guess I'll chime in.  I'm a pretty new player, certainly not one of the super rich that you're talking about and I just started a base because of the Chem GOGC.  I understand it's been flipped but it is an attractive planet to do chem on.  I'm sure you could pay me something to vote otherwise but I'm not overall interested because I moved here specifically for chem.  Just wanted to show there is a middle side to this too


[09-May-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	It just that its not what the wiki and official guide states though, that Montem is a construction and manufacturing planet. Thats why PIO makes more sense as it helps more people out, especially new ones


[09-May-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah but really I think that's just one of the oh so many flaws in the new player experience


[09-May-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't think it's a fair argument to say that chem players should bend over and make this construction because the new player start suggested it


[09-May-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	They took over the main construction start so its now harder for new players whilst chem players are making excess money for no reason


[09-May-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I dunno dude - with the current BSE prices...I'm not really shedding tears for construction start


[09-May-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Look at the FE prices...


[09-May-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	And LST prices


[09-May-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	FE is finally where it should have always been.


[09-May-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	LST is stupid but guess what - this is where you can get it


[09-May-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	FE was stable at 380-400 for months


[09-May-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Its not


[09-May-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you think FE is great to make with good margins - go for it


[09-May-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I was going to but Vallis is full


[09-May-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Run the numbers - at 400 FE was not worth the hassle


[09-May-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	LST prices are an abomination but anyone doing construction here will yank it out of the ground or buy it locally


[09-May-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	so - not shedding tears for them


[09-May-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Honestly, its for the Carbon price looking at it, thats 90% of the issue


[09-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	C and FLUX prices and the shipping weight have screwed FE producers


[09-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's by far the most painful start imo


[09-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I mean, you cant make more than a 3000/1000 ship can make in 1 day


[09-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you have a 3000 size ship you're doing something more profitable than FE anyway


[09-May-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Not if you extract your own FEO


[09-May-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I meant that in response to my previous message


[09-May-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I think the wiki and the guide should be more clear about them being suggestions or maybe they should make the map viewable before choosing a starting spot but the fact that so many have found this planet attractive for chem and flipped it a deeper game mechanic that I actually enjoy, makes the universe here more flexible and in motion


[09-May-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm honestly indifferent to whether Montem goes PIO or Chem, as I'm more interested in self sufficiency rather than minmaxing and "watching the number go brrr".


[09-May-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	i mean noi matter what industry you want to be self sufficient in you need chem in there somewhere


[09-May-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Expert boosts are good enough for me


[09-May-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	im self sufficient in construction food pro and fuel and metalurgy and i need my chem base to support all of them


[09-May-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah it depends


[09-May-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	tbh danakil should be a more flexible planet since it has chem, construction, manufacturing, metallurgy and farming resources (albeit not all industries are good)


[09-May-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that way we can focus the CoGC votes towards the most profitable industry every week


[09-May-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	= more money for those that like number go brr


[09-May-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	whoops meant "montem" instead of "danakil"


[09-May-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(as you can tell, I spent more time there compared to here, or even my starting planet- Verdant xd)


[09-May-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	i personally chose montem as my start because of it being chemistry


[09-May-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	as a side point, pio bonuses would let lst extraction go faster, and make more, which would presumably help bring down the cost of it for everyone else who relies on buying it.


[10-May-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Not so sure there


[10-May-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You'd make it faster, I'd use it faster


[10-May-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I have not one but two regular lst contractors I supply that I've been struggling to keep up with, I won't name names but I know who they are, and I'll just point out to them that I'd be able to fill those faster if I could make it faster.


[10-May-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	*but they know who they are


[10-May-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	*snerk*


[10-May-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	my point is no less valid though. I'd still fill them faster.


[10-May-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	keep up better with both contract sets, maybe end up with extra, and I have a set lst price point (personally) for when I sell to the LM of 130, regardless of the current crazy high price, so if I had extra, that's what I'd sell for. 130.


[10-May-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**HansFlamme**:	Hey can somebody maybe lend me 100 NCC? i miscalculated a little


[11-May-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Thank you very much i shall repay you by the end of the weekend @Resistence is Futile


[11-May-23 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	keep it


[11-May-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I am forever thankful!


[11-May-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	The issue was that i overlooked the productionfees cause they only get subtracted once the job gets activated


[11-May-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	quietly amused that HansFlamme is Triple A rated!


[11-May-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Well i keep doing all the faction contracts^^


[11-May-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	That does factor in, i also did a few hauling jobs that were on the way


[11-May-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I am now in a state where i am able to buy enough food/Iron for a week and wait for my ships to fill up with BSE and Limestone or the odd shipment aswell


[11-May-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I just gambled a bit with my last purchase and forgot to send my selling shipment on the way in time hence why i was low on funds, a 100NCC was literally the only thing i was missing to keep my BSE Production going


[11-May-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	And honestly i do feel proud about that


[11-May-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	The ratings i mean, i can´t wait for my payday to get a pro licence


[11-May-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	cash flow is king in this game, but keeping a BSE factory running at the start of the journey is very important


[11-May-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Yeah honestly i might max BSE out on montem or maybe divest in FLX or CA to make something off the excess limestone


[11-May-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	i have no plan beyond that though at the moment


[11-May-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	then again just having the Basic licence i have not yet looked into ship building


[11-May-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	cause the base ships are really not that great in my opinion


[11-May-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	well even a MCB.NC1 cargo bay upgrade will set you back 500k, you will find that burning more fuel to go faster is a necessity before a ship upgrade or even a new ship purchase


[11-May-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Wow i did not know that


[11-May-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	and may i assume it would be even more expensive to build the kits?


[11-May-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pord**:	can anyone on Montem sell me a single BTA? lol


[11-May-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I can make you one probably let me check


[11-May-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Anyone got 50 PE?


[11-May-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pord**:	dang i did i just sent it to the CX lol


[11-May-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I'm certain there is someone out there who will have the BTA before you can make it


[11-May-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Sure i was just offering


[11-May-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	unfotunately its not me


[11-May-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	on the issue of ship building.  Useful cargo bays use alloys.  AST.NC1 and FET.NC1


[11-May-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pord**:	im going to put up an ad for 1 BTA


[11-May-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pord**:	3k


[11-May-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	but you also need a LFE.NC1 plus some hull plates


[11-May-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	The FTL is only needed for jumping though


[11-May-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	currently the price of alloys is a lot lower than I usually sell cargo bays for so if you had the money to buy the alloys you could build cheaper than buying


[11-May-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	i was kinda thinking of a sub light bulk shuttlle to replace the starter ships


[11-May-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	SLT-only ships have very limited scope


[11-May-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Yeah true, but i do not need FTL for picking up stuff from montem to the CXL at the station


[11-May-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	they are a lot cheaper and free up your starter ships to do FLT shipments


[11-May-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Exactly!


[11-May-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	but to upgrade your starter ship to a larger cargo bay needs an FTE


[11-May-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	sorry LFE


[11-May-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Yeah that makes sense i kinda wanna keep them in orbit and maybe use them for explo contracts till i am close to settling a second planet, but i think having a sub shuttle for my BSE and LST would be handy and save on the wear on the Starter ships


[11-May-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you can see the typical upgrade requirments here

[18-May-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-May-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	thanks for your service rubicate youve been governer longer than ive been here


[19-May-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Agreed - you've had a great tenure. Big shoes to fill once you're gone!


[19-May-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Oh man - I best actually bill you for the MCGs


[19-May-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Burned out?


[19-May-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I don't think I will last as long as you did before needing a break.  At some point I will do the same and try to minimize the cost and let everything go dormant so I can come back if I want to later.  It is already feeling a bit like a chore sometimes.


[19-May-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I've hit my 6 month "middle-age" in PrUn.


[19-May-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	205 days almost to the end of what basic can do idk that ill still have the motivation to fight the paywall


[19-May-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I couldn't adjust myself back to basic at this point and remain active.  And agreed, even if you can work around the queuing limitations and two ships only, you are stuck at HQ5 permits and can't grow anymore so you are mostly just maintaining operations and collecting money without pro now.


[19-May-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	not as fun as having growth targets and objectives


[19-May-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Miszczu**:	ahh it takes a long time to do anything


[24-May-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but just let it do its job and do something else


[24-May-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but given you have a 8 hrs old acc you still have a lot to explore


[24-May-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	or you can find other polish people :D


[24-May-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-May-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Alblaka**:	Hmmm... I'm a bit confused reading Montem's PORP: Education is on single-digit % levels, yet, we got an influx of 190 Engineers from education?


[30-May-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	Education in Need fulfillment is different from "actual" education, I'm pretty sure

**Zaltarish**:	Damn I chose the food farm path x)


[05-Jun-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	on montem food?


[05-Jun-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Indeed


[05-Jun-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	umm thats not optimal


[05-Jun-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	verdant is very good here for that


[05-Jun-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Damn it I didn't know..


[05-Jun-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	also you did the tutorial bcs its pretty pointless to explain everything if there is the tutorial


[05-Jun-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Is there a way I can move?


[05-Jun-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yes but first


[05-Jun-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Yeah I did a bit of the tutorial, rn I am supposed to build my first habitat... though it says I don't have enough resources


[05-Jun-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I will keep that in mind, thanks!


[05-Jun-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	or reschedule your build materials


[05-Jun-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and make a manufacture or prefab plant and sell the goods on the cx


[05-Jun-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and buy what you need for that


[05-Jun-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	what does CX stand for?


[05-Jun-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	the trade hub where everyone can trade


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	"commodity exchange"


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr got it


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Sorry to  ask you but


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yes?


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Could you tell me how I can build my first habitat?


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I click construct as the tutorial told me but it says I don't have enough resources


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	click on a new buffer


[05-Jun-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and type BS


[05-Jun-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
***V.O.J.tech** deleted this message.*


[05-Jun-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	construct


[05-Jun-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and there will be a list of buildings to build


[05-Jun-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(also first select the base you have)


[05-Jun-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr but It says I miss all the resources


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	in this case you can type: BS OT-580b


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	did you build the core module? then you probably need to unload your stuff from the ships into the inventory of the planet. Dunno if you can build with resources that are in the ship cargo


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I just unloaded but I still didn't buold the core module ig


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
***V.O.J.tech** deleted this message.*


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I clicked build a base


[05-Jun-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	How do i check if I have a core?


[05-Jun-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	yeah, that is the core module, it gives you some cargo space


[05-Jun-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	type: PLI OT-580


[05-Jun-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and there will be a button on below


[05-Jun-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	in the buffer right?


[05-Jun-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yes


[05-Jun-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	If you already build the base it says 'View base' instead.


[05-Jun-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but you can move to verdant if you still didnt build the basde


[05-Jun-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	bcs montem isnt for food :D


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	That is true


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	sadly i made the core here... but it says i can still dismantle


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	you might you dont lose anything in the first hour or so


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but wait


[05-Jun-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	How do I load back stuff on the ship tho


[05-Jun-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	does he get back the cm? bcs idk remember if it only gives back 100 mcg or the cm too


[05-Jun-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	FLT into a buffer


[05-Jun-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	click the cargo


[05-Jun-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	open base inventory


[05-Jun-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and drag


[05-Jun-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(the stuff into the cargo buffer)


[05-Jun-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr done


[05-Jun-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Should I risk it and demolish the core?


[05-Jun-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	so do you get back the cm if you dismantle?


[05-Jun-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I've read before one hour you get everything back


[05-Jun-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	the materials you get back are shown there


[05-Jun-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	please tell me again how do I check the core


[05-Jun-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	If you dont get everything back, let me know what you end up missing and I'll send you some stuff, if you have pro/basic that is


[05-Jun-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	nvm


[05-Jun-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	it says


[05-Jun-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	100 mcg


[05-Jun-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	That is not good, you need more stuff to build a new base than just the mcg...


[05-Jun-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	so i guess stick to montem - either try suboptimal food - or pack everything trade down in the cx for stuff you need


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	DAMN IT :cry:


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	My recommendation: try a few days and if it does not work out, you can restart with the command coliq. But I would stick with it for a time.


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I should've looked more but


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I cna try to manage


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(but you can use this command WITH CAUTION: coliq)


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	f you want to reset everything


[05-Jun-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but first find a suitable place


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Is there a way I can make another base in another planet in the future?


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	where you want to restart and what you need for that


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yes


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but that will take 40-50 days


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	to get there


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I think it would be lowkey better if I just start on a better place cuz this game looks hella complex and I am new x)


[05-Jun-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	unless... you get someone to fund you


[05-Jun-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	wait a sec


[05-Jun-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr


[05-Jun-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	For now I will stick here for a few days just to try out the sim

[05-Jun-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@Zaltarish: I would recommend to try stuff first if you want to restart anyways you can learn the next steps already. While Montem is not optimal for food it does work.


[05-Jun-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	this should be clear enough


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	What's this?


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Oh


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	nvm


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	got it


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Alr imma try this place


[05-Jun-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Imma try to build the habitat now


[05-Jun-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i have 3 bmp-s and 2 wpl-s as of now on montem :)


[05-Jun-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but chem is better as the cogc bonus applies to it


[05-Jun-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I literally have no idea what yu guys are talking about but I hope to learn soon x)


[05-Jun-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Built my first habitat


[05-Jun-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	No worries, you will learn but at first it is a bit overwhelming.


[05-Jun-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Yeah with all these text it does appear overwhelming


[05-Jun-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	and with the buffer... damn


[05-Jun-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	How much water should I que on my first rig?


[05-Jun-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	as of now I build all the recommended starter buildings


[05-Jun-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Hmm, as I paid for pro I would say minimal and recurring, but you don't have recurring (which reschedules the order). So I guess you plan how long you want to sleep between sessions and queue enough that it still works once you are back.


[05-Jun-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I will look for some more advanced tutorials online later


[05-Jun-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	For instance, I don't know how long an water order takes on Montem, but let's assume 7h and you are away until tomorrow same time (24h) and you have two rigs. I think you can queue three orders at the start


[05-Jun-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I only have one rig  and it takes 9 hours


[05-Jun-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Vut I qued like 4 orders as of now


[05-Jun-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	OK, how long is your queue (the free squares below queue)


[05-Jun-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	nine hours and 25 minutes for  square


[05-Jun-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	and 2 free squares


[05-Jun-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	4 orders will take 9hours*4, so 36 hours. You are fine if you look tomorrow again.


[05-Jun-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I also started uhh the FP and the FRM


[05-Jun-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	the FP is making DW and it takes 3 hours and 23 but  needs 10 water, should I make another type of food?


[05-Jun-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	you should have gotten materials for a recipe of RAT (rations)


[05-Jun-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I see a lot fo recipes for rat


[05-Jun-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I dunno which, can you look into your inventory: do you have GRN or MAI?


[05-Jun-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	only GRN and no MAI


[05-Jun-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And the second one is either VEG or NUT? I assume VEG. And you proibably have BEA (beans).


[05-Jun-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	should I use my water to make some mai?


[05-Jun-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	6 veg 6 bea but not any NUT


[05-Jun-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	OK, so your RAT-recipe is BEA+VEG+GRN


[05-Jun-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	It is the last one in the list for RAT.


[05-Jun-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	it is


[05-Jun-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	You need one of each and produce 10 RAT of it. You already have RAT and DW, because your workers will eat that stuff each day.


[05-Jun-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Since I have some DW for like 7 hours, should I make 2 RAT (it takes 8 hours and a half)


[05-Jun-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	so I can just come back tomorrow


[05-Jun-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	You make 20, 10 RAT each time you make a recipe. And yes, you should fill your queue with orders big enough that your workers have to do until you are back online.


[05-Jun-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	alr got it


[05-Jun-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And when you have queued the FP, you can fill the farm with stuff you need for RAT. So if you wanna stick with the same recipe you need BEA, VEG and GRN. You can replace GRN with MAI, or VEG with NUT if you want, works the same, but needs different amounts of water to grow and different time.


[05-Jun-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	For Mushrooms and Algae (MUS or ALG) you need a different building and I that is not that easy for a starter.


[05-Jun-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Good thing about RAT and DW is, everyone else needs that stuff too, so you can sell it.


[05-Jun-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	I will pass for that until I get a base on a better planet


[05-Jun-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Ph got it


[05-Jun-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaltarish**:	Imma cue my farm for things for my FP


[05-Jun-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	yes, that is recommendable.


[05-Jun-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Mnementh**:	As you play free, your only option for trade is the CX (Commodity Exchange). The nearest CS is on Moria Station in the same system as Montem. You load the stuff you want to sell on your ship (open the base inventory and the ship cargo and drag the items around) and fly the ship to the station. Then there you can set the items on sale.

[06-Jun-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	you could buy a smaller amount than that if you want


[06-Jun-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Yeah, I know, though I already got some limestone, enough for my current production, and I'll need my 15k NCC for consumables and stuff


[06-Jun-23 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	If I had the spending cash id stock up for sure though

**Alblaka**:	Alright, after some deliberation, I'm hereby announcing my candidacy for the Montem governor position. SWHY's a mid-level company with a focus on Verdant-based consumables industry, and I admittedly only recently moved into Montem to begin with, and I have no experience governing planets whatsoever, but I'm pretty decent with excel spreadsheets, and are *way* too active in the game for my own good.  So if you vote for me, you'll get:  - A young, inexperienced, upstart, but also very motivated and active governor  - who'll spreadsheet the heck out of the planet's finances to ensure that POPI needs are exactly where they need to be, with the minimum of taxes required to finance them  - A focus on ensuring that the planet has the necessary workforce of technicians & engineers to reliably support mid-tier industries (not sure we need scientists here, yet)  - A public referendum on whether a welfare program should be established that funnels tax revenue into providing <90d companies cheaper


[06-Jun-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(Also, do feel free to check out the Montem channels on the UFO discord, long, formatted texts are WAY more readable there)


[06-Jun-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I'd vote for you atleast


[06-Jun-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I'd vote for you I have no idea what's going on but I'll do it :)


[06-Jun-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@SolarAspect The previous (and long-term!) governeur of Montem, Rubicate, has announced that he'll put down the office and will not run again. Governeurs manage a planets POPI (population infrastructure), that is responsible for generating your workers, paying for upkeep via production taxes and such. All players with a base on a planet get 1 vote (with elections being held every months or so) to pick who should be the next governeur.


[06-Jun-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	If you make production taxes lower @Alblaka I'd be so happy, already buying commodities is really expensive, and production cost isn't helping at all


[06-Jun-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The voting is done in the ADM center of Montem (ADM OT-580b). You can also bring up the screen by opening up the Planet Info (PLI OT-580b) and then clicking 'Planetary Administration Center' at the bottom. The election starts in 2 days.


[06-Jun-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Alright. I will most definitely vote for you if you promise to lower production taxes collected by the Montem Government!


[06-Jun-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I can't promise you a production tax cut without knowing how the planet's internal finances look like. I'll also point out that production taxes generally make up ~1-2% of your overall production costs. Slightly more for primary industries (i.e. LST extraction). But yes, consumable prices for T1 are way too high. That's what my last policy point is meant to adress. It's not an issue for older (or even mid-players like me), but if you're just starting out, RATs @ 130 is a lot of bound capital.


[06-Jun-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I started a week ago, and I'm really liking the game, but you know, everything is so expensive! To get a good offer on the CXL, I have to pay highest bidding price, and it's taking all my money >:(


[06-Jun-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I know you probably cannot change anything about that but any lower in taxes and production fees would be greatly appreciated.


[06-Jun-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	@Alblaka I second SolarAspect on this one, lower production taxes would be great


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Yeah, I know you cannot promise anything, just saying it would be nice.


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Alright, thanks


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Yeah, what they said


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's very important that the governor can sustain the POPI, even if it takes a slightly higher tax rate.


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Dang if this becomes the Skyblock Dante situation Ima quit this game


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It'll take some time for the new governor to hit the sweet spot balancing the books (if it ever gets balanced). Most governors lose money trying to keep the POPIs filled fyi.


[06-Jun-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm good with spreadsheets, so I'm confident I'll able to build myself a robust calculation for that (I suppose there's solutions online that I might draw from, but at this point I'm rebuilding and customizing community-available sheets anyways). And, even if this might cost me a vote or two, I'll also say that I'm straight-forward enough to raise taxes if need be to cover the expenses. My company isn't big enough to just casually run the planet out of my own pocket (beyond maybe the initial transition phase), so I'll need those taxes to match the expenses, one way or another. Should probably check in with Rubicate as to whom he's been buying POPI supplies from, to keep costs low.


[06-Jun-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But ye, my first priority is maintaining POPI equilibrium. Getting re-elected is secondary to that economic stability.


[06-Jun-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(said the guy who isn't even elected yet XD)


[06-Jun-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	As I said, I can't promise tax cuts (as classic a cliche that would be), without even knowing how the planet's balance looks like. The first priority is making sure that the necessary POPI levels are maintained (so that the workforce doesn't run off). If there's a surplus of taxes beyond that, I can see about lowering the taxes.


[06-Jun-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	@SolarAspect produce food so it can be cheaper :D


[06-Jun-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(i mean if the food is high that means not enough people choose this path... or the game isnt balanced)


[06-Jun-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The problem is that the higher tier players can pay 200 for RATs without noticing a thing. So they will. Which means smaller players are hit with higher costs, to the point where the only sane move is that *every* new player just start with a agri base to make their own RATs. But that feels like a rather limiting solution.


[06-Jun-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i know


[06-Jun-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i mean the only thing keeping it from that is the price limit


[06-Jun-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(also selling energy systems and softwares doesent help as the money inflates)


[06-Jun-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I wonder if removing the MM for RATs would fix that problem, or make it worse. Because if suddenly infinite RATs @ 165 are no longer an option, older players would need to at least partially invest into agri bases. But as is, you'Re financially better off printing EDC or some other high tier product, selling that to MM, and will make more money and thus be able to buy RATs at any price :/


[06-Jun-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	exactly :) those mm-s are the issue


[06-Jun-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	for the high tier products


[06-Jun-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(hmm unless we did make 2 different currencies for high end and low end)


[06-Jun-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	then that would be interesting as you wouldnt be able to print out so easily the low tier currency


[06-Jun-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(but everything is more compley than it looks so idk)


[06-Jun-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(but to be honest i hate the solution of mm-s)


[06-Jun-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	like if its well balanced you dont need to generate stuff from nothing


[06-Jun-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I think MMs should simply adjust their pricing. The more you sell to a MM, the less it offers. The more you buy, the more it charges. It's good that basic items are always avialable to be spawned 'by the faction', but that shouldn't happen infinitely at fixed prices.


[06-Jun-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(bcs the factions arent fluid (unless its starsector :D ))


[06-Jun-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but if its viable high tier products will always fetch higher raising the prices to the next level


[06-Jun-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(also this is... a cheap fix that wont solve the problem long term)

[06-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	There's just not a big enough player base to have the market solely supported by the player base. There are high tier items that no one would build the factories for if they couldn't sell them to the MM


[06-Jun-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	So bots sell the higher tier items?


[06-Jun-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Or it's prestocked?


[06-Jun-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no, only we make the items. The MM only sells the bare necessities. Like RATs and DW, some B-Fabs, Fuel, etc. Everything else needs to be made by an actual player


[06-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	What do you mean


[06-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	bots dont sell any high tier items


[06-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	So iff there is some random item nobody has ever made and nobody needs, nobody will make it? And it won't bne sold on the CXL?


[06-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Not sure I can make that any clearer. Read it again


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	oh


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	nvm then


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	What's an MM


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	IDC.NC1


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	that


[06-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	(look at the order book)


[06-Jun-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	market maker


[06-Jun-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well in that case tier one production is pointless :d


[06-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	MM is a Market Maker. It's put there for people to buy or sell, usually for basic necessities, or for high tier items, to drive people to make them


[06-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	so you cannot lift the disadvantage from new players


[06-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	what disadvantage?


[06-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	tier one is a necessity. Everyone needs those, new and old alike


[06-Jun-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I make a LOT of money selling RAT's and DW


[06-Jun-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	indeed thats true


[06-Jun-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but if you want to start anything else then you are at disadvantage


[06-Jun-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	how so?


[06-Jun-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	disadvantage to what?


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	as the high end producers can afford to pay a lot more for basic food and dw


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	how is that a disadvantage?


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	the prices are up


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	ya so you make more money selling it


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(unless you make rat or dw then you profit :D )


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	high end producers had to start where every new player is.


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	then produce that which prices are up


[06-Jun-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	of course there's always one start thats better than the others


[06-Jun-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yes but the market was different at that time


[06-Jun-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	sure enough


[06-Jun-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i just wanted to point out its useless to try to avoid that


[06-Jun-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	market is always changing, and prices are increasing across the board


[06-Jun-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	didnt read anyone who said they want to try and avoid prices moving :D


[06-Jun-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	thats the whole game, supply, demand, prices, all that


[06-Jun-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(yes inflation but the mm-s for rat and low end products remain)


[06-Jun-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	back when I started, H20 sold for around 15/u. RATs sold for around 40, DW sold for around 30


[06-Jun-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(i didnt say i wanted i just wante to make it less forced)


[06-Jun-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	the MM helps keep things within limits


[06-Jun-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but then its not simulated enough


[06-Jun-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	our player base isn't large enough for that


[06-Jun-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	li know but still just a fixed price seems... not as the right solution


[06-Jun-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	again, our player base isn't large enough for that


[06-Jun-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	although i guess we are still in alpha


[06-Jun-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	so... i wont complain more :)


[06-Jun-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but what can i say ive been here only for 100 days :)


[06-Jun-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(its already a hundred... time in this game seems to be disconnected from the real world even though it isnt)


[06-Jun-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i wonder if they will ever extend the chart to contain 360 days :)


[06-Jun-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	MMs are an absolute necessarity at universe start, but their fixed-price nature becomes a distorting factor at some point. We also can't really NOT have MMs for higher tier products, or there would be no real developement. The game needs some kind of goal that isn't just capital, that incentivizes production of high tier goods. I could imagine Elite Dangerous style community events would work. Devs hold a semi-RP open forum on galactic issues, the community decides to build a new CX, the devs put up a list of high tier goods needed to complete it and add a basic contribution menu for that inter-planetary project.


[06-Jun-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yeah that seems good though again not really afressing the starting players


[06-Jun-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but i would say global research ould ve interesting as you need a lot of coperation to get it done and it unlocks new features/buildings


[06-Jun-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The aid for the starting players lies in not allowing large players to freely print money, whilst giving them something else to do. Global research would be interesting, too. Unlocking new buildinds and recipes, and then being able to sell licenses for that technology, as it slowly ticks up to become commonly available. Allowing mid and late game players to focus on RnD bases to get an innovative edge, without making research strictly mandatory, nor excluding non-corp players from meaningful competition


[06-Jun-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The alternative to minimizing inflation (or incentivizing deflation) would be to progressively increase the player starting capital... I'm not sure there is much else that can be done, mechanically to aid new players in finding a footing in a well-developed economy. Except player-driven actions, such as providing newer players low/no interest loans, cheaper consumables etc.


[06-Jun-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Dang, I really wish there was a higher playerbase for this game. It's really interesting, but most people don't have an appeal to spreadsheets and business thinking, llol


[06-Jun-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	And that would help fund more development for this game!

**Talmar**:	Getting the Devs to make a whole new area of the game is a pipe dream. We've been asking for some very basic things for YEARS, and we still don't have them. Basic things like a Governor Wallet, for planet Govs. Been 3 years PLUS we have asked for this, and still nothing. Corp Warehouses, so Corps can help out their new players. Nothing. Corp Wallet, again, so the Corp can help out new players, or help with Corp Projects. Nothing. The list goes on. And Nothing. But they spent a year making the Map all pretty! And you still can't search for a specific system or planet in it. Great Job.


[07-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ye, I've started to regret my supporter purchase as well. The developement speed of the game is atrociously slow. And then the feature prioity selection goes to fancy maps or leaderboards, instead of day-to-day QoL featurs like customizeable or recurring contracts. And then the recent info that a dev is leaving the team... bleh. Twice as frustrating because the core gameplay idea is plain and simply awesome.


[07-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Doesn't mean it's not fun to debate potential solutions for game problems though, even if there's the underlying understanding that likely none of the soluions will ever be implemented, and it takes players actively breaking industry chains 'to prove the point' just to get the devs to start tweaking mechanics.


[07-Jun-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	ok so you say we need to break the game first (i like this idea)


[07-Jun-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well they probably wont do it but imagine a pole to vote on the next stuff to implement


[07-Jun-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	such is the unfortunate life of a niche game with only part-time devs working on it


[07-Jun-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	hmm i wonder how much this game makes as revenue...


[07-Jun-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but probably not enough


[07-Jun-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	getting the number wouldn't be impossible, since there's only 1 consistent revenue stream, just needs a lot of data collection for who currently has PRO


[07-Jun-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i mean thats... not impossible but hard to get


[07-Jun-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(like idk how would you count that)


[07-Jun-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	probably just a poll that gets extrapolated to the scale of the playerbase


[07-Jun-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but its niche - kinda like a sandbox thats very slow and production based


[07-Jun-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	it wouldn't be 100% accurate, since people who are more involved (more likely to fill out the poll) are more likely to have PRO


[07-Jun-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Talmar**:	The Dev that left was in charge of the social media aspect of the game. I don't think he did any development or coding, so him leaving shouldn't impact game development.


[07-Jun-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Where did you find that info?


[07-Jun-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	info on what? The Discord has been around for a long time, most people know about it. And the Handbook is right on the site


[07-Jun-23 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	ohk sorry im new to the game

**Alblaka**:	@Talmar: My concern is that devs, even community managing ones, don't usually leave small projects, since those are innately passion, not money projects. But obivously that's just me speculatin pessimistically.


[08-Jun-23 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	With the upcoming election vote starting in just a few hours, I wanted to let everyone know that if I get voted in to office, I guarantee a tax drop for CONS, MANU and EXT professions, in particular for PIO workforce to try and help the new players with better profit margins. Hopefully then they will be more likely to survive with the current consumable prices and stick with the game for longer


[08-Jun-23 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So the rumors I heard on Verdant about the other Montem candidates trying to push Montem away from Chemistry COGC *were* accurate after all :P


[08-Jun-23 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'll also take the liberty and point , on the example of a BMP, that even a tax drop from the current 43 NCC to 0 NCC would not actually do anything to help newer players: A BMP, per day, costs 43 NCC in taxes and >1200 NCC in consumables. So even if you promise a tax nullification, you're barely suggesting a 4% cost saving *without* even considering inputs. I appreciate the motion to support newer players, but I feel like mini-percentage tax cuts are just a way to sound like you're doing a lot, when in the end you're changing almost nothing :P


[08-Jun-23 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Maybe it wont do that much, but any savings for a new player stacks up a lot. We cant change the CX prices at all, so cutting production costs is the best we can do here. Plus, the more bmp or other building they have, the more they save


[08-Jun-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Well, as I've outline in my policy promotion, if elected I'll hold a referendum on setting up a fund for providing <90d players cheap access to T1 consumables, paid for with planetary tax income. Even just undercutting CX by 10 NCC/RAT would be a far more impactful saving then zeroing taxes.


[08-Jun-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	See, the difference if that you want to hold a referendum to decide things which could get voted against. I plan to actually make changes which will help out new players that dont have pro/basic. For those that do have pro/basic, I can provide cheap bfabs at cost which is way more beneficial


[08-Jun-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what about a public donation/VC (venture capital) pool?


[08-Jun-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(not related to what was just said)


[08-Jun-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Theres no real way to track that ingame though. Sure, spreadsheets will work, but that relies on trust and someone (or multiple) to actually keep track of it


[08-Jun-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you cannot provide free players with anything. They can only buy from the CXs. And dropping the tax for PIOs is pretty much pointless. Saving them $43 a day is almost pointless, even for a new player. And you need to generate revenue to put to planetary upkeep, which will help everyone. Unless you are going to be paying for these out of your own pocket, which I doubt you will.


[08-Jun-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^ 100%


[08-Jun-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	$43 per building per day, so it stacks up. And I could pay for it out of my own pocket, I reinvest what I make into making my bases bigger (obviously), but theyre big enough that I probably could support POPI and stuff out of my profits


[08-Jun-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I would've ran the appropriate calculations multiple times before making such claims


[08-Jun-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ye, the difference is I suggest action that will *actually* have a *relevant* influence on new players, but are aware that it's a bold proposition that I don't just want to dump onto people and tie to my election, which very well may just end up a coinflip anyways. You say "It's just a referendum, I promise to actually do something" but that doesn't change that your 'do something' isn't gonna have a relevant impact. As I said, do you intend to null taxes? <1% saving on expenses (once you factor in inputs). Do you intend to merely lower taxes? Even less impact than that. You're talking about sums so small they aren't even relevant to a freshly started company.


[08-Jun-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Your idea will only help pro and basic players as free players cant private trade, meaning you cant supply cheap consumables to everyone


[08-Jun-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the benefit from new players would be negligible once they expand enough for the <1% to compound over time


[08-Jun-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@Talmar does raise a good point though: Even if you provide cheap RATs to newer players, that won't at all help FREE players, who can only access CX. But I haven't found a reasonable way around that, because to drop CX prices for consumables, we would essentially 'just' need to start up a new planet's worth of agriculture... that's not exactly something within the scope of a governeur even. So I'm focussing on those I CAN actually help, in a MEANINGUL amount.


[08-Jun-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Yeah investing capital into a FP planet would make more sense


[08-Jun-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Yeah,I will null the relevant taxes for PIO, and drop them a bit for SET which will help, even if you think it wont. Its a guaranteed price drop for all  cons/manu/ext players, not just pro and basic like with the idea you suggest


[08-Jun-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I think it would be a bit wild to make a key point of a governeurship on one planet, that you'll invest in another (agriculture) planet... but Doge isn't wrong that it would kinda be the most effective approach. Maybe I'll tinker with that for next term.


[08-Jun-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	*aka, the term after the one this election is about.


[08-Jun-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I would've tinkered with that but unfortunately I have limited cash on hand (in game and real life, no point renewing PRO when in the middlegame grind) and so I can't just straight-up build a ADM and necessary infrastructure by myself alone


[08-Jun-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I run at like 5-10% profits per week due to my heavy discounting for in-corp members


[08-Jun-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Doge, the issue isn't only FP, but mostly agriculture. You can drop FPs on any planet, and there are plenty of FP worlds with free spots. But therer isn't enough agriculture (if the constantly rising prices for agri products are any indication). And HYF-worlds are so wildly inprofitable, most players just go for a regular green starter planet in a different faction instead, and import the produce.


[08-Jun-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	HYF's aren't too bad right now


[08-Jun-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	compared to the price you'd pay for produce on the CX


[08-Jun-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	With 40/u water prices, I'd be careful :D


[08-Jun-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Checking (poor man's way of CXM):


[08-Jun-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	VEG.NC1 BEA.NC1 GRN.NC1


[08-Jun-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	holy smokes grains at 498 NCC?


[08-Jun-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Nah, that's a spike


[08-Jun-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah I know


[08-Jun-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Wow, they scalped GRN..


[08-Jun-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just kidding, probably due to faction contracts

[08-Jun-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	That 500er GRN price is wild. FRM-GRN with ROI 2.5d. Though I don't expect that price to hold very long. It's just too arbitrarily high.


[08-Jun-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah GRN should drop sooner or latter


[08-Jun-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*later


[08-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	If you want to lower food prices, you need to lower H2O prices. They are connected at the hip. The higher water rises, the higher RATs will rise. There's no other way around it. When water was 15/u, RAT prices were 35 or 40. In there somewhere.


[08-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and HYF's are crazy efficient. They put out twice as much, on half the land. Just need lots of water.


[08-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	The RAT price increases were due to lack of supply to begin with weren't they?


[08-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	people were switching to more profitable FIM.NC1 recioes


[08-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	now MEA.NC1


[08-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, I've been making all 3 forever. People always follow what's selling big, and try to switch up to take advantage of it. Then when it crashes on them, they get all mad


[08-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	But you can't drop down your RAT prices when you are paying through the nose for the water you need. It's still linked


[08-Jun-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	There's no way we're going to ever solve the RAT.NC1 or BSE.NC1 problem with demand like this and tons of players auto liquidating every day


[08-Jun-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Montem's queue is a fine example of this


[08-Jun-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	It's all about the player base, like I've been saying for years. And the Devs aren't doing anything to get people to stay


[08-Jun-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and now the PR dev just resigned


[08-Jun-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	woah Promitor queue has been cut in half, last time I checked it was 400+


[08-Jun-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	by making this game an almost must pay-to-play, you drive away hundreds of free players isn't helping it.


[08-Jun-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	wonder how much the server costs are


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	it's 1 server. it's probably less than $100 a month


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	on one hand the graphics are minimum spec, on the other hand there's a lot of relational database work in the backend


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh only $100? wow


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you can run your own server for most games for less than $100 a month


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Or you can take 1500 or so and build your own machine, and run it out of your basement


[08-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	If anyone of you need flux I'm selling 160 flux at 145/u


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We should hear from the devs directly if you want to know the real costs instead of guessing


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	that is, if they're willing to share.


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	are they planning on hiring a new social media manager?


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(if anyone knows)


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Doge looking for a job?


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope, just wanting to get my money's worth


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Is there a dev-sourced stat on how much value is COLIQ'd per day/month? If you assume that most of that value will go into inputs and T1 consumables + parts, we could estimate how much of an impact that actually is.


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	your money is worth what you value it at imo


[08-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Should request it in the next monthly economic report

[08-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@--SCHAITR-- I meant everyone paying for PRO's money's worth


[08-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I expect the game to be at least 33% better in terms of development (if they don't rehire a social media manager) otherwise they'd have to make the PRO license 33% cheaper to compensate


[08-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Slight astericks to your remark Schaitr: You can get not-your-money's-worth if you overvalue a product based upon misconceptions or misleading premises.


[08-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yea and my point is we're willing to pay what we think the game (or anything else) is worth


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep ^^ we may mistakenly over-value something


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	When you guys are talking about COLIQ-ing and how much of an impact that has, why would you liquidate and start anew with just 30k cash if you have like 100k+?


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	or under-value for that matter.


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The idea of the game is great. The execution is pretty neat. The developement speed is atrocious.


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	ya'll been talking about this for past 30 min lol


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@brago some might have made a critical mistake


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@bragosmagos all free players autoliquidate


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Fr Alblaka


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Nah, we also discussed election politics and agriculture.


[08-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	They autoliquidate? Why?


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	.... after a period of inactivity


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	right


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@brago is talking about deliberate COLIQ, no?


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Ah I see


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	autoliquidate means they stopped playing, and hit the day limit, so the game deleted them


[08-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Yes I'm talking about deliberate


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well now you know there's 2 types


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I see


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	COLIQ means you restart. Inactivity liquidate means you exit the game. Different things totally


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	deliberate restarting has no real impact on the game


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Ah yeah that makes sense


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	When you liquidate deliberatively, do you keep your money?


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I see


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	unless you do sneaky things


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	*shrug* I was referring to either type. Any type of COLIQ deletes goods.


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Nope, but you're still in the game (and hopefully contributing)


[08-Jun-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Isn't that what liquidation means though? Turning all your assets liquid?


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it means selling everything your company has at market value (real definition)


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	the only time people colque is because they screwed up, and want to start over. Usually less than a week in game. Sometimes up to two weeks. Usually not longer than that


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the game defines it as restarting over


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I see


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*starting over


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Because it's implied that you declare bankruptcy, the faction seizes all your stuff, liquidates it, but then also jsut gives you another 5 million-in-ships handout.


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Would be fun to have a system where you got atleast some of your cash when you liquidated


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	liquidating in this game means you got deleted. Period.


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Like 10% of all assets


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	ok, I'm off to bed. Have fun, kids.


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	idk why people would want to liquidate like that xd


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Or perhaps a system where instead of liquidating you sold your company to another company as a subsidiary


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	see you later


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I'm just throwing ideas out there lol


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	See you, Talmar


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	people stop playing, and that is why they get liquidated. They aren't restarting, they are leaving


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah with a 2 man team I don't think the devs can do much xd


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there's 2 liquidations


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Yeah I get how tedious, hard and infuriating development can be


[08-Jun-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	1) CO(mpany)LIQ(uidation)


[08-Jun-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	the guy that left didn't do any programming. He was just a social media guy


[08-Jun-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	I've tried making a game couple of times, always ended up quitting


[08-Jun-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	so development shouldn't be impacted at all


[08-Jun-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	And for a game this complex, it must be wayyy harder than whatever I tried


[08-Jun-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think the game would progress faster if they stopped hiring a PR manager and replaced it with a competent dev


[08-Jun-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bragosmagos**:	Yeah I agree


[08-Jun-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	We need more visual cues instead of the sheer amount of data that is pushed onto us players. Maybe they should add more content to make the players' lives better.


[08-Jun-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Me and you can handle it, but spreadsheets upon spreadsheets isn't everyone's thing


[08-Jun-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this is a spreadsheet simulator for a reason ;)


[08-Jun-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	lol


[08-Jun-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Eve online but just the spreadsheets


[08-Jun-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah haha


[08-Jun-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	Me personally though, I love the honest game trailer for this on youtube, its amazing, work of art


[08-Jun-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Alblaka**:	Mind you, the critique towards 'developement is atrocious' isn't solely quantity. It's also the direction. I.e. a fair chunk of dev time was spent on making the MU render in 3D, or on the new leaderboard function. But the recurring contracts button is still nonfunctional. We got a whole mechanic of procedurally generated faction contracts of questionable usefulness. But we still can't put more than the basic 3 templates into a contract, much less just add conditions of our own.


[08-Jun-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	If you have very little devtime to spend, you ought to spend it on features that ACTUALLY improve the game, instead of making things pretty.


[08-Jun-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	hear hear, i'll raise a mug to that Alblaka Exactly on point, where the leaderboard is a colossal waste of time, when there are clearly other areas in far more need of work.

**Alblaka**:	Note that you should also check the companys creation date. There's a couple people that signed up years ago, but only truly picked up the game recently. So they got company age 30, account age 600d.

[09-Jun-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I mean, promising tax cuts specifically to manufacturing, construction and rezextraction is a pretty obvious sign :P


[09-Jun-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Hi guys


[09-Jun-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	If Masterdemon *truly* cared about new players, he would have promised tax cuts for *all* Pioneer tax brackets, not just a select few.


[09-Jun-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	what is this for

**DogeConomy**:	free players can vote


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just not on CoGC


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	nice


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Yep. everyone with a base can vote, albeit only PRO licenses can run.


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(And yeah, COGC only PRO can vote, but it provides it boost to all players.)


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	BTW are we all on the same planet?


[09-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	I see


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Everyone in this channel has a base on Montem, yes


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I knew the pro bit on COGC, wasn't sure on Gov


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But most people have multiple bases, on several planets.


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	or click on Planetary Admin Center within Montem Planet Info


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Alblaka ....which is ultimately the downfall of the Pioneers movement ("Yep. everyone with a base can vote, albeit only PRO licenses can run.")


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Does the governor change


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	copied wrong quote


[09-Jun-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	and when do they change


[09-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	ADM OT-580b has that info for you


[09-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@dezo the governor changes when people decide to vote for a new one in the monthly elections


[09-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Ok i see


[09-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Who is who


[09-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I just gave @Alblaka my vote for Gov.


[09-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	So alblaka and masterdemon


[09-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	It should be mentioned: In most cases the previous governeur is re-elected, and Rubicate has been gov for quite a while and done a great job. But he stated he wont run for governeur again, essentially meaning the position free'd up. And now there's me and masterdemon campaigning for it :D


[09-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Ok i see


[09-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Alblaka wants us to make bank, while @mast3rd3mon wants us to save 1% of cost (tax cuts) in return for less profit overall


[09-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	tell me about yourself


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Really, aside from messing with the taxes, its not going to push a chem to pio swap on COGC, the vote for chem was double that of Pio.


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*due to hypothetical pioneer cogc takeover


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	So tax cuts or a bank


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(making bank = making money)


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Crash5291 unless the governor decides to raise taxes to 999 NCC


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	ok what is the tax right now


[09-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then temporarily people'd vote for pioneers


[09-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Masterdemon's position is anti-Chemistry and promising meaningless tax cuts that won't reduce running expenses by even 1%. I'm promising a focus on ensuring POPI needs are met, and a referendum to provide cheaper T1 consumables to <90d players on the planet, subventioned by the planetary taxes.


[09-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Is that possible on a start planet to jack taxes that high, though they had limits unlike outer worlds


[09-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	LR OT-580b has the tax bracket info


[09-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Can you rephrase @Alblanka


[09-Jun-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm not sure what precise limits exist, but yes, afaik planets *in faction space* have limiters. This isn't related to starter planet status though. Verdant is a starter in independent space, no limits.


[09-Jun-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Cras5291 forgot that limit existed


[09-Jun-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this game is very very technical


[09-Jun-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	The sort of initiatives by both sides


[09-Jun-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	some pages are hidden in obscure corners


[09-Jun-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	ok thanks


[09-Jun-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	generally searching for the topic you want gives relevant results (even the hidden ones)


[09-Jun-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Masterdemon promised to null taxes for Manufacturing, Construction adn Ressource Extraction in the Pioneer tier. But that's less than a 1% cost reduction because i.e. BMPs will cost 40 NCC in taxes (currently) and >4000 NCC in inputs + consumables. So he's promising a tax cut that is utterly irrelevant even to new players 'to help new players'. I'm making no such polittalk, but instead will focus on streamlining the expenses of the planet (mostly upkeep for public infrastructures (='POPI', which provide the workforce), and figuring out a way to provide cheaper consumables to new players. Because THAT's where the costs for new players actually lie. RATs for 130/u is pretty pricy, if you can reasonably print them for 60/u.


[09-Jun-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Yeah, sure I think that your convincing has worked


[09-Jun-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	@dezo: Governeurs can adjust taxes, and have some options for bringing new workers onto a planet... but mostly their job is to use the tax income to pay for upkeep of the various planetary buildings, like POPI and COGC.


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Yep, just read the wiki thanks gys


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	By the way, how did you guys learn to play the game?


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You're welcome :)


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Self Taught xd


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	By playing the game :D


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Lol so true


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Lots of stuff you slowly figure out over time.


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Also I don't have voting rights lol


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	how does this work


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh wait forgot about that


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ah right, you need to be on the planet for 2 weeks.


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	lots of trial and error ont he learning curve


[09-Jun-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Oh damn


[09-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	ok


[09-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	It's a measure to stop people from just dropping / dismantling bases to affect elections.


[09-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	I see


[09-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	and may have chose the wrong profession as well lol


[09-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah most people are usually busy managing their many bases


[09-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	I see


[09-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Note that having multiple accounts *is* against the game's ToS. For experimentation, you can just have your one account, start a company, and then COLIQ later (basically reset to start)


[09-Jun-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and this is intended to be a game where you check in every day for 15 minutes


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	So I sort of know how the game works, is there a way to fast tracking trading


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	in what way?


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Like what to sell


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	and how trading works


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	like the ordering etc....


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(but people like to maximise profits so spend a lot of time overall making spreadsheets)


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ordering is simple buy/sell


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	on a order book


[09-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	e.g CXOB RAT.NC1


[09-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Sure


[09-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	I will check on it


[09-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dezo**:	Have to go


[09-Jun-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SolarAspect**:	Is starting off as a metallurgist then branching out into construction really efficient? I am currently mining my own iron and limestone and producing any other materials I need in a BMP then feeding it into a PP1.


[12-Jun-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	You will be surprised. And the travel time is usually less than Montem to MOR or VAL. Having the CoGC bonus is amazing for your production times


[12-Jun-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	Push your Metallurgy out to Vallis (CoGC bonus plus you extract FE at 14 instead of 8), your Construction to Danakil, and just use the LST on Montem for FLX (that is also CoGC bunus and you need it for your SME anyway) and things will start picking up nicely

**Alblaka**:	Given their account age, 'just make 3 seperate bases' is not exactly sound advice :P For now, they should focus on RoI, which usually means filling out your base witha preferably contained production chain. No need to start with multi-base longterm efficiency-optimization before you can afford a CM.


[13-Jun-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So, @SolarAspect Montems FEO deposit is lackluster, it's LST deposit is average, but you can definitely still do construction, and avoid all the hassle of shipping heavy material. But do keep an eye on whether importing materials and slapping down another PP1 might be more profitable than running 1 PP1 less whilst making your own inputs.

**Talmar**:	If you really want Limestone and Iron, you can make a jump to TO-392 D. Limestone and Iron extraction is 22 each. They also have CLI, with an extraction around the same numbers. Only problem is, it's expensive to live there, but you will never have to worry about Iron or Limestone again.


[13-Jun-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	FEO is 21, LST is 22, and CLI is 17. That is with No Experts.

**Bulletarius**:	is it worth it to use flux and if yes is it better to buy it or make it yourself?


[14-Jun-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it depends


[14-Jun-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you'll have to calculate it. I use flux all the time as my calculations always said it's worth it


[14-Jun-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'll second the "it depends". There's no strict answer, because next to all the factors going in (i.e. efficiency, recipe, market prices) there's also the question of 'how does worth mean to you'; is it raw profit? Reliable profit? Overall production throughput? Resilence against market influence? Area efficiency?


[14-Jun-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I personally use flux, but I do not produce it myself. For me, the reason why I use it is it's simply more efficient. Since I am both in the metallurgy and construction business, Iron is one of my base products for producing construction materials like BBH and BSE.


[14-Jun-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I use a lot of iron so the more iron I can produce in a short amount of time, the better. Also, if there is an excess amount of Iron, I can simply either sell it or make steel and sell it for a higher profit. Hope this helps :)

**BlackAnthrax**:	okay


[16-Jun-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	just did some calculations... moving PG generating POLs to montem with the higher taxes i'd pay 50 ncc tax instead of 2. raising the price of PG by 1.


[16-Jun-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Interesting LR. Seems to line up with the COGC vote the new Gov has. I would venture a guess that they would prefer this planet's COGC to be pioneer. Explains the tax changes..


[16-Jun-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	this was suspected during the election already


[16-Jun-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Interesting. I step back from PrUn for a few months and now Montem is flipping to pioneer?


[16-Jun-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i will continue to vote chem. the taxes aren't really throwing me off as the impact on my production is laughable

[16-Jun-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jun-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Anduin**:	but I would be even more upset if the CoGC went off chem


[16-Jun-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So yeah, this is what I said before the election. Also note that masterdemon promised to null taxes for contruction/manufacturing/extraction pre-election... but now just reduced taxes for all industry except chem, whilst massively raising taxes on chem. The latter isn't technically against their election promise, but it's the obvious dick move I warned would happen.


[16-Jun-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Guess I should have waited with the congratulations for a day, didn't expect them to be that quick and blunt.


[16-Jun-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tardwrangler**:	Hail masterdemon! Hail our people!


[16-Jun-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	So, curious math, repair costs for a CHP are 85 NCC/d. Tax income per CHP is 157 NCC/d. So I'm now strongly tempted to just pause production here, use a spare permit to yeet a new chem base at circe instead. All the POPI demand and COGC voting power, with no taxes paid.


[16-Jun-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	NOOO ALBLAKA U DIDNT WIN


[16-Jun-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm less concerned about me not winning, but about the new gov instantly breaking election promises and additionally screwing over chemistry. I detest dishonesty.


[16-Jun-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jun-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	He slightly reduced taxes for *all* industries (instead of the promised tax nullfication for three select industries) and hiked taxes for chemistry.


[16-Jun-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	oof


[16-Jun-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	I guess it is what it is


[16-Jun-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	It turns out that you cant actually null tax, even though I'm sure I've seen a planed with nulled tax, 10 is the lowest it cant be set to. Its the limitations of the game that mean it cant be nulled rather than by choice


[16-Jun-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	planet*


[16-Jun-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Its the classic move. Tax the current COGC voters until they capitulate.


[16-Jun-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	And a tasty money grab too. I would surely hope that is not the case here, but piracy does come in many forms.


[16-Jun-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I'm not short on cash, any money from taxes will be reinvested either as upkeep, or as popi investments. I've got a base that make me enough money to support all of my bases without the need for the tax income


[16-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Ah, interesting. We again see a response ignoring the root cause of the issue. You are driving Chem off planet.


[16-Jun-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I was part of the coup that pushed Danakil to Construction to let Montem's construction players migrate so we could make this planet Chem. I have no skin in the game today, but I would hate to see all that effort be ripped apart for no good reason.


[16-Jun-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I can afford to invest a permit to keep my 1365 voting power in Chemistry COGC *shrug*.


[16-Jun-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I actually don't get the outrage. If I read the comparison right then Chem got a bit higher taxes on PIO and SET level, for other levels it stays the same. And all other industries got a reduction. And I think it seems fair to tax the highest profitable endeavour in a region highest. I mean it is common sense that Scientists get taxed higher than Pioneers, similarly an industry with 25% bonus can fairly take a higher share in taxes than other industires. Let's also not forget Montem is a starter planet, and there is no chem starter package. This all seems like whining from a bunch of high level players over a few taxes they clearly are able to pay.


[16-Jun-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Thats right about the levels, and that is indeed what I was going for. If all non-new players here apart from a few are chem, the logically they can afford to pay a bit more. It wont be much of a hit on profits, but cumulatively will be a decent amount that can then be reinvested as stated above


[16-Jun-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'll point out that CHPs are cheaper to build then some of the other T1 buildings. There's no chemistry starter package, but Chemistry is far from a 'lategame player industry'. It's not much different from fuel refining, just that it didnt get a starter kit yet. So hiking taxes specifically on Chemistry PIONEERS AND SETTLERS to 'help new players' seem fundamnetally dishonest to me. But hey, I'm just the guy who warned about this outcome a week ago, don't mind me :P


[16-Jun-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	You said it yourself, theres no starter package for chem, meaning that theres unlikely to be any new players instantly starting chem. I lowered taxes for the industries that new players will start as, like I stated I would (wouldve nulled them but the game wont let me)


[16-Jun-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I've already demonstrated the math as to why even your null tax wouldn't help newer players in any relevant capacity. Continuing to use that as a 'but think of the children' excuse to act against the chemistry industry is pretty overt.


[16-Jun-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	You say that, but you wanted to try and lower cx prices on consumables? Or atleast try and beat them on the lm which wont work for free only players


[16-Jun-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Yep. I was promising ACTUAL help for the people I CAN help. Instead of alleging help as an excuse to try shifting a COGC :P


[16-Jun-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(The LM part. Lowering prices on CX is way beyond what a gov can do, that takes corps the size of GTU.)


[16-Jun-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Actually I am not sure low prices on basic stuff is great for new players. As I started out as a Victualler after some time the prices for DW crashed, which was a heavy kick in the nuts for me, as I couldn't stay profitable with fewer experts and multiple planets with possibly different condiftions. I guess it is similar for other early industries, if your main product (and as a starter you only have a few products at best) falls in price you will struggle.


[16-Jun-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Ye, but selectively providing low cost consumables for young players isn't gonna affect the CX price significantly. Like, how much % of the RAT consumption are new players? How much the players each having bases worth of RAT consumption?


[16-Jun-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Also 'well, virtuallers can make a lot of money' isn't really a great point in favor of player retention. It Just means that 80% of new players who randomly pick whatever sounds fun will be shafted over and told "Ye, no, you gotta start as virtualler because RAT prices are always high". That's not fun, I'd imagine.


[16-Jun-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But in the end the best fix for that would be a proper lategame money sink. But we gotta get 3D maps, *one* new contract template and leaderboards first!


[16-Jun-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Now it’s even more important for Chem bases here to vote Chem on CoGC lol. Not likely taxes will come down, so we need the extra 25% to at least reduce the difference we’re making.


[16-Jun-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I mean, nothing's stopping him from hiking the taxes further. I don't trust the new gov after that, so I'll leave the idling base to vote for me, and produce what I need at circe instead. I'm still in the stage where ships are the limiting factor, not permits. :D


[16-Jun-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I mean, there is. Theres a max limit that they can be set at. I set them to that originally but since lowered them again


[16-Jun-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Wait, those 90/180/270 were already max taxes? So you ACTUALLY max-taxed chemistry right away?


[16-Jun-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	And here I was "Okay, he's obviously trying to hit the Chemistry industry, but he's also leaving the taxes at a borderline reasonable level to avoid agitating people too much right away."... thanks to the devs for adding that cap against people like you, I guess :D

[17-Jun-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I just have to roll my eyes. I am doing resource extraction on a planet with chem cogc and never said a peep. Now somehow some see these taxes as "unfair". Eyes rolling. Even going as far as suggesting, they don't mind the taxes for chem staying high (showing that this has little actual impact), as long as the other without 25% bonus also getting these taxes. Eyes rolling again. Yeah, yeah, life is *totally* unfair to chem players.


[17-Jun-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I think the underlying issue that is annoying people is that the taxes are not set to this level because that is what the gov needs to maintain the infrastrucure and improve the planet, they are being used to try to punish one faction over another (or rather to socially engineer the planet) because of the governor's opinion.  But the governor is supposed to do what is best for the planet - and that is clearly not the case at the moment.


[17-Jun-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	If the goal is help the new players because it is a starter planet, then just drop _all_ the pioneer taxes as low as possible. Raise _all_ of the tech/eng/sci taxes high enough to cover the costs of running the planet - don't bounce the COGC back and forth because that makes it hard to plan


[17-Jun-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hm out of curiosity i created a quick survey to get a quick overview of the current montem residents. i'd require at least 200 participants to have a meaningful statistic. so please take your time and fill the 5 questions here: https://forms.gle/54uwo4fqx4bnGEL59

[17-Jun-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'd be glad to be your second and assist in your governorship (win-win as I don't have to throw 8 real life coins per month)


[17-Jun-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	can someone explain me the last question? so you mean like making a corp in which everybody gets their tax distribution and gives upkeep goods?


[17-Jun-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	i.e are you willing to contribute/donate some of your production towards the upkeep (I assume)


[17-Jun-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	sure - (though with 3 pio bases i dont have a large spending power)


[17-Jun-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	night guys gtg


[17-Jun-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	what i mean with the last question is, that you'd be willing to produce upkeep goods for the gov and he pays you for it (from the tax budget). essentially this is funding local players instead of importing goods from somewhere else


[17-Jun-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yeah but thats is for at  least basic players


[17-Jun-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	so if you choose free in the first box you shouldnt be able to check the last box yes


[17-Jun-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's the biggest issue with game mechanics. if you want to make things smarter than dumping and buying at CX you need to have a basic account. that's what the account type question is for.. to get a grasp how the distribution of free/basic/pro players is


[17-Jun-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i can check whether i can ink questions together. but i think google forms isnt that smart ^^


[17-Jun-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jun-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jun-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Alright, so my preliminary analysis suggests that we're good on workforce, even a tad overpopulated, to the point that keeping upkeep on POPI minimized should be fine for a week or more. There was an uptick in Technicians across the past months, and those we actually can't keep happy with POPI just yet. There's a halfbuilt Wildlife Park that was probably meant to address that, and I'll have to do the math on whether that, or just running programms to pull Technicians is more cost-effective. I'll also completely forego Engineers and Scientists, given that there isn't a single FI building that needs them. Anyone got any objections / spotted mistakes in that, so far?

[23-Jun-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, no. Anything that needs doing at the planetary upkeep level will be taken care of by people far older than you. In fact, there's literally a governor collecting taxes on everything you do to pay for upkeep.


[23-Jun-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jun-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	we will see.. i'm running because i want to make it fair for everyone, that's why i'm running the survey, i want to know what i am actually going to govern if i get elected and how i can support the residents as best as possible


[23-Jun-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, my vote will definitely be up for grabs. That's the first time I ever opened up the local rules and did a double take.


[23-Jun-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Now that I've read up a bit, will certainly be interesting to see what happens if there's a chem protest shut down (or if there already is one? Wasn't sure why MOR NS prices kept creeping up), just how much coffee and rat prices are going to rise as HYF's become more expensive to run.


[23-Jun-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Well i had planned a full 500 chem base, parts all ready, but not for those taxes lol


[23-Jun-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh, the taxes aren't enough to break the bank. I did just go ahead and throw down a 500 chem base. However, seeing as the new governor received a 3M NCC endowment to get started, it definitely doesn't appear to be in furtherance of good governance and seems like some kind of oddball punitive measure. I can't imagine it's thought of as a measure to help anyone, since the CoGC isn't going to change, and increasing the price of chem products just makes NS/FLX/PG etc more expensive which goes into all the tier 1 goods like COF/RAT/PWO, and Bfabs, so prices are going to go up for new players...excluding the price hike from a chem shutdown. *shrugs*


[23-Jun-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I think it more as a form of protest to not get a single point of money moved to the gov for the moment after that, all in the name of "helping the new players"


[23-Jun-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerJacques**:	@BlackAnthrax sorry for the late reply. I chose the "Constructor" start. Wondering if I should try to move some Iron or Limestone myself, instead of buying it on the CX..

[23-Jun-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm crunching some numbers for you now @Derjacques so I can give you a more exact idea, but at first glance I think I'd suggest buying the materials for an HB1 and an EXT and digging out LST. Then importing FE and SIO from the CX to produce a 2xBBH/1xBSE mix on your PP1 and MCG on your BMP.


[23-Jun-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	FEO output isn't exactly fantastic here, and then you'd also need to sink for a smelter to get it into a useable condition, while the LST will be useable across both your other production buildings as soon as it comes out of the dirt.


[23-Jun-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerJacques**:	Those are fantastic insights. Thanks a lot! I'll go down that route.


[23-Jun-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ok, crunched the numbers. Assuming you can get RAT @110, DW@95, OVE@115, COF@650, PWO@285, FE@550, and SIO@85, you'll make about 5700-6K in profit per day with 2 construction experts after adding an EXT and HB1. You should be able to get those materials for those prices (or better, I priced a tad high). Later on, once you've grown a bit, you can begin exporting to HRT CX and buying cheaper upkeep materials to bring back with you.


[23-Jun-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	FE price is the one most likely to start rising again and bite you in the backside. If it does, I'd just slide more PP1 production over to BSE's to limit your exposure to FE prices. LST is in fairly plentiful supply right now and should be easy enough to source at decent rates if you have to start importing it.


[23-Jun-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerJacques**:	That is so helpful. Thanks a ton! I really appreciate it. I can already tell that I'll have to set up my own little Excel sheets soon.


[23-Jun-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically, you could probably make "more" building another BMP or PP1 instead of an EXT, but logistics is always something to keep in mind. And LST and FE are heavy, so by having your own LST source you significantly reduce the number of trips you need to make to the CX, and gas is money.


[23-Jun-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerJacques**:	Got it. Sounds like a great plan to me. I'm sourcing the materials for the EXT and HB1 now. Thanks again for your help!


[23-Jun-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Np. I'd offer to sell to a high bid on the CX to help you out....but I'm primarily based around Hortus, and all my materials are warehoused there.


[23-Jun-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Speaking of, a quick note. Make your shopping list early and put in bids for everything immediately. Pretty good chance no one will sell to you, but if they do, you save some money. If they don't, you can just cancel the bids once you get to the CX and then buy from the asks


[23-Jun-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, if anyone needs anything transported to the CX (and have a PRO or BASIC account) let me know. Departing for the CX with a WCB in 15 or 20 minutes.


[23-Jun-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerJacques**:	That all makes sense. Thanks!

**alienasa**:	what's a ghost slot?


[28-Jun-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Planets only physically have room for so many bases. However, if a planet is a starter planet, infinite numbers of new players are allowed to select it for their first base. So once the planet is full, no existing players can put a base there. When a new player selects it and it's full, it creates a ghost plot. No existing player can place a base here until enough players leave to remove all ghost plots and empty out some of the regular ones.


[28-Jun-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alienasa**:	mmmm, interesting. I'm probably one of the4m :D

**ZenWhisper**:	Yes, that's what I figure as well.  If you can afford an AML or three, you can afford a TAI mining outpost.  But at 7.94t/u is is not a fun operation for logisitcs.  I guess I'll get up to 10-12k units, markup most to unreasonable price levels for personal storage and shut it down in a month.

**Blackvelvet00**:	does anybody know how to conduct a planetary exploration survey?


[03-Jul-23 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**moelie1970**:	just fly to the planet, once you land the task is completed


[03-Jul-23 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blackvelvet00**:	alright thank you


[03-Jul-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	you have to tell it to Fullfil to complete it (to be more accurate)


[03-Jul-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the fulfill button on the contract will turn green once you have landed on the planet (to be more precise)


[03-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	once the button is green, you have to click it (to be so precise as to be unnecessary =P )


[03-Jul-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	lol


[03-Jul-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**netopejr**:	Hi there, newbie here. I just bought some stuff on exchange. Do i need pick this stuff somewhere?


[03-Jul-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep at Moria Station


[03-Jul-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you'd need to send a ship there


[03-Jul-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**netopejr**:	i already did that but i dont know how to load my stuff


[03-Jul-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	drag and drop :D


[03-Jul-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(each item) between the two inventories


[03-Jul-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you don't have a warehouse there the item should be stuck in your contracts list


[03-Jul-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	open "CONTS" in a new buffer


[03-Jul-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**netopejr**:	ha, got it


[03-Jul-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**netopejr**:	thank you

[03-Jul-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Wow. Tax hikes and then no CoGC inputs. I hope this isn’t part of your war on Chem folks…


[03-Jul-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	What does this mean


[03-Jul-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	For me as a new player


[03-Jul-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Very little to new players unless you have chemistry buildings.


[03-Jul-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Chem was a route I was actually going to take =(


[03-Jul-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Jesus H Christ. This WILL be a one term governor if I have to PAY people for their votes.


[03-Jul-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	more tax? yay


[03-Jul-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've seen a lot of dick heads in my day, but this one takes the cake. If you didn't intend to behave like a governor, don't run for the position.


[03-Jul-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	the mcg's been paid, so maybe it's just an issue of a smaller company not having the initial funds for the materials?


[03-Jul-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	still taking the piss to raise tax after not paying cogc.


[03-Jul-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	The strike is a limited effect until the upkeep is paid.  The Chem bonus will not be applied until someone puts up the missing goods.


[03-Jul-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	He was bequeathed 3M NCC on his first day as governor by the former governor. Money isn't the issue.


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	reduction in taxes only slightly


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nor did he provide that MCG you see filled. He has contributed NOTHING to the CoGC. That's all other players


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	ah, right. myb, didn't know


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	70 NCC => 50 NCC for chem pioneers, 140 NCC => 125 NCC for chem Settlers


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	still higher than it was before


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you click contribute, you can see everyone who has paid into it.


[03-Jul-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll help


[03-Jul-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	ah, yep


[03-Jul-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there, done the PE.NC1


[03-Jul-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'd take care of the RAT's, but with no ships coming through for the better part of the week, I'd be out of consumables


[03-Jul-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll take care of the RATs, express shipment incoming


[03-Jul-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	i've put up 100 (as token as that is)


[03-Jul-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hopefully the governor is not so tight-arsed about compensation


[03-Jul-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Every bit helps. The CoGC/POPI is 100% the responsibility of the local governor. You shouldn't be taking care of ANY of it.


[03-Jul-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Probably gonna be a zero sum game Doge, otherwise he probably would have bought the stuff himself


[03-Jul-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well In that case I should run for governor next round (I'll decrease taxes back to normal back when @Rubicate was governor)


[03-Jul-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and contribute to shipping economy


[03-Jul-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've idled my facilties. I'm sure 1 500 base shutting down doesn't much matter, but I'd rather take the loss on depreciation then pay anything else into the GOV's coffers.


[03-Jul-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Did the same Zuul


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	good idea, i'll do that too


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	shame though, i just set up the base :/


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	It'll only be for 11 days


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Same, I've not been on the ground but for a week or so


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	10 days looks like


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	10d 19hr


[03-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I’m certain this is an oversight.  Masterdemon has put upkeep on some infrastructure in the last 12hrs, those goods will have more value than the basic consumerables needed


[03-Jul-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you idle, remember to shunt your consumables into a warehouse. That way your workers won't eat them.


[03-Jul-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	well they've said nothing in planet chat despite updating the rules after the strike began


[03-Jul-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically paying "something" by doing that, but it's less than a 500 base running


[03-Jul-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	aight I'm going to extend my pro license


[03-Jul-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Feels more like extremely intentional to me. They've made no secret they want the CoGC to flop to Pioneer instead of staying on Chem. Definitely feels like "take my ball and leave" kind of behavior because the CoGC isn't doing what he wants it to, and why waste money if it's on something they don't want. Not paying the POPI though would screw over all the free players they're trying to "help" though.


[03-Jul-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmmm yeah sounds reasonable


[03-Jul-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(the explanation that is)


[03-Jul-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Especially since it's been roughly 2 weeks since anything was paid into the Chamber by the governor. That's not an oversight.


[03-Jul-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Feeding the CoGC is one of the basic jobs of a governor. Focusing on upgrading POPI levels should have been secondary to CoGC. The amount of inputs required for CoGC is also fixed after each cycle so there’s no excuse for not having the goods on hand. What makes it worse is this IS a CX system with plenty of shipping cap available


[03-Jul-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I don’t usually comment on such stuff but this has really irritated me.


[03-Jul-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	anyone know of any promo codes for PrUn that have been posted recently?


[03-Jul-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No? The last one I can even recall was last Thanksgiving, or there abouts.


[03-Jul-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah TRKY10


[03-Jul-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	guess I'll have to pay full price on the hopes that I get elected xd


[03-Jul-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hopefully I can upgrade my HQs along the way so it's not a waste of money


[03-Jul-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	hell, this has just motivated me to invest elsewhere


[03-Jul-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	My election pitch, plain and simple: I'll return everything back to the way it had been under @Rubicate and will incentivise the local new player economy by posting shipping ads (a lot of them), and are willing to discuss issues with fellow citizens of montem (i.e government programs, partnerships etc)


[03-Jul-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	shut up and take my vote!


[03-Jul-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SolarAspect**:	bruh


[03-Jul-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I feel like rubicate ran it long enough his fees had to be pretty close to right for the population infrastructure that was on place at the time. I can get behind that


[03-Jul-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, I don't even give a shit if the taxes are a little higher than they were before. If it's needed, it's needed. What isn't needed was the initial punitive tax hikes and allowing the CoGC to strike. Long as someone pledges to keep all the wheels turning and the plates spinning WITHOUT punitive measures to try and force a pet project, they have my vote.


[03-Jul-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Damn, wish I knew about this 12 hours ago - I have a stack of RAT on Moria.


[03-Jul-23 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I just put 200xRAT into the till - otherwise have to wait for a ship to come back.  Dogeconomy you have my support - both with votes and it you need PE/DW/RAT

[03-Jul-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well - if you'd had voted for me I'd have at least filled the COGC


[03-Jul-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But this IS funnier


[03-Jul-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So I'm glad this happened


[03-Jul-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, at least you're honest. I'd only be half as big of a sack wouldn't necessarily be the campaign slogan I'd go with, but you've got to admire honesty. Very rare in a politician.


[03-Jul-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	<3


[03-Jul-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I just wanted to be gov cause I was bored. I wasn't about to fire up spreadsheets and do math stuff to optimize anything - that's like...work. No way. Fill bars. Fill bars is fun.


[03-Jul-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	PS - I don't get paid for the bars I fill for Warehouse or for the COGC


[03-Jul-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I just do it because...what else is there to do? Watch money go up? Meh


[03-Jul-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Anyway @mast3rd3mon - fantastic shadenfreunde - I'll 100% vote for you again.


[03-Jul-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	LOL - yes comedy gold here - but also annoying


[03-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Only if you're chem.


[03-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	And I'm not.


[03-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	And I have been at odds with the Chem crew since basically - day 1.


[03-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Soooo


[03-Jul-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	True - only annoying if chem - but I joined the Chem crowd when I moved to TO-392d for Metal and Danakil for Const.


[03-Jul-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah and you probably did that because you and me and everyone kept getting told to "Stop fighting the COGC"


[03-Jul-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	And - I don't like being told to shut up and sit down and follow the rich man


[03-Jul-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Partially, but also partially the 1.25 bonus was nice elsewhere - and getting my ship upgraded in size let me move the metal around


[03-Jul-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Personally, I think the better agricultural worlds should all be agriculture - but that's just me (and I still have 2xFRM on Montem for HER)


[03-Jul-23 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I gave up on montem farming even for self supply - shipping water in is just too much hassle


[03-Jul-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	HER production is so long that 100 H2O lasts forever, but yeah, shipping in H2O was a drag


[03-Jul-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That and Montem is kind of a turd for farming when you have Verdant as an option.


[03-Jul-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cozen**:	^


[03-Jul-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, I will get to Verdant eventually - I even had FRM on Danakil for a while - and if Montem is a turd for ag, Danakil is a shart


[03-Jul-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Montem, Vallis, and Danakil are all shitholes for farming. It's like N on Promitor...yes, it's there, it's technically an option....but who in their right mind would do it.


[03-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Montem is, I suppose, technically better. In the same way that drowning in water is technically better than drowning in piss.


[03-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	LOL - nice visual


[03-Jul-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically Montem is either construction or chem. Frankly I think it's a better construction planet than it is chem...but at this point there's no reason to have 2 construction planets a jump apart. Pretty much anything else is like trying to piss into the wind and then complaining about getting wet.


[03-Jul-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Urine, urout.


[03-Jul-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which, I suppose, is part of the reason I do not at ALL get the strife over what this particular rock should be. FE extraction, smelting, STL manufacture....all better on Vallis. Agriculture/Vic/Carbon Farmer....what are you...high? Fuel Refining....remind me to laugh. So what's the argument, a big bonus to a field which can do well here....or a small bonus to a bunch of industries that would suck gigantic ass putting here anyhow? Whatever, some people just like to see the world burn I guess, lol


[03-Jul-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	My stance has always been that the game shoves construction noobs on to Montem, and I consider it a bit rude to suggest that new players instead just boot strap into chem because thats how the vets like montem


[03-Jul-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	For starter planets - I would like to see a fixed COGC so I agree with you on that basis


[03-Jul-23 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I suppose then you do what everyone does with noobs, explain that this is going to be a rougher start, and if you REALLY want to do a construction start, COLIQ and fly your starter ship over to Danakil. There are plenty of places that tell you they're good for one thing and kind of suck once you get in. Put that on the dev's for not updating the text on the starter screen. Frankly, even with a construction CoGC this isn't particularly great for construction...it's just decent. And with the margins on PP1 level construction....it had better be great, not just decent.


[03-Jul-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Frankly, a friend and I were spitballing what to do to make the game better for noobs and we thought that start planets should be tailored to be great for their COGC, but then after 30 days of playing you get stuff to setup a base on a new planet and at some point you get kicked off the starter world.


[03-Jul-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Course, from what I understand, no one is even advocating for CONSTRUCTION, they're advocating for watered down piss bonuses to the entire Pioneer field, which just gives a shit bonus to 2 decent/good fields, and a bunch of shit bonuses to "why the hell are you here doing that" fields


[03-Jul-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, that's why I am not advocating for the piss bonuses - I don't think we can fix this as players - so I advise new players to play for a bit to learn the ropes then COLIQ


[03-Jul-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So we actually have tried to push both Manufacturing and Construction


[03-Jul-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But we ran into 1 simple issue - it split the vote too hard vs chem


[03-Jul-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	so we united into pioneers with the idea that if we could keep winning it'd drive chem out and then we could sort our own mess out


[03-Jul-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't have much of a dog in that fight as I do both


[03-Jul-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, a pure field isn't exactly going to overtake Chem. It's what the planet is best suited for. Even with a concerted effort you're...what....30% of the chamber vote?


[03-Jul-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I don't think you will ever actuually "drive chem out" - and as Zuul has mentioned Montem is still pretty crap for Construction or Manufacturing


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I dunno dude


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....manufacturing is decent, but so is every planet in the game without hazardous environments.


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's AMAZING for MCG


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh.....


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	You still need to bring in the SIO


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Which is way easier than LST


[03-Jul-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I literally give sio away


[03-Jul-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Plenty of rocks with LST. And frankly, if you turned this planet into a focused MCG producer, the market would be oversatured and bottomed out within a couple weeks and everyone crying about making no money


[03-Jul-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't disagree there but that kinda goes for many things


[03-Jul-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not chem products. Chem products keep the wheels spinning. NS is already stressed and it's what finally started beating RAT prices back down from everyone spinning up HYF operations for bulk production.


[03-Jul-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The NS supply dries up, and the wailing about 140-150 NCC RAT's is gonna come back right quick.


[03-Jul-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Meh


[03-Jul-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	MM RAT rates don't really make me cry


[03-Jul-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It does those precious "new players" people are trying to "help" by driving out chem.


[03-Jul-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	For the record. I have never once said that my goal was to help new players.


[03-Jul-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I think this game is a poorly designed mess for new players and basic

**Mordgier**:	It's basically unplayable without pro imo


[03-Jul-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I think there should be more help for new players on starter planets - but I think the developers need to do that.


[03-Jul-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Devs are clueless and don't really take feedback soooo


[03-Jul-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Here - have missions


[03-Jul-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I also agree that the game is problematic without pro - although the cost per month really isn't bad compared to other games I am familiar with.


[03-Jul-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, literally EVERY argument presented for "Not chem" is some variation of "but think of the noobs". I've not seen any other argument.


[03-Jul-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Cost per moth vs time "played" is....absurd


[03-Jul-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Including yours, since it was literally how it was bad for the "construction noobs" to be told this wasn't the rock for them


[03-Jul-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Mine is personal salt.


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I got here. Wanted to do construction. Got told to do chem.


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	And I got salty.


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	285 days later. Still salty.


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	That's alot of salt!


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I got told to "build STO" - so I refused to build them up until 2 weeks ago


[03-Jul-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, literally 99% of the game is finding the best product to manufacture in a given set of circumstances and parameters and doing that product in the most efficient way possible. Someone just gave you honest advice. I assume they didn't hijack your computer and attempt to force the matter =P


[03-Jul-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Sure and I did that for other bases once I learned the game.


[03-Jul-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's like people starting on Prom and wanting to do metallurgy. Sure, you can do that in a limited capacity....,but you're going to want to swap over to Agriculture at some point. It's just honest advice.


[03-Jul-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Does Metallurgy spawn ppl on Prom?


[03-Jul-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Cause if so - damn this game is an even worse mess than I thought


[03-Jul-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I have 2 new players "right now" doing Metallurgy on Prom. Just now getting 1 to start converting to Ag.


[03-Jul-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	lol


[03-Jul-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're both producing STL with the cheap O on the CX, but I keep telling them they'll stripmine the FE supply off the CX in short order.


[03-Jul-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For now they're making decent money....but it has to be strictly temporary for obvious reasons.


[03-Jul-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But yeah - I'm just super salty. It's folks like @Opalesce-Spectrum who want to help new players. I don't care about them


[03-Jul-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I think the game needs to change fundamentally to improve the basic new player experience to survive


[03-Jul-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I just haven't seen a single cogent argument for how new players are going to be helped by anything going on right now. You're at least honest about "I just want to see the world burn".


[03-Jul-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If I didn't have pro from day 1, I'd not have stuck with it


[03-Jul-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well yeah cause you can't help a day 1 basic


[03-Jul-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	They are walled off from the world


[03-Jul-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure you can. Not to the same "degree" you can help a day 1 PRO.


[03-Jul-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ehhhhh


[03-Jul-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But so long as there is a spread on the products they need, I can get it to them instantly for a lot less....even if I have to kick a few bids out of the way.


[03-Jul-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Loans kickstart players here


[03-Jul-23 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, if you want to give a free player a loan, that's easily done. Pick Hubur or Arclight and buy a product and then bounce it back and forth on the books. Instant transfer.


[03-Jul-23 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can do it in the 4 majors too, but the tighter spreads make it more time consuming.


[03-Jul-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah the market cheese isn't something I'm going to bother to explaining to a dude who doesn't understand buffers in this game


[03-Jul-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If they're not worth teaching the basics too....they're equally not worth giving a loan to.


[03-Jul-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I don't really agree there.


[03-Jul-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if they won't sit around for a lesson on the basics, they have an estimated play time of 45 minutes


[03-Jul-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's super easy for me to give someone a bunch of prefabs 30d payable


[03-Jul-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's WAY harder for me to do basically anything else.


[03-Jul-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Hell, I can't even make people fill out my prefabs order form


[03-Jul-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Like I said, if they're not worth....in this case the time it takes.


[03-Jul-23 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But there's ways around basically every restriction in this game, just like 2 Basic accounts can transfer goods between themselves without a middleman.


[03-Jul-23 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well - see that's the thing. I think the 'value' bar should be very low. I don't really want to judge the 'wroth' of a player - I want to give them a pop and get them going


[03-Jul-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you are judging. You want to be able to skip them past the early game with a minimum of effort. Not worth your time if you have to teach them and walk them through a process. Which is fine.


[03-Jul-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Cause early game is hell


[03-Jul-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Was my favorite part. Counting pennies and "working" to make ends meet. Now it's getting damn close to an idle clicker.


[03-Jul-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For some people, the challenge is the fun part. I don't even LIKE giving loans because it ruins the most interesting part.


[03-Jul-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's fun after 3 weeks


[03-Jul-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	When you still give a shit where your fuel slider is set, etc. etc. etc.


[03-Jul-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	First 3 weeks are horrible


[03-Jul-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I was doing CX to CX trades on my 2nd day. Spent 6 hours doing market research my 1st day. Didn't even expand the base until 3 weeks in and then exploded.


[03-Jul-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ah yeah - the seapea brokerage start


[03-Jul-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	@Onetry did it better I think - although he made some people super mad


[03-Jul-23 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Also - I do think that many if not most people kinda expect this game to be an idle clicker - but they expect more clicks than the first few weeks give them - as it's literally nothing to do for days at times


[03-Jul-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you either like it for what it is or you don't. That's a problem with niche titles. You try and change it to be more "appealing" to certain demographics and it loses what made it special to the people that loved it in the first place in pursuit of an audience that likely never existed. No part of this is going to hold someone seeking an idle clicker long term.


[03-Jul-23 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They'll have died off long before they reach the IDC MM grind, which is about the closest we get to idle clicker. Growing to that point and juggling logistics....99% of your idle clicker crowd will have noped right the fuck off well before that

**BlackAnthrax**:	I read up most of the chat between you two. I get both of your sides. Free players struggle a lot (I started as metallurgy on vallis in November or so..). Since free players are bound to CX they are thrown into the ocean with the sharks who may or may not scalp the commodities you need. For that I can only see 2 solutions. A tier 1 price index which determines the starting credits you get to not go bankrupt for buying 10 C or 5 RAT (Exaggerated example). Or players need to make sure T1 commodities stay affordable for free players (lol as if that's going to happen)

[04-Jul-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Yup.


[04-Jul-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	I complained a while ago already that master demon is not providing cogc upkeep when it's due. One could say it's incompetence or maybe deliberately done to piss off chemists even more.

[04-Jul-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	My election pitch, plain and simple: I'll return everything back to the way it had been under @Rubicate and will incentivise the local new player economy by posting shipping ads (a lot of them), and are willing to discuss issues with fellow citizens of montem (i.e government programs, partnerships etc)


[04-Jul-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll also add a local VC program like I came up earlier on, now that loan contracts are (going to be) a thing

[04-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Free users can't take shipping contracts. I thought a lot about how we can help new montem players on free accounts. Essentially the only way is buying up their stuff on CX. But it takes only 1 random that dumps their products at 1ncc cheaper to ruin the plan or you need to force free players to sell lower on CX than it might be worth.


[04-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	It is really really hard to help free players due to all the limitations.


[04-Jul-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	I'm still refining my gov plan. But I'll have it ready during the election phase


[04-Jul-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have a solution to that- Just make a coordinated channel of communication with a team of PRO/BASIC players that contribute to the planetary upkeep, who will fulfill requests for sale of new players' product at the CX. (Creative Commons License: CC BY)


[04-Jul-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can not “help” free players as a policy. If you want to help new players, you need bespoke solutions to specific individuals. Any “plan” revolves around having so much control of the commodities needed that you can simply dictate the price range on the CX. Anything short of that fails by design. In other words, you can help new players if you’re willing to pour time into them as individuals teaching them, and “maybe” find some places to provide a few hundred credits of benefit, but you can not dictate the market.


[04-Jul-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which is exactly my point, we'd purchase upkeep materials over bid price


[04-Jul-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(generating more profit for the FREE players_


[04-Jul-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and CX-CX trading is also a thing I could teach


[04-Jul-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if they're willing to learn


[04-Jul-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which, in a crashing market, may well be “above” the asks to actually provide growth. If the market is already profitable, they don’t need the help. If it’s not profitable, you’d have to buy up entire swaths of supply and stow it in your backside to get the buy high enough


[04-Jul-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	What I'm getting at, is that my solution is better than players selling stock at bid price.

**DogeConomy**:	i.e LHP.NC1


[04-Jul-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	say a free player makes LHP but is constantly undercut by the big player (e.g @DogeConomy)


[04-Jul-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Meanwhile, any market manipulation of a basic commodity higher may very well be hurting “other” new players that need that material for their operation. The best policy is to help direct players to the markets where they make money. That’s part of the game, studying the markets and choosing the ones that make money.


[04-Jul-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so they're planning to sell to @Lowstrife at bid price of 2500 NCC


[04-Jul-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I need the material for upkeep, @Zuul >:/


[04-Jul-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	...... however my governorship interferes and puts out a buy at 2490


[04-Jul-23 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*2690 NCC


[04-Jul-23 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then they can sell at a higher price than what was originally intended


[04-Jul-23 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and get liquidity fast rather than waiting weeks on a partially filled order


[04-Jul-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, isn’t that effectively the policy so many people catch shit for around here? “Scalping”. Hi, I’ll buy your good for under the ask and then sell it myself. (P.s. This is why people like lowstrife are important, they provide a guaranteed floor for markets).


[04-Jul-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	difference is that our MM service only applies to montem residents with a FREE license


[04-Jul-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hence the dedicated communication channels


[04-Jul-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it’s not outlandish. I do the same thing on prom for new free players by offering to fill fab orders for bid price if they throw their order in on top of the bid stack.


[04-Jul-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don’t know why you need a dedicated com channel though….just ask right here.


[04-Jul-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	because *cough cough* APEX Chat discord server *cough cough*


[04-Jul-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	word would spread around fast


[04-Jul-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh wait found a workaround to this


[04-Jul-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the seller places the order first


[04-Jul-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there :D


[04-Jul-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, you mean everything works as normal. The seller undercuts the current seller, then announces they have undercut the seller “please buy muh stuff”.


[04-Jul-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I applaud the thought process, but this all goes back to bespoke solutions for individuals. They need to get involved in chat, show enough interest to learn, and then communicate.


[04-Jul-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Short of those basic steps, nothing anyone can do


[04-Jul-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah the limitations of the FREE license is just too restrictive


[04-Jul-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*are


[04-Jul-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, but BASIC is not. You can ship, transfer, sell, pretty much do anything on BASIC with some creativity…and ai don’t expect the DEVs to just give the game away. A single 1 month buy basically unlocks the contract system forever. FREE is basically a trial that lasts forever here. A lot of niche titles are like this unfortunately.


[04-Jul-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I agree with your point on BASIC, I've managed to find workarounds myself hehehe during my two-month hiatus from PRO


[04-Jul-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	actually 4 months


[04-Jul-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, the ability to issue shipping contracts on the CX enables most functionality and eliminates the need to have a PRO party anywhere in the transaction process.


[04-Jul-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	good talking with you, I need to hop off now (11:30pm rn)

[05-Jul-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@DogeConomy tbf, I had exactly the same idea. But I scrapped it 15 min later since I realized this can't work out via CX. As much as this might hurt. It's the reality that free players can't receive direct help except for mentoring how the game works.


[05-Jul-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the only way you could transfer wealth to new free players on the CX is to sell them commodities that have been scalped at bid price, and let them gain the cash back that way


[05-Jul-23 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	btw last call for the free shipping


[05-Jul-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Yeah but how often do T1 mats getting scalped? The C shortage in December was not really scalping it was just super high demand and people were willing to pay. Although new players suffered a lot from it.


[05-Jul-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	not mats, anything in general


[05-Jul-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	after the wealth gets transferred, they can buy anything they want


[05-Jul-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Sooo selling to bid brings the problem that in the past scalper just put the highest bid that you have to fuffill up, then sell them expensiv again, which would mean an immens influx of goods that is needed to fufill cheaper bids for lower players


[05-Jul-23 04:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	The only things that actually helps newer players is to give tipps where needed and to keep the pio taxes low, thats about it


[05-Jul-23 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I have 1000+ ALO at MOR, if I see a non-reseller with a buy, I’ll always fulfil.  If I see a new player trying to flip, I’ll usually also fulfil since new players could do with the extra cash


[05-Jul-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Still is an immens investment at non existing starting capital for Bids, don't forget that, and if somebody just dumps a massiv DW or RAT order on the CX because he can, the free players are kinda fed when the Sell price is not low. It all comes down to "If we all play nice, it can work" which is the inherent problem


[05-Jul-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I mean, during the C crisis in December, there were a lot of players recruting newer players for some C making shemes and made off like bandits, just sayin'

**Mnementh**:	@Zuul: "I suppose then you do what everyone does with noobs, explain that this is going to be a rougher start, and if you REALLY want to do a construction start, COLIQ and fly your starter ship over to Danakil"


[05-Jul-23 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Sorry, I started on Danakil, tried Construction, but with starter ships it does not work. LST and FE is too heavy.


[05-Jul-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	You can do that once you upgraded ships and or with higher level economies like with AL.


[05-Jul-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I did start Const on Vallis and worked really well as a start, LST is cheap and light enough to transport and you can start with your own iron on vallis


[05-Jul-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Yes, Vallis at least has the Iron.


[05-Jul-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Much better.


[05-Jul-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Also I want to add: you don't need to fly to Danakil, as Dana is a starter planet itself.


[05-Jul-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It was an example. A new player can start anywhere in the Galaxy they want by moving their ship. There’s no hard wired demand that they place on the planet they select….it’s just where their ship starts.


[05-Jul-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, construction doesn’t mean FE+LST only. You start with BDE production and a splash of BBH and BSE. You moderate your import loads by moderating your consumption…BDE isn’t mass intensive to produce.


[05-Jul-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And for the record, a starting construction player doing a 4/2/1 BDE/BSE/BBH production load, with their BMP creating PE, who adds an extra PP1, needs to make roughly 1 trip per week to the CX. Once you expand that out to a full base, you reach the point of needing a trip a day. Of course, Danakil to MOR is less than 8 hours with min+1 tick fuel useage...so...about 34% of your logistics capacity. Not even remotely impossible or even bad.


[05-Jul-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Noq** left.*


[05-Jul-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Sorry, you just hack around to make look Danakil somewhat OK for construction? Flood the market with BDE... You basically said that Dana *IS* a bad planet for construction.


[05-Jul-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And all what you write is about: "play as I say or you play the game wrong". I just did stuff and kept at it if it works and changed if not. And had fun with it. But I guess every game has the toxic parts of the community, that thinks playing differently is the *wrong* way. Above was the comparison of drowning in water instead of piss to paint a picture that all these options are *wrong*. Guess what, it works for some players and why not. But I guess we are all not as good as the Gigachads and should shut up.


[05-Jul-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I am usually not averse to a playerbase, but reading the gaslighting that we should believe Dana is a better construction planet than Montem does it for me. If the chem cartel is that toxic, I applaud every try to sabotage them.


[05-Jul-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It has nothing to do with right and wrong ways to play. You can play less efficiently IF YOU CHOSE. That being said, the numbers are the numbers. If you WANT to play less efficiently because you want to hammer a square peg through a round hole....fucking have at it. It was less than ideally efficient for me to build 4 new planets from scratch in a developed universe, but I still went ahead and did it because I enjoyed it.


[05-Jul-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But don't bitch and moan because the less efficient method is less efficient, and someone tells you if you want to get off and running faster you should chose a more efficient and profitable method.


[05-Jul-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Sorry, I didn't bitch and moan and my less efficient way led me to expansion and to Montem on the way. But the chem cartel did bitch and moan about some taxes, even though they are doing barely anything.


[05-Jul-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	So it is quite rich that you gaslight me by telling I bitch and moan, I only complain about the ridiculous bullshit the chem crowd is posting here.


[05-Jul-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The "chem cartel" bitched about a day 1 governor with a vast bequeathment of free money maxing taxes day 1, who then backed off after a huge bitch fest. Who fails to take care of the POPI and the COGC, and is in all ways an abject failure.


[05-Jul-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And yes, the taxes did get shifted to maximal values before being dialed back.


[05-Jul-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	So what?


[05-Jul-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And the chem crowd did bitch and moan for days on end before upkeep was neglected.


[05-Jul-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My, what an intellectually sound argument you've presented.


[05-Jul-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	?? what are you talking about?


[05-Jul-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Says the person who claims POPI was neglected? I've been trying my very best to improve the infrastructure and upkeep for popi. Culture and education are up as they arent say on 2.9% anymore. I'm trying to improve it more but popi infra is so expensive, even pumping in way more of my own money than what comes from taxes (as it really isnt much) doesnt help to improve it that fast


[05-Jul-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	sat on*


[05-Jul-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why did you spend vast sums pumping Culture and Education? Those are for scientists. The vast majority of your workforce, and literally everyone you're building for doesn't need those. Those are scientist needs.


[05-Jul-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Theres open ENG and SCI jobs, so yes they are needed


[05-Jul-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	We're short on 258 ENG and 79 SCI


[05-Jul-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@mast3rd3mon: uhoh, apparently you are playing the game wrong, let master @Zuul explain :-P


[05-Jul-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	103, actually


[05-Jul-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which would be completely eliminated next week by continuing to run PF3 with no extra infrastructure.


[05-Jul-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	103 what? POPR OT-580b states 258 open jobs for engineers and 79 open jobs for scientists


[05-Jul-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Those numbers are before the change value is calculated.


[05-Jul-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So you are at 258-155= 103 with a positive trend of 150+ a week


[05-Jul-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Maybe for engineers then, but thats still 7 weeks for scientists if that is the case


[05-Jul-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of which is, more or less, the problem of whoever chose to build scientist production structures here. It is your responsibility as governor to manage the planet, not to spend the entire operating budget on 1 building and let the basic functions of governance go unfilled.


[05-Jul-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	General upkeep of current population is job 1 - expanding it for others should be lower priority


[05-Jul-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I've had to spend like 12m of my personal money (after my ship arrives in 2h) to actually keep popi upkeep and stuff going, compared to the 3m I've received from taxes


[05-Jul-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I've been keeping popi upkeep going, some stuff is either overpriced or not on the cx which is why there are gaps in some of the popi upkeep stuff, but I try to keep the rest of it filled where I can


[05-Jul-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You may have wanted to reach out for help then. Because there are things filled that ought not be filled, and cheap things that are empty that ought to be filled. If you've spent 12M in a few weeks....you've done something very, VERY wrong somewhere.


[05-Jul-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I've been filling popi upkeep and buying some stuff to upgrade parts of it. And as its just been pointed out, its the governours job to keep it going, not to ask for help


[05-Jul-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I agree with Zuul - run up a HELP flag if you are over your head.  Stop upgrading until you have ability to keep all upkeep paid.


[05-Jul-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Part of running the government is issuing contracts for supply. Also, nothing needed upgraded. That should have been relatively obvious by the fact that the planet has run for AGES without the wheels falling off with only the infrastructure that existed before you took over.


[05-Jul-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I've got the popi upkeep paid, apart from the stuff that I already mentioned was either too expensive or isnt available on the cx


[05-Jul-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Pretty sure governors reach out to individuals to provide the materials needed on stanard contracts - I was looking at providing OFF at one point


[05-Jul-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Look at your medical facility....TUB's are unfilled. Glass is abundant and dirt cheap. All you had to do was ASK and you'd have had a flood of TUB's produced.


[05-Jul-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	I've got a ship for that coming in 2h, I misjudged the time/reserve that it had


[05-Jul-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not like every major planetary governor doesn't ask for materials sourcing. I don't supply Prom with part of it's upkeep every week or anything. Not to mention other worlds.


[05-Jul-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And most everyone I know of does it for less than the market rates...even when the market rates are good. Cultivating sources is part of the job.


[05-Jul-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I'm actually providing HAB for another gov right now, because i got asked if i could do that for cheaper than cx. After getting the SOI for free, i ofc made it dirt cheap. Basic trading lol


[05-Jul-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	For an example, I make 20k of PE a week - if you want me to fill the COGC-PE upkeep every 10 days, perfectly willing to do that - setup a fixed price contract and I can bill you whenever I fill it.


[05-Jul-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	If players *know* that it is a constant contract, they will accept a lower price because it is fixed.


[05-Jul-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Exactly what craftsman is sayin'. A Gov contract is always more lucrative then to hope to sell to the cx, even if you make less money lol because you have a constant taker for your produkt and saftey>shortterm gain


[05-Jul-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Funny how nobody has offered before now, and it takes someone to say "im doing a bad job" for there to be ffere


[05-Jul-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	offers*


[05-Jul-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	How about asking openly because it's the gov. job since nobody can look into private production?


[05-Jul-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No one offered because the man in the big chair didn't ask. he just walked in day one and dropped a bomb on the majority of the planets active population and wondered why no one brought out the wreaths?


[05-Jul-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Why would i ask for help when I have enough income to fill it from the cx? Everyone can see what the upkeep needs are, they arent private


[05-Jul-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I will offer to take care of COGC-PE needs for 10k NCC - which is a price per 5.98 per PE which is cheaper than the market.


[05-Jul-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	You should ask because setting up those long-term contracts is part of the job of governor.  You are more of a manager then having to do it all yourself.


[05-Jul-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	What the heck did you expect? You started out extremely unpopular, but people gave you the benefit of the doubt that you would at least govern maliciously competent. OF COURSE every mistake you make is gonna be highlighteded.


[05-Jul-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because no one but YOU has the responsibility to deal with it. That's the governors job.


[05-Jul-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Exactly, and I've been buying the needed upkeep as mentioned like 3 times above. The infirmary lack of upkeep was because of misjudging it and having my ships elsewhere


[05-Jul-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	But if you outsouce to people - you simplify your task - well you still need to do the work of organizing people to help - but once those agreements are setup you just have to keep an eye on it and DM when people are slow to fulfill there part.


[05-Jul-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	.......You literally just said you don't have the income from the planet, that you had to spend, and I quote, 12 million above and beyond the 3 million you got in....what....3 weeks since you took over? That's disastrously bad and has nothing to do with misjudging a TUB delivery timing.


[05-Jul-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Somewhere, someway, you are absolutely blowing it.


[05-Jul-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I think people are more referring to pointless upgrades, lack of COGC upkeep, etc. I.e. what is the reasoning behind the Infirmary upgrade? Pios are overhappy, Settlers are sound, and anything else isn'T really targeted with Infirmary, methinks.


[05-Jul-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Frankly your first act upon winning (after you played with the taxes) should have been a post "Anyone interested in supplying the GOV with inputs, DM me and we will talk about it"


[05-Jul-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	OR, I Would have pinged Rubicate ahead of the election to ask what his running supply contracts were, to start from there.


[05-Jul-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, even if I took the planet I run, and multiply my upkeep costs by 40x to get well above the population here (and I maintain much higher needs fulfillment averages) I don't even come CLOSE to a million a week after multiplying by 40. What the hell happened to get to 3M+ a week.


[05-Jul-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Too late Alblaka :(


[05-Jul-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(aka, ahead of election closure, if it was reasonable to assume I could have won. I was in contact with rubicate, but that went irrelevant when I didn'T get voted in)


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Now we can only prepare some popcorn to watch the unfolding drama


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have to fun - but my offer to take over the COGC-PE is on the table - DM me if you want me to do that.  I can probably supply other things as well.


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have to *run* - sig


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	*sigh* - double sigh


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	lol, you're in a hurry, typing mistakes are made =)


[05-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I am in a run to get more coffee - LOL


[05-Jul-23 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	1d6h before I can vote for someone who understands what sustainable inputs and tax levels are.


[05-Jul-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Anyway, details of agreement would be I supply the PE and then send you a contract for a PE that costs 10k - and this offer would continue as long as I play. - DM me to talk about it.


[05-Jul-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	At the very least this election is gonna be interesting.


[05-Jul-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If I'm voted in, I'll establish local business contacts with anyone interested in doing so (like I mentioned previously multiple times), and make sure I invest my resources in the most efficient way possible.


[05-Jul-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	whoop 2 new plots just opened up


[05-Jul-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup, quite a few numbers should have been dropping off between....lemme see...


[05-Jul-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	3 days ago to maybe another day or 2 from now.


[05-Jul-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm interested in seeing how you've managed to keep track of this data for so long :)


[05-Jul-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The big surge ran from roughly 12 days ago to....oh...tapped off pretty strongly about a week ago. Accounts less than a week old get axed 8 days after initially going inactive. So we should have seen people start dropping 3-4 days ago


[05-Jul-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And continuing through maybe tomorrow. Then maybe a small amount of people who played for a few days before stopping.


[05-Jul-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	After that we wont see another tranche of big losses for 3 weeks from now or so, from people who played a week and then quit.


[05-Jul-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lots of people did stick around though, average concurrency is up about....oh...25% or so


[05-Jul-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Oh I thought it was more like 5-10%


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	We had sunk down to about 230-250 concurrent connections before the big spike joins


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	So that means that the latest ad campaign was pretty good at attracting the right playerbase


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Wasn't even an ad campaign.


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Not bad - user count going up is always good.


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Random post on a news group amalgamation site about eve online, where a comment about this game wound up on top of the stack of comments


[05-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	free advertising xd


[05-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, it was kinda random - but we take what we can get - generally word of mouth is always better than an ad campaign.


[05-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Just ask Lucasfilm about Indiana Jones ticket sales - or rather the lack of tem


[05-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And, to answer your earlier question, I was able to keep track of the data because the start of the surge predates my base by about 12 hours. So I can just look at my building age =)


[05-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	wonder how much the devs made this past fortnight on PRO license sales


[05-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh okay


[05-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(they got 21 euros out of me xd)


[05-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A decent number, probably not huge. I know I got 4 new players to pick up PRO so they could take my shipments


[05-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I paid up for another 6 months - if I am still playing in December I will go for the higher tier and name TO-392d


[05-Jul-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If I get elected as governor I might consider a renewal after 3 months


[05-Jul-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Instead of "B-fab World" I will go with "Sabaton" - I moved my PP* complex to Danakil


[05-Jul-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmm interesting


[05-Jul-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I may eventually move my PP3's and 4's to Danakil. Running 2 permits on Adalina, so taking them off and going to 1 would get me more productive space.


[05-Jul-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	All metal production all the time!


[05-Jul-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	As long as you have the shipping - I had to wait for a 3k/1k freightor before I could do it.


[05-Jul-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, if you want to do PP1 construction, you're pretty much limited to prioritizing plastics or doing it in situ.


[05-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	My next project is 3xCrappy STL craft - only 250/250 and glass engines, but built entirely by me.  Then I tackle a crappy FTL ship


[05-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then possibly upgrade them...?


[05-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	ooh, exciting :3


[05-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've been trying to make an extra market for PP1 plastics production by cratering the PE price in HRT to make a valid BDE export/PE import loop.


[05-Jul-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Think last I checked it was the cheapest PE in the game, but that was a few hours ago, lol


[05-Jul-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if HWP income falls I'll replace them with shipbuilding infrastructure


[05-Jul-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yes, upgrading ships seems to be more like legos in this game, so no reason no to build the cheapest crap the work up to nicer stuff.


[05-Jul-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	*no reason NOT to build the cheapest crap, THEN work*


[05-Jul-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....there kind of is, since you by default lose anything you take off and replace with something better. So you're setting money on fire when you upgrade a new build later.


[05-Jul-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not so much with the starters, since those were free in the first place =)


[05-Jul-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^ 100% true


[05-Jul-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, I was told you can't add an FTL to an STL ship later on, although I have never tested that, so it's untested word of mouth


[05-Jul-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	True, but I mean more a penalty for upgrading - other than just losing the crap stuff - I won't cry about losing a glass engine when I can build a useful engine.


[05-Jul-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think @Zuul was saying the glass engine doesn't become available for you to resell


[05-Jul-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I might try the STL -> FTL thing when I get there, but I don't care is they stay system boats, but at some point I want them to go from 250/250 to 3k/1k


[05-Jul-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but then there'd be a massive influx of cheap ship parts


[05-Jul-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yes, I understand, they drop the old parts in the sun to keep the shipyard nice and clean. :-)


[05-Jul-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmmm


[05-Jul-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I meant no penalty on top of losing the old parts


[05-Jul-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My need for efficiency just got all twitchy when you said 3K/1K system boat since at that point, you've basically paid for a new FTL ship with the cost of the bigger crew quarters/etc. Because you'll have to scrap everything when you upgrade the cargo bay that large.

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I thought that would :-)  but by the time that happens I think we will be a year or two down the lin.


[05-Jul-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean...once you have stacks of cash to burn, the need for efficiency decreases....I totally don't pretend I'm speed racer everywhere I go now, lol


[05-Jul-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Gotta subsidize the fuel industry somehow =P


[05-Jul-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Basically at 8 bases I realized that shipping was my biggest problem, and contracts only go so far - so first 3xcrap STL, then 2xcrap FTL craft


[05-Jul-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	And as I build my company out then I can start making nicer pieces - but I will likely just add better ships and not refit the old until I have cash to burn.  Because of the issue with the parts - if you refit the entire ship,migh as well have a new ship plus the old one.


[05-Jul-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Anyhow, for newer players trying to get into construction....that was a serious thing I mentioned up above. I'm deliberately keeping PE prices squashed in HRT to allow for a valid BDE/PE export/import loop. You can pick up cheaper consumables there too since I've squashed OVE prices as well, and RAT/DW is generally cheaper there.


[05-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it would be interesting for a new player to have 1 base around the moria region and another at the hortus region


[05-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I haven't checked the other markets recently, I will have a look.  Do alot of newer players do profit off shipping contracts?


[05-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	CX-CX trading would be a must (and would be very beneficial to them)


[05-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A lot of shippers are absolutely fucking miserly on shipping. I generally don't offer on public listings and offer far more lucrative and constant jobs to newer players direct. So...depends who they're working for. CX to CX has always been decent money.


[05-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I just built a new STL shuttle (GEN, LHP) for traffic between MOR-Val-Mon. I got a cheap GEN engine, so it made financial sense to do it and allow my other 2 ships to move FTL traffic to/from MOR.


[05-Jul-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@CraftsmanThirteen As a player that posts 10 NCC/t shipping ads, yes new players make a lot from shipping

**DogeConomy**:	what was that username xd


[05-Jul-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To be fair, distance is a huge part of that equation. Is that intrasystem shipping at 10 NCC/t or outsystem?


[05-Jul-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	twice the fuel costs at minimum burn (most of my contracts have long expiry too)


[05-Jul-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	even if it is out of system it is twice the cost of fuel/repairs


[05-Jul-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I can't be bothered calculating separate rates for separate routes as it would get very complicated very fast


[05-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Still depends. 10 NCC/t wouldn't even get me out of my bed depending on the route.


[05-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, I need to get better at pricing my contracts - I think I sway better way too much and waytoo little.


[05-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And that was on day 1. If that was intrasystem though, that's great money.


[05-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	any money is better than no money


[05-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I know I pay 16K for a starter ship to do a round trip from HRT to BOU and back. Only 4K for intrasystem flights.


[05-Jul-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plus, the majority of my shipping ads are from Moria to Verdant which often have empty ships going in that direction


[05-Jul-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	since verdant is an exporting planet


[05-Jul-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so people take the ads nonetheless


[05-Jul-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Same with Boucher. Pretty much 100% exports. All the blasted water, lol.


[05-Jul-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Gotta run - back to work for me - I have started doing Verdant to Moria contracts as I need the RCO.  Altough I will settle there when I get a third FTL ship - aaaahhhh - dreams.....


[05-Jul-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I technically pay people to make round trips, and I almost never send cargo down.


[05-Jul-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I haven't landed a ship there in 2-3 months


[05-Jul-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I still hit Boucher myself once in a blue moon. Have 2 sad lonely INC's down there burning C. So I go personally when 1K C is ready for pickup.


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I might experiment by shipping stuff for a base to Verdant and see if I can run the planet without ever sending a ship there.


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	tried and tested


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	even sent 100s of aluminium back and forth


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Well, that is me next plan then after I finish resorting my bases.


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	none of them got priated


[05-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hell, you can run a "base" on some of those planets with nothing but a warehouse and some LM ads.


[05-Jul-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Plenty of BASIC players without the shipping overhead eager to unload for anything resembling a decent price. Then you just ship it out.


[05-Jul-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and would you look at that, 3x VER => MOR ads just got delivered


[05-Jul-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, I have started doing the warehouse/LM thing myself


[05-Jul-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	in good time too, 2/5 days


[05-Jul-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I got my first shipment VER/MOR in yesterday and have another one in transit.


[05-Jul-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Now I really have to run - LOL - catch ya all later


[05-Jul-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	In summary, I'm very satisfied with the shipping services provided to me via the LMs


[05-Jul-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	cya


[05-Jul-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	How bad is farming on Montem?


[05-Jul-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Its not great, I did a little of it when I started, but there are much better places elsewhere.


[05-Jul-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The H2O isn't high enough to be really sustainable, while the fertility is not high enoughto compete elsewhere.


[05-Jul-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	On the plus side, there are alot of people here and the CX is also right here - so you can make money by taking shipping contracts - just watch your cost on fuel.  The COGC is Chemistry, which means you get a 25% bonus on any Chemistry building.


[05-Jul-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	That being said, for the early game and learning how to operate, it is a pretty decent planet for that.  DM me if you want to chat some.


[05-Jul-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	(click on my user name, then select "contract user" and ask away)


[05-Jul-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Awesome, thanks


[05-Jul-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just popping in. Farming, on a scale of "Wretched" to "Great" comes in at around a "Bad". There are definitely worse, but there are MANY better.


[05-Jul-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Fertility is a modifier to production speed. The baseline is 0%, many planets have a positive modifier to production speed. This one is negative.


[05-Jul-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And while you might just think "Producing a little slower isn't a big deal", keep in mind that not only does it directly reduce your profits (by reducing the number of profitable goods you knock out per day), it also directly increases the cost to produce a unit of goods, as it increases the cost of worker consumables and building repairs per unit produced. So you make less of it, and each unit makes you less money.


[05-Jul-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	That's a good point


[05-Jul-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Perhaps I'll just look more into taking advantage of the chem bonus here


[05-Jul-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, that's a huge part about stacking efficiency bonuses as high as you can get them. Not simply because you produce "more" of something, but because the actual cost to produce decreases.


[05-Jul-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Efficiency of scale is very much a thing.


[05-Jul-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Thanks for the tips!


[05-Jul-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Keep in mind the entry chem building is a CHP. While you "can" run it with just Pioneers, it'll be "very" slow, although at least in that case the consumables cost decreases in direct relation to the slowdown since you're just outright not employing the settlers.


[05-Jul-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	POL's are actually probably more efficiency with just PIO's (28% vs 25%) but the buy in cost is significantly higher.


[05-Jul-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Really....don't do either without some settlers.


[05-Jul-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Hm yeah I'd have to do that on my next expansion since I'd need more settler capacity


[05-Jul-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That being said, I think an HB2 is actually cheaper to lay down than an HB1. So there's that, lol


[05-Jul-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	about to build a PP2 which will max them out


[05-Jul-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Dropping a PP2....you going in on Lfabs or going to knock out some AEFs?


[05-Jul-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you haven't looked at those, Lowstrife is usually pretty good about holding a market floor. Inputs to produce AEF are only about 2K, and he's buying at 3600. So you could ignore AL entirely and knock out some AEF's. You get 2 a day with no efficiency boosts. With a couple of experts you'd probably get around 4K or so a day minus your worker consumables. Not sure how that compares to Lfab production right now.


[05-Jul-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Again my reminder for my survey https://forms.gle/WP2EXu5NtHGEcHMUA unfortunately I got only 25% of the volume that I consider big enough to pull a conclusion. However I will still release the insights I gained by the end of the election phase, even though it's not really representative like that.

**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Lfab, because I have a WPL as well


[05-Jul-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hell, if you're just spraying every industry there is, it actually does make sense for you to go ahead and lay down a POL. Can go right from C/H/MG to PG into NL into LDE


[05-Jul-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	That's my plan, currently buying PG but yeah that's the goal for now


[05-Jul-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Eventually into PP3 and building whatever the LDE feeds into, but for now I'll just sell them


[05-Jul-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	HAL into CHP -> CL. CL into LAB -> TCL. TCL into WPL -> KV. KV + LDE = RDE in a PP3. Honestly though, at that point, without efficiency bonuses from bespoke planets....you're going to have a hell of a time turning profits. So I assume you'll have moved into new digs by then.


[05-Jul-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, and EPO....but that's still CL into a POL, which you'd have for the PG.


[05-Jul-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Yep that's essentially what I've spent the last few days mapping. But I was going to skip KV until the very last and use the CL for EPO and use the WPL for NL


[05-Jul-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Being an extremely new player you're really helping me validate that at least on paper the plan makes sense =)


[05-Jul-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Seeing as you just came up with it nearly verbatim haha


[05-Jul-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	And it took my like 5 days


[05-Jul-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	me*


[05-Jul-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, I have a basically identical set up, it's just spread across 5 planets. Have 5 planets in a tight little 3 system span. One mines HAL/LST/FEO. HAL goes to a chem world where CL/PG/EPO/TCL are made. PG/TCL go to a manufacturing world where NL/KV is made. The aforementioned FEO gets shipped down to a smelting world (where I also mine ALO), then the FE/AL/STL from the smelting world go to construction rock along with the NL/KV from the manufacturing world and the EPO from the chem. The whole lot is within 1 jump either way of the construction world. Then I have an O tap 2 away for feeding the smelters and making STL. That's 3 of the planets I built from scratch.


[05-Jul-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have a somewhat similar but different setup - Danakil is where my PP* plants are, with TO-392 providing FE/STL, Montem provides the PG/TCL and Circa (QQ-001a) providing the NL/KV/PE -- I don't have an AL source so have to buy that.


[05-Jul-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup, and I myself may eventually move my higher numbered PP's onto Danakil. Thankfully all my pre-existing industry is right on the HRT/MOR border, so it's not much of a logistics shift to accomplish.

[05-Jul-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Yeah circa is on my expansion map for WPLs and BMPs in the future. I will need about 4k PE/d to keep my AU planet running that I planned a while ago

**BlackAnthrax**:	Since the election is about to begin, here's my plans IF i become gov of montem: equalize taxes among all industries so no one gets a special treatment; leave cogc up to the people to decide, this is not a govs responsibility, apart from providing upkeep; make sure current upkeep has PRIORITY; plan the needed budgets for POPI upkeep so taxes stay as low as needed and as high as necessary; Buy upkeep from montem base owners with priority, so they get something back from the paid taxes; weekly updates of the state of things in order to be transparent to the residents of the planet


[06-Jul-23 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i just want to say : this would be my first time as a gov ever. but i'm quite reliable and always have been a team player, so I feel I can grow into the role of gov and make montem a prosperous planet with your help :)

[06-Jul-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I guess my only question for you is, do you actually have the personal funding, or a guaranteed backer to provide funding for the planets upkeep. While the astronomical sums run up building new POPI in the last term is anything but the normal expenditure….it is still a significant expense, and you won’t see much in the way of tax income until 7-14 days after you take the big seat.


[06-Jul-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Specifically because corporate collected tax is only remitted at the end of periods, and any jobs started before the change of government will still pay to the previous government.


[06-Jul-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, have you studied the mechanics for how POPI generates, and population consumes, the various need categories?


[06-Jul-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i read up a lot beforehand and im working on a plan to most efficiently provide upkeep. and unlike other people i am not scared to ask for help when things aren't clear to me.

[06-Jul-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And the financial part? Can you cover the initial upkeep purchases out of pocket before tax revenue starts coming in? Do you have/need a backer if not?

**--SCHAITR--**:	Anyway I'll just state for the record that I'm not against a tax increase, provided there is good data showing the amount increased is needed.

**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd rather have someone stably running the place than have someone lowering taxes and spamming POPI just to bankrupt themselves in a week.

[07-Jul-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	@Vasyklo hm better to use LST to build your own prefabs (assuming you started as constructor) but you can't also directly trade unless you buy a license. you need to use a commodity exchange. i suggest worry about getting a foothold first before you supply govs


[10-Jul-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Is there an actual government use for LST, or is that personal? I'm drawing a blank.


[10-Jul-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	@BlackAnthrax yep construction. And will do, I did get pro cause a couple of my friends started as well so we are figuring all this out quickly


[10-Jul-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Playing with friends makes the game much more enjoyable, since you can try to figure out how to work good together at the start :3


[10-Jul-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@zuul not really, unless the govs needs stuff to produce upkeep mats by themselves


[10-Jul-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@vasyklo then i can only recommend only selling the surplus LST. as will need it for yourself

**Zuul**:	Going to be real honest. Don't be afraid to drop the tax bomb on the top tiers. Most likely culprits would be AML's and EEP's, and anyone running THOSE can afford to pay the taxes it takes to pay the ridiculous amounts it takes to upkeep that worker tier.

**BlackAnthrax**:	dumb question regarding SOI what is the actual source of BRM in the current universe? A while ago when montem was completely full i had my eyes on XH-083a as second chem base because of the existing BRM and chem cogc.. then when i was ready to expand i saw that all the people with bases there were basically not playing anymore and i dont want to run POPI for myself.


[12-Jul-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i think it's still an okayish planet. with only being cold and it's a nearby source of BRM and quite dense

[12-Jul-23 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah but all of them aren't very much populated. and probably for a reason. BRM is needed for SOI and REA which are also needed for higher tier consumables.. so i wonder where is all the commecially sold BRM coming from? :think:


[12-Jul-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hmm i see the guy who sells on CX uses WB-947b which unforunately has 2 negative conditions

[14-Jul-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I can't be sure about the tax revenue until 2 weeks later (since my term starts on the day before the financials update/tax gets paid)


[14-Jul-23 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I believe the taxes in montem will break even. The default taxes at montem are twice as high compared to promitor (which does makes sense since there's lot more higher tier workforce, specially engineers), and promitors budgect breaks just about even, with just a bit of helping hand from me when it comes to POPI upgrades


[14-Jul-23 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i mean you can't perfectly estimate the tax revenues.. because it's only based on pop type and not number of pops


[14-Jul-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and depending on whether people run production ordersd


[14-Jul-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	true


[14-Jul-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	then again. most of the work will be setting contracts with suppliers and actually calculation what is needed without overshooting need coverage to be most efficient.


[14-Jul-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	according to the calculations i did for example we need to fully supply the safety station to get to 50% safety coverage.


[14-Jul-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	correct


[14-Jul-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	in the end you can also safe some taxes by not fully supplying a need and it will be multiplied by x/7 if i understood correctly.


[14-Jul-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	7 being the days in a week, and x being the number of days in that week that a certain upkeep good is supplied


[14-Jul-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yes


[14-Jul-23 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's what i meant with "it could be more efficient to put only a fraction of upkeep in a higher tier building instead of a lower tier building" but it really depends on the NCC/coverage where you want to be as close as possible to 1 ^^


[14-Jul-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I handed off a budget of 3m NCC so there shouldn't be an issue in keeping upkeeps fulfilled while the perfect tax rate is calibrated


[14-Jul-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Well, apparently that budget went into random POPI upgrades nobody needed :P


[14-Jul-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Sounds unwise


[14-Jul-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But no fault on you there, Rubicate. During the election, I repeatedly pointed out that masterdemon was talking nonsense. People voted him anyways, he messed everything up, reap what you sow. Here's hoping Doge will do a better job, even if that isn't necessarily a high bar to clear rn :D


[14-Jul-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They should do ok. By reaching out early they were able to find suppliers of various goods before taking office.


[14-Jul-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	dang it missed my chance to ask @rubicate some questions


[14-Jul-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	didn't know they'd log on today


[14-Jul-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(was going to ask about the scientist population tier)

***nadroj151** joined.*


[14-Jul-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	the uni/lib will help a lot keeping high tier pop. with the current total pop it's not easy to budge happiness much higher on eng/sci.


[14-Jul-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah that's why I was confused


[14-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	im working on getting the lu made to finish it


[14-Jul-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	with the tax reductions on non-chem a lot came out of pocket too so not like anything was wasted


[14-Jul-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so should SCI upkeep be left to the people who run scientist buildings on Montem or should I adjust scientist taxes if they're not sufficient enough?


[14-Jul-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	aim for the 50% with fest3 still that's about the best you can do.


[14-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	how'd the Scientist upkeep go anyway back when @Rubicate was governor?


[14-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(e.g who did what)


[14-Jul-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@MemoryAlpha will try


[14-Jul-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	a culture building would be better than upkeeping the edu buildings


[14-Jul-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah it upkeeps engineers as well as scientists


[14-Jul-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, aim for 50% safety-comfort, and the rest can go hang. Also, I wouldn't bother finishing out that university. Even when completely unfunded, anything in the education basket causes a permanent shift in pops shifting up tiers. So unless you are, for some reason, wanting to encourage ENG/SCI employment here, don't build them at all.


[14-Jul-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm not the one building it, @memoryalpha is. I'm just curious at what's been going on over in the education POPI sector


[14-Jul-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, well, just as a historical FYI, the ENG boom is a recent thing. 6 months ago there weren't even 2K employed engineers here.


[14-Jul-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	the shift will be a good thing since people do use chem eng and sci. atm you can't avoid high unemployment on lower tiers and keep higher tiers


[14-Jul-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	getting pio/set unemployment down to <10% while maintaining tech+ will save a ton of upkeep


[14-Jul-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not really, since the only way that educating upwards saves upkeep is by moving employees to higher tiers. By definition the higher tiers consume far more upkeep, since fully half of a pioneer is paid for by the infinite life support need.


[14-Jul-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The higher unemployment forced happiness down, which slows/stops immigration into the planet. There is no natural immigration in the higher tiers. So pushing pops to higher tiers reduces unemployment, which increases immigration, and increases the upkeep average per pop.


[14-Jul-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you can clearly see the imbalance in pop unemployment. keeping it minimal across tiers will be less


[14-Jul-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you shift 10K employees up a tier, all you've done is increase the cost to care for those 10K employees, and by reducing the unemployment encouraged further immigration by raising happiness (happiness is suppressed by high unemployment), so unless you have some plan to vent population somewhere along the lines, all you're accomplishing by uptiering is increasing immigration and average per pop upkeep.


[14-Jul-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Frankly, a ludicrously high pioneer unemployment is almost a good thing, since it completely stops new immigration, and paying for THEIR upkeep is damn near free since 50% of it is paid for free, and the rest comes out of safety/health which is cheap to generate


[14-Jul-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	not on a planet like this. the pio/set are where most the upkeep is going


[14-Jul-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm just stating a literal fact, a settler consumes more than a pioneer. A technician consumes more than a settler. An engineer consumed more than a technician. A scientist consumes more than an engineer. Regardless of where the majority of the upkeep is spent, higher tiers consume more. Uptiering saves nothing unless you have somehow managed a targetted happiness suppression somewhere along the line (with overwhelming unemployment usually) to vent them.


[14-Jul-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	1 is not greater than 2, no matter how many different ways you look at it.


[14-Jul-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	keeping unemployment low and push into tiers with edu is cheaper than upkeeping for the same pop


[14-Jul-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, it's not. If you push 500 pioneers into a higher tier with edu, they ALL consume from the same trough. And the ones at higher tiers consume MORE.


[14-Jul-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That is not an opinion, it's the mechanical facts


[14-Jul-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	id like to see the math on upkeep with <10% across the board vs the 100k unemployed we have now


[14-Jul-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Where are those 100K unemployed going to go? That's the point you're glossing over. If you force 100K into higher tiers somehow....they don't turn inside out and fly up their own asses. They're still on the planet unless you have an employment category with tanked happiness venting them. Such as uptiering into engineers and having NO engineers on the planet so they all fuck right off as soon as they promote.


[14-Jul-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	they would migrate out


[14-Jul-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	if you tried to migrate those tiers out currently high tier would take months worth of losses


[14-Jul-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	due to the imbalance in popi and lack of edu


[14-Jul-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is kind of up to the governor if he wants to support those higher tier jobs. This is where I kind of come down on the side of "this is a starter planet". Trying to upkeep thousands of top tier employees on a starter world with dozes/hundreds of dead weight bases is not at all helpful.


[14-Jul-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	finishing 1 uni and adding some culture isn't going to break montem


[14-Jul-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not as if anyone could stop you even if they cared to =P If you're paying for the stuff, it's really not even a problem anyhow.


[14-Jul-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	not sure why anyone would want to stop shedding off the 100k unemployed


[14-Jul-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	pity the governor can't conduct census reports or construct a Bureau of Statistics building where you can see detailed population reports, buildings active on the planet etc


[14-Jul-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this way POPI can still be a money sink but governors would have increased control/precision over how taxes are spent


[14-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah that's the problem.. 1k PIOs could be 10 BMPs.. could also be 100 POLs .. you don't know that as gov


[14-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's why i would have loved for more people to take part in the survey i conducted


[14-Jul-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but with only 40 participants you can't really take conclusions from it


[14-Jul-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah...


[14-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	even though you don't know exactly the base layouts you'd know if 50% of the planet is chem. and the only building with PIOs is POLs than you can make assumptions how many PIOs work in POLs etc


[14-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	or in BMPs


[14-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	w/e


[14-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	personally id just even the tax across the types. you can't know what people are doing that's the only way to collect off everyone


[14-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	^


[14-Jul-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so generally by evening out taxes across all you're taking more PIO taxes from Chems than from everyone else, since they use way less PIOs but still pay taxes for it


[14-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	did someone save the screenshot of the old taxes?


[14-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	no but i believe there is currently a few million shortfall with current rates


[14-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	nvm found it in my screenshots


[14-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i almost gave myself a heart attack with my spreadsheet


[14-Jul-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have a copy of the old taxes


[14-Jul-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Ag:


[14-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(PIO, SET ascending etc)


[14-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	okay so a BMP would net 12,03 NCC tax fee per PE cycle with the old taxes, a POL 19,25 per PG cycle so even though BMPs employ 10 times as much PIOs they pay less taxes


[14-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	AG: 43, 43, 270, 1080, 1980


[14-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	CHEM: 55, 55, 270, 1080, 1980


[14-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	CONSt and other industries= same as agriculture


[14-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i was taking manufacturing as an extreme example here since they use 100 PIOS and POLs only 10


[14-Jul-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and i'm gonna be honest. with the taxes back down to 55 for chem, POLs become competitive again for PG here and i can save space on circe for more expensive stuff


[14-Jul-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	will do


[14-Jul-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Although they use 25 settlers, so their tax rate is 103.57, and since you can dump 3 POL's to ever 1 hab vs 1 BMP to every HAB, the actual tax revenue for POL's is better for the governor across a permitted base.


[14-Jul-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	At the current taxes, anyhow


[14-Jul-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	exactly my point Zuul :D


[14-Jul-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	BMP's are fucking wretched for taxes, lol


[14-Jul-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The way taxes are levied are just...painfully bad, to be honest. The number of workers being used should be a factor, not just the tier.


[14-Jul-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah. maybe the tax system could use a little rebalancing instead of just being based on recipe time and the ratio between differnt pops for mixed building it should also factor in how much pop is actually working in there


[14-Jul-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	well you typed it faster than i did xD


[14-Jul-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's also why, in my opinion, manufacturing taxes on pioneers should always be one of the highest on a planet.


[14-Jul-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	^


[14-Jul-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There is no other manu pioneer building that would get hit by it, you're just taxing the BMP's, and the BMP's consume huge amounts of workforce compared to literally everything else.


[14-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	since the BMP is the only manu building on PIO tier this is legit to have an increase by 25% or maybe even 50% compared to other industries


[14-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	prefab plants 80 PIOs as well


[14-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and WEL 70


[14-Jul-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i wonder


[14-Jul-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	can we model it in a way to figure out what a fair distribution of pio taxes would be? :think:


[14-Jul-23 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, because chem Pio taxes would wind up so low as to cause a mutiny =P


[14-Jul-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i mean taxes are based on a 24h rate.. so we could disregard recipes


[14-Jul-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then the CoGC would change for real this time xd


[14-Jul-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, pray it stays as chem. The tax revenue generated from POL's is ludicrous compared to basically any other tier equivalent building. Having those be more efficient keeps the tax revenue wheels from falling off.


[14-Jul-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ehh if it doesnt, i just leave montem easy as that :D


[14-Jul-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I mainly came here for the limestone but then I discovered chem lol


[14-Jul-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The only problem is CHP's are less than amazing, so tons of CHP's aren't particularly amazing for tax revenue.


[14-Jul-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So if the chem is primarily POL, it's fantastic for the governor. CHP....not so much


[14-Jul-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i figured mixing resext and refining on the same planet is really suboptimal


[14-Jul-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	circe wastes so much space because i need so much HAL and 3 EXTs are painfully big


[14-Jul-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I technically am all CHPs + 1 EXT. Just to offset my LST imports since I ship everything in from the HRT area.


[14-Jul-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And for whatever bizarre reason, LST is expensive here, lol


[14-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah I've started importing from antares/ hortus now


[14-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically I don't import from far. OZ-189 is where I pull my LST from, so....right over the border.


[14-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's just cheaper to extract from a denser source and ship it in.


[14-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	As for bases, I'm a bit of an oddball: 5x CHP, 2x CLF, 4x WEL


[14-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	TO-392d and XG-326a are both good sources


[14-Jul-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the problem is if you're logistically bottlenecked


[14-Jul-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah XG is my source :D


[14-Jul-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	really a shame TO isn't RE cheaper CLI and LST would be nice


[14-Jul-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	or better said it was


[14-Jul-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	even now with no RE im sure TO probably makes a fortune on lst


[14-Jul-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	I'm still a bit logistically plugged up on getting N up here, but I have 2 more LCB's rolling off in the next couple weeks that'll solve that little problem.


[14-Jul-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i have a liquidity issue


[14-Jul-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	how much do you need?


[14-Jul-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i expanded into markets where there was a gap weeks ago and now they're oversaturated


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so yesterday i abandoned 2 of my metallurgy exports


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not an issue here, lol. I have a "too much" liquidity problem. Little north of 11 million in liquidity.


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	cant use it for expansions?


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Buying spaceships. If the ships came faster, the liquidity would be less. I'll do another 2 or 3 bases once the ships are done.


[14-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ROI would drop significantly after a few HQ upgrades


[14-Jul-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	technically i would need to build 3 new bases and upgrade my 2nd ship with a WCB


[14-Jul-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Once those ships roll off the line I'll have 3 WCB's, 3 LCB's, and 1 podunk SCB glass ship, lol


[14-Jul-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I would invest in new players and hire them to run bases for me :D


[14-Jul-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	wait . how many ships do you have?


[14-Jul-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(once I get to the stage where permits cost astronomically)


[14-Jul-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I have....uh....7 players with base bits bought and paid for by me sending me some degree of their output


[14-Jul-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Right now? 5. 3 WCB's, 1 LCB, 1 glass.


[14-Jul-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	oh okay. i was wonderin how you maintain so many bases


[14-Jul-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	because i will probably need a dedicated WCB for the CU/AU base runs


[14-Jul-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I could do almost all of mine on 2. The only reason I need the extra is to hit MOR and ANT


[14-Jul-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm barely keeping up with 1x WCB, 1x starter and shipping contracts


[14-Jul-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Still having a starter is rough. I think my 2nd starter got upgraded before 4 months old.


[14-Jul-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah people were taking shipping contracts to lenient with me.. i'm not posting anymore


[14-Jul-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	some guy literally ignored the premium payment and flew as slow as possible because he had "24h to fulfill" ... it's a mechanical issue that you can't go sub day in shipping ads


[14-Jul-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my second ship is a starter partially because I went on a PRO renewal strike which ended ~10 days ago

[14-Jul-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Oh wow, a new gouvernor is elected and promptly the taxes on *everyone* is raised massively to pamper their chem friends. What better way to send a big fuck you to every non-chem then to make them pay for the chems that already get the 25% bonus. Thanks a lot for that clear signalling.


[14-Jul-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you guys are mad just hire more people to overturn the CoGC


[14-Jul-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@Mnementh, please show the math supporting your claim. Or you could scroll up to the earlier conversation.


[14-Jul-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I explicitly stated that I'd return taxes to rubicates levels in my governorship pitch


[14-Jul-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Re the "pampering chem friends" part - please show how this isn't levelling the taxes instead becase Chem uses so much less PIOs


[14-Jul-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@schaitr: what claim? The taxes just were raised massively, that can be easily seen if looking at the local rules.


[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Mnementh they were returned


[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@doge: COGC voting can only be done with paywall.


[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same as governorship


[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	What is normal about ripping everyone off, to pamper the guys that already got the 25% bonus. Why not let them pay?


[14-Jul-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I have pointed out the part that needs clarification from you @Mnementh


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You're free to vote for someone whose platform you support for the next election.


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Who is getting ripped off exactly, perhaps you missed the earlier conversation, or math, but on an equal tax footing, an EQUAL tax footing, chem foots the majority of the bills by virtue of small pop use per buildings vs, say, manufacturing or construction which uses more population per production line, while taxes are assessed per production line.


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or better yet, run yourself :D


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Even with an EQUAL setting, chem foots the majority of the bill


[14-Jul-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@schhaitr: chem gets a 25% bonus, why should they not pay the measly taxes for upkeep? But some want it all, the 25% and still be treated like other industries.


[14-Jul-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You do realize that taxes are assessed on base production time, right? By virtue of HAVING the efficiency bonus, chem pays more taxes per day. They DO pay the taxes for upkeep.


[14-Jul-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@Mnementh, have you worked out how much upkeeping your PIOs cost the rest of us folks?


[14-Jul-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I got to see weeks of toxic discussion hating on every non-chem and now the fuck when the chems got what they wanted


[14-Jul-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mnementh**:	Well, the last governor could make it work, why not you?


[14-Jul-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Boofucking hoo. The governor did what they said they were going to do. Reset the tax levels to the prior government that ran the planet in what was measured in YEARS.


[14-Jul-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nothing got hiked, it just got unfucked.


[14-Jul-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The last governor was bleeding because they did not do their math. Have you?


[14-Jul-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	@zul: the last gouvernor also clearly stated what they were doing and a bunch of long-term players got their panties in a twist. Now they are happy to fuck everyone else.


[14-Jul-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The last governor fucked everything six ways till sunday. What they wanted to do doesn't matter, as shown by the VAST majority of the planet giving them the heave ho.


[14-Jul-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I can see that this conversation is becoming pointless


[14-Jul-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just vote your fav governor next round.


[14-Jul-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Ah yes, because lowering taxes like I stated was a bad thing, gotta love chem guys' logic


[14-Jul-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You're the Gov who didn't understand how the POPR works......


[14-Jul-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The "chem crowd" doesn't control peoples votes.


[14-Jul-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Either the vast majority of the planet IS the "chem crowd" or everyone hated it.


[14-Jul-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Face the music, massive screws ups occurred, not wanting to accept that doesn't unfuck the situation. Now we're back to the prior status quo. We can all agree to mutually mute each other and then scream at the wall. Good day.


[14-Jul-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Fuck this. I used to love the game, as it was optimizing shit. But if you all love to declare the one and only way to play and everyone else is wrong, I guess you all can play alone the way you want.

**Crash5291**:	Oh well,


[14-Jul-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	I just want to remind everyone that taxes are a "per day" fee and not normalized by the amount of employed pop. which means high pop buildings contribute less taxes than low pop buildings. so i just visualized the PIO and SET levels for you guys and marked the high outliers and surprise the POL (chem) pays the highest taxes of all buildings.... https://imgur.com/a/9JdQbxo

Doge could potentially raide SET taxes for chem a little and reduce PIO so it balances out a bit better but honestly chem people pay their fair share of taxes already #mathdoesntlie

**BlackAnthrax**:	and since i plan to put shittons of POLs on montem i'm gonna be one of the big tax payers.. do you see me cry about it?


[15-Jul-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Gotta say, it's seems really unique here in Montem that peeps get's angry about planet having a long established role in the economy. Almost every planet with any significance has same thing going on, yet only here I've seen peeps making a big fuss about it


[15-Jul-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Would understand if the CoGC would change back and forth, as then it would be clear that planet would be in the progress of sorting it identity, but debating at this point when COGC has been clearly decided by the majority.. Like, what there is to argue about at this point.


[15-Jul-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you're right. it was no issue as long as rubicate was governing it.. but i guess everyone is a bit worked up since the last term.


[15-Jul-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	right right, true true. Ye I'm new face around here, so haven't got much of a clue about political atmosphere here or it's history. Guess I just happened to land here at the most volatile period of this planet ever ^_^'


[15-Jul-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	though I Have heard rumors that things can get bit toxic around here :P


[15-Jul-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ehh you'll live through it i guess.. i waited for so long to get a plot here. and my timing was so good that i didnt even built a single production like. although i am not sure how many people also boycotted the taxes from last term


[15-Jul-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ahhh what is wrong with PMMG randomly stopping to work T_T


[15-Jul-23 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yeeh, nah, wasn't really that concerned about toxicity. Was just what I've heard that's all ^_^'


[15-Jul-23 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	and I mean, 99% of interaction in this game is super chill, so I'd imagine what is established as being toxic here would be still mild compared rest of interwebz


[15-Jul-23 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	As a historical sidenote, Montem *was* originally a construction COGC. Then chemists started to settle in, and apparently a compromise was established in that the chemists kept Montem, and built up Danakil for construction or something. Was before my time, so this is 2nd hand information. But that's the background why there's people on Montem who oppose it's 'new' status of Chem COGC.


[15-Jul-23 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and the const/manu crowd goes like "bUt MoNteM iS a StArTeR PlAneT"


[15-Jul-23 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-23 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	celebdil metallurgists were probably also not happy that it flipped to ResExt xd


[15-Jul-23 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Guess so ^_^'. Although, of COGC get flipped for good, it ain't really that hard to pick your stuff and move elsewhere. Market itself is shifting anyway, so changing base's layout shouldn't be that foreign concept anyway

**BlackAnthrax**:	my take on that is.. usually people move to planets due to a combination of resources and cogc. and people often select their target industry by cogc. this is an effect that will reinforce the cogc long term. the only reason a cogc would flip on high pop planets is lazyness to vote


[15-Jul-23 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye that's true, though for that reason it would be totally deserved to happen ^_^

**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	just to add a bit of context to the (admittedly mild, but still) bashing of those bothered by the chem cogc status: it's not really that the chem people are a majority. it's just that most people gave up bothering to vote for anything else anymore when no matter what they do they're outvoted. understand that while the vote for governor is one player, one vote, the voting weight for the cogc is much different, and based on your worker population/types. there have been several votes in the past where the actual number of players voting for pioneers was basically double the number of players voting for chem, but because so many of those voting for pioneers were newbies (because yes, this *is* a starter planet, and pioneers is the cogc that would benefit them the most at that point), their worker pop weight was nothing compared to the established, much wealthier players who could have just a handful of them come together and outweigh everyone else easily.


[15-Jul-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	very literally the rich dictating everything for the masses.


[15-Jul-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	so yeah, the voting numbers for pioneers look pathetic now, but only because most of them gave up, and the chem voters have been more vigilant than ever for the last few elections ever since *one single time* they accidentally let a pioneer cogc slip through, something they're determined not to allow again.


[15-Jul-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	no matter how many smaller players could use that boost.


[15-Jul-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	this *isn't* a game with a huge playerbase; discouraging them from sticking around because the beginning for them is that much harder, isn't exactly that conducive to them being more likely to stick around long-term, and we can use all the players we can get. why chase them off?

***Rycidex** joined.*


[15-Jul-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of course, there is the corollary that chem had one of the worst voting densities when developed, and something like manufacturing and construction when developed have far more voting weight. Take for example my base nova Honshu where I have 4200 voting weight with nothing but manufacturing pioneers and a whopping 3 STOs that could be more votes.


[15-Jul-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	honestly I've rarely seen voting power differ that much between lower and higher workforce, since while higher tier literally has higher voting power, their building usually take more areapoints to negate this (as Zuul just gave example of ^_^')


[15-Jul-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the chem people have argued that their primary reason that they *have* to be *here* and no other planet, is because of the limestone. I *am* a purely limestone base. maxed out. my voting weight is 1800, that's all I'll ever have here. I'm the exact person they claim to be here for, and I can't vote for the pioneers that would help me either, because I permanently have lower weight than them.


[15-Jul-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but yes, those that has double dipped their permits in planet do have more say in the matter, that much is true


[15-Jul-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	in theory it would be great for all involved if I could produce more limestone, but I'm out-shouted at every turn.


[15-Jul-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and, rento, I understand you haven't seen it, but I have, many times, before the pioneer voters gave up.


[15-Jul-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, in my case I'm not arguing any reason why chem would be better, I just landed here because there already Were chem cogc strongly present, and the higher tier workforce available for my LAB's


[15-Jul-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh sure, I'm just giving you context and history


[15-Jul-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I've been here a while, I've seen a lot.


[15-Jul-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	right right ^_^


[15-Jul-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	This isnt even a good candidate for LST extraction .. it's just a convenient one. and you can't blame the players who pay for the game that they ruin your experience. anyone with PRO can vote on the CoGC.


[15-Jul-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it was never meant to be the *best* limestone planet, just a decent one, to support the construction start this was always meant to be.


[15-Jul-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	anecdote: Celebdil is traditionally a Metallurgy planet.. this week it flipped to ResExt because some people were to lazy to click on their vote..


[15-Jul-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and did I say they ruined my experience? I'm just explaining the situation.


[15-Jul-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	unless you're talking about newbies being chased off.


[15-Jul-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there's more chem voters now than before because 1 they stopped being as lazy about voting after it was flipped to pioneers just once, and 2, more people have been encouraged to go chem as "just how this place is and the pio voters are just whiners" just because things were *already* regularly going that way because of the discrepancies in voting totals.


[15-Jul-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	"might makes right" but with voting weights.


[15-Jul-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No newbie is being chased off because the CoGC isn’t aligned to them. Prom for example has a number of METALLURGISTS making STL of all things. You don’t need a matched CoGC to succeed, you just need to pick a product that makes sense in your local market and run with it. There’s no exploding heads in the Prom chat because it’s not a Pioneer planet….despite plenty of newbies doing other entry level jobs there (for some bizarre reason)


[15-Jul-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I just mean in terms of how tight resources are and how hard it is to turn a profit when you're tiny and new.


[15-Jul-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	even a little breathing room can make a difference that early.


[15-Jul-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i'm not sure whether newbies are chased off the planet.. i don't think so.. is it the most ideal planet for construction? i think not. do we try to actually harm other industries? i also think not. the game is mostly about taking opportunities and deciding for tradeoffs. obviously a critical mass arrived that voted for chem on montem.. and as i explained earlier taht day. there's 2 factors influencing what types of bases are built on a planet: available resources and cogc. a chem cogc will attact more players who want to set up a chem base.. so the pioneer space will shrink


[15-Jul-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That’s just the game. And part of it is studying the market and picking a product that makes money. Almost everyone COLIQs after learning the game and figuring out what does and doesn’t make sense for a spot.


[15-Jul-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	there is a whole thread on the forums about "starter planets need to be less attractive to mid-endgame players"


[15-Jul-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and that's basically what I mean by shouted down. anyone trying to speak up in favor of pioneers gets told basically to sit down, shut up, chem rules the planet, deal with it. is it any wonder that pio voters gave up trying?


[15-Jul-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	not like voting actually did any good anyway, when the voting weight totals don't compare at all.


[15-Jul-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it’s called having a conversation and applying logic. People disagree. Having a disagreement isn’t being told to shut up. That’s just dramatic, forgive the term, “whining”.


[15-Jul-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I'm not being dramatic or saying you're bullying, I'm pointing out that you're saying the same sort of rhetoric now that I've seen thrown around for months, often much more heatedly.


[15-Jul-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’ve heard tons of complaints, almost all centered around, “the newbies”. Never, however, any actual concrete data about “anything”. Just feels. That doesn’t matter to me in the slightest.


[15-Jul-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	however starter planets have the highest POPI in the whole universe, making it easier for everyone to exploit the planets resources and space. building up a new planet is a huge investment.. if i had the cash for it i would have done so a while ago.. but i'm not .. originally i wanted to settle in the XH space.. but only 3 bases are on there and all the players there are inactive. this makes the planet less attractive to other players... a vicious cycle


[15-Jul-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I agree that we're just discussing it, but you're still basically saying that the people who'd prefer it be pioneers, just accept the way things are.


[15-Jul-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	one thing I haven't heard from: the actual newbies themselves


[15-Jul-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which is interesting


[15-Jul-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	they're probably still trying to figure out enough to even feel like they know enough to speak up. *shrug* it's a steep learning curve to this game.


[15-Jul-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah fair point\


[15-Jul-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, of course that’s what I’m saying. What am I going to say, don’t accept it, battle for it, lose and continue on, the battle is what’s important! Anarchy! Viva le France!

[15-Jul-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	hi, welcome :)


[15-Jul-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	People are more than welcome to keep voting for what they want….that’s their right.


[15-Jul-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	howdy @Rycidex :D


[15-Jul-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yes, but you're missing the point that it didn't matter even when the number of players voting for pioneers was twice that of those voting for chem, chem still won because of the voting weight discrepancy.


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	how can that be considered fair?


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I shall solve this with my VC program


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	of course those voting pio feel a bit bullied by richer players.


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	vc?


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’m going to want a screenshot to even “begin” to buy that as an accurate statement. I have never, anywhere, seen such a voting discrepancy.


[15-Jul-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Venture Capital


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Especially when chem having a general lower voting density than other industries.


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if i actually had numbers for the voting weight, i could have told you that the voting power still might be on the pioneer side, since they are a LOT MORE


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll try and expedite this asap, once I get the liquidity


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's not possible, we can't get shots of past totals, but I promise I'm not making that up.


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it is just that if only 25% of players here are pro.. from which 50% are chem.. ofc you get a chem cogc


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've mentioned the idea a couple of times before


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	anyone else here who's been around a while, can you back me up that there were votes where the number of players voting pio was way more than those voting for chem?


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if voting was up too free players.. you'd most likely have a const or pio cogc


[15-Jul-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	doge, do you remember this? I think you were around then, I'm not sure


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	just my 2 cents


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rycidex**:	if a contract status is closes, does that mean i cant fulfill it anymore?


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	no no, that means you accepted it :)


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that means it's accepted


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rycidex**:	ah okay thank you


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, sorry, I type fast =3


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@rycidex closed means the contract was accepted.. if you mean the notification


[15-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's economics-speak ;) you close a contract when you sign it


[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I started on verdant, so I can't really come to conclusions like that @Opalesce-Spectrum


[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	gotcha, okay.


[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what time frame were you talking about?


[15-Jul-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if the contract is left unfulfilled, you'll get a notification about a contract "getting breached"


[15-Jul-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I did start on montem, and I've been here almost a year I think? so I've seen a fair amount.


[15-Jul-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	What I have heard from was that a couple of more established people getting newer players to vote pioneers by investing in their pio bases to maximise voting power


[15-Jul-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but I do remember a time when there were over thirty people voting pio and only like 16-18 voting chem, and chem still won.


[15-Jul-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and I don't mean once.


[15-Jul-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the numbers would vary, but it was a heated war.


[15-Jul-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Chamber votes aren’t meant to be a democracy. It’s meant to match the industrial output of the planet. 20 people with 200 pioneers aren’t meant to decide squat on a planetary economic output scale.


[15-Jul-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	until pio voters gave up because no push ever helped.


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	we need to find out exactly how many paying players exist on the planet


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yes, because it's only a 1:2 ratio. and chem mostly consists of settlers. what did you expect there? if every pop has the same voting right, people with SCI would always get fucked because you get like 10k PIOs to 100 SCI <_<


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can say it’s not “fair” (I hear that a lot in US politics), but it is the system.


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	popr ot-580b just look at the numbers


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think someone found out that a FIO api could reveal subscription status


[15-Jul-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	all of that makes more sense if it's a random planet that people migrated to, but it *should* be taken into consideration that it's a starter planet.


[15-Jul-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	we have 118 SCI on montem.. people investing into SCI production lines would always lose against the almost 300k PIOs


[15-Jul-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there's *going* to be a higher population of lowbies, period.


[15-Jul-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Consisting of settlers doesn’t mean much. Take a BMP, that’s 100 voting weight. A POL is…what…40?


[15-Jul-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	^


[15-Jul-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	they will *never* be able to compete with the voting weights, but do they just, not matter because of that?


[15-Jul-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	are the chem voters the main characters?


[15-Jul-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	no they are not.. but they are coincidentally the PRO players on this planet..


[15-Jul-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure they do, if there’s a huge number of them and their aggregate industrial output outweighs the total of the “fewer” larger players. That’s a vote though. It’s a vote reflecting the majority of the planets industrial output, not a popular vote.


[15-Jul-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Free players still can't vote


[15-Jul-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	confirmation bias


[15-Jul-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	people who do vote get seen whereas people who can vote but can't be bothered to vote get left out


[15-Jul-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That’s also true, a majority of the “paying” players industrial output.


[15-Jul-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	therefore we need to solve this with science


[15-Jul-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	i.e coding


[15-Jul-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	someone on APEX global chat found out a FIO api that revealed subscription statuses of players


[15-Jul-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that's a tad creepy, but I can see why it would be useful for this discussion.


[15-Jul-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm trying to get ahold of them so they could help us find out how many players are pro on the planet


[15-Jul-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's an interesting question for sure, I agree.


[15-Jul-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	please continue while I look for the guy


[15-Jul-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i know it's not enough to extrapolate.. but from the 45 participants in the survey 57% were pro.. but this is most likely a lie .. i would guess it's a lot less than 20%


[15-Jul-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why does that matter? Just out of curiosity. People either have PRO or they do not. People either vote or they do not. If they do vote, they vote for what they want. None of which is affected by how many people “are” PRO. If you want to change the rules and systems, this chat isn’t the place. That discussion is one for Molp and you can advocate for enfranchising free players.


[15-Jul-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's just that the paying players are the most active


[15-Jul-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I do want to point out that the higher taxes on chem players was a compromise proposed by rubicate himself, while he was governor, to compensate for the fact that the fewer, richer players kept winning despite being definitely fewer at the time. and rubicate himself, was a chem player. in fact the chem players that spoke up at the time were all in favor of agreeing to this compromise, and even the pio voters grudgingly agreed that at least it was something.


[15-Jul-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but the current taxes are 25% higher for chem.. which is (surprise) the cogc bonus


[15-Jul-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And chem players had a 20% higher tax rate “on the books” before he left. Which we do again now.


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	zuul, what are you talking about, "this isn't the place". it's exactly where the site owners of montem discuss things, which we're doing.


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	even the new governor is involved.


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	saying this isn't where to discuss it is absurd


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	masterdemon overexaggerated with chem taxes and polarised .. additionally failing to provide POPI upkeep led to his downfall


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The point being, there’s “nothing” any of us can do about it unless you plan to hack the game and rewrite it.


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	he ran himself broke trying to push for popi improvements for all


[15-Jul-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that's the opposite of not doing anything


[15-Jul-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i know where he's going.. blaming the "mechanics" of the game is not in our power to change.. his has to be seen by the devs


[15-Jul-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So it’s like having a town hall where we talk about how to change the way it rains.


[15-Jul-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I mean, yes, it would be good if the mechanics could get an overhaul, but in the meantime we're making do with the system we have.


[15-Jul-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's not like it's a one or the other choice, we can discuss it here and try to talk to devs about the flaws in the system.


[15-Jul-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And we can talk about the system we have until we’re all nauseus, because the system we have is the system that produces the outcome we already have.


[15-Jul-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	then his priorities weren't the right ones. no one asked for more POPI upgrades. he did everything without asking anyone and came up with "yeah i dont have any cash to provide upkeep because i built a university" or whatever


[15-Jul-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, that's true enough, yes XD


[15-Jul-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that the system is going to keep producing the same results.


[15-Jul-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rycidex**:	I have a question about this contract I just got. Its telling me to pick up 20 water units at the planet I currently am (and where my base it). its from NEO Charter Empire Official. How do I do this?


[15-Jul-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Great. So we agree no one here can do literally anything about it, and the only place that will have “any” chance of producing results is a direct entreaty to the games developer. Further conversations here are only going to create argument and anger, because no one here can do anything about ANY of it other than get pissed off, frustrated, and COLIQ.


[15-Jul-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and, I was sad that people were so harsh on him for not having everything mastered beforehand. a lot of the levers of how this stuff works, you can't even access to study and find your groove until you're in charge of them. there was barely any time to learn it. and it's not like he was in charge of when rubicate retired, but he wanted to try to make a difference.


[15-Jul-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you probably shouldn't do that quest, rycidex.


[15-Jul-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you have to have 20 water in the storage of your base (i.e. buy it on moria station and ship it here) and then the contract gets a "fulfill" button


[15-Jul-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I just don't quite follow on that there would be a need to cater any player, new or old, that stubornly will make their base against the local COGC. I mean, there isn't wrong doing that, that's fit's for the nature of sandbox game, but that other players should go against their interest because of them. Any players are well equip to move their industry to more fitting planets, and ofc COLIQ too as few week old company. This game's nature is for those that want to play fully optimize their profit involves, is that they always have situation awareness of market and planets, and occasionally be quick on their feets.


[15-Jul-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it depends. some faction contracts can be lucrative. but in generall most of them are traps


[15-Jul-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	had to click load more messages back up to the first of july , the sheetr wall of text  is lagging my APEX client rigjht now


[15-Jul-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you're basically saying, rento, that since it's been bullied into being chem instead, no one should bother even fighting it and just all lean into it?


[15-Jul-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rycidex**:	ah aight


[15-Jul-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A vote isn’t bullying. It’s just voting.


[15-Jul-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	^


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	when I say bullying I'm specifically referring to the concept that even when there were far fewer chem voters they always won anyway.


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	how is it bullying if the majority vote of economic power says we're chem? i don't get this argument


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@puplayer is the guy, waiting for a response on whether they're interested in teaching us


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it feels like bullying when there's a huge group of you voting for a thing and you still lose


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	my bad for the mix up on terminology.


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The only argument I’ve seen that even resembles that is that it is somehow “bullying” because the bigger players with more economic output have more weight in a vote about economic output.


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I'm sorry, but I find it really hard to believe that majority of voters just dropped their voting power because of this bullying'


[15-Jul-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if you want to go by player count. you'd discriminate the players that invested millions in their production chains, just to lose to a handful of beginner players which a PP1 <_<


[15-Jul-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you find it hard to believe that up to forty pio voters regularly putting their hat in the ring, always losing out anyway, wouldn't quit voting, discouraged from trying?


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure they would. For the same reason people usually stop trying to overcome the inevitable and pissing into the wind.


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i am 100% certain. if voting was open to everyone. we'd get a vastly different result. als the majority of POP we have is PIO and SET


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but... Losing voting isn't being bullied. And if you lose, game system says they aren't majority. I don't know what kind of mental gymnast I'm missing here.


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	tbh, I agree.


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and it's still 3 PIO to 1 SET mind that


[15-Jul-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In point, Montem was the planet I started on, and the planet I COLIQed off of, because one I knew the markers I fucked off to a better starter spot.


[15-Jul-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	with blackanthrax


[15-Jul-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jul-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Hey everybody, I've donated 3m to Montem's new government to kickstart it again. Let's get some good stable governance, eh?


[15-Jul-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	wuup wuup \o/


[15-Jul-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	we're doing science with your massive funding :D


[15-Jul-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just need to get someone to scrape the data off of the api


[15-Jul-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	hey rubicate XD can you do me a favor please? no one else remembers that there was a time when the number of pioneer voters were regularly way higher than chem voters, but the chem voters kept winning. :P can you vouch, just, for that being historically accurate, please? XD


[15-Jul-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that I'm not making that up?


[15-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Ah, yes, Montem's CoGC was Pioneers long ago, I don't recall exactly when but problaby more than a year ago


[15-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh no no, I mean that the cocg was chem even though way more people were voting pio


[15-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I mean, you aren't wrong, but that's not the part I mean


[15-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	oh, I see. I'm not 100% sure but I think you are correct, there were lots of 200 pio votes that didn't have much weight


[15-Jul-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	thanks :)


[15-Jul-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	CoGC is industry vote, not a populance vote


[15-Jul-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	so bigger industry gets a lot more weight


[15-Jul-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^ very true


[15-Jul-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's based on the worker weights


[15-Jul-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	not number of players


[15-Jul-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	so there can be literally more people doing a different thing, but be outvoted anyway by people with higher weighted worker pops


[15-Jul-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	hence how we have an exclusively chem cogc nowdays


[15-Jul-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and pio voters gave up for the most part


[15-Jul-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	huh, I figured it might flip back with me gone, I was always the voter in terms of worker weight


[15-Jul-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Montem's chem industry must have grown more


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	*top voter


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, nope, tons of people have gotten on the "chem is the right way to go and pio voters are just sore losers" train


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	empty plots opened up,t hat's probably why


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye the Monmtem Chem cogc is attracting new bases here from established players


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	people who've been waiting in the queue spam built bases


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	exactly, the fact that it's *been* chem for so long has become self-enforcing.


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	despite that it's still a construction starter planet.


[15-Jul-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Was


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	were*


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the newbies can't compare voting weights (if they even get pro at all) compared to the people rich enough to move here *for* the chem.


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	There are surprisingly few good Limestone planets in the universe. There are some with higher concentrations around, but they are waaaaay far away, which means logistics of actually utilizing them is very expensive and shipping-heavy. I think that alone was the reason Montem ended up Chem


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I think


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the status as a starter planet wouldn't change, it's part of the ui, it's built in.


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and upper/lower limits on taxes/ fees


[15-Jul-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Higher weighted worker pops don’t mean higher voting weight, as said ad nauseum now. Because higher tier are generally employed in far fewer numbers. Once more, the highest voting weight in pretty much the entire game are BMPs


[15-Jul-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you say that, zuul, but *here in particular*, it *has* played out that way


[15-Jul-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	time and time again


[15-Jul-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	why do you think I had rubi confirm that I wasn't making that up? that's *exactly* what happened.


[15-Jul-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That’s because it’s day 1 players with undeveloped based, not developed bases in other fields. Of course day 1 players have less voting weight. Water is also wet.


[15-Jul-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	the vote will always be a factor of both quantity and quality, even if the BMP is heavier, you'll have a lot more Chem players than BMP players on Montem


[15-Jul-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	day one players aren't likely to have pro.


[15-Jul-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If a fully developed manufacturing or construction base was being outvoted by a fully developed polymer base, I’ll eat my hat.


[15-Jul-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I bought pro on my 9th or 10th day playing the game, after some heavy consideration on pros/cons of purchasing pro


[15-Jul-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	then get eating.


[15-Jul-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don’t need to, math exists. It doesn’t cease to exist here on Montem.


[15-Jul-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	nor does historical events, zuul, why are you acting like I'm lying out of my teeth about how this went?


[15-Jul-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Sure Zuul but the amount of such bases is just as vital as the invidual voting strength of the base


[15-Jul-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	rubicate, this is why I was hoping you could confirm that there really were tons more people voting for pio than chem and still losing. I'm not believed.


[15-Jul-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	At no point does my saying a fully developed manufacturing base outvotes a fully developed chem base say you’re lying.


[15-Jul-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	you are conflating 2 entirely different issues


[15-Jul-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	you're saying that what I'm describing can't happen


[15-Jul-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	……


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	yall are just talking about different aspects of voting, Zuul isn't saying you are wrong


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	for example, somebody running Extractors on Montem, even a full base of Extractors, gets less voting power than somebody running a full base of BMP


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	1800.


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but naturally that alone won't decide the outcome, as there might be 10 extractor bases for ever 1 BMP base


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	that's my voting weight as a maxed out limestone extractor.


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	yep.


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ah, you are correct about that Zuul


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Resource extraction with extractors is not manufacturing or construction. My RE base sucks too.


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	but it also comes down to how you define "majorty"


[15-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	majority of players, Pro players, rich players, etc


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, sorry, that was specified earlier. Majority of paying players.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	sure, but it's still a matter of, people running chem are likely to be able to afford fully developed bases, vs starters who can barely get themselves up and running and wouldn't be maxed out at all.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	even aside from the question of pro.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	which is still a factor.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	new players less likely to pay pro yet.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	but still would be around.


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	nice to see COF has survived my departure, lots of unique sellers on the CX


[15-Jul-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And, again, that’s a systems issue to take up with Molp. I have no interest in oissing into the rain (e.g. fighting the system that exists instead of adjusting to it).


[15-Jul-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	industry problaby healthier with more diverse sellers


[15-Jul-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, I made a full water base on boucher and punched down the crazy water price myself a few months back :)


[15-Jul-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	to help with cof etc


[15-Jul-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	I gotta say....I am absolutely blown away that there isn't more LST flowing out of here. Even selling to those "lowball" (at least as far as local CX prices go) LM buys is 40K profit a day for an RE base with no CoGC match. The CX is even better. Kinda shocking there's not more "new player" bases just chunking up and exporting LST to market.


[17-Jul-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well there have been 12 new bases created since the 15th...


[17-Jul-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	*nudge nudge* *hint hint* Psst, LST is a good market go get into right now =P


[17-Jul-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, there's a colossal oops if I've ever seen one. Accidently let my smelting base run out of carbon.


[17-Jul-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah i only pull the LST i need for my CHP's never really looked into it beyond my needs.


[17-Jul-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A mean, a chem base on the proper product is likely more profitable....but for not having a CoGC a pure LST extraction operation is decent money with a very low upfront cost and extremely low maintenance.


[17-Jul-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Oh i agree on the low input cost, the only realy set back would be the shipping if they wanted to haul it to CX since its 183 units per startership


[17-Jul-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, that's the part that is a bit of a kick in the bagettes.


[17-Jul-23 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Just poked it into prunner and its a 372 units a day ability it would be capable of (5 experts) so any free player would be limited. and CHP's are not on their radar that early on i imagine.


[17-Jul-23 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, for a purely free base probably not something you'd run out past half the base.


[17-Jul-23 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	(forgot to mention)


[19-Jul-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I "don't" need so much LST. I mine my own LST offworld. I literally have thousands and thousands of it that I'm now piping into the BMP horde I run making MCG instead of OVE's to get rid of it. That being said, I have more than enough money to buy up something I have literally no need of in order to generate economic activity.


[19-Jul-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So....I go ahead and drum up extra activity on the LM. Gives an outlet for new players to unload small packets of material without flying to the CX, and generates a little bit of extra tax revenue to take care of the planet POPI. Doesn't sound like much, but just my antics in the last couple hours have generated just over 1K for the governor. It adds up over the course of a week if a LM becomes active.


[19-Jul-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, define "smart". I'm effectively losing money on it since I pay "far" more than it costs me to extract it, and I don't need it. I won't claim to be altruistic, as there are certainly times I'll absolutely buy out a massively undervalued listing and reissue...but generally speaking I try to moderate price fluctuations and generally stabilize markets.


[19-Jul-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Sure, it's losing you money but facilitating the market for new players like me could have long term multipliers for player retention. You're losing money now, but when I become a big dog in the market down the line I'm sure we can work out some beneficial deals


[19-Jul-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	It's a long-term investment


[19-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Also every LST extractor I build will drive up my demand for your OVE


[19-Jul-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, I doubt you'll be buying "my" OVE's here particularly often. While I maintain a near stranglehold on the HRT OVE market, I'll only be a moderating influence here, same as ANT. Hell, technically my pants are a moderating influence everywhere, since the large listing on BEN from Import-Export trading co are technically my pants that he bought in HRT, lol

**Crash5291**:	@Zuul i should of read further, i can take that LST back on CONT if you wish, though you needed it to process.


[19-Jul-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	All good. It'll get ground up eventually.


[19-Jul-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	bit late to the conversation but some of us don't just pump LST because it's boring setting up nothing but extractors, even though it's less profitable to build a taller supply chain


[19-Jul-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I know I could make more money just selling the LST but I like turning it into BSE's using my MK1's and Smelter's rather than just selling limestone in bulk


[19-Jul-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Call it practicing for later when I have an actual supply chain


[19-Jul-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It does save me a lot of running around to Moria, I can focus my expenditures on the things I can't produce myself, but it ultimately costs me money

**babipoki**:	How in seven seas do I upgrade my Stability rating if I'm constantly going from big $$$ to 1-2K cause i'm trading?!


[21-Jul-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It doesn't matter. The weightings aren't the same for each category, you can have a shit tier stability and still be A. Also, that's going the way of the dodo after the next patch.


[21-Jul-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, trading doesn't torpedo your income. When you buy something, the same value goes into your ledger as inventory as comes out as cash.


[21-Jul-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i see. i'm mostly asking cause i just want to accept this nitrogen contract and i can't cause of my rating. but i see it's probably because of provisional status of "Reliability" even though i already accepted lots of contracts and fulfilled them all


[21-Jul-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not enough it would seem. Reliability is purely based on contracts resolved. The only one you're ever stuck waiting on is stability, which can take upwards of 2 weeks.


[21-Jul-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It shouldn't take very many....I had my reliability set within a couple of days after starting.


[21-Jul-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	oof


[21-Jul-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	yeah my ratings dipped a lot when i left a corp i disliked and stopped playing for a bit


[21-Jul-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's just activity, your reliability would be frozen in perpetuity.


[21-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	honestly the only things i look at are "activity" and "reliability" .. with the next patch activity moves into the user section and reliability is calculated based off successfully fulfilled contracts.. and this will be the only metric people will be looking at


[21-Jul-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so as long as you fulfill your contracts in time, you're good


[21-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i mean i have an AAA rating despite having 2m worth of liabilities not too long ago xD


[21-Jul-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	O_O hecky


[21-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, the entire rating system is complete shit, since a person with an A can be the most tardy, unreliable vagabond ever seen. No one willingly allows their contracts to expire for obvious reasons. And reliability only gets dinged when a contract resolves as failed.


[21-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So someone could be sitting on 27K undelivered contracts and be an A reliability with the system as implemented.


[21-Jul-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	Should just add Yelp rating system :^)


[21-Jul-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or it should just give a very minor hit to reliability every time a contract is extended. That should NOT be a neutral reliability issue.


[21-Jul-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you deliver every single contract you ever take, but every one of them is late, you're not reliable. The system shows that as an A though.


[21-Jul-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i think i accepted a contract once that made me fly to another OW spot (if i remember correctly) but then I realized there's two OW spots, one is on the other side of the map


[21-Jul-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Morton.K.Salt**:	to the rating thing, I have done a little research since I got hit so bad by a coliq-during-shipment issue. It sounds like currently your rating is a factor of percentage of contracts unfulfilled and number of unique players for the contract


[21-Jul-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	I think I got hit especially hard since it was my first two contracts with one player that went unfulfilled, so that's 100% failure and 100% of players...meaning a really big penalty


[21-Jul-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	it will be interesting to see how the algorithm changes reliability when the weighting will include size-of-contract as well


[21-Jul-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	any system can be gamed


[21-Jul-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i mean if you fulfilled the majority of the contract, you don't get penalized IIRC


[21-Jul-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	I can tell you for sure that this is not true.


[21-Jul-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	Experimentally, alas =)


[21-Jul-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hmm.


[21-Jul-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	(my first two contracts, I attempted fulfillment, they coliqed so nowhere to deliver, I breached)


[21-Jul-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	now I wear the scarlet 'C'


[21-Jul-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	I'm not bitter about it. but I don't want others to underestimate how much of a pain in the ass reliability is


[21-Jul-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	I've fulfilled way more than 2 contracts now, all successfully, and that C won't budge. so it'll take some time to work out of it.


[21-Jul-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's unfortunate. i only had 2 malicious business partners so far.. but blacklisted them soon after..


[21-Jul-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	yeah, unlucky


[21-Jul-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	the worst part is the other person was, I think, trying to do me a favor by giving me some materials


[21-Jul-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	not the best way to do it =)


[21-Jul-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	it's actually kind of a fun challenge and forces me to talk to people


[21-Jul-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	since more folks than you'd expect auto-blacklist sub-A ratings


[21-Jul-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	or set their ads to A with no exceptions possible


[21-Jul-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	really? i dont thinks it's blacklisting but setting the bar high for LM ads


[21-Jul-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	you'd think right? but there are some serious folks around here. it's how I know you can see LM ads if blocked but when you try to accept you get told you're blocked


[21-Jul-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	when molp asked for feedback for the rating i think there were suggestions that the default should be C and it should be really hard to get an A and pretty easy to fall to E. but i don't remember whether that's the case in the upcoming patch


[21-Jul-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morton.K.Salt**:	yeah, it'll be interesting to see the changes. I'm only a month in or so, so it'd be my first release


[21-Jul-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	at least per my understanding canceled contracts also reduce the reliability score now. as i had the issue with people promising me to buy stuff from me long term and then never reacting on sell contracts. so when they get canceled it's a broken contract in my opinion.


[21-Jul-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and hopefully contract extensions will also lower it a bit. as it's not within the original contract's frame.


[21-Jul-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i just hope i get to repair my ships before the update hits so i can do a cheaper repair xD

[25-Jul-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I make NS and FLX in the down time (to conserve N) although its mostly for self use, but out of the 2 NS would be the more profitable i think. I mention the 2 of them as the needed LST is on planet for production. Other things that might sell well is CL although your better off making that on Circe (QQ-001b) as it has the neede HAL on planet.


[25-Jul-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

You'll need to invest some money for the T2 consumables of the settlers, but the CHP will print you  pretty penny and has a rather versatile list of recipes to work with. Don't bother with 'higher tier chem' for the fist couple months though. It's a massive cost to entry, and low RoI


[28-Jul-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, outside of workforce, tossing down a CHP is basically the same as tossing down a food processor, plus some cheap TRU.

**Owlinthesnow**:	@DogeConomy noticed you had some FE orders on the CX for low are those old orders or do you need them filled?  I could fill half depending on what they are for


[28-Jul-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh those were back from January when I first started out lol


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owlinthesnow**:	fun


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you insist I'll buy some FE from you


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah lol


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owlinthesnow**:	no its fine FE is high right now so the CX is worth it


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ahh the days where FE was 450 per unit


[28-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	construction had a solid 50% margin on BSEs


[28-Jul-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	now the stoopid MM's limits our profit margins


[28-Jul-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so basically everything else is affected by inflation, but Bfabs aren't


[28-Jul-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	good and bad


[28-Jul-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owlinthesnow**:	very true keeps things cheap for new player but disincentives experienced from selling


[28-Jul-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which is why the BSE chart often hits the market maker levels, since almost no-one can be bothered selling them


[28-Jul-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I make BSE's. What am I missing? Just bad for established players to make?


[28-Jul-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sell them. buy materials. repeat.


[28-Jul-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Agreed, have been. Just referring to the conversation about them earlier in chat.


[28-Jul-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	not sure I'm following the question, actually.


[28-Jul-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	ah - sorry


[28-Jul-23 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	No problem, the time delay on this can be interesting and confusing.


[28-Jul-23 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically, BSE's have been capped against the upper market maker for quite some time now. So as the price of inputs go up, the profits from making BSE's continues to drop, because the price mechanically can't go any higher.


[28-Jul-23 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I've been doing well with Bfab production at my starter base for my first 30 days. Been expanding production actually.


[28-Jul-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're still profitable to produce, for now, they just COULD make more money if they weren't artificially price caped.


[28-Jul-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh ok, so there is a Market Maker I haven't dug into yet that caps prices on some things.


[28-Jul-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, some things have an AI market maker, like DW, RAT, etc. Then some things have a faux market maker where the AI is just on one side of the equation, either buying or selling, but not both.


[28-Jul-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	BSE's are capped at....1550 I think.


[28-Jul-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's a literally infinite supply of them from the AI at that price, so nothing over that can be sold on the CX


[28-Jul-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Good to know. I hadn't noticed that yet.


[28-Jul-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	oh the mcgriddle username xd


[31-Jul-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	I think they should be toned down


[31-Jul-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	to be more inline with what experts provide


[31-Jul-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	When the # of users increases and the markets really start to get saturated, CoGC bonuses will basically force you to play on a particular planet for a certain set of goods if you want to be competitive.


[31-Jul-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	It seems like it would narrow the scope of the "sandboxy-ness" of the game significantly


[31-Jul-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Advertising campaigns ARE in line with experts.


[31-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Max expert bonus, 28.4%. Max CoGC bonus, 25%. It doesn't much matter WHAT the bonuses actually are, because anyone who stacks them is going to be more efficient than someone who doesn't.


[31-Jul-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh I'm being dumb again Xp


[31-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	need to get some rest, I'll try and find time to post updates/summaries on planetary happenings onto the forums when IRL slows down a bit


[31-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	Yes but they stack right? So CHEM experts stacks with CHEM CoGC. IN the long run if you want to compete in chem you a) have to be on a chem planet and b) allocate experts. There are no other options, the antithesis of sandbox


[31-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I just said that. The two bonuses ARE equal (experts are bigger) but if a bonus exists anyone who stacks it is going to be more efficient. That's like saying we need to remove luxury consumables, because anyone who doesn't use them isn't going to be as efficient and therefore not as competitive. So off with luxury consumables.


[31-Jul-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can still manufacture things elsewhere and turn a profit, especially if you're doing it to fill in a logistics shortfall. I don't extract my O with a CoGC because the position near my smelters causes it to be more effective than going in search of a CoGC matched O tap.


[31-Jul-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And it would take me MONTHS to recoup the CoGC buy in.


[31-Jul-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	I see your point about stacking, couldn't edit my prior post. The consumables seems different because it immediately applies to any professions. CoGC bonuses are more or less locked in for a long duration on a specific profession/skill (i.e. chem history here). What value does CoGC add to the gameplay? It's a funnel that narrows the opportunity for the creative routes you mention, opposed to enabling them


[31-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It should be noted that CoGC's don't exist unless they are created via player agency. The economy still spins before the CoGC's even exist. They are a feature of player agency creating a thing to make their production more efficient. You can go off and sandbox manufacture ANYWHERE in the game if you want. You just need to drop a new CoGC if you want to be competitive with the people already on a CoGC. I've already dropped 3 of them myself.


[31-Jul-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	It does seem reasonable for CoGC bonuses to exist, but they seem too drastic.


[31-Jul-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If they were less, why would anyone bother sinking millions into building them. They're not even POSSIBLE to exist until the game has moved into the electronics age.


[31-Jul-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Regardless, they don't constrict sandbox gameplay. You decide you want to manufacture something somewhere, and you build the planet out to do it. Anyone wanting to put something new ANYWHERE is going to be setting millions on fire anyhow. Building a new planet is NOT cheap.


[31-Jul-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And every single planet you see, outside the handful of starters, was built by players.


[31-Jul-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And those were 99% built by players


[31-Jul-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	I see, but in the endgame that mechanic won't exist anymore. Planets will be more or less set up


[31-Jul-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	And the incentive for CoGC to roll over is basically nil


[31-Jul-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	To clarify, "roll over" I meant change skill/prof.


[31-Jul-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why would they ever change? Why should they ever change? It's not impossible, but if your argument is simply "I should be able to build any industry anywhere and be on equal footing" that's just never going to happen. Even if CoGC's aren't a thing.


[31-Jul-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Resource availability, logistics, all play a factor in where a given industry is effective. Someone is always going to be better off based entirely on where they decide to engage in a given industry.


[31-Jul-23 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Shit, with the new HQ bonuses, simply where your HQ is located is now a non-trivial factor.


[31-Jul-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pwnce_de_Leon**:	If they don't change then what's the point of including them? This circles back to the beginning, where I claimed that it artficially restricts the available choices because competitors have to build where the CoGC favors them. 5-10% bonus would be nice, 25% is gamechanging


[31-Jul-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The point is players investing large amounts of resources to improve their efficiency. If you want to be competitive somewhere else, you CAN. You just have to pay for it. Like the other people who paid for it.


[31-Jul-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's like circling back to luxury resources. You can be more efficient if you pay for it.

**TheReal_StarMan**:	Hi guys, so I've noticed that we get a chemistry bonus on this plannet. I currently have an extractor setup that makes a little short of 9 k a day, however I might want to get into chemistry. How much starting capital would you guys suggest I need for this profession?


[01-Aug-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Simple Answer - less than 30k should be enough to buy the mats for a CHP (chemical plant) and an HB2 (settlers) - then either do the simple LST into FLX or get better return but bigger up front costs from making CL or NS


[01-Aug-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AN70N**:	Building chemical plant will cost You just shy of 20k, going by prices at moria. However, You will need building for storing settlers and their consumables


[01-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	Coming in late on the COGC talk from this morning, but I'd definitely love to see Montem, the starter for Construction (unless I did something wrong?), a construction COGC if for nothing else than to confuse new players less


[02-Aug-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but I'm eventually going to get in on the Chem juice, I'm just stubborn


[02-Aug-23 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I definitely do alright here mixing my experts even, since I'm on one base I do all my own extraction, refining, and producing within my specialty


[02-Aug-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Prun tells me I'd probably have been better off just pumping LST out of the ground and focusing on that to start, then make some Chem Plants and start in on Flux, but you don't HAVE to do that to make a profit

**Alblaka**:	@Copious Ye, the amusing part is that raw ressource extraction is fairly profitable. It has almost no costs per unit, but due to shipping being such a constraint, not many people actually produce raw, and prefer higher value production chains... hence you get insane margins on raw ores, or even LST, depite thefact there's two LST producing planets right next to the CX :D


[03-Aug-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	pretty much i find that all of the LST i produce gets eaten up at Montem without having to ship it anyway. (10 EXT) And then it makes fair profits and i dont have the hassle of  only being able to ship 183 at a time


[03-Aug-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	just interesting


[03-Aug-23 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I run 5 EXT and end up with 33.4 left over so it slowly adds up but i use it as a space filler for export loads. Toss in all the NS then fill the rest with LST.


[03-Aug-23 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	Yeah I'm glad LST isn't as heavy as Iron Ore. Had to move a couple of my extractors over to Iron Ore because I got tired of bringing over product for my smelters, even though it's technically more profitable to just pull LST out of the ground and buy my Iron Ore


[03-Aug-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So I'm one of the guys that would rather go tall than spend all day ferrying heavy stuff around


[03-Aug-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	I asked about this before but really still don't understand why Chem is the CoGC program ongiven its resources. What makes it well suited for chemical production? FLX? It seems to make more sense for it to be construction-oriented given how 2/4 of the PP1 receipes require LST and 3/4 require FEO>FE which can be refined on our neighbor. PE is the other component but we don't have C or H here


[03-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	So I'd love to see the switch to construction CoGC or at least hear compelling reasons why montem is better-suited for chem than construction :)


[03-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	Just surprising that I'm the only one voting for it


[03-Aug-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	well danakil is better logistic wise and is a near const CoGC. if you want to flip montem to const, vote const. if enough of you vote, it will flip.. but as i explained many more times. people (like me) settle on planets for their cogc .. so i will build a pure chem base here and continue to vote chem.

[03-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	@jarboot I voted const just for you hahah :)


[03-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	anything on-chem will split the vote though


[03-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	so I'll build chem instead :)


[03-Aug-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	related question - the HQ bonus is for all planets right?


[03-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	so if I want to do const, I don't need to move my HQ from montem? just keep upgrading hq here and start another base somewhere with const gcoc?


[03-Aug-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Montem is well suited for CHEM because it is local to the CX.  The next closest CHEMworld is 4 sectors away.


[03-Aug-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Totally didn't build that....


[03-Aug-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm with you Jarboot, but that ship has sailed. It'll take a pretty serious effort to change it now.


[03-Aug-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Maybe one day......


[03-Aug-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm just going with the flow because I'm too new right now to really provision any sort of change, but I'll see you again in 2024 Construction Bro


[03-Aug-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	In the meantime, I might as well have a chem plant in this empty space over here......


[03-Aug-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, construction is more or less pants on head here. You have a problem, as it were. In order to vertically stack construction in situ (which is what people really want), you need resource extraction, metallurgy, and construction. In the grand scheme of things, metallurgy or construction are both of relatively equal value if you're doing a fully vertically stacked set up. Vallis is also a starter planet, and MUCH better at producing the iron you need. LST really isn't a big deal to move around in the quantities you need for construction. So you either have TWO planets in the same system that are roughly equally as good at construction. Eventually, you could horizontally chain into dedicated metallurgy and construction bases, but if you have the shipping throughput to ship both iron AND limestone, you can just as easily horizontally integrate from vallis into danakil. So Chem is here because there's no reason to have 2 planets in the same system doing essentially the same thing.


[03-Aug-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So we have 2 planets doing two different things, and you can horizontally integrate into Danakil if that's your schtick later on.


[03-Aug-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which means FEO gets pulled and smelted on Vallis and consumed in situ. LST gets pulled from here and used in situ in chemistry, or shipped over to Vallis. And when you're ready to ship out "everything" for a horizontally integrated construction experience, you go to Danakil.


[03-Aug-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Although, frankly, Danakil is intended for higher tier PP3/PP4 construction. Hence the hordes of TEC's and ENG's there, and the 0% ENG unemployment. Because only an absolute knucklehead ships around raw iron for horizontal integration. Which goes back to the vertically integrated PP1 experience, where metallurgy and construction are of equal value....and Vallis is just plain better at that.


[03-Aug-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah if only I could go back in time and snag an open Vallis spot


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That's the only bummer, you have to pick one now as a new player.


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So not really an option for us to go Montem/Vallis, ya dig?


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh, spots open up on Vallis (and here) fairly regularly.


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I hope so, I'm watching for them


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Warehouse new base materials and hit the button when a spot opens.


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I saw them go 15 over pretty fast on Vallis


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Don't try and do it after the spots already open


[03-Aug-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Might have to wait a month at the current rate this time though


[03-Aug-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, it's not something I think is a good short term goal


[03-Aug-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or you can just join the rest of the lunatics and use Berthier/Adalina for PP1/PP2 work.


[03-Aug-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	But it is notable when the suggestion is, "Build horizontally to a full planet", as well intentioned and correct as that may be


[03-Aug-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That wasn't the suggestion. The suggestion was build vertically....and Vallis is better for a vertical build than Montem is in the grand scheme of things.


[03-Aug-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	When i started i started on Katoa, spent maybe 3 weeks basking around and reasearching what i wanted to do and where, i then COLIQ'd and loaded everything i could on one ship and sent to flying fro a day and a half to settle on Pyrgos. The other ship went to the CX to gather supplies then follow the first.


[03-Aug-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Specically, "only a knucklehead ships around raw iron for horizontal integration". If you read that as "go build horizontally"......I clearly need to be more clear.


[03-Aug-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Sorry, "Do that on Vallis when your Montem base is already established because your construction start put you here" is more factually correct to what you said, yes


[03-Aug-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Vallis isn't an option for the people asking about this without a coliq, currently


[03-Aug-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah thats a fail on dev as far as im concerend


[03-Aug-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and I found out how dumb iron ore shipping is pretty fast when I tried to buy it and sell limestone =)


[03-Aug-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, that's just part of the game. Montem was my first base 8 months ago, and got COLIQed off of. You start, you learn the game a bit, you realize where you went wrong, and then you COLIQ and do it right.


[03-Aug-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I believe you are right Zuul, and I believe what you say is 100% the better way to play


[03-Aug-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Very, VERY few people have never COLIQed


[03-Aug-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	it doesn't mean you aren't going to keep hearing the question from every month old new player who started construction, until the end of time


[03-Aug-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and none of them are gonna feel good about a COLIQ


[03-Aug-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Most people don't enjoy learning experiences.


[03-Aug-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	so it is what it is, but I bet it won't go away anytime soon as a topic


[03-Aug-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because we rarely have a learning experience that doesn't suck.


[03-Aug-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh I 100% agree


[03-Aug-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but meh, it could be avoided with a little planning, maybe it will one day


[03-Aug-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	As a green player less then a week i expect to see it. once they hit a month maybe less so.


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I know when I have a couple years of resources under my belt, I'd love to see if we can all learn a painful lesson together in a little different way, right?


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	"Rebuilding chem bases because you kept funneling construction players to a chem planet until they changed it back to construction."


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	"Sucks"


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I can't wait for a full wipe/reboot where we all start at zero again lol


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Definitely will be needed eventually with current state of starter bases


[03-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It'll become a huge divide between vets and newer players


[03-Aug-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, if I had to demolish this base and move it tomorrow....I wouldn't give a single solitary fuck. I routinely put up and tear down bases as the markets move.


[03-Aug-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, I figured as much Zuul


[03-Aug-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've literally demoed fully developed 5 expert bases just because.


[03-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm sure many of us will get there eventually


[03-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure, because the market hasn't moved. Chem supplies are in heavy demand here.


[03-Aug-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And the inputs are readily available from the CX.


[03-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	God help you and your coffee prices if chem decided to bugger off and the NS supply flew up it's own ass.


[03-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	in the meantime, let's continue to remind the month or two old construction starts they should just wipe and start over, cause it'd be a real shame if you had to do the same thing you do every day without a care in the world, right?


[03-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	=)


[03-Aug-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I agree with you and your conclusions Zuul the presentation is just poor


[03-Aug-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No one said you should wipe. Technically I suggested to move operations to the Adalina/Berthier binary.


[03-Aug-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is where the nutters like me do it.


[03-Aug-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yes yes yes, I know. So do the other construction starts. We just think that's silly and counter intuitive


[03-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It's off putting, as you might say


[03-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If this were a chem start planet, I doubt the question would ever be broached, to be completely fair


[03-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	How is it silly and counter intuitive? Are you losing money doing construction here? Then it's suitable as a construction start. The start is not the end all be all of the industry though. You can increase efficiency by moving. Prom is the IC start for victualler. I have absolutely zero food processors there though.


[03-Aug-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I don't know how to say the construction start planet not being the best place to run construction buildings is counter intuitive and make it any more clear, I'm sorry

[03-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but maybe I'm just being dense


[03-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's a terrible definition then. So....you think the best set up for the game is for the "start" to be the absolutely best most optimal location in the entire game for that activity? That would be....boring as all fuck.


[03-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	pointing to another example of it doesn't make me feel any different, as well


[03-Aug-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	not that it would be the best place to do it in the entire game


[03-Aug-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	Call it counter intuitive then, because the start doesn't mean it's the best industry on that planet. It just means it's the best "starter planet", in that faction, for that activity. Although I'd say it's not even the best starter planet for it since I think Vallis is better. What's that show, metallurgy?


[03-Aug-23 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's no such thing as a chem start.


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is...odd....since CHP's are about the same as setting up a food processor....but....that's how it is.


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Honestly you're pushing me further from agreeing with you the more you answer, not gonna lie.


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	LoL


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	No CHP start?


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	i think its due to the SET needs, where as all the others only have PIO needs


[03-Aug-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, fuel refineries have the same thing, mixed PIO/SET


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Then it can go literally anywhere without affecting new player experiences, lol


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	which should be of some minor concern, I would think


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	oh well shit, nvm then lol  (as you can tell i have ot looked at making fuel)


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	that's my main point here


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	you can be as right as you want to be, and I agree you are


[03-Aug-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but making the standard reply to a common question a one month deep delete and restart to get what you actually wanted just seems silly


[03-Aug-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	when you could just have the planets COGC's align with their starts and be done with it


[03-Aug-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, go on a crusade then. This isn't the only starter planet that doesn't match the CoGC. Boucher is the fuel refining planet for IC...it's also resource extraction. Because the suggestion for a starter planet for an industry is NOT the best industry for that planet. It's the best planet for that industry for that faction. Which is a subtle difference, but a difference.


[03-Aug-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Just imagine if you got the kit you need to start as vit, chem, whatever BUT you had to pick a planet to start on and did NOT get prime spots and had to take population into account


[03-Aug-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and yes, some of them are mixed, that is a developer level change that should probably happen


[03-Aug-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and yes Zuul, welcome to the crusade


[03-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm telling you, the idea is bound to multiply just because of how the game is funneling people here.


[03-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Lock the COGC on starts and also lock to 1 permit max then.


[03-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I know other people who make BFAB's on planet, I'm not the only one


[03-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	we shall rise up!


[03-Aug-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And there's nothing wrong with that. There are people who make fuel on Boucher despite it being best at extracting H2O.


[03-Aug-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There are people who make fucking STEEL on Promitor.


[03-Aug-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I also know a b fab maker on planet, and he doesn't give a shit about the COGC lol


[03-Aug-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I think one permit max on all starters combined should definitely be a thing, but until it is I'll abuse it with the rest of you


[03-Aug-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why would that even matter?


[03-Aug-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Because it's a vet only thing with limited permits per planet.


[03-Aug-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What possible influence would locking starters to 1 permit other than screwing new players by forcing them to drop a new core module earlier?


[03-Aug-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I don't mean 1 permit area, I mean one planet


[03-Aug-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	not able to do multiple starters as one person


[03-Aug-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Single permit per planet everywhere for me no dual or tripples currently


[03-Aug-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	so no being the OG vets with a base on every starter when all the people who are joining up are forced to pick a single one. Vets should be the first to have to expand out, not the last.


[03-Aug-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	at least in terms of game design


[03-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh, again, spots open up. I'm not an "OG vet" by any stretch of the imagination. The vets are almost 3 years old. I'm not even a 3rd of that. I have multiple starters.


[03-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	it's that or unlimited permits for starter bases and limits on others, in terms of number of planets. Still max 1500 area


[03-Aug-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What?


[03-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can't go over 1K area on a base. As an FYI.


[03-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	As in there is always a space on each starter planet for everyone, if you want to you could start a new base there regardless of population


[03-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	sorry, I'm new so some of my numbers get mixed up


[03-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but you get my meaning


[03-Aug-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	keep current max base size, unlimited only in terms of people who are allowed to build there, starter planets only


[03-Aug-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don't. Because I think almost the entire argument you're presenting is false. Your argument seems to revolve around the idea no new player can get multiple starter bases. They can, and they do. Hell. Vile Adventurer started just a couple months ago and had Prom/Montem by the time he was your age.


[03-Aug-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I know, I am doing the same


[03-Aug-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	What I am saying is, if the game gets popular and succeeds, that is going to be a problem


[03-Aug-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	which is why I mentioned me abusing it with you while I can


[03-Aug-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	as long as it stays small, sure, no big deal ever


[03-Aug-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why? If the game gets popular and "succeeds" multiple planets are going to be maxed out and people will be forced to spread out by virtue of the game getting "popular"


[03-Aug-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	we can all have our starter bases and eat them too


[03-Aug-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	I started on Prom and simply got bamboozled by this spreadsheet which said Montem was the best construction start https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUmjz8XNgLJ6y_XJa_hn7JPc9FWftqR2Lx9McZi-X-0/edit?pli=1#gid=0

[03-Aug-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	Either way I'll count it as a lesson of not doing enough research, will continue to vote for construction programs on montem, and will diversify to other planets :)


[03-Aug-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Problem with stuff like that sheet is likely they are old


[03-Aug-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yes, but not the vets sitting on the starter planets. They get multiple great, unbeatable and now unmatchable locations just for getting here first. It's ok with the universe at large, but with starter planets in particular I could see it being a huge issue.


[03-Aug-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	How are they great and unbeatable? Montem isn't the best chem planet in use right now by a long shot.


[03-Aug-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	the locations in relations to CX's will become premium the more people join


[03-Aug-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	they are close to CX's


[03-Aug-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	all of them


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	....except that if the game "succeeds" and floods planets, we get NEW CX's to be close to.


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	unless there is a change with the way CX's work


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	which would also solve the problem


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yes, that would be another possible solution


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	This is the problem with new players thinking everything is a fucked wreck. Please note, this iteration of the universe did not start with all the currently available CX's.


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but eventually it will require some attention, yes?


[03-Aug-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I don't think that at all


[03-Aug-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but I'll not sit here and just agree with you because I'm new


[03-Aug-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	Personally I'm not planning to settle anywhere besides systems with active CXs because if the game grows and the devs do not either 1. create a method to expand plot limits or 2. create liquidity in other new CXs, land on these types of planets is the most valuable resource due to its scarcity


[03-Aug-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I very much like this and think it has tons of potential


[03-Aug-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, but you just said adding CX's would solve the issue if the game expanded. And CX's have been added to the game, and can be.


[03-Aug-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So....what's the issue you've been arguing over if the solution already exists?


[03-Aug-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Zuul, if you expect me to know that before I start talking with you, why didn't you know to just tell me that to begin with?


[03-Aug-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Personal foible. I investigate before proclaiming an issue to exist.


[03-Aug-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I have done a ton of investigating, this is part of that investigation my man.


[03-Aug-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	The information on this game isn't necessarily easy to find always, particularly details like that


[03-Aug-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So sorry for not knowing that, thanks for educating me my man


[03-Aug-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, jarboot. CX's aren't that big a deal in terms of location. You don't want to be 5 days away, but none of the faction flagged systems are particularly far from their associated CX.


[03-Aug-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'll make sure not to talk until I can never miss a factoid =)


[03-Aug-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	Ok. Maybe I'm not understanding the FF/SF travel to some extent


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	But my point still stands that the most valuable resource in this game is plots on popular planets, especially if the game continues growing and plot limits don't change


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	sorry Jar, we apparently just need to read more and we'll get it


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm off to do some of that


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	If not for juicy discussion on planet COMG ;)


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why? Popular planets are popular because people are lazy, not because they're ideal.


[03-Aug-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Popular ones are "easier" to hop in and get running, but better options do exist...if you care to build them.


[03-Aug-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	You're right I guess I'd mean "optimal" instead of popular. Like there's got to be planets out there with 216/418 plots available which are undeniably the best planets for something, and if the game grows those plots would be taken


[03-Aug-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's a reason why the chem planet I built keeps having older larger players move in, but it didn't have a single colonist on it just a few months ago.


[03-Aug-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	If there are finite number of planets at least


[03-Aug-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's nothing that's undeniably the best. There are things that might be the best for specific sets of circumstances. There are things that might be the absolute best once you have so many ships that you literally will never care about logistical issues again.


[03-Aug-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But that's not something your average player is likely to encounter in the lifetime of the game.


[03-Aug-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Go out and look around the margins. Don't go too far because there's not enough people playing yet for that. There are opportunities to build new planets, where collections of resources and environmental conditions create ideal situations for horizontally integrated production strings. It takes some hard work and a healthy investment to realize it, but if you care to, there are far better places then the starters. The starters are simply "convenient".


[03-Aug-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The other factoid you might be missing, when saying the CoGC should be locked to the starter planet designation. Starter planets come with no CoGC's. There's no such thing as a CoGC in the entire game when it starts. Those are after the fact player addons. Everyone started out and survived with no CoGC. Not having the CoGC isn't a penalty....it's the same start all those vets had.


[03-Aug-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	also this discussion with new players is also done in the forum for  quite some time. new players will be at a slight disadvantage nonetheless, as their starting money does not account for inflation. players decide per vote of economical power how a CoGC forms. I also feel like some planets I settled on could be better with a different CoGC, but the majority seems to do it differently than I do. Celebdil is the highest density ALO source in the Moria space, yet it is not high enough to feed lots of SMEs with only few EXTs. so I miss out on 25% more ALO, because celebdil is Metallugy. I slapped 14 EXTs on Celebdil in order to feed my 18 SMEs on Vallis, just to cover my AL demand.


[03-Aug-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	as a new player, I think the majority of the disappointment comes from the fact that the most efficient decision is to COLIQ and restart differently. But it's all for fun and games, so you want to stick it out, and realize that you build half a starter base on the wrong planet that is probably worth demolishing to refocus on chem. Certainly not the end of the world, but it's a nagging feeling. That being said, if the new player experience is disappointing, maybe I'll see some spots open up on Vallis :)


[03-Aug-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah I have the feeling there is a train of us waiting to jump on Vallis open spots


[03-Aug-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Is my ticket for finding out which CX's came when just reading through the release notes from the beginning?


[03-Aug-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Kind of curious which ones were the starters and when the new ones came, where they were put.


[03-Aug-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I think I know, it seems pretty obvious on the surface


[03-Aug-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	But I wouldn't want to ASSUME, would I Zuul?


[03-Aug-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Those with the 1s are the starters


[03-Aug-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	NC1, IC1, AI1, CI1


[03-Aug-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, that's what I figured. Thanks.


[03-Aug-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Zuul, the idea that Arclight and Hubur being added later would help new players is kind of funny. Is that the kind of new CX you are talking about clearing up room when we are all sitting on the quad of inner starters?


[03-Aug-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeOmy**:	Is there a way to see COG on an item that I mine/make/extract?


[03-Aug-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	The construction tab tells you what each building is categorized as.


[03-Aug-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	And clicking on the item square will tell you what building it comes out of.


[03-Aug-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	In game no, you would have to figure your inputs to get that.


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeOmy**:	Blah, thanks Crash


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Or you can go play in Prunplanner and see


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh ok I fail at the acronym game


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	https://prunplanner.org/


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	What does COG mean in this context? Cost of Goods?


[03-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	yup


[03-Aug-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Or some use COGM


[03-Aug-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Cost of Goods Manufactured


[03-Aug-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	I thought you were talking about something related to COGC's 🤣


[03-Aug-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	is what planner will show, i have not checked its accuracy but i would be supprised if it was off by a notable amount


[03-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	You do have to have your FIO seed to use the planner like that without manually inputing prices though


[03-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Or at least I did


[03-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Just in case your wondering that is to make CU on wb-929b


[03-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I have not checked what pricing its using, i just expected it from the set CX, in this case that would be Moira Average i htink i have set


[03-Aug-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Set to use sell price for buys, and Buy price for sells so worst case pricing generally. Is how its set for me


[03-Aug-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Jumping into the COGC conversation: I started on Montem. I started as Vic. Switched quickly to Construction (not coliq - just teardown and build different buildings) I thought Construction here was a great way to start even though the COGC was chem


[03-Aug-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I build a bunch of my own buildings, got some decent cashflow, and then started doing some of the settler level chem and built a PP2


[03-Aug-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	and continued to build a bunch of my own fabs to make my own buildings


[03-Aug-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Here's the thing about Construction on this planet though - it's only really useful with a PP1


[03-Aug-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah it's solid for PP1's, and it's definitely not a terrible idea for the newer players. I've had good success with it.


[03-Aug-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I want my 25% though and I'm gonna rabble rouse till I get it


[03-Aug-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	=)


[03-Aug-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	If you start looking at the mats needed for PP2/3/4 they need a whole bunch of .... you guessed it .... Chem made mats


[03-Aug-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It would be cool if the game offered a chemistry start though


[03-Aug-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Ain't that the truth


[03-Aug-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I was surprised there wasn't considering the Flux supply chain


[03-Aug-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Montem seems good for at least Flux and NS :]


[03-Aug-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there might be a flux oversupply lol


[03-Aug-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Not sure what else yet, as I haven't been at it for too long


[03-Aug-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	it's like it Montem was a chem start planet and people came here planning to make Flux we'd have a bunch of happy nerds


[03-Aug-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	"I get a 25% bonus to what I wanted to do? SWEET!"


[03-Aug-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	What do you make? I looked into it and decided I wanted supplier bases before I go deep on Chem here


[03-Aug-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'll probably throw up some flux production to supply my refineries that are Step 2 of the Construction 5 Year Plan


[03-Aug-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but until I can send inputs in I didn't want to be dependent on a fickle market


[03-Aug-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I can't make enough CL, PG, EPO, NR, TCL to feed my construction buildings on Danakil


[03-Aug-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Good to know. I hadn't looked into Danakil yet.


[03-Aug-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I know some of the other chem folks push out NS/DDT nonstop to feed their farm planets


[03-Aug-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	NS was one of the ones I was looking at being super profitable


[03-Aug-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I just didn't like the idea of buying all my inputs


[03-Aug-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Copious FLX for Refineries?


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Danakil is going in the bank of places I want to mess with


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I meant Smelters


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	my bad


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	but I started with PP1, 2, 3, 4 here - slowly building up until I started expanding out to more bases


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Oooh okay


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	is Danakil construction mostly because of proximity to chem? was slightly surprised to see a sulfur/water planet as const


[03-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I think it's because it doesn't matter, they don't get any inputs there


[03-Aug-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	they just stack construction buildings and import everything


[03-Aug-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	if the cash flow is reasonable, the fact that the CX is in-system makes it really easy to buy all the relatively light inputs you need


[03-Aug-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and yeah, chem is easier to import in that area


[03-Aug-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	if I wanted a feo+lst bfabs const base, it would be... ironforge?


[03-Aug-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	well, I like TO-392d for that, but it's a little more expensive to get started on


[03-Aug-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I have a base there with EXT, SME, and PP1 that makes a stupid amount of BBH and BSE


[03-Aug-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	ahh thanks! still struggling to figure out how to combine the different mapsearch utils


[03-Aug-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	It's 1 hop from here, and has much higher FEO and LST extraction


[03-Aug-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	maybe more expensive but if I can't start vallis that seems like a good place to smelt


[03-Aug-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	but requires HSE and INS to make buildings


[03-Aug-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	idk what's happened to vallis recently, so many new metallurgy players


[03-Aug-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	HSE.NC1 (one per building) INS.NC1 (you need multiple INS per building depending on area)


[03-Aug-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	and again - even though my primary output of TO-392d Is hundreds of BBH and BSE - it has metallurgy because the bottleneck is turning the FEO into FE


[03-Aug-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	I was a new metallurgy player, made the mistake of picking montem so now I'm in it for chem haha


[03-Aug-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	but now I get to plan my next bases and want some metallurgy and construction just for fun


[03-Aug-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	seems like a good plan - I'd start with Danakil since it's easier to build on - and once you can make some INS/HSE look into TO-392d


[03-Aug-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	free WCB ship available for hire (the entire cargo bay)

**DogeConomy**:	going to moria, now free space on cargo is 2620t/870m^3


[03-Aug-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Price of shipping = 2.5 per tonne/m^3


[03-Aug-23 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	yeah i'll fill it


[03-Aug-23 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	oh nope, WCB i wont fill lol


[03-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	what do you mean? shipping is shipping


[03-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you don't have to fill the entire thing xd


[03-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	i meant i dont have enough to fill the ship lol


[03-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh lol


[03-Aug-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	was thinking NS was 1m³ per unit for some reason


[03-Aug-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	All good ship departed will arrive in 10hrs roughly


[03-Aug-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Nice, thanks!


[03-Aug-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Well thats that, all the parts for the next 3 HQ levels are ready to depart MOR. 14,15, and 16. Into needing Afabs for upgrades now


[03-Aug-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	@Copious I didn't say Hubur and Arclight helped anyone. I said CX's "can" be added to the game if we ever needed more CX's because the population increased....because that was the doom and gloom being prophesized. If the game ever picked up more users we'd collapse under the lack of real estate near CX's...or something.


[03-Aug-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	Given this discussion: If you can't beat them join them I guess ;)


[03-Aug-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	For as long as that's an option, that is. 🤣


[03-Aug-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I don't think it's doom and gloom to point out that things are filling up and the current meta isn't good for growth long term. You'd like to see more incentive for veteran players to be the ones spreading out, rather than hanging up on starter planets because they are closer to the main trade hubs.


[03-Aug-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	*ganging up


[03-Aug-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Eventually, what you are suggesting would lead to newer players being the first to have to spread out, which just seems backwards. It's playing out in front of our eyes in a lot of ways.


[03-Aug-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	The COGC discussion from earlier being a great example.


[03-Aug-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If you like burning money so much, why aren't you colonizing the rim? You said yourself it's possible for established players to set up anywhere


[03-Aug-23 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So why aren't they? Why are they turning starter planets next to CX's into COGC's that don't have a start? Because that's the meta and as long as they can use their superior resources to sit on close by planets why would they do anything different?


[03-Aug-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I myself am an example of this. I'm absolutely looking at almost full starter planets because I know that is a limited resource and many of those planets have a location advantage that can not and will not be overcome.


[03-Aug-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Unless it's addressed thoughtfully that'll continue until every planet is Promitor, where it's your first base or you don't get on, while the COGC is run by vets with supply chains based on having bases at multiple starters nearby


[03-Aug-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It's an alright status quo for you, but there is a reason you keep hearing people ask about it and then get a bit frustrated when they start digging.


[03-Aug-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Not doom and gloom, just an honest assessment of the situation. I look forward to getting myself booted off these starter planets after I set up on 4 of them. 🤣


[04-Aug-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The problem is, was, and for the rest of this universe, will be, that there's no incentive beyond "lol let's do it" to actually settle outwards. Regardless of how well-integrated your supply chains are, you'll interact with the CX anyways. And given the way flights work, even with an internal market you'll probably run the hub over the CX simply because ships take less time to fly to/from a CX, than a planet. So, whatever you, do CX's are a very real locational advantage. Voila, every planet next to a CX suddenly becomes very attractive, which just happen to be starters.


[04-Aug-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	If there were (as was originally intended, but didn't work out due to coding errors) more valuable planets far from the CX, we would see more rimworlds. So, maybe next universe.


[04-Aug-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jarboot**:	They could always just fill in empty gaps in the system!


[04-Aug-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
***ChefStab** left.*


[04-Aug-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why aren’t I settling the Rim? Because that’s GTUs thing, and they’re insane. I do however build new planets at a “reasonable” distance from the CX. I find the idea that there’s no incentive no matter your logistics chain to be laughable. Having fully integrated supply chains of 4-6 bases 1 jump from each other that only require one trip from and to the CX per run is significantly more efficient that the pretzels I see people trying to tie them selves into by purely attaching themselves to CX systems. In fairness, if you are a FREE player and can have no more than 6 bases, than staying near the CX has merit…as we all know however, this game is not designed around free players. Free players are treated as, more or less, a trial edition.


[04-Aug-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There’s a significant difference between settling Kinza (lunacy) and settling the OZ189 system (an uninhabited system squarely between MOR/HRT) with a great HAL/LST/FEO source, and a cheap barren planet to put a chem planet for horizontal integration right next to existing construction sites. Somehow that went untouched the entire game, but now that I brought it online….it’s growing quite nicely and many vets are looking or have already put a base there. There are opportunities to expand outwards. You just need to expand “slowly” instead of jumping half way across the Galaxy in one go, because that’s dumb as a bag of hammers.


[04-Aug-23 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I think an issue there is that your location is irrelevant to anyone but the people settling ont he planet, which will never be as many as are active at a CX. As in: Anything you do not trade over LM, or integrate vertically, you will have to ship to CX to sell, anyways. Therefore might as well stick to the CX to begin with. Though I agree that finding more effective arrangements of ressources, than those present at a CX, is a good reason to set up shop. Beyond the whole 'lets go colonize' RP reason that GTU seems to be running on :D


[04-Aug-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I feel like the suggested concept of Corp-funded CX would solve the issue. If you can put up a CX in your hub system, you suddenly have a viable platform that foreign traders can easily browse and interact with, and thus remove the locational isolation.


[04-Aug-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because the entire point of those enterprises is that you DO integrate. You don't "have" anything to ship back to the CX except the final products. You don't care what your neighbors think or even if they exist. It's the difference between delivering packages to 10 houses on the same street that's 20 miles from the hub, or delivering to 10 houses that are 5 miles from the hub but 3 miles from each other.


[04-Aug-23 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Hey not at GTU were not insane just . . . Ambitious lol


[04-Aug-23 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is why it's not really viable for free accounts. Again, though, this game is not designed around the severe limitations of free (trial) accounts


[04-Aug-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Even GTU's endeavor isn't "entirely" madness when looked at honestly. I just haven't looked at the potential production chains and resource concentration numbers. Their entire schtick is to create an ideal ship construction pipeline. So they're not sending ANYTHING back to the core CX's except for finished ships.


[04-Aug-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But I haven't actually looked at/crunched the numbers to see if it will yield better results than jumping all over hells half acre in the core to put the ships together. I'm skeptical, but I can't offhand disregard that they may be right.


[04-Aug-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Its a hard go with some older players dropping out caused major chain issues, So V2.0 shall come along in time. Hardest part with Kinza is the stuff you need from a CX, it all has to be shipped in and thats a 3 day venture if your not concrened about fuel.


[04-Aug-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, that's why I'm not sure if the idea has any merit. You have to self-produce everything, and I'm not sure if there's enough viable real estate to set up hyper efficient production of...well...everything.


[04-Aug-23 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I suppose you could get away with importing product that's like .001 m3/t and not locally producing that, as a single trip would provide an immense amount of material....but....yeah


[04-Aug-23 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed, i have not spent much time looked at the local systems here and sorting out what can be done. I am sitting on almost 30 million in assets on Kinza and NOva Unalaska, dedicated to GTU endevors out there. Problem i see first off is that to make it work you need to eliminate the single points of failure so each line would need a twin that was the biggest issue currently.


[04-Aug-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you don't "need" to eliminate them, you just need to not have them fail =P


[04-Aug-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	true but we can't controls the real world that great lol


[04-Aug-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Without a CX also slows things down a fair bit in getting and selling supplies.  SO MANY CONTS its nuts lol


[04-Aug-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I know that if you could build a CX at 100 million in cost there'd be one ou there lol


[04-Aug-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, that's why when I refer to horizontal integration, I mean horizontal integration in a geographical sense. Still vertical integration for the company, as that eliminates the points of failure.


[04-Aug-23 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which would, of course, limit participation to companies of a certain size....so not likely what GTU is aiming for with it's hordes of newer players =)


[04-Aug-23 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah, and look at the production chain for shipbuilding just a few things lol


[04-Aug-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Its a fine line though, younger players or atleast low HQ players will be a simpler setup, then a player grinding on HQ 25...


[04-Aug-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That's why I think maybe if there was more incentive for more established players to spread out, it might help push people out slowly. As it is right now, every system just further pushes people together, and it's a shame to see the meta so narrow.


[04-Aug-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	A good start would be one starter planet per person, that would eliminate, what, 8 or 9 duplicate inner planet choices?


[04-Aug-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That alone would encourage more population further away from CX's, with no other decisions or changes necessary.


[04-Aug-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It's a small thing, but it is a thing


[04-Aug-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm spreading out already xd


[04-Aug-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, you have to eventually no matter what if you get to some of these leaderboard number of bases


[04-Aug-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	31 is a lot of planets


[04-Aug-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It still wouldn’t spread people out. There are hundreds of worthwhile planets within spitting distance of the CXs. You don’t have to leave the core areas at all. That’s why it’s a narrow focus. Nothing to do with the starter planets.


[04-Aug-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, hundred”s” might be a stretch, but 3 figures for sure.


[04-Aug-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You could be double the size of the top leaderboard guy, which would take into decades to get to, without ever needing to leave the core area. Starter planets or not.

[04-Aug-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It might not push people out of the inner core overnight, but it would create some movement


[04-Aug-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Definitely need more to make a large dent though, this is true.


[04-Aug-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Why is it a step in the right direction? It's just how things work. Whether it's in the game, or the real world. People congregate. It's why we have cities and not just a nice even population distribution. It's ludicrously expensive to build higher tier POPI which is needed for any kind of advanced workforce. You have to have concentrated population density to afford that. Spreading people out just means a lot of worlds that can't do anything but basic production. You're fighting a battle that not only doesn't "need" to be won, it shouldn't be.


[04-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You're new, you don't know anything about planetary management beyond your own base (I assume, anyhow, maybe I'm wrong). But anything above and beyond maintaining settlers becomes rapidly expensive. ENG/SCI is just plain painful.


[04-Aug-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Consider that the first LEVEL of library (not the more expensive university), and god forbid the higher levels, is over 2 million cash by itself just to fire it up. Each additional level is 20% again on top of the previous one. And the ongoing upkeep costs are sickening.


[04-Aug-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	While there are certainly, at this point, elder companies with fields of EDC/IDC printers who could just afford to throw down almost anything they want....most of the mortals have to work within the constraints of financial sanity.


[04-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	leaving for MOR soon with 150t / 400m3 space available if anyone needs shipping


[04-Aug-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Sidenote that I specifically ejected not to bother with EDC printing. I just don't think it's a good system, and I'll therefore avoid interacting with it. Directly at least, can't do much about EDC printers buying my produce in the end.


[04-Aug-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
***FaeThorn** left.*


[04-Aug-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm EDC printing right now, but in rather small quantities, mostly because I needed to stop ENG/SCI bleed out on my electronics rock, but I'm not ready to start making ship parts yet. So the SE/SL make their EDC/IDC while my CLR's knock out electronic bits until I can get the EDM/SCA, etc, etc in place.


[04-Aug-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	There are many parts that lead to the dark side of software developement.

[04-Aug-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	damn it


[04-Aug-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh, it's not really doing any favors. I have buyers for CLR products that are clearing more profit than EDC printing. So I'm more or less losing money....but I need the SE's there for later, and I don't want the ENG to emmigrate away in the meantime due to high unemployment.


[04-Aug-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The issue isn't the profitability of EDC, it's the point you specifically add money to the economy. Taking 100k from a player to provide him with 100 something is fine. Spawning 10k because infinite MM NPCs is not.


[04-Aug-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(to me, but the devs have other opinions, so there goes that)


[04-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm surprised MM buys exist outside of basics needed to run a base


[04-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I get it with things like DW and Rations, it'd be detrimental to the health of the game if those had major hiccups in production


[04-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Crash5291**:	I think the MM might be better of following the trend, based off the 180day trades that way it cant sit on the mm forever it would slowly adjust upwards


[04-Aug-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You have to add money to the economy. It's not a "you shouldn't", or a "it doesn't matter", it's a "hard currency MUST be added into the market constantly".


[04-Aug-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If the money supply remained static, then the game would experience hyper deflation. Period end of story.


[04-Aug-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The question is how MUCH gets spawned in.


[04-Aug-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So if there "wasn't" IDC/EDC and other assorted "cash printers" the game would have had it's cash supply fly up it's own backside. Especially since there are a MULTITUDE of valves removing currency from the game at all times.


[04-Aug-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Zuul I feel like you should just have an entry on the website of how the game works to avoid anyone making the mistake of thinking otherwise


[04-Aug-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's not how the "game works". That's how an economy works. If the supply of material goods increases, but the cash supply remains static, then there is deflation. Similarly, if the supply of goods remains static, but the cash supply increases, you have inflation.


[04-Aug-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if the supply of material goods increases, and god forbid somehow "decreases" (in our case, because there are outflow valves), then you have an absolutely WICKED amount of deflation.

**Zuul**:	erm, cash supply decreases, that is


[04-Aug-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I understand that, but does that mean that all MM's are inherently good and there is no discussion to be had?


[04-Aug-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	or was that not the intent of your very final sounding answer to the discussion?


[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It means that you were talking at opposite purposes to Alblaka who was talking about selling goods to the MM and generating cash supply, and you were talking about buying goods FROM the MM, which means I wasn't even addressing you at all since I'm talking about cash supply being added to the market.


[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's a mute button. You're free to use it.


[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Except you're not foiling me, because we aren't even talking about the same thing. I agree with your point on the BUYING FROM THE MM and have repeatedly at various times.


[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	This way at least I get something out of it


[04-Aug-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**nanny**:	@Zuul is the chem planet you built that you're referring to oz189c? what's the reason that makes it good?


[04-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Like all things in life, location location location. It's in the same sytem with a HAL and LST tap, the foundation of pretty much all chemistry. Danakil and Adalina/Berthier are both practically on top of it, making it ideally situated to provide PG/EPO to the construction process.


[04-Aug-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That and it's not an utter flaming hellscape. Pretty much every HAL tap is a desolate wasteland. So it's nice having a chem facility where everything ISN'T on fire and you still have ready access to HAL.


[04-Aug-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And most chem bases are vertically integrated into a HAL tap.


[04-Aug-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nanny**:	gotcha thanks!


[04-Aug-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If for some reason you're going to drop a base there, yell at me first so I can make sure you'll have a workforce.


[04-Aug-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I run pretty tight margins on available workforce. If I know you're coming I can run a program to get your workers in.


[04-Aug-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	heh, I was just looking at oz189a for a mix of bfabs and HAL (to supply montem)


[04-Aug-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nanny**:	will do, I probably won't any time soon since I have montem


[04-Aug-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**nanny**:	"and why is our credit card statement filled with transactions for kombucha??"


[04-Aug-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But yeah, Oz was originally meant to be a personal pet project. Oz-189a actually used to BE a chem CoGC (another one of the many vertically integrated HAL sites). I may have helped flip it to resource extraction....and then people just kept moving into C. Originally it was me and 2 other guys who I asked to tag along just to generate a larger batch of initial pioneers for faster planet growth.


[04-Aug-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Now theres 13 or 14 people there and I know of at least 4 more planning to move in so far. My personal pet rock became....a community rock, lol. Frankly, every rock I've set up has attracted "someone" else to set down there. No personal space for me, lol

[05-Aug-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Volume vs input cost. A planet will with HYF's can produce more RAT fodder than multiple planets stacked with FRM's.


[10-Aug-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	erm, planet with HYF's. It's late and I'm tired, lol


[10-Aug-23 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	ah, I see. That calculation isn't obvious from PRUNplanner


[10-Aug-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, look at ALG. ALG effectively replaces BEA. BEA you get 10 per day on 30 area at base speeds. ALG is 53 per 30 area on base speeds.


[10-Aug-23 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or VEG is at least apples to apples. That's roughly 60 per day compared to 9, or something like that.


[10-Aug-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	interesting


[10-Aug-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There is something to be said for continuing to grow GRN on FRM's if you can manage it, since, while MAI does output more volume out of a HYF, it's not a massively stupid difference like protein/triglyceride ingredients


[10-Aug-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Long story short though, 500 area of a HYF base will handily outproduce a 1K FRM base, and that would even be true on Prom where the FRM's are getting a nice fertility bonus and the HYF's are not.


[10-Aug-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	On the flipside, HYF's don't give a damn about bad fertility...or none at all. You can grow on whatever god forsaken hellhole you please.


[10-Aug-23 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Right, so on a planet like Harmonia in ANT space, it might make sense to combine FRM and HYF


[10-Aug-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I think I get it. I can do the maths when it's time for me to get more base permits


[10-Aug-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	HYF makes sense when your ready to setup a FP bace and process it all, even better if the HYF and FP are a very short flight apart. as hauling HYF output is bulky. i run a HYF base of Circe, with Expets 5 i use 65 NS per day growing HCP/MAI to burn.


[10-Aug-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	the HCP/MAI is traded on planet and burnt on planet to remove the shipping burden. Just have to haul in water, NS and food.

[11-Aug-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	It's important to keep in mind that the HYF vs FRM comparison depends a lot on where you are at in your empire. The HYF can do way more per space per day, but it also takes ridiculous amounts of water compared to the farm which is a logistics problem you might not be set up to deal with yet


[11-Aug-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	The FRM doing merely 9 VEG a day only uses like 7 water a day - vs the the 2 HYF on the same space using 160 water a day for 60 VEG


[11-Aug-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes. My personal recommendation when you first add HYF's to bulk out on RAT production is to just add a couple and use them to replace your BEA with ALG (or MUS, if you have NS to set on fire). By letting your FRM's work on purely carbs/triglyceride and offloading all the protein to the HYF's, you can still significantly bulk up on output without completely overtaxing your logistics.


[11-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	ooh, I like that strategy a lot. Very useful stepping stone from FRM to HYF


[11-Aug-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	NS to set on fire, i like that. i tend to run MUS when water is low waiting on a ship.

**Alblaka**:	Ye. Boucher/Promitor is a great agricultural setup. If it wasn't half way across the universe.

**DogeConomy**:	Any of you guys interested in a Montem Planetary Bank (where you can deposit to or borrow money/take mortgages from)?


[14-Aug-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think that'd be pretty cool :p


[14-Aug-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don't even want to think how horrifically unprofitable that'd be. You'd need to offer interest to those making deposits to incentivize them to want to make deposits....and then you'd have to charge enough on the loan side to cover your interest to your depositors as well as the default rate on the debtors with no way to recoup losses.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sounds perfectly doable ;]


[14-Aug-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	default rate would be killer


[14-Aug-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	totally not default rate for sure


[14-Aug-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....eh. I just don't see anyone as a "legitimate" banking institution being able to offer interest rates anywhere near what someone could get by just spending their money.


[14-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there's many different types of people


[14-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So I don't see how the deposit side of the equation would take off. It's not like we need to bank our cash to protect it from robbers =P


[14-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Just thinking about handling all those contracts as well


[14-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no worries, I'm a spreadsheet master ;D


[14-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For example, what interest rate would you be offering for deposits?


[14-Aug-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	some people prefer to stack interest passively on term deposits rather than actively doing stuff (espc. if they're on a hiatus/holiday)


[14-Aug-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hopefully 5% p.a. *just throwing numbers around, my lending experiment has just begun*


[14-Aug-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll be targeting new-ish players with decent knowledge about the game


[14-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	5% "annually"? Ooof. That's what I mean. Most active returns are around 5% per day. And even 95% passive stuff like buying at the CX and having someone else ship have far better returns than that. And if that's your interest rate on the loan side....may god have mercy on your bank account.


[14-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and like real life mortgages, I'll be conducting thorough interviews with them


[14-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You'd lose your ass on even a 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 default rate.


[14-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I did say I was throwing numbers around


[14-Aug-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my default rate is currently at 0% (dealt with corp members in the past tens of times, and 3-5 other players outside of corp)


[14-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Count your blessings.


[14-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not so much that people will stiff you on the contract....as they'll just stop playing.


[14-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ok fine maybe I need to raise my pixel money interest rates


[14-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And with interest based loans, you're going to catch almost 100% loss unless they stay on until the end of term


[14-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well they paid for the game so.....


[14-Aug-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Tons of people pay for a month of a game and quit before they hit 3 months old.


[14-Aug-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	either they have tons of IRL cash to burn or they are not smart with their money


[14-Aug-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just pulling numbers out of my ass, but if you anticipate a 25% default rate from players getting bored, and a 3 month loan term, you'd need something like 125% annual simple interest rate just to break even.


[14-Aug-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	More if you want to turn a profit, and even more if you want to cover what you pay your depositors on their deposits.


[14-Aug-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	maybe I need to throw some futures contracts/collateral into the mix as well (requesting production outputs as an alternative to cash)


[14-Aug-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well I'll run it for a month and see how it goes


[14-Aug-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(without outside investment, unless it's a no-strings-attached cash infusion)


[14-Aug-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, have fun. Not saying you can't do it. Just don't plan on it being a profit generating venture. I offer loans myself...I just assume I'm going to take a loss, lol


[14-Aug-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hopefully I'll find the optimal interest rates xd


[14-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	thanks :D


[14-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nothing that will get you people who want to take loans. That's the thing. There are people offering loans at rates that virtually guarantee they're going to take a loss. They just have so much IDC/EDC money they don't care.


[14-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So the rates you have to offer to make it a profit generating venture puts you SO far out in left field, only the insane or desperate would take the loan.


[14-Aug-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	It's more like the convienience + trust the people have on Montem's local businesses :)


[14-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no-one actively advertises their lending services to the public besides me xd


[14-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	maybe i could use a loan in the future


[14-Aug-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	I would totally take a Doge Loan if I believed in interest


[14-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, taking a loan at even a relatively high interest rate can be a good play. A decent early investment plan should yield 4-5% per day. So taking a loan even where you're paying 2 or 3% on the principal every day is money ahead if you're not doing something colossally stupid.

[14-Aug-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I've been offered ship parts and loans, base upgrades and kitted out production centers. None of that felt half as good for me as it did to fill my initial base to max area after completely misjudging my production lines to begin with.


[14-Aug-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I could buy them off you


[14-Aug-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	are you selling them at moria. montem or do I have to pick it up at your EDC base?


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NeedzABetterSN**:	I could bring them to moria or montem, or if it's convenient they are situated at XG-751b


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NeedzABetterSN**:	I have 39 en route to moria now


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NeedzABetterSN**:	39 @14k, delivered here at montem tomorrow?


[14-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	come on man you know people sell for 13.1k on the CX


[14-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NeedzABetterSN**:	Lowest ask is 15k. 13.5k?


[14-Aug-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah probably that (Montem's bank accounts are running at deficit right now and you don't want me to raise taxes lol)


[14-Aug-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	13.5k should be okay


[14-Aug-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmmm competition :D


[14-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you'd better make a counteroffer now @NeedzABetterSN lol


[14-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, not so much competition as I already sell you upkeep materials, and I make EDC and IDC as a "priming the pump" on my electronics base


[14-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NeedzABetterSN**:	The upkeep of keeping up with contracts and adding another person to the equation.... I'd just as rather sell to the CX at my convenience for 13k, but I do have that shipment inbound so let me know


[14-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Don't worry, it's an experiment I was running last week to cull lower tier workers


[16-Aug-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've already queued up another Festivities III


[16-Aug-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	LR OT-580b (under programs)


[16-Aug-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Are you sure that will do the trick?


[16-Aug-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yes


[16-Aug-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's how @Rubicate managed to grow the scientist population


[16-Aug-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sorry if I'm being too critical... but this is affecting a lot of obligations I have to others


[16-Aug-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	hmm... it wasn't at full force even back then


[16-Aug-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've also reduced the damage of not running festitivies by queueing an advanced Education III this week (upping the amount of scientist growth by 30%)


[16-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	For future decisions like these, we'll have a referendum/vote, sorry for not notifying you


[16-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Vote? what choices would there be?


[16-Aug-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	voting for the experiments taking place or not, a simple yes/no question for the relevant players that employ the tiers in question


[16-Aug-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	The experiment was only a one week thing so scientist propulations should begin to regrow next week


[16-Aug-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	okay... but, why do we need experiments at all? Shouldn't it be possible to feed the POPI so that programs aren't needed?


[16-Aug-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it'd cost too much for the current tax rate


[16-Aug-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I'm running the planet on weekly deficits atm)


[16-Aug-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	expenses go out of pocket


[16-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	tax rate is already pretty high for SCI level.


[16-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah but there's only 300 scientists to tax from


[16-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plus scientist tier buildings make tons of cash from production


[16-Aug-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so we're effectively using lower tier taxes to fund higher tier POPI


[16-Aug-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I'm not so sure about the 'ton of cash' thing


[16-Aug-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well you sell in corp to the GTU so that's another factor


[16-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	over half is out of GTU


[16-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	but that's not the point


[16-Aug-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so how about a compromise- I set scientist taxes to zero and you manage POPI yourself


[16-Aug-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(the other scientists would also have to contribute because they'll lose out too if they don't contribute)


[16-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	How do other planets manage it?


[16-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	we can trial that for a week and if it doesn't work out we can switch back to the original plan which is not sustainable (as festivities III would cost more over time with growing population)


[16-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Are you even using the POPI spreadsheets?

[16-Aug-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	well. shoot. I guess I should thank SNF then. I didn't realize that. lol


[16-Aug-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Yeah this is the very problem I was trying to solve (apart from solving budget deficits) from day one


[16-Aug-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	How to maintain the higher workforce tiers in the most cost efficient way possible, with the current budget


[16-Aug-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plus festivities III is a band-aid fix


[16-Aug-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Yeah I've never run EDC and IDC. I have too much demand for other software. But I guess I see your point. Not convinced by your reasoning but I haven't looked at the detailed financials.


[16-Aug-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll share financials


[16-Aug-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	weekly


[16-Aug-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hold up exporting spreadsheets


[16-Aug-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	if you want... but my eyes glaze over on that stuff. lol I just assumed it was possible to tune the taxes to more-or-less pay for POPI.

[16-Aug-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I know I was surprised when i dug into POPI costs - small planet (7k) and only low Pioneers, we need 60xOFF and 50xDW (every 3 days) and 30xSUN, 100xTUB and 10xSTR (every 10 days)


[16-Aug-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah the costs increase exponentially for every tier you add onto a particular planet


[16-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	let me know if you need some help with the higher tier upkeep items. I can make most of that stuff.


[16-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	OFF.NC1 DW.NC1 SUN.NC1 TUB.NC1 STR.NC1 (paper napkin math


[16-Aug-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	18k per week for the OFF/DW alone


[16-Aug-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(using near cost prices for the OFF/DW)


[16-Aug-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, I sell him DW, but I don't have an H2O planet so have to buy the H2O on market - if you know someone who could provide that I would happily hand that off.


[16-Aug-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	previous three messages referring to @CraftsmanThirteen 's message about small planet POPI costs


[16-Aug-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(... and 30k/week for the rest)


[16-Aug-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I generaly don't look at CX prices for that stuff... but I suppose if you don't have asource you need to resort that


[16-Aug-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I don't, I used CX prices to remind me how much items should cost to manufacture, I know, my brain is weird working backwards like that)


[16-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(the "cost prices" come from CX imports though)


[16-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	since that's how I mostly run my business nowadays apart from montem


[16-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	e.g STR should cost ~1700-1800 NCC per unit to produce if buying AL from CX,  OFF = ~80 NCC/u, SUN ~350/u,  DW 30-50 depending on tax rates/making other consumables youself etc


[16-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	65 if buying water from cx


[16-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have plans to get an H2O planet to drive down my DW price, but it is stuck behind me getting more shipping, which will be another two months at earliest


[16-Aug-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	It's amuch smaller planet, so it doesn't really compare well, but for example on Berthier I make almost all of the POPI upkeep items, including the materials to make those items. Some weeks I'm short and buy from the CX though.


[16-Aug-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah for montem just refer to my financials


[16-Aug-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	but I can manage Berthier easily. I probably couldn't keep up.


[16-Aug-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	for *montem I couldn't keep up


[16-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	regarding festivities III being a bandaid fix, one week without it (which is worse than this week since I applied damage reduction through the education III program) and you'll lose a ton of scientists unless we invest a few hundred k a week (since technicians and engineers also consume a part of the scientist upkeep)


[16-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Xk37 yeah governing montem takes up 70% of my game time these days


[16-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	other 30% is dedicated to SSC.NC1


[16-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	ouch! well, sorry for the criticism then. I'll see if I can help somehow


[16-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I sometimes even let my other bases idle just cause I'm so busy


[16-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	We don't want that!


[16-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I am building out my Prism system (going from 1 base to 4) - I will let you know when I might be able to make other things.


[16-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If you changed the COGC to construction Pioneers would consume less of your time Doge =P


[16-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	do more research


[16-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Scientists are needy


[16-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's not how it works


[16-Aug-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I know Doge, but the way it works doesn't make for much of a joke


[16-Aug-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Carry on


[16-Aug-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	your second point makes a bit of sense lol


[16-Aug-23 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I am eternally over here memeing and having people think I am serious, it's not much but it's a living


[16-Aug-23 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	One Base Andy's have time for that sort of thing


[16-Aug-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	we should look into replacing these needy-assed prima donna scientists with PrunGPT or something. That'll teach 'em!


[16-Aug-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	^ this guy gets it


[16-Aug-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	LOL - I got your initial one, but had to feed my needy PP2 on Danakil - those things suck down AL


[16-Aug-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'm not up to the fabled PP2's yet


[16-Aug-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Still Bfabbing


[16-Aug-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@CraftsmanThirteen don't even talk about AL.NC1 I've been scarred from my 7x HWPs


[16-Aug-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	still have 400x LHP sitting around in the back


[16-Aug-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I almost got into AL production. Do tell.


[16-Aug-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That's a lot of hull


[16-Aug-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	7x HWP's  = 3500x AL burnrate a week


[16-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	roughly


[16-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Whoa


[16-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That would definitely have bought out my Deimos base I was considering


[16-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	make that amount per week, give them away and I'll donate half my production to you


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(on HWPs)


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	maybe 2/3


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the offer is open for when you want to build ships


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	:D


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Well maybe one day. I decided to stay closer to home and in my current production lines.


[16-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	But yes, later it will probably be a serious consideration.


[16-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well you could consider celebdil?


[16-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have a core module lying there


[16-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you have 100k I'll sell it to you now


[16-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That was one the the planets I looked at but I settled on Kiruna


[16-Aug-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	all good


[16-Aug-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I am working on getting my production lines pumping with efficiency help from the COGC's, specializing bases more


[16-Aug-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So since Vallis is overfull Kiruna looks like a great place to make Iron and Steel for now


[16-Aug-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	With a nice easy to settle Construction COGC next door


[16-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	libertas?


[16-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah


[16-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hehe I have my Welding factory there


[16-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	And then I can go back to making moon eyes at Vallis till she calls me back


[16-Aug-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Nice!


[16-Aug-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If you'd like to wait in line on vallis i'll let you know ASAP in exchange for 250 NCC per week


[16-Aug-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll discount it to 1 NCC xd


[16-Aug-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Once I secure Vallis I can get a spot on Danakil


[16-Aug-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Haha Doge


[16-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll let you know either way


[16-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Do you have a vote/Vallis watch bundle I can get in on?


[16-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just DM me reminders every so often


[16-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Copious yeah I do, the voting package is 250 NCC cheaper with the 1 NCC watch bundle


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Vallis is probably just going to tease me until my next HQ upgrade is years away and then open a spot


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so 751 NCC instead of 1000 NCC


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	👌


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Bank of montem is always open for loans :D


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	lol


[16-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	😁


[16-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Would you like me to bring a core module kit over to vallis for you, so you can claim your plot ASAP?


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	na I am good, thank you though


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh okay


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If it opens in a reasonable amount of time I am prepared


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I was able to pick up my Vallus spot when the wave of people from Steam who didn't like the game were removed.


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	these types of things are very unpredictable


[16-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	we will see if the +11 drops in a hurry or not


[16-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I picked up montem first, 105 days ago


[16-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I was "born" here - LOL


[16-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and vallis 30 days after, 66 days ago


[16-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If I'd wanted to Coliq I would have gone Vallis first Montem second


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I would've went promitor first


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	well yeah if I wanted to do the best start


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	make the already long queue even longer ;)


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but I want Construction start I just should have gone Vallis first for that


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	would have synergized better with what I am doing


[16-Aug-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and Montem is fairly easy to get spots on it seems in comparison


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Already got one of my Prom start corpmates over here


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it used to be the opposite


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(vallis was easier)


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Gotta shift over to work now gents, be back in 3 hours 20 minutes when my ships dock - have a good day!


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	were the COGC's different then?


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	later 13


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no, they've always been the same


[16-Aug-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	hmm, what was the reason for the shift you think?


[16-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just randomness I guess


[16-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the human condition


[16-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	fair enough


[16-Aug-23 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	if it drops at the rate it has been the timing will work out perfect for base 3


[16-Aug-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I watch all the starters like a hawk, I consider them prime real estate on account of the plot limit


[16-Aug-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	+ proximity to CX's


[16-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	except Promitor, I don't watch Promitor


[16-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	RIP


[16-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	RIP - restart in Promitor? ;)


[16-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	=)


[16-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It's what I tell all the people who don't like intentionally doing things the hard way to do


[16-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll hold your assets hostage for you until you come back :)


[16-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've done this in the past for other people


[16-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but me, I worked Construction so I AM Construction


[16-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	no going back now


[16-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yes sir o7


[16-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I leave it to my tech industry friends to be the farmers


[16-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	=P


[16-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	It'd be highly recommended to switch from PP1 to PP2 as soon as you have the cash to do it


[16-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	PP1 margins are very limited


[16-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yeah so I have been told, I'm guessing the PP2 game is Lfabs?


[16-Aug-23 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Bfabs and Lfabs


[16-Aug-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	the Bfab recipes looked worse on the PP2's in terms of ROI, did the recipe changes make the difference?


[16-Aug-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope ROI is based off CX prices


[16-Aug-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and you like to mine/refine your own metals anyway


[16-Aug-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so it'd be the same


[16-Aug-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or even higher as aluminium is ligher and you can fit more into your cargo holds


[16-Aug-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	interesting, I'll have to look into AL again


[16-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I've been looking at a lot of short hop Iron stops and on planet Iron COGC's


[16-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	construction COGC's that is


[16-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	PG is definitely something I want to get into over on Montem eventually, just hate to buy all the inputs so trying to back my way into it


[16-Aug-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	hence me producing my own Bfabs at Montem because I can cover most of the mats I need


[16-Aug-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nice :)


[16-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Lumachina** joined.*


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Ahh, I see the OnlyFans system has some AL just 5 jumps away


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That's a bit closer than Deimos


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	berthier?


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yee


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Malathas is closer but COGC electronics


[16-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I want an AL tap not another production line


[16-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I basically memorised most of the planets off by heart through my extensive research lol


[16-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	trying to keep it simple and grow rather than having a bunch of complicated production lines


[16-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yeah, I noticed the searches and advice all bring me back to the same set of planets


[16-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you just want a tap, I hope you have a WCB to haul the ore


[16-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you technically could have complicated, but simplified by buying most imputs from the CX


[16-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yeah, that's what my other corpmate does, but I like to produce my own stuff


[16-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@SCHAITR or hire three (or more) musketeers to ship goods for you


[16-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	my corp runs up from Prom all the time, I can probably get him to haul some for me if I ask real nice


[16-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just scrolling up to the conversation between @Xk37 and @DogeConomy This is why I strongly advocate for "never" putting ENG/SCI on starter planets. The problem with ENG/SCI upkeep is that "everything" eats it. It's not as if you can just provide culture and education and have it go to the ENG/SCI. The Pioneers and Settlers nibble on it too. So while the Scientists here only need 35 points of Culture, as an example, the Pioneers/Settlers will consume up around 14K points. So providing 350 points of culture would be MANY times more than the scientists need, but it would only generate 2-3% fulfillment...which means the scientists/engineers will still be right pissed the fuck off. So to make an economical planet for ENG/SCI, you need to basically make a bespoke planet focusing on higher tier workers with minimal amounts of the lower tier.

[16-Aug-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's also why running planetary festivities in the long run to make up for a POPI deficit sucks, because it boosts populations across the board, artificially spiking the amount of the ENG/SCI food that the lower tiers consume, making the problem ever worse.


[16-Aug-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	So how do you get rid of the scientists and engineers? Different COGC or is there a Chem building that everyone would use that employs another job type?


[16-Aug-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, look at Circe with the horde of Engineers. 5712 engineers.....45K pioneers. There is more than 1 engineer per 10 pioneers. Compared to here, where it's almost 100 pioneers per engineer. That's not sustainable.


[16-Aug-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Copius you can't


[16-Aug-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you "can", but the handful of people who stuffed them onto the starter planets are going to get their knickers in a knot if you do.


[16-Aug-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just shut down anything producing Culture/Education and severely limit comfort while stopping festivities. They'd fuck off in a couple weeks at most.


[16-Aug-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	They can go on strike metaphorically and physically (virtually) indefinitely


[16-Aug-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah even if not fed they would count towards the pop and consumption for the planet I imagine?


[16-Aug-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	so idle bases would still eat up resources?


[16-Aug-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	for the planet, that is


[16-Aug-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You don't need to get rid of ENG/SCI to reduce population upkeep. What they are taking is virtually nothing.


[16-Aug-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The problem is all the Pioneers/Settlers.


[16-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're happy off of life support and safety/health alone, but they still CONSUME the higher tier stuff, like culture and education


[16-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	well yes, you could go the other route but getting startes to jump into Eng/Sci is a tough road too I imagine


[16-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And the SCI/ENG "must have" that stuff to be happy.


[16-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	which is why you end up with all the Pioneers and Settlers on starter planets?


[16-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So in order to keep the higher tier happy, you have to be able to flood the planet with enough Culture/Education to fill EVERYTHING, which costs a fucking fortune


[16-Aug-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Unless a generous benefactor donates millions into Montem's coffers, that's not going to happen realistically (fulfilling everything)


[16-Aug-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is why ENG/SCI should "really" be on non-starter planets built out FOR ENG/SCI, because if they're built on top of mega sized piles of pioneers, they're unsustainably expensive without someone just paying for it out of pocket to the tune of many millions a week


[16-Aug-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically you want your entry level population for that kind of world to be TEC's, and keep your grubby Pio/Set's the hell off the planet, lol


[16-Aug-23 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	In summary, it's essentially a "catch-22". (not complaining or anything, which is why I'm leaving it here)


[16-Aug-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah nothing will ever be perfect, can't have it both ways


[16-Aug-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Still, interesting to hear the rationale for it


[16-Aug-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you can. You just have to pay out the nose for it.


[16-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	PIO/SET/TEC can all generate natural immigration, ENG/SCI can only be educated into. I'm of the opinion you want a 3 tier spread for any specific planet for maximum efficiency. Pio/Set/Tec, Set/Tec/Eng, or Tec/Eng/Sci. Sustaining 4 tiers is doable, but once you try to sustain from Pio to Sci....good night sweet prince. Hope you have a VERY fat pocketbook, or a population whose ready to pay out the nose for taxes.


[16-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because scientists are picky as all get out. If you had 100% life support, safety, health, and comfort....the SCI's would still be "nope"ing right off the planet.  So you absolutely must have decent fulfillment amounts on Culture/Education to keep them

[16-Aug-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Oh - that's a very interesting point @Zuul - I guess I didn't realize that PIO/SET will leach off the higher tier stuff. That explains a lot.


[16-Aug-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, it's not a lot compared to a SCI, but it's there....and there's so MANY of them. Like a SCI, each one, (from memory, so don't yell if I'm off) will eat 0.3 points of education. A PIO meanwhile will only eat 0.02. So 1 Scientist consumes 15 times more education than a pioneer. That being said, if education is COMPLETELY missing, a pioneer will only lose 2% happiness, while scientist tier will lose 30%. So anything not employing SCI (and to a lesser extent ENG) doesn't even need to worry about education, but as soon as you have those workers, you have to educate EVERYTHING.


[16-Aug-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is also why SCI taxes tend to be so high. You're not just paying for the scientists upkeep, you're paying for all the EXTRA upkeep that has to be tacked on to every lower tier worker to supply education to the scientists...and usually it's not even paying the bill at max tax rates.

[16-Aug-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	@Crash5291 the TLDR is: I was unhappy that we lost scientists... @DogeConomy is doing what he can but it's hard, and @Zuul pointed out that SCI on planet with a large PIO population is very expensive because of how the lower tiers can't stay in their damn lane.


[16-Aug-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	or something like that


[16-Aug-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's the short of it, lol


[16-Aug-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If anyone is departing from here to HRT or Prom with cargo space, let me know. I have some stuff I could ship if the stowage is available.


[16-Aug-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Now that i've read all that yup the TLDR is about right, but i was looking for the insight as i will likely be the next gov on Kinza and its got all 5 tiers on it.

**Copious**:	I keep looking at the construction market in comparison to what people say to do and it's interesting. I know it makes sense that more people would use lower tier stuff but the volume for Lfabs and Afabs are pretty similar on the Moria CX, where as the volumes for Bfabs are through the roof.


[16-Aug-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So I'm over here going, "Well it's lower profit but simpler to make and the demand is insane" but what I apparently want to do is move into Lfabs, which requires a lot of CX inputs or a longer supply chain


[16-Aug-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	ehh, I think I'm gonna end up doing the "dumb" thing and feeling good about it again


[16-Aug-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I like my little Bfab bases that only need a few basic inputs


[16-Aug-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	especially when there is 10million in volume for the Bfabs collectively but only around 1.5 million volume for L and Afabs

[16-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Copious - I think one thing is that for people starting the B-fab market is mostly on the CX, but corps do more self-production of L-fabs and R-fabs, thus you see less on the market - but you can make good money from them, but probably need to make your own EPO if you go the R-fab route.,


[16-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Wow - just compared population profiles between Montem and Circe, Montem has 3k Eng on 275k Pio (~1%) while on Circe there are 6k ENG versus 48k PIO (~15%) - way big difference - shows what the gov's problems are


[16-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Hiya gov!  good morning!  Time to go cook dinner here.


[16-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	totally, that's why I was trying to cull off low tiers by doing a Education III event


[16-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(we have too much overpopulation caused by continuous operation of festitivies III)


[16-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Even if we got rid of all the unemployed lower tiers, I think the underlying problem is still huge - and intractable.


[16-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	But I gotta go cook or I will have people on strike IRL - talk to y'all later


[16-Aug-23 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	Well, it looks like the ENG and SCI workforce is more or less back to where it was 3 weeks ago. What do we need to do to get SCI and ENG to migrate here? Will running migration programs help in the long tem or will the new workers just flee the following cycle?


[23-Aug-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Running migration programs would not help. as other workforce tiers would become unhappy and leave.


[23-Aug-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*immigration


[23-Aug-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	we're at a catch-22 at the moment


[23-Aug-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	ENG and SCI don’t migrate they increase by education.  So increasing education is the best approach.  Education will also make them happier


[23-Aug-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Significant additional investment is required in education in order to raise fulfillment up above 50%


[23-Aug-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	ENG employment will fill in two weeks assuming we don’t build any further building.  Our big problem is too larger a PIO and SET pop, this is what is causing low Safety


[23-Aug-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I was attempting to cull PIO/SET with the Education III programs but it seems like overpopulation is a huge issue built over time due to the constant Festivities III program being run


[23-Aug-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've been tying to build two more SPF for two weeks now... can't build them because there are no workers.


[23-Aug-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Tell me what we need for education - I will fill in what I can


[23-Aug-23 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	or whichever POPI needs attention, for that matter


[23-Aug-23 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You could try to run education II rather than III, that might bring PIO happiness below 70% so we don’t see migration


[23-Aug-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the problem is the people running SCI buildings would then be unhappy


[23-Aug-23 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	We need to talk with @Xk37 first


[23-Aug-23 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	As long as SCI happiness remains above the lower limit SCI won’t leave, might need to push culture up to balance


[23-Aug-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	did you mean festivities II? that also won't work because replacing fest III with festivities II would bring us down to 40%


[23-Aug-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Yes festivities my error


[23-Aug-23 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What's it cost you to run a scientist immigration program?


[23-Aug-23 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	@Xk37 I'm just going to lay this out for you. As it stands, this planet can't hold onto ENG/ECI without running PF3 (and even that may not be enough once hitting population targets because the open jobs happiness boost will be gone). So ANYTHING done, that isn't PF3, will result in significant bleed off of workers. Best case scenario for you, Doge can run targeted scientist immigration programs for the next 10 weeks (yes, 10 weeks) to get 120 new scientists give or take a couple (add 25 from program, LOSE 12-14 from happiness). During that time however, we will bleed of well over 1K engineers, maybe 1.5K+. Then PF3 could be re-engaged to secure the sciensts and allow the ENG to begin rebuilding. Long story short, best case scenario, 4 months for full employment.


[23-Aug-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The other option is for you to come in and personally build another level of broadcasting hub, library, and university and fund them (although I strongly suspect you'd need at least 2 levels of each).


[23-Aug-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Option 3 is give up on getting a meaningfully sized SCI population here.


[23-Aug-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's pretty much it.


[23-Aug-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly....I guess there is an option 4, which is to just keep running PF3....but keeping PF3 running for, again, 10 weeks to get to the number of SCI you want, is also going to keep adding thousands of new workers to the planet every week, which will drag down fulfillment across the board, so it will take longer than that.


[23-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	@BeBopLula Also, just a note, education fulfillment, and education the function that upgrades workers to the next tier are not associated in any way. Education the uptiering mechanism, is purely a function of happiness, although the presence of any of the POPI buildings that produces education "fulfillment" will also increase the rate of education the uptiering mechanism by their presence (funded or not).


[23-Aug-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, if it were up to me, anyone trying to add SCI/ENG would, for lack of a better word, go hang in the short term. Run edu 3 to reduce the upper tier bleed off (3 per week instead of 10+) for the next month and a half to 2 months. That would take care of the Pioneer/Settler overage, then pivot to targeted immigration programs for SCI and reinvest the savings into more education.


[23-Aug-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I hate to say it, because I wanted Montem to be my center of hi level production - but with the sheer scale of PIO employment alone - over 200k EMPLOYED - Eng/Sci is just too expensive with that ballast


[23-Aug-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Yeah, it's impossible to drain without spending massive amounts of cash or dialing the eng/sci populations down to zero for several weeks


[23-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Zuul I'm not sure it's worth running SCI immigration programs as it'd require more money to be spent on POPI, hence the catch-22 situation (either we burn cash/someone gets left out or the problem continues


[23-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Actually what I was getting at is the vast majority of people on this rock are running PIO/SET - because it is a starter planet, it is very hard to do SCI/ENG - maybe Circe is a better location if you need SCI/ENG - that is where I will be setting some of my stuff up.


[23-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Anyways 25x SCI for 125k NCC? I don't think it's worth it

[23-Aug-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I tried switching POPI inputs/infrastructure levels on the population calculator spreadsheet and it's going to cost a *ton* of money if we want to cull pios+settlers and keep scientists


[23-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Haven't found the perfect solution yet, if anyone has better ideas feel free to discuss


[23-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	@Dogeconomy :: I will probably get to malahat at some point as well, but for now my shipping limitations are stopping me from going to a new system


[23-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nice :)


[23-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I don't think there is a solution - the game just isn't designed for what we are trying to do - huge Pio/Set populations and large Eng/Sci - one or the other seems to work


[23-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah... I guess so


[23-Aug-23 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Having more SCI won't be a blip on POPI. SCI is NOT the POPI consumer here. They are barely a blip on this planets ass in terms of what they consume. Their cost is the fact that they require everything ELSE to be educated to get them the education they need. So there's precious little difference between having 100 SCI and 500 SCI if you're keeping them up.


[23-Aug-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	But the problem is getting the 100 SCI -> 500 SCI


[23-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure, that's the problem. That was in reference to "I'm not sure it's worth running SCI immigration programs as it'd require more money to be spent on POPI"


[23-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Oh, okay, I understand.


[23-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is categorically incorrect in any way that's meaningful. Adding "more" SCI won't affect the upkeep costs in any kind of meaningful way. Fractions of a % point.


[23-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I gotta move on to another planets production and do work IRL - hope you guys have a good morning. (yeah, the upkeep isn't the problem, its the creation of new - too bad we can't take some from Circe and drop them here)

**Zuul**:	NM, found it


[23-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and it is a spreadsheet after all so you can't adjust POPI inputs in the middle of a plan... I mean I could but then it'd take a while to update values and everything making stuff more fiddly on an already complicated spreadsheet


[23-Aug-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Gah, to hell with that noise. I could calculate what I need faster by hand


[23-Aug-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Zuul my earlier statement about spending more on POPI is due to the 15-20% satisfaction hole that'll need to be filled with the Festivities III turned off


[23-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Less, because you'd have bled off 50-70K population before then, which means higher fulfillment before you ever even "consider" adding more POPI


[23-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Festivities III is a bandaid fix, but it does save money compared to direct contribution


[23-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmm


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this is why montem's in a catch-22


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not a catch 22


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	bleeding population = someone gets upset


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Someone getting upset isn't a catch 22


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	spending more money = everyone gets upset


[23-Aug-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well


[23-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Welcome to why no one wants to actually be a politician that "does" anything. Sometimes the fix hurts for awhile. That's not a catch-22, that's just an "I don't want to deal with the whining and risk being voted out during the short term bitching while the problem is fixed".


[23-Aug-23 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So many governors fell back on the "We'll just run PF3 for eternity because it's cheaper fix", well....now the chickens have come home to roost and you can either pay out the eye to sustain that long term, or you can do what's necessary to get pop balances back into whack.


[23-Aug-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Fest III is not sustainable long term since more and more scientists will come and settle at Montem, which means the rate of pop growth on Scientists can't keep up w/ new buildings


[23-Aug-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	So I guess I'll have to do it the hard way


[23-Aug-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not sure what you even mean by that. SCI growth wouldn't continue long term anyhow. The second the jobs are filled there would be out migration.


[23-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Unemployment/open jobs are, technically speaking, your buffer against "modest" population imbalances because they tweak happiness on a per tier basis. The only reason it's not bleeding even now is because of open jobs.


[23-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Anyhow, if I can stop typing here for 10 minutes I'll go run proper numbers.


[23-Aug-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Doge, do you have a calculator for how much of each fulfillment resource a batch of buildings produces in raw numbers given a specific upkeep input? If not, I'll start crunching that by hand too


[23-Aug-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, based on my numbers, you actually have enough education POPI here to make this work...right now.


[23-Aug-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You're just not spending NEARLY enough on culture. Education is locked to the fulfillment of culture. You're pissing quite a lot of education spending straight down the drain as it stands now.


[23-Aug-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Consider the following. You do not want 100% fulfillment across the board if you're doing all needs. You basically want 50% across the board. 50% across the board results in 75/67.5/57.5/55/52.5 for happiness with no unemployment or open jobs. So no population outflows at all, and a constant inflow of pioneers to educate upwards. At 45% you have half the pioneer inflow, and a very minor outflow of scientists, small enough for education to overcome the outflow and continue growth.


[23-Aug-23 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So once the population numbers get rectified, you then want to target 45% for everything. You'll be able to dial back safety by a decent chunk, health by a TON, comfort will be roughly a wash....and then really just drop a couple art galleries and bobs your uncle.


[23-Aug-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	50% would give a larger safety margin, but anywhere between those two numbers will be happy times. You'll just be trimming or increasing your unemployment reserve by a couple % points.


[23-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You could probably even go so far as to fall back to 42 or 43%, and then fall back on a constant PF1 to maintain equilibrium.


[23-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And have PF2/3 available to deal with any exigent circumstances


[23-Aug-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Always nice to see some governor related advice


[23-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Agreed, on both points :]


[23-Aug-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It’s subjective to the planet. If you weren’t running higher worker tiers, and therefore not doing higher needs, targeting 45 or 50% fulfillment would be disastrous. If you were doing Safety/Health/Comfort and PIO-TEC, you’d be bleeding TECs all over the place.

**Zuul**:	Hence why I’ve never written anything up on the subject. There’d be so many caveats a readers head would explode.


[23-Aug-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll never understand the governor mechanics lmao


[23-Aug-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	I think the first step of Governor Mechanics, from my obviously inexperienced and new perspective, is be careful what you do on a starter planet


[23-Aug-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	that seems to be a lot of the issue from all the times I've seen this discussed


[23-Aug-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Starter planets are going to have large Pioneer and Settler populations, it's hard to get around that. I'm TRYING to get into the Chem game here and I'm still running settlers and pioneers while I do it.


[23-Aug-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Not to mention all the new players yoloing and just running construction or self sufficient operations (also me at some points)


[23-Aug-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Seems like in the end you'd be better off focusing lower tier Chem buildings here and using the nearby Circe or something similar for higher tier buildings, but again, I'm new and don't fully understand why you all do the things you do


[23-Aug-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	(my noobie guess is you are vertically integrating your base here and have both tiers of buildings going)


[23-Aug-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It’s not a problem that there are “lots” of pioneers and settlers. It’s that people decided that it was “cheaper” to run festivities programs to boost the happiness of the higher tiers instead of taking care of them properly. That results in a massive overpopulation of pioneers and settlers, which doesn’t “appear” to be a big deal UNTIL you add higher tier workers because the major expense isn’t added until then. Then you start paying education on all the extra dead weight workers.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	(Looking to buy 22 BSE onsite, going to post LM ad)


[23-Aug-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I think I got you Walrus


[23-Aug-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	let me check my stock


[23-Aug-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	fyi I'm flying Montem-MOR within 12hours if anyone needs shipping, I have 300t/m free


[23-Aug-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I do indeed have 22 of them


[23-Aug-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I can fill your LM or you can send me a contract, up to you


[23-Aug-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll send you a direct contract


[23-Aug-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	perfect


[23-Aug-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Holy cow that was the worst time I've had making a contract before


[23-Aug-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	what was it?


[23-Aug-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	did they change something?


[23-Aug-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Everytime I clicked the location box and started typing Montem, it went up a row and it started typing it after Basic Structural and replaced Elements with what I was typing


[23-Aug-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Mobile can be fun...either way thank you!


[23-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	lol, yeah, phone screens get ya


[23-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	no problem!


[23-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, there’s not a lot of vertical chem integration going on between multiple tiers Copious. For example, an AML has no links at all to lower tier chem facilities.


[23-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I hate trying to move the ship burn slider on mine


[23-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh I assumed it kept going Zuul, good to know.


[23-Aug-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Off the top of my head, I think the only chem dependency I can think of is FLX for einsteinium enrichment, but that’s not even a factor.


[23-Aug-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	The Chem Plants and Polymer Plants synergize so well and all the construction buildings seem to line up nicely, funny that it doesn't continue


[23-Aug-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, I mean, there’s plenty of links going up, just not chem to chem.


[23-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yeah, that's what I was imagining


[23-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Also hate to ask, but if anyone happens to have a few O on planet, putting an ad for that...definitely prepared myself for this expansion


[23-Aug-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I've messed around designing some Construction focused bases and it's always fun watching the items go in one PP and out another


[23-Aug-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I just assumed chem would be similar at the top


[23-Aug-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Won't be an issue for a while for me, I'm struggling enough affording the switch over to Chem Plants and Polymer Plants


[23-Aug-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	those are some hefty material bills


[23-Aug-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Just decided I wanted to take a bit of pressure of myself and make my own FE


[23-Aug-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	3 I can do, I've got a shipment coming in for my own smelters


[23-Aug-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and the Polymer Plants that are running now


[23-Aug-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	those things were expensive AF to put down


[23-Aug-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but they do produce some very profitable materials


[23-Aug-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	luckily one of my Corporation buddies has a little extra CL from his Montem operation


[23-Aug-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	If you think POL is expensive, don't look at an AML - LOL


[23-Aug-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I haven't even stuck my nose into an AML yet. Although I may soon.


[23-Aug-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Each POL is about 44k, LABs are 150k


[23-Aug-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	AML 1.2 million


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	POL expensive? it's just some LBH and Bparts...


[23-Aug-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	AParts is where we can start talking xD


[23-Aug-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I stuck a pin in the idea of an AML until I'm making my own damn Afabs. Which is in about....4 hours, lol


[23-Aug-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's just that not a lot of people do Aparts. i think the majority of people are still at Lparts.. including me. since metallurgy is 99% lparts :D


[23-Aug-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have *one* AML on Montem - its slow but I am getting what I need out of it.  I do make my own A-fabs, one PP-4 on Danakil (so not many)


[23-Aug-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Mostly I need the R-fabs now so I can make an MCA/ELP


[23-Aug-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	bump if anyone needs Montem->MOR shipping. I have 250t/m open and am leaving in a few hours.


[23-Aug-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I have a 2t package, going on LM now


[23-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ArcturusRex**:	That sounds like a plan


[30-Aug-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirBaki**:	i started as a constructor, which may not have been the best choice, but thats what i chose :p


[30-Aug-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	It's not a bad profession, and Montem is a good planet for it


[30-Aug-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	But if you decide to try out different professions, there's no shame in liquidating (COLIQ) and starting over


[30-Aug-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirBaki**:	I have to do the math well, but it seems like the basic goods dont actually make any profit if you have to buy the materials, and pay for fuel to transport it

**AmirBaki**:	I may do that after a few days, after I have learned a little, and use the stuff I've learned in a restart


[30-Aug-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Prices fluctuate often, but yes, extracting your own raw materials is better, if those raw materials are plentiful on your starter planet


[30-Aug-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirBaki**:	tomorrow I will be able to build an extractor, but I will probably need another habitat too and I already sent my ship back without getting the stuff for that so that was a mistake

**BeBopLula**:	@amir and all new starters, fuel conservation in the first few months is a key consideration if you want to be profitable.  Most people recommend pushing your fuel consumption to Min or at most one tick on the slider above min to increase your profit.

[31-Aug-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	My understanding is it involves accepting contracts on the local market and then not actually fulfilling the conditions, e.g. if it's a shipping contract they just take the cargo and keep it


[31-Aug-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	It is also possible to scam by posting sell/buy contracts, and not fulfilling your side.

**BlackAnthrax**:	but there's one thing about it: if you never breach the contract, the shipment stays blocked, eventully rendering his ships or warehouses useless. so he'd be forced to COLIQ or deliver eventually.


[31-Aug-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	governer gets all the taxes and decides where to spend them


[01-Sep-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Choice of Planet Project can have a big impact.  The major problem Montem currently have is its massive PIO and SET populations.  This makes it hard to keep Scientists and engineers happy and so they migrate off planet


[01-Sep-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	It is therefore very difficult to build higher industry on Montem


[01-Sep-23 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	I see


[01-Sep-23 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	I mean I don't really get it but I get the general shape of it


[01-Sep-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	but to be honest this is actually a very good design feature by the devs since it forces players to leave the core worlds


[01-Sep-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	So it's like an opportunity cost thing where you can only provide so much of all the needs combined?


[01-Sep-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	And if pioneers are slurping up all the basic ones you've got no resources left for the advanced ones scientists etc want?


[01-Sep-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	It’s quite complex, and this explanation may actually be wrong.  The population can be given five types of goods.  Safety, health, culture, comfort and education.


[01-Sep-23 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	safety goods are generally cheap, education expensive.  PIO like safety goods, SET like health, etc these goods increase the happiness of that worker class by a larger amount.


[01-Sep-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	If you have 100 total pop and give them 100 safety goods each worker is happier, PIO more happy than SCI.  If you give them 100 education goods, SCI get more happiness than PIO.  The happier a worker is the less likely they will leave the planet.  You want all workers to have at least 50% happiness so they won’t leave but if PIO/SET/TEC happiness goes above 70% the workers migrate to the planet and this population can grow significantly


[01-Sep-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Arin_Sylphia** left.*


[01-Sep-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	What makes workers unhappy is no jobs.  But all workers get a share of the goods given, so on Montem we have got a lot of unemployed PIO and SET who just use the goods so reducing the amount of education goods that end up with the scientist.  To increase the happiness of the scientists you could given more education goods but since these goods are expensive you can end up spending a lot of money keeping scientists happy.


[01-Sep-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	If we could reduce the population for PIO/SET our scientists would be happier because effective they would get more education goods.


[01-Sep-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I think that’s how it works


[01-Sep-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	pretty accurate


[01-Sep-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How can we help?


[02-Sep-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Trying to understand how I get pioneers


[02-Sep-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Just started


[02-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Once you build the habitats and have active production buildings, the Pioneers will come


[02-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You should also have started with 200 of them


[02-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The tutorial should also help you a bit in understanding the game


[02-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Just needed to shift the water and basic stuff ]


[02-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You should unload BOTH your ships


[02-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	But does the production take actual irl 18hrs?


[02-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yep it does


[02-Sep-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Yeah didnt see the 2nd ship


[02-Sep-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	rgr that


[02-Sep-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's all in real time, and although it seems a long time now, things pick up quickly once you have more bases


[02-Sep-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	well how much can i get out of 8 units of Iron


[02-Sep-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can check the prices at the nearest exchange (CX), which is MOR


[02-Sep-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	E.g. FE.NC1


[02-Sep-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Rgr


[02-Sep-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	Thats over 47k i suppose


[02-Sep-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you sell to the Ask price, you will get the case immediately but it's usually for a lower price


[02-Sep-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you have the time and can sell to the Bid price, you can get a higher price, but will have to wait for someone to buy at that price


[02-Sep-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	okay


[02-Sep-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	makes sense


[02-Sep-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	thanks bud


[02-Sep-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	what do i need to increase satisfaction?


[02-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's increased by fulfilling the essential needs and luxury needs for that population


[02-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can check what's needed at the workforce tab: BS -> base -> workforce


[02-Sep-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you fill all 3 of the essential goods, you'll get about 79.4% satisfaction. For luxuries, I suggest getting PWOs quickly as they're cheap for the boost they offer. COF is more expensive so that can come later if you don't have cash


[02-Sep-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you don't have the essential goods, satisfaction (and thus production) takes a big hit


[02-Sep-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	I can see that, thats why im tryna find how to get the PWOs atleast


[02-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ok I have to go now. I'm sure someone else will answer any question you have. Be sure to ask in the Help channel as this chat is just for this planet.


[02-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	PWOs can be bought at the CX (MOR)


[02-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chezzzy**:	rgr that, thank you for your time


[02-Sep-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ABadChoice**:	oh looking at it yeah it increases your output as well. I assumed it was like most things and just made the process faster, whcih wouldn't be that helpful for me since i would hit other bottlenecks straight away anway

[03-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Nothing, this is a slow game to start.  There is little that you can do to accelerate.  You will get new experts but the first of these will only appear after about 5 building days(the more buildings of a type that you have the quicker they appear)


[03-Sep-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Experts accelerate the speed of manufacture.  A HQ can accelerate some building types based on faction.  A corporate HQ will accelerate manufacture by 10% on the planet the Corp HQ  is built


[03-Sep-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but in general the recipes take multiple hours up to multiple days to finish. planning is basically the majority of the game. may it be base construction planning, logistics or market research.


[03-Sep-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	dont sit around and wait 6 hours.  set a timer, then go play something else

[04-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FlussDerivat505**:	how can I see the market value of the HCP I just produced?


[04-Sep-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nanny**:	@Fluss, open CXOB HCP.NC1 and check the bottom offer and top request (lowest red number and highest green). it's worth around that span


[04-Sep-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FlussDerivat505**:	Thank you nanny. I found it. Was not available to me without knowing the command


[04-Sep-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FlussDerivat505**:	Well. 20 units are not much but I have a tutorial contract there anyway


[04-Sep-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@FlussDerivat505 along the top of each buffer are a number of contextual commands (in gray) related to the current buffer. This should help make it easier to find commands.

**TheReal_StarMan**:	have 4 of those


[09-Sep-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah I wasn't ready for that high level of workers yet.


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I was honestly shocked at how productive Polymer Plants are


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	3 recipes in the building and 2 of them are super high ROI


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	yep


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	third one is shit ofc but who cares


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Mine is flipped but I do everything through Moria CX


[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheReal_StarMan**:	https://universallogistics.app/building/CHP i use this site


[09-Sep-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, at least until CL hit 3850


[09-Sep-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	its not 100 % accurate but its ok


[09-Sep-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I think at that point it slipped to slightly worse than PG


[09-Sep-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	yep


[09-Sep-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	but we can make our own cl so its not that bad


[09-Sep-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Sep-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yup, I am set up on Circe now, sending over the second ship load for all the Chem Plants.


[09-Sep-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	You have any idea what people do with all the excess sodium?


[09-Sep-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Other than ship it out and sell it of course


[09-Sep-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I was wondering if there was a decent recipe I'm missing that will burn a bunch of that up for me

**TheReal_StarMan**:	oh com on i just sold a shitton of lst for 100 this is bs


[10-Sep-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	the market scammers likely just bought and relisted at the higher amount


[10-Sep-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	how is that a 'scam'?


[10-Sep-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's called market making. if the listing price was too low, it might be you get bought out instantly and relisted


[10-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheReal_StarMan**:	abusing capital power to influence the prices


[10-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you are still relying on buying power. you cant buy up all h2o and relist it for 1k for example.


[10-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	no one woiuld buy it


[10-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sounds like arbitrage to me


[10-Sep-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	if you list too low, that's on you.


[10-Sep-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the only way you can list low and keep it low, is overproducing


[10-Sep-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I think we're all saying the same thing. I just don't see how it's a bad thing, necessarily.


[10-Sep-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and the price of the last 2 months never fell below 110. with an average of ~140.. you definetly listed too low


[10-Sep-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	there is a time component, somtimes. Maybe you need to take 80 now rather than 100 next week.

[12-Sep-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	But yeah - rival or not - breaking contracts is still a trust issue so yeah.


[12-Sep-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Agreed


[12-Sep-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Not a line I feel should be crossed, block people from contracts all day long for all I care, but if you accept it, you deliver it.


[12-Sep-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Then again, mast3rd3mon stopped filling COGC as soon as it was clear they'd lose, so bailing on obligations is BAU


[12-Sep-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I guess anyone that thought about putting RATs into it thought someone else would and inevitably was left unfilled


[21-Sep-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah I got used to it being done, one month I contributed for a faction contract and saw Doge offering to reimburse people, so I hadn't been doing any contributions.


[21-Sep-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Will watch more carefully this week, then next week I'm on vacation so you're on your own for a bit

**Tumaria_Steelsmith**:	Hello everyone. I'm a returning player with a new HQ on Montem (just 67 days). I feel more comfortable this time around so if Im staying I should contribute a bit. So I put 30 of everything into CoGC, I know its not much but I intend to do that every 10 days. Hopefully can do more as I grow, is this reasonable?


[22-Sep-23 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Oh you didn't have to do that, thanks :)


[22-Sep-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Sep-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Vile_Adventurer**:	what do you mean?


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	For my first days


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	if you mean that the beginning is a bit slow, yes it can be


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	reinvest all your earnings into more production :)


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	what are you making?


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Iron


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	And producing the FEO for it


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	On montem?


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	yep


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Is that bad


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	not really the most ideal planet for it really ;)


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Whats better?


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	Vallis has better FEO source, and a COCG that matches with it as well


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	well, Montem, its more of a planet geared towards chemistry


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	but, chemistry is a bit expensive to get into at the start


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	What can i produce on Montem at the start


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	Thats a hard question to answer, I started completely differently


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	but, looking at what the planet can produce, LST is pretty much always in demand


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	and would need litle to no processing further on


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	gather funds, build one or more chemical plants, import water and nitrogen, and start producing NS


[02-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	Nutrient Solution is a base product for a lot of higher tier agricultre


[02-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Can I scrap buildings?


[02-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	yes you could


[02-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	what do you have build now


[02-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	2x extractors and 2x smelters


[02-Oct-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	keep those for now, scrapping them is going to cut heavily in your profits


[02-Oct-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	are you familiar with prunplanner.org?


[02-Oct-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Kind of... not sure how it helps me plan for the future


[02-Oct-23 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	so, lemme have a quick look at it for a new montem player one second


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Wow thanks!


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	so, your planet now looks probably somehwat like this: https://prunplanner.org/shared/ef975968-7fdc-4315-8fa3-1989daf8af40


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	o boi

**TwistedEyes**:	Does anyone wish they had more HER? :D


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	look at the daily profit, and change the recipee to the one without FLX


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	you`ll want to use FLX whenever you can


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	Where does it say profit?


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	second column from the right, in the overview screen


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	It just says import export


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	with the current CX avarage prices at moria, you are looking at 1500/day


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	Ah wait, you might not be able to see that without my empire settings


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	yea ill make my own


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	But should i shift to chemistry?


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	you could keep this for now, but slowly try to use the Montem COCG more


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	you know what a cocg is?


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	what you could at least do for now, is chaning your EXT around a bit, extrating 3 Iron ore for 1 LST


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	this will increase your profit already, and also start using FLX


[02-Oct-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	after which you can look at adding a CHP, and turn that LST into FLX, so you produce your own, and you could sell the excess


[02-Oct-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokerboffin**:	So flux produced iron? but iron does not link to any chem bonus so should i redirect irt


[02-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	yes, use the flux recipe as much as you can its much more efficient


[02-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	not right now, if you start cutting down those buildings, you are looking a quite a bit of loss in your early game


[02-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	just try to refactor it a bit from now on :)

[02-Oct-23 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Myrtenaster**:	set up a CONTD and look through the different templates, it has a short explanation about each one


[03-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	basically changes how much you repay each time


[03-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	You can see how it would look after selecting each one


[03-Oct-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	interest loan: only pays interest, then pays back all principal in one lump sum at the end. stable loan: pays an equal amount of principal every period. annuity loan: each period has the same payment (principal + interest)

[12-Oct-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I know there's a decent amount of people that have HYFs (hydroponics farms) that have their own WELs to make MHL rather than buy it from the CX as it's a lot cheaper in the long run


[12-Oct-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	tbf the MHL.NC1 has gone up a bit in the last few weeks but I tore down my WEL on Montem and replaced it with a POL because MHL was only like 1k profit per day and TRU is now trading at a loss

[14-Oct-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	My understanding is that the infrastructure was upgraded a lot and people thought it'd be better put to use as chemistry


[14-Oct-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Still a bit of back and forth voting, but it's been chemistry for a while, I personally only use chemistry here to make NS, but some others make EPO or DDT


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	ah okay


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	About how long ago did you stop playing?


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	over a year ago


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	ive got a self sustained Bfab place here


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Ahh nice


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	buy FLX, C and consumables and let it go


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	idk if i should move it elsewhere?


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I mostly make bfabs, FLX, and NS


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You could work towards having a base on Danakil


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	im planing to expand to Celebdil to make AL


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Same here, eventually :]


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	bring it back probably to Iiron to make Lfabs


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	so i might move my PP1s there


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	to Iiron


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm thinking something like Celebdil for AL, Danakil for PP2s


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	havent heard of danakil ill check it out


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	do you know the PLI?


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	(OT-442b)


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	nvm got it


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	oh next door


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm guessing that's where construction efforts got moved after Montem became chemistry


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeed :]


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	no i like Iiron bc it has helium so i can do welders too


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	and its right here


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It's nice being right in the system


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	montem is a lucrative spot now


[14-Oct-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	cant move here anymore


[14-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Keep in mind irion requires tsh


[14-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I was just quick enough to get to Montem, not in time for Vallis sadly


[14-Oct-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	wish Id made a spot on vallis bach in the day lol


[14-Oct-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That'd have been very nice :]


[14-Oct-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Ahh yeah Iiron requires both HSE and TSH


[14-Oct-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	The hse isn't so bad. The tsh hurts


[14-Oct-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Still an added 30-40k per building total


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	one time cost right?


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Costs that for building and repairing the buildings


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	but when its 1 TSH per building how often is that?


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	significant?


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	ive never left montem


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Usually when you have the expensive parts like HSE or TSH I've seen people recommend repairs every 89d, unsure what's optimal though


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	ill google around, not commited to anything yet, AL mine is first


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Gotcha! If you're in the Discord people definitely know a lot in there


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DataCollector420**:	oh yeah discord is a good idea


[14-Oct-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	Yeah a long time ago I was the tier 1 prefabs guy for a corp and well - mcg was a part of that. Then it turned to be more profitable than PP1 stuff - and so it expanded.


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But it doesn't make a whole lot of sense anymore for me - just can't be bothered to rework montem.


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Can't blame ya, I have a lot of things to get around to changing/upgrading


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Have a lot of things that aren't as profitable as they can be due to laziness :]


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yup, I'm refusing to expand beyond the 4 base count because too much effort.


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I dunno how folks run 10 bases


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Trying to even wrap my head around how to structure bases for ship parts or electronics is wacky


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	A lot of vertical stacking in the beginning I assume


[16-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@ArcturusRex that's a good approach, until you get to things like "Okay let me try and make some plans that could build a ship from scratch"


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	LOL


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	just add more plans :D


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though I don't think I'll be insane enough to do that anytime soon...looked at what it would take to make a WCB ship..I'm happy to be a humble farmer


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Maybe just figure out one part, like the WCB itself


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Definitely a lot more doable alone :}


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	@MysteriousWalrus Can't wait for death and taxes! Well...mostly taxes


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeed! A WCB could mostly be made on a metallurgy planet


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I almost switched a lot of my space to WCB I just need more room to carry stuffs


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Switched both of my starter ships to WCBs, worked out very well


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Nice I have one at WCB, still saving up for the second


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	2k/2k is tempting for my second though


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If I rememeber correctly, the only reason I didn't do that was because I'd have to upgrade the crew quarters as well


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	looking at recipes for SKF and I now understand why Vallis exists :D


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Sad its still full though


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	LCB does require a bigger crew quarters and that adds quite a bit to the upgrade costs


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	WCB is the most economical upgrade for starter ships imo


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Is that the CQT or CQS?


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Needs*


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	depending on what you're hauling, MCB can also make sense for starter ship upgrade


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	323/435 available heading to the cx


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea true, I think a WCB for both starts is best cause of the metals and mineral weights


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	WCBs give the most value for money imo. Adding ~200k to the upgrade costs over MCBs for a much better flexibility in what you can haul


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I always forget its 6x the weight in tons


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	So good


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	E.g. hauling 10k RATs from HRT here to sell


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Going from being able to carry 183 LST to 1000 is also neat


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea I actually have a WCB that runs from bastion filled every trip I love it


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Vasyklo**:	Ive been adding upkeep for pop inf


[16-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@--SCHAITR-- agreed, I went for WCB on both starter ships even though I might not need the extra weight capacity, since I got a great deal on the WCB. If you know that you will only be hauling water and ag products for example, then maybe paying less for MCB is worth it. But flexibility is worth a LOT

[21-Oct-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	You use to be able to accept local market ads but not direct contracts. Unless it's changed, I haven't done it in a long time


[21-Oct-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Don't think free people can interact with the LM or Contd at all unless they've been PRO once, i.e. fall back to BASIC

[21-Oct-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It spams up the LM for people that want to use it legitimately, so I imagine if they continue and don't start accepting the deals they will end up the same way.

**Copious**:	Yeah most folks are aware, we're keeping an eye on it.


[21-Oct-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	There is precedent for dealing with joke LM ads so if they fill the whole page and don't start accepting the ads then there will probably be consequences.


[21-Oct-23 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	(someone tested them by accepting one of them and the posting party terminated the contract)


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	the guess is that it's intra corp trading but I'm not sure why they wouldn't be using private ads if that were the case


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	or private conts rather


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We should just accept everything :)


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	apparently they'll just terminate, but I'm not testing it on that scale


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If we spread it out among us, the impact will be lower


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Cataclism said he accepted one and the guy terminated, I scrolled up to see who it was who had done it


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In any case, Crash posted it in Discord so we shall see what Molp does


[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DarkKing**:	Doge, are you running for reelection?


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Fingers crossed that's a yes


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'd be willing to do the administrative work but do not have near the funds required to run Montem the way Doge does, nor the experience to do it well. I'd be a puppet governor dependent on taxes and advice.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	But I'll do it if you put a gun to my head and Doge is burnt out


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I've been learning POPR and POPI with some help on Discord


[26-Oct-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I was slowly doing the same but honestly hoping to start MUCH smaller


[26-Oct-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Montem seems like a hell of a first planet to govern


[26-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	for a capped planet, we don't need extra workers unemployeed to suck up resources.  Likely a way to lower costs and still be good


[26-Oct-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I'm working towards getting my daily spend on Danakil from $150k to $50k for POPI


[26-Oct-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	ohhh that's a lot of spending


[26-Oct-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but Danakil is pretty popular I guess


[26-Oct-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Momtem is much bigger


[26-Oct-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	yeah, starter planet and all that


[26-Oct-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I'd be interested to see if Montem ever commits to just keeping the lower tier workers happy and not trying to hard to keep the higher tier workers around, fighting against the massive influx of lower tiers at all times.


[26-Oct-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Dana has workforce pop of 164k, while Montem is almost 3x at 435k


[26-Oct-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Not sure how much that'd help you on cost


[26-Oct-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh good then when I start things up on the little planet I am eyeballing for CL it won't be too bad till a bunch of people show up


[26-Oct-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and when they do......taxes


[26-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	you just have to at some point I imagine


[26-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	How much of your Danakil expenses do you end up funding through taxation?


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	I collected 474k for last week, around 67k/day.  And my expenses are 110k-120k


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	So half or so, not great but at least it takes the edge off I guess


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	But the old Gov gave me a big pile of NCC to cover the shortfall, so it is not out of pocket for 3+ months


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Oh that's nice


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Have you considered raising it to parity? Does anyone do that or does it just make it too expensive for people to produce?


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Once you run out of the funds of course


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	taxes are like 1% of revenue, most people would not notice if taxes were raised 50%


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	but I've pleged to not raise taxes until the extra funds run out


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah, good man. Thanks for the numbers, it helps me conceptualize what running the planets looks like


[26-Oct-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	let me work on a google sheet, are you good with that?

**Anxuiz**:	Hi all, in Doge's absence I'm putting in a bid for Montem governor. My company specializes in the chemicals industry and has invested a full 1000 area base at Montem. I'm running on a platform of cost effective population upkeep to support pioneer, settler, and technician chemistry production. If elected I have several million in liquidity to help provide a smooth transition.


[28-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	Please reach out with any questions. I hope to earn your vote.


[28-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Just Fair warning Motem is likely VERY VERY expensive to keep filled, i'd guess in the realm of 300k plus a week. and likely only have taxes cover a fraction of that.

[28-Oct-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	your in the millions it looks like


[28-Oct-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	IMO it's reasonable for taxes to be raised to cover the shortfall.


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If I recall correctly, I rememeber Doge sending a screenshot of the tax dividend for Montem, which was somewhere a bit over 1m I think.


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'll vote for anyone who promises to max taxes because it's funny.


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	lmao


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm not even joking. Mast3rdemon or whatever his name was spiked taxes hard and the tears were  delicious, but I don't think anyone actually lost money....then he didn't fill the COGC and it became less funny....


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	No I agree with you. Any planetary drama is funny to me :p


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I have no issues with a gov raising taxes over and over until they attain a desirable state of profitability  and actually end with some money for the hassle.


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So yes - Montem IS expensive  to maintain - but it should have the  ability to be taxed into profitability.


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Dodge kinda  screwed  himself by saying he'd revert to  Rubicate's tax rate  - and Rubi ran at a huge loss cause he didn't care


[28-Oct-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	iirc he was sitting at like 360m+ with nothing to do with it so he just didn't care


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Especially if no well established players are willing to take up governorship, just a better case for raising taxes :]


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Maaan I hope I can get to that point :p


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Rubi's cash cow was COF and BSE's - and he actually made more money from BSE IIRC


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Rubi  also setup quite a few deals for suppliers and I would recommend the same. I filled MCG upkeep on montem for him at 22/mcg because zero effort for me. STR and SUN were more of a hassle though


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Really I'd say a governor maybe well suited by owning a bunch of personal BMPs on Circa just making a large fraction of what they need for upkeep to reduce costs


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I make all my inputs except MCG


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Makes the supply a lot more stable once you figured out the logistics


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The part that scares me is the pop infrastructure and figuring out what you need  to build  or not build.


[28-Oct-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	as for POPI inputs/tax concerns, the stockpiles I've built on POPI reserves have balanced the books out so don't be afraid that Montem would intitially lose you money, especially.given that theres weeks worth of runway on the major POPI buildings

[29-Oct-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Endercrest**:	I've boosted all I can boost, still going to take so long to get my next buildings


[31-Oct-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Qi.Ht**:	It's a slow game starting out but that gives you time to plan for future expansions, plus freight pays while your boats are doing just a little for your own goods.


[31-Oct-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	yup, I made more from freight than in manufacturing in my first month or so


[31-Oct-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	also, specialize! For example, moria has 25% bonus to chemistry, and 5 experts adds 28+% more bonus(to production speed). If I were to start again, I would ask for a loan from global chat and build 4 Polymer Plants to make PG. Assuming you buy everything from Moria, thoso 4 plants will make 19k a day in profit(not counting workforce costs, it should be less than 1k a day) at 100%


[31-Oct-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	easy 500K a month.


[31-Oct-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-23 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Qi.Ht**:	Right I may go poly after i get my extractor set up, literally just getting started again, Settled Gibson then Farmed Prom. Felt lucky to find a spot of ground here, remnants of some old buildings from a previous owner, nothing of value though the company cleared through things pretty good.


[31-Oct-23 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Making CL in a CHP is good too


[31-Oct-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	yeah, but not as good. making 1 at 100% takes 14 hours, and 1 chp needs 60 settlers. cant match PG. not to mention, HAL prices are through the roof.


[31-Oct-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	sure, not 600+ as it used to be, but 275x3 for for 3.4KX1 every 14hours isnt as good

[01-Nov-23 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	That is a good question - we have too many Pioneers on this planet as it is.


[01-Nov-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	People are voting for the education event, it doesn't bring in new pioneers it boosts all pio production output by 10%. I get it, but I'm more interested in boosting chem output :)


[01-Nov-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	im only doing PIO cause i got a base with 2700 Pioneers on it lol


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yup. People who do not use Montem for chem vote for what they use it for. Ideally it'd be manufacturing for me, but I'm very much in the minority, so the folks using montem for constuction, lst extraction and manufacturing vote pioneer as that's what would help them


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	PIO wins very very rarely - basically only if the chem nerds fall asleep


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Chem nerds never sleep, that's what the Chems are for.


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Just ask Firefreak, he'll tell you


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah last time it won, a few PIO folks myself included agreed to vote at the very last minute


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Copious**:	love it


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So we overtook chem like an hour before it went into effect - since them chem crew votes consistently and we cannot match their vote count


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Smart, I like the move


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I bet you Chem boys came out in force the vote after that


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I used to argue for a Construction COGC here but I stopped fighting it and installed POL's


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	PIO win is overall not great as the bonus is much smaller than a specific industry so I get why some people are very upset about it


[01-Nov-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Owervorked**:	just switched montem base to chem exclusive, if it changes, I revolt. Ill make my own montem with Blackjack and whatnot


[01-Nov-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Montem isn't flipping - it's just not. Not without a massive influx of new players who buy pro


[01-Nov-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Three major PIO players on montem have quit since we were able to flip it so it's not happening with the current numbers

[02-Nov-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	to get PIO to win, basically every pro player who isnt chem needs to build buildings with super high PIO density (e.g. BMPs, PP1s)...


[02-Nov-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and if people who are construction get PP2s, they also want their PP2s to work more effectively. so PIO cogc is a waste.


[02-Nov-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	pop based COGCs arent worth it.


[02-Nov-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	BSE and BBH are super stable, high profits. Especially when Iron is so cheap


[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'd argue that the 'normal' price for Iron has been new player subsidized for sometime. It's awful margins. Only reason it was ever cheap is people who got trapped into it as noobs


[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	A new player choosing FE production start gets shafted vs a noob making RAT


[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's one of the many poor design choices in the game unfortunately


[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I've suggested before that FE shouldn't need C and STL should add the C component but welp


[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's made worse with FE being an nightmare to ship vs AL


[03-Nov-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	The shipping issue with FE is a much bigger issue with FE prices than many realize - notice how many TINY sell orders push the price of FE down.


[03-Nov-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Cause what happens is a noob delivers his max capacity of 63 FE to the market - and now they list it at the 1 credit lower price. Next noob shows up and undercuts thats by 1 and so it goes


[03-Nov-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So now you have 30 listings from 550 down to 460 but the volume is TINY


[03-Nov-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's a stupid problem but easily...'fixed'

**Endercrest**:	cheers for the info, and for buying iron


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Endercrest**:	The historical 180d price of iron is healthy, it just seems to have weird dips


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Endercrest**:	but it is rough a noob start choice. espeically when you don't have much info when creating your account of where price points, supply, demand, etc are at


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Yea, smelting isn't something a new person should get into. Montem start I generally suggest just going full LST. The price isn't too bad and there is always constant demand for it.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Granted, it isn't "ideal" but the supply chain needed to make it work is a pain unless you work with someone.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	*smelting


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Going LST route at the very least gives you time to figure out what you want to work towards

**Loggan_Stormfang**:	hi


[04-Nov-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	i'm new here, (less than 20 days)some advise to a newbe?


[04-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	What industry are you specializing in?


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	mining


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Extracting LST is a pretty stable if boring way to go, but it gives you a constant income stream that you can use for expansion later on


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can then consider taking advantage of the planet's Chemistry production bonus by building POLs and making PG for example


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	yes... i have seen that... the FE price is near the price of C so the real income comes withe the STL


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Did you mean metallurgy?


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	yea, both


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Btw, for future reference, you should use the recipe with FLX when smelting


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It makes much better profit


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	i don't know if there's a change, but sudenly i feel  that i spend much more fuel


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	click the selector in the fuel slider a few times and see whether it changes


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	the planets also move around and we could be in a less advantageous position orbit-wise


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	I noticed the slider sometimes jumps around, even if UI doesnt show it. If you select the amount and then click on the ball sometimes it jumps to higher


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	i know... but the first week i made a lot of travels withe teh full fuel capacity, now i need to recharge every travel


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Are you carrying a lot more stuff? That affects fuel consumption


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	not realy...


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And you should try to travel as slowly as you can bear to because fuel isn't cheap


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Well, to a point. It's logarithmic both ways


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Min speed is super slow, and max speed is super expensive


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	Well few das ago it was like 25% of STL to reach station in 2-3hours from Montem, now closer to 50%


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Just a bit over minimum fuel consumption gives you quite a bit more speed


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	It is in furthest orbit, yeah


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But max fuel gives you not that much less travel time than half fuel etc


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	While highly unlikely, you can also check whether your ship needs repairs. Speed is affected if it falls below 80% condition, so you might take more fuel if you travel in the same time


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	i don't mind to send 1.5 days travel


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Ehhh - go pro and run shipping contracts


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I target ~12h for in system flights so I can run my ships 2 times a day in system and target 24h for jumps


[04-Nov-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It makes it easier to manage the fleet if all your ships are there waiting for orders say at 9am and 9pm daily

[04-Nov-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	constructing a second extractor, reduces the time needed for the orders or increase the material outcome?


[04-Nov-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	latter


[04-Nov-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	latter?


[04-Nov-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Last one. Increases the outputs. So now making 2 at however long it took before


[04-Nov-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	ummm... ok


[04-Nov-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	thanks you very much


[04-Nov-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	I mean I'm high if I'm explaining it weird. It takes me 11 hours to make 11 lst. With 1 so with 2 it takes 11 hours to make 22


[04-Nov-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Chiming in late to the starting strategy. I began with mining LST to get a feel of the game. Then I got into making NS which was very good income


[04-Nov-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I hit most of the bases to learn how the game operated before getting into more complicated logistics


[04-Nov-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	But focusing on expanding the LST and NS setup helped my company grow quick

**AtomicScience**:	Well, Montem is a chemistry planet for many, myself included


[04-Nov-23 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Don't assume people make stuff for the CX. Most of the stuff I make is consumed by myself or by corp-mates via private contracts.


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	You can't really oversupply Chemistry, to be honest.


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	As some of these prices dip people will do things like spin up more production on the Construction side.


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	And it doesn't take a lot of full Construction COGC's to burn through all the chems we can make.


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yeah the CX is a fraction of the actual volume of product - and I have mixed feelings about it - only because you need pro to engage in the under the table deals


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Plus it kinda makes higher tier products seem 'dead' while really they are actively produced and trader, just off market


[04-Nov-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I kinda loathed making multiple contracts daily so I gave up on that life and just do CX and LM - with a tiny bit of contractual dealing - but every time I do contracts I save a ton of cash - just meh - such a hassle

[06-Nov-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Nice! Yea at first I was flirting with warehouse fees. It can be very logistical even in the beginning if you want to expand fast


[06-Nov-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	mining LST and then making NS.NC1 is what kicked me off very well


[06-Nov-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Not bad thats a very stable fab. If you have any left over room here I suggest looking at chp or pol to utilize the chem bonus


[06-Nov-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	Production of Flux is certainly an idea, probably going to get oxygen up first though.


[06-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	Even if flux is very cheap.


[06-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	I just don't have settlers yet


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Collecting O here isnt bad either considering the charts on it to sell the extras


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	but eventually you should invest in settlers once you have a good grasp and income is flowing


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	Yeah that's the plan


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	But honestly NS better than flux if you are using CHP to make money. H2O and N are cheap enough


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Then you can take your whole bfab operation to a construction planet :)


[06-Nov-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	I would use Flux for Iron Production, most likely.


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	I'm unfamiliar, what is a construction planet?


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	So if you look at this planets info and scroll down youll see Chamber of Global Commerce


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Montem being a chemistry planet - 25% boost to chemistry :]


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	Interesting.


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	PLI OT-442b (Danakil) is a construction planet for example


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corono_of_Ntikirra**:	Liron is one too.


[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Nov-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Nov-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	LST + proximity


[07-Nov-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	^^^ this

**Mordgier**:	Meh, BMPs burn WAY more LST making MCG than chem.


[07-Nov-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	POL making PG and EPOs is what I'd do if I were going chem here


[07-Nov-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	definitely, just saying that's the reason why Montem was chosen


[07-Nov-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	for the cogc that is


[07-Nov-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's CX proximity really, LST isn't a major factor at all


[07-Nov-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Going manufacturing or construction would burn far more LST than chem


[07-Nov-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	iirc back then SNF got almost all its NS from montem chem production


[07-Nov-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and some other corp I forgot about


[07-Nov-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	but yeah, they mostly pushed the cogc I think


[07-Nov-23 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Montem chem production is a money printer - that's all there is to it


[07-Nov-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ven1**:	Who are the consumers of chems here to keep it at money printing status? Other CX's have similar prices


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	There was a breakdown of the demographics of Mor and such, I could be remembering wrong but Mor has like 75% of all players?


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	Damn


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Ugh, the Dev team puts out the numbers. I'll have to find them again


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	I take it it's mainly bigger companies outside of Mor then


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	dont care who the consumers are as long as theyre buying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	At least those that are financially secure. A ton of planets require INS and other building requirements that drive costs up.

**Copious**:	The chems are heavily used in a few things that are essentially infinite money sinks, hence the prices.


[08-Nov-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	AFabs, Nab, some of the luxury consumables.


[08-Nov-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	PG is more ships I believe, but same idea. Essentially infinite demand.


[08-Nov-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Unless we were to all suddenly be rookies again that is, but the churn of veteran players keeps the high end production pretty consistent.


[08-Nov-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	RAT's are similar, which is why Prom is also such a consistent and popular start.


[08-Nov-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Everyone needs RAT's. It's unlikely you'll ever see them bottom out.

[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	production building + habitation = workers


[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	You can get it by building more habitats for the type of worker you need


[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	And yeah you'd need to have jobs available for them


[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	Where would I find loans and such?


[14-Nov-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	as far as I can tell, personal contracts with another player. Going to need basic/pro for that to happen.


[14-Nov-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	Alright, I take it its more of a in-house corpo thing. Didn't see any public listings for loans anywhere


[14-Nov-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Basically as the Local market is only meant for goods. There are a few established players that don't mind giving out loans.


[14-Nov-23 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ven1**:	Well It also lists services, like shipping

**Atova**:	Just curious, once you have a couple of buildings producing is it best to make more of them buildings to increase output? I have a Prefab Plant and Polymer plant and we considering making more of them? Or is it best to diversify?


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@Atova it's really based on your preference. However, Montem has a "Chamber of Global Commerce" program which gives a +25% efficiency bonus to all chemistry production.


[17-Nov-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Polymer Plant benefits from that bonus, but Prefab Plant does not.

**Anxuiz**:	Montem government update: Tax revenue has been robust to support upkeep for all population tiers. Dialing in a new popi strategy targeting 10% unemployment for all but scientists. Assuming that works out, there should be a modest tax reduction for Pio/Set/Tech industries in the next term. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.

[30-Nov-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	sounds like youre out of SF, then


[30-Nov-23 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Either that or the browser needs to be refreshed


[30-Nov-23 04:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	I have tried updating the page and entering other closer coordinates, in all cases I am left "calculating"


[30-Nov-23 04:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	and it have 119 of SF


[30-Nov-23 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and where are you trying to go?


[30-Nov-23 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	from OT-889g to Moria Station


[30-Nov-23 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	That's rough, it probably isn't enough fuel to get back to moria


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You're on FREE license and it's going to be hard for us to help you.


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	yup, not enough STL fuel, as said above :)


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	bring fuel with your other ship


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	you can move stuff between ships as long as they're on the same planet


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	for the future: 50% one way isn't necessarily also 50% the other way


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	take-off and landing are different, planets move over time, stuff like that


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	but in the travel from Moria to OT-889g supousedly i spent less than the 50% of the SF, why now it spent more than the first travel?


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	because take-off and landing are different and planets move over time


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Loggan_Stormfang**:	and even if i try a shorter travel, it still stays in "calculating"


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	because you dont have enough fuel to do the trip even on the lowest setting


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daegon616**:	if you use 50% of 1500 SF then you will have 750 SF left for the return which would be 100% of the fuel. as the planets orbit in this game then your return journey could be more or less than the 750 fuel remaining


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daegon616**:	hope that helps


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	moral of the story: never skimp on fuel in your tanks


[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	there is also no shame in using the COLIQ command to restart, once you have determined your best course of action


[03-Dec-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	also, watch your fuel consumption, that can get expensive. And be wary of the NPC faction contracts, "planetary survey" can bankrupt you quickly


[03-Dec-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for new(er) players who would like to upgrade to WCBs. I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE; 470k) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL; 650k). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. DM me if you are interested :)


[20-Dec-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	im over 180 days old but comparably to other pre-180-bescents, im still with one base and good ol two ships xd


[20-Dec-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bill090**:	hey just checking is 180 days in reference to the account or the company?


[20-Dec-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm not going to speak for Schaitr, but I'd assume company rather than account. Though you'd still need Pro to make the transaction.


[20-Dec-23 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep by company age

**Mordgier**:	This isn't really a game that you sit around and play for hours. It's basically an online idler. I touch it twice a day and that's really it.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I schedule my ships to arrive either in the morning or before bed and that's the two times I poke around for a bit.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	To be fair, some people DO play it far more by playing the market, but too much actual effort for me.

**VonAxe**:	anyone around to answer my newb question?


[03-Jan-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Go for it


[03-Jan-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	I have a contract from NEO (game company I guess) to provision x to spot y. but I dont get produc x? I need to buy or produce that myself?


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep, that's right.  You have to buy it or produce it and then transport it.


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	well nice. buying it is more expensive then the payout I get. and I'm in week 1 so producing isn't happening


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You should do the calculation to determine if it is even profitable at all to do


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	thx :)


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	yeah I am doing those now :P


[03-Jan-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	its not


[03-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, then don't do it :)


[03-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	I thought I would get the product form the npc company since they asked me to delever it anyway


[03-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	yeah I signed up but I can just "not complete" right?


[03-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Those guys are demanding :)


[03-Jan-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea that should work.


[03-Jan-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	thx for the help Ravick


[03-Jan-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	np


[03-Jan-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	another newb question?


[03-Jan-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	sure


[03-Jan-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	having more then one extractor or smelter, do I need to task them individually or can I command both of the same building to just do the same task in half the time?


[03-Jan-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	meaning, do I get a giant list of buildings? or do they stack?


[03-Jan-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	and how smart is it to have mutiple?


[03-Jan-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	They stack, so you just put orders in and they are assigned to the buildings in that order


[03-Jan-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	cool


[03-Jan-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	so time gets shorter


[03-Jan-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	do I get to devide multiple extrators between 2 types of ore?


[03-Jan-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	or is it 1 type and just shorter times so que is diverse to get differnt types


[03-Jan-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You don't get shorter times


[03-Jan-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You put in orders to the extractor and it pulls out whichever ore you put in the order


[03-Jan-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	again in the same sequence that you put the orders in


[03-Jan-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	thx. :) that'll work for planning how to build


[03-Jan-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You can play around with it


[03-Jan-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	yeah and knowing they will stack helps alot. thx


[03-Jan-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I mean the orders will stack in the order list but once the order list is empty then the buildings stop working, so unless you have recurring orders then you have to stay on top of the orders


[03-Jan-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	yeah or just make more items at a time so the timer goes up for the order


[03-Jan-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	but then just have enough resource it wont stop your lines


[03-Jan-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That's right


[03-Jan-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep


[03-Jan-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok, I gotta bounce - good luck and have fun


[03-Jan-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VonAxe**:	thx :) have a good night

**Danmai**:	I have been playing for a few days and I can say it is an absolute waste to do any Contracts, as you only end up losing money on fuel and the waiting time on whatever you built is horrendous


[07-Feb-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	I don't agree, I think the pace is perfect, you only need to check around every 8-12 hours


[07-Feb-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	you can also click on the "finances" btn on the left to check the actual value of your work, its not only the liquid assets that matter

**JeSper537**:	If someone wants some investment money hit me up. You are gonna need to have PRO to send me contracts. Calculate how much money you are gonna need to build a factory and supply it with input materials, and then how much output will equal that cost, and how long will it take to make. The final contract would be me paying you for a set amount of materials delivered in the future. I will any inputs for PG, EPO, and supplies for T1 and T2 workforce.

**Mordgier**:	Make LST. Sell me LST. Problem solved


[13-Feb-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	is it actually more profitable than building my own self-sustained system?


[13-Feb-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Do the math on a full extractor base doing noting but LST here.


[13-Feb-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	In the long run, sure there are far more profitable ventures, but for low upfront costs and effort here, LST is very compelling as long as prices don't drop under 100


[13-Feb-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Current LST prices are insane.


[13-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	But hey I have an angle on this as I probably consume more LST than any other player in the game today


[13-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I'm basing this on making X2 more MCG than the 2nd highest MCG producer in the game over the past 180d


[13-Feb-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	So having LST prices lower is desirable for me - and the only way to attain that is to increase supply


[13-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Overall though "self sustaining" is a trap.


[13-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	You can get there, but to make it optimal you will need many bases to benefit from COGC and experts in colonies


[13-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Hihi22** joined.*


[13-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you are not benefiting from COGC or experts, you are leaving a lot of money on the table. There are cases where it makes sense to go counter to the COGC, but you will want to focus on your experts at the very least.


[13-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	If you try to run manufacturing, agriculture, extraction etc all in one place - it's just not going to make you as much income as focusing on a specific category would.


[13-Feb-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	how much LST, say per week, would be reliable


[13-Feb-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	for you, that is


[13-Feb-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	thanks for the analysis btw, but my intention was to produce all my pioneer requirements, and then focus on a metal/alloy like steel, as a short-term plan until I make the big bucks


[13-Feb-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I use ~450-500 LST per day


[13-Feb-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	but for us to work privately, I'd need to get the PRO, correct?


[13-Feb-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Yup.


[13-Feb-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Personally, I think this game is borderline unplayable without pro. Some folks manage, but some folks really like to punch themselves in the balls...


[13-Feb-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flapjack**:	guilty


[13-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	I'll probably get PRO eventually, but 8 euros is sadly bit much in my country atm. so until I explore all core functionalities of the game, I'm riding free

[14-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Given the current LST prices, if I was just starting out, all I'd be doing is banging on rocks


[14-Feb-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	It's dull, but it's zero effort money. You just have to supply workers and get the LST to the market. No inputs beyond that.


[14-Feb-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I wouldn't recommend that as a long term goal though as many folks who do down the LST path here get bored and quit - you should use the income from LST as a foundation for the rest


[14-Feb-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	what spesial about valis tho? or its tne LST that is too valiable?


[14-Feb-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Vallis has a COGC (Chamber of Global Commerce) that focuses on Metallurgy so it gets a 25% bonus to Metallurgy


[14-Feb-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	plus you get more FEO per EXT on Vallis so it's just a smoother faster metallurgy start than Montem


[14-Feb-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	For Montem, I'd say for a new player just start with digging up and selling LST until you can afford a CHP - run LST -> FLX until you can afford to buy/ship the mats to branch out into more profitable recipes in CHP and POL

**FireFreak**:	good ol drama


[15-Feb-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Beign a governor for the most part just means you go shopping for supplies for the planet


[15-Feb-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Also the whole idea of "get em cuts" is pretty bogous as in general the margins if any are tiny and many planets are governed at a loss with it just being done for 'fun'. I'm sure you could just take the money and run and not fill any of the upkeep - it's been done before, but really if you want to go scamming just go pirate


[15-Feb-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alitron**:	what does it mean to 'pirate' though


[15-Feb-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mordgier**:	Best way to pirate would be to just accept ALL The shipping contracts at ALL the CXs. Sure you'll get blacklisted after, but you'll have probably made a few mil


[15-Feb-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Sure you'll be shunned after, but you can then get extra shunning by using all the stolen money to screw up the market, DW, RAT, you pick

**Myrtenaster**:	Most ores or minerals are things people usually have a surplus of on their production lines so they sell the excess on the CX but people who need that mat often set up their own ext base so the prices are lower than their wrought product. The wrought product like FE, AL, or S are usually bought much more frequently. So its worth looking into ores and minerals if you want to set up a "middle man" type production


[22-Feb-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	E.g. if I need AL I can either buy from the CX or set up my own metallurgy base. If I set up EXT on an ALO planet I'd rather mine slightly more ALO than my SMEs need so over time I end up with a surplus of ALO that I'll sell for a cheap price on the cx just to get rid of it

[25-Feb-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	They had mentioned in the past that they wanted bases to consume electricity to run - but exactly how they  intended to make it work wasn't really sorted out yet


[25-Feb-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	even just having a recipe in the chem factory is sufficient for now, they can always rework it later once they figure the power part out. but it's just such a glaring gap since it's so utterly simple to do in real life

**Strake**:	I am perplexed. I've counted and double checked the current buildings I have on this base, and they should be using only 985 area, but my overview insists they are using 990 (which of course stops me from putting up the last building I wanted)


[29-Feb-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Being off by 5, I am suspicious of the 5 HBB I have.


[29-Feb-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If your HBBs are old (i.e. before the patch they reduced the area requirements), they still take up the original amount of space

[29-Feb-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	Manufacturer


[29-Feb-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	i should have started as a miner or farmer and worked up from there


[29-Feb-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	You could always COLIQ.  I started as constructor and I kind of agree with you that starting in the middle of the chain is a bit less straightfoward


[29-Feb-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	yeah i liquidated once already for an even worse start than this


[29-Feb-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	but im finally almost bootstrapped so dont want to start over just yet


[29-Feb-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	What are you making, MCG?


[29-Feb-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	ill be in better shape once i get some more habs built


[29-Feb-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	working toward prefabs


[29-Feb-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	i have two extractors, the two BMPs i started with, a PP1 and a smelter


[29-Feb-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Nice.


[29-Feb-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	first batch of iron just rolled out of the smelter a few hours ago, the extractors have just about pulled enough to finish the prefab queu i have for the new habs


[29-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, being able to build your expansion is nice as long as you can feed people in the mean time


[29-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	yeah that's definitely the next set of buildings. need to pull water and start a farm or two. need the carbon anyways


[29-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	so might as well make my own overalls rations and drinking water


[29-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Buying worker consumables is an option


[29-Feb-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	that's what im doing so far, but im spending a fortune on fuel and i need the carbon for the iron refinery anyways so as long as i have the space i might as well


[29-Feb-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	ah yeah on a new planet making RAT and DW could definitely make sense, I thought you were planning on doing that on Montem


[29-Feb-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	oh yeah i mean on Montem, i only have one planet so far


[29-Feb-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	trying to get somewhat self-sufficient on this one as much as possible


[29-Feb-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	as slow as these facilities are im likely to have a surplus anyhow, so might as well try it


[29-Feb-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	I see, Montem isn't all that fertile.


[29-Feb-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	oh i see


[29-Feb-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Verdant is quite a nice planet for growing stuff, fertile, lots of H2O and O, obviously it is a bit of a hike and you need some money before expanding though.


[29-Feb-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	are you refering to the local market or CX?


[05-Mar-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	I'm not sure what prices to check to be completely honest


[05-Mar-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	I guess the local market?


[05-Mar-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	I've put up an ad , if someone can offer that 20 units of iron, I'll cancel my trade order at the station


[05-Mar-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	Are you still on a free license?


[05-Mar-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	put that in a buffer and it'll bring it up


[05-Mar-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	don't skimp on the training videos.  You'll have a much easer time doing them


[05-Mar-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Found it, you were offering 600 NCC but the price I see is 47,60 NCC, how come?


[05-Mar-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	oh wait, I'm confusing commodities


[05-Mar-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	oh wait no, it is FEO


[05-Mar-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	I see FEO at 47,60, how come you're offering more than x10 the price I see in the market?


[05-Mar-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	that's iron ore:FEO


[05-Mar-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Ohh, you are not looking for the ore


[05-Mar-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	I want to buy Iron: FE


[05-Mar-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	in the 'metal' catolog orz


[05-Mar-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Ohh


[05-Mar-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Well, I'm in the metallurgy business, so I will be able to provide you it, eventually


[05-Mar-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	Took me a min to figure out FeO was not hematite lol


[05-Mar-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	I could start with smelting right now actually


[05-Mar-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	you should have everything you need to mine it and process it


[05-Mar-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	forget about it....I was looking for local exchange=_=


[05-Mar-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	it saves fuel and time


[05-Mar-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	is this not local exchange?


[05-Mar-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	oh that's a pro thing?


[05-Mar-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	@bobwise yah I don't have a refinery up at the moment


[05-Mar-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	yes


[05-Mar-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	So pro players just don't have an incentive to trade with free players?


[05-Mar-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medianox0681**:	A lot is still done at the CX


[05-Mar-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	if you want to sell stuff, go to the CX, which will cost you fuel(most players do in this way))


[05-Mar-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Alright... well I'll have the iron tomorrow if you're still interested at that point


[05-Mar-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	but sometimes we can sell or buy stuff at local markets(for 'pro and normal' licensed players


[05-Mar-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	Oh I see, so normal license is sort of a one time purchase


[05-Mar-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorentius**:	and pro license is keep extra features

**Mordgier**:	Trying to mine Iron here is illogical when Vallis exists.


[06-Mar-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Metallurgy starts here are not going to do that well - your best bet would be to make FLX and use that for FE refining on Vallis where you'll actually be mining and smelting


[06-Mar-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Vallis has been living on ghost plots for a while now. It has more than Montem (146 to 68)


[06-Mar-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Closest good FEO is Sabaton but it has high pressure and low temp so its expensive. Best option is probably Kiruna with Libertas construction COGC in the same system


[06-Mar-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	I started as construction here mining my own LST and buying FE at the cx, it's pretty good seeing as you build your own expansion mats, but I'd recommend messing about on prunplanner with their planet finder and base planner to see what works for you :)

[06-Mar-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MSquared**:	After playing for a month or so, there is at least 1 good argument for making FE here - diversification. If LST prices crash, at least you'll have an alternative product to profit off.

**Bobwise**:	how many RAT&DW shall I buy at a time? it consumes 10 units of each if I have around 200+ pioneers. Isn't it a high cost of 2000NCC per day:(?


[07-Mar-24 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	is it necessary to keep BM working, which occupies 100 pioneers, a large drain on base supplies...


[07-Mar-24 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Friedrich03**:	I buy supplies for 10 days. Whether you want to keep he BMP or not is up to you. If you keep it running constantly, it will very likely be profitable. But you could also generate profit by demolishing it and building something else for your pioneers to do.


[07-Mar-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	thx:)


[07-Mar-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	you can use prunplanner or make a spreadsheet that will tell you the costs of production for each building/product and find what works best for you. Pretty much every input>output generates profit if its traded frequently on the cx but its all about opportunity costs for which products you want to make :)

**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for players <180d old who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). You can DM me for details, or head over to the UFO Discord post (Under Galactic Deals).


[22-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Hello everyone. New guy here. There seems to be a lot going on here.


[22-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Like a lot, in my face, all at once.


[22-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	There is ;) Feel free to ask questions if you have any


[22-Mar-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Thanks, I did the onboarding stuff and now I think I have nothing to do except wait for these first production orders to complete


[22-Mar-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The productions are in real time, so you take a break from the game most of the time. What most of us did though was to start playing around with different expansion plans in the meantime


[22-Mar-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	There an expansion planner in here somewhere?


[22-Mar-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can check out the community resources page in the wiki, but most of us use PrunPlanner.org


[22-Mar-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Domaldel**:	What are you producing Rook_Drekar?


[22-Mar-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Perhaps we can help eachother?


[22-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Welcome new folks.


[22-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	*waves*


[22-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Hi =)


[22-Mar-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	So, what are you all producing?


[22-Mar-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I'm currently mainly producing MCG and BSE and *trying* to get my first extractor...


[22-Mar-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I also bought myself a rig  (because I thought you could split water into hydrogen and oxygen and I had the spare resources earlier)


[22-Mar-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	MCG & BBH


[22-Mar-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Turns out you can't.


[22-Mar-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	So I'm going to have to demolish my rig to afford my extractor.


[22-Mar-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I also got a smelter without any resources in it.'


[22-Mar-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	But I expect to use it once I get the extractor.


[22-Mar-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	BBH, that uses two iron, right?


[22-Mar-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Yea


[22-Mar-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Do you have more iron then limestone?


[22-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I do not, just what the game started me with


[22-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Ah, right.


[22-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	BSE is made with just one iron.


[22-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah you can build an EXT to get limestone and FEO, a SME to turn FEO into FE and then build BSE and BBH with FE and LST


[22-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	And apparently there's quite a market for it.


[22-Mar-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	one thing you will eventually learn though is that though this planet is highly recommended as a good fit for the constructor start it actually has the wrong CoGC (chamber of global commerce) -- don't sweat it too much for now but just know that this is not the most ideal planet for construction for that reason.


[22-Mar-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Ah, it appears when you queue up orders, they don't consume the mat immediately. So I definitely need more iron.


[22-Mar-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Yeah.


[22-Mar-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	also realize that if you've decided you want to try a different planet or starting profession you can use the COLIQ command, no shame in restarting at all.  but do some research before restarting.


[22-Mar-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Once you get a extractor and a smelter you'll need oxygen and carbon to smelt the iron ore into iron.


[22-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	A guy mentioned that.


[22-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yes, indeed


[22-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Use the FLX recipe


[22-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	The number of planets available to this faction that I could find was pretty limited though.


[22-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	And only this one was actually well suited for one of the professions.


[22-Mar-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I got a friend that joined the game, but in another faction... :-/


[22-Mar-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	He's on Promitor in the Hortus system...


[22-Mar-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I hear the Promitor governor is a great guy


[22-Mar-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Maybe.


[22-Mar-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Tried to trade with my friend.


[22-Mar-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The Promitor governor gives free fabs to new players?  Nice :D


[22-Mar-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	So I need iron and silicon to keep my chains going, should I just go buy those now?


[22-Mar-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Nice try @Aahz ;)


[22-Mar-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Got a pro license, and ended up wasting most of my ICA on warehouses, the ad board there and stuff like that...


[22-Mar-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Prom might be the most populous planet in the game, didnt' realize it was +494 plots.. sheesh.


[22-Mar-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I'm also sitting on a pile of PE for some reason

**Aahz**:	BDE and BTA require PE to build


[22-Mar-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Use the mat command to learn more about a commodity, like mat pe will show you all the stuff you can make from it


[22-Mar-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	You can use PE for BDE, BTA, OVE and STR it looks like.


[22-Mar-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	huh, okay, so I should queue up some of these other products since I'll run out of iron and silicon pretty quick here


[22-Mar-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	While your ship is on its way to the space station to sell your stuff and buy more of what you need, yeah, I guess.


[22-Mar-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	We got a comodity exchange right here in our star system.


[22-Mar-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	So you'll only need slower then light speed fuel to get there (and ship parts for maintainence)


[22-Mar-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I've already used up the STL fuel I got from the beginning contracts.


[22-Mar-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	By the way Rook, I send you a private message.


[22-Mar-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Is there any way to send my ships to a specific players base?


[22-Mar-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	If I want to trade with them for instance.


[22-Mar-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Or is the only way through contracts and trade and stuff?


[22-Mar-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	If you have pro you can send a contract to someone or create buy and sell orders on the local market.


[22-Mar-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	*nods*


[22-Mar-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Domaldel**:	Just wish I had a way to trade with people with free licenses...


[22-Mar-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Other then the commodity exchange...


[22-Mar-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, the game is a bit more single player with a free license.


[22-Mar-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I wish it was possible to *accept* player contracts with free, even if you can't make them...


[22-Mar-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	if you buy pro one time when it expires you get a basic license, I believe with a basic license you can accept other people's contracts and local market orders.


[22-Mar-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	So it's a in between free and pro?


[22-Mar-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, that page I linked should describe it in more detail.


[22-Mar-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	The page only shows free and pro.


[22-Mar-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Ah, accept local market ads.


[22-Mar-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Nothing about contracts though.

[22-Mar-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Spanish mostly, but I'm attempting Latin and Japanese as well.


[22-Mar-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Yeah, I'm no good with non-germanic language.


[22-Mar-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	(I live in Norway)


[22-Mar-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Ya'll think a ware house early on at the exchange is worth it? I already rented it but it seems useful and cheap.


[22-Mar-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Very useful, even just as a buffer for more storage. Unlike planet warehouses, you can have unlimited lots in a cx warehouse


[22-Mar-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	How much space do you have for things you buy if you don't rent a warehouse there?'


[22-Mar-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	If you don't have a cx warehouse, the only storage you have is the ship you have docked there


[22-Mar-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	If you buy something from the cx and there isn't enough storage, it is in your Contracts, locked up until you have the storage to accept it


[23-Mar-24 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Thank you, just ran out of cash for my warehouses...

**Rook_Drekar**:	Hey fellow owners. Quick question, when do more pioneers show up?


[23-Mar-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	On Montem you should immediately get pioneers when you buy a new hab unit.


[23-Mar-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	14.1% unemployment for Pioneers and 249k pioneers on the planet so there are plenty of them available if I'm reading the population report right.


[23-Mar-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I built another hab but no new pioneers showed up. Do I need to have work for them to?


[23-Mar-24 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	So this faction contract I got as part of this weird onboarding tutorial thing wants a bunch of different mats and the payout is 30k, but the going rate for all the mats is like 120k. Is the 40 faction rep worth this? This seems pretty steep for a new player.


[23-Mar-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, skip it if it won't be profitable.


[23-Mar-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I already accepted it ><


[23-Mar-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Just let it breach then, there is no meaningful penalty for letting faction contracts breach that I know of.

**Myrtenaster**:	No penalty if you let a faction contract breach except you lose the amount of faction rep the contract would have been worth. Which barely matters anyway


[24-Mar-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	40 rep is a lot, double check that that contract is asking you to "provision" the resources (aka you give them to the faction) or just show the resources (sometimes you just have them in your inventory for "inspection" and you keep the resources after the contract is complete)


[24-Mar-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Provision


[24-Mar-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Yeah that's a huge loss then. Faction rep only dictates the intensity of the contracts. e.g. at 100 rep you might be asked to give 10 resource for 10 currency, but at 1000 rep you give 100 resource for 100 currency


[24-Mar-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	that's as far as I understand it anyway


[24-Mar-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	So just let it lapse then?


[24-Mar-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	There must be some odd randomness going on as well though -- at least as somoene who has been playing for 44 days now I've never seen a contract that was worth anywhere near that 40 factoin rep.  1-3 is typical.


[24-Mar-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	CONT 4EPFVKI


[24-Mar-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aahz**:	It wont' load, but it also doesn't show an error like you would get if you did CONT abc


[24-Mar-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah I've never seen a contract that asked for more than one thing to fulfill.  Though I haven't been playing that long.


[24-Mar-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Yea, its unfortunate. I should have taken one of the other options. oh well.


[24-Mar-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I hope letting it lapse wont tank my rep


[24-Mar-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	I think it will give you -40 rep.  The conventional wisdom is that faction rep does nothing except possibly makes future contracts juicier.  If you are really worried about it you could COLIQ


[24-Mar-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Nah, I already did that.I wanna make this one work.


[24-Mar-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Rook_Drekar what kind of contracts you looking for? Shipping?


[24-Mar-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Yea, anything around the local area for now. I got an idle ship so I figured I might put it to use.


[24-Mar-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll post some shipping Montem -> MOR


[24-Mar-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I'm also just looking for any opportunities in general.


[24-Mar-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sounds good, I'll keep that in mind :}


[24-Mar-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Woah, look at these!


[24-Mar-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If you take one of them, don't worry about flying quickly to the station, just get there in a reasonable amount of time and save on fuel :]


[24-Mar-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I mean, I'd take them all truthfully. I can run both ships and get 2 packages delivered per run.


[24-Mar-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	But, I'll take only two for now. Probably would'nt be fair to take them all


[24-Mar-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Well in that case unless you find something more profitable, I can arrange for you to do some of my Montem -> MOR shipping


[24-Mar-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Yea, I'm just finished an expansion so I can run some shipping for you.


[24-Mar-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I got time before I make my next move


[24-Mar-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sounds good - just leave me a message if you're interested in some shipping and I'll try to respond in a reasonable time :]


[24-Mar-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Cool, I'll add you as a contact. Your first 2 packages are on their way!


[24-Mar-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Right on.


[24-Mar-24 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Is it etiquette to fulfill the payment before I've delivered the goods? I've noticed that on other shipping contracts I've taken the client pays out pretty quickly after I take their package.


[24-Mar-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I've had such a small amount of issues with public contracting that I just trust people to get the stuff there within the timeframe, giving them the payment as soon as possible so they can use if earlier if they need


[24-Mar-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Huh, well, good to know there are still honest folks out there.


[24-Mar-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think I've only had one case where the person was intentionally screwing it up


[24-Mar-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I've had a handful of people screw up shipping contracts, but it was due to lack of understanding so I obviously didn't mind :]


[24-Mar-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Understandable. Keeping an eye on the global chat. seems like there is a healthy amount of new folk each day.


[24-Mar-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	They have a history here?


[24-Mar-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think not too long after I started playing, maybe a month in they had a report against them for such actions


[24-Mar-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	They're relatively active in global chat, not sure if their 'piracy' is intentionally or just neglect :p


[24-Mar-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Well, I'll keep an eye out for pirates. For now I think I am much happier fulfilling contracts than writing them, I just don't have the production to warrant it. Sans some peer to peer stuff with some friends.


[24-Mar-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye, early on you're usually on the recieving end of contracts, if you're doing any at all


[24-Mar-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	It looks like there is a strong contingent of players voting for Chem


[25-Mar-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Is this s big place for chemistry too?


[25-Mar-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	because chem is better


[25-Mar-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	FLX is probably the reason why they originally advocated for chem


[25-Mar-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	wow, one LST to make 10 FLX? and FLX looks like it has a nice little return on it


[25-Mar-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HanAti**:	Everyone loves their flux. Plus its used in practically all smelting


[25-Mar-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Do anyone know if settlers can work as pioneers?


[25-Mar-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I currently have 200 pioneers but need 290.


[25-Mar-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	they cant


[25-Mar-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	I'm also planning on getting a chemical plant that needs some settlers.


[25-Mar-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	So I'm thinking of getting a barracks.


[25-Mar-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	That'll give me 75 pioneers and 75 settlers.


[25-Mar-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Just 15 pioneers short.


[25-Mar-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Domaldel**:	Mind you, the chemical plant also needs another 20 pioneers so I'll be 35 pioneers short after that...

**MysteriousWalrus**:	When you build out your base more, HBBs can be more space efficient than HB1s and HB2s combined


[26-Mar-24 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	oh wow. i never realized what HBBs, HBCs, etc. did until now that I've read it... 3 bases in : D


[26-Mar-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	They have their uses! One of the past few uodates they made the hybrid habitats take up even less space making them (at least some?) worthwhile

**Stephanator**:	hey folks, if youre going to open transport contracts between the station and here, if you keep the volume under 400/400 there's a lot of folks just starting out that'd actually be able to pick it up far sooner than waiting for an empty from an established player


[26-Mar-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	way harder to get bootstrapped without any consistent transport contracts to supplement fuel costs


[26-Mar-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for players <180d old who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). You can DM me for details, or head over to the UFO Discord post (Under Galactic Deals).

[26-Mar-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HanAti**:	I've got a ton of expansion planned over the next few weeks


[26-Mar-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Not necessarily, but I do make a lot it seems


[26-Mar-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Mar-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Stephanator**:	am i capped out on structures? how do i get use of the full 500?


[27-Mar-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Developed > What you have occupied. Available > What you have left.


[27-Mar-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Mar-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Mar-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	If you need more after the 500, you can use a permit


[27-Mar-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	i think i should be good. i want one more smelter, another collector, and a chem, plus housing


[27-Mar-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	if i did my math right i think that should allow me to produce steel without production breaks


[27-Mar-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Mar-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rook_Drekar**:	Ah, the Oxygen


[27-Mar-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	yeah need a lot of it for the FE and STL production


[27-Mar-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Apr-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	New farmer, any tips?


[10-Apr-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	I'm a new construction guy so can't really help xD


[10-Apr-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	but probably figure out what you want to process into then grow that stuff?


[10-Apr-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Well, right now, I want to produce foodstuffs.  Will need a lot more rigs than I can build to get enough water fast enough


[10-Apr-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	someone sent a planning website too the other day where you can see how much profit certain things can make and stuff, lemme send it hold on


[10-Apr-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	I looked at that, it seems water is more expensive to produce than buy atm


[10-Apr-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	so you might be better off just buying it on Moria station


[10-Apr-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**_iNefarious_**:	especially since a rig only produces 2 water every 5ish hours


[10-Apr-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	every 7.5 hours


[10-Apr-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	TBH, I have no idea what I am doing or supposed to do.


[10-Apr-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	It's better to  start at Promitor as a farmer


[10-Apr-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	dont worry made, we all had that. since you landed at montem take advantage of the planet


[10-Apr-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	if you are dead set at argi/food you need another planet


[10-Apr-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	it has the best fertility and a global commerce campaign of agriculture


[10-Apr-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	I was planing on starting at Verdant, but the window has an alert that it is far from any exchange, so I came here


[10-Apr-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Once I have the money, I will branch into either Metalurgist or Carbon Farmer...eventually both


[10-Apr-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	FYI agriculture and food industry isnt the same


[10-Apr-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	nearest planet with food idustry bonus us pallada


[10-Apr-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	Moria - Pallada (OT-580d)


[10-Apr-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Sure, but first tier products rarely are profitable in any game.  Gotta go at least 2nd tier.


[10-Apr-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	chemical plant:)


[10-Apr-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Pallada was not available for selection when I made the account.


[10-Apr-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	if you stay here build a CHP take advantage of the bonus


[10-Apr-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	chemical plant or polymer plant, the later requires only a few crews


[10-Apr-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	can buy the ingredients and produce PG, it's really fast and profitable


[10-Apr-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Crew is no problem...got 80 pioneers sitting idle


[10-Apr-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	more crew eat more


[10-Apr-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	imo start with a chem plant, it has alot of recipes to pick, start with something cheap and then move up


[10-Apr-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	extract some LST and FLX is free


[10-Apr-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Do I have to have a ship at the exchange to be able to buy stuff?


[10-Apr-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	you can rent a warehouse


[10-Apr-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You can rent a warehouse at the exchange OR, when you buy stuff, it will be sent you in a contract that you can "fulfill" and pick up when a ship is there


[10-Apr-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Obviously having a warehouse at the exchange is cheap and well worth it, just depends on if you want to have one to start


[10-Apr-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	6h to get my ship to Moria Station


[10-Apr-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	point you will have to go the CX to take the stuff


[10-Apr-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	grrr...one day, I will learn


[10-Apr-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	another thing, at first you dont make alot of money so every 100SF is 1200NCC off your profit


[10-Apr-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	take it slow until you can afford it


[10-Apr-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	SF is fuel for your ship


[10-Apr-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	That is why it takes me 6 hours to get to Moria Station.  Could have gone faster, but decided to spend less than 150SF to get there


[10-Apr-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	suggest to wait for enough long tine to launch fully loaded ships


[10-Apr-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	go get the stuff you want and start making but for a better outcome, plan your trips a head, with 15hours travel you are at 60SF


[10-Apr-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	instead of 300SF you lose 120 there and back


[10-Apr-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Ya, with my current production speeds, I don't see myself filling a ship anytime soon...


[10-Apr-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	can gather some delivery faction contracts and do them in 1 run, and sell/buy stuff at Moria Station


[10-Apr-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	faction contracts come nearly 2 times per dday


[10-Apr-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	At the start you get faction contracts every 12-16h, as your company ages the time between contracts gets longer :p


[10-Apr-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Rented warehouse, bought water, instead of putting the water in warehouse, I got money refunded as a contract to pick up the water was created

[10-Apr-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	in 2 days, I'll take my first load of Limestone (44 units) and Iron (15 units) to market and buy some more overalls, drinking water and food


[10-Apr-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	I might move there once I can build a second base.  Just want to be viable and I already introduced myself to Montem when I was a farmer, so I'll stay here


[10-Apr-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Yeah, I'm looking at moving to doing some chem here on Montem


[10-Apr-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	I started Metalurgist too


[10-Apr-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Once I can afford it, I'll build a PP1


[10-Apr-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Although, probably gonna try to get a collector next, to harvest my own oxygen.


[10-Apr-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eretra**:	Oxygen is pretty cheap at the exchange, it's not really profitable to harvest it here


[10-Apr-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	ok


[10-Apr-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Was thinking of producing for my smelter, rather than trade.  That way, I only need to buy Carbon to make Iron


[10-Apr-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eretra**:	Yeah, I know, but you'll still be better buying oxygen for it


[10-Apr-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Apr-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kruks**:	Or set up a variable in which you can apply to certain windows that accept that type of variable


[11-Apr-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	That would be so nice, just some light conditional scripting would be dope. I mean, this is a spreadsheet game after all, and most spreadsheet software has scripting

[11-Apr-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	like the default trading screen, just be able to swap RAT to DW or OVE?

**Jacob_Evans**:	Ish lol


[12-Apr-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The tutorials don't mention CoGC and there is no way for starting players to see them on planets so a lot of people end up picking starts that don't match the planet CoGC unfortunately.


[12-Apr-24 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ruky11**:	Did I pick the wrong planet? :/


[12-Apr-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Ish? You can still do well on it, its just gonna be a slower start.


[12-Apr-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	What i would say to do is to learn what you can atm, then use COLIQ to reset and make a more informed choice


[12-Apr-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	And ask questions! the Corp i'm in is a bunch of newbies who are all trying to help each other out


[12-Apr-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Discord and the global channels are also good places to ask questions.  And definitely don't sweat a COLIQ if you decide you want to change it up.


[12-Apr-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ruky11**:	Thank you

**Kilravok**:	I also am metallurgist.  Will see how it goes when I manage to finish my first production run and ship it to market.


[12-Apr-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	You a metallurgist on Montem?


[12-Apr-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	yup


[12-Apr-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	huh, I thought all the Metallurgists were on Vallis


[12-Apr-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	probably a more optimum location, but I went here.


[12-Apr-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Alright, welcome to the best planet


[12-Apr-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	That's what I thought


[12-Apr-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	However...what the heck happened? I remember the resources indicator on Planet Info showing a larger bar for Oxygen...


[12-Apr-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Lemme check


[12-Apr-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	I may be mistaken, but it seems to me


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Well, According to Prun PLanner, Montem has an O rating of about 10 and Vallis has an O rating of about 8


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	So, Montem is better?


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	BUT


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Vallis has way more FEO


[12-Apr-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	I never seen Vallis's details, but I thought to remember, O having a larger bar when I started than it currently has


[12-Apr-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	I guess not


[12-Apr-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	must be just me, then


[12-Apr-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Vallis does have a better COCG though, so you are missing out on a lot of efficiency gains


[12-Apr-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Maybe when I can build a second base


[12-Apr-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	So, in all reality, metallurgy as a start on Montem isn't the best bet


[12-Apr-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Should probably just build Chem plants and LST extractors like everyone else here haha


[12-Apr-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	maybe it makes sense to ignore O2? it's so scarce in either Montem or Vallis


[12-Apr-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	And Vallis is definitely much better for Metallurgy


[12-Apr-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	because of its COGC


[12-Apr-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	oh well...eventually, I will be able to build a chem plant and a second base...


[12-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	That's the spirit. And if you need any help or advice, just ask away

[13-Apr-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flapjack**:	stop extracing iron and extract limestone if your mining for profit


[13-Apr-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bezborg**:	zoinks, the fuel cost between montem and moria station is steep


[18-Apr-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	The time cost :D


[18-Apr-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	It depends on the orbital positions, I see < 5 hours for 150 STL fuel for a starter ship right now which doesn't seem so bad.


[18-Apr-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Yeah, orbital mechanic play a part


[18-Apr-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	usually, how often to repair a production line?


[18-Apr-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	or how much percentage of condition can I repair once?


[18-Apr-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Depends on the building, but either 45, 60 or 90 days is the standard.


[18-Apr-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	It takes 180 days to reach max degradation, so if a building takes 6 BBH, every 30 days 1 BBH will degrade, so you want to repair just before day 30 or just before day 60.


[18-Apr-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Then just adjust to find the optimal days per building


[18-Apr-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	that makes sense, thx:)

[23-Apr-24 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobwise**:	it will work but at very low efficiency


[23-Apr-24 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	in that case, it will be a month or two before I can use it.  Construction materials are bloody expensive


[23-Apr-24 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	back in 15 hours


[23-Apr-24 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	not necessarily very low efficiency, just relative to the amount of workers you have


[23-Apr-24 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have 2xTNPand 3xAML - so lots of advanced material processing, TNP does stuff with TC (mostly used as inputs to make HSE) and the AML makes BE/ZR/etc - stuff used in shipbuilding.


[23-Apr-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	I use my Montem base as a starter for expansion. I started with fabs production, then LST extraction, CHPs, POLs for PG, POLs for EPO, and WPL for KV. I've offshored 95% of that to other bases now so I use Montem for the complicated stuff, making use of the close CX. Currently TNP, TCL, THF, KV, and BE.

[24-Apr-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	not officially, but if you have the ability to create direct contracts (i think its subscription based) then you can cancel the contract, which "pirates" the materials, ship them as you can to the destination, then put them back on contract to the owner for the same price the move was agreed on. very much not an ideal method tho and requires a lot of trust


[24-Apr-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stephanator**:	personally, i wish people would create smaller contracts

[01-May-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Have to make your own calculations based on current stock and usage per day - or - use browser addons or other Prun-focused websites that can make that calculations for you

[01-May-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	I use PMMG, it takes the data from FIO and turns it into buffers in Prun itself, among other things


[02-May-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**M-45**:	Is there a way to increase the queue?"


[02-May-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yes, at certain milestones of # of building permits you get more slots in the queue.  You can change the order size as well.


[02-May-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Levels 5, 10, 13, 16, 18 and 20 grant you additional queue slots to make managing your production queues easier.  from https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/headquarters/index.html

[06-May-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Nerdyboy** joined.*


[06-May-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	There are two types of storage, warehouses and base storage.  You can see base storage from the base inventory and that is what is full if your extractor can't extract.


[06-May-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Warehouses are separate and you can store stuff there but your extractors and production facilities can't see the inventory that is in there.


[06-May-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Also you can build a STO to extend base storage.


[06-May-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kilravok**:	Thanks


[06-May-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Maretha**:	Is it worth fulfilling contracts to earn faction points or selling products directly on the market?


[15-May-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	faction points will lead to better faction contracts, and some provide better returns then the market, so generally worth it


[15-May-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, definitely a case by case basis.  Conventional wisdom is that exploration contracts, for instance, are almost never worth it.  but delivery to a CX, especially if you are already heading there, is worth it.

[22-May-24 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rfur**:	@Kilravok flux I get, but would Ca pay back?  The extra costs of Settlers and their needs for (at the moment) 20NCC extra per unit seems tight, although I've not cranked the numbers and I could well (most likely) be missing something.  But sounds like a good idea if you can get the numbers to work as I think Fe as a product seems to be a bit of a struggle.

**Supwarl**:	could be that or maybe a major consumer decided to stop playing


[25-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tron842**:	It looks like the raw volume trading for FLX has remained about the same for the past 6 months. It looks like there was a bump in price about a month ago on some CXs and a drop in volume for about a week in late April. After that the price has trended down on all CX's. Especially in AI1. If I had to guess, a trader who was working on arbitrage either switched to something else or was gone for a week or two last month, and the local market is rebounding a bit with all the extra supply locally.


[25-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	@supwarl, my advice at least at the beggining, dont over invest in one material, focus on chem since you landed on montem. pick buildings that provide choice on recipes


[25-May-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	research all occupation and their profit, it will help you create your next base


[25-May-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Speaking of arbitrage: I kind of dislike when it's done on a large scale like some players do. I think it's prefectly acceptible when someone is doing it between CX since that helps spread the market, but I cringe when I see large volumes of both buy and sell orders on the same exchange. It's an extractive process that tends to make it harder for small/new players to get a foothold. I realize it's prefectly legal in Prun, but to me it just feels wrong, somehow? I don't know...


[25-May-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Before anyone flames me: I understand that it provides liquidity and other benefits to the market as well. It just feels slimy to me. IDK...


[25-May-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	@stosXri I have not invested into FLX yet but everyone was telling me to and I am not sure trying just to figure out what to do. I originally built 3 ext so I could ship in SI and make MCG but Im debating to do that or just throw down Chem labs

[25-May-24 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Jacob_Evans**:	I don't think so


[31-May-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	You can filter though


[31-May-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Amely98**:	would the filters be permanent in my contracts page?


[31-May-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	If you add it to a SCRN, yes, otherwise it resets in a temporary BFR


[31-May-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Amely98**:	yes, i would like to add it to my contract screen. how do i set that up with a filter?


[31-May-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	CONT has the filters at the top part of that window


[31-May-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Amely98**:	thats weird, im either blind or missing smt. just CONT seems to be an illegal command and CONTS just shows me all with no options


[31-May-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	It is CONTS, sorry, mistype on my end


[31-May-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	But look for the "Show Filters" button


[31-May-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Amely98**:	is it bc im blind or my name is not green?


[31-May-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The top of the CONTS window has a bunch of filters, draft, open, rejected, deadline exceeded, etc... you can click those to filter in or out various contracts.  If you embed that in a screen it will remember the filter.


[31-May-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Amely98**:	ok, im either going crazy or you green names are messing with me :D


[31-May-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	More often than not, people don't seriously oppose elections in this unless the current governor isn't doing a good job. Though there's the occasional funny election or new player that just runs on a big planet


[06-Jun-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Example: VH-331a has a new player run in elections every time


[06-Jun-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	If you enjoy watching millions of credits disappear down the black hole of planetary upkeep, by all means run for governor of a high population planet


[06-Jun-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	taxes and fees never cover the costs


[06-Jun-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jun-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	That would be amusing to watch on Promitor or Montem, and a good case study on how fast higher tier workers abandon ship

[07-Jun-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Starfoth**:	I can help out with some poly-eth


[07-Jun-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Starfoth**:	So how does this work?


[07-Jun-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	Usually you don't need to help out with upkeep phases as a new player


[07-Jun-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	larger players usually take care of them pretty quick so I wouldn't worry


[07-Jun-24 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Starfoth**:	My weekly expenses are 105,000 NCC


[11-Jun-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Starfoth**:	Honestly I'm wondering if I could cut out coffee, it is 14,000 NCC a week


[11-Jun-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Starfoth**:	How much would that hit my production?


[11-Jun-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	Use PrunPlanner and you can know exact numbers


[11-Jun-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir3x**:	without coffee im down to 89% ish


[11-Jun-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir3x**:	it adds a decent amount but i feel like unless you have a max capacity base its not worth it for smaller production setups


[11-Jun-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir3x**:	if you can find someone to produce it for you by you supplying the materials that would be ideal


[11-Jun-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	You can determine if it's profitable no matter what size base you have


[11-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	As Supwarl said you can see PrunPlanner for exact numbers


[11-Jun-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	And you said your weekly expenses are 105k, 14k of which is coffee. Work out your weekly revenue. Coffee adds 11% efficiency so if 14k is less than 11% of your weekly revenue then coffee is still profitable


[11-Jun-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	(Assuming your base is entirely Pioneers)


[11-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Correction - COF + PWO is 100% satisfaction. Just PWO is 86.7% satisfaction. So coffee adds 13.3%

[12-Jun-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	For a Montem PIO start, you just have to ignore the CoGC. If you want more of a straight line, then a restart on Promitor is usually recommended

**Rfur**:	I do and it seems to work well enough.  I haven't looked at the conomics though.  But for me it was the reliability of supply that was important.  Setting up a carbon chain now for the same reason.

**Supwarl**:	In my opinion based on the math I have done, is that it is much cheaper to buy from the market than to build it yourself.


[13-Jun-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	The ROI on Prun Planner shows that 1 COL on Montem will take roughly 88.5 days to pay for itslef


[13-Jun-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Supwarl**:	It just make more sense to build COLs elsewhere


[13-Jun-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Sir3x**:	i would guess that we lost production on water via a few people not returning and not having enough produced and 1 or a few were able to control it


[20-Jun-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Producer**:	but usually a monopoly is more expensive ... now water costs more than before

***Myrtenaster** deleted this message.*


[20-Jun-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	Monopolies usually lower the price as much as possible to drive out smaller suppliers by making them unprofitable, then jack up the price when they control supply. With how easy it is to set up new water suppliers in this game, a monopoly was never going to last forever. At least now those smaller suppliers (new players) can make a living


[20-Jun-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Yes, then start on verdant and grow COF for my boys in the RIM


[21-Jun-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	But COLIQ once you are a little familiar with things is not the worst option at all.  Check out all the starter planets and see what the CoGCs are and make an informed decision


[21-Jun-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pangolinvarian**:	Devs should definitely address that, like having an "advanced" setup where you can get CX and CoGC info before choosing your package


[21-Jun-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	Well, partly why COLIQ is so cheap for your first 3 I think

**Isoroku**:	Cheaper to buy and replace the RIG(s) with a different building(s) that made more credits


[27-Jun-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RustEater**:	i see. that makes sense


[27-Jun-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	Montem fertility is horrible anyway. Better to move you agriculture and dw to Verdant. Then when you max that 500 area out, move your food processors to Sand


[27-Jun-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Good advice - also as you make more expensive/rarer things - things that lots of people make, like DW and RAT are easier to outsource, rather than Z, HD or even BWS.

[27-Jun-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elemir**:	its more expensive than on cx, so good luck - perhaps you finde someone who pays more


[27-Jun-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DJ101997**:	isnt that normal though? its only a little more expensive but paying premium for time and fuel saving - or do you think i;m wrong?


[27-Jun-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DJ101997**:	im charging 36 NCC per unit and Moria Station is at 35.6 NCC so only a small premium

Additionally, I would like to hear everyone's comments, questions, and concerns about the government. What would you like the leadership to make a priority? Transparency? Popi? Taxes? Let's hear it


[05-Jul-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThinkTrout**:	Tbh Idrk about the election stuff, but I voted you because I've got mad respect for someone only 120 days old and already a governor :O


[05-Jul-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThinkTrout**:	*105 days


[05-Jul-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I'm going to be honest, just starting out I haven't looked at planetary governance much. I get that it supports pop growth and the COGC bonus, but I haven't looked that much into how all that is supported and the strategy behind it, so to speak


[05-Jul-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I kind of assumed it would stay the same, but I figure there is no harm in asking


[05-Jul-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThinkTrout**:	First major expansion? Whatcha have in mind? Just curious


[05-Jul-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThinkTrout**:	I went to Verdant to start a farm last time I tried starting on Montem


[05-Jul-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	Honestly, most of the time the COGC won't change


[05-Jul-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	COGC isn't decided on by the governer, its decided by vote of the people with bases on the planet


[05-Jul-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jacob_Evans**:	So if you have 100+ people that are all focused on Chemistry here on Montem, and 1 person who wants to do Metalurgy, the COGC is gonna stay on Chemistry.


[05-Jul-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

Whether for Anxuiz, Schaitr, Myself, or someone else, it's important that you get out there and vote. We have less than 60 total votes but we have hundreds of players here.

[09-Jul-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	When you vote, the candidate that receives the most votes becomes the governor. Depending on the Parliament size, additional players will join the government. The government decides what fees you pay to run your production lines, fees for WH, LM. The government is also generally responsible for supplying POPI consumables to keep the population happy and keep immigration stable.


[09-Jul-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	The government has a large impact on your base on the planet generally speaking.


[09-Jul-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DouglasHaig**:	where can we see what each candidate wants to do?


[09-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	There is no central place that the candidates post their campaign promises or proposals outside of this chat, and maybe in Montem Politics in the UFO discord(not an active place). Your best bet is to ask us directly. In my case, I will use the public channels to post transparency reports on the government for constituents to review.


[09-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rook_Drekar**:	If you are curious where/how to vote. you do so with this command


[09-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-24 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	If you don't have a ship or a warehouse on Moria, it'll deliver bought goods into a contract. Open CONT and you should find the BSE. If not, double check the order book to see that it was at the right price.

[14-Jul-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pfeifenson**:	Not rly. Just focus on more profitable things, sell them, buy the things you need


[14-Jul-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FinancialTimes**:	Montem has boosts to chemistry, so one thing you could do is extract limestone and turn it into flux


[14-Jul-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FinancialTimes**:	as pfeif says, cheap commodities like food and drinking water are more economical to buy from the exchange


[14-Jul-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jul-24 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**pfeifenson**:	The start is very hard in the game. Just focus on one thing at the beginning. Compare resources and the profit of making them, find something more profitable


[14-Jul-24 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pfeifenson**:	and then you can slowly build your empire with more and more things. Limestone is much better on montem then iron, make flux of it, sell the rest of your limestone

**Teemberland**:	Newb question, but to pickup drinking water, all you need to do is wait right?


[09-Aug-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	What do you mean by 'pickup'? Are you making DW? If so, yes, you just wait for it to come out of the food processor


[09-Aug-24 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teemberland**:	that was my mistake. you did answer my questi on in the other chat. thank you!


[09-Aug-24 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teemberland**:	but let me ask this, how can you get H20 to produce DW?


[09-Aug-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Hi


[16-Aug-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	hey Atomic hi


[16-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	is it better to restart the game and follow the contracts at the introductiory contracts that the game offers?


[16-Aug-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	is it worth the cash?


[16-Aug-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	the missions i didnt follow?


[16-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You mean the tutorial ones? Or just faction contracts?


[16-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	tutorial


[16-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I just wonder how you could've not followed them


[16-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	im just playing acouple of days now thats why im asking


[16-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i ignored them and they expired lol


[16-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Producer**:	if you like it ... it depends what type of game you like ... i like eve but not the piracy there ... so this is my game


[16-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Okay, so if you are actually playing just three days, yeah, you will get something like 30k credits out of them


[16-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i can restart a new company in 5 hourd


[16-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	However, note that there are so many COLIQs you can make


[16-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So make them count


[16-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Although Montem is an absoulte best IMO


[16-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	im going to use same proffesion at Montern but this time ill look Alluminium


[16-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	If you are a metallurgist, Vallis looks like a better choice


[16-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Also, looking at prices of ALO rn, doing ALO -> AL is barely profitable


[16-Aug-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	A constructor on Montem seems like the most balanced choice, in that you could invest your goods right into more buildings


[16-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	ok ill stick around but think at Moria there are better locations to set up of where i am now on the planet


[16-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Such as?


[16-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	more resourses


[16-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	my location has oiron and limestone


[16-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	iron and limestone


[16-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, a same-system CX outweights everything, resources are not that profitable and fun IMO


[16-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	what do you reccomend?


[16-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I recommend a restart as Constructor here, at Montem, or start as a Farmer somewhere else, there are some really good planets for that too


[16-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	Constructor?


[16-Aug-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	A profession, gives you a BMP, PP1 and SME at start


[16-Aug-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	For a Farmer, you can consider Promitor, that would be a solid start as well


[16-Aug-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	RAT prices seem to be going to the moon rn


[16-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Any choice would be a good one, as long as you start in a system with CX, this is my hard opinion


[16-Aug-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I once started at a Gibson, as a Constructror too, and let me tell you, it was miserable af, even though I was only two jumps away from a CX


[16-Aug-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	And as a last piece of advice - get as many shipping contracts in the early game as you can, if done right, they can become just as profitable as your base


[16-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	missed tose


[16-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	just watched the video as a constructor


[16-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	im allredy prodicing the iron need to produce limestone since i can tap the resourse


[16-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	and just silicon


[16-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**elemir**:	and use discord ... there is sb who gives you a loan of 100k for 0% interest if you are under 60d


[16-Aug-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	accumilatrd 150 k by now


[16-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Holy sht, you sit on all that money?


[16-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	yep


[16-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Did you even build anything since the start?


[16-Aug-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	just a extractor and a smelter for iron


[16-Aug-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Ok, sorry, but it seems you have trouble reinvesting your cash


[16-Aug-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	following the video


[16-Aug-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	as Mettalurgist


[16-Aug-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	150k could expand your base like twofold, you should really reinvest


[16-Aug-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	so you think i should not reset?


[16-Aug-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, where did you get that money from? Selling iron?


[16-Aug-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	no from one mission 100k contract


[16-Aug-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	buying rat and selling at the station


[16-Aug-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	had the 50k


[16-Aug-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i rented a warehouse didnt even have to fly there


[16-Aug-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Ah, so you've resold some RATs?


[16-Aug-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	yes


[16-Aug-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That's some stonks indeed


[16-Aug-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	it was a contaract was asking for 30 Rats


[16-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Where did you find it?


[16-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	contracts


[16-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	it came up as message


[16-Aug-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Ok, so I guess someone sent you a contract, as a form of help for a newbie player


[16-Aug-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Because 30 RATs cost like 4-5k, no more


[16-Aug-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	yeah i believe so


[16-Aug-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I got 15k just like that, from some really kind soul


[16-Aug-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So wiping would be really unwise


[16-Aug-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i wont restart then im in good shape then


[16-Aug-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You are in bombastic shape, bro


[16-Aug-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	so what do u reccomend my next move should be now


[16-Aug-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So, like I said before, if you have trouble reinvesting, you should go and build some PP1s. That way, you could just manufacture all your building prefabs by yourself


[16-Aug-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That way, it reframes 'investment' as 'making my own stuff'


[16-Aug-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i like the sound of it


[16-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Okay, what buildings you have right now?


[16-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	what is the building called?


[16-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	PP1


[16-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	wait


[16-Aug-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	"Prefab Plant MK1"


[16-Aug-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	2 Pioneer habitat


[16-Aug-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	extractor and smelter


[16-Aug-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Ok, so 2 PP1s will fit right in real snuggly


[16-Aug-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That essentially would be my base a week ago


[16-Aug-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Each PP1 will cost you like 25k on CX in materials


[16-Aug-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You will also need another habitat


[16-Aug-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So I think you should stop at these three buildings, then get a lot of materials to sustain your base


[16-Aug-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	i got MSG 99 and BSE15


[16-Aug-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Oh wow, nice, that's another 30k worth of stuff


[16-Aug-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You could theoretically get a BMP and another habitat then, too, but I think that would be too brief of an expansion for a newbie


[16-Aug-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So, my final suggestions are: 2 PP1s, a Pioneers habitat and a lot of materials to sustain your base


[16-Aug-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	All should fit in one shipment


[16-Aug-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	and a basic material plant?


[16-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, get a BMP at your own risk. My suggested list of purchases will cost you something like 80k or maybe more, getting a BMP and another habitat will be 40k more


[16-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So you will be left with no more than 30k of free cash


[16-Aug-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eagles20**:	ill stick at the ones you suggested at first and get the BMP later


[16-Aug-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So I suggest you do not take the BMP and instead slowly burn the remaining cash over the course of a week or two to build more buildings gradually with your homegrown prefabs

[18-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-24 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wazul**:	Like when I started I remember Montem not having any available plots but it still let me start here. I'm kinda confused.


[26-Aug-24 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	When you start your first base, you can do that even on already filled planets


[26-Aug-24 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	turns out doing that isn't very profitable but it's satisfying :P


[26-Aug-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I think it's common. People start here and realize it isn't ideal for early game and move off. I did it myself even. I've been watching it fluctuate for quite some time.

**EnemyCube**:	I ended up with a much better start. but now that I'm going deeper into chemistry it's nice to have it


[26-Aug-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	True, I like it for the limestone which is one of the more pricy raws for construction. I can sell it now too, and all I need to buy is refined iron


[26-Aug-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	It's nice


[26-Aug-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	i first spawned on Prism which didn't have much and was too far from the exchange to sustain myself


[26-Aug-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	ye construction was my start, i make almost all of my own building materials


[26-Aug-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ghstnn**:	thats interesting, my first login rn. picked montem metall


[26-Aug-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Well, I'll probably be buying the wares you sell to the market ;)


[26-Aug-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Glad montem has a lot of activity, it's nice to have a chat with people on planet


[26-Aug-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ghstnn**:	how does travel work?


[26-Aug-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	yeah the planet i ended up colonizing is very profitable but the chat's like dead


[26-Aug-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	FTL travel is pretty similar to STL travel except it takes longer and uses a different fuel


[26-Aug-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I can imagine, I havn't made it that far ever yet but I'm excited to explore my options when I'm settled better


[26-Aug-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm absolutely overflowing with LST from XG-326a. but the price seems to have dropped a lot, it doesn't seem to translate into much profit. but I'll make plenty of NS with it


[26-Aug-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Truuuuue


[26-Aug-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	oh hey that's where i settled :3


[26-Aug-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ghstnn**:	do people trade currencies?


[26-Aug-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it's a good planet. I make my C there too


[26-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	takes a lot of liquid capital and a lot of time to make profit trading currencies


[26-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you can trade using the FX series of commands, I don't remember specifics though


[26-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I want to try farming at one point just for fun but man oh man


[26-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	i wouldn't be surprised if the heavy hitters like lowstrife do it


[26-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	farming is a great start because you can produce your own food and only have to worry about OVE


[26-Aug-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	i've been meaning to adjust my code to make a version geared towards finding the best farming planets


[26-Aug-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	i think you could do decent in the prunplanner search tho


[26-Aug-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	True! Unless you make cotton LOL


[26-Aug-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	just filter to planets with water and sort by fertility


[26-Aug-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I havn't used any plugins yet but I heard they're essential


[26-Aug-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	then manually vet out any that are more than 4 jumps or so from the nearest exchange


[26-Aug-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I do indeed make RCO, but I didn't for the longest time- it was more profit to buy the OVE

**EnemyCube**:	problem is, in this sector of space there aren't a ton of great fertile worlds, particular not close to MOR


[26-Aug-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	agriculture COGC is a nice bonus to narrow it down


[26-Aug-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	tyty


[26-Aug-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	my main ones are Verdant, Proxion, and Harmonia. not close


[26-Aug-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	Verdant (YI-715b) looks decent


[26-Aug-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it is indeed really good. that was where I started


[26-Aug-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I've got 3 permits there in fact


[26-Aug-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	only 5 jumps from NC1 with high water concentration and 108% fert


[26-Aug-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Holy shiet


[26-Aug-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	if you find it in prunplanner search and click the + on the left it'll let you plan a base on it


[26-Aug-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-24 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ghstnn**:	i finally managed to buy some mats..


[26-Aug-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Veterans of Montem, I need to hear your opinion on where one could settle from here. I currently have four prospect circuits:


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	1) Kiruna - Libertas circuit for Metallurgy and PP1s


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	2) Celebdil - QQ-082b - Danakil circuit for Aluminum and PP2s


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	3) Verdant - Sand circuit for food


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	4) Bastion system for metallurgy and food


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	After setting up at least some of these circuits, I plan to settle in OT-889 to colocate all my advanced production in one system


[29-Aug-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	What do you think?


[29-Aug-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	what do you currently do on Montem, primarily?


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Im a constructor, but I dont currently have anything as a "primary" industry - I do chemistry, construction, metallurgy, food - everything a little


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I dont want to focus on anything in particular, I'd like to develop a balanced set of industries, then focus on full-stack shipbuilding, starting with STL shuttles, they shouldn't be that expensive

***user69779d14d0** left.*


[29-Aug-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pfeifenson**:	Just focus on one industry. Otherwise u r loosing money. I know it’s hard in the beginning, but when you have 2 or 3 planets, u know what I’m talking about.


[29-Aug-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I'm kinda facing the same question myself. I'm thinking, like, try to make one industry your main output and the next planets to try to support that?


[29-Aug-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	That's where I'm leaning, at least

[29-Aug-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, focusing on one industry sounds appealing, efficiency-wise, but i wanna be about sustainbility


[29-Aug-24 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You are earning real money up untill ALO.NC1 prices double, for example - then you are barely making ends meet


[29-Aug-24 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Relating heavily on fluctuating market sounds like a bad idea


[29-Aug-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Also, this game has so many industries to explore - and limiting oneself to only one just for a 10% throughput boost sounds kinda lame


[29-Aug-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, I might be losing money - I'm here not to earn money, but to play a space economy tamagotchi, in all its beauty, preferably


[29-Aug-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Sorry for the rant


[29-Aug-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Play it how you wanna play it.


[29-Aug-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You can be efficient, you can be dumb, you can go all-in on one industry if you wanna :p


[29-Aug-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I just spread out into most of the basic industries and haven't moved much


[29-Aug-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I also wonder, when you are developed and specialized, how do you buy and sell stuff? Through CX, mostly? Or with recurring contracts with other players?


[29-Aug-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Really depends - sometimes you work stuff out with other people. Sometimes you just want it immediately and go to the CX.


[29-Aug-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So you dont really rely on like "suppliers" much?


[29-Aug-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It depends


[29-Aug-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I find that a good way to go about production is to make sure that most of your major expenses are covered in-house


[29-Aug-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It also depends on availability of certain products


[29-Aug-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You're most likely going to want to produce more niche materials yourself


[29-Aug-24 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It's all a balancing act, really


[29-Aug-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You go to far to one side and you're effectively playing the game in singleplayer mode


[29-Aug-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Too far to the other and you're jeopardizing your operations

[31-Aug-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	If you didn't have a warehouse at the market where you bought them then check your contracts with the conts command.  the market sends you a contract to deliver the goods if there is nowhere else for them to go

**AtomicScience**:	Hi, in this game you build a business empire with 'branches' on different planets


[06-Sep-24 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kittenbeard**:	Im so sad I forgot about this game because I had this massive fuel empire


[06-Sep-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	I had two full spreadsheets of logistics


[06-Sep-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	And I was making like 40,000 a day


[06-Sep-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	And it all got liquidated


[06-Sep-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, same. I had like 6 bases, and I just abandoned them all, because they felt like a chore


[06-Sep-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	But its fine :)


[06-Sep-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	because NOW we have a lil startup again


[06-Sep-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Check back every 30 hours when my carbon has been produced


[06-Sep-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Gonna resurrect your fuel empire? Or venture into some other industry this time?


[06-Sep-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Im in another industry - this time going with carbon production


[06-Sep-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Depending on how this goes I might liquidate and start back at fuel... Carbon doesn't seem to expand too specially imo


[06-Sep-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Why Montem then? Promitor would've been the best spawn for it, no?


[06-Sep-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Not a clue


[06-Sep-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	I think it was really far from the nearest trading


[06-Sep-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, I made the same mistake my very first run


[06-Sep-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	But Promitor has a CX in the system too


[06-Sep-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Montem has crap fertility, can't do much farming


[06-Sep-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Well I did just start up like a day ago


[06-Sep-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	We'll see how it fares


[06-Sep-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Any idea how long it would take to grow 2 recipes of 1 water to 4 grain on promitor?


[06-Sep-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	its hard to test the differences without just doing it


[06-Sep-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	It's gonna be like, much, much faster


[06-Sep-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	They have an Agriculture cogc, and ferility


[06-Sep-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	VH-331a


[06-Sep-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Also I had an issue with the recommended farms to incinerators - Two farms is always producing more than an incin can handle


[06-Sep-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, slap an FP and turn that excess harvest into food


[06-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Or run your incinerators on faster recipes


[06-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Fair enough - I can't say I'm well versed in PrUN at all


[06-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, here is my advice to you: COLIQ and start anew on Promitor, if you are so keen on being a carbon farmer


[06-Sep-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Staying would be a mistake


[06-Sep-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kittenbeard**:	Understandable - being so close to the start I might as well


[06-Sep-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDefender221**:	Question: How are items you buy at the exahnge stored if your ship hasn't arrived yet?


[07-Sep-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Do you need to pay a fee?


[07-Sep-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Do they just appear in your ship's inventory when it docks?


[07-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	If you have rented warehouse space at that CX, it's put there.


[07-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Otherwise, it will be put in a contract - check CONTS (or CONT on the sidebar on desktop)


[07-Sep-24 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	I see. Since I don't have a warehouse on the CX, its in the contract.


[07-Sep-24 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Is it ok for it to stay there for a while?


[07-Sep-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Is there some sort of consequence? For instance, its listed in the contract page but its actually still in the ship of the seller and they can get annoyed that I'm not picking it up and cancel?


[07-Sep-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	if you purchased something from the CX and you don't have a warehouse there it will stay in a kind of limbo state indefinitely - no penalty.

**space_trader**:	LST.NC1


[08-Sep-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Price is finally starting to rebound, eh?


[08-Sep-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I wonder why FEO.NC1 is like three times cheaper than LST.NC1


[08-Sep-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I mean, I didn't see any particularly rich FEO deposits on the map nearby, and even if there were some, shipping costs are gonna kill any profits - full cargo bay of FEO is gonna cost like, what, 3k?


[08-Sep-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	FEO.NC1 refines into FE.NC1, and right now the jump between FEO and FE on Moria is...a lot.


[08-Sep-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Also LST can directly be used in the manufacture of things that sell pretty well (FLX, MCG, NS) while FEO can only be refined


[08-Sep-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	So maybe that's part of it?


[08-Sep-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I just wonder what's the motivation of people who ship FEO to CX, they barely recoup fuel costs, especially if they ship from other systems


[08-Sep-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	they buying smthg on CX for ex and this is make possible to bring ship to CX, why not


[08-Sep-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That's still like 80 pieces of ore per haul


[08-Sep-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	FEO.NC1 costs should be on par with with ALO.NC1, unless I'm not seeing something


[08-Sep-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	why? ALO isnt extracting near MOR


[08-Sep-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Celebdil is kinda close


[08-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	wow, its not on par with Vallis or Montem))


[08-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	FEO is on a bunch of starting planets so maybe there's a lot more production of it?


[08-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Like Vallis and Montem, yeah


[08-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	(I don't actually know, I'm just tossing ideas out there)


[08-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Most offers on CX offer thousands of pieces per lot, not exactly newbie numbers


[08-Sep-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Huh


[08-Sep-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Actually looking at the chart long term it looks like FEO prices crashed


[08-Sep-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	that offers may to sit there for monthes


[08-Sep-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Usually it's averaging around the $60-$65 range


[08-Sep-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That's still petty cents


[08-Sep-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I mean, let's take a starter ship loaded with FEO, that's 5k when sold. To ship it from Vallis, for example, and get back, you'll have to burn like 1.5-2k worth of fuel


[08-Sep-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	5k is when ore costs their usual 60$


[08-Sep-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I mean, look around the map, almost all planets with FEO have Metallurgy COGC


[08-Sep-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Because shipping FEO barely makes any sense


[08-Sep-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I see this problem a little deeper - many newbies not staying here after dig expirience, and really smelting people is low count


[08-Sep-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Didn't quite get that


[08-Sep-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Sorry for my eng

**starWanderer**:	I mean, there are many newbies digging ore right here, of which only a few remain to be smelted


[08-Sep-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, I doubt Montem newbies mine FEO for cash - LST is much more appealing


[08-Sep-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	We have Vallis for))


[08-Sep-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	People who spawn on Vallis are Metallurgists, so they would be more inclined to scale their SMEs, instead of spamming EXTs, as you suggest


[08-Sep-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	\o/


[08-Sep-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Ok, I guess I'll go ask around the help chat


[08-Sep-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Yeah, I don't fully know why it's so cheap - it looks like it's crashed a bit from historical averages, but I get your point. I wish I had a better answer for you. D:

**TheDefender221**:	Carbon is so expensive, smelting FEO to sell FE is a rather small margin, even with the prices


[08-Sep-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	no. Im buying C and smelting FE


[08-Sep-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	and buying FEO and O sometime :)


[08-Sep-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	but I dont selling FE, making BFabs


[08-Sep-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Yes, that makes more money. Actually turning around and selling FE is the second worst margin of anything in my (limited) excel sheet. I dont have any vertical integration yet to make it more profitable


[08-Sep-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	For isntance, a smelter to smelt FEO in the first place.

**littleman27**:	Hello, I was in the middle of the tutorial when I went offline, Is there a way to bring it back?


[11-Sep-24 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Screen 1 should have the tutorial


[11-Sep-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**littleman27**:	I see the help panel on screen 1 but the guided instructions don't seem to be starting anymore hm...


[11-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**littleman27**:	I got up to the point where it taught me how to move resources from my ship to my base and the next step was going to be making the recommended starter buildings... and I figured I could pick up there when I came back lol


[11-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ixindamix**:	you should have all info in your contracts


[11-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	under "help" you click "Base Building"?


[11-Sep-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ixindamix**:	also with the TRA command you should get a buffer with tutorials


[11-Sep-24 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo981**:	its been a while but click on help near the top right of your screen and you should be able to scroll through the tutorials again


[11-Sep-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo981**:	if not there should be tutorials on the game's website somewhere


[11-Sep-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo981**:	sry just saw the first message


[11-Sep-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**littleman27**:	From the help panel I can access the wiki or open the related buffers... From the TRA I can access the videos but so far still not the same as the guided tutorial. Maybe I'll just have to endure it, oh well


[11-Sep-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ixindamix**:	yea i think you'll get it back when you complete the current contract (not sure if you can bring it up manually)


[11-Sep-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo981**:	tbh the best information is on the online tutorials anyways


[11-Sep-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**littleman27**:	Oh its waiting on the condition in the contract, I forgot about those... It says pending :D


[11-Sep-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**littleman27**:	No guided tutorial (maybe it ended?) but the contract is completed which created a new contract lol I guess that means I'm doing the right thing... but yeah I look at the website too thanks guys


[11-Sep-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	There's also video tutorials which helped me a lot and are immersive for the setting on the main start screen

**Barry_Beat**:	Guten Morgen, für was ist das Repräsentanzzentrum wichtig ?


[19-Sep-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stefan316**:	The APEX Representation Center allows companies and corporations to donate some of their profits to the APEX foundation. The foundation uses the money to supply new and upcoming CEOs with the necessary capital and ships to start their entrepreneurial journey. Having a high representation level is widely recognized as a testimony of wealth and success.

**boom_badda_boom**:	If I left from a station 5 mins back to travel down to a planet, but I cancelled the flight, why is my ship now stuck in orbit with a count down of 3h and 7m?


[26-Sep-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	when you cancel a flight, the ship needs to finish its current maneuver


[26-Sep-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So it will go back to the station, but after 3h?


[26-Sep-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	yep


[26-Sep-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Thats bad


[26-Sep-24 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	I don't think it'll go back to the station, I think it'll be left wherever it is at the end of this current leg of the journey


[26-Sep-24 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I just made my first 15000 off MCG for 526 units. With the beginner factories what is more profitable?


[26-Sep-24 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	heh. Yesterdey I was back my ship after departing and first jump. It was 8 hours))


[26-Sep-24 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	omg


[26-Sep-24 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	I highly suggest setting up and checking prun planner for profitability


[26-Sep-24 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	A lot of the recipes would produce a loss


[26-Sep-24 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	it's a base planner, more intuitive than spreadsheets


[26-Sep-24 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	set up FIO, you'll find the instructions in prun planner


[26-Sep-24 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Thanks, book marked for when my ship gets back


[26-Sep-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Steel looks profitable


[26-Sep-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Other than that


[26-Sep-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I would need to travel using that planner further I think


[26-Sep-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quetzalcoatl-III**:	the setup takes a bit of effort, but afterwards, it's incredibly easy to check what to build or what to make with your factories


[26-Sep-24 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Is there much to be made staying at the station buying low and selling high. I guess that can take a week or two


[26-Sep-24 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	pure trading on the market can be very tricky. If you are planning on just trading on the CX's, you need to be flying back and forth to the different ones, buying stuff here, selling there, etc


[26-Sep-24 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ah, thanks


[26-Sep-24 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	different systems have different prices for different things. You will need to be constantly checking


[26-Sep-24 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Also, check the local markets, because sometimes you can find really good deals there, but I think you need to have at least Basic to trade on the LM's


[26-Sep-24 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	And yes, Steel can be profitable, but you need an insane amount of O to do it, so be careful


[26-Sep-24 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ok


[26-Sep-24 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There are a few items that seem to always be going up in price


[26-Sep-24 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I could buy a load of that, leave it in my warehouse, and sell at a profit


[26-Sep-24 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Or, you can make steel, and turn it into Power Tools, which is also profitable


[26-Sep-24 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	The problem is, that you are better off investing that money into some production than keeping it in your warehouse


[26-Sep-24 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Or doing something with it while its not in use


[26-Sep-24 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	^^^


[26-Sep-24 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Just need to make sure as best I can if I buy and sell at higher price, there are high chances it will go up


[26-Sep-24 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	people with a lot of money can play that long game. When you are new, you need to keep rolling it over as fast as you can


[26-Sep-24 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Also, this game does have some inflation, so you can actually lose money, even if the number on your account is gonna be bigger


[26-Sep-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	ROIs are insane in this game, so producing stuff is always much more profitable than any sort of trading


[26-Sep-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and I've seen markets crash hard, so you can lose your shirt if you are not careful


[26-Sep-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	lol


[26-Sep-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	why is it taking so long to fill my orders -_-


[26-Sep-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	because they are too expensive/cheap


[26-Sep-24 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, some things you might wait weeks for someone to pay your price


[26-Sep-24 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	i payed the market prive T-T


[26-Sep-24 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	price


[26-Sep-24 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	High Volume trading with continuous price increases, or large dips and peaks buying at the dips and selling on the peaks


[26-Sep-24 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its on steam now, so new players, they gonna be wanting BSE soon, I think the price will go up on that


[26-Sep-24 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	@TheBoredMan What item is it?


[26-Sep-24 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	im waiting on 20 DW, 6 BSE, and 20 FE


[26-Sep-24 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Check the order book, your order should be the closest to the spread, then it's gonna get filled quite fast


[26-Sep-24 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	You're still better off just making the BSE, instead of buying it on the market, and hoping the price goes up


[26-Sep-24 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	can't make anything rn


[26-Sep-24 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	don't got the stuff


[26-Sep-24 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	i need the BSE to build a smelter


[26-Sep-24 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	are you free, basic, or Pro?


[26-Sep-24 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I cannot make BSE yet, day 3 for me


[26-Sep-24 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	free


[26-Sep-24 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	For FE, there are (big) and better buy requests than yours right now, you'll need to up your price or wait a long time


[26-Sep-24 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, free is hard. You can only trade at the CX


[26-Sep-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	yep


[26-Sep-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	For BSE too, actually. You created a 6 BSE order at the same price as a huge order (2000 items) so yours won't complete before the huge one is filled


[26-Sep-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	If you had Pro, you can throw up an ad for those things, for cheap, and I could help you


[26-Sep-24 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	Im waiting for someone to full fill my orders at Moria Station


[26-Sep-24 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	If you really need something, you might have to just pay the price to insta-buy it


[26-Sep-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There are quite literally 29 BSE on sale, and price is very high


[26-Sep-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you have 2192 orders in front of you for BSE. You will never see it


[26-Sep-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Demand for about 6000 lol

**TheBoredMan**:	i paid 1,600 for the BSE


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no, you put up a bid to buy it at 1600


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	dam it


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Sell it back at 3000


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	haven't got it yet


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	can't sell


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	cancle your bid, and just spend the extra 50 and buy them


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	He cancelled it lol


[26-Sep-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I saw it vanish


[26-Sep-24 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	1600 is the MM. You cannot sell for that price or higher


[26-Sep-24 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So with virtually no BSE people are going to be stuck making MCG, so I gonna buy up the silicon


[26-Sep-24 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	the MM is limitless, so it will always be available at that price


[26-Sep-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Selling BSE for 1600 each is a really good price. I would be making BSE, and just selling it to those people


[26-Sep-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	finally


[26-Sep-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Yeah I make LST on site and just buy the FE, it's a wonderful profit


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I make iron on Sabaton, 1 jump away. I make so much, I'm littereally drowning in it


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	it is


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Is there a planet with gold on?


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yes


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	If you go to the travel screen, you can sort by resource


[26-Sep-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	look for them in FIO


[26-Sep-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	According to that my planet has gold on


[26-Sep-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its not listed though


[26-Sep-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Ah wait, reading it wrong


[26-Sep-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	You can use https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch , search for AUO (and sort by closest to Moria)


[26-Sep-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	3 systems away


[26-Sep-24 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, but very expensive to settle on


[26-Sep-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and there is a very limited use for gold, so not really worth it


[26-Sep-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Where`s the piracy, I could have taken someone elses


[26-Sep-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you can accept shipping contracts, and just take the freight


[26-Sep-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	ok, i got my stuff and sent my ship home lol


[26-Sep-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	but you will be blacklisted in maybe 2 days, by everyone


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	why


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	why what?


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Thats the closet to piracy?


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	He was referencing the piracy thing Bored not you


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Steel other peoples stock pretending to do a contact for them


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, this is a non-combat game


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I mean if you want PvP econ just get into EvE or somethin LOL


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	How do people know if someone is blacklisted?


[26-Sep-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	People talk, and the community is small


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	ish


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Piracy here we come!


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheBoredMan**:	...


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, pirates get talked about everywhere, and everyone will blacklist you fast


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And I cannot rename my company afterwards?


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Best of luck, I'll make sure not grant you a contract in the future LOL


[26-Sep-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no one will accept any kind of contract with you, so you are basically cutting your own throat


[26-Sep-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no


[26-Sep-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Dam best not then


[26-Sep-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you will need to COLIQ and start from scratch


[26-Sep-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Even those this kind fella wants to give me free 500 fuel


[26-Sep-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Yeah not the game for PvP type stuff, this is a more chilled econ experience. :)


[26-Sep-24 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Another one here wants to give me 10 BSE lol


[26-Sep-24 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Thats 26500 once sold


[26-Sep-24 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So tempting


[26-Sep-24 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I would use it to build something, like a PP1, so you can make your own


[26-Sep-24 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and 10 BSE will get you 16000, not 26.5


[26-Sep-24 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	price is at 1650 not 2650?


[26-Sep-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no, price is 1600, that you can sell at.


[26-Sep-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	You can never sell for 1650


[26-Sep-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If I accept the 10 BSE order and delivery it, is there an award?


[26-Sep-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you get paid for shipping


[26-Sep-24 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Ok lets try the right way first before thinking about mugging


[26-Sep-24 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Shipping is really big for you new guys. You can make a bunch of money


[26-Sep-24 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ah, thanks, gonna try it


[26-Sep-24 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and they have impemented NPC contracts, to help you new guys out, and you will get bonuses as your influence goes up


[26-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Yeah I've done the NPC contracts everyday, they're very lucrative.


[26-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Especially when it comes with free rations or fuel :)


[26-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I don't think I've paid for fuel once yet with what the contracts give me. Though I'm due for a top up soon


[26-Sep-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Oh no, I spent the BSE


[26-Sep-24 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It was an accident


[26-Sep-24 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	joke lol


[26-Sep-24 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	bruh lmao


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you lose faction ratings


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its already on U


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Theres only 3 letters below that


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	they better your faction rating, the better the contract that you can get, and the more money you make


[26-Sep-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ah


[26-Sep-24 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So delivery NPC contracts, and maybe only steal the occassional one?


[26-Sep-24 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	If you want to cut your own nose off, thats up to you


[26-Sep-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Not sure how much of a rating hit you will take if you steal one. It might drop you down to Zero again


[26-Sep-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	omg


[26-Sep-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	or they might just never give you another


[26-Sep-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I best do the stealing first lol


[26-Sep-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	this isn't a theft game. Those that try to make it into one don't last long


[26-Sep-24 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If someone ever wants me to ship 1000 units of something costing a few grand, of course I`m going to piracy that


[26-Sep-24 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, you're not going to last long here. Nice knowing ya!


[26-Sep-24 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	lmao


[26-Sep-24 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Save it for Elite, I`m the worst pirate going on that


[26-Sep-24 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	30 mill from robbery is funny


[26-Sep-24 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I've sold a couple things on the CX, and made 200,000. Stealing a shipment from someone to grab a couple grand, and getting banned by the entire community is just stupid


[26-Sep-24 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, this isn't Elite


[26-Sep-24 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The begging and pleading from players with a full hull of something expensive brings a tear to my eye.


[26-Sep-24 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So I make myself feel better by shooting them and taking it lol

[26-Sep-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Just in case the new players don't know about it - you can click on a player and in the pop-up you will see 3 yellow boxes.  One of those is "Block User".  if you press that then the User is restricted from accepting any of your LM ads.  Sometimes it seems like players believe the blacklist is a word of mouth thing and you have to check every LM contract manually.  Just block the pirates.


[26-Sep-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Agreed. I have blocked that player above


[26-Sep-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I just arrived at a station with various stock to complete a contract. This is the first one I have intentionally completed. The thing is in the contract list it shows as fulfilled but hasnt deducted the inventory. I still have it. Is that normal?


[26-Sep-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no idea, I never really did them

**Taco0o**:	How do i get more Basic Construction Materials to build buildings?


[27-Sep-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	BSE*


[27-Sep-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Most direct way is to buy them from the CX


[27-Sep-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	With basic/pro you can purchase off of contracts on the LM as  well, if that's available.


[27-Sep-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	Im on a free account and used my Starting BSE for the wrong building and have non to construct the building i need too. Not sure what CX or LM is. Sorry could u explain a little more?


[27-Sep-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	CX as in Moria Station Commodity Exchange? Cause i flew my ship here and do not see anything in any of the tabs in the market to purchase bse

[27-Sep-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	LM is the local market, but if you are free to play you can't use it.  The APEX UI should've started you with a trading screen but if you don't have that open a new buffer and type CX NC1


[27-Sep-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	mat bse in another window will show you that BSE are Construction Prefabs, that should help you to find them in the CX.  I believe if you deconstruct a building quickly after constructing it you get all of your materials back as well.


[27-Sep-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Taco0o** deleted this message.*


[27-Sep-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	Just saw these messages. I'm glad Aahz was able to help you. n.n


[27-Sep-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	Thank you as well Cyrup!


[27-Sep-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	I have another question. On the trading screen I have a chart module but am unable on how to change the commodity it is currently displaying


[27-Sep-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	try adjusting the intra-day numbers at the top,  the first set of selections is how far back to go and the second is the frequency of data points, so 90d and then 1d means show the last 90 days of trades and give 1 data point per day.


[27-Sep-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	some items aren't traded a ton so depending what titem you are looking at there may be no trades in the last day for instance.


[27-Sep-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	I was more so trying to change the commodity it is charting. I didnt see anything to change it from what it currently is showing which is Rations.


[27-Sep-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	Thank you for your help


[27-Sep-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taco0o**:	Nvm I figured it out thank you tho


[28-Sep-24 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	also, there are buttons on the left side of the screen to pull up other windows, like the CX's, your COMmunications, INVentories, etc.

[02-Oct-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Would be convenient for me too but not anyone else that has to build anything


[02-Oct-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	How about changing the recipe to produce more than 1 unit?


[02-Oct-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Prices of metals would probably go up as people have more profit from construction and need more


[02-Oct-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I mean, you can make more than one in a go it just increases the time


[02-Oct-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Chapsie**:	Which is how the economy flourishes, people need to construct infrastructure, maintain large bases, and produce items. If it was easier, prices would go down, and the economy would be slower as it'd be easier to be self sustaining.


[02-Oct-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	10 days in - 2 BMPs and 2 Prefabs


[02-Oct-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	True, I got 2 prefab mk1 and 2 mk2's with 2 extractors for lst and 2 BMP's for granulate. It feels good


[02-Oct-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Been too focused on growth and hardly export anything other than to sustain my growth LOL


[02-Oct-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Didnt bother with food and carbon?


[02-Oct-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Me? No, I just buy it. It's a waste of time for my plan to specialize


[02-Oct-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	But I completely understand wanting to be self sustaining.


[02-Oct-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I`m making powertools with the BMPs for money, and Prefabs for expansion as fast as possible


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Yeah that's fair. I find MCG is well worth it considering the cheap materials and it outputs 50 each run


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	powertools make more profit on my planet


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	MCG price is collapsing


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Though I do make exo suits occasionally.


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	We on the montem channel, we're on the same planet :P


[02-Oct-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	PT worth more


[02-Oct-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	21 about 15k profit, thats 3 production cycles


[02-Oct-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Even more if you make the PE


[02-Oct-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Ah wait thats for BTAs etc


[02-Oct-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I mean fair, I find it easier since I make so much LST so it's basically free resource besides worker upkeep and SIO which is super cheap to buy.


[02-Oct-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I also use it to build so it's a dual use LOL


[02-Oct-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	BBH been going up the last 30 days though on average


[02-Oct-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	2 facs on MCG, assuming you never leave 2 BMPs dormant, 286 days to make a million


[02-Oct-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Not counting price fluctuations


[02-Oct-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	MCG price going down


[02-Oct-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And not counting other things like food and clothing and water


[02-Oct-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I understand, it's just simpler for me personally to produce it, use it to build, and export excess basically.


[02-Oct-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	It comes up in contracts often too for me


[02-Oct-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Those contracts keep wanting my powertools and prefabs


[02-Oct-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Yeah it's often based on things you make so I think that makes sense.


[02-Oct-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	As far as I can tell, they can be worth it sometimes. No fuel cost, premium immediate pay, and sometimes you get some other resources.


[02-Oct-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	Not always worth though

**TheDefender221**:	hmmm. After some expansion I have come to the conclusion that I'd need at least 3 "Rig"s to get enough water to turn to drinking water for my employees. Sheesh


[05-Oct-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	is that what everyone does? How is drinking water not stupid expensive?


[05-Oct-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	well, for one you shouldn't be doing that here. this planet isn't ideal for that kind of setup


[05-Oct-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	if you want to do food production, you should switch to Promitor or Verdant or somewhere with better water


[05-Oct-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	DW is also at a pretty high price point currently


[05-Oct-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm actually of the belief that Montem isn't a great starting planet unless you can get support to bootstrap a better base. certainly trying to produce your own DW here will slow you down more than it's worth


[05-Oct-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	I was just building up vertical integration, and farming is actually useful enough that I want to make 2 farms and 2 processors.


[05-Oct-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	so, having one rig to get some amount of water is useful


[05-Oct-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	rather, where can I find that information?


[05-Oct-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	BS > *planet* > Workforce


[05-Oct-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	I meant "per pioneer" rather than the total. I know I can do a Total Consumed per day / Total Poineers  , but theres no guarantee the equasion is that simple. There could be, for instance, the first 50 people are "free", or every 100 people increases the amount of consumable each person uses slightly


[05-Oct-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	sorry, bro, I dont calculate it


[05-Oct-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	its fine. I'll just look across wikis and such


[05-Oct-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	Ok. so for pioneers its 0.04 DW per day or 4 DW for 100 pioneers per day. It is strictly linear.


[05-Oct-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	since the amount of water a person has per day is 3L for women and 4L for men, it implies that 0.01DW is 1L, or 1 DW is 100L of water

[31-Oct-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	how come? is the game losing players?


[31-Oct-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	I think inactive players are being removed automatically


[31-Oct-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	They seem to be coming in surges, and are removed automatically after 30 or 60 days, if I'm not mistaken


[31-Oct-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	So, this +12 surplus can theoretically be gone overnight


[31-Oct-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	theoretically

**xa2023xa**:	Never go to station if ship is not 80% full or the flight is longer than 8 hours. or you use the flight time as intervall your next online session.


[05-Nov-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	That only works if you're self-sufficient enough and have enough money to buy a weeks worth of supplies. I'm getting there, but am not quite


[05-Nov-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	At early stages, you are better off reinvesting any free penny back into your production. When you are just starting out, you can supply your only base no problem


[05-Nov-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDefender221**:	When you are literally just starting, yes. But at that point you cant fill a ship at 80% and have your supplies last long enough to build up that kind of output to sell.

[21-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, hello again! :D


[21-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It is an option, but I am not sure if it is more profitable that way


[21-Nov-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	You may end up with more profit just buying O and using the resources for an extra SME instead


[21-Nov-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	Hi again lol.


[21-Nov-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	Yeah, it looks like O is pretty cheap


[21-Nov-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yup


[21-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Limestone is a bit more expensive, so you can extract that – for selling it, or to use in a PP1 for BSE/BDE


[21-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	sorry, BBH*


[21-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	at least being in the same system as Moria station means I won't need to use FF for a while


[21-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That is also true


[21-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And less SF, tbh


[21-Nov-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	I'm looking at the system map, and there's a long line of ships from here to the station. Why are they taking a circular path? Wouldn't it be faster to just go in a straight line instead of using a Hohman transfer like they are in the map?


[21-Nov-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, ships travel in orbits, and those are elliptic


[21-Nov-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	true... you'd think with a travel time of 5 hours, it'd be a more direct route


[21-Nov-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	One cannot just fly in a straight line with a star hanging around :D


[21-Nov-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**F3uertrunk3n**:	If you go fast enough, you could. But it's much more efficient to go in an orbit.


[21-Nov-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Not just fast, you need to compensate for gravity (or go straight down)

[21-Nov-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	there's also the initial velocity to take into account. you can't immediately cancel it when starting, so even if the star's gravitation didn't apply to the ship, the ship would take a similar trajectory

[03-Dec-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	I`ve found a bug


[06-Dec-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I have just purchased 2 x 100 iron ore (1st time I thought I had just made a mistake) and none of it made it into my station warehouse unit

**boom_badda_boom**:	Money deducted for both, no stock in warehouse


[06-Dec-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bill090**:	finally learned about box plots in my statistics class, now i can be even better at this game


[07-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	too bad it doesn't actually use box plots


[07-Dec-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	they look similar, but show different things. in statistics, box plots show separately the median (middle bar) + first/last quartile (the box) + min/max excluding outliers (whiskers). This game's charts show the opening/closing prices (the box) and the min/max (whiskers)

[13-Dec-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	FLX prices on all four  CX's are inflated - 1 LST yields 10 FLX - the stuff should be much cheaper.....and what does the price of CL  have to do with it (other than you would shift your production to HAL->CL).


[13-Dec-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Precisely


[13-Dec-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Dec-24 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It's also important why do you want to join a corp. Some of them are very focused, some are chill and lazy, some have internal markets, some are space communists, some are operating in this region, and some are not


[23-Dec-24 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	What is cool tho is that you have plenty to choose from


[23-Dec-24 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and some you won't find on the Discord (we're still too chill and lazy)...but if your plan includes an expansion to Verdant, we're the place to be.

[24-Dec-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Dec-24 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-24 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	problem with ship parts is its a very niche market - most players use shipbuilders to upgrade/buy ships rather than the open market, and most shipbuilders source from their own production.


[29-Dec-24 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MapReduce**:	keep in mind that prices you see are higher than people are willing to pay for


[29-Dec-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	(otherwise, someone would have already bought it)


[29-Dec-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	x5 then, making the ship parts would set me up for a month of solid expansion

**--SCHAITR--**:	Good luck trying to secure the LIS...


[29-Dec-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yikes


[29-Dec-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	tcu could be sold to larger planets that are expanding hospital or emergency center POPI infrastructure, so there is at least an alternative market


[29-Dec-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and considering it was a gift, it's essentially free money at whatever price you can get


[29-Dec-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Mmm


[29-Dec-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	rather than going down the very expensive rabbit hole you're presently exploring


[29-Dec-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	CQT dont need LIS


[29-Dec-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The other 3 do though, and making LIS looks complex


[29-Dec-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Check out the almost non-existent volumes before you go into CQxs


[29-Dec-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not a large market for CQTiny (I think - not certain)


[29-Dec-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	TCU doesnt look that profitable


[29-Dec-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	relatively speaking


[29-Dec-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	how many are we talking about?


[29-Dec-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	12


[29-Dec-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so liquidated on the open market at bids you're talking 500k free money


[29-Dec-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or millions in investment to build the infrastructure to go down the rabbit hole


[29-Dec-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Bidding price is 90k


[29-Dec-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Asking is 190k


[29-Dec-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes, but demand numbers are critical - you'd have to ship some around to various markets


[29-Dec-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	at MOR, you could immediately sell 3 for a total of 240k


[29-Dec-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Such a loss


[29-Dec-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it cost you 0


[29-Dec-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or maybe 1


[29-Dec-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If I turn 4 into CQT tthats 400k immediate profit


[29-Dec-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but do you have the capability to do that, an APF and trhe workforce it requires?


[29-Dec-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Why is there a LIS shortage


[29-Dec-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Is it just rarely made?


[29-Dec-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I have a UPF


[29-Dec-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the shipbuilders produce their own stuff


[29-Dec-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	LIS is only made for crew quarters and sometimes HQ upgrades and stuff.


[29-Dec-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Making it looks like a nightmare costing millions in setup costs


[29-Dec-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	it does


[29-Dec-24 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	It seems pretty difficult to convert your TCU into cash


[29-Dec-24 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	other than thet few bids that exist on the open market....


[29-Dec-24 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	markets


[29-Dec-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I bet if I put them on the market right now, one of yous with LIS production would just snap them up haha


[29-Dec-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	eh, I make my own TCU, and my UPF are sitting empty sometimes - making TCU isn't something that I need to outsource


[29-Dec-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	5 for 400k @ant, 3 for 240k@mor - 640k readily available cash


[29-Dec-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	LEAD -> LIS, and reach out to the top producers


[29-Dec-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[29-Dec-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or sell it back to your secret santa


[29-Dec-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	all 16 of them


[29-Dec-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	which is proly what they had in mind


[29-Dec-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	12


[29-Dec-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	16 LIS producers


[29-Dec-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	They didnt start off as TCU they started off as ADR


[29-Dec-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	oh you were given ADR


[29-Dec-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	turning them into TCU was a mistake


[29-Dec-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	ADR has a market maker you could sell them to


[29-Dec-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	TCU is twice the price


[29-Dec-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	but noone buys it


[29-Dec-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	much more depth in the adr market


[29-Dec-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	and it costs a lot to make TCU - not only do you pay for the ADR, you pay for the plastic sheets


[29-Dec-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Poly and 3D printer is okay, I dismantled them now


[29-Dec-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	and you can't even sell it off fast


[29-Dec-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	and you had to invest into making a bunch of buildings that you are getting rid of


[29-Dec-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Got rid of


[29-Dec-24 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	They werent up for long, got most of my fabs back


[29-Dec-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	you always lose 1 of each


[29-Dec-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I think the next time you lose more prefabs is like 45 days in


[29-Dec-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So you say stop turning them into TCU


[29-Dec-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	yea


[29-Dec-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	the ADR is much easier to sell - unless you are able to source some LIS


[29-Dec-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	turns out noone really wants TCU - you want either ADR to sell to the market maker or crew quarters


[29-Dec-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	and CQT is not something most people want - most people want CQS or CQM


[29-Dec-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	LIS looks like I`d be waiting a year to grab just a  few


[29-Dec-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	you'd want to be much bigger to be able to make LIS. Is there a shipbuilder in LMAO?


[29-Dec-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I think I've invested close to 15-20mil into my shipbuilding, and I've yet to sell anything.


[29-Dec-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There is ship building going on yes, players working together to make parts on the cheap, I dont know if one of them makes LIS, this is the first I know of it


[29-Dec-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	*yet to finish making a ship


[29-Dec-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's too late now I guess, but you could have asked the community what to do with your gift before turning them into TCUs. Perhaps a lesson for the future


[29-Dec-24 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Oh well


[29-Dec-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	still options - 640k available on the markets for 8 tcu....lots of adr cash available for any you've not yet converted....or hold them long term if you plan to go the shipbuildin route


[29-Dec-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	in any case, it was a gift, so any option is net positive


[29-Dec-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	I have so little fuel in my ship it will take me 3 days to go from Montem to moria, please help me

[08-Jan-25 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**-butterfly-**:	I wrote into the help channel


[08-Jan-25 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I knew the POPR is a mixed report, some of it pre-cycle, some of the data after.....but even so, your open jobs should show up (plus more folks should have the same issue). Looks like they've got 2 PF3's up for vote, so will run those this week and next. Should fix the issue

**--SCHAITR--**:	5.7% unemployment is BEFORE the loss of 400+ ENGs


[09-Jan-25 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	Apologies, missed running PF3 this week so unfortunately we lost a chunk of pop in the last POPR. PIO/SET/TEC are OK with the unemployment reserve. ENG should bounce back within a week or two, SCI may take a little longer.

[15-Jan-25 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Hi, I'm afraid you cannot speed the production up, if all of your workforce needs are met


[15-Jan-25 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	In this game, everything takes hours, so get used to that


[15-Jan-25 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	This is actually less of a game, and more of a tamagotchi - you check in from time to time to queue new orders and send ships


[15-Jan-25 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Ways to increase production speed:


[15-Jan-25 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	1) Provide all workforce inputs, ncluding luxuries.


[15-Jan-25 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	2) Earn experts over time.


[15-Jan-25 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	3) Ensure buildings are in good repair (won't be an issue for you for a long time).


[15-Jan-25 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	4) Build your base to align with the planet's Chamber of Global Commerce program, if it has one.


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Here, the program gives a 25% speed bonus to chemistry.


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	5) Faction bonuses


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Oh, thanks, faction too.


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I tend to ignore that one, but it definitely counts!


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	But even with all these factors aligned in your favor, you will get like 160% efficiency


[15-Jan-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	AtomicScience is right, though.  It's a slow game.


[15-Jan-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's something to check in on once or twice a day or so.


[15-Jan-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDerpWolf**:	oh ok thanks guys!


[15-Jan-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Or to stare at madly all day, increasingly absorbed.


[15-Jan-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	The game is gonna be really slow at the start, but when you get more bases in the future, it will be more and more involving


[15-Jan-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	^ Exactly.


[15-Jan-25 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Slow start.  Use the time to get your bearings, and feel free to ask questions.  People in this game love giving tips.  Some of them even know what they're talking about.


[15-Jan-25 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You can take your time and save for business expansion yourself, or, if you feel confident, you can expedite the process but taking out a loan from other players


[15-Jan-25 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	A loan if you've bought pro.


[15-Jan-25 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Consider this stage the free demo.


[15-Jan-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, it's also worth noting that you will have to buy Pro at some point, or you will hit the ceiling of maximum HQ level


[15-Jan-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	If you play your cards right, it will happen in a couple of months, so plenty of time to decide


[15-Jan-25 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You don't *have* to.  Some heroic players have built pretty big companies on the free license.  There will be a hard permit limit without pro though.


[15-Jan-25 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Martin and Michi sure would appreciate the money though.  :)

**tempus_ego**:	oi so should i buy the LST and FE i need or should i just produce that by using extractor ? which is more productive in your opinion


[24-Jan-25 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	On Montem?  Extracting the LST is pretty erffective, but buy the FE.  Remember you'd have to not extract FEO, but also build a smelter and smelt the FEO to FE.


[24-Jan-25 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chapsie**:	I personally buy FE when I used it and extract LST because it's way too heavy to haul in meaningful quantities with the base ships

[30-Jan-25 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there's no way to guarantee transfer of goods unimpeded through the cx, and unlicensed you can't accept or receive contracts, so even if you pull it off, you could only go cx to cx.

[02-Feb-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	pro 1 month, then it lapses to basic, on basic you cannot send but you can accept contracts


[02-Feb-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Swonson**:	Hey, new player here: Where do I see the amount of RAT that my Pioneers need?


[18-Feb-25 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	click on "workforce" in your BS buffer


[18-Feb-25 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	I might be wrong but, don't I only see the amount of pioneers there? I had 120 required / 200 available / 200 capacity... or am I in the wrong cmd?


[18-Feb-25 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	sorry for asking stupid questions...


[18-Feb-25 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	above that, you have a row with a bunch of yellow buttons. one of them is labeled "workforce"


[18-Feb-25 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	ahh now I see. Thank you :)


[18-Feb-25 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	by the way, the "luxury consumables" (COF and PWO) are optional, but highly recommended if you can afford them. they are almost always profitable


[18-Feb-25 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	Thanks for the tip. I assume, those luxury consumables increase the happiness of my pioneers? If so, does an increased happiness mean a better productivity and faster production or something like that?


[18-Feb-25 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	correct


[18-Feb-25 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	great.


[18-Feb-25 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you can see it from the "satisfaction" in the workforce buffer, and the "efficiency factors" when creating a new order


[18-Feb-25 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	exact formulae are here: https://pct.fnar.net/workforce/index.html

https://pct.fnar.net/workforce/index.html
Workforce - PrUn Community Derived Information
Efficiency Formulas In every case, any value in brackets (e.g. [DW]) is the percentage fulfilled to your workforce. In most cases, this value is simply 1.0.
Pioneer Pioneer Efficiency = 0.02 * (1+([DW]*10/3)) * (1+([RAT]*4)) * (1+([OVE]*5/6)) * (1+([PWO]*1/11)) * (1+([COF]*2/13))
Settler Settler Efficiency = 0.01 * (1+([DW]*10/3)) * (1+([RAT]*4)...


[18-Feb-25 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	good to know. Do we have some kind of notepad in apex?


[18-Feb-25 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you can open a chat with yourself


[18-Feb-25 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	there are also browser extensions like https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refined-prun/ that add a lot of features, including a notepad

[18-Feb-25 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	nice. Thanks


[18-Feb-25 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	another question: I placed an order to buy PWO and COF without selecting a rented storage. How can I edit or remove my order? Or is it not necessary to select a storage?


[18-Feb-25 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can view/edit/remove your order at CXOS, but you don't have to select storage, if you don't have a warehouse or ship at the cx, your completed purchase will appear in CONTS


[18-Feb-25 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laerdros**:	The command CXOS shows orders and offers delete.


[18-Feb-25 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	Thank you


[18-Feb-25 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laerdros**:	Even if you specify your ship, if warehouse space is sufficient I think it defaults to the warehouse.


[18-Feb-25 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swonson**:	Unfortunately I didn't even had my ship at the exchange... I just realised I have to sent it there


[18-Feb-25 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	storage selection in buy order does not matter, it always ends up in the station warehouse (or CONTS), even if you select a ship

[19-Feb-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	the one edge case there is if you don't have a warehouse or the warehouse is full it will go to your ship before it goes to conts if there is a ship available


[19-Feb-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	so it's warehouse>ship>cont in terms of priority


[19-Feb-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and warehouses, notably, cannot be accessed by base production


[19-Feb-25 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	so you can have everything you need to make something on planet, in a warehouse, but it won't use it until you put it into base storage


[19-Feb-25 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	that one gets people fairly often their first time around

[03-Mar-25 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's just weird.  I think it calculates the route again each time, and it doesn't always allocate fuel among the different legs the same way.


[03-Mar-25 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Once you have a bit of money, stock them up so they only need a refill every few days


[03-Mar-25 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	When you later get bigger boats, stock them up for a month


[03-Mar-25 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	ahh ok yeah  good idea


[03-Mar-25 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	What did the tutorial have you build when you started


[03-Mar-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	the tutorial considers Montem a construction planet


[03-Mar-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	long time ago it was a construction planet then changed to chemistry


[03-Mar-25 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	how can you tell your Habitation number of pioneers in it ? and how do you know how many Extractor can you build ? figured it had number of employees working it

[04-Mar-25 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	loosing more then making selling lime and iron so this is a bust I see what reviews are saying now. New players cant sell nothing because large corp to self self sufficient. no reason buy cheap stuff


[04-Mar-25 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	There is no AI buying up commodities.


[04-Mar-25 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	The iron and limestone deposits here are good, so I'm not sure how you're losing money, but you are in the unfortunate position of not being aligned with the planetary chamber of commerce bonus, which is for chemistry, not extraction.


[04-Mar-25 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If there's a slump in those products right now, that's rough, but there are other starts for products with strong sellers' markets right now.


[04-Mar-25 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Starting as a farmer on Promitor, for example, is a really reliable way to get your feet under you.


[04-Mar-25 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	@Wulvgar why are you making metallurgy at a chemical planet? the GOGC gives 25% bonus efficiency and you arent getting it.


[04-Mar-25 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Honestly, I'm not sure how you're losing money on limestone though.  1,700 units were traded on Moria Station today alone, and prices are higher than they've been historically.  We're coming down from a spike in the price, but it's still above where it was a season ago.


[04-Mar-25 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Lot of people here are eager to offer advice, and I wouldn't say that it's game over.


[04-Mar-25 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhoopAss_McGue**:	Yeah I'm set up for construction thanks to the tutorial lol. Considering coliq and going Promitor but it would be a few months here wasted :(


[04-Mar-25 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	wanted keep things real simple at first build up money over time


[05-Mar-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	make 5k selling highest current market price then spend it all on the basic stuff needed to keep workforce 100% . so making no money. make more just buying selling the market and let workforce die lol


[05-Mar-25 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	multiple strategies, income streams - diversification - is key to any successful business venture


[05-Mar-25 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	do the work and you will find ways to make money


[05-Mar-25 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	make sure you take advantage of all bonuses tho


[05-Mar-25 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	hehe you mean run out of money , start over, try again. This is why player counts keep dropping to all time low. A simple npc ai investing small amounts into basic goods to help new players would help


[05-Mar-25 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	going keep loosing new players  and your numbers keep shrinking until it closes


[05-Mar-25 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	you picked a chem planet, that means 0 bonus from faction. you also selected to make metallurgy on a chem planet


[05-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	yep  I understand that, but shame the new players cant produce simple things like limestone to feed you bigger corps


[05-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	0 bonuses


[05-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	hmm so picking higest limestone isnt the key to limestone ?

**Wulvgar**:	wish game do better at helping where to start


[05-Mar-25 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	the mistake the game did was to let you start a base on montem


[05-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	most ppl start random i did too


[05-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	check the GOGC


[05-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	with the permit bonus from 1 planet thats another 15%


[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's an efficiency modifier


[05-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	you dont get either of them


[05-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wulvgar**:	ok so look for Advertising campaign limestone or ore ?


[05-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-25 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	depends what you plan to do with that LST....if you want to maximize extraction, then Res Ext cogc....like OZ-189a....or if you want the focus to be converting the LST into something else, construction or chemistry

[05-Mar-25 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	yeah i stopped trying to follow the market, people are selling for really low profit


[05-Mar-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	With current prices they are barely worth making, not after luxuries


[05-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Or maybe I need to ship them elsewhere, yes thats what I`ll do


[05-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Hortus


[05-Mar-25 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ABH on hortus looks good

**bobnobrain**:	Bro, it sells there like 10/week


[05-Mar-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Hortus is just a small market of home-grown veggies


[05-Mar-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	One like you can find near local farm where a family have been growing stuff since the great plague or something


[05-Mar-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It is a food/agri market, and that's it


[05-Mar-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I mean you can still try, but don't expect a quick sale


[05-Mar-25 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-25 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Vyrx**:	and to be honest it's not TERRIBLE to make fabs here if you're new since the raws are here and you can use the output. this is a game for people obsessed with optimization so take all commentary with a grain of salt


[12-Mar-25 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, being out of compliance with the CoGC on your first base isn't the end of the world.  You are missing out on a 25% bonus, but Montem has everything you need to get started with PP1s, so it's a simple way to learn to play.


[12-Mar-25 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can retool it later when you have money and want to chase efficiency (which you should).


[12-Mar-25 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	There was someone recently who asked molp to manually liquidate them since they had done so too recently.  If you definitely want to restart on Promitor (my home, and we would love to have you), you could see about asking him.


[13-Mar-25 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindly_Enclying_Trading**:	TBH what you are saying is my plan atm.  My other base is also on Promitor and prefabs are rather difficult at Hortus -- they often run dry there.


[13-Mar-25 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Mar-25 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	If you chase min-max efficiency right from hour 0 you're bound to overwhelm yourself and burn out quickly. Almost everything is profitable in this game. Just focus on making a bit of money and expanding, then optimise later

**Kindly_Enclying_Trading**:	what is a "ghost plot"?


[05-Apr-25 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you open the planet info page, new bfr: PLI OT-580b , in the middle you'll see Available Plots and the numbers 0/418 (+5)


[05-Apr-25 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thte +5 are ghost plots....there are 418 lots available on the planet, but 423 actual plots occupied


[05-Apr-25 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's only possible on starter worlds, and only because a new player can start anywhere regardless of availability - whereas an existing player is limited to available space to start a base on the planet

**Beherot**:	eeh uh any small qucik starting tips(please)? I literally just launched the game for the first time


[17-Apr-25 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	start with the tutorials


[17-Apr-25 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	especially that my stupid ass read but didn't memorise these small windows with the tutorials


[17-Apr-25 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	HELP menu top right


[17-Apr-25 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can go back to them


[17-Apr-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	wait, I just figured out what to do next on my own, usually I don't care much about tutorials and like to jump into the deep water if u get me


[17-Apr-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I believe the first few require you to do stuff, and have videos that give step by step how to


[17-Apr-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah no no that sounds too easy


[17-Apr-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	this is one of those games where the learning curve is quite steep


[17-Apr-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	if I dumb learn the hardway I won't remember much


[17-Apr-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	tutorials cover the day 1 basics, then your questions become a little more focused


[17-Apr-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	mate I used to play Aurora I know what I signed for xd


[17-Apr-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I think at least


[17-Apr-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you have questions, happy to answer them


[17-Apr-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I already love you mate


[17-Apr-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the community is quite helpful


[17-Apr-25 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	we were all new once, and there's a lot to see and do to get comfortable with the UI


[17-Apr-25 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I already love the UI


[17-Apr-25 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I have a kink for spreadsheets that pretend to be a game


[17-Apr-25 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	me too...it's pretty flexible


[17-Apr-25 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	then you're in the right place


[17-Apr-25 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	wait, I click to build, now where can I see my construction stuff


[17-Apr-25 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	nvm


[17-Apr-25 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	oy I got a serious question, is it possible to spread it on two monitors?


[17-Apr-25 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	something more than just making the window just wider?


[17-Apr-25 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm not that tech savvy


[17-Apr-25 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though you can create new screens, and customize them


[17-Apr-25 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ideally I'd love to, if I could, have 2 'main' windows which I could move around, just like in Aurora


[17-Apr-25 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	once you built your CM (base), you move your stuff from ship to base inventory (open both and drag and drop or just click unload)


[17-Apr-25 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	it seems I cant move ingame windows outside the main window


[17-Apr-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you may be able to open a second browser in the other monitor with a second iteration of the program, not sure


[17-Apr-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have heard of others using multiple monitors, so I know its possible


[17-Apr-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(just don't know how personally)


[17-Apr-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	oy that's actually smart what u just said


[17-Apr-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	u heard the rumors ay?


[17-Apr-25 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my desk is only big enough for one


[17-Apr-25 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though I could mount them on the wall


[17-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	panoramic PrUn


[17-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	you can get a (leg) stand and mount a second one above your main


[17-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yes also on the wall


[17-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	budget cuts and all

**Zugore**:	still running windows 7


[17-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah I feel you


[17-Apr-25 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Windows 10/11 is free


[17-Apr-25 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	All that paying the £10 for a license key does is remove from your desktop how you havent paid


[17-Apr-25 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	even if something is free doesnt mean is better mate


[17-Apr-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	£10 for a key, I think mine was even less


[17-Apr-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah right right


[17-Apr-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	historically I just wait til the blue screen of death appears tbh


[17-Apr-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I didnt pay


[17-Apr-25 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're still on a free license which will limit your game play a bit


[17-Apr-25 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	didn't pay but neither pirate, I just found an old key from previous pc and used it

**Beherot**:	ah ah I feel stupid cuz I never remember those


[17-Apr-25 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the free license is like a never ending trial game


[17-Apr-25 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and I put it myself too


[17-Apr-25 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	£1000 for mine, why pay £2000 for it


[17-Apr-25 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	limits you to solo play (other than chat) and manual everything and ship/base limitations


[17-Apr-25 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Kept same case, same bluray, same PCI 4 MM2, super fast


[17-Apr-25 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Not counting the bios screen, 2 secs to fully loaded desktop


[17-Apr-25 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I paid sligtly less but I got a lot of discounts thanks to one of my buddy who works at place where he assembles pc for 20k+ lol


[17-Apr-25 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Beherot**:	yes


[17-Apr-25 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I am ~20min old


[17-Apr-25 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The 3 month state if you stay on free tends to be the pay or leave point


[17-Apr-25 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	4-5 planets, starts to keep one occupied


[17-Apr-25 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	is it one time pay or a subscription


[17-Apr-25 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	And they have discount deals every now and again


[17-Apr-25 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	sounds reasonable


[17-Apr-25 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Be warned, the longer it goes on, the more addictive it becomes


[17-Apr-25 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	if I stay for that long or at least a month then I'll think about it


[17-Apr-25 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I am immune to stuff that are addictive


[17-Apr-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I thought that too, 7 months ago


[17-Apr-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I tried too many things already in life to lie about it


[17-Apr-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I mean, I ain't dunno a halfgod, I'm not ofc trully immune, I just know what I can and cannot handle + where the line is


[17-Apr-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I was thinking of some weird ladyboy joke then

**Zugore**:	MOR


[17-Apr-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	actually, it says to get EXT but there I can only get limestone or iron while I set up my profesion to be fuel engineer, did I just chose wrong planet?


[17-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	follow all the tutorial


[17-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	how do I mine input stuff for REF, or I just have wrong building for basic res?

**Beherot**:	ugh tutorial


[17-Apr-25 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but I like talkies


[17-Apr-25 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You have limestone and iron on your planet, EXT gets them


[17-Apr-25 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	A rig will get water, and a collector the oxygen


[17-Apr-25 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can only ext resources that are listed on the planet page


[17-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so I putting it into simple words: I fucked up with the planet


[17-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	rig = liquid, col = atmospheric, ext = mineral


[17-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your planet is a good one


[17-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're really not limited to the starting profession, you can do anything


[17-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but there's not stuff that I can mine for fuel


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You dont want to be making fuel, its worth pennies


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yes yes I know but I wanted to do fuel stuff gugh it's just seems I can't start with it in the end


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Extract the limestone only, and sell it.


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	well, too late I did chose starter stuff for fuel


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	use this time to find the right planet, then coliq and start there


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Wrong planet for fuel, and fueling refining isnt much money


[17-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	limestone worth more than iron?


[17-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You want to start as a farmer, or in construction and metallurgy.


[17-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Farming is Promitor, the other is Vallis


[17-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah was thinking between fuel and metal stuff, I choose wrongly it seems


[17-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You can restart by clicking New Bfr bottom left and typing COLIQ


[17-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or coliq and choose a different starting profession with a start on a planet you could not otherwise build on (like Promitor), then grow into fuel stuff


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Farming choose Promitor, Construction/Metallurgy choose Vallis


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	will I lose u guys if I start anew now?


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you won't have a base here so won't see this


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	sad


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I already fell in love with u guys


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I`m on Vallis chat too


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but I have a base on vallis, not prom - and there's always the global help chat


[17-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Metallurgy is good profits for new starters


[17-Apr-25 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	which is a better resource for starter questions, you get a broader audience


[17-Apr-25 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Dont become a farmer down in Promitor, they are all inbreds down there, join us on Vallis, join the darkside


[17-Apr-25 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and there's always DM


[17-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	boom boom guy convinced me


[17-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the thing with Prom is if you don't start there, you'll never get a base there


[17-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You might have to wait 24 hours before you can COLIQ


[17-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Is same for vallis though, if he dont start there he never will


[17-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	shouldn't have to if he's never done it


[17-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Build out your vallis base smelting CU or SI and you can make over 100k a day pure profit


[17-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	vallis clears periodically, thats how I got there
