Hello. Is Antic actually a planet? Where is it located?

Is it just Antares I c?


[09-Apr-22 05:09 AM] allocater#0000
Yes, it's the nickname for Antares I c üòÑ

@spatial_piano PSM PSL requests are up (DCM was already filled by rando)


[09-Apr-22 08:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater please make a request for 2 DEC and another for 10 DEC with 20 days delivery on A1C LM. 1 AIC for all. This is for CQS + CQM.


[09-Apr-22 08:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
when it is time to deliver the 10 DEC contract, I will also bring a full ship of metal alloys from deimos for you and @spatial_piano

[10-Apr-22 07:12 AM] yang_mills#0000
Regarding the name of ANT 1 c, we should keep the Greek mythology theme, related to the god Ares (Greek god of war). Phobos (god of fear) and Deimos (god of dread) are twin sons of Ares and Aphrodite. Harmonia (goddess of agreement) is daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. Nike is the Greek goddess of victory, and she is related to Ares. Possible names for ANT 1 c could be Enyalios (son of Ares and Enyo), Enyo (goddess of war) or Eris (goddess of strife and discord, the opposite of Harmonia).


[10-Apr-22 07:39 AM] insensless72#0000
@yang_mills Unfortunately, to name a planet you have to be a Star level supporter, which I dont think any of us are. Its 170 Euro (1 time) on top of your monthly payment


[10-Apr-22 07:39 AM] insensless72#0000
It would be really cool though


[10-Apr-22 07:54 AM] allocater#0000
yeah it will probably be named Eris according to the naming thread


[11-Apr-22 05:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
ANT 1 c has been named Hephaestus.


[11-Apr-22 05:42 PM] insensless72#0000

[16-Apr-22 09:55 AM] allocater#0000
if you dont need to go to heph you can bring the AST to ANT or phobos whatever makes more sense, also you can bring AL, but I have to buy it first on deimos


[16-Apr-22 09:56 AM] insensless72#0000
Phobos works for me, I can get some fuel. How much AL do you need?


[16-Apr-22 09:57 AM] allocater#0000

[26-Apr-22 03:49 PM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone  Just set up my 5th base on Hephaestus. For now there are only 2 BMP there producing PE. For now I will mostly focus on expanding my bases on Deimos and Nike, and then Harmonia. I will come back to Hephaestus later. I rushed for a 5th base so as to secure a plot there. With all these new players, one could never know what could happen.

well then let me welcome you with a PE ad üòÑ


[27-Apr-22 11:09 AM] allocater#0000
I wonder why PE is not done by POL, BMP already has so much


[27-Apr-22 11:12 AM] namthorn#0000
needs to be done by a basic building i think, it's used in a lot of recipes


[27-Apr-22 11:13 AM] namthorn#0000
now if they were to make the POL a pioneer-only building and a chemistry starter package, then I'd be for it.


[27-Apr-22 11:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PE is needed to build the POL


[27-Apr-22 11:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
POL plastics are for tier 2+ tech, PE is tier 1


[27-Apr-22 11:21 AM] allocater#0000
ok but they could at least give the recipe to POL too, maybe even with a bit better ratio


[27-Apr-22 11:39 AM] namthorn#0000
nah its a new player staple, they'd get destroyed in the market if POLs did it for cheaper and required higher tier workers to set up.


[27-Apr-22 11:39 AM] namthorn#0000
manufacturing is already hard enough to get started in


[27-Apr-22 02:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
Not so fast. I need PE myself for my PP1. I will see if accumulate a reserve in a couple of days.

@churavis has only recently joined, it is likely that he is not aware of the offer


[24-May-22 01:44 PM] churavis#0000
I've seen the ads but don't have enough C production. If someone gets me a bit of C then I'd gladly fill the SUN ads


[24-May-22 01:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think this offer of BMPs on hephaestus is more complicated than that. I will leave it for @allocater to explain


[24-May-22 01:49 PM] churavis#0000
I thought you were talking about the SUN ads on Phobos


[24-May-22 02:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, that was the context, but then allocater mentioned his BMP offer on hephaestus after it became clear that corporate BMP time was a limiting factor


[24-May-22 02:26 PM] allocater#0000
@churavisIf you have a free permit, I would give you all construction materials, C and H on heph, so you can produce lots of PE (and other stuff) which we would buy from you at a discount. BMP products are very desired right now, but we don't have space anymore to build it, so it would be awesome if someone in the corp would run a BMP base and heph is perfect for manufacturing, if you are interested


[24-May-22 02:47 PM] churavis#0000
I have two free permits currently. My present goal is to build an AL base on Deimos as soon as a plot opens up, which could be any moment now. After that I'd be glad to make a Haephestus manufacturing base.


[24-May-22 02:49 PM] namthorn#0000
you're in luck!

nodes and asynchronous updates most likely


[24-May-22 02:52 PM] namthorn#0000
likeyoutube and the like count on videos


[24-May-22 02:53 PM] namthorn#0000
best bet is to stick a ship with a CM kit on planet and check back every day or so


[24-May-22 02:53 PM] namthorn#0000
there'll likely be a spare one pop up every few days


[24-May-22 02:53 PM] churavis#0000
I thought PrUn only had the one server?


[24-May-22 02:54 PM] namthorn#0000
idk what the backend looks like but i've had differing versions of the truth to others before


[24-May-22 02:54 PM] churavis#0000
That is my plan as soon as I have enough saved up for one

BFab prices are still ridiculous after somebody nuked the market üòâ


[24-May-22 02:55 PM] namthorn#0000
good thing we have corp fab prices eh?


[24-May-22 02:55 PM] namthorn#0000
caveat is you have to go to nike to get them üòõ


[24-May-22 02:56 PM] churavis#0000
Do I have access to corp prices, not officially being in the corp yet?


[24-May-22 02:56 PM] namthorn#0000
well, that's a perk of sticking around I guess!


[24-May-22 03:00 PM] namthorn#0000
aha, figured it out, client-side caching is why there's a difference. So there was a plot open at some point today


[24-May-22 03:01 PM] churavis#0000
So someone else was already waiting around for a plot to open up


[24-May-22 03:04 PM] namthorn#0000
or a new player filled it in yea


[24-May-22 03:22 PM] allocater#0000
I have also this on deimos, so you can use it directly for base building:

With help, sure


[24-May-22 03:24 PM] allocater#0000
well, heph you get the b-fabs for free, and for deimos bases we have credit line of 200k, so you can buy the bfabs

not urgent, but required for the super high-end FTL reactors (EES)


[01-Jun-22 02:56 PM] insensless72#0000
Well I forgot the LDE, so my base will be up on Heph tomorrow


[01-Jun-22 02:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on this topic, have you thought more about the SPP? since you have reasonably easy access to technetium and kevlar?


[01-Jun-22 02:57 PM] namthorn#0000
SPP?


[01-Jun-22 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its a production building. BUI SPP


[01-Jun-22 02:58 PM] namthorn#0000
ah


[01-Jun-22 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its not one that we would run 24/7. highly specialized


[01-Jun-22 02:59 PM] churavis#0000
Careful, Hephaestus only has 14 unemployed engineers currently


[01-Jun-22 02:59 PM] namthorn#0000
interesting. well I can't put it here as I don't have a heph base. But I can supply the TCL for the KV and the TC for the TK


[01-Jun-22 03:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you build it, they will come


[01-Jun-22 03:00 PM] namthorn#0000
could maybe dump it on Deimos


[01-Jun-22 03:00 PM] namthorn#0000
a lot of shippiung required there though


[01-Jun-22 03:00 PM] namthorn#0000
might be best for someone with a pre-existing base here to drop it, to keep the WPLs in the same place as the SPP and the shipyard


[01-Jun-22 03:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea if you already have technetium and kevlar on griffonstone‚Ä¶ maybe that is a bigger advantage than being on hephaestus


[01-Jun-22 03:01 PM] insensless72#0000
When Marky coliqs they will be available, im replacing his Heph base

[01-Jun-22 03:01 PM] namthorn#0000
i dont have WPL to make the TK/KV is the problem


[01-Jun-22 03:01 PM] namthorn#0000
i would assume those are here


[01-Jun-22 03:01 PM] namthorn#0000
on heph


[01-Jun-22 03:02 PM] namthorn#0000
could maybe either add a base here for just those buildings or add them to an eventual Nike settlement. But I need my next 2 permits to expand griffonstone (EEP is 100 area xD) and settle the LES place, at least temporarily.


[01-Jun-22 03:05 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have one (soon to be 2) WPL on Phobos if you would like me to make you some?


[01-Jun-22 03:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Please keep these in production if  possible. I also need them on Nike for LDE and RDE


[01-Jun-22 03:07 PM] insensless72#0000
KV and NL that is


[01-Jun-22 03:09 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, they're not going anywhere. Right now I am primarily making COT for PWO but I am building a second one to expand NL production - can also start making KV/TK as needed, however I'll need to source TC and TCL


[01-Jun-22 03:09 PM] namthorn#0000
this is kinda the issue. WPLs run incredibly slow. pretty much 2 days for 1 TK baseline


[01-Jun-22 03:10 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm open to building a 3rd one but that will prob be a week away


[01-Jun-22 03:14 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Also, apparently base teleporting is a thing? My Phobos base is mainly manufacturing so I would be interested in moving it to Hephaestus if possible?


[01-Jun-22 03:19 PM] namthorn#0000
that's just when someone sells you the fabs & mats for a CM on the destination planet


[01-Jun-22 03:19 PM] namthorn#0000
so you effectively teleport over there without sending a ship


[01-Jun-22 03:20 PM] yjhasaday#0000
ahhhhh okay, thanks for clarifying üôÇ

@Hephaestus has the dust settled on our WPL situation?

In case I did not make this clear to anyone, the reasoning for this push is to make vertical TK into the SPP for advance ship upgrades.


[26-Jun-22 01:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dersix will run the SPP on Hephaestus, and @namthorn will supply the TCL and Technetium to make KV and TK repsectively


[26-Jun-22 01:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the only thing missing is WPL capacity, and I am thinking I should base on Hephaestus and just eat the TK production expense and remove the bottleneck


[26-Jun-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In order to do this, though, I will need TCL or KV supply, so this should not be interpreted as a reason to get rid of WPL. Still we need more.


[26-Jun-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Last but not least, I have purchased 150 NL from benten and am currently bringing it home. This should help us pump kevlar without interfering with fundamental construction workflows for a week or two.


[26-Jun-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 @allocater 
I can pass these NL to you guys for the PP2+


[26-Jun-22 01:41 PM] allocater#0000
@churavis can build as many WPL as necessary I think


[26-Jun-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK, that would work, but I have allowed this to become time sensitive from my lack of action so far


[26-Jun-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe I will get WPL temporarily and gradually shift the work to churavis as it fits his schedule


[26-Jun-22 01:43 PM] allocater#0000
so all WPL switch to KV now? Fine by me, TCL is on site


[26-Jun-22 01:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes at least for a few days


[26-Jun-22 01:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dersix what will you do with these 7 WPL on hephaestus? Sorry if you have already explained this


[26-Jun-22 01:46 PM] dersix#0000
right now they are 50/50 NL/KV


[26-Jun-22 01:46 PM] dersix#0000
the KV is for rfabs


[26-Jun-22 01:46 PM] dersix#0000
the NL the backupo when I'm short at TCL


[26-Jun-22 01:46 PM] dersix#0000
(and some LDE for RDE)


[26-Jun-22 01:47 PM] dersix#0000
but I can drop the NL as LDE are easy to source now


[26-Jun-22 01:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK that sounds like a good base capacity to keep the LFAB and RFAB flowing in corp


[26-Jun-22 01:47 PM] dersix#0000

only rfab, I'm runing negative on everything else (8 PP3 on NIKE)


[26-Jun-22 01:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think our biggest challenge is going to be TCL.

So is there a demand for more WPL and a sufficient supply of TCL?


[26-Jun-22 02:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
I run 1 WPL on Heph, and produce NL there.


[26-Jun-22 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, for TK


[26-Jun-22 03:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ship buyer (sometimes me) is the real demand, Pokter is the TK consumer in our internal production

I have 8 BMP's running at 140% efficiency and no source of my own so I need a lot of H


[28-Jun-22 10:03 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I just ramped up H extraction to 10 COLs so I should be bringing more and more back in the near future. I generally need it on Nike but I stop off at Phobos along the way. I won't be moving it to Heph often but you're welcome to buy large quantities on Phobos if you can take care of moving it to Heph. Or you can always send your own ship out to QJ-382g and I'll sell it to you even cheaper at the source! There's already a LM on planet and in a couple days I should have a warehouse available as well!

time for the first 3k volume ship?


[28-Jun-22 10:24 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Haha I'm in conversation with @bitcoin_ape about it - even another 2000 would be great. For now I'm fine just chartering the other OOG ships - current QJ inventory is pretty empty. But I do make about 500m3/day out there so in a few days..... lol

The crazy thing is: it doesn't seem to be enough. Both AMM and H seem to disappear pretty damn fast - despite the large quantities! I do burn a lot of both of them myself though. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[28-Jun-22 10:24 AM] jackinabox86#0000

@allocater We can do a cost analysis on the 3k volume, but it is super expensive to build


[28-Jun-22 11:54 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think 2k is more practical. The 3 kiloton bay like Bucephalus is an even easier build than the 2k/2k ship, because it is smaller and requires less plates and ftl emitters

Got it, thanks, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to actually take the delivery in sell contracts, I wonder why it‚Äôs different for buy contracts‚Ä¶


[28-Aug-22 10:26 AM] insensless72#0000
Its because of storage space. If you didnt have enough the contract wouldnt go through automatically

who has WPL?


[30-Aug-22 10:55 AM] rune_242#0000
I have 120 RCO that I would like converted into COT


[30-Aug-22 10:58 AM] allocater#0000
I have 1 measly WPL which makes NL full time. There is lots of potential to build more WPL on heph.


[30-Aug-22 11:00 AM] rune_242#0000
I'm planning on building a base there but the COT is somewhat urgent


[30-Aug-22 11:00 AM] churavis#0000
I have 4 WPL mostly making NL but I could spare half of them which would take about 2 weeks to weave that much cotton


[30-Aug-22 11:00 AM] churavis#0000
I have 20 COT in stock at the moment

I definitely need H (I only have the standard ship though). Do you need anything from the CX? I have both my ships over there right now


[30-Aug-22 01:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm running out and will have extra H from what I'm bringing back.  Can drop at Phobos or ANT.  Up to 1300 available at the 30/u


[30-Aug-22 01:48 PM] balbar#0000
ANT would be nice, I'll put up the contract


[30-Aug-22 01:49 PM] balbar#0000

whoops, no buying/selling ads on CX...then Phobos I guess


[30-Aug-22 01:54 PM] jackinabox86#0000
just send me a buy ad on Phobos, then a shipping contract from there to the CX.  I've got a 2000 ship so I won't make you do multiple trips.  Where is the H going to end up?


[30-Aug-22 01:55 PM] balbar#0000

[30-Aug-22 02:33 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I would be willing to buy any RAT or DW you can bring with you. Happy to pay CX prices, just let me know what you paid for it. Also the warehouse on QJ382g is really expensive so next time you come out just message me and I'll post a sell ad for you so you don't need to pay the WAR fee üôÇ


[30-Aug-22 02:34 PM] balbar#0000
good to know


[30-Aug-22 02:35 PM] yjhasaday#0000
It looks like @jackinabox86 is taking care of the shipping for you so I'll coordinate any RAT/DW with him


[30-Aug-22 02:39 PM] balbar#0000
I have rat/dw on phobos and a ship going there. I will bring stuff over when I head to QJ-382 afterwards. just a few 100 though @50AIC each


[30-Aug-22 02:40 PM] yjhasaday#0000
So are you buying the 1300 that Jack is picking up or are you also sending a ship out for the 500 contract that you posted on LM? I can fill both but I just want to know before I do because we can still terminate the 500 contract?


[30-Aug-22 02:42 PM] allocater#0000

He certainly answered that question at UFO before any of us had a chance to think it through!  My view is always that if these one-off governors want to run it, then we let them do it without expending any mind bandwith.  Appropriate donations are fine, but they can either join the network and get the benefits or play the game the way they want

I have just under 5K H on QJ-382g right now if anyone wants to make a trip out to grab some!

you can coordinate with balbar, but BMP, POL, PPF, WPL are all needed

Why do you want to build POL in Heph? Chemical industry needs Global chamber of commerce reward.üòÖ


[24-Oct-22 03:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
The demand of WPL is very great, although it is not very profitable.


[24-Oct-22 03:53 AM] rune_242#0000
you think?


[24-Oct-22 03:53 AM] rune_242#0000
if you turn RCO --> COT you dubble the value


[24-Oct-22 04:10 AM] balbar#0000
PPF needs manufacturing though


[24-Oct-22 04:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, COT is the most profitable WPL product, but unless you make MED, I'm afraid there is not much demand.


[24-Oct-22 08:28 AM] jackinabox86#0000

We're turning QJ-650 into a CHEM base and I will also be building a BMP base there to provide MG and I. See the discussion in strategy.

I keep inputs for MCG in stock, but usually only have a small trickle being made regularly

If I need to I could swap to 100% mcg for a brief period and crank out a ton.


[14-Dec-22 07:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
@jackinabox86I have 4k MCG in ANT. My Heph needs to store too many things. I have shipped MCG, SEA, SUN, OFF and so on to ANT.

If you know a few days in advance that you're gonna need some MCG, I can make a ton of it really quickly. 

I normally don't keep a stockpile (maybe I should ü§î) since my base is focused on making PE, but I can switch to other products easily as I tend to keep the inputs for lots of the BMP goods around.

Looks like I need 1.2/1.5k H2O a day to keep up with production at this efficiency level :/ Holy hell. And that's the slower option.

Optimal DW production is 56 DW in 23h30m for 80 H2O, per FP, so x29 = roughly 1,630 DW @ 2.5k H2O/day


[21-Dec-22 06:52 PM] churavis#0000

So strange Dez set you up on Heph. I‚Äôd have thought he‚Äôd want you on Norwick. We do regular water runs there. No one runs water to Heph. Most importantly, you get the COGC there. That would enable you to do more with less construction inputs early on


[21-Dec-22 10:25 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But you‚Äôre starting out, so it isn‚Äôt a huge deal. I‚Äôve moved plenty of bases from planet to planet as I‚Äôve grown and optimized


[21-Dec-22 10:25 PM] jackinabox86#0000
You do have to rebuild experts, which is annoying

I believe Dehzhas has an FP base on Hephaestus and Phobos, right?


[21-Dec-22 10:36 PM] dehzhas#0000
It's a logistics thing more than an optimization thing. I operate 3 FP bases oh Heph, 2 on Deimos, 1 on Ant II b, 1 on Harmonia


[21-Dec-22 10:37 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm moving the Harmonia one to Norwick right now.


[21-Dec-22 10:37 PM] churavis#0000
I would have thought you'd put one on Norwick first, for the COGC bonus


[21-Dec-22 10:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
A puddle jumper serving 3 FP bases rather than having to make runs to/from Norwick is very valuable. It gave me a leg up early on just to avoid the long trip to Norwick. My big ships are doing runs to/from Etherwind hauling H2O.


[21-Dec-22 10:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
Until recently I couldn't spend the time to/from Norwick. Now I can, hence why I am setting up shop there too.


[21-Dec-22 10:39 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, learned the hard way that norwick is in east bumblefuck


[21-Dec-22 10:40 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Took a shipping contract out that way and it took me nearly 3 days to complete all in all.


[21-Dec-22 10:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah... vs. a puddle jumper that can go to/from ANT in about 2 hours


[21-Dec-22 10:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
or 4 hours if I don't want to guzzle fuel


[21-Dec-22 10:40 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

ish... depends


[21-Dec-22 10:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
I think the standard OOG one is 600k


[21-Dec-22 10:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
my basic ship takes an *insane* amount of time to try and make it to heph from ANT or vice versa.


[21-Dec-22 10:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like well over a day, maybe closer to 2 days


[21-Dec-22 10:42 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Nice. I'll definitely be investing in a puddle jumper asap. I'd like to get more ships airborne as soon as I can afford it.

I burn more fuel to go faster

@dehzhas Let me know when you're online so we can provision the H2O, I think our schedules are conflicting and I keep logging on right after you've left for the day. If I keep running dry like this I'll never finish the contract in time ;_;


[24-Dec-22 03:04 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll try to figure something out and pop on earlier in the day so we can get that out of the way.


[24-Dec-22 03:26 AM] dehzhas#0000
Provisioned. No worries on the payment time, the running dry is on me, I got you covered.


[24-Dec-22 03:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
‚ù§Ô∏è I'll log on and pick it up now


[24-Dec-22 03:32 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might it be feasible for me to send you an H2O contract back, prepaid, so you can provision when you log on? Maybe that'd help?


[24-Dec-22 03:35 AM] dehzhas#0000
We just need to get you provisioned a day ahead


[24-Dec-22 03:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Production time's down to 4hr 29m with 2/5 experts, so I figure 4hr cycles... 290 H2O per cycle.... so 6 cycles a day, 290x6= 1750ish H2O


[24-Dec-22 03:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Jesus. Yeah so I'm using nearly 2k H2O a day even with the 'slower' option


[24-Dec-22 03:36 AM] dehzhas#0000
It should be 1815/day when you get to 5 experts


[24-Dec-22 03:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

[24-Dec-22 03:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, day-ahead secondary contract would prolly be the way to go


[24-Dec-22 03:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Guess that's the one downside of Heph FP, water is a bitch :/


[24-Dec-22 03:37 AM] dehzhas#0000
I just need to keep one provisioned, probably in smaller chunks so you can just grab it when you have room.


[24-Dec-22 03:37 AM] dehzhas#0000
That's just the downside of water... it consumes mega-water


[24-Dec-22 03:38 AM] dehzhas#0000
I'm supplying 5-6 bases at that rate


[24-Dec-22 03:38 AM] dehzhas#0000
so... you do the math


[24-Dec-22 03:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Maybe 1k chunks might work? Though its more annoying contract-sending. Granted, if you make a draft you can just set it on recurring I guess


[24-Dec-22 03:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's... a lot of water


[24-Dec-22 03:39 AM] dehzhas#0000

what's your cargo space like on your shipping?


[24-Dec-22 03:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
for the water route specifically


[24-Dec-22 03:41 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have 2 2k/2k ships constantly doing rounds between Etherwind and ANT brinking 10k+ in perday.


[24-Dec-22 03:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'd be curious to know if anyone with RL shipping experience gets into this game and just runs pure shipping with minimal focus on production


[24-Dec-22 03:42 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have another 2k/2k that takes occasional trips to keep the volume up and I have another H2O base going up on Ice Station Alpha shortly and hope to supply that with it's own 2k/2k ship capacity as well.


[24-Dec-22 03:42 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
What about outbound? Do you do Heph-Ant runs? or do you bring the DW back to etherwind


[24-Dec-22 03:45 AM] dehzhas#0000
Core shipping lanes:

Etherwind <-> ANT/Deimos as staging
ANT <-> Heph/Phobos using glass ship
Deimos <-> Ant II b using glass ship
Extra 2k/2k moving deliverables, extra H2O <-> Heph and other places
Original ships do other random supply runs

I have another 2k/2k ship on the way to help ease the burden. My real issue has been RAT inputs have been scarce as hell. I just converted Harmonia to HYF to produce RAT inputs on speed, but that really means I need that next 2k/2k ship to do Harmonia <-> Norwick runs for the RAT FP base

{Reactions}

[24-Dec-22 03:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
HYF is what?


[24-Dec-22 03:47 AM] dehzhas#0000
It's a lot to manage right now, but I am focused on simplifying the flow to make it easier and more reliable.


[24-Dec-22 03:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I run 12 FRMs with 4 RIGs on Harm, I actually produce net H2O I need to sell off occasionally to save space.


[24-Dec-22 03:47 AM] dehzhas#0000
HYF == Hydroponics Farm


[24-Dec-22 03:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh, haven't looked into that one yet.


[24-Dec-22 03:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I guess faster/more efficient agro but more input water?


[24-Dec-22 03:48 AM] dehzhas#0000
Consumes tons of H2O but you can grow certain agri products on any base at higher rates than FRMs


[24-Dec-22 03:48 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh nice


[24-Dec-22 03:48 AM] dehzhas#0000
Also requires NS (Nutrient Solution) as an input


[24-Dec-22 03:48 AM] dehzhas#0000
So, it's a bit more complicated and HYF bases are super expensive to build even on MCG planets


[24-Dec-22 03:49 AM] dehzhas#0000
But once they are up, they produce a lot.


[24-Dec-22 03:49 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Makes sense tbh. If you're going to have a highly-efficient post-FRM building, it's going to have downsides to maintain that increased production.


[24-Dec-22 03:49 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Very realistic, as far a hydrofarms go.


[24-Dec-22 03:51 AM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, there's really no other way to do it at volume though, so it is worth it.


[24-Dec-22 03:51 AM] dehzhas#0000
There are a few things that only grow on FRM and a few that only grow on HYF


[24-Dec-22 03:51 AM] dehzhas#0000
but you can make a valid RAT input combo on each.


[24-Dec-22 03:51 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Too bad I only have 7 leftover space. 10 more and I could've built a storage facility to significantly improve the logistical nightmare.


[24-Dec-22 03:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might end up doing that once I go independent. Slightly less overall production, but far less hassle.


[24-Dec-22 03:52 AM] dehzhas#0000
You can also use the warehouse on Heph


[24-Dec-22 03:52 AM] dehzhas#0000
I pretty much have a permanent maxed out warehouse on all my base planets (and others) to hold extra inputs and outputs.


[24-Dec-22 03:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah I'm using my warehouse on Heph to hold finished DW and free up the base. It'd absolutely suck to run out. I dunno if the game has a spillover mechanic where it'll automatically send to applicable local warehouse storage, or rent out extra storage when needed. That'd be pretty cool.


[24-Dec-22 03:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If not, then def a suggestion worth making.


[24-Dec-22 03:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

[24-Dec-22 04:07 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I've currently got space to spare with 1.7k H2O in stock, albeit low DW and workforce sup, but I'm fairly confident we can do 4k H2O


[24-Dec-22 04:08 AM] dehzhas#0000
Ok, just send me a 2.3k contract for H2O, I have to jump supplies in from ANT, but I can fill tomorrow


[24-Dec-22 04:08 AM] dehzhas#0000
or I guess, another 1k on top of what you just sent


[24-Dec-22 04:09 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I sent you a 2k contract before I logged off, so all together that should come out to 2 days of production

Throw up some ads on the LM for PE. I generally pick them up when I see them. I have a full 500/500 base almost entirely made of BMP that runs PE basically 100% of the time.

You can fill those later with the next batch, we can extend if needed

I used to have a smattering of BMPs on various planets to fill ~half my PE needs, but it was inefficient, so I replaced them

I have to fly ANT->Heph anyways, so the PE can just tag along. 

If you want to double up and also buy that same amount on ANT I can deliver those immediately. If you do I think I'll need a day or so for each of the Heph orders.

[29-Mar-23 10:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
There can be only one ECA and MCA, and if there is only one SCA, there is a little shortage of supply.


[29-Mar-23 10:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
According to my calculation, two SCA, one MCA, one SPF, three APF, one ECA and three ELP are a suitable proportion.

In addition, 1 UPF, 3 CLR, 10 SD , 5 SE and 3 SL are needed.

The number of ECA should not be too large, otherwise the demand for BE and LI will be too great. On the contrary,  SE can be built at will.

Oh RiseOfFilth is a a very spicy person. It's an interesting question if we would want to contest that race

He will butt into any election we are involved in, whether he is running or not

I have a whole weaving plant base on Antares I e (ZV-307e). It's pretty easy to keep it going between KV, COT, and NL


[16-Oct-23 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000

I have too much SCA production, so if anyone wants any of the following materials, I can make them for you. Having more inputs might help, depending on the materials (I can't keep up with TRNs, for example).

MPC, PCB, RAM, ROM, SEN, TPU

I have fairly big stocks of many of these components already.

SEN is 600/u


[09-Nov-23 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
(probably could go lower, just grabbing low prices on the CX)

Should we be trying to finesse getting both Hernanduer and Paris in?  I voted for Paris but since it doesn't look like we can topple Rise, that might be a wasted vote.  But we have enough votes to get both the other seats.

Hi there, please vote for me (Hernanduer) on Hephaestus! The current governor has been neglecting the planet by not improving the ENG for several population cycles, and we are now on the brink of running out of PIO!

Rise is winning in so many places just because he's the only person DMing everyone on the planets he's running on. He's just claiming some % of people who would've otherwise not voted and that overwhelms the amount of people who were actively participating in elections by a large margin.


[03-Aug-24 10:01 PM] hernanduer#0000

[04-Aug-24 12:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
that's probably outside t he bounds of our tool creation skills


[04-Aug-24 12:26 AM] archielvahr#0000

Does he not get enough taxes to fund this?


[26-Oct-24 07:47 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I've never been a governer, so idrk how the finances work our for planetary governments


[26-Oct-24 07:47 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Are they giant money pits or something?


[26-Oct-24 07:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
budget can be a bit tight (especially for small planets)... but in this case I am on the side of Rise here... Using my taxes for someone to get a boost... /s

It doesn't seem to be anywhere in the near future for development, but a worker salary mechanic would be amazing in general, but especially for situations like this


[26-Oct-24 07:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
a lot of things are missing from proper economy... You can't really make Black friday sales for example... People consume 2 apples... doesn't matter if they are 50% off today...


[26-Oct-24 07:55 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I mean, a sale does work if for example on an item with a large band gap, you price just a few items in the middle for some enterprising fellow to pick it up


[26-Oct-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
I mostly mean that you are not gonna buy items you don‚Äôt need


[26-Oct-24 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Rise has a philosophical opposition to running immigration jobs on his own funding, and I don't really understand the logic of it


[26-Oct-24 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
The workers are a pool that is shared among all people using that workforce


[26-Oct-24 10:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't buy the logic that some people enter at different times, and depending on when they enter the planet, they either are or aren't responsible for the cost of the workers they consume

The cynic in me would say it's because then it's not his fault if the POPR is low


[26-Oct-24 10:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
it was a joke btw üòÖ  probably should put /s at the end just in case


[26-Oct-24 10:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
ahhh heh


[27-Oct-24 02:46 AM] akyantor#0000
I agree. It‚Äôs nice if folks volunteer to fund a program, but ultimately it‚Äôs down to the governor to balance taxes such that funds are available to generate the pop required‚Ä¶. regardless of when you rock up needing it.

I'll suggest an ‚öì or :ship:


[12-Feb-25 01:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
If no one here wants the governor slot on Heph, I will endorse SilentReaper for it


[12-Feb-25 01:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know I don't want it üòÜ


[12-Feb-25 01:30 PM] akyantor#0000
If there really are no takers then I might put myself forward. It‚Äôs a lot nearer than the other planets I look after which are a lot simplier


[12-Feb-25 01:30 PM] akyantor#0000
I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to take on any others though


[12-Feb-25 01:31 PM] akyantor#0000
If it‚Äôs going to be our key gateway planet then we probably want the governor to be in our corp if we can.


[12-Feb-25 01:32 PM] akyantor#0000
I‚Äôve thrown my hat in


[12-Feb-25 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I'm not toooo worried about governor interference, esp if we end up with two MP seats (since bookliko is running too)


[12-Feb-25 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
And it's only 3 seats for the planets


[12-Feb-25 01:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know @bookliko  has a bunch of planets already, wasn't sure if you wanted governor slot here or not.


[12-Feb-25 01:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
(figured I should ping üôÇ )


[12-Feb-25 01:57 PM] bookliko#0000
No, have no particular ambition, but more of "doing my part" mentality. Happy to  take a role or step aside.


[12-Feb-25 02:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm all in favor of voting SilentReaper to gov just because he said ‚Äúhow hard can it be‚Äù, but I‚Äôm happy to vote for any of y‚Äôall üòÑ

[12-Feb-25 03:06 PM] tyrandia#0000
I'll try to take gov on Heph if you guys want... would be a good first planet for me to run?


[12-Feb-25 03:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's a fairly large one, but I don't think it's particularly challenging. Depends how much you want to jump in head-first


[12-Feb-25 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's pretty well balanced population-wise


[12-Feb-25 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think whatever we all decide, it's good to check in with the other people running (except xepiov)


[12-Feb-25 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
It seems to smooth things over when people are on the same page, even if they are competing.


[12-Feb-25 04:39 PM] akyantor#0000
I‚Äôll withdraw and we can focus on securing the two seats

[12-Feb-25 04:50 PM] bookliko#0000
go for it! I'll pull out as well


[13-Feb-25 03:07 AM] bookliko#0000
Looking at planet chat, it might be good for the candidates to announce that OOG will ensure excellent governance will be maintained

[13-Feb-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
ahhhh man apparently I'm winning


[13-Feb-25 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
SilentReaper has fewer votes than xepiov üòì


[13-Feb-25 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll endorse LiliDragon in com


[13-Feb-25 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
This is what I posted:

Thank you all for your support in the ongoing election. I'm actually endorsing LiliDragon for governor. I also echo Rise's enthusiasm for new players entering governance, and she will do a great job here. Personally I'm looking for an MP seat on Heph, which I will use to run the gateway side of things. The ADI Gateway Coop is planning two gates on Heph, and the administration and toll income is expected to end up in the government context. Then I will distribute that according to the rules of the cooperative and be responsible for weekly gateway upkeep.

Matters related to the planet will be the governor's job, as usual. I have a lot of other planets and space jobs, so I am happy to delegate that.
