Also I've now started to consistently produce OFF on Phobos (thanks to a generous EPO/PG contribution from @namthorn ) - is there a specific building I should aim to contribute OFF to? I can also send some to Nike, I just need some guidance on how to prioritize? (I wouldn't think art/culture buildings are as important since our focus is more scientific on Phobos right?)


[05-Apr-22 10:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the game mechanic is that culture buildings on a planet attract scientists and engineers as a workforce


[05-Apr-22 10:35 AM] yjhasaday#0000
oh.
Okay, so I just contribute to whatever needs it the most then?


[05-Apr-22 10:36 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[13-Apr-22 02:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
The wildlife parks on Phobos ran out of upkeep. Could anyone provide 150 DW for them?


[13-Apr-22 04:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
We should supply the wildlife parks on Phobos. The comfort is low, 18,6 percent, and will get worse if we don't take measures. On top of that, according to game mechanics, the education cannot get higher than comfort. So low comfort automatically implies low education. In the POPR today, the education is also 18,6 percent. This is because it has been capped by the comfort.


[13-Apr-22 04:38 AM] yang_mills#0000
I gave 20 DW for PAR on Phobos. This was en emergency measure. I don't have much more DW. Please, someone, supply the PAR. Just throw in some DW if you have it on Phobos. More supplies could be imported from the CX. I will have a ship on Antares Station in 20 h.


[13-Apr-22 04:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
I bought 90 PFE on CX. Will bring it to Phobos in 2 days. It's for PAR (wildlife parks).


[13-Apr-22 04:45 AM] yang_mills#0000
Getting PAR supplied should be the highest priority right now.


[13-Apr-22 04:55 AM] yang_mills#0000
If the corporation agrees, I could buy more upkeep mats for PAR on CX and bring it to Phobos in 2 days. But I would need to be provided cash for that. It is rather expensive. @bitcoin_ape @allocater @dasefx1


[13-Apr-22 11:24 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills ill cover up to 50k AIC from the CX for this purpose.


[13-Apr-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
A more permanent and economical solution is to build dedicated production for wildlife parks consumables

In total I bought on the CX 150 SOI for 30 000 AIC, 130 DW for 8970 AIC and 90 PFE for 22500 AIC. So in total I spent 61 470 AIC. I would like to be reimbursed at least partially.


[13-Apr-22 05:07 PM] yang_mills#0000
Could you, please, donate DW for the Wildlife park on Phobos? Because next consumption in in 16h and my ship would arrive only later. Wildlife park is needed for comfort and comfort is low on Phobos. Moreover, the level of the education is capped by the level of comfort. So maintaining the libraries and the universities without maintaining the wildlife park is just wasting materials.

250 OFF to phobos


[16-Apr-22 03:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills 
@erklein 
I think it is best to put all 250 OFF into the safety station at this point. The Infirmary is already stocked for 2 weeks, and the SST stocked for only 1 week.


[16-Apr-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The only other option is the PBH, which is lower priority because its too expensive to supply well and is redundant with university + art gallery


[16-Apr-22 04:54 PM] yang_mills#0000
We don't have PBH on Phobos. It's not completed yet.

100 TUBs on Nike but this was about a week ago, forgot to post


[06-May-22 05:14 AM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone Did somebody get the DW from @dasefx1 ? We need it for the upkeep of POPI and the COGC on Phobos?


[06-May-22 05:19 AM] yang_mills#0000
@namthorn @yjhasaday @megasaberexe How many TUB do you produce per day, on average?


[06-May-22 05:23 AM] namthorn#0000
tend to do batches with excess GL, can make 640/d while  GL stocks last


[06-May-22 05:25 AM] namthorn#0000
probably about 120/d if i just did TUB permanently


[06-May-22 05:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
Cool. UNI on Phobos needs 100 TUB/day, INF on Phobos 20 TUB/day, and INF on Nike 10 TUB/day. That's a total of 130 TUB/day. Right now the UNI on Phobos is low on upkeep and we should provide TUB for it. It's the easiest of the upkeep consumables for the university. Do you have TUB in stock?


[06-May-22 05:27 AM] namthorn#0000
i have 590 on deimos yea


[06-May-22 05:28 AM] namthorn#0000
not flying deimos -> phobos though, if someone could take them either deimos -> phobos or ANT -> phobos we could get them there.


[06-May-22 05:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
I could ship it all to Phobos.


[06-May-22 05:29 AM] namthorn#0000

I am very slow at TUB. I only have 1 GF and I need it to make glass as well. So I do 2 runs of glass for every run of TUB which works out to about 10 per day üòï


[06-May-22 08:42 AM] yang_mills#0000
I do the same. Also have 1 GF on Deimos.

@yang_mills  Been kinda slow on making more tubs, but i have about 500 on nike


[06-May-22 11:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
If you agree to donate your TUB, you could give 100 more to the infirmary on Nike, so as to fill the reserve, and donate the 400 other TUB to the university on Phobos. I can ship it to Phobos, if you wish.


[06-May-22 11:31 AM] megasaberexe#0000
@yang_mills I see that would a good idea. TUBs filled on nike +100. Do you want to post a ad for the 400 TUBs?


[06-May-22 11:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ad is up.


[06-May-22 11:34 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Done, I plan on expanding my GF eventually and since i have a somewhat daily route that includes nike and phobos. I can supply TUBs to both infirmary, maybe even deimos. But it might take awhile.


[06-May-22 11:36 AM] yang_mills#0000
Thank you! Your 400 TUB will be donated on Phobos. Our priority as a corporation is the upkeep on Nike and Phobos, since we govern these planets. The upkeep on Deimos is not our responsibility.


[06-May-22 11:39 AM] megasaberexe#0000
No prob, also right deimos is not ours as of yet.......


[06-May-22 11:40 AM] allocater#0000
I got the water from yaro, where should I dump it?


[06-May-22 11:45 AM] yang_mills#0000
Do you have it all on Phobos? You could donate 1050 to the park on Phobos. This will fill the reserve. Some DW should be also brought to Nike. Something like 2000 DW to Nike, for the park, and the safety station. It all depends how much you have got from yaro. I believe he had 8K DW.


[06-May-22 11:48 AM] yang_mills#0000
You can still donate to Deimos. A bunch of us, and perhaps yourself, have a base on Deimos, and if the governor Bobemor cannot provide enough upkeep to the infirmary there, we might help him for our own good. But again, that's not our priority.


[06-May-22 11:52 AM] allocater#0000
I got 9000 on phobos, you can request it, I have no ships on the route to nike or deimos


[06-May-22 11:53 AM] yang_mills#0000
I will request only 5K DW. Storage limitations.

@Governor Just to let you know. I have 7K DW from yaro transmitted by @allocater. I will use it for POPI and also COGC. 1,5 K DW will fly to Nike for the upkeep there. This will fill the reserve of SST and PAR there. 5,5 K DW will stay on Phobos. A lot will be needed for the COGC. PAR on Phobos is already full, but not the SST.


[06-May-22 04:38 PM] yang_mills#0000

@everyone I remember that yaro also had plenty of RAT. Did anyone take it? We don't need RAT as much as DW for the upkeep. It is used only for the COGC. Still, I could take something like 2K RAT and keep it in reserve for the COGC on Phobos.


[07-May-22 02:57 AM] allocater#0000

[07-May-22 11:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone Just wanted to know if somebody is going to supply more SUN and OFF for the upkeep on Phobos. We need 18 SUN and 80 OFF per day on average. Priority is SUN because we have only 6 days of upkeep for the SST left. Right now I am producing 40 SUN. Are there other people who could contribute? Contributions of EPO are also welcome since these are required for OFF.


[07-May-22 11:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
By the way, SUN and OFF are produced in BMPs.


[07-May-22 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills I have carbon and epoxy on phobos that I can donate for this production, but no BMPs to actually do the work


[07-May-22 12:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. I have 1 BMP on Phobos and more on Hephaestus. Do you also have PG on Phobos?


[07-May-22 12:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Normally yes, but PG supply is tight for the next 5 days since I have just spent alot of time producing EPO and DEC


[07-May-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
actually I can have 1k PG ready inside of 3 days, and still make my obligations


[07-May-22 12:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
That's Ok. I have my own small reserve of PG on Phobos. Could you provide me then 100 EPO? That's 250 OFF. Perhaps there are other people who have BMPs on Phobos and PG who could take some more EPO. I would also take 50 C for 100 SUN.


[07-May-22 12:14 PM] namthorn#0000
ive been donating EPO & PG to @yjhasaday for this too, have we run out of supplies? I can bring some more over shortly if so.

[07-May-22 12:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
Requested 100 more EPO. I won't request more C because SUN also requires OVE and I will have to produce this one too.


[07-May-22 12:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also C takes a lot of space.


[07-May-22 12:20 PM] yang_mills#0000

can I buy 40 of the OFF?


[07-May-22 02:33 PM] yang_mills#0000
Do you have the BMPs on Phobos? I could give you 100 PG and 100 EPO, and then you manufacture 250 OFF out of it, and donate for the upkeep on Phobos. Post the buy orders.


[07-May-22 02:36 PM] domicius#0000
OK. I'll post ads as soon as the game is up again


[07-May-22 02:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
Actually I could give you 200 PG and 200 EPO for 500 OFF, if you agree.


[07-May-22 02:37 PM] domicius#0000
I have no idea how long it takes it make, but sure, that's fine.


[07-May-22 02:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
With 80 % efficiency it takes in total 2 days 12 h with one BMP. With your 5 BMPs it should be very fast.

Actually, according to my spreadsheet, it would be enough to provide 2 materials out of 3 for the infirmary. We provide OFF, and the reserve of STR is full. So we don't need to provide TUB to INF. TUB could be used for the university instead.

20 HOG to Phobos ART.


[30-May-22 05:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape @insensless72 @allocater @namthorn I can build an EDM on Phobos. But to start the production of MHP and HOG (needed for the upkeep of ART), I would need the inputs. Does anyone produce PCB, TRA, DCS, HD or NG? PCB and DCS are particularly important, because those cannot be purchased on the CX in meaningful quantities.


[30-May-22 05:49 PM] namthorn#0000
I can make some NG, takes a while though, how much are you after per week?


[30-May-22 05:51 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would say 12 NG per week, provided someone could also supply 12 DCS per week. Without DCS it's all pointless.


[30-May-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000
Oh I can easily supply that.


[30-May-22 05:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
Great. Do you know who runs a 3D printer in the corp?

Awesome. Id like to order 8 LFP pre-emptively xD


[30-May-22 06:16 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also I would like to know whether there is demand for SCN in the corp.


[30-May-22 06:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It used to be Markymark. We will need a few


[30-May-22 06:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Our once-per-week ship builds require at least 1-2 PPF


[31-May-22 01:29 AM] allocater#0000
I can do PCB, TRA and HD


[31-May-22 01:57 AM] yang_mills#0000
Great then. With PCB and TRA I can launch the production of MHP. Are you able to provide 4-5 PCB and TRA per day?

@everyone I would like to trial a different system with the planet contributions, starting with Phobos.


[25-Jun-22 01:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For those who regularly work on the POPI, please check the main shared spreadsheet for a newly added tab/sheet. This is my attempt to project costs and total demand for Phobos infrastructure


[25-Jun-22 01:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and everyone else, of course you are welcome to take a look and see if you want a peice of the pie üòÑ


[25-Jun-22 01:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The nature of POPI is that not everything is economically feasible to supply. I have tried to label these items in red on the total costs column. questions, comments, and price disputes welcome


[25-Jun-22 01:41 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Is there a way maybe we can note which items we're interested in helping with? For example I will consistently contribute OFF and TUB but never DW/RAT (because I don't make it and need it for my own bases!)


[25-Jun-22 01:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
I can supply the MCG, and part of the MHP and HOG. And also the PE, but most of the time this one is covered by Mikal.


[25-Jun-22 01:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills @yjhasaday I will make another column(s) to show supply commitments


[25-Jun-22 01:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am thinking just a total, and we maintain text notes attached to the cells

Sorry Phobos, since getting governorship on Nike I have been focused on its infrastructure upkeep but it appears Phobos is in dire need! I guess that's also because DLR left the game.

@yang_mills I'm helping with what I can but I don't make any of the library/art gallery stuff, do you usually buy that stuff? I can take a turn to buy it but do I just buy off the market or do we have a reliable supplier? I'm willing to spend whatever money necessary to fix this - I've just never done these items before, I don't even know what half of them are lol

I added the following to SST
1000 DW
200 OFF (all I have right now but I'm bringing in some more EPO to start making this again)
200 SUN
And I have 900 TUB on the way. 

@churavis are you going to govern Phobos through Zombie DLR? We may need the odd kick from you when upkeep is fading (I haven't checked on it in weeks). The university is completely empty right now and I don't want OOG reputation to take a hit üò¨

[11-Aug-22 11:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
I produce TUB, but not enough for the UNI. Pehpas @namthorn has more TUB. I can produce some OFF. I also produce HOG, but right now I am waiting for the inputs from @allocater. @domicius should be able to produce SOI. We need someone to produce FOD. Also, I don't have enough DW and RAT to contribute. I did it now because it was an emergency. What we can do is to create a fund and give it to someone who will then manage the upkeep of @Phobos . Ideally this person would become the governor at the next elections. I won't do it because actually managing Phobos takes too much time. But I can contribute 500 K AIC to the fund.


[11-Aug-22 11:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
Essentially the corp is rich enough to upkeep Phobos, but we need to find someone who will sacrifice some of his time to manage the whole stuff.

I've been avoiding making SUN for the QJ-650c SST. Just cause they use so much carbon. Are they sort of a last-ditch item? Safety there is a little low,  but I've got a second SST being shipped there now


[24-Aug-22 01:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, SUN is expensive because of the carbon. We would better upgrade the SST on QJ-650c. But Phobos needs and deserves SUN.

I have an idea. How about we also post our contributions into planet chat? Easy way to drive some visibility and transparencies into the work we do.


[24-Oct-22 04:27 PM] churavis#0000
People might get annoyed at all the messages, maybe on the weekend the governor can just tally everything together?


[24-Oct-22 04:28 PM] domicius#0000
There's no chatter on Phobos chat, for example


[24-Oct-22 04:28 PM] domicius#0000
But anything works.


[24-Oct-22 04:29 PM] churavis#0000
It wouldn't be too hard to add prices to all the products and give a total monetary value as well


[24-Oct-22 04:30 PM] churavis#0000
It would be a little extra work so we could make it optional for each governor based on whether they think they need the pr boost or not.

One takeaway from the Nike and Katoa debacles is that people really like to see spreadsheets, or some kind of accounting


[24-Oct-22 05:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
kind of a drag to burden the governors further with that though. ü§∑


[24-Oct-22 05:43 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Haha I'm certainly not making another spreadsheet for it. That's why I asked for anyone who may be more familiar with the math


[24-Oct-22 05:49 PM] churavis#0000
I can make the spreadsheet for everyone else to use


[24-Oct-22 05:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think if we enter (or import) the current population numbers, we can calculate the number of SSTs needed for 100% safety, etc.


[24-Oct-22 06:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
So, one of the things bobemor did (Deimos governor) is requested permission to share my consumables contract with the population of Deimos (I sell him 2k DW per week). I don't see anywhere that he actually did it, but I think he was trying to satisfy the same concerns.


[24-Oct-22 06:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
He even had me put Deimos in the "Customer Information" section: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFjM-NIJe6xI1y-ixOxxXA_KRROza8PoTm7Teq22_6A/edit?usp=sharing

I could work up something like that for the planets we govern. Wouldn't necessarily have to do a cash exchange for the stuff we provide, but would put some $$ numbers down that show the cost.

[25-Oct-22 11:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
A governor can "inactivate" some buildings in order to reduce the upkeep spending of them


[25-Oct-22 11:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
and the needs provided by that building are correspondingly reduced


[25-Oct-22 11:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's generally pretty uncommon... easier to just use more of the cheaper resource and skip the higher level one if something is overproducing


[25-Oct-22 11:49 PM] dehzhas#0000

[25-Oct-22 11:51 PM] dehzhas#0000

[25-Oct-22 11:52 PM] dehzhas#0000
The goal would be to increase Tech and Eng a bit to fill the open jobs? A couple ways to do that, but to keep them around, you would want to get the happiness between 50-70%


[25-Oct-22 11:53 PM] dehzhas#0000
So you might supply a bit more or less depending on where you want the population to shift (and also run a program to similar effect)?

So education rate increases with happiness. And migration out happens at 50%.  Those are pretty good education numbers, really. But pretty low happiness.


[25-Oct-22 11:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Each need is capped by the need to the left of it. So with that low safety, nothing else can really improve above that.

It's annoying but you'll essentially be "paying" for the high pioneer count in order to ultimately improve the engineers.


[25-Oct-22 11:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pioneers consume small amounts of comfort and culture... but with the way they are capped, you still gotta get them a lot of safety. And I don't really think there's a great way to decrease pioneer count specifically


[25-Oct-22 11:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've seen some planets with 40% unemployment, so Nike is pretty even in that regard

As far as I understand it, this is a pyramid structure, and the foundation needs to be solid if the high-level population is to grow steadily.

so if we would need only scientists we would have to build all the kinds of POPI?


[26-Oct-22 02:16 AM] dehzhas#0000
Looks like it, you could theoretically tune it to educate them and migrate the higher end in much more quickly, but the lower foundations would have to be there that would naturally bring in the lower POPI types.

Yes, Phobos does need the extra safety, more levels of SST would be super expensive

I think it's time to lower Nike's infrastructure maintenance level. I have provided a lot of maintenance products, which are enough for a month. The latest population report shows that it will soon make up all the population gaps, and even lead to unemployment. It would be a waste to provide a lot of maintenance products.


[27-Nov-22 05:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
@Nike


[27-Nov-22 05:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe it's enough to adjust to one or two varieties of maintenance products, plus festivals.

On a fresh extraction planet just needing Pioneers, do you need any infrastructure to keep growing the population of just those Pios?


[08-Dec-22 02:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
You didn't need to build it when you first colonized it, but if you have a larger population, you will, because happiness is not enough.


[08-Dec-22 02:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
When you first colonized, there was a happiness reward.

The development team should really limit the naming right. Too many people have no base and haven't played for a long time, and directly give a bad name to the planet that others have been running for a long time.

Right. I guess I meant: If you want to maintain high tier workers, you have to dump so much into upkeep that the lower tiers go crazy... You get a ton of low tier workers who are unhappy because they are unemployed... but even the unemployed settlers use up space in the INF

because you need that stuff yes?


[26-Aug-23 06:20 PM] churavis#0000
You can send me a shipping contract and I'll get it there within a few days and then you can donate it and get the credit or you can sell it to me and I'll get the credit, it's up to you.


[26-Aug-23 06:21 PM] fremen45#0000
how do the Credits work?


[26-Aug-23 06:23 PM] churavis#0000
You donate it and then note it here. The corp will see what you did on this channel and everyone else will see on the page for the infrastructure building or when I thank you in a week at the nearing of the next COGC upkeep period. It's just social credit, nothing tangible


[26-Aug-23 06:26 PM] fremen45#0000
alright I'll donate the TUB and 4 of the UTS as those things are fairly expensive. if your willing to buy the other 6 off of me?


[26-Aug-23 06:26 PM] churavis#0000
Sure, send me the contracts


[26-Aug-23 06:27 PM] fremen45#0000
what's the rate for Shipping contracts?


[26-Aug-23 06:28 PM] churavis#0000
If it's for shipping upkeep donations to Phobos then it's free. I usually have extra shipping capacity on the routes they'll take anyways so it's no burden

I built both of these about 2 weeks ago, but since I keep topping up the consumables, I think it resets? Does that mean this list would just keep resetting endlessly and keep showing the mats used for the builds, even weeks/months later? Surely not.

It'd be good to pick folks brains over what they are thinking of doing on reimbursement rates. I've not really figured out what to do yet. Was going to wait until it was obvious what the income is first before doing payouts anyway.

We could talk about everything on the general channel, it's just that everything would get buried. The point of multiple channels is so that nothing important gets buried by less important and unrelated chatter.

off topic stuff would be cool.  somewhere to post your friend codes in Pokemon Go?  lol


[03-Jul-24 09:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a unique channel for coordinating upkeep materials would be handy. A lot of the mats are very specific and keeping that stuff somewhere it won't get buried would be useful

Following up on @katinga  question in the new channel.

http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_2024-07-04_10-55-41.png

How to nudge happiness above 70%.

So on this planet you've got no pioneer migration because the happiness is between 50% and 70%. If you want more pioneers, you can boost that happiness. Look at the needs and see that safety and health are at 67% and 34%. For a small planet like this with low tier workers, you can just boost those two up towards 100% and the happiness will follow

And I can answer specifics once you've got it started


[04-Jul-24 11:02 AM] katinga#0000
one of the problems that I have is that staring at white sheets literally hurts me.  I run dark modes on anything that offers it for a reason.  I have gamer goggles somewhere


[04-Jul-24 11:10 AM] katinga#0000
I am working on getting the upkeeps in place on Rom C and Romulus.  it takes time to move stuff out there


[04-Jul-24 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm there's apparently a chrome feature that can switch on dark mode in google sheets, but it's sort of experimental


[04-Jul-24 11:10 AM] katinga#0000
I am not using Chrome


[04-Jul-24 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah me either üòÜ


[04-Jul-24 11:11 AM] katinga#0000
I use FF

[04-Jul-24 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
and it actually looks pretty decent with the governor sheet


[04-Jul-24 11:16 AM] katinga#0000
Upkeep will influence the Need Fulfillment, won't it?  Once I get the infirmary all the bandaids and aspirin it needs, that health percentage should go up


[04-Jul-24 11:20 AM] katinga#0000
Ahhh... dark mode bliss


[04-Jul-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, so with QJ-382g's population to get to 100% safety you need 2336 safety and for 100% health, it's 1430 health. With one small building each you can make 3100, so you don't need more buildings to achieve that.

[04-Jul-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
So if you just supply DW and OFF in the SST and only OFF in the INF, you will make 2266 safety and 1433 health:

[04-Jul-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's 97% and 100.17% respectively, which is about as close to perfect as you can get


[04-Jul-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you fill all 6, you get 132% and 216% and the excess is lost


[04-Jul-24 11:22 AM] katinga#0000
We've got the OFF in the Infirmary now.  I supplied some.  another player actually filled the Reserve


[04-Jul-24 11:23 AM] katinga#0000
on Romulus


[04-Jul-24 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
With safety and health at 100%, your "no unemlpoyment happiness" will be 90% for pioneers and 84% for settlers, 64% for techs, etc


[04-Jul-24 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you want to increase that, you can supply comfort and the other need types


[04-Jul-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
So pioneers are pretty dang happy with just safety and health


[04-Jul-24 11:25 AM] katinga#0000
I just implemented some programs as governor, as well.  What I also need, though, is more players to put bases on Romulus.  C and Remus, too, eventually


[04-Jul-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Generally a good rule of thumb is to keep a planet around 10% unemployment. It's enough buffer to absorb a new base here and there without going too overboard paying for unemployed workers. You can aim higher if you know a lot of new bases are coming though


[04-Jul-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
A good way to rope people in is to have bases predesigned in prunplanner so you can say "Hey come build this exact base on this planet". People seem to like that


[04-Jul-24 11:26 AM] katinga#0000
the prunplanner hates me


[04-Jul-24 11:36 AM] katinga#0000
yep!  it still hates me!

Yep, you kinda have to guess what is going on if you have a partial week


[04-Jul-24 12:46 PM] katinga#0000
some of the changes I made on Romulus should hit next week

What I would like to do is to be able to offer sponsorships for new bases on Romulus, and the other 2 planets once they come online.  But that would only be for OOG members.  I am not sure how to go about that


[05-Jul-24 10:19 AM] katinga#0000
What do settlers care about?

[05-Jul-24 10:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly safety and health (since life support is usually free)


[05-Jul-24 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
But if you have a big planet like Phobo, where you also want a high tech pop, the pioners actually end up eating a lot of comfort, culture and education. 100k PIOs stealing it from your 5k scientists


[05-Jul-24 10:23 AM] katinga#0000
well, it seems to make sense to me that Engineers and Scientists wouldn't value safety as much.  Engineers are always licking the warp core and scientists are blowing up the labs!

[06-Jul-24 10:00 AM] akyantor#0000
What are folks thinking of doing in relation to payout for goods? Are people pricing to bid/ask/avg market prices, or pinning to something closer to internal corp prices?


[06-Jul-24 10:07 AM] akyantor#0000
I was leaning initially towards pinning to something close to market ask, as some fair reflection of the market value of the goods. That said, most folks who'd bother to provide goods are probably making it quite a bit below that cost, so may result in unnecessarily inflated taxes to cover upkeep at that level.


[06-Jul-24 11:13 AM] tuffyless#0000
I've been paying out at avg CX price on 110a.  
TBD if is sustainable though for CoGC, SST, and INF.


[06-Jul-24 11:13 AM] tuffyless#0000
and cannot payout too close to reelection :\

[06-Jul-24 11:14 AM] akyantor#0000
I've been looking at weekly income, and if you go at market rates... taxes will definitely have to go up on WU-070a


[06-Jul-24 11:14 AM] akyantor#0000
Oh, that's not ideal


[06-Jul-24 11:15 AM] tuffyless#0000
guess it's a mechanism to prevent the emptying of coffers before a new administration comes in.


[06-Jul-24 11:19 AM] akyantor#0000
My best estimate at the moment has WU-070a running at a 60k a month deficit, assuming you use prices around 5-10% below AI ask.


[06-Jul-24 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm running at somewhere between CX bid and ask


[06-Jul-24 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
depending on the item


[06-Jul-24 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
some of the more boutique ones, like BID or PFE, I run at a margin I determine myself


[06-Jul-24 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
Nike was at a 50% deficit or so, which is about 200k/week negative


[06-Jul-24 11:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
so it's not surprising if raising taxes is required


[06-Jul-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'm mostly dealing with more liquid upkeep goods, much harder for more niche stuff


[06-Jul-24 11:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
I plan on publishing numbers in planet chats to allow for other people to fill COGC if they want


[06-Jul-24 11:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
motions make it pretty easy to calculate


[06-Jul-24 11:24 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'll be doing the same.


[06-Jul-24 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
and since the contributions reset every cycle, that part is also really easy


[06-Jul-24 11:24 AM] akyantor#0000
Wanted to see a full week of income to determine the current income, then was going to share the sheet and rationale for any tax adjustments.


[06-Jul-24 11:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
Do you have any idea about when POPI upkeep contributions reset?


[06-Jul-24 11:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
POPI seems to be a rolling 30 days


[06-Jul-24 11:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
so it's basically useless


[06-Jul-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh okay


[06-Jul-24 11:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
I just posted in behind-the-scenes about that üòÑ


[06-Jul-24 11:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
i imagine with diligent enough record keeping and a fancy enough sheet you could reverse engineer the time of contributions.. but man what a chore that would be


[06-Jul-24 11:30 AM] akyantor#0000
I've just been looking at what the production fees are on various planets... Harmonia must be running a deficit, lowest fees I've spotted yet.


[06-Jul-24 11:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, my answer right now is any POPI are free


[06-Jul-24 11:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
unless I or an MP contribute it


[06-Jul-24 11:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
plus those contributions could disrupt any plans we're trying to do


[06-Jul-24 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
so it might do more harm than good if someone is just tacking excess POPI on top of an already satisfied building


[06-Jul-24 11:31 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, free for all contributions could cause havok on a more complicated planet to run.


[06-Jul-24 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
it would but for the fact the more damaging contributions are also monumentally more expensive to produce


[06-Jul-24 11:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
so no one wants to just waste those... generally


[06-Jul-24 11:32 AM] akyantor#0000
That's fair. Someone less like to throw their money away


[06-Jul-24 11:32 AM] akyantor#0000
Unless they were sure to get a refund


[06-Jul-24 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000

[06-Jul-24 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll let you all read the instructions, but the short version is that it supplies a way to calculate values of upkeep items relative to the cheapest upkeep item for each need.

no thanks ill check it out


[02-Aug-24 09:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Great way to get started


[02-Aug-24 09:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
cool. I think all my best ideas are in there, but lemme know if you have questions


[02-Aug-24 09:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
LB-476 in general is a really good system for CHEM (its in Mor I know, dont hate me)


[02-Aug-24 10:39 AM] akyantor#0000
A planet with mostly either PIO/SET seems like a good place to start. Also that planet has only ever had one governer, so would be easy to get an MP seat if nothing else. That'd enable you to see how it works.


[02-Aug-24 11:30 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We‚Äôll see if I get elected


[05-Aug-24 03:23 PM] mrsmith33#0000
So, after the motion for workforce program is passed, you also need to fulfill contract ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[05-Aug-24 03:27 PM] mrsmith33#0000
And I'm late by 40mins to pass it for the POPR


[05-Aug-24 03:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the weird thing is there doesn't seem to be a limit to how many you can pass. You can store up paid ones for later. Which is weird


[05-Aug-24 03:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I am also not sure what happens if you try to start a program when you already have one active and one queued


[09-Aug-24 03:40 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Do programs run for 7 or 10 days?


[09-Aug-24 04:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
They run for 7 days, they just don't necessarily start and end the same time the popi reports do


[11-Aug-24 03:27 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Anyone know why the base establishment fee on my planet can‚Äôt be higher than 20k?


[11-Aug-24 03:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs in faction space?


[11-Aug-24 03:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs why


[12-Aug-24 04:36 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Now that's the POPR

No problem. Just wanted to have your back given how difficult some have been with even small misses. üòÄ

[14-Aug-24 12:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
Does anyone have the MCG and PE? If not, I can run it over from Thalassa B


[14-Aug-24 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Uhh I probably have some???


[14-Aug-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000

I kind of forget which Thalassa planet I have


[24-Aug-24 09:29 AM] akyantor#0000
Is there a resource somewhere that shows how much each upgrade level costs for popi buildings?


[24-Aug-24 09:31 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm planning to upgrade the warehouse on Hyalos, and realised I need two levels to mean anything, but you can't see how much more than one upgrade costs in game. :S

Great, thanks.

Yeah, The ones that don't upgrade the count always cost the same as the previous


[24-Aug-24 10:56 AM] akyantor#0000
Good tip


[24-Aug-24 03:56 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
what are you governors using the revenue of a planet for?


[24-Aug-24 03:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Making me richer


[24-Aug-24 03:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Jk


[24-Aug-24 03:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
POPI mats


[24-Aug-24 03:57 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, my planet (Hyalos) is pretty budget neutral for popi upkeep. Will increase the taxes a bit soon to create an infra upgrade buffer.


[24-Aug-24 03:59 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i intend to use it for upgrading the warehouse. but someone dislikes spending 900k on this upgrade.

saying players should pay for it on their own. but in a way they do through the production fees. ü§î


[24-Aug-24 03:59 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, it's for community benefit


[24-Aug-24 04:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
who says that? I don't want to waste permit and money for CM just to buy something that a planet produces. Warehouses are so good


[24-Aug-24 04:01 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
our "friend" rise of filth says so.


[24-Aug-24 04:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
Ah I see


[24-Aug-24 04:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
maybe he can put that huge tax surplus on Phobos to work building warehouses everywhere else üòõ


[24-Aug-24 04:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
Do we have moments when people buy OFF from CX? If yes I can allocate some of my production to that Since I am overproducing on other stuff


[24-Aug-24 04:05 PM] akyantor#0000
It's not particularly extravagant for such a populated planet. If there's demand, why not. It's not like it'll need maintenance or upkeep once you've built the upgrade. It's a one off.

[24-Aug-24 04:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I tend to use a WAR on norwick pretty frequently to keep excess crops that I'm not using at the moment (like MUS from auctions here) - it helps keep track of what to resupply and what not to üòÑ


[24-Aug-24 06:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a warehouse is a totally legit use of government funds


[24-Aug-24 06:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
that's bonkers. Warehouses last forever, it's a permanent upgrade that never needs repairs


[24-Aug-24 06:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
like yeah the first upgrade is very cheap, but they do get a little more expensive as you go. I think 2k (4 warehouses available) is a good sweet spot

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[24-Aug-24 06:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
they are a bit of a drag to use compared to STOs, but if you are trading with someone, them being able to buy a 2k warehouse is worth the 900k right there üòõ


[26-Aug-24 10:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
is it intentional by the devs that we use 1/3 of POPI inputs? Feels like economy would have been more diverse if we taxed more and used more inputs. But nobody likes taxes


[26-Aug-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's even lower because we avoid using most of the large POPI buildings, only use the SST, not the drone post


[26-Aug-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
They are a lot more work to make, more expensive, and provide drastically less safety per $ than just putting in DW


[26-Aug-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
I've been asking for a rebalance, but I don't think it's a priority


[26-Aug-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think as a rule, the more interesting / complicated good should provide more upkeep per dollar

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[26-Aug-24 11:20 AM] marat_sh#0000
Or less consumption


[26-Aug-24 11:20 AM] marat_sh#0000
Be on par with cost with lower tier items


[26-Aug-24 11:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
Maybe in the future üôè


[03-Sep-24 09:12 AM] marat_sh#0000
@uncle_leslie69 sorry for the ping... Are there any plans on improving warehouse on ANT II g to lvl 3? if yes how soon?

@uncle_leslie69 If you're out at the mo, are you going to be able to fill the COGC on 759g, or is your MP partner handling it (xepiov)?


[06-Sep-24 12:12 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I‚Äôll look at filling it today or tomorrow in the meantime


[06-Sep-24 12:12 PM] akyantor#0000

[10-Sep-24 06:15 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Hey, so im governing LB-476c as a way to get a feel for it and someone just set down a base and is asking for TEC


[10-Sep-24 06:15 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Appart from running a program, I should probably build up some infrastrucre to support them?


[10-Sep-24 07:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah probably tech immigration. If the base shows up next week that'll be good. It's not really viable to build  up pop more than a week in advance if a tier has 100% unemployment


[10-Sep-24 07:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
On planets that you expect to stay small for a long time, I actually like art cafes, since you put some DW in and it'll max comfort AND culture


[10-Sep-24 07:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
but they don't provide enough satisfaction long term, so you'd eventually need a park


[10-Sep-24 07:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah I‚Äôm getting 2 bases this week. One regular PIO/SET which o was focusing on


[10-Sep-24 07:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The other I need to think about more


[12-Sep-24 02:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If anyone can take a look at LB-476c and suggest some next steps I‚Äôd appreciate


[12-Sep-24 02:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Got a real sudden influx and I‚Äôd like to do the best job possible


[12-Sep-24 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh that's a lot of techs. You'll want them to immigrate, so you really want their happiness in the 90%s to close that up. You kinda have two choices. Add a ACA (which is a bunch of rfabs), or a PAR and a ART, which is probably cheaper. The PAR you can just fill the DW. if you build an ART I guess put UTS in it probably ( you can check the math on the cheapest item)


[12-Sep-24 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
You miiight need another SST, it's probably cost effective to add one


[12-Sep-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah another SST since I'm assuming DW and OFF was full last week too.


[12-Sep-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can run tech immigration, it's probably more effective than Festival 3, but you can check that in the gov helper sheet


[12-Sep-24 02:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The planet is poor is shit too‚Ä¶ 125k in the bank


[12-Sep-24 02:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
At least copious suggested paying like 100k for programs but the infrastructure is lacking as well


[12-Sep-24 02:43 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I don't know that you can sustain the TECH pop without infrastructure


[12-Sep-24 02:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Juste looking at the mats an ACA must be in the 1mil+ range


[12-Sep-24 02:44 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Well that‚Äôs going to be some good gov experience


[12-Sep-24 02:46 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I might just ask Copious to pay for it, that‚Äôs outside of what I consider my gov mandate


[12-Sep-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just a PAR is pretty cheap


[12-Sep-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
IF the ACA is that high, go PAR or amybe PAR + ART


[12-Sep-24 03:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Got it thanks


[22-Sep-24 02:59 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm starting to question the rationality of running an open ledger (as I have at https://ingenious.foo/hyalos). Not sure if anyone looks at it, and it's feeling problematic from an overhead perspective as I pick up responsibility for more planets. I ended up an MP on SE-648c, and now likely to end up governor on ZV-759g. Do folks think it's worth going to the additional effort on the smaller planets?


[22-Sep-24 05:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think generally people don‚Äôt care on smaller planet. The numbers tend to be pretty small anyway. I think for something the size of Phobos or Malahat it‚Äôs nice.


[22-Sep-24 05:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Although I think most planets don‚Äôt seem to have a public ledger, including the big ones.


[22-Sep-24 07:31 PM] exeler#0000
Is this record keeping being done manually? Any opportunities for some automation or tools that make it easier?

I haven't added anything to the bot in a bit, I wonder if there's anything that could be done with it to make governance less of a chore :think:


[23-Sep-24 01:55 AM] akyantor#0000
It‚Äôs possible. At the moment it‚Äôs fairly manual just update the ledger each time I push materials into a planet. I‚Äôm not really sure what automation would be possible. May have to look at the FIO APIs and see if there‚Äôs a way to see who submitted upkeep goods.


[23-Sep-24 09:42 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I keep an open ledger for Nascent, but that is the 5th most populous planet in Antares space.  I am not bothering on KI-401d

Anyone else noticed a drop out of folks participating in volunteering in governing/politics? I've just had moon sugar travels drop out from looking after SE-648c, and seems like the number of votes is generally down too, really thin on smaller planets.


[21-Oct-24 05:52 PM] hernanduer#0000

Got my own beef w/ Rise but it's not only him.
He's the head of it;  it's his puppets too.  
His puppets that'll come defend him to-the-death day after day in the chats, even if he were to say grass that is blue.
Are any of his brainwashed puppets stepping up to fill any gaps?
That's not meant to be a rhetorical question.

I think in general there has been too much focus on efficiency rather than consistency of maintaining upkeep. I'd rather that elected folks were motivated, including financially, to keep a planet going than try to run things on a razor margin.


[22-Oct-24 07:37 AM] akyantor#0000
It's a bit of a thankless task at it stands, with half of folks not really understanding what it involves, and the other half not really caring. :S


[22-Oct-24 09:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I've stopped looking at chats unless any are DMs


[22-Oct-24 09:42 AM] hernanduer#0000

[22-Oct-24 09:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
the other ones are basically useless


[22-Oct-24 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
There was an appetite for a salary in the Malahat survey, but I haven't done one, because I think the loud complainers will be loud. So it's generally pretty thankless, and no way to really make a profit with the current mechanics. 

And rise is running them at what must be a loss so.... hard to want to step in on that

I think the sections about money disappearing into the void are outdated because of the government account right?

It does create a bit of a faff to change contexts. I suspect they chose to do it this way as it opens the door to having you be able to do more via the alternative context in the future.


[02-Nov-24 10:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
And they've hinted at corporations following some similar context in the future as well


[02-Nov-24 10:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
Probably whenever they add gateways to corps


[02-Nov-24 07:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect next up is the "system infrastructure", since the gateways are "planet infrastructure". Not really sure what they have planned there, but if we are lucky, it will include corp ownership for other assets... and thus a corp context too.


[09-Nov-24 04:17 PM] akyantor#0000
@archielvahr Did a plan get agreed for Vulcan with SFScorpio? I volunteered to pay for another immigration programme to help sort out the ENG population in planetary chat, but have had no response.


[09-Nov-24 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Great question


[09-Nov-24 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Rise was just gonna add a bunch of buildings


[09-Nov-24 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh dang I missed his message (in vulcan chat)


[09-Nov-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sent him a message via discord about both the immigration project and also the potential upgrades. I'll remind rise about it too


[09-Nov-24 04:26 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok cool, didn't want to further complicate things by turning a 3 way into a 4 way discussion. üòõ


[09-Nov-24 04:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heh reminders are always helpful for me


[06-Dec-24 05:32 AM] turlorn_angren#0000
on norwick the unemployment rate for pioneers is at 8,8% while the workforce reserve pool is at 10%.

does this negatively impact the availability and distribution of pioneers?

should the unemployment rate be above 10% if i want new players to have access to more pioneers?


[06-Dec-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nah, the workforce reserve pool mechanic just allows for midweek assignment of workers. It doesn't factor into the worker assignment that happens at the end of the POPI cycle.


[06-Dec-24 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
With 56000 pioneers, and 10% unemployment, that means A new base would immediately have access to 560 PIO (plus the 200 from starting a base) and then get the rest on the popi cycle


[06-Dec-24 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
For a planet that size it's a plenty large buffer


[06-Dec-24 02:41 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i see. so it is ok to let the workers fill up over time.


[06-Dec-24 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, no matter what your planet has, you can't be sure people will fill up from the reserve, basically they gotta wait for a POPI

Did I understand this correctly: feeding more MAT's into SS and INF will increase the happiness level, but it does not matter if the happiness level is 70% or 100%. The POP's will not migrate faster for it, right?


[31-Jan-25 10:04 AM] bookliko#0000
Second question: how long does a program last? Will kicking it off use its effect on one POP report only?


[31-Jan-25 10:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
The happiness percentage affects two things: Migration for PIOs and SETs, and education rate for the higher tiers. It works differently for both of those.


[31-Jan-25 10:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
For migration 50% to 70% is the same, but you get a boost above 70%


[31-Jan-25 10:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
The rest of those details you better get from here, cause it's lengthy:

Programs last one week, and I think they take effect on the pop report the week after they started.


[31-Jan-25 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
So you can sneak one in at the end of a report and it works


[31-Jan-25 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
You can queue up one that will start immediately after the current one


[31-Jan-25 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly the details are a little fuzzy, but I operate under those assumptions


[31-Jan-25 10:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it only ever affects one report

Rodger! For keeping it stable the % does not matter, but for growth is scales linear.

[03-Feb-25 05:26 PM] bookliko#0000
I am in need of advice: so caskman invested 1.300.000 worth of MAT's (CX @ ask) into an ADM, SS upgrade and POPI mats. (ZV-307g)
Current income is 1100 per day. I already increased the taxes to triple that. Costs are currently about 1000. 
My aim is to grow the PIO and SET to facilitate all current 6 bases to expand to max production, so revenue will go up. 
It will take 3 to 4 POP reports to get to maybe 7500 income per day (based on 6 full bases). Sounds like a long time to get ROI on caskman's investment. 
Now caskman did go in to hot: building the SS level with no benefit to POP growth and wasting bunch of MAT's for marginal extra growth rate.  But at the least the ADM worth 840.000 should be covered as some point. 
To be fair, caskman is not asking for anything, but I am insisting the planet should run without charity. 
In the long term the bases will increase and all will be well. I am looking for advice on strategies how to get the planet "dept fee" within the 4 week GOV term. Currently cash reserves: 235.000


[03-Feb-25 05:37 PM] bookliko#0000
One strategy I am considering is to leverage my own Bfab, Lfab and POPI consumables production at a discount rate compared to CX. So to calculate with 85% of bid for the investment.


[03-Feb-25 05:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those kind of upgrades are common for experienced players to do without an expectation of returns. I usually consider things like ADMs, COGCs, and the first few POPI buildings to be a sunk cost that will never be directly returned

Caskman is also governor of Harmonia which probably has a pretty good cash reserve

A bit of a random question, but does anyone make HAB? Market looks thin.


[14-Feb-25 04:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Not really, but I have UPF, so could make some in the future. I guess I need to make them in batches of 5, for PAR


[14-Feb-25 04:30 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I may upgrade from 1 UPF to 6 UPF at some point


[14-Feb-25 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm considering a PAR upgrade on SE-648c in order to increase the satisfaction for the TECH given the increased demand there. I'd need 6, which are available on the market.


[14-Feb-25 04:32 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess it's bound to be a thin market as there's not consistent recurring demand, only when someone wants to upgrade or build a popi that requires them,


[14-Feb-25 04:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I make HABs when Tanda in ADI asks me to


[14-Feb-25 04:35 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd be interested in a price for 6. What would you normally price them at?


[14-Feb-25 04:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Depends


[14-Feb-25 04:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I made 15 of them and Tanda bought and gave me the materials and I just charged 300k for the UPF usage


[14-Feb-25 04:36 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah, fair enough. Not a straight purhcase.


[14-Feb-25 04:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But I can do either


[14-Feb-25 04:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôll get you a price per unit for comparison if you want


[14-Feb-25 04:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
80k/u to buy?


[14-Feb-25 04:44 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that'd be fine.


[14-Feb-25 04:47 PM] akyantor#0000
If you want I can send a long dated contract to provide the funds up front, if you're buying some of the components.


[14-Feb-25 04:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
nah


[14-Feb-25 04:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
uh ship arrives in 12 or so hours


[14-Feb-25 04:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
then it will take 1day 8 hours to make


[14-Feb-25 04:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and then 12 or so hours to get back to ANT


[14-Feb-25 04:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so 4 day cont is fine


[14-Feb-25 04:48 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, cool. I'd ideally want to get them to the planet before the next popr, but that's not until next Friday now, so plenty of time.


[14-Feb-25 04:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
what planet? I could deliver them there maybe


[14-Feb-25 04:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh se-648c

Either ANT or SE-648c.

A pitch:

Looking at: 
1) the recent discussion on governing style 
2) OOG members stepping up to fill the recent gov vacuum 
3) the current branding of OOG 
I have a proposal: 
To write up a section on the OOG website about governing styles. (Yes, I am happy to contribute to the writing)

Appreciating that OOG does not have a central policy, I do believe it would send a strong/transparent message to write up a couple governing styles and their implications. Essentially create a a-la-carte menu of governing styles. 
Any governor or candidate could than very easily refer to the style they are planning on utilizing when pitching for the job. 
A simple URL in chat would provide all the info a voter might need to know. Equally as an answer to complaining players. 

This would have a couple of advantages and knock-on affects: 
-the OOG governors would spend less time explaining/discussing why they do what they do
-OOG would strengthen their image as "premier ANT Corp"
-soft justification for OOG filling in the current vacuum 
-Increased voting pull
-Increased transparency 
-forcing non-OOG governors to relate to the OOG standards 
-lowering the bar for newer players to take up a commission 
-more visits on OOG website and thus recruitment pull 
-insert aspect I have not taught about 
-insert risks that my optimistic brain is blind to


[18-Feb-25 08:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I like this a lot! It will be great to have more documents out there from more OOG folks, and my current guide is pretty out of date. And since I am doing more gateway stuff and less governing, having more voices there will be very helpful

[19-Feb-25 03:33 AM] evov#0000
My article ->
Workers have needs. Fill them, but anything over 100% gets wasted.
This makes workers happy, but never more than 100% happy, any extra happiness gets wasted.
Don't 100% fill population infrastructure buildings unless you need 100% of the fulfilment it provides.
Keep running costs low by avoiding waste.

I'm going to see if I can run Deimos without SOI, which is both heavy and expensive. I'm pretty sure Rise/Paris must have been supplying a bunch of vertically integrated gov upkeep goods to operate it at the current tax levels. It's not sustainable if you're paying market rates. :S

[16-Mar-25 04:39 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I lean towards making the planet upkeep working at CX prices... and buying via the CX wherever possible, as it creates more transparency and opportunity for anyone to potentially produce to support planets. If it's all via dark markets, then unless you're in one of the groups supporting a planet then it's harder to participate.


[16-Mar-25 05:30 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, it doesn't even look like it was close to market costs.

@neth_havoc @tyrandia Vulcan CoGC on strike


[05-Apr-25 01:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also, I think the planet needs some engineer love, probably something to get the happiness above 50%. A festival would be a good quick fix


[05-Apr-25 01:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I got messaged that someone wants to put down a bunch of ASMs, so some growth on engineers would be good


[05-Apr-25 06:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Vulcan seems really low on POPI buildings and actually doesn't have a full culture building. It probably needs a fair bit of building upgrades. If we add one ART and fill two mats in it, we can get that culture up a bit.  For 6 safety stations, it's right on the edge of where you'd want to fill two mats- if you want the safety above 70%. Might be nice to up the INFs too to make better use of the cheap OFF upkeep. 

The big goal here is to stop the engineer loss since they are expensive to get back. And recently we were running a lot of engineer immigration jobs there. So you can lose those 50 engineers pretty fast even at 40% happiness. 

Eyaoo started a Festival 3, and that's a good call, it'll be very helpful in stopping those losses.

I put together a Governor Helper for Vulcan, and I put in some mat suggestions for cheap upkeep. It'll need some tweaks from what I listed, depending which direction you all want to take.

[05-Apr-25 06:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
My recommendation is probably to bump up the infrastructure levels to get the exact amounts you want to get engineers solidly above 50% happiness. Then Phobos can give grants for the POPI infrastructure. I think everyone is very onboard with how important Vulcan is for metallurgy and ASMs since Deimos is generally full


[07-Apr-25 09:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @martin1194  can you start a Festival 3 on Electronica please?


[07-Apr-25 09:19 AM] martin1194#0000
umm. I am not governor, I will try to let them vote YES on festival 3


[07-Apr-25 09:20 AM] martin1194#0000
governor always can get "YES" if make a new motions.  ü§£


[07-Apr-25 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah if the governor is away, the motion will pass


[07-Apr-25 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think people have been trying to contact the governor and have not succeeded  yet


[07-Apr-25 09:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah I see the motion, don't forget to vote for it yourself, so it will pass


[07-Apr-25 10:02 AM] martin1194#0000
He is not away but his style is don't using any festival

[12-Apr-25 07:36 PM] evov#0000
Add me to the list. I've got issues with a number of planets in the region.

{Reactions}
ü´° 

[12-Apr-25 07:37 PM] evov#0000
Nike, Astraeus, Agamemnon, Griffonstone are big issues. Heph is also a concern. I'd also keep an eye on Deimos.


[12-Apr-25 07:45 PM] evov#0000
When I'm experiencing pop drops of high teir workers on a quarter of the ANT planets I'm on that I don't run myself, it points to something more than simple one off mistakes. I'm sure they're all fixable issues, but this isn't the first time the ANT region has seen these issues, so it might be worth thinking about what underlying issues might be driving these outcomes.


[12-Apr-25 07:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair I have had multiple griffonstone pop drops. I just wasn't aware of any other ones


[12-Apr-25 07:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I usually don't really look at the governance of planets I don't govern


[12-Apr-25 07:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and I'm not on a lot of those planets


[12-Apr-25 08:03 PM] evov#0000
I've lost -
7 Sci on Heph
14 Engineers on Astraeus
23 Engineers on Griffonstone
6 Engineers on Nike

The governance of Agamemnon is at a point where I'll probably get pop filled faster if I just start a brand new planet and build it up from nothing.

If we get a pop drop on Deimos, a planet that really should be something of a "flagship" for the ANT region, it will speak very poorly of our region's ability to run planets.

I'm certain we can do better than this, and the Antarean population deserve better imo.


[12-Apr-25 08:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No yeah I'm not arguing by any means, just trying to understand
Do you think that the struggles with Governance is because of the lack of POPI inputs, I have noticed that the CXs for those are rather bare more so than before


[12-Apr-25 08:08 PM] evov#0000
I'm not sure exactly what the problem is. Broadly speaking, I'd break down these things into 2 parts, 1. Intent. 2. Execution.

What are the gov's "trying" to do?
How well are they achieving what they're aiming for?

Without knowing what they're aiming to do, it's hard to really judge where the issue is, which makes it hard to know the best way to correct the issue/behavior.


[12-Apr-25 08:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Valid assessment


[12-Apr-25 08:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
thanks for your input üòÑ


[13-Apr-25 01:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I can come back to this tomorrow in more detail, but usually things like this happen just as a result of burnout, not some sort of intentional plan. And then the easy mats get filled and tougher stuff like comfort and culture fall behind, because it's a drag to get those items in.


[13-Apr-25 04:14 AM] evov#0000
If it was isolated issues, one planet here or there, one week down then back to normal, it wouldn't be a reason for concern. But I'm seeing many planets failing over many weeks. The only thing that makes sense is that Gov's are trying to keep expenses / taxes as low as possible. Saving $1 in taxes for people while costing them $100's in lost productivity.


[13-Apr-25 05:42 AM] martin1194#0000
If there anyone using PRUNNER for goverment management


[13-Apr-25 05:43 AM] martin1194#0000
Please careful about the report number


[13-Apr-25 05:43 AM] martin1194#0000
Nike doesn't match between PRUNNER and game


[13-Apr-25 05:56 AM] evov#0000
If lots of people are using the same tool and the tool is faulty, it would make sense. Maybe we need to remind everyone to check the in game numbers.


[13-Apr-25 05:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Note that the prunner and prun planner are two different tools


[13-Apr-25 06:05 AM] martin1194#0000

[13-Apr-25 07:44 AM] martin1194#0000
@neth_havoc GRIFF under your control.
Astraeus is under mine but no any open job.
Heph no any open job too.

[13-Apr-25 08:07 AM] evov#0000
The unemployment number gets shown before it updates the current week's changes. There was 10.9% unemployment, then 49 engineers decided to leave because they've been less than 50% happiness for like 7 weeks in a row. So now, even though it says 10.9% unemployment, you're actually missing about 30.


[13-Apr-25 08:12 AM] evov#0000
The other thing about happiness ... it averages out. Even if you pump in enough fulfilment to give them 100% raw happiness next week.... that won't translate into 100% actual happiness. So it's an uphill battle to get Engineers (and Sci where relevant) to build back up unless you've got large tech pop + uni's.


[13-Apr-25 08:14 AM] evov#0000
A very rough guide I look at.....  if I add the happiness and the unemployment together and it's less than 50% ... there needs to be a good reason for it.


[13-Apr-25 08:20 AM] martin1194#0000
ummm, I got it. So I can't 100% to trust that umemployment report too.
And should be stable the happiness for every people.


[13-Apr-25 08:20 AM] evov#0000
You can trust it. You just need to learn how to read it.


[13-Apr-25 10:09 AM] martin1194#0000
It is losing/increasing every sec even the report isn't up yet.


[13-Apr-25 10:09 AM] martin1194#0000
I see.  That why sometime hear shortage even no open job.


[13-Apr-25 10:44 AM] akyantor#0000
I've been trying to look after Demios, and at least one challenge is that there's not always good availablity of some of the upkeep goods that are required for higher tier pops. I started my own planet to make UTS, as the market was a bit broken when I first became governor. *I think realistically the taxes are two low, and probably should be paying more for some of these goods to promote supply.*


[13-Apr-25 10:49 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, I've personally found it a lot more challenging trying to predict the movements on a planet like Deimos over the prior planets I've look after... Haylos/SE-648c are extremely simple by comparison


[13-Apr-25 11:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm happy to help make more gov goods for OOG use. I know I did a run of PFE a while back that was pretty well used


[13-Apr-25 11:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
I can also step in on a planet if folks are stretched thin. I technically gov 4 planets, but they‚Äôre all pretty sleepy (Nyx planets and then my private FP world)


[13-Apr-25 11:38 AM] martin1194#0000
yup. It's true


[13-Apr-25 11:38 AM] martin1194#0000
btw, thank you for guiding me related this issue.


[13-Apr-25 11:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
> I started my own planet to make UTS
`Antares III d` is available


[13-Apr-25 11:40 AM] akyantor#0000
I already have one planet making UTS (ZV-194c) that's enough supply for Deimos, and should have some oversupply I can make available on the market. Only two open sellers at the ANT CX for that good at the moment.


[13-Apr-25 05:50 PM] evov#0000
As I understand it, no. It will re-calculate the population / jobs / happiness once per week, when the pop cycle rolls over. It's just that some numbers displayed are from BEFORE the current update, some are the numbers AFTER the update has taken place. It is confusing and clunky, but from what I've seen it's accurate / reliable.


[13-Apr-25 06:04 PM] evov#0000
I also found UTS to be a bit of a cost speed bump. I started to make my own, but ultimately I found it better to find ways of avoiding using it where possible. There are alternatives to UTS that might be worth looking into ( Putting DW into ACA to give Comfort AND culture looks like good value )

If Safety, Health and Comfort all get 100% fullfiled, Engineers raw happiness is at 70%. So if UTS / culture upkeeps are an issue, it might be worth ignoring it, going a bit heavier on the Safety/Health/Comfort and lean on education programs a bit more.

(some alternative Culture fulfilment with approx costs -)

[14-Apr-25 02:59 AM] akyantor#0000
I'll have a look at that combination, that said my initial gut feeling is that you'd potentially end up with spiralling increases in underutilised PIO/SET populations that woudl eventually make it inefficient. Worth a look though.


[14-Apr-25 11:59 AM] bookliko#0000
Had the same conclusion from my brief look


[14-Apr-25 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I do like the ACAs. The upfront cost is kind of high for the building, but the big downside is that the amoutn they provide ends up being really low as the planet gets big. For starting a new planet, they are fantastic.


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, went playing around with them you stuggle to see it move the needle all that much, and are super expensive to upgrade.


[14-Apr-25 12:43 PM] akyantor#0000
There's an oversupply of SET/TECH on Deimos, so maxing out education/culture seems to be best, as that way you're reducing how much inflation in underutilised PIO/SET/TECH you get.


[14-Apr-25 02:08 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Does the gov sheet give a number of what should be the tax on each pop to cover POPI/COGC?


[14-Apr-25 02:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Not really.


[14-Apr-25 02:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
The tax estimator has a lot of assumptions and really only works when you can assume you know what buildings everyone has


[14-Apr-25 02:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
(IE: you can pretend 100% of the people on malahat are doing EDC with Engineers and IDC with scientists).


[14-Apr-25 02:13 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, a bit of a dark art trying tune the taxes... utilisation of pops doesn't mean you're getting tax income for them


[14-Apr-25 02:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if you're not close to that, you sorta just need to adjust over time.


[14-Apr-25 02:14 PM] akyantor#0000
https://prunplanner.org/tools/government <- prunplanner has an attempt at it too, but the prices for PIO seem super high when I punch in the details for Diemos.


[14-Apr-25 02:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Because you don't know if people are using high pop or low pop buildings. cause taxes don't scale with the pop in a building.


[14-Apr-25 02:15 PM] mrsmith33#0000
How is the tax applied?


[14-Apr-25 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
That just copies off the sheet I made, so the costs per tier are good, but don't really help set the taxes

[14-Apr-25 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Scientist tax rate of 380 means that a building that uses scientists will be charged 380 per 24 hours of production. The base production of IDC is 1 for each 24 hours, so every 13hr it starts a new order and bills me 380


[14-Apr-25 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

[14-Apr-25 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
So it's double the tax.


[14-Apr-25 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
SLs use 20 scientists, but that number doesn't factor in


[14-Apr-25 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
so when you compare a RIG at 30 pio and a BMP at 100 PIO, they each charge the PIO tax rate (of 5) per 24 hours of base production


[14-Apr-25 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
But the BMP consumes 3x as much safety, health, etc as the RIG building, for the same tax


[14-Apr-25 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also idle buildings generate no tax income, but cost the full amount of govt upkeep.


[14-Apr-25 02:21 PM] akyantor#0000
You end up just having to tune it a bit over time

You also need to understand how Safety/Health/Comfort/Culture/Education fulfilment can cap out.
i.e. Education will be capped at the lowest % of the other 4. Comfort/Culture will be capped at the lowest % of Safety/Health.


[19-Apr-25 08:14 PM] martin1194#0000
ummm. So, Safety and Health is the most importance first. If no enough Safety and Health. What ever others filled, there are nothing.


[19-Apr-25 08:14 PM] evov#0000
If nothing changes, right now it looks like, Comfort will be at 30% fulfilment, but you've got inputs supplied to culture up to 107% and Education at 134%.  Which means the majority of the upkeep cost/inputs will just be wasted. Since Culture and Education will likely be capped at 30% due to low comfort.


[19-Apr-25 08:19 PM] martin1194#0000
Wasted 104% Education and 77%culture. D:

Yo comprendo


[19-Apr-25 08:28 PM] evov#0000
I think culture won't be wasted as bad.. I think that one will get capped at like 63%, Education is the big money waster.


[19-Apr-25 08:28 PM] martin1194#0000
A lesson for me :Pepepains:


[19-Apr-25 08:29 PM] evov#0000
I know it sucks, there's a lot of really odd / silly rules and mechanics around how pop works. Makes it really really punishing for new people to jump into governing.


[19-Apr-25 08:29 PM] evov#0000
Which . . . . is why people should probably start off on smaller less impactful planets rather than jump straight into governing multiple high tier planets while learning.


[19-Apr-25 08:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I filled the PFE on Nike just now. But the upkeep bar fills slowly over the week


[19-Apr-25 08:36 PM] evov#0000
I think with festivities, everything will start trending positive at least.


[19-Apr-25 08:36 PM] evov#0000
High pop planets are kinda like big boats with small rudders imo.

[20-Apr-25 04:31 AM] akyantor#0000
It's a big step up looking after a planet with serious TECH/ENG demands, even if you've looked after a smaller planet for a while tbh....


[20-Apr-25 04:34 AM] akyantor#0000
The good news is the actions taken did mean there was a net increase in ENG. The bad news is that it looks like there's been more ENG demand added since the last report, so the gap in supply vs demand still got worse. üò¶


[20-Apr-25 04:42 AM] evov#0000
Yea, ENG / SCI just need to be taken care of. It takes too much time + $ to recover from periods of low happiness.


[20-Apr-25 08:45 PM] martin1194#0000
Is this report give me info:
Safety and health not enough
And others 3 reach the limit?

[20-Apr-25 08:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Education was probably capped at the 44.4% that comfort was at.


[20-Apr-25 08:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
It looks like youa re filling just one. That is probably fine. It is tough to balance comfort. If you add a second item of comfort to the PAR, it will be too much.


[20-Apr-25 08:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
44.4% will go to 88%, which would be higher than your safety and health, and thus get capped


[20-Apr-25 08:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is where you might do fractional upkeep. Fill OFF in the SST to 100%, then just do a little DW, like fill the 250 buffer for one 3 day cycle, but not the other cycles.


[20-Apr-25 08:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
That is annoying to do though, so usually it's easier to increase the buildings.

Is that nothing help if have lot of building but without fillment?
Only PBH, LIB, UNI can help to increase education rate? (This happened without fillment)

Let me check it


[20-Apr-25 09:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
The education buildings are an important bonus to the education rate. For that, it doesn't matter if they are filled or not


[20-Apr-25 09:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those numbers in the POPI report are okay.


[20-Apr-25 09:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I try to aim for 70% Need Fulfillment when I am growing a population.


[20-Apr-25 09:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
+120 Engineers out of 2700 engineers is decent. and you have 6% unemployment.


[20-Apr-25 09:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that's good.


[20-Apr-25 09:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
6 open scientist jobs (and you gained 6, so it's actually zero)


[20-Apr-25 09:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
It sort of needs the festivals to stay happy unless you can get those needs filled higher


[20-Apr-25 09:05 PM] martin1194#0000
From the web, it shows building should have upkeep for the running


[20-Apr-25 09:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't understand that message


[20-Apr-25 09:08 PM] martin1194#0000
Cuz some planet I am trying to level up building. I am thinking about is it is any benefit if there is no any upkeep.


[20-Apr-25 09:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh, okay. Only education builds have a special benefit like that.


[20-Apr-25 09:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
`The PBH increases the growth rate by 0.001, the LIB by 0.002, and the UNI by 0.004. `


[20-Apr-25 09:25 PM] martin1194#0000
I see, so it shouldn't use all money on upgrade.


[20-Apr-25 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
The education bonus is small, but important on big planets. On Bober, I wouldn't do UNI upgrades just for that. Because they get expensive fast and Bober probably won't need a lot of SCI


[20-Apr-25 09:37 PM] martin1194#0000
I am thinking to upgrade SST or INF.

[21-Apr-25 10:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
They need culture and education to be 100% happy also, and those are at 0%


[21-Apr-25 10:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also they are a little unhappy because they remember last week when they weren't fully happy. There is a weighted curve of several weeks, so it takes a while for it to go up.


[21-Apr-25 10:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also unemployment makes them unhappy. Which is helpful because it prevents the populkation from growing too much

[22-Apr-25 02:43 AM] akyantor#0000
Is there a reason you‚Äôre trying to get it to 100% happy? You‚Äôve already a healthy buffer of unemployed PIO. If you make them too happy you‚Äôll just end up with more unemployed workers who consume more satisfaction. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.


[22-Apr-25 03:28 AM] martin1194#0000
Nah, just trying to understand the logic. This planet isn't upkeep by myself.


[22-Apr-25 03:33 AM] martin1194#0000
cuz I see this 100% 100% and 100% :hh:


[22-Apr-25 03:42 AM] evov#0000
People have needs. Gov's fill those needs. Each class of worker has a different proportion of needs that determine their happiness. Higher tier workers require more of the higher tier stuff to be happy.

If you have zero Education fulfilment for example.. Pioneers will be 2% sad, Engineers will be 10% sad and Scientists will be 30% sad.

Pioneers are so easy to please, they'll be 50% happy with just having the base level of life support that comes with the HABs that got built on the planet.


[22-Apr-25 07:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
The --- means 0%


[22-Apr-25 07:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Evo is correct. to expand on it further:

[22-Apr-25 07:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Your PIOS are at need fulfillment 100%, 100%, 100%, 0%, 0%.
So their base happiness is: 0.50 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.95 
Base happiness of 95%. (missing the 0.03 and 0.02). Unemployment is 19.3%.... so take 95% - 19.3% and you get 0.757... or 75.7% happiness. 

That is really close to 76.5%.


[22-Apr-25 07:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Next you need to do the weighted average: The happiness displayed is the weighted average of the True Happiness of the previous 5 weeks. The weights are, going from the previous week to 5 weeks ago: 0.4, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05


[22-Apr-25 07:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
last week was 61%, the week before was 62%. Do some estimating... that brings you down somewhere between 61% and your 75.7% happiness. let's call it 66.5%. That's about right.


[22-Apr-25 07:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then you have a festival 2 running, so you add 10%


[22-Apr-25 07:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
66.5% + 10% -> 76.5%


[22-Apr-25 07:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
and that's how it was calculated


[22-Apr-25 08:59 AM] martin1194#0000

I haven‚Äôt read it enough to really understand the effect other than I assume it‚Äôs attempting to make some of the large buildings more viable. The increased consumption rate makes it less hassle to fill

[22-Apr-25 10:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
I think just by volume it should be better We will see though


[22-Apr-25 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I'm excited for the changes. It will freshen things up.


[22-Apr-25 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
I will have to re-run them to see if it changed since last time. Pretty much everything is going to be quite a bit cheaper.


[22-Apr-25 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Building costs, base level up rates, and everything across the board gets a 60% reduction in consumption from the longer cycles. Unfortunately I don't think the drones really get better relative to anything else. And PK and BND gets better in the HOS but also not sure if that will matter. But I think it's a step in the right direction


[22-Apr-25 10:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Ah, there was an update in that post, I see it now


[22-Apr-25 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
I shared this elsewhere:


[22-Apr-25 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think overall there's a  flat reduction on the amount of upkeep consumed. The 3 -> 5 day cycle and 10 -> 15 day cycle will be a big difference across the board. I believe the education bonus mentioned is already in place, but the base tier level up rates will make natural growth easier, also with the need shifts for the lower tiers.

Between those changes, I think the PIO and SET populations will nearly take care of themselves. This is good cause they get sort of unmanagable on the largest planets... Whereas on small to mid size low tier planets, the base life support and safety will probably take care of them quite well. 

I think we still won't see numbers move in a way that makes drone posts and hospitals really viable. I have to check to see if things have changed since I last ran these. 

Worth noting that with IDC and EDC prices dropping more, they become even better in  broadcasting hubs and UNIs. Personally I always find education easier than culture and comfort, anyway.

4DA will be good, which is nice, cause PARs can be hard to manage on big planets.


[23-Apr-25 04:00 AM] evov#0000
Are the pop updates happening when the MM update happens? If so, it would be cool if someone has already made an updated table for the new need %'s as well as all the new upkeep changes.


[23-Apr-25 07:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah same patch it seems


[23-Apr-25 07:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll see if I have spare time for it. Maybe someone will beat me to it


[29-Apr-25 07:59 AM] martin1194#0000
@mrsmith33 Please check this.
If we don't push up safety or health, the Comfort and Culture will capped.

[29-Apr-25 09:44 AM] akyantor#0000

[29-Apr-25 07:33 PM] martin1194#0000
Yup, don't upgrade ACA only.


[30-Apr-25 01:32 AM] evov#0000
ZV-639D doesn't have any engineering pop. I've found sometimes the most cost effective way to maintain pop on those planets is to just max out health fulfilment and ignore Safety/Comfort. Is that an option worth looking at?


[30-Apr-25 01:48 AM] evov#0000
A quick look at the tools I use - 
Keeping the SST at lvl4 and supplying only OFF
Upgrading the INF to lvl6 and supplying only OFF

Ends up costing about the same upkeep as what's currently being filled (that I can see) now. But gets the raw happiness of Tech's above 50%   Raw happiness of ( Pio = 75%, Settler 67%, Tech 51% ). Then just use the PAR/ACA to help recover from a slide like is happening to tech's now.


[01-May-25 12:11 AM] martin1194#0000
This better than FESIII?
Cuz this planet is MrSmith33 leading but the TEC is dropping and finding the way to stop it.


[01-May-25 12:12 AM] martin1194#0000
Mayme he has his own mind now, I am just just afraid he just push up comfort/culture instead of safety/health.
