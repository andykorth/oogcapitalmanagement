Usually have partial loads flying between ANT, Deimos, Hephaestus, Astraeus if you aren't in a rush.

If anyone has a light load returning KI-401b to ANT I always have goods needing to be moved

Some more shipping work up ANT -> Norwick. One return trip Norwick -> ANT also available. Thanks.

(This is starting to be pretty common, so I'll post it here.)
