@everyone Dear Ooga Booga corporation members, the new hauler OOG-2000-Tayra will be ready in 23 h. It has 2000 t and 2000 m^3 cargo capacity. It's innovative design has been jointly developed by Ooga Booga Capital Management and the Lai Dai Corporation (Caldari State). It will fly between Amarr and Jita, with additional stops in Ashab, Rens, Hek, Dodixie and Perimeter.  No, wait, that's in a different universe.


[28-May-22 02:25 PM] yang_mills#0000
So we actually have to decide the destinations. OOG-2000 has an equal capacity for weight and volume, while OOG-3000 can carry 3 times as much tons as m^3. Because of that, OOG-2000 should in priority ship agricultural products, consumables (about the same number of m^3 and t), and also gases (more m^3 than t). For shipping ores, metals and minerals, OOG-3000 should rather be used. So natural destinations for OOG-2000 are Harmonia, KI-446b,  and all the gas giants, like QJ-382g, IY-206i. Etherwind and  Griffonstone are also possible, despite being in the opposite direction from ANT. Let me know in this channel, which routes you would prefer. @spatial_piano, I can ship your gases from QJ-382g.


[28-May-22 02:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
Was about to forget: Payment is not required to utilize the OOG-2000, though tipping the pilot would be appreciated to help maintain upkeep and fuel costs (quoting @insensless72).


[28-May-22 04:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills Is it this ship?

[28-May-22 04:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, this one.


[28-May-22 04:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
I do remember my old days in EVE, hauling from Amarr to Jita and back, in my Tayra.


[29-May-22 09:13 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Haha I did that trip one way - the Jita price for a Sigil was really high so I would haul in a Sigil then sell everything and the ship then kill my clone and respawn in Amarr 😅

[29-May-22 09:30 AM] yang_mills#0000
That's because you didn't have implants on your clone.😄


[29-May-22 09:53 AM] yjhasaday#0000
haha very true! I had another clone with the implants - definitely didn't want to suicide that one 😅


[29-May-22 11:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone The first destination of OOG-2000-Tayra will be the Benten Station. There is a full cargohold of SF awaiting there. Let me know if you need stuff shipped to Benten from Antares area.


[29-May-22 01:34 PM] yang_mills#0000

[01-Jun-22 02:00 PM] yjhasaday#0000
@yang_mills no rush but I would like to charter Tayra to do a route to QJ-382g at some point? MarkyMark was kind enough to donate his entire inventory over to me so I have thousands of m^3 of gases to be transported. From what I understand the OOG-3000 only has 1000m^3 of volume, whereas Tayra has 2000m^3 - is that correct @insensless72?

I'm flexible with landing location - where does the corp consume the most H? I will need 500 for myself at either Phobos or Nike, but the remaining 1500 I'll sell to corp for dirt cheap!


[01-Jun-22 02:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
allocater and myself consume H on Phobos and Hephaestus respectively, for our plastics production


[01-Jun-22 02:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Namthorn and Insensless have some operations on Nike and Griffonstone that also use H. In short I think Phobos and Nike are good bulk drop off points


[01-Jun-22 02:07 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Sounds good, in that case I'll let @yang_mills decide whichever of Phobos or Nike is easiest for him and Tayra's next planned trips


[01-Jun-22 02:08 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Once again, no rush! Just whenever Tayra is free


[01-Jun-22 02:14 PM] namthorn#0000
Yea I'd take some on Nike on occasion, again mainly for plastics xD


[01-Jun-22 02:25 PM] insensless72#0000
That is correct

Tayra will fly as follows: Benten -> Nike -> Deimos -> Hephaestus ->ANT CX. From ANT CX it can fly to QJ-382g. Do you also need stuff moved TO QJ-382g?


[01-Jun-22 05:15 PM] yang_mills#0000
@Nike Tayra will arrive on Nike in 48h. Then it will fly Nike -> Deimos. There will be approx. 400t/800m^3 free space on the trip Nike->Deimos. Post your ads.

Sorry! Missed that. Tayra has already departed.


[04-Jun-22 03:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
Tayra flies Deimos -> ANT CX, full. Will arrive in 6h. After that it will fly ANT CX -> Heph -> Phobos ->  QJ382g. On the trip ANT CX->Heph there will be 500t/550m^3 free cargo space, so I can take shipping ads.


[05-Jun-22 05:53 AM] yang_mills#0000
@Hephaestus Arrival on Heph in 11h. Tayra flies to Phobos after that. At least 900t/700m^3 free space.

@Phobos Tayra departed to Phobos and will arrive in 8h. After that it will fly Phobos->QJ-650c-> QJ-382g. There will be at least 1000t/1200m^3 free space on the trip Phobos->QJ-650c and it will fly empty QJ-650c-> QJ-382g. Does anyone have a base on QJ-650c and need shipping?

You have handled my shipping needs for the weekend. If there is not an obvious route to fly, it is okay to let it sit for a moment.


[12-Jun-22 09:52 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe there is a long distance CX -> CX transfer that would be profitable


[12-Jun-22 09:54 AM] churavis#0000
Maybe a C run to Hortus or Moria?


[12-Jun-22 10:12 AM] allocater#0000

[12-Jun-22 10:54 AM] churavis#0000
Maybe we should make one designed for longer routes


[12-Jun-22 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they already are pretty much, we could go larger fuel tanks for significant added expense.


[12-Jun-22 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Depends on what the current pilots think of the medium sized fuel tanks


[12-Jun-22 11:02 AM] churavis#0000
Are High or Hyper powered FTL engines worth it?


[12-Jun-22 11:02 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they are very time consuming


[12-Jun-22 11:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We have discussed making a ship like this for immediate sale, I think 7-8 mil would make it worthwhile


[12-Jun-22 11:15 AM] allocater#0000
RAT/DW are best shipped with oog2000
C LST Ores are best with oog3000

It's OK if you fill only half a ship. Because I will fly to QJ-650c anyway, and it's just ine jump away from your planet.


[21-Jun-22 01:40 PM] yjhasaday#0000

[21-Jun-22 05:18 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, no worries. I'll run a ship out there with Bfabs in a couple of days when I have another 500 H to bring back. If I ramp up COLs I'll need Tayra's help to move that much H, can I continue to rely on periodic trips from Tayra? I'm already at 7 COLs which is about 250 H per day - so I can fill Tayra about once a week!

I could use some H on Hephaestus, I'm almost out


[24-Jun-22 04:59 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have another boat of H on its way to Phobos so I can probably part with the H I brought back on Tayra if there is enough need on Heph, I promised some to @yang_mills  but I could probably send another 400 for Heph people to split?

I'm good right now.

Yeah I just loaded up on water.


[25-Jun-22 07:20 PM] yang_mills#0000
Does this mean yes you need shipping or no you don't? English is not my native language so I may not understand something that is not precise enough.


[25-Jun-22 08:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sorry. I don't need shipping. I already have my water.

("Yeah" meaning: "Yeah I'm good right now too", in reply to Domicius.) But it was pretty unclear. my bad 😄

Tayra will depart to @Demeter  in 8h, from @Phobos. Post your ads if you want something shipped. Also prepare ads for the return.


[26-Jun-22 06:47 AM] domicius#0000

Ok, well, this is like 10 thumb drives worth of EDC, lol,  so $500 work?

Haha that's what I pay for my EDC shipments! It's basically just free money because they take up no space at all

You said you were going to Hephaestus after Deimos, do you expect to have extra space for that leg?


[01-Jul-22 02:43 PM] yang_mills#0000
Priority will be given to shipping hullplates. I expect 1300t and 800 m^3 free space. Yes, LHP take a lot of volume. Perhaps @insensless72 also needs to ship hullplates to Heph. Basically it's fine if you have heavy but lower volume stuff.


[01-Jul-22 03:20 PM] churavis#0000

I have about 600t


[02-Jul-22 05:57 PM] yang_mills#0000
All right. Then Tayra will come to Harmonia. I also have crops to ship.


[03-Jul-22 10:59 AM] churavis#0000
I have 4 small shipping contracts up for Hephaestus to Phobos for the consumables with longer fulfilment tails given the current situation. I wasn't able to get STL for as much PT (only 30) but did manage to make more PWO for 200 total. I'll let you know when to put up buy ads on Phobos


[03-Jul-22 12:13 PM] yang_mills#0000

@jackinabox86 Thanks guys. I am back now and I can use a trip out to QJ whenever a ship is ready. Also I built the warehouse but its default price is set to 2000 AIC - do I need to be governor to chagne it?


[04-Jul-22 09:35 AM] insensless72#0000
Yes you do, once governor a yellow Edit button will appear on the Fees screen


[04-Jul-22 09:37 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Awww man, so now I have to built an Admin centr before I can change the WAR price?! 😦


[04-Jul-22 09:42 AM] insensless72#0000
Unfortunately, however the real kick in the nuts is that you can only gov 1 planet at a time


[04-Jul-22 09:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
I can contribute Lfabs for an Admin. However, I first have to finish the COGC on QJ-650c. If @yjhasaday becomes gov on his planet, I could replace him on Nike.


[04-Jul-22 09:45 AM] yang_mills#0000
@jackinabox86 Are you going to fly to QJ-682g?


[04-Jul-22 10:44 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Do YJ need stock off?  I need some of his stuff at Phobos, but I will be a couple days getting there still.  Probably have him covered, but will let him confirm @yjhasaday


[04-Jul-22 10:47 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yes, I can do a full 2000 ship right now. Do you need H or AMM?


[04-Jul-22 10:48 AM] rune_242#0000
Can I get a piece of the H?


[04-Jul-22 11:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday @jackinabox86 Then I can fly with my Tayra to QJ-382g. I will come to @Harmonia later.


[04-Jul-22 11:37 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I like this plan - I have a full ship ready right now and it sounds like there is immediate need (including myself). @jackinabox86 I should be able to also fill the 2002 in about 4.5 days.

@rune_242 I'm happy to cut you in on the first load that comes back - where do you need it? And how much are you looking for


[04-Jul-22 11:38 AM] rune_242#0000
nike would be great


[04-Jul-22 11:39 AM] rune_242#0000
I'll buy up to 400


[04-Jul-22 11:39 AM] jackinabox86#0000

Will you have space coming back?


[03-Aug-22 08:24 AM] yang_mills#0000

I will be sending about a standard load worth of shipments but it will take some time to get it to Phobos


[03-Aug-22 10:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
How much time?


[03-Aug-22 10:40 AM] churavis#0000
Less than 26h


[03-Aug-22 10:40 AM] yang_mills#0000
I will wait for it then.

if you don't fill it and don't mind a stop on the way, you can always stop by at KI-401b to pick up TIO

I will fill the rest if no one else does

Put up a 225t ad


[06-Aug-22 08:30 AM] churavis#0000
499.5t + 225t = 724.5t


[06-Aug-22 08:31 AM] jackinabox86#0000
That it is. Just ignore the ad and I’ll delete when my cell service is better

[08-Aug-22 02:54 PM] yang_mills#0000
@allocater, @dersix Do you need shipping from KI-401?


[08-Aug-22 02:58 PM] dersix#0000
For me not exactly, but there are 2.4k H fir 30/u if someone wants :)


[08-Aug-22 03:00 PM] allocater#0000
401b was just emptied, but if 401d has H you can make a visit


[10-Aug-22 06:06 AM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday Do you need shipping from QJ-682g?


[10-Aug-22 08:50 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Not presently, I just took a load with my 2000, thank you though!

[19-Aug-22 03:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
Accepted. Waiting you to provision.


[19-Aug-22 03:44 PM] churavis#0000
We really need to complain more loudly about contracts not having auto provision

[21-Aug-22 08:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
~~@everyone Departing Benten -> ANT in 6h. 1300 t/ 1300 m^3 cargo space left.~~ Ship full. Just realized that there is cheap GAL on Benten. 😄


[21-Aug-22 10:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Hope you’re using it yourself! Don’t be dumping it on ANT and killing our profit margin! If you ever need GAL in the future, I have a GAL base and can bring some back


[21-Aug-22 10:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, the GAL is for myself. I didn't know that you extract GAL. That's cool.


[21-Aug-22 10:24 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I also have 2 contacts on Katoa that sell me GAL in bulk for super cheap! Its a good place to go for fuel inputs. But now I would recommend coming to @jackinabox86 and I for any fuel inputs because we've created a pretty solid supply chain for fuel making - and we can hook you up with prices better than Benton or Hortus 🙂

[21-Aug-22 11:50 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah. And no worries on selling it if you want. I was mostly goofing off! We do enjoy being able to undercut others in the region profitably though


[24-Aug-22 06:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday I will arrive in a couple of days on QJ-382g and build a base there. I could ship on the way back to Phobos some of your stuff (but not a full cargo).


[25-Aug-22 08:05 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, let me know how much space you have and I can fill it - lots of H available for corp


[25-Aug-22 10:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
Prepare a shipment for 1400 m^3.


[25-Aug-22 01:33 PM] yjhasaday#0000
ad is up on QJ382g LM, I gave 10 days so hopefully thats enough time. Thanks!

[27-Aug-22 05:47 PM] yang_mills#0000
I will fly @Phobos -> @Demeter in 20h. At least 1200t/1200m^3 free cargo space on the way there. Prepare your ads.


[28-Aug-22 09:45 AM] yang_mills#0000
@Phobos Does anyone have stuff to ship to Demeter?


[28-Aug-22 06:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope, but I have stuff to take off Demeter. Do you know where you're flying next?


[29-Aug-22 06:07 PM] yang_mills#0000
Demeter-> Phobos.


[29-Aug-22 09:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
A handful of ads posted, take whatever you can- I figure you may already have stuff going out.


[31-Aug-22 03:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
@archielvahr I picked one of your ads but you did not provision it.


[31-Aug-22 03:04 PM] archielvahr#0000

@churavis please provision the shipping contract.


[03-Sep-22 05:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
@churavis I requested the termination of the contract since you didn't provision it. I don't have time to wait.


[03-Sep-22 05:52 AM] allocater#0000
the downside of custom contracts


[03-Sep-22 05:53 AM] balbar#0000
yeah, autoprovision also for custom contracts would be nice


[03-Sep-22 05:55 AM] yang_mills#0000
It wasn't a custom contract. It was on LM.


[03-Sep-22 05:55 AM] allocater#0000
the downside of forgetting to check the box 😄

[03-Sep-22 07:28 AM] churavis#0000
So sorry about that, you can terminate the contract if you are no longer able to transport it
