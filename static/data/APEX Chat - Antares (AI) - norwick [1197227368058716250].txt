**marismols**:	Just calculated that if only the cheapest supply is provided for upkeep of each infrastructure building, then the weekly cost is 125k. Weekly income is 160k. But looking at the happines numbers, planet is clearly in slow decline. So occasional boost will be necessary. Thanks to Numsgil and jvaler for helping with warehouse expansion. And thanks to Agavan for donating supplies!

**marismols**:	taxes collected 168k


[01-Feb-24 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	Ok, looks like situation with Tech people could be better. I"m running the Technitian immigration support program, but it ends in 7 hours. Not sure how it works, when exactly we get those. But after that I will run festivities again. That will stop techs leaving the planet. According to Archiel's governor helper we should have better happines numbers. Still trying to figure it out. Anyway, the problem is noted and solution is coming :)


[01-Feb-24 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	we alway appreciate your openness


[01-Feb-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I think the population only changes during POPR events, so it'll probably be about another week before new ones come, but I could be wrong


[01-Feb-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	(or technically the planet gets 200 PIO when someone first settles, but only the new base can use them)


[01-Feb-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Both points above are correct: new POPs only appear when the new POPR comes out (which will be in 7 days).


[01-Feb-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	However, the POPR is deceptive: The "Open Jobs" number is how many open jobs there were BEFORE the "Change". That means there are only 69 open jobs on the planet at the moment.


[01-Feb-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Festivities are the worst thing imo, since they don't change the actual happiness of the planet, and so can lead to a death-spiral of migration if used too frequently. Also, you get all types of POPs, not just the ones you want. We're already over-filled with PIOs & SETs, and we'll just get more useless eaters with a Festivity.


[01-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You're better off using Immigration to get new TECHs, while stabilising happiness to maintain current TECHs.


[01-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	(I also like how you're slowly bleeding off PIOs & SETs, which is hard to do in a controlled manner)


[01-Feb-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	What do you mean by usless eaters? Does extra jobless pop increase any expenses?


[01-Feb-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	My idea was that there are two ways to increase Tech pop - one by direct migration and second by education. If we use education then we need more sett and pio which in turn will increase the number of tech. Or am I wrong?


[01-Feb-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	yes, but the unemployed PIO & SET will need upkeep too


[01-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	so the more unemployment you have, the more you're "wasting" your upkeep


[01-Feb-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	which is why you'll want to lower unemployment to decrease the costs


[01-Feb-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I gues you're right


[01-Feb-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I think 10-20% unemployment is the sweet spot if you want to easily allow new bases to come.  Sub 10% is too easy to end up with shortfall, and more than 20% seems wasteful with upkeep expenses


[01-Feb-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	I'm not a governor, so just my 2 cents


[01-Feb-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	It does depend a little on the population of the planet.  On a low population planet you might want a larger buffer percentage wise, but on a planet like Norwick I think 10% unemployed is about right to keep a buffer for new people arriving without having excessive numbers


[01-Feb-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	That's what I aim for at Nascent


[01-Feb-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	If you're really on top of things you might be okay with 10%, but I've seen a lot of pop reports go from 10% to a shortfall in 2-3 weeks


[01-Feb-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	eg: ZV-307b about 60 days ago, settlers went from 9.2% unemployment to 0.9% in a week, then to a shortfall the week after


[01-Feb-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	That's why I said it depends on population.  On Norwick, that 23% unemployed for PIO is about 15000 pops


[01-Feb-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	sure


[01-Feb-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	but ZV-307b is similar population-wise


[01-Feb-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	On Ant IIg, which I also manage, the unemployment rate is about 27%, but that is less than 2000 pops


[01-Feb-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	in terms of, say, settlers


[01-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	we have a ton of pioneers here at Norwick, which skews those numbers, but our settler and tech populations aren't very large


[01-Feb-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	It does depend on which population group you are looking at


[01-Feb-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	On Nascent I have 63% SET unemployment, but there are only 360 of them, lol

**marismols**:	Looking at the pop report, all seems in check. Last taxes were 169k. I decided on the strategy that I run festivities program all the time, but instead decrease the amount of resources spent. Somehow I have a feeling that its more effective. Festivities program increase happiness of all pops by 20%, which I think would be more expensive to achieve by extra supplies. To keep the pop levels in check if they get too high I will just cap the levels of buildings.

[14-Apr-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	@RiseofFilth lets say that we cut-out the guesswork? I'm affected by only 50k in production taxes every week, with 8-10 mil in sales revenue, generated from such production. How about you?


[20-Apr-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For anyone else interested in these things, my facial tissue maths estimates daily base taxes, to be worth the weighted average (in POP terms) for your active production lines, times the established LR tax rate, rounded up. I'm fairly certain that's how it goes, even though I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere. I'm guessing it also depends on what you're doing. Tight margin/low profitability stuff might get incredibly sketchy with significant tax increases, in triple digit percentages, while those making stupid money might just not care at all. :/

**RiseofFilth**:	Just wanted to give a shout out to Turlorn. Ever since Marismol stepped aside, he has done a good job at managing things and I'd be happy to see him continue as Governor, and I'd be happy to serve alongside as a Parliamentarian. Please consider voting for him if he lacks the vote to get the top slot so he can continue his good work. Otherwise, I will happily take some votes as well!


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Marismols isnt even active anymore Rise.


[05-Jul-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	The politicking has become alittle thick as of late, no?


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Turlorn hasnt failed with his administration here.  The ousting attempt is obvious.


[05-Jul-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I... genuinely do not want to be governor here. I've made it clear where my priorities and that I stand behind Turlorn here, as I feel he is an effective governor.


[05-Jul-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I'm not sure how I can be more clear than that


[05-Jul-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	He seems to be a pretty straightforward guy. I imagine if he was trying to oust him he wouldn't be saying "Please consider voting for him if he lacks to vote to get the top slot so he can continue his good work."


[05-Jul-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And I agree. Turlorn has done a good job.


[05-Jul-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Good governors should never be replaced usurped. Turlorn is good. My only wish here is to help and offer advice.


[05-Jul-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	replaced/usurped


[14-Jul-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Keep good people whenever you can. A person in office who: communicates to their constituents regularly, starts needed POPR programs, and/or arranges/contributes to COGC/POPI needs, is a +100 in my book.


[14-Jul-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However, since voter turn-outs during election cycles have always been pretty much relegated to those who stay active in here, things can always change for the worse, when 61% of your voting base could actually vote, and pick someone else.


[15-Jul-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	Just reading some earlier chat, I really don't understand how what Rise said could be misconstrued as trying to oust Turlorn.  That's some mind-bending logic

**RiseofFilth**:	I think Turlorn has continued to have done a great job, and am happy to see him continue as governor. I appreciate the votes and confidence so I can serve alongside in Parliament, but I very much advcocate that Turlorn be ensure of getting the top spot.

**Frentic**:	thanks Turlorn o7


[02-Oct-24 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	let me know if I can help somehow. o7


[02-Oct-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	by current numbers it'll take two weeks to fill all your technician jobs. i'll see if i can accelerate it.


[02-Oct-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	It's not all mine btw. Some other base has shortages too.


[03-Oct-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You could run a TEC immigration program, for +100 TECs, which would basically smooth out the situation in a week.


[03-Oct-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It'll cost like 50k AIC or something like that.


[03-Oct-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	i innitiated a vote on a TEC immigration program.


[04-Oct-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@frentic Been sick the last few days, but when there is excessive unemployment, happiness goes down. There was for techs, hence why population was being bleed off. That is not a bad thing, and is normal. Now that there is demand and open jobs, as you can see, happiness jumped 10% within a week. And that is the weighted average, so that means the true happiness is much higher. If ya just wait until next popr, you will see happiness will be in the mid-50s and the remaining open jobs will all be filled (unless someone makes more TECH buildings, but then that will drive happiness higher and we will see more immigration)


[04-Oct-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As long as a strong base is there, like ours with 3.3k techs, programs are rarely useful rather than just sufficient fulfillment and players creating jobs


[04-Oct-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	but doesn't such a low tec popi risk bases not having all their job filled in case new tec buildings are set up? like, 2 new bases dedicated to tec buildings only. I think that would be the main concern maybe?


[04-Oct-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	you're right. that's when you inform your governor of your intentions so that measures can be deployed at the right time. :)

[05-Oct-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SillyOldJack**:	Wait, there's a social aspect?


[05-Oct-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**FastProducer**:	Are we getting more TECs?


[26-Mar-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	in last POPR we gained 94, and reduced employment from 21% to 0%


[26-Mar-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	should gain alot more in next POPR


[27-Mar-25 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Gained 94, but doesn't it state there are now 852 open jobs, from 21% unemployment?


[27-Mar-25 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	because everyone in the unemployment got jobs, and now there are too many jobs ]


[27-Mar-25 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	So don't we need to run a program to increase the amount ot TECs?


[27-Mar-25 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	it would be beneficial probably, since there is a massive influx of people building IVP's, but its not like we are loosing TECs anymore, since now there is actually a demand for them


[27-Mar-25 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	@FastProducer - check the government screen, there’s a program being voted on now :)


[27-Mar-25 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Great, thank you!


[27-Mar-25 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Np! I'm not in the government, but Turlorn said that he's boosting TEC happiness as well. That should help with some of the deficit. Not much more you can do for a big demand spike like this afaik - we've gone from ~850 unemployed TECs to 852 open jobs, so that's about 1600 new TEC positions since last POPR if I'm reading that all correctly


[27-Mar-25 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	so probably around 22 new IVP if I had to guess, based on MTP/MEA prices :D


[27-Mar-25 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	I mean, 11 for me.  I looked p a food COCG planet with available TECs when I picked this planet, someone else must have done the same thing


[28-Mar-25 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	we're having a shortage of technicians right now. i'm deploying meassures to alleviate that.


[29-Mar-25 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	yay :D


[03-Apr-25 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	There are even more open jobs for tecs than last week....


[03-Apr-25 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	That's true, but there's also 218 more TECs than there were last week. There were 3879 jobs for TECs last POPR and now there's 4633 - that's a LOT of growth to catch up with


[03-Apr-25 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	(by jobs I mean population + open jobs, I think that's the correct way to calculate it)


[03-Apr-25 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	despite getting a few more technicians we got even more open jobs. i'm boosting their happiness even more.


[03-Apr-25 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Turlorn**:	the effect of the upgraded park kicks in as well now.


[04-Apr-25 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	Woah, just a casual 20% increase in one week on an already established planet

**Turlorn**:	we have increased our amount of technicians by 940. their happiness is at 93%. we still have 1240 open jobs so it will take two more weeks until all current positions are filled.
