Project 6115 is a top secret project to colonize the three triple-green planets on OS-099. This is the only system in the game with three triple-green goldilocks zone planets. It's also in ANT space, albeit 16 jumps away.

Ideas have been discussed elsewhere, but I think the winning idea is to make 3 electronics planets in the system, due to the low logistic burden. 

We will simultaneously build ADMs, establish a government, and set a high, but refundable, base founding fee.

I think something like this is the best argument for a 10M base establishment tax - getting all the materials out there is gonna be really expensive at first, so it makes sense to try and keep others not in the project out, or to at least pay their fair share 🙂


[27-Jun-24 11:11 AM] churavis#0000
What would you make with 3 electronics planets?


[27-Jun-24 11:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’m guessing EDC / IDC would be a safe bet, for one. For this to make sense, we’d need something very value-dense for shipping home, as well as something that minimizes import requirements

[27-Jun-24 11:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
“Safe bet” meaning highest chance of this being feasible as something that can make money in this case. Not necessarily something that will guarantee returns 😄


[27-Jun-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
We would need some technician bases, but they can make LD, etc


[27-Jun-24 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think it’s probably warranted to look into the nearby planets as well, and see if it’s feasible to make some POPI materials there - again, just with the aim of minimizing import requirements


[27-Jun-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, so, flipping back through search history: GM-498 has one of the best water planets in the game. Post map change that's 4 jumps away.  Resharing this map I made, you can see the legend at the top:

You can poke around in-game for nearby resources.

I can move my Eos base out there, will be way cheaper on parts and fill up some SET and TEC need

[27-Jun-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
It would be cool to do something more useful than electronics down there but I don't think we have a complete enough chain. EPO and other chemistry products could be good candidates.


[27-Jun-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
In the next few weeks, I'm gonna try to clear up 3 permits

I need a bit more software production for ship parts


[27-Jun-24 12:03 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Could move all the software from phobos to there, and only do Electronic parts on Phobos


[27-Jun-24 12:06 PM] akyantor#0000
Cool project, keen to join, but must finish my current plans in main space first. Love the idea of an ADI outpost in the outer reaches 🙂


[27-Jun-24 12:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or move low end software out, and keep high end where we have ample scientists


[27-Jun-24 12:07 PM] mrsmith33#0000
yeah, that's a better idea


[27-Jun-24 12:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Guess it’s time to add a bunch of upgrades to my HQ


[27-Jun-24 03:11 PM] zipatsu#0000
I've built up that planet from scratch a while back, it's currently home to me and one other player and has pretty much every infrastructure building needed + admin paid for by the sale of fresh, pure H2O ✌️

[27-Jun-24 04:38 PM] zipatsu#0000
HYR costs a bit extra but if you have them then it's a pretty fast trip at roughly 72k/roundtrip if buying fuel from the CX on ANT max speed and ~59k going a few hours slower ✌️


[27-Jun-24 04:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
How long would ANT - OS-99 (whichever planet) take for HYR? Just curious 🙂

That’s not bad at all. I spend about that much time going to either wind for DW atm 😁

[27-Jun-24 06:37 PM] draconisdomini#0000
There's HAL on OS-416b (needs HSE) and GM-332c (HSE+INS) if we wanted to go down the chemistry route for one of the three


[27-Jun-24 06:38 PM] draconisdomini#0000
H for making EPO would probably have to come from KI-401d


[27-Jun-24 06:40 PM] draconisdomini#0000
O could come from OS-476d (HSE+INS)


[27-Jun-24 07:02 PM] draconisdomini#0000
GK-115i (HSE+INS) has the second highest amount of SCR in the galaxy, though I am not sure how useful that is


[29-Jun-24 03:22 AM] allocater#0000
1.5 days is very doable, I fly like this multiple times per week ANT-Etherwind-Malahat


[29-Jun-24 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
@archielvahr you still have those fancy charts from when we were trying to find good resources near 099? Think maybe that was 7 months ago


[29-Jun-24 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
I know there's the map with water quality


[29-Jun-24 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
Maybe that's the one you already posted...


[29-Jun-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I had a lot of variations all dumped into the strategy channel at some point. I'm looking to see what else I had. I think that one posted above shows most of it.


[29-Jun-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here is a detail map with "good" resources listed:

[29-Jun-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that's actually Resources in the top 5 of the universe. Which should be a profitable level, although you could manage with lower


[29-Jun-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
So we have O next door, TIO and LST 2 jumps. 
FEO, ZIR, ALO at 3 jumps
H2O on Zipatsu's planet 4 jumps (on-route to the cx)

[30-Jun-24 03:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
A hyf planet is an interesting idea. There is water available. I don't think it's a great region for making C, cause it's heavy and you'd have to ship it back. AU-605c has a food processing COGC, so you could make RAT/DW (MUS/VEG/MAI recipe I guess..?) Can't make FIM without farms doing HER

{Reactions}

[30-Jun-24 03:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here's the region. Yellow dot is OS-099. blue dot is the water planet. Purples have a cheap planet we could put anything on: http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_2024-06-30_15-45-38.png

"cheap" being SEA or MCG


[30-Jun-24 03:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
the green ring is the planet with the food COGC


[30-Jun-24 05:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah I was looking at that planet, it's got a great TIO, idk why they went food on it


[30-Jun-24 05:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
But I think there's an even better one in OS?


[30-Jun-24 08:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suppose it's H2O extraction in GM, then convert it to DW to save shipping on AU

Thanks to Domicius for the funding, and MrSmith, Exeler, and Zipatsu for prefab purchases, plus others I'm sure I'm forgetting!

This includes 3x COGC, WAR, LM, and ADMs. Just starting out with 2 SD on each planet to get technicians started. More to come with the next ship

[05-Jul-24 09:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Still need techs to educate into other tiers


[05-Jul-24 09:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
Well I should say zero workforce, my 200 pioneers on OS-099B aren't employed. And we have a way to stop randos from making PIO bases on certain planets


[05-Jul-24 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
I should have a ship free for this soon - would having more bases help at this stage?


[05-Jul-24 12:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd say just plan them out for now. I am going to see how the first POPI reports come in. I started with just 100 techs, I figure it will be short for a while


[07-Jul-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently OS-099 is the same number of jumps from Hortus as ANT so it's using ICA currency in the government 🙄

[07-Jul-24 10:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's the only system with 3 habitable planets


[07-Jul-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, best system in the game (sorta)


[07-Jul-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Partly a prestige project. It was made a handful of jumps closer a few months ago when they changed the map. There are some future promises of improving extracted resources out in the further reaches of the map, so it might be helpful in that case


[07-Jul-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also the project was made easier by allowing multiple planets governed by one person, so now was a good time to do it


[07-Jul-24 11:11 AM] hernanduer#0000
just need fertility then it really will be the best


[09-Jul-24 08:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay exciting updates!

Each of the three planets now have
ADM, COGC, WAR, and a LM. 

They also have a SST, INF, and art cafe. (one still needs some RDE or something that I forgot to ship).

I am governor of all 3 planets now, they are all running technician immigration jobs, and have their POPI filled. 

A base establishment fee is established on each planet, it is fully refundable to any OOG member who joins 😉 If you need help footing the 10m ICA, we can work something out, lol

Population is very slow to grow at first, so I will keep everyone up to date about that.


[15-Jul-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Project update! Next population report hits in 3 or 4 days. I have 100 techs working on each planet, with jobs for the next 100


[15-Jul-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can keep growing these myself, but it could be feasible for another person to start making bases out here if desired


[15-Jul-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hern had a good idea to make one of them something other than electronics, (esp in the short term), but I don't remember what it is


[15-Jul-24 04:40 PM] melon164#0000
I would happily throw down several short-term WPL or PPF bases.


[15-Jul-24 04:40 PM] melon164#0000
That’s SET though


[15-Jul-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly wouldn't hurt. They'll educate upwards, in addition to the migration that will be happening. We can probably avoid PIOs


[15-Jul-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Unless someone has a use case


[15-Jul-24 04:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Are there any POPI / base upkeep needs that we could address with one of the planets, to cut down on shipping? or is shipping not as huge of an issue as it seemed?


[15-Jul-24 04:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
My ships take 2 or 3 days to get there, but it's been fine since there's not a lot to ship


[15-Jul-24 04:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just needs DW, OFF, and the COGC mats, and I have a good supply of all of them


[15-Jul-24 04:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you bring up 100 of each for each planet you can cover all them easily for a couple weeks if I forget 🤷‍♂️


[15-Jul-24 05:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
Fair enough. I suppose there's not a ton to ship back and forth at this early stage anyway. I can toss down some WPLs as well 🙂


[15-Jul-24 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
(With the art cafe, you can cover comfort and culture with DW, at least for a few hundred to thousand pop)


[15-Jul-24 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Cool, just call a planet b, c, or d.. so you don't end up overlapping 🙂


[15-Jul-24 05:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
B! 🙂


[15-Jul-24 05:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll try to haul out a bunch of fuel as well, just in case anyone gets stranded


[15-Jul-24 05:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr  - would labs work better, actually? Since they employ some SET and some TEC


[15-Jul-24 05:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
do you need 10m ICA? For the base construction cost?


[15-Jul-24 05:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmmm entirely up to you. Whatever y ou can run the longest without it being a logistics burden is probably best


[15-Jul-24 05:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Cool, I'll look at prunplanner then - I've got 6M ICA in the bank, so I'd only need to swap for 4

Once I get my early game started, I would be interested in developing that area. Iv pretty much tapped out the smelting potential of Ant at this point and would like to expand some more

[16-Jul-24 08:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, Sidepipe has  700-1000 (?) SET on b. Melon has 700 SET coming for c. I seem to suddently need a lot of PSL, so I'm going to make OS-099d a mix of SD and PPF. They roll over tomorrow, and Techs are already queued, but the week after that I'll queue settler immigration on all 3. 

@melon164  is already enroute. I gave away all my ICA for the moment, so if you can build the base, the government can send the kickback afterwards


[16-Jul-24 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah OS-099d is gonna be 700 SET, 200 techs for me. At least for now


[16-Jul-24 09:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
Will figure out what makes sense and send it tomorrow - I’m either going to do WPL or labs. I’ll let you know as soon as I know 😄


[16-Jul-24 09:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
If anyone else gets there before me, just ping me and I can send them the 10M fee 🙂

What's the sublight speed look like between the planets in opposition?

usually a handful of hours at the default burn. Not as nice as Antares I

Fuel hasn't been too bad in my experience


[16-Jul-24 10:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
We could always haul some in and list it on the LM for emergencies


[16-Jul-24 10:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
hopefully the next announcement is about corps CXs, but it's sounding like they might push the corp ownership out a bit


[16-Jul-24 10:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
I assume they'll want to have some kind of corps context, and perhaps even some kind of voting on board members who can access it


[16-Jul-24 10:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sort of expected some corp consolidation now that the one person government corps were done


[16-Jul-24 10:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not really sure if that happened though


[16-Jul-24 10:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly not sure what they might do after the "second half of the politics and infrastructure" update


[16-Jul-24 10:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have dreams of building an OOG CX in OS-099 and just making our own cooler economy 😄


[16-Jul-24 10:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
😎


[16-Jul-24 10:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a lot of people will say "the CX is too thin already, adding corp CXes will just thin the actual CX more"


[16-Jul-24 10:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hard to know if the devs share that sentiment


[16-Jul-24 10:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
You know, I’ve heard a lot of people say exactly that


[16-Jul-24 10:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
But we already trade all these goods internally anyway


[16-Jul-24 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah 🤷‍♂️


[16-Jul-24 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh but they don't sit "locked into" a cx


[16-Jul-24 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Where things tend to get forgotten for years, heh


[16-Jul-24 10:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
It will sort of change the situation with discounted prices . I'm not sure how that will shape up


[16-Jul-24 10:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
If every corp has a CX where everything on it is half off, the main CX becomes the backup CX. But also each person is just deciding if they want to "help out" by selling their stuff at half price, or generate capital selling at full price.... Which sort of raises the point that the internal corp market should happen at full price, and then the corp finds more effective ways to help out new members


[16-Jul-24 10:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Our current system allows me as an established player to buy at higher prices from new players, or offer some things for free.. in a way the CX interface doesn't allow. (If someone is buying BMFs at 10k, I can't sell them for free to that person, and vice versa)


[16-Jul-24 10:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
it could also play an aspect with volume


[16-Jul-24 10:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
instead of having to auction FF and create 9 contracts of varying amounts to 9 people


[16-Jul-24 10:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. Other than some slight sub-economy megalomania, my main hope for a corporate CX is just to reduce the work to sell things to you all. I’d settle for a corp LM too


[16-Jul-24 10:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I just put it on the CX


[16-Jul-24 10:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can sell it all for sure, because it's a lower price


[16-Jul-24 10:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, what sidepipe said


[16-Jul-24 10:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, I'm not a stickler about it, and I generally agree that it's a wash if we are all giving each other discounts, and we don't reaaaaally have anyone who only buys at corp prices and sells at external prices, so it all works out. Happy either way


[16-Jul-24 10:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
😄


[16-Jul-24 10:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
The volume thing is pretty valuable, and if it saves clicks it's amazing in my book


[16-Jul-24 10:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
just taking the motion making system and putting it in contracts would be very nice

{Reactions}
💯 (2) 

[16-Jul-24 10:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Notice there's a lot fewer save buttons on that one too!


[16-Jul-24 10:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Preferential stockpiles is the most important aspect. Like if there's no iodine in the real CX, and there is in the corp CX, that's a big win for all of us from the view of availability.


[16-Jul-24 10:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think our corp regularly passes around quantities of things that exceed the CX offer quantity


[16-Jul-24 10:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
so availability is way more important than price in that case


[16-Jul-24 10:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh here’s an idea - corporate ownership of WARs? With a corp context to send contracts to individual members?


[16-Jul-24 10:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
the government needs to own WARs first


[16-Jul-24 10:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the storefront system


[16-Jul-24 10:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
sell items to government, they're now in the gov WAR, then the gov can apply those to POPI as needed


[16-Jul-24 10:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
preferably without motions


[16-Jul-24 10:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, the gov contexts are what got me thinking of that originally. The storefront system for a gov would be a nice thing to have for a corp too, if you could limit access to it to members


[16-Jul-24 10:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Heck, if you could buy and sell from a government, we could use one of the OS planets for that 😄


[16-Jul-24 10:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I figured it'd be restricted to POPI and COGC


[16-Jul-24 10:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
those kinds of items


[16-Jul-24 10:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
and no buyback


[16-Jul-24 10:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
thought perhaps there could be a motion to move items around in case the WAR gets filled up or something


[16-Jul-24 10:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
No, that totally makes sense and you’re most likely right


[16-Jul-24 10:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I really do hope they do some sort of storefront, or at least allow the gov to fill POPI and COGC - it’d be nice to have a single place to do that transparently


[16-Jul-24 10:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
a shared WAR would make so many things soooo easy

{Reactions}
🤔 

[16-Jul-24 10:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Put one on malahat and just take some FIM when you are low, drop in the EDC


[16-Jul-24 10:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean I guess you might get the eve online heists


[16-Jul-24 10:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
But then I’d be out of a job 😱

{Reactions}
🥲 😆 

[16-Jul-24 10:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nah it would just be a really easy job


[16-Jul-24 10:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably add a transaction log


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
the game already tracks it all anyways


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Corporate MOTS to send stuff from the shared WAR?


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
nah that's really just a corporate WAR then


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or to accept contracts sent to it? But I guess that’s pretty much me with extra steps


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
shared would be more transparently accessed I think


[16-Jul-24 10:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think corporate context shows up when corporations can own things


[16-Jul-24 10:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
like CXs, or jumpgates or space elevators, and then can levy taxes on those things


[16-Jul-24 10:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
you need some kind of hierarchy to determine those taxes


[16-Jul-24 10:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why I figured it'd show up after this next update, because they're clear that they're doing government owned things first


[16-Jul-24 10:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I assumed that's because they don't wanna tack on the need to do the corporate context stuff in the same release


[16-Jul-24 10:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
so hopefully the release following (January?)


[16-Jul-24 10:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
right now there's just nothing for a corporation to own


[16-Jul-24 10:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
besides vanity buildings


[16-Jul-24 10:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm sure. It's tough to say because they say "the first iteration" a lot


[16-Jul-24 10:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
"The first iteration of multi-part contracts won't feature multi-part sell contracts" -> Doesn't imply the next thing they will work on is that


[16-Jul-24 10:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Likewise for allowing governments to change currency


[16-Jul-24 10:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hard to say which things they mentioned in the gateway blog post will be coming in "the first iteration"


[16-Jul-24 10:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
true, they have a never ending backlog of things to `improve`


[16-Jul-24 10:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
that might take literal years to be acknowledged

{Reactions}
👆 

[16-Jul-24 10:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really have interest in recurring contracts, but some people are all about them


[16-Jul-24 10:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
and that one dates back to before my time I think


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
they have a tendency to say "good enough" I think


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm not sure there's a lot of places where they just abandon an idea halfway


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
rather, it just comes out half-baked instead


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's an attempt to spread around the limited dev effort


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
since there's something strange going on there with how their funding system works


[16-Jul-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah


[16-Jul-24 10:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know they are also working on the airline sim


[16-Jul-24 10:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I wonder if they also do contract work or regular jobs too or something


[16-Jul-24 10:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
it doesn't seem like it, I think molp works this full time with counterpoint as a part-time project manager


[16-Jul-24 10:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
just because of how they talk about vacations


[16-Jul-24 10:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah sure.


[16-Jul-24 10:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
though it being Germany, seems like there's a vacation every week 😄


[16-Jul-24 10:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah heh


[16-Jul-24 10:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely a different work culture


[16-Jul-24 10:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
But sometimes the weekly dev blogs were like "oh we thought about this feature", or "oh we fixed this bug on monday". Which is what our game blogs would look like when we were part time on contract work


[16-Jul-24 10:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
could be because of an alternating schedule with the airlinesim and prun?


[16-Jul-24 10:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
I absolutely hated writing blog posts and tweets, so I would do three weeks of posts at a time and then auto post them


[16-Jul-24 10:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaah that’s probably more likely


[16-Jul-24 10:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
my projects never have that kind of public exposure, so not familiar myself


[16-Jul-24 10:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaah it’s rough. Cause you gotta do all the posts before people start reading the posts. But at first, you’re writing them and it seems like nobody is reading them.


[16-Jul-24 10:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
if you use Capital One though, you've used software I wrote 😛


[16-Jul-24 10:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ooh I do! But I never went to look for their dev blog 😁


[16-Jul-24 10:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I'm sure it'd be terrible if they published one haha


[16-Jul-24 10:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
“ what’s new with your self service credit card login!”


[16-Jul-24 11:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
“ Please just show me my balance and don’t try to upsell me any card features”


[16-Jul-24 11:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d read it just to be horrified at what was going wrong in the first place 😁

😆 

[16-Jul-24 11:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'd be impressed


[16-Jul-24 11:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
so much falls back on manually fixing issues when something goes wrong, though to my understanding, CapOne is pretty good about it compared to some banks


[16-Jul-24 11:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
In the one live stream they did I did get a vague impression that Airline Sim was still the bigger game.  But I don’t remember why.


[16-Jul-24 11:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it’s been around much longer - wasn’t it their first game?


[16-Jul-24 11:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I think they said its revenue was significantly higher than prun


[16-Jul-24 11:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
looking at it, I can see why. You have to use airline credits for each day you play, and they're not cheap


[16-Jul-24 11:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
and they run various kinds of servers


[16-Jul-24 11:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
and they only last like 6 months max I think


[16-Jul-24 11:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
It looks cool, but I’ve heard it’s hard to get into and there’s lots of competition / PvP


[16-Jul-24 11:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
some will have speed x3, and be more expensive, that kind of stuff. Reminds me of old Tribal Wars


[16-Jul-24 11:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you get the right audience they can really really spend.


[16-Jul-24 11:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like the train simulator games on steam.


[16-Jul-24 11:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess it’s probably cheaper than actual model trains.

$20 a train…. 700 DLC items


[16-Jul-24 11:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
For flight sims DCS world is similarly priced I think.


[16-Jul-24 11:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I can totally imagine airline sim players dropping hundreds.


[16-Jul-24 11:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[17-Jul-24 04:00 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv tried to get into it but as its direct competition, it is very difficult to break in because the players there have it down to a science so there is very little room to learn the game


[18-Jul-24 01:22 AM] melon164#0000
Well this is fun 🙂

Ideally I’d like to put down similar bases on the other planets, but maybe I should wait a couple of weeks?


[24-Jul-24 10:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
POPI reports hit on the other two planets in a few hours. I think they will all be in similar shape


[30-Jul-24 04:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
So once I get kicked out of Nike governor, I'm gonna look into what planets make sense out here besides the 3 best ones


[30-Jul-24 04:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
so we can build a real secondary economy


[30-Jul-24 04:28 PM] hernanduer#0000

I'm going to put a 1000-SET PPF base on OS-099b this week.  Hopefully there'll be enough SET by then that I won't create any vaccancies


[30-Jul-24 05:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
They all roll over tomorrow. I think SET count isn't too high so that's a good plan. It probably won't fill all 1000 but it won't cause vacancies for anyone else since their number is less than yours


[30-Jul-24 05:40 PM] melon164#0000
exactly


[30-Jul-24 05:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
all 4 planets are at 100% safety, health, comfort, and culture, so they should skyrocket (as much as they can, at least)

OS-476d - 8th best O - liquid


[31-Jul-24 11:33 AM] akyantor#0000
An interesting collection tbh


[31-Jul-24 11:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
it really is


[31-Jul-24 11:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
I am just looking at tap quality though, not whole output from a base, so liquid vs gas/solid isn't being factored in here


[31-Jul-24 11:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
doesn't matter for minerals and ore, but could for the "gas" category


[31-Jul-24 11:40 AM] hernanduer#0000
okay I fixed it - looks like that O was liquid too so that's great!

GK-462b - 6th best BRM

GM-037a - 4th best ALO


[31-Jul-24 11:47 AM] akyantor#0000
Doesn't look like there's a good source of H, otherwise you could get a nice CL farm going 😛


[31-Jul-24 11:48 AM] katinga#0000
I have H.  Do you need H?


[31-Jul-24 11:48 AM] akyantor#0000
I meant over in the area of project 6115


[31-Jul-24 11:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Not specifically in need at the mo


[31-Jul-24 11:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
WU-882i is 11th best, and NJ-215f is still a pretty good tap (not gonna count that one's rank 🙂 )


[31-Jul-24 11:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
but yeah, nothing in the near vicinity, it looks like


[31-Jul-24 11:50 AM] katinga#0000

[31-Jul-24 12:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But it is also used up in a lot of things like Water and carbon compounds and isn’t elemental H


[31-Jul-24 12:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think GM-498a is better than 14th best H2O planet. Were gas and solid H2O appropriately reduced?


[31-Jul-24 01:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's 14th in prunplanner, but PB-132c, which is first, is solid. So you have to cut that down by half. or more. I don't remember, I calculated it once and it was a big reduction in H2O per unit area.


[31-Jul-24 01:02 PM] katinga#0000
does the game have a process for splitting water into its elements?


[31-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah, the true value on the liquid or gas/solid ones I didn't calculate, just went by fio


[31-Jul-24 01:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
sadly N isn't even nearby in any quantity, so it's really only O and H2O that need that consideration


[31-Jul-24 01:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's more like 6th best water, or something

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Jul-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the O is technically 5th best


[31-Jul-24 01:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
lol no, GM-498a is actually 3rd best, damn


[31-Jul-24 01:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
I made a thread where further updates can be made


[31-Jul-24 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No electrolysis at the moment😩


[31-Jul-24 01:24 PM] katinga#0000
that would be so easy to add to the game, you would think


[31-Jul-24 01:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah easy recipe in CHP or something


[31-Jul-24 01:28 PM] melon164#0000
Very hard to balance without energy though


[31-Jul-24 01:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
@archielvahr can you generate a map with planets that only need SEA? similar to the one from before that was only 3 green?

[31-Jul-24 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you know your building count, I can get per planet prices. But  everything out there is HSE or AEF basically... plus ins

distance 3: 
 GM-212c            HYF Base Cost: 1960k  High Press (HSE), 
  GM-212d            HYF Base Cost: 1960k  High Press (HSE),


[31-Jul-24 01:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
those are good candidates, HSE might be cheaper than INS


[31-Jul-24 01:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
especially if you did ASMs


[31-Jul-24 02:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
Looking to get a bunch of SMEs down on one and ASMs on another


[31-Jul-24 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
One of those is the FEO planet, so that's already gonna be more SMEs


[31-Jul-24 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
212d


[31-Jul-24 02:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
212c would make sense for ASMs that helps with intrasystem movement of FE, then maybe somewhere a bit farther for the 2nd SME base


[31-Jul-24 02:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mixing SMEs and ASMs might reduce back and forth shipping and make the population mix easier to achieve.


[31-Jul-24 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
Good points, so two half/half planets.


[31-Jul-24 02:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
GK-619d is sea only


[31-Jul-24 02:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can make a larger list if you want. Or filter it down


[31-Jul-24 02:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
Even just filtering down to nearest to 099 with a single red bar would be helpful

6 jumps gets pretty far away though, if you are planning on bringing it back and forth that way 🤷‍♂️


[31-Jul-24 02:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Very nice


[31-Jul-24 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
For the metals, yeah not sure... It's almost all metallurgy working with ASM parts


[31-Jul-24 02:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
And there isn't any allotment for metallurgy on any of the 3 main planets


[31-Jul-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I guess you can dump ore into SME+ASM+SKF and end up with relatively small outputs.


[31-Jul-24 02:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
416b is good, but kind of opposite direction of the ore planets


[31-Jul-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
We could change those COGCs if we have a compelling enough use


[31-Jul-24 02:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think 1 electronics, 1 manufacturing and 1 metallurgy would be slick, then an intrasystem ship will really get all its worth


[31-Jul-24 02:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
But I'd recommend FS on that planet rather than ASM, to support the electronics and manufacturing


[31-Jul-24 02:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
Same with electronics, it should probably be mostly ELP or CLR, rather than SD or SEs


[31-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
And then manufacturing would be SCA and MCAs


[31-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
Only problem is lack of gold anywhere around


[31-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
Would have to truck in ore from Elon or something


[31-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's what I'd do though, not sure what everyone's thoughts are


[31-Jul-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here's a new map, they are colored by the number of single or zero red-bar planets. But it doesn't differenciate on type of red bar:


[31-Jul-24 02:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
So OS-803 looks amazing but it's a bunch of gas planets. Oh they are also cold


[31-Jul-24 02:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
that should be two "red bars"


[31-Jul-24 02:26 PM] archielvahr#0000

I suspect it might be best to not do it now to avoid attention, but for what it's worth I have a credit to name a system. If we get things going for project 6115, would be happy to use it to name OS-099 something fun, if folks were interested.


[02-Aug-24 11:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
Is there a greek god of capital management? 😄


[02-Aug-24 11:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ooh yeah save that naming right 😄


[02-Aug-24 11:48 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd think we'd want to be established before doing it, but happy to save it up


[02-Aug-24 11:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm sure we can come up with something creative and cool


[02-Aug-24 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
I wonder if there's a good theme for something far away, underworld themed or something unique

flipped through that a bit


[02-Aug-24 11:50 AM] akyantor#0000
maybe something exploration or adventure related, might also fit


[02-Aug-24 12:24 PM] akyantor#0000
TARTARUS - The god of the deep abyss, a great pit in the depths of the underworld, and father of Typhon.


[02-Aug-24 11:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
tartarus is also associated with Hell since he's the god of basically a afterlife prison


[03-Aug-24 01:44 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, bad choice

[03-Aug-24 09:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
There's a bunch of afterlife / hades themed gods that I think are unused in PRUN so far. If we go with a darkness or primodial theme:
Erebus, Moros, Oneiroi, Tartarus, all on the darker side


[03-Aug-24 10:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Dark theme isn’t necessarily bad


[03-Aug-24 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
Do we want to clarify the COGC for the 099 planets? Now that we know about gates, I think we can more confidently say they can be other than just electronics


[03-Aug-24 11:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm for:
099a - Construction
099b - Chemistry
099c - Manufacturing
099d - Electronics
099e - Metallurgy


[03-Aug-24 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's a really good question. I don't really have an opinion about A or E. I'm likely going to keep mostly electronics on B and C. I actually put a ton of PPFs on C already to balance out the population


[03-Aug-24 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah D and C are both manufacturing at the moment


[03-Aug-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have been expecting to change my building layout as the pop grows


[03-Aug-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I think I'll go with whatever works, as long es people are interested enough in each COGC out there.


[03-Aug-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Electronics will always make sense.


[03-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
On Chemistry CHPs probably won't make much sense unless we add resource taps. LABs have lots of long running stuff so that'd be great.


[03-Aug-24 12:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, typically those run on the planets where extraction occurs


[03-Aug-24 12:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
Was surprised it's there but I'm not against setting up some AML and LAB in the main system


[03-Aug-24 12:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
My plan is to start with resource extraction planets to build into the later ones, just because we still have a good amount of time before gateways are gonna be working


[03-Aug-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
Gonna need a couple new WCB ships for my needs, I'm working towards them myself


[03-Aug-24 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
EvoV makes ships and recently said he has like parts for 20 of them


[03-Aug-24 12:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
We could think about doing a bulk buy


[03-Aug-24 12:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
maybe a discount there.


[03-Aug-24 12:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been thinking about selling ships on commission too. Someone gets 100k per ship they sell.. they can sell without the OOG tag. Once they seal the deal, the ship parts come from me


[03-Aug-24 12:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Works if we have more suppliers especially


[03-Aug-24 12:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That’s interesting!


[03-Aug-24 12:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Or you sell them at a bulk price and they make their money if they are able to sell higher


[03-Aug-24 12:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im sure Dust would be very interested, all they do is trade


[03-Aug-24 12:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
They would either buy them for them or they would be able to turn them around


[05-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I had too many Tech immigrations queued up I guess. So OS-099d might end up with more techs. I don't think I already used them up, there might be unemployed ones after this unless somone built a base there to use them


[08-Aug-24 02:28 AM] melon164#0000
I just misclicked and built a base on OS-099b, but didn't change the random base location.  No worries, I'll just demolish it and rebuild it at the pole like a normal obsessive.  "Insufficient cash".  Most expensive 15s base ever 🤦‍♂️ 😡


[08-Aug-24 02:28 AM] melon164#0000
Can I borrow 10M ICA for a few days?!!  😳


[08-Aug-24 02:29 AM] melon164#0000
(actually I only need 5M more)


[08-Aug-24 07:33 AM] melon164#0000
Ok, I scrounged up enough currency.  Now I just need my _twenty_ million back 😝

[09-Aug-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Somewhat related to Project-6115, at least in spirit... My HEX tap would be ready for a second base in about a week if anyone is interested. It's probably a terrible idea though. 

It does have a 10m base establishment fee, which is refundable for OOG members.

We could also grab other unoccupied HEX taps if anyone wants in on that.


[09-Aug-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am out of permits for silly shenanigans 😄


[09-Aug-24 05:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
20m sent. You can ping me to close the other end of the contract

[16-Aug-24 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
We should probably look at finalizing those COGCs. I put down mostly electronics, but some chemistry on B and some manufacturing on D.

Hern's suggestion was:

099a - Construction
099b - Chemistry
099c - Manufacturing
099d - Electronics
099e - Metallurgy

Sidepipe has chem and melon has manuf on B. Melon has manuf on C. I think it's just me on D right now.


[16-Aug-24 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
But it's easy to rework bases at this point


[16-Aug-24 10:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
As long as we end up with one electronics base, I’m happy 😄


[16-Aug-24 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also for people who are interested in getting involved in the system but aren't here yet: which ones do you want to see?


[16-Aug-24 10:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t mind retooling my base on B as needed


[16-Aug-24 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am still a bit enamored with the mega-electronics idea. But LABs and POLs have worked well. I don't reaaaallly imagine i'll do smelting out there


[16-Aug-24 11:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
Can we negotiate for 2 electronics bases? 😄


[16-Aug-24 11:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
099a for electronics 2?


[16-Aug-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
definitely want a chemistry base as one of them though


[16-Aug-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
construction is the one I care least about... hah


[16-Aug-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
What are your metallurgy plans in the region?


[16-Aug-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
(like construction is a good way to reduce the shipping weight of metallurgy stuff, but maybe you are just shipping raw metals out? You can't really use them up in manufacturing or anything else, can you?)


[16-Aug-24 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, so here's one propsal (will wait for a round of feedback from everyone ) 
099a - Electronics (2nd)
099b - Chemistry
099c - Manufacturing
099d - Electronics
099e - Metallurgy
GM-498a - H2O Extraction (already in place)
GM-332c - ---chemistry--- resource extraction (LST)
AU-605c - Food processing (already in place)


[16-Aug-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
GM-332c is INS and HSE, but GM-332b  is only INS. I aaume you need the LST?


[16-Aug-24 02:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm making 332c RE rather than Chem


[16-Aug-24 02:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
because it's the #1 or #2 LST mine


[16-Aug-24 02:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't wanna shy away from that, in case someone wants to do that


[16-Aug-24 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
and I'm mining the HAL, it has I think 10% more HAL than YK-005d


[16-Aug-24 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
metallurgy plans are to setup at least an AST/FET chain


[16-Aug-24 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably need to wait for gates for that


[16-Aug-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
so chemistry for now has me making GM-332c into RE for HAL, 099b will have some LAB, CHP and POL


[16-Aug-24 02:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
which I can then take back to ANT for construction on Aceland, or move TCL/PG over to 099c for KV/NL

Got some milestones! No open jobs on C (manuf) and D (electronics). Still lots of Jobs on B (chemistry). We are getting capped a little by life support, nothing we can do about that unfortunately. 

Next steps: Planet D needs a university so we can get passive growth started for engs and scientists. I will put down a few SEs so the engineers have open jobs to move into. 

If we want electronics on planet A, someone could start that, I'm out of permits for the moment.

[31-Aug-24 09:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Oops sorry


[31-Aug-24 09:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
weirdly I had the other ones fine 🤷‍♂️


[31-Aug-24 09:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
Did we all forget to vote? 😄


[31-Aug-24 09:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ll remember next time for sure


[31-Aug-24 09:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah my mistake was starting the planets ADMs one after another, should have done them all at the same time. Instead they are like 6 hrs apart


[04-Sep-24 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of growth in today's reports. Still have open jobs on B and C though.


[10-Sep-24 03:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ant -> EW-238c -> GM-498a -> OS-099


[10-Sep-24 03:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
EW-238c has a decent HAL site, 498a is the 3rd best H2O in universe


[10-Sep-24 03:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
both have small populations


[10-Sep-24 03:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
cost about uhhh 1 billion AIC


[10-Sep-24 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
lmao


[10-Sep-24 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
So.... #bank-of-oog  😆


[10-Sep-24 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
we need about 5k TSH, 2k ABH, 1k ASE/ADE/ATA...


[10-Sep-24 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
and tens of thousands of the new RHO


[10-Sep-24 03:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
let's GO 😄


[10-Sep-24 03:16 PM] akyantor#0000
EW-238c isn't a half bad FE planet either, not a bad connection for an area without many good FE options.


[10-Sep-24 03:16 PM] akyantor#0000
A good connection to have with only one jump to the CX


[10-Sep-24 03:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah but just near GM-498a is the #1 FEO planet


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
sorry, #2


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
GM-212d


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaaaaaaaaah but no one wants to haul FEO _or_ FE


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] akyantor#0000
😛


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
At least RHO gets smaller when you smelt it, right?


[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
you would if you had a 5k/5k

{Reactions}
💯 👆 

[10-Sep-24 03:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
sooo much smaller


[10-Sep-24 03:18 PM] archielvahr#0000

[10-Sep-24 03:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
102.4t RHO turns into 16t RHE


[10-Sep-24 03:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
if they're on planets with just abysmal taps though, it's gonna make sense to run RE rather than Metal COGC

[10-Sep-24 03:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
`One of the rarest ores to be found throughout the known universe.` 🤔


[10-Sep-24 03:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
could be like 3planets, could be lots with basically no quality tap


[10-Sep-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Once we know the ratios, we might want to set up a pair of bases then, or 2 EXTs + 1 SME base, so we can get experts going


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
probably no quality tap


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
just few planets doesn't make sense


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Why not?


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
it does if they put them way out there


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
requiring you to haul it


[10-Sep-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe we'll get lucky and it'll be near OS


[10-Sep-24 03:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
So devs intentionally would make it hard for a already hard project? Plus political fights for the planets


[10-Sep-24 03:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
of course! you want our quality RHO tap, 1 of only 3 planets? Pay the 10mil 😄


[10-Sep-24 03:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
that'll fund some gates

{Reactions}
😅 

[10-Sep-24 03:22 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
How long after putting down the first base on a planet is the governor elected? Could we secure the sources?


[10-Sep-24 03:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
first ADM election is 3 days


[10-Sep-24 03:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
it resolves in 3 days


[10-Sep-24 03:23 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So you don’t have to be first just have the most people?


[10-Sep-24 03:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
in those 3 days, yeah


[10-Sep-24 03:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Cause if we wanted to take the competing route. We could set crazy taxes for everyone and take the profit?


[10-Sep-24 03:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
I like the way you're thinking


[10-Sep-24 03:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's basically what we're doing with this project anyways


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] marat_sh#0000
This is like setting your player base against each other... 👀


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's competition


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
😄


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] katinga#0000
I'll be setting up a base.  I am probably going to close down my base on Life.  RHO looks like a good alternative


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We can make it prohibitively expensive for others


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Need to have 100t ship with ADM + CM resources ready


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think 100t ship with HYR can get pretty ridiculous


[10-Sep-24 03:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
like from Ant to OS-099 in 8 hours?


[10-Sep-24 03:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
do you have one Smith?


[10-Sep-24 03:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Not even, we don’t have to be first just the most in the first 3 days


[10-Sep-24 03:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
max speed 2k/2k still takes more than 3 days to get to the south of the map from the middle


[10-Sep-24 03:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe if you pitstop and refuel from storage on FF?


[10-Sep-24 03:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We’d have to see where the taps are


[10-Sep-24 03:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah


[10-Sep-24 03:27 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But I’m down to dedicate my ships for a week for that


[10-Sep-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
pre-station ships spaced evenly around our region 😄


[10-Sep-24 03:27 PM] katinga#0000
rho rho rho your boat gently down the stream


[10-Sep-24 03:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's what I was thinking


[10-Sep-24 03:28 PM] mrsmith33#0000
yea


[10-Sep-24 03:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
can you place a base through a shipping contract?


[10-Sep-24 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. Build a warehouse. They are almost free.


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
No I mean for sniping RHO planet 😅


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
I assume there will be no warehouses


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If we are set on it, we can take all of them…


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Whoever gets to the planet first can drop a warehouse (WAR not STO), then contract stuff to other players to instantly build bases there


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We spread out some ships and rush once it revealed


[10-Sep-24 03:30 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Each carrying several bases worth of stuff


[10-Sep-24 03:30 PM] katinga#0000
I keep some FF at Elon since it's close to Romulus


[10-Sep-24 03:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was meaning the ship carries its own fuel but not in FL storage


[10-Sep-24 03:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
but the LCB or whatever


[10-Sep-24 03:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
It doesn't really matter if you strand your ship getting onto the planet. We can send rescue ships.


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I just mean if it's all the way south, you'll hit 100% of fuel use trying to path there in 1 go


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
meaning you go slower


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can free up 3-5 permits of we want to make a serious go at it


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
you want to close to 100% on a given path, drop from FTL, refuel, then go again


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
we have a month or two probably, so no rush


[10-Sep-24 03:31 PM] katinga#0000
I just imagined an OOGer running out with a 5 gal gas can


[10-Sep-24 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
We should recruit up a bit too. I think we are a little light on shipbuilding efforts, so  adding people would be nice.


[10-Sep-24 03:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was waiting til I had better resources for new players


[10-Sep-24 03:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe I can rope someone else into writing "getting started bases in OOG".


[10-Sep-24 03:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
we normally save that for the new hires at my jobs

[10-Sep-24 03:35 PM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Sep-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I Hope this will bring out a bit of competition between corps


[10-Sep-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We need more capitalism


[10-Sep-24 03:56 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

thats enough to lock down a planet lol


[10-Sep-24 04:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
even more than a 10mil fee


[10-Sep-24 04:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
we can just rembourse ourselves and split the excess


[10-Sep-24 04:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah then you just have to remember the reimburse your allies

Election end in 17 days 11h


[16-Sep-24 01:30 AM] melon164#0000
I'll come put a CLR base on OS-099d to do MTC, soak up all those unused SET


[16-Sep-24 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
awesome 😄


[16-Sep-24 07:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
I've just realized there is a tiny weakness, which can be exploited if need be in the future


[16-Sep-24 07:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
In regards to the 10mil base fee


[16-Sep-24 07:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
If a group of players wait until the final 24 hours of an election and then put down all their bases, followed by voting for their own guy in that election, they'd be able to recover all of their funds


[16-Sep-24 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
Because you can't propose any motions in those final 24 hours, you can't take out the money they paid


[16-Sep-24 07:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that's one way to organize a planet-stealin' if you wanted to do that


[16-Sep-24 07:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Archy and I were (semi-seriously) talking about organizing a maneuver like that on one of Firefreak's 10 IDC planets 😄


[16-Sep-24 07:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
but hopefully we'll have the OS-099 planets populated enough that it'll at least be very expensive fun for whoever wants to try and come take one - you'd still need to front all the money for it


[16-Sep-24 07:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
that, plus hopefully the physical distance will help discourage that


[17-Sep-24 10:11 AM] zipatsu#0000
Is there any downside to preemptively creating a bunch of payout motions the day before the election ends to counter that? E.g just creating eight 10m payout motions to Archiel and then cancelling them after the election each time? Or are you also not able to fulfil the conditions of motions anymore in that 24h either?


[17-Sep-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
they time out eventually


[17-Sep-24 10:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
you could do that though, I think


[17-Sep-24 10:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you think it's gonna happen


[17-Sep-24 10:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
doing it every month would be a PITA


[17-Sep-24 10:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's interesting


[17-Sep-24 11:42 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Would come in handy in case of a play for monopoly of RHE planets


[17-Sep-24 11:42 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
In that case I can imagine people trying to snipe it


[19-Sep-24 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
Added a university to OS-099d. playin' the long game slowly getting engineers -> scientists


[21-Sep-24 04:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's a.... 

Project-6115 update!

* OS-099b Chemistry. We have extra pioneers and techs, really nice population growth. Probably ready for more people. I might need to add a PAR soon

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-Sep-24 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
* OS-099c: Manufacturing. We have 200 set and 300 techs that need jobs!
* OS-099d: Electronics. I am slowly growing the engineers. This has the lowest population, but there are some unemployed techs and a ton of settlers. If you wanna build here, lemme know and we can plan for the population change. I am just slowly adding Eng buildings to keep up with the growth


[22-Sep-24 09:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm going to take a look at what I'd need to make both BWS and MHP - if it makes sense, I might be able to move all the electonics stuff to OS-099d and maybe some of the inputs to OS-099c 🙂


[22-Sep-24 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000

[22-Sep-24 12:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
question - do we have a shipyard in OS-099?


[22-Sep-24 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
depending on how the electronics works out, it might be useful to have one to haul between 099c and 099d. I can toss in some cash to build one if there's interest 🙂


[22-Sep-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Not yet but I think we should make one


[22-Sep-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even just for unloading a pile on consumables in one system and having a puddle jumper to distribute them


[22-Sep-24 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm using my GM-332d base as a sort of staging ground to further things along to OS-099. If I build a base even further into the GM sector I might move it to there


[22-Sep-24 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I stage one ship at that base perpetually, then another ferrys things between ANT and the base


[22-Sep-24 02:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
it saves the 8 hours, making the trip an easy even-2days instead of the 2days+8hours


[22-Sep-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am saving a permit for gateway stuff, but if I get another, I would add another electronics base on OS-099a


[25-Sep-24 09:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm in the final stages of putting together my OS-099 BWS plan - looks like i'd need about 740 SET, 100 TEC on 099c and 200 SET, 200 TEC on 099d - do you think that would be workable? It doesn't matter if it takes some time to grow the pops, because these bases won't be perfectly balanced until they hit 5 experts anyway 😄


[25-Sep-24 09:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
Will gladly contribute cash for programs 🙂


[25-Sep-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah those are in place on c (move fast before the techs disappear, they have been dropping because of unemployment)


[25-Sep-24 09:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
and for d, that shoulld go pretty fast too.  Easy settelrs- those are already there. Techs shouldn't be too hard.


[25-Sep-24 09:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sweet, I should be out there in the next few days. Just trying to get my spreadsheet optimize the bases with order sizes < 7 days 😄


[26-Sep-24 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
Next week gonna drop 590 SET and 120 TECs on 099c


[26-Sep-24 12:09 PM] hernanduer#0000

I can bring my ship over from 332d


[26-Sep-24 12:13 PM] hernanduer#0000

[28-Sep-24 04:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
really excited for these two bases. the net import per day is really low, and it'll be really nice to have a consistent source of BWS for antares. and there's still 200ish area on the electronics base for other products

I've got 10M and the ships are getting there about 2 days apart, so I should be good!

[03-Oct-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
All the base establishment fees have been returned now 😅

{Reactions}
🙌 (2) 

[06-Oct-24 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, I think we're ready for another round of bases from other OOG members!

OS-099B is Chemistry
OS-099C is Manufacturing
OS-099D is electronics

They all have unemployed population now. The system works well for things where the shipping requirements are low. Chemistry base works great for LABs, I make NR there, but any LAB and many CHP products are a good option.

On c, manufacturing like PPFs are great. 

On d, low tier workers are quite available, so there's lots of techs for SDs or the various electronics factories. I am slowly increasing ENG counts now.

The base establishment fee is 10m ICA, but you get it back as soon as you ping me about it. If you are short on ICA, I can probably spot you the cash in advance.

I’ll be adding some more workers on 099D shortly - dropped my base, but haven’t put down buildings yet since I need all the inputs from C 😁


[06-Oct-24 04:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Speaking of which, @archielvahr - could I have my ICA back from 099d? 🙂

I’m also happy to spot anyone the base fee, just let me know!

I have more ships for sale 😉


[06-Oct-24 04:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m gonna try and start posting more shipping offers here when I make trips as well


[06-Oct-24 04:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Someone couuuuuuuld set up base teleports out here too.


[06-Oct-24 04:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Send the whole base in a contract, plus 30d or 60d of consumables.


[06-Oct-24 04:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am too poor for that 😅


[06-Oct-24 04:58 PM] marat_sh#0000

I could do with a full permit of labs somewhere… but need to finish paying back my last uber expansion first. 😉


[06-Oct-24 05:19 PM] akyantor#0000
Requires a new ship for me too, can’t afford for one to be awol for 6 days at a time.


[06-Oct-24 08:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
Took a couple extra days for the afabs but 099c ship will land Tuesday


[06-Oct-24 08:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
What would people think of putting together a list of bases in the OS-099 area? I'm kinda curious what folks are making (and what we spend the most m3/t shipping in) - there might be some opportunities to start a local economy in the future 😄


[06-Oct-24 09:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
OS-099 base list!

Next new permit is probably gonna go to the best RHE base


[06-Oct-24 11:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
Or RHO I guess


[07-Oct-24 01:10 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Waiting to see where they are, torn down my AL production so debaiting if I reserve my permits for that


[07-Oct-24 01:10 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Or just Afabs


[07-Oct-24 08:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
I wouldn't save any more than a single permit


[07-Oct-24 08:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
All of the RHE products are only like 20% of a gateway's base area costs


[07-Oct-24 04:10 PM] akyantor#0000
What ship configuration are folks using to transport stuff out to 099? Can you get away with a medium FTL fuel bay?


[07-Oct-24 04:11 PM] akyantor#0000
I think the simulator seems to suggest yes, if you have a quick charge engine, and medium fuel bay, but it takes 2.5 days one way.


[07-Oct-24 05:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mostly use my FSE / HYR ships to go out there, they are large/large fuel tanks, but standard ships don't really have trouble, esp if you bring extra FF


[07-Oct-24 07:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
it'll be real slow without an LFL


[07-Oct-24 08:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve noticed that I usually use more than 50% fuel with medium tanks, but I bring a bunch of extra with me every trip


[07-Oct-24 08:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
(so @ me if anyone gets stranded - I have a few thousand fuel on each base!)


[08-Oct-24 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
Apparently these new base materials are almost 8mil in value? Idk how

Are we still in the market for someone to use up Tech/Set on 099b? I need a full lab base, and trying to decide whether to go 099b or ZV-639d.


[15-Oct-24 02:03 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm pretty tempted to go 099b, as the ROI is a lot higher due to being all green. 🙂


[15-Oct-24 02:09 PM] mrsmith33#0000
LAB base would double the tech population on ZV-639d


[15-Oct-24 02:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'd have to fund some programmes and maybe popi there 🙂


[15-Oct-24 02:09 PM] akyantor#0000
I'll probably need to build a long range ship if I go 099b. 🤷‍♂️

Hyperborea
In Greek mythology, the Hyperboreans (Ancient Greek: ὑπερβόρε(ι)οι, romanized: hyperbóre(i)oi, pronounced [hyperbóre(ː)oi̯]; Latin: Hyperborei) were a mythical people who lived in the far northern part of the known world. Their name appears to derive from the Greek ὑπέρ Βορέᾱ, "beyond Boreas" (the God of the north wind) or "beyond Boreas". Some ...

Nyx - goddess of the night

Since it's very far to the south:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notus


[30-Oct-24 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Notus is the greek god of the south wind


[30-Oct-24 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I like the greek scheme too because it reenforces that this is an extension of antares


[30-Oct-24 04:53 PM] akyantor#0000
That's kind of fitting


[30-Oct-24 04:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
"Notus" isn't quite as good as "Nyx" or "Tartarus" as a word though, in my opinion. But It's nto bad.


[30-Oct-24 04:54 PM] akyantor#0000
Agreed

It does seem like Nyx has a bit of momentum. I think I probably prefer how it sounds over Tartarus, if honest.

I’ve got 149 at ANT, but that’s probably not enough to be useful


[18-Nov-24 11:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
I can buy more and bring it out if that helps, but I’ve only got my slow ships near ANT right now, so it might take two days

That's okay, if no one else has any, I can do that in the next couple days too.

Are there any plans to build a gateway to Nyx?


[03-Dec-24 04:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
So the devs said that "in the future" you can make corp owned infrastructure, including gateways


[03-Dec-24 04:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's no idea when "in the future" will be when they say stuff like that


[03-Dec-24 04:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I think that's a better match for some of those projects in some ways.


[03-Dec-24 04:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like probably no one can steal a gateway from a planet on Nyx, so from a control perspective we're fine there.


[03-Dec-24 04:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
The intermediate gates.. 🤷‍♂️


[03-Dec-24 04:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also the costs and upkeep costs are bonkers, now that they came out with upkeep costs.. I really wasn't expecting that


[03-Dec-24 04:34 PM] roche3950#0000
Taking a look through here — is this some sort of deep space initiative? 😄


[03-Dec-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
So... it'd take like 3 or 4 gates each direction to get to Nyx. We'd need like 100 people there to even begin considering it

[03-Dec-24 04:35 PM] roche3950#0000
I know I blathered on about system names to you Archiel but I came up with Something Better™️


[03-Dec-24 04:35 PM] roche3950#0000
Thanks!


[03-Dec-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
basically Nyx (formerly OS-099) is the only system in the game to have 3 triple green planets


[03-Dec-24 04:35 PM] roche3950#0000
Oh wow


[03-Dec-24 04:35 PM] roche3950#0000
Yeah uh


[03-Dec-24 04:36 PM] roche3950#0000
this, this right here
I’m in


[03-Dec-24 04:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you scroll though everything you can find discussions of other nearby resources, but after going over them there are a few options, basically we settled on the COGCs above.


[03-Dec-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
And I find it to be really good for low-shipping production. Labs, plastics / PPFs, and electronics


[03-Dec-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's a 10m base establishment fee, but we reimburse it


[03-Dec-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely happy to get more of our new folks out on the planets! Especially while you have cheap permits, it makes it easy 😄


[03-Dec-24 04:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
Upkeep is kinda wild not gonna lie. I assume that gate way will much closer to the planet (~5min to get to) and have near instant transfer speed (unless they already said something about speed)


[03-Dec-24 04:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah they said it will be "similar to a normal FTL jump". So I interpret that as... it saves 4 jumps of time by doing a single jump


[03-Dec-24 04:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
(or however many jumps were spanned)


[03-Dec-24 04:40 PM] roche3950#0000
I was actually looking at the PB sector for a deep space project way down the line, for funsies


[03-Dec-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
These are my setups, if you are looking for ideas

Are the next-door systems in wide use yet? Otherwise I may ask for an … arrangement with the devs ;p

[03-Dec-24 05:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
just need a lil bit


[03-Dec-24 05:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I made some AFPs and then I made 40 STS and figured I better make something else, so I'm gonna make a few cryo units


[03-Dec-24 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess we could build our immortality center


[03-Dec-24 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
they are pretty cheap these days


[03-Dec-24 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I doubt they will ever do anything though 🤷‍♂️


[03-Dec-24 05:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Build it on the edge of the universe


[03-Dec-24 05:07 PM] roche3950#0000
Only thing that is nerve-wracking at a glance is no big source of TCO


[03-Dec-24 05:07 PM] roche3950#0000
And a lot of HSE planets


[03-Dec-24 05:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah but I think the universe-wide requirement for TCO is pretty low, so I think it's more about finding one or two good chains than trying to be totally self sufficient out there.


[03-Dec-24 05:11 PM] roche3950#0000
Win conditions and all that 😄


[03-Dec-24 07:56 PM] tyrandia#0000
I love the system name.


[04-Dec-24 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's also this list here https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1268241763886436394/1268254935988965428


[04-Dec-24 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
I've already populated 332c and 332d, I use 332d as a staging area to cut off 8-12 hours going all the way to Nyx and instead dump things from Ant there


[04-Dec-24 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have a ship that ferries between my 4 planets out there and that ship sits on 332d


[04-Dec-24 12:03 PM] roche3950#0000
Hey team — wanted to make a proposal. 

@tyrandia and I are thinking of naming the planets in Nyx after some of the Slavic gods. It does break from the Greek theme we’ve tended to follow in Antares, however it could be a really cool addition and provide a bit of variety.

Propose the following:
Nyx b (chem) - **Svarog**
Nyx c (mfg) - **Perun**
Nyx d (elec) - **Veles**
Ideas/suggestions/commentary? 😄 

Note: yes, each player only gets one planet name by default, but we’d like to know if there is a third person that is interested in these planet names. Otherwise I might ask if the devs would kindly work with us on this.


[04-Dec-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
More names are always good! I googled em and they sound pretty cool. I am wondering about lining them up with the COGCs, but they don't have really strong associations. It says Svarog is associated with fire and blacksmithing. Not sure if that's closer to manufacturing or chemistry


[04-Dec-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah it sounds pretty cool to me


[04-Dec-24 12:25 PM] roche3950#0000
I mean, if we have a fourth person interested we could shift Svarog to a metallurgy world but I think it starts to be a very heavy ask with four people


[04-Dec-24 12:25 PM] roche3950#0000
four people who have *not yet whaled* asking them to whale


[04-Dec-24 12:28 PM] roche3950#0000
Unless I could strike some kind of deal to buy planet naming ‘tokens’ outright which I imagine would be met with a gracious but firm “no”


[04-Dec-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it would be nice if they could do that, but they don't seem to be in a rush to allow people to gift a subscription, which seems more important.... so who knows


[04-Dec-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
wouldn't hurt to ask 😄


[04-Dec-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if you are willing to wait, someone with a name will probably show up at some point.


[04-Dec-24 12:31 PM] roche3950#0000
Would lead to a slippery slope of custom support deals, and I imagine they don’t want to spend a lot of time on that


[04-Dec-24 12:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also due to the shipping requirements with metals, we've mostly avoided metallurgy out there thus far


[04-Dec-24 12:32 PM] roche3950#0000
which makes sense

[04-Dec-24 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
cause the ideal use case would be... EXT planet, SME planet, turn the metal into something small to ship to the CX. Might also need H2O planet + Agri planet + INC planet to help the SME along. Then what is the resulting product to ship back? maybe construction fabs? you'd probably also need chemistry. You could do AU and connectors, those ship great, but it's a lot of planets for a niche item.


[04-Dec-24 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
So you could ship up carbon and ship back SME products, but they aren't really rare/high margin enough to justify a 2d flight 🤷‍♂️


[04-Dec-24 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
But making NR out there is great 😄


[04-Dec-24 12:35 PM] roche3950#0000
Not to force my thinking onto it, but I’m largely imagining Nyx as a system where materials are being processed into final goods


[04-Dec-24 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup


[04-Dec-24 12:35 PM] roche3950#0000
maybe the last two worlds which I am reading as “planned” to be Metallurgy and Construction?


[04-Dec-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think some people had ideas for using them. Maybe Hern? Or Melon?


[04-Dec-24 12:40 PM] roche3950#0000
Think construction also plays nicely with mfg for shipbuilding


[04-Dec-24 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hern has Titanium and potentially LST there?


[04-Dec-24 12:41 PM] roche3950#0000
Yeah I think I saw a crazy TIO source not far away


[04-Dec-24 12:42 PM] roche3950#0000
I’d also just generally argue against a second elec planet


[04-Dec-24 12:42 PM] roche3950#0000
I’ve just had the sense that there will be terrible cases of Dutch disease sooner rather than later


[04-Dec-24 12:44 PM] roche3950#0000
Yeah GM-332d is the one


[04-Dec-24 12:46 PM] roche3950#0000
should I take this as an indication of interest 😄


[04-Dec-24 01:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
I do mine all my TIO on 332d


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's a very good TIO planet, I smelt a little there as well


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
and TIO is pretty friendly for LCBs even


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Any plans to smelt it / use it in Nyx?


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's the further plan


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
either 099a or e


[04-Dec-24 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
We could make SFK products or plates on Nyx actually


[04-Dec-24 01:28 PM] roche3950#0000
😄


[04-Dec-24 01:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
LCBs are only 200t and use 1000t of AST. So it is a shipping saving


[04-Dec-24 01:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah replacing Vulcan was kinda my hope (eventually)

{Reactions}
💯 

[04-Dec-24 01:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
then running ASMs out there with an SFK


[04-Dec-24 01:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
while the ASMs on Deimos deal with CTF and the like


[04-Dec-24 01:33 PM] katinga#0000
I mine and smelt TIO at SE-648


[04-Dec-24 01:39 PM] roche3950#0000
re: a construction planet
Also consider people can expand using locally built materials. Maybe I’m just impatient, but I’d like not waiting two days to do a thing if I could help it 😄


[04-Dec-24 06:01 PM] roche3950#0000
Alternatively we could use **Mokosh** for a chemical world


[04-Dec-24 06:03 PM] roche3950#0000
but perhaps best for an agro-world down the line

do stop me if I’m getting too rabbitholed, anyone 😄


[04-Dec-24 06:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will have to google that one when I get home


[04-Dec-24 06:05 PM] roche3950#0000
Only known through heavy inference to be sort of a life/nature goddess


[04-Dec-24 06:11 PM] roche3950#0000
And, fair warning, I am probably gonna get *way* too into encouraging colonization 😄


[04-Dec-24 07:32 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
If I settle on one of the undeveloped planets on Nyx, would anyone be willing to sponsor the planetary infrastructure costs?


[04-Dec-24 07:47 PM] roche3950#0000
that depends on the cogc you want :ablobgrin:


[04-Dec-24 07:49 PM] roche3950#0000
also I may or may not be planning like
six months out
lmfao


[04-Dec-24 10:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
You mean your production buildings? Probably! 

I've been doing the POPI buildings so far on all 3 planets, and the upkeep, but it hasn't been very expensive


[05-Dec-24 02:04 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
I was hoping just PAC, COGC, and maybe a warehouse, but if you’re willing to sponsor the production buildings too I’ll take it!


[05-Dec-24 05:48 AM] roche3950#0000
What do you want to do on the planet? Just interested as I’m doodling up some plans and want to make sure we’re inline


[05-Dec-24 06:05 AM] roche3950#0000
clarifying: i’m just really excited to get out there, i don’t mean to put pressure on anyone


[05-Dec-24 07:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh I missed the word “undeveloped” in your message


[05-Dec-24 07:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely can finish the other two


[05-Dec-24 07:01 AM] roche3950#0000
I still think a construction world would be really great 😄


[05-Dec-24 07:02 AM] roche3950#0000
I think if we can locally produce prefabs and redbar construction mats, it would be good for the area


[05-Dec-24 12:30 PM] roche3950#0000
Lots of potential mining worlds out there are just brutal, though 😦


[05-Dec-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I think having fabs up there has some value, but because you aren't constantly building / repairing, it's not too bad to ship them up. And I think you couldn't make all the variety everyone would need to be self sufficient (like all the bfabs, lfabs, rfabs, and afabs). Although it is a good way to "compress" metal. like if we set up AL out there and made lfabs, Rfabs need such a big mix of metals. that's what makes the SKFs appealing out there.


[05-Dec-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which planet and which cogc?  Nyx e and metallurgy?


[05-Dec-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nyx a is marked electronics, but with a compelling case I think we could change that


[05-Dec-24 12:48 PM] roche3950#0000
Could look into first making stuff for export before trying for self-sufficiency (again — my fixation, not something I am trying to force), yeah.


[05-Dec-24 12:48 PM] roche3950#0000
I may have spent a couple hours last night planning like 15-20 permits heh


[05-Dec-24 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's nice to have a plan 😄


[05-Dec-24 12:52 PM] roche3950#0000
Like I said, this was just something I was thinking about really hard in the first place.


[05-Dec-24 12:52 PM] roche3950#0000
I’d like to make a couple points for such a case 😄


[05-Dec-24 12:53 PM] roche3950#0000
We have quite a few really strong mining worlds within a few jumps


[05-Dec-24 12:54 PM] roche3950#0000
Having metallurgy and maybe construction on the last two planets would allow us to take advantage of those great natural resources


[05-Dec-24 12:56 PM] roche3950#0000
But there is a counterpoint to be made in just needing *so many* electronics buildings to integrate meaningfully


[05-Dec-24 12:57 PM] roche3950#0000
However, *discouraging* that (edit: that = single player electronics integration, encouraged by two worlds with elec cogcs) could encourage and provide gameplay opportunities for more people to come out to Nyx


[05-Dec-24 01:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh mostly the electronics out there could support IDC and EDC farming, which needs no integration and almost no shipping, leaving closer worlds in ANT free for those other types of electronics work. Not sure if that really changes the math, just that was the initial thought.


[05-Dec-24 01:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, I think everyone else should weigh in on their plans, cause we can definitely do more metal / const there, if there's enough interest


[05-Dec-24 01:11 PM] roche3950#0000
I think I mentioned my thoughts on I/EDC farming before 😛


[05-Dec-24 01:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
there is very little reason to go that distance for over 200t daily import/export


[05-Dec-24 01:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
IDC is like a no brainer


[05-Dec-24 01:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
maybe some chems and manufacturing


[05-Dec-24 01:20 PM] roche3950#0000
well the idea wouldn’t be to run back and forth from ANT every day but instead to develop local resources

[05-Dec-24 01:29 PM] roche3950#0000
also my boss said nice things about me so Operation Name All The Things is a go


[05-Dec-24 01:30 PM] shinonomesciences#0000

[05-Dec-24 01:31 PM] roche3950#0000
though Svarog would probably be reallocated to a metallurgy world if one is made


[05-Dec-24 01:31 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I just realized Perun is the name of a Slavic diety


[05-Dec-24 01:31 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I only know it from the defense youtuber


[05-Dec-24 01:33 PM] roche3950#0000
Hah


[05-Dec-24 01:33 PM] roche3950#0000
and a hell of a good one 🙂


[05-Dec-24 01:37 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I think Svarog should be the name of the manufacturing world, as a nice sister planet to Hephaestus given their mythological association


[05-Dec-24 01:38 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Well, I suppose metallury works too


[05-Dec-24 01:39 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Perun seems better for electronics given that it's nominally electricity after all


[05-Dec-24 01:40 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
That's my two cents anyway


[05-Dec-24 01:43 PM] roche3950#0000
Ah, perhaps


[05-Dec-24 01:44 PM] roche3950#0000
I think Svarog is pretty on top for a metallurgy or mfg world, Perun is arguable for the electronics world


[05-Dec-24 01:45 PM] roche3950#0000
Veles for elec is more a play on magic and trickery


[05-Dec-24 01:47 PM] roche3950#0000
But I am open for rich, spirited debate to work out the very best schemes 😄


[05-Dec-24 01:52 PM] roche3950#0000
Perun for manufacturing may rest on starship components, a conventional “supreme goal”


[05-Dec-24 02:05 PM] roche3950#0000
Speaking of export/import — fuel resources besides GAL are the thing that we don’t seem to have strong extractors for in the area


[05-Dec-24 02:09 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I think fuel is reasonably importable


[05-Dec-24 02:09 PM] roche3950#0000
I agree


[05-Dec-24 02:10 PM] roche3950#0000
Just had a think about preventing dead flights


[05-Dec-24 08:06 PM] roche3950#0000
also
another cool idea for names, just sorta popped in my head; mythical creatures
Pegasus, Chimera, Minotaur, etc. thoughts?


[06-Dec-24 05:49 AM] roche3950#0000

(myself, I’m leaning towards the creatures now, but I’d like to start a project that the people want 😄)


[06-Dec-24 10:57 AM] zipatsu#0000
Creatures has my vote ✌️ (Saw the gods were all Slavic ones so quickly looked up some creatures: Azhdaya,  Stratim, Alkonost, Gamayun, Todorats. There's a bunch of nice looking names to be found there 😄 )


[06-Dec-24 10:58 AM] roche3950#0000
They are indeed Slavic gods ^^


[06-Dec-24 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000

I'm drawing up my Master Plan™️ for the millionth time


[06-Dec-24 09:08 PM] roche3950#0000
Figuring out what should be a genuine import vs. what I should actually try to produce locally

No gold nearby :dread:
edit: nearest meaningful gold deposit's just at Elon :Shibalaugh:


[06-Dec-24 10:57 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I set up a bunch of FS to produce BGO, and only realized afterwards how heavy gold was 😅 .


[06-Dec-24 11:16 PM] archielvahr#0000

[11-Dec-24 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a ADM / COGC I can send to Nyx planet E


[11-Dec-24 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have plans for a base there though, so someone else will need a base there to take governorship


[11-Dec-24 03:03 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I don't really have a good grasp on the Nyx economy, did you have anything specific in mind to produce on Nyx e?


[11-Dec-24 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was hoping you had a plan 😆


[11-Dec-24 03:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I had construction in my head, because I thought you or someone suggested that.  But I don't have plans to do anything there.

The original plan was: planet A -> electronics, planet e -> metallurgy.


[11-Dec-24 03:27 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh I was thinking specifically about metallurgy, but if you don’t mind a different cogc, I’ll take a look around at construction


[11-Dec-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have enough for two so if you can do two permits you can do one of each


[11-Dec-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
whichever has larger area buildings should go on planet A


[11-Dec-24 03:45 PM] roche3950#0000
What’s the actual range of gateways, anyway? No reason 😇


[11-Dec-24 03:53 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
What's your price for a pond hopper on nyx?

[11-Dec-24 03:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
25 parsecs. Hehe it takes 3 sets to get most of the way to Nyx. 4 if you want the whole route


[11-Dec-24 04:29 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
That sounds horrifically expensive


[11-Dec-24 05:24 PM] roche3950#0000
I want to connect Nyx to another part of space :)


[11-Dec-24 05:24 PM] roche3950#0000

[11-Dec-24 05:28 PM] roche3950#0000
Are people figuring out interstellar distance just by taking a known distance and scaling it?


[11-Dec-24 05:28 PM] roche3950#0000
or is there some calculation we can access somewhere


[11-Dec-24 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can use the gateway plotter on the OOG map


[11-Dec-24 07:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I calculate it from the system stars payload from Fio.

[11-Dec-24 09:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also... I can't build a ADM/COGC without a base, forgot about that


[12-Dec-24 01:41 AM] melon164#0000
OS-099 <--> AU-709 <--> EW-238 <--> AntI or AntII


[12-Dec-24 01:43 AM] melon164#0000

[12-Dec-24 01:44 AM] melon164#0000

I think the capital cost would be achievable for us, long term. But the 500k per week upkeep makes the long term viability tough

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Dec-24 09:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
6 gates is 3m per week, so we'd need 100s of bases for the upkeep to be proportional to the time savings


[12-Dec-24 09:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
just the ZV-307 to EW-238 would save a bucket of time


[12-Dec-24 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. There's probably a handful of other people who would use that jump also


[12-Dec-24 04:03 PM] melon164#0000
How do you make these multi-hop images?  Is it a composite?


[12-Dec-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
nope, the new update allows you to make multiple

Click "Pathfinding", click the first system, click the second. It will draw the link.


[12-Dec-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Now it keeps drawing links as you click more, but you can click "Clear Gateways" to reset them.


[12-Dec-24 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if you want to draw 8 gates and mess up the 7th one, you gotta start over, sorry 😆

[12-Dec-24 08:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nah they aren’t out. That’s just a proposed path


[10-Jan-25 08:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr are you still interested in having someone take over on some of the Nyx planets? I saw the election on B just started


[10-Jan-25 08:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup!


[10-Jan-25 08:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Go for it


[10-Jan-25 08:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
They work great as a package deal if you want all three 😁


[12-Jan-25 11:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sounds good, I’ll jump into the elections as they come up - I have 3 bases there, so I make enough trips out that I’ll have space for COGC stuff 😄


[12-Jan-25 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Awesome thanks!


[12-Jan-25 11:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I will have a supply of cogc mats too if you run out ever


[12-Jan-25 11:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
Just ping me cause I probably won’t watch heh


[12-Jan-25 11:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
This is probably a good excuse to finally get my own STL ship out there 😄


[12-Jan-25 09:45 PM] roche3950#0000
What are you building out there, Archi? NR, right?


[13-Jan-25 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep NR on the chem planet, on the manufacturing planets I make DCS and other plastics


[13-Jan-25 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
and on the electronics planet I mostly make OS


[13-Jan-25 12:05 PM] roche3950#0000
I think I may want to make/name my megasystem near that. What are you generally importing? Maybe we can make it locally.


[13-Jan-25 12:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I import everything into Nyx. Which is really just PG, NCS, and EPO, or I make a little EPO and import a tiny bit of HAL on Nyx b, just so the ships don't fly up empty 😅


[13-Jan-25 12:27 PM] roche3950#0000
Duly noted!


[13-Jan-25 12:28 PM] roche3950#0000
🙂


[13-Jan-25 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have bases on 332c and 332d that provide me HAL and TIO, so my chem planet in 099 uses HAL that's locally sourced only


[13-Jan-25 01:15 PM] roche3950#0000
Locally sourced, grass fed?


[13-Jan-25 01:15 PM] roche3950#0000
I assume setting up for some consumables and supplies would be greatly appreciated (not to mention encouraging colonization)


[13-Jan-25 04:08 PM] katinga#0000
non GMO and Cage Free?


[13-Jan-25 04:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
The cages have not been genetically modified

EXT-to-CHM


[14-Jan-25 11:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
Workforce materials really aren't a big deal, running these planets has an expectation of taking some ships. I permanently have two ships on my 4, one goes from ant to 332d  and the other goes from 332d to the other 3 planets


[19-Jan-25 10:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr looks like you’re gov on Nyx B for another term 😆


[19-Jan-25 10:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I’m shipping out COGC mats and stuff so I can start picking up that and the POPI upkeep on B


[19-Jan-25 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
😭


[19-Jan-25 12:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
i forgot there were two seats for the planet, or I would have reminded you to drop out of the race 😅


[19-Jan-25 12:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I'll try to pick up everything so you only need to be the benevolent figurehead


[22-Jan-25 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr could you toss in some PE to the COGC on Nyx B? I managed to bring everything else but that


[22-Jan-25 06:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
not a big rush, it's still 7 days and I can definitely get some PE there by then, just thought I'd see if you had any 🙂


[22-Jan-25 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got it

{Reactions}
🫶 

[22-Jan-25 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
yup I got lots


[29-Jan-25 04:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr  - anything to know about the POPI on the different Nyx planets? I'm noticing that they're all filled slightly differently. Should I just carry on as they are right now? (safety and inf on B, safety, inf and art cafe on C, safety only on D)?


[29-Jan-25 04:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
uhhh that's entirely on accident 😅


[29-Jan-25 04:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
since we aren't currently growing them, they probably don't need to go super hard


[29-Jan-25 04:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
but DW in the cafe is cheap and easy 🤷‍♂️


[29-Jan-25 04:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
OFF isn't too expensive either


[29-Jan-25 04:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
maybe I'll just keep OFF and DW stocked in those building for each


[29-Jan-25 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
We should recruit other OOG people to come out here though, it's pretty great 😉


[29-Jan-25 04:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm gonna expand my operations out here to do BMF instead of BWS


[29-Jan-25 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
If I had more mental bandwidth, I'd probably sponsor bases out here


[29-Jan-25 04:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
since these are probably never gonna sell

I’m considering zeroing out all the taxes on the Nyx planets for the time being - it’s not much income, but the costs of the planet are so low that it’s basically not worth collecting anything for now


[14-Feb-25 09:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that'd be totally fine. I probably just didnt' want to type in a bunch of numbers

Any thoughts on opening up Nyx a bit? the system hasn't seen much action lately.


[24-Mar-25 12:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
hmmm, just need more corps interaction I think


[24-Mar-25 12:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I guess any interaction is fine as long as they pay the toll 😄


[24-Mar-25 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, maybe we need to advertise a bit more internally too


[24-Mar-25 12:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
Tax free IDC base on Nyx D anyone? 😄


[24-Mar-25 12:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
But if we do open up to externals, I might consider bringing taxes back


[24-Mar-25 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think so.


[24-Mar-25 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
