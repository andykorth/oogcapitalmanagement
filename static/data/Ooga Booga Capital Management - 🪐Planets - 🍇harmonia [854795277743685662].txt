@kimmyjiko how is the water and coffee production?


[01-Jul-21 08:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Looks like Harmonia is about to get an LM


[01-Jul-21 08:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kimmyjiko e could be a good market opportunity for you to offload some COF


[05-Jul-21 08:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Heard this on the United Faction Ops discord server

Sorry for the delay on the LM guys
While I'm in a hotel, I'm trying to set up getting my ship from Deimos back to Harmonia so I can build this thing for us.```


[05-Jul-21 08:42 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Sweet good to know

Gotch


[13-Jul-21 01:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol these guys are dropping the ball on the harmonia LM. It will happen eventually


[13-Jul-21 01:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kimmyjiko how much CAF/COF do you produce per day? assuming you have enough NS to keep it running


[20-Aug-21 08:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi @kimmyjiko There is money to be made from you two pooling cargo to Phobos. It is nice when the fuel cost is split 2-ways.


[20-Aug-21 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Not required but it is something to consider. If it helps I can facilitate getting some slow fuel on Phobos to guarantee you dont lose money on fuel.


[20-Aug-21 08:40 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Would this be direct to corp shipments?


[20-Aug-21 08:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Not required, although it opens the door for you to do commodities trading through a PRO account on the phobos LM


[20-Aug-21 08:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There may be opportunities where you would benefit from proxy access to the phobos LM. The downside is the PRO account needs to make 2 trades so net tax is around 110 AIC.


[22-Aug-21 05:38 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm definitely interested in buying RAT, DW, RCO and Carbs if there is a shipment to PHO. I can also provide you with cheap OVE, PWO, EXO and PT.


[25-Aug-21 09:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone Earthling is en-route to Harmonia with enough to build a vertical food industry base with 1 RIG, 2 FRM and 2 FP. This means we will have regular corporate shipping capacity between Phobos and Harmonia

@bitcoin_ape any DW up?


[12-Sep-21 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Only 60 in inventory and producing 240 in 3.7 days


[12-Sep-21 01:05 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Need 36 now


[12-Sep-21 01:05 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Or I can buy more later


[12-Sep-21 01:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You should buy on the LM if its urgent, unable to fill that


[12-Sep-21 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If this kind of situation is interrupting you we have talked about building an FP or just buying more DW on the market


[12-Sep-21 01:26 PM] sempyrfi#0000
No that's fine I have a few day's supply yet


[21-Sep-21 08:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi you have built some stuff on harmonia recently, right?


[21-Sep-21 08:15 PM] sempyrfi#0000
@bitcoin_ape 2 more FRMs, ETA 1 hr. C output will be doubled


[21-Sep-21 08:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nice. hopefully some extra RCO/GRN too

[10-Oct-21 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Shipping will also need to be arranged. Im not sure who is available to ship from harmonia to phobos.


[10-Oct-21 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling wont be there for another 4-5 days


[10-Oct-21 02:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm not in now hurry for RCO so that is fine for me.


[10-Oct-21 02:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK thats free shipping then üôÇ


[10-Oct-21 03:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
earthling will ~~make ~~ accept the shipping contract whenever its ready


[10-Oct-21 03:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So CX price avg. is 410 AIC, trading high is 401. I normally sold mine at 400.

[21-Dec-21 06:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
something like this would be good on Harmonia chat, if there are new players:

Looking to get my second base up on harmonia next. Just finished building my Deimos base to the first permit mark
DW and RAT costs are killing my profits.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[17-Jan-22 09:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We would subsidize this base, as a whole we are short on consumables and there is guaranteed demand for anything you make out there.


[17-Jan-22 09:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
starting with RAT + DW


[17-Jan-22 09:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also of course it would feed your workers


[17-Jan-22 09:01 PM] artokun#0000
That would be awesome, i think it could def help out the corp for sure


[17-Jan-22 09:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can build this whole base between our construction and manufacturing on Nike and Phobos.


[17-Jan-22 09:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
tomorrow we will coordinate it with @insensless72 @spatial_piano and whoever else can supply the needed fabs.


[17-Jan-22 09:12 PM] artokun#0000
I put together a plan for the end result base with a single permit

BMP and COL will not have a good return on this planet. I would recommend RIG + FRM + FP only


[17-Jan-22 09:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is more efficient with experts too. You can split 3 resource extraction, 3 food industry experts and still benefit from the 25% agriculture boost on harmonia

didn't even notice that menu before


[17-Jan-22 09:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with this setup, you almost always have options to spend extra H2O in order to move faster


[17-Jan-22 09:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so squeezing a few extra RIG will make you produce faster at the end of the day.


[17-Jan-22 09:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This base looks good. Depending on how much money you want to put down, we can start this with core module and 4-2-2 or 2-1-1 configuration


[17-Jan-22 09:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
basically 2 RIG or 4 RIG start depending on how many BSE and other fabs you want to start with


[17-Jan-22 09:27 PM] artokun#0000
i'll be putting all my profits into this


[17-Jan-22 09:27 PM] artokun#0000
which sadly, is about 18k per day


[17-Jan-22 09:27 PM] artokun#0000
worth of mats


[17-Jan-22 09:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It would be a crunch to come up with this complete 500/500 base in one transaction. Its much faster to start with a partial base and then expand it


[17-Jan-22 09:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also much easier to pay off a 4-rig base assuming you got it on loan


[17-Jan-22 09:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
just for example


[17-Jan-22 09:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you are making 18k per day in profit, I think that would make you a "qualified borrower"


[17-Jan-22 09:32 PM] artokun#0000
4-2-2 looks reasonable

efficiently anyways


[17-Jan-22 09:42 PM] artokun#0000

[17-Jan-22 09:45 PM] artokun#0000
i'll start putting funds together then, probably be a week or two before I can move anyways


[17-Jan-22 09:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The core module is ready, possibly 2 days wait on the PSL. by that time I will have about 1/3 of the BFABs needed


[17-Jan-22 09:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
1-2 weeks seems realistic, it wont be rushed


[17-Jan-22 09:46 PM] artokun#0000
but it's nice that I can buy from corp instead of LM or ANT


[17-Jan-22 09:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
speaking of. Here are our internal prices for BFABs produced on Nike:

```
BSE = 600 AIC
BBH = 800 AIC
BDE = 800 AIC
BTA = 500 AIC
```


[17-Jan-22 09:47 PM] artokun#0000
those are fantastic prices


[17-Jan-22 09:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PSL rates are flexible, lately it has been something like 18000 for 12 PSL


[17-Jan-22 09:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we produce vertically and have very high efficiency PP2s on Nike


[17-Jan-22 09:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also it helps us scale up fast!


[17-Jan-22 09:50 PM] artokun#0000
Hopefully with my AL i can help increase that throughput


[18-Jan-22 01:13 AM] kharadan#0000
I was actually thinking to fill my Harmonia base with FRMs and few rigs and have FPs on Deimos. Do you think it makes sense or is it better to have FPs directly on Harmonia?


[18-Jan-22 01:14 AM] artokun#0000
I‚Äôd hate to waste the space on Deimos


[18-Jan-22 01:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
FPs have same building cost and same efficiency on either planet. Since all else is equal, it is best to do the FP on harmonia.


[18-Jan-22 01:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
By running the FP on deimos, supplied by rigs and farms on harmonia, you incur extra shipping cost on everything you make. You also you need to ship rations back to harmonia to keep it running.


[18-Jan-22 01:19 AM] kharadan#0000
I would have to get the final product out of there anyway


[18-Jan-22 01:19 AM] kharadan#0000
but ok, if it's better to have FPs directly there, I'll modify my plan, maybe use one of those suggested above üôÇ


[18-Jan-22 01:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
try to avoid logistics stress between your bases. In the long term the fuel will be very expensive for frequent flights.


[18-Jan-22 01:22 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There are ways to get very cost-effective flights going both directions if each base is efficient and the final products are not overly heavy or somehow requiring a lot of shipping capacity.


[18-Jan-22 01:24 AM] kharadan#0000
thanks


[18-Jan-22 01:52 AM] kharadan#0000
btw if I read it right, there seems to bee a shortage of pioneers on Harmonia, so better not go too much over 200 PIO with initial base, right?


[18-Jan-22 09:46 AM] insensless72#0000
If the jobs are available and the consumables are there PIOs will appear on base on the next pop report. They will be distributed between everyone with open jobs for them

[18-Jan-22 11:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan worst case, you would end up waiting a few weeks to get up to 100% workforce. With open jobs and open beds on planet, pioneers will show up over time to fill the demand


[18-Jan-22 11:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with more advanced workers it is more difficult, you need to do infrastructure projects, etc. Pioneers just kinda show up with their suitcase

Does anybody have C for sale?


[05-Feb-22 01:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
hey @rune_242 we are trying to get some permanent carbon bases established. We had several C producers quit playing, and there is a carbon crunch in the larger markets too.


[05-Feb-22 01:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will try to locate some for you. How much C and on which planet do you want it?


[05-Feb-22 06:47 PM] rune_242#0000
60


[05-Feb-22 06:47 PM] rune_242#0000
On Deimos


[05-Feb-22 10:24 PM] insensless72#0000
Just taking a quick poll. Is there anyone on Harmonia producing an excess of crops? Or is everything being run through FP for consumables?


[06-Feb-22 12:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Harmonia We are looking to accumulate GRN and HCP as a carbon reserve. Also I am testing out these new @planet commands


[06-Feb-22 01:01 AM] allocater#0000
I have been running crop excess and forgot to pick up HCP on the last visit, so atm I have 150 GRN and 50 HCP


[06-Feb-22 03:26 PM] allocater#0000
Alright here is my shopping list for the next 10 days to max out Harmonia farming:
4 HB1
7 FRM
    44 BBH
    8 BDE
    36 BSE
    4 BTA
    1000 MCG


[06-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
44 BBH *800 = 35200 AIC


[06-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
8 BDE *800= 6400 AIC


[06-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
36 BSE *600 = 21600 AIC


[06-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
4 BTA *500 = 2000


[06-Feb-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can supply you at these prices on Nike, Maybe Namthorn or Kharadan can help you out on Deimos if thats more convenient


[06-Feb-22 03:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its about 65k total


[06-Feb-22 03:32 PM] kharadan#0000
I can do the MCG on Deimos
1000 MCG * 15 = 15000 AIC
I could as well help with the bfabs


[06-Feb-22 03:33 PM] kharadan#0000
and btw. how about H2O?
will you be importing it, or should we throw in some rigs as well?


[06-Feb-22 03:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh, my price 65k was not including MCG


[06-Feb-22 03:38 PM] allocater#0000
Quite the undertaking! Nike is fine. I can create bfab buy requests there and MCG requests on Deimos.
H20 extraction is not that good on Harmonia, I import from the exchange.

the max reserve in the wildlife park is 300 of these, and it requires 10 per day.


[05-Mar-22 01:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the most difficult part is FP time, now that I look at it

oh didn't know anybody uses FOD, I can produce that


[05-Mar-22 01:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is only good for the planetary infrastructure building. Collectively we are responsible for Nike infrastructure, but otherwise no player-owned buildings require it.


[05-Mar-22 01:06 PM] allocater#0000
I never produce VEG since it's worse than NUT but I will add it to the rotation

[22-Mar-22 04:30 AM] cazertanu#0000
I ran out of pioneers to hire. I did not know that could happen. Then I checked the planetary infrastructure. It is all empty.


[22-Mar-22 04:43 AM] namthorn#0000
it can happen normally. you only get a % of the reserve pool to draw from as fresh recruits each week.


[22-Mar-22 04:44 AM] cazertanu#0000
Ok. What happens when the reserve pool isbempty?


[22-Mar-22 04:45 AM] namthorn#0000
no one can hire enough pioneers


[22-Mar-22 04:45 AM] namthorn#0000
it happened on deimos last week


[22-Mar-22 04:45 AM] namthorn#0000
gov was a bit too greedy with the EDU 3 programs and all the pioneers on the planet disappeared


[22-Mar-22 04:46 AM] namthorn#0000
well, all the free ones and then some

[22-Mar-22 10:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@rune_242 best to build simple pioneer buildings that work with your existing production


[22-Mar-22 10:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for example, if you are smelting AL on deimos, add EXT, SME, or other related buildings as necessary


[23-Mar-22 04:14 AM] rune_242#0000
But that won't give me more pioneers right?

[29-Mar-22 08:00 PM] cazertanu#0000
what sould i make with the PG?


[29-Mar-22 08:05 PM] cazertanu#0000
PWO or OFF?


[29-Mar-22 08:06 PM] cazertanu#0000
i have 42 COT


[29-Mar-22 08:24 PM] insensless72#0000
PG is required for PWO and 1 of 2 recipes for OVE. If you have 42 COT already definitely go PWO and OVE with it


[29-Mar-22 08:29 PM] cazertanu#0000
i had got the COT from our dearly departed. i need to buy most of that pg because i have no PG production myself


[29-Mar-22 08:30 PM] insensless72#0000
I have some on Nike, see what you can get from DLR when he is free first and ill help supply what he cant


[29-Mar-22 08:30 PM] insensless72#0000

Looking for HCP:MAI:GRN :: 2:1:1


[01-Apr-22 05:07 AM] rune_242#0000
What is the best recipy for C?


[01-Apr-22 05:12 AM] namthorn#0000
depends on the price of HCP/MAI/GRN and how quickly you need the C


[01-Apr-22 05:13 AM] rune_242#0000
If I grow the crops myself and don't need the C quikly?


[01-Apr-22 05:17 AM] namthorn#0000
probably  4 MAI/GRN -> 4 C but it can still vary. Probably best to math it out to be 100% sure that burning the extra crops doesn't yield more bang for your buck than just selling them.


[01-Apr-22 05:23 AM] rune_242#0000
In a month or so il need 26 C a day


[01-Apr-22 05:24 AM] rune_242#0000
Better to build a lot of incinerators or farms?


[01-Apr-22 05:24 AM] rune_242#0000
Incinerators I thinkü§î


[01-Apr-22 05:27 AM] namthorn#0000
or could just buy the C


[01-Apr-22 05:30 AM] namthorn#0000
if you want to make your own C though, incinerators on the same planet as the buildings that will be using the C. Agri packs into a ship easier than C


[01-Apr-22 05:31 AM] rune_242#0000
Thank you for your advice sirüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[01-Apr-22 07:54 AM] cazertanu#0000
I produce more C than I use currently.  I like to charge outsiders $270-300 each but for a clan member I can sell at 245 aic each. @rune_242 . I have 45 carbon for sale today.


[01-Apr-22 07:56 AM] cazertanu#0000
I estimate I can do peak production at 34 Carbon per day, but I will definitely need to charge 270 each for C


[01-Apr-22 08:42 AM] rune_242#0000
Thanks for the offer


[01-Apr-22 08:43 AM] rune_242#0000

[01-Apr-22 09:34 AM] rune_242#0000
Both!


[01-Apr-22 09:34 AM] rune_242#0000
Right now it is just for smelting ore


[01-Apr-22 09:34 AM] cazertanu#0000

if you want to make plastic, come to griffonstone!


[01-Apr-22 09:42 AM] namthorn#0000
killer money to be made there, and a chemistry CoGC to boot for that sweet efficiency gain.

@thummper I can sell it to you at the prices 500 AIC/BTA, 600 AIC/BSE, 800 AIC/BBH, 800 AIC/BDE and 15AIC/MCG. These are the corp rates. So it will be a total of 14 600 AIC. I can bring this all in about 3-4 days to Harmonia and sell it to you on the LM. My ship will come to Harmonia anyway. In exchange I would like to buy 40 C from you on the LM on Harmonia with a discount, 270 AIC/u, for a total of 10 800 AIC. If you don't have the 14 600 AIC cash for the construction mats, I can buy C first, which will give you some cash. I can also accept orders with longer fulfilment (10 days). So this will leave you time for the payment. Do you agree? If you do, I will let you know when my ship is closer to flying to Harmonia.


[01-May-22 09:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
And you don't need to fly your ships for that. I bring the construction mats on Harmonia, and take C.


[01-May-22 09:40 AM] thummper#0000
If that's fine for you, I kinda feel bad for buying at corp rates


[01-May-22 09:40 AM] thummper#0000
its like 34k+ for me to buy mats at cx


[01-May-22 09:40 AM] allocater#0000
@thummper you can also sell 1 C for 100k for a development loan, then you can build up the base faster and make more money faster

@Harmonia Does anyone sell carbon C? I could buy 100 units.


[29-May-22 10:05 AM] thummper#0000
all mine will be on a van to deimos, would be 2 days for 100 on harmonia

Well, it's even better. I can buy it on Deimos.

@Harmonia I would like to buy 400 RAT for the COGC upkeep. Let me know if you have some to sell. Just make provisions for the next upkeep cycles.

Is it common to just have incinerators and purchase the crops?

Off planet yes, on planet you can upgrade your HQ and fuel the INC with more FRM. its important to find a balance

@allocater Do you have more DW? Need it for the upkeep on Phobos. Could buy 2K.

[05-Jun-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
finding enough crops is a challenge. I would be happy to strike an agreement with somebody to grow for me on harmonia


[05-Jun-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
otherwise I will be forced to get my own FRMs, which is not the end of the world

I've switched my production around but I only make like 5 grn/mai/hcp extra otherwise i would sell more

Do you know how much of each you would need to run at 100%?


[05-Jun-22 03:49 PM] thummper#0000
And if you got 100% of would your production increase by more than 55 C?

[05-Jun-22 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
My minimum consumption is 67 GRN per day, if I have no HCP


[05-Jun-22 03:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Max consumption would be pure HCP/GRN recipe. which is 102 HCP and 51 GRN per day


[05-Jun-22 04:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in practice, I focus on keeping GRN/MAI in supply


[05-Jun-22 04:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if I chance upon a pile of HCP, I put it all in a big recipe and let it rip


[05-Jun-22 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@thummper bottom line, I am somewhere between 67 and 100 C per day, depending on how much HCP i can get

well would be possible with lower cof


[05-Jun-22 04:22 PM] thummper#0000
but in general I could retool with more hyf / frm as long as my current production is covered i guess?


[05-Jun-22 04:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
more HYF is good, but i think you will have issues with MHL


[05-Jun-22 04:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[11-Jun-22 10:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Max will be around 450-500 H2O when I fully develop this base. Any more and I would be taking down incinerators.

From experience, make sure you have the RIGS to back them up or a supply chain with another member established


[11-Jun-22 06:04 PM] exeler#0000
Is the cx not typically reliable for water?

I've usually been just buying it in bulk from the cx. I've also only got 2 FRMs so I don't use all that much water yet.


[11-Jun-22 06:06 PM] insensless72#0000
I burn 200 H2O per day so it is to an extent


[11-Jun-22 06:06 PM] insensless72#0000
you can quickly outgrow it


[11-Jun-22 06:08 PM] exeler#0000
How many farms is that? That sounds wild


[11-Jun-22 06:10 PM] insensless72#0000
Currently only 7 FRM and 7 FP


[11-Jun-22 06:11 PM] churavis#0000
Water usage depends on the recipe selected

[11-Jun-22 06:20 PM] exeler#0000
True, I kinda assumed most of them were similar. I've only been running the carbon crop recipes, do the food crops take different amounts of H20 and/or run a lot faster?

I'm also guessing `FP` is where crops are turned into actually usable food and that some of those recipes also involve H20?


[11-Jun-22 06:25 PM] insensless72#0000
it depends on what H2O recipe your run through FP and what recipe for RAT you decide to use through FRM and FP. For example I run the BEA NUT GRN recipe which produces 12 of each, uses 10 H20 total for 1 recipe of RAT. Flip the coin though and if you expand into DW then it becomes way more costly. I use the 10x recipe without PG so thats 100 H20 every 1 day for 70 DW x2 at 200 H20 every day for 140 DW + FRM demand


[11-Jun-22 06:26 PM] insensless72#0000

This is sensible, and has happened at various points in the distant past. Whenever that occurs, I let them fight it out on the HCP


[14-Jun-22 07:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but now it looks like a GRN and MAI shortage, which is uglier.


[14-Jun-22 07:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I recognize that my 14 INC are part of the problem here, but that only kicks the can down the road, because several of us depend on my PG and C.


[14-Jun-22 07:06 PM] churavis#0000
It's affected water supplies too, I saw an LM ad for 40/u briefly on Harmonia


[14-Jun-22 07:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I could scale down INC, and scale up RIG... Or scale down both and get my own FRMs, thus removing myself from the nasty market situation.

I'm new and have a mostly empty base on Harmonia and have plans to build up a bunch of FRM and INC. I don't make enough crops to bite on the orders, but I did some quick napkin math on them and it looks like it made more sense for me to just burn the crops than to take those orders. Even with the super expensive but fast recipe.

I could be wrong but im pretty sure its just a natural side effect of having unemployment and 0 open jobs. PIO are the easiest to get back so its not a huge concern


[29-Jun-22 02:18 PM] allocater#0000
the table says +2091, the graph says -2000? The only number not listed in the table is bases, so does that mean 40 bases got destroyed and their PIO with them?

[29-Jun-22 06:11 PM] namthorn#0000
I think you're correct @allocater. That's the only way for this not to be a bug, so some number of companies got removed which took 4k workers with them. I assume the process of account deletion/coliq completely removes all workers from the planet you were using, compared to demolishing a base, which should just add those workers back into the pool I think?


[29-Jun-22 06:12 PM] namthorn#0000
and we already know that base creation magics 200 pioneers into being which do not appear on popr migration.


[29-Jun-22 06:12 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, I wouldn't think that COLIQ or deletion would decrease the unemployment so much


[29-Jun-22 06:14 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, unemployment was roughly 4k workers. you dont just lose them due to migration because they're unemployed if their happiness needs are filled.

[05-Aug-22 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
If not then I‚Äôll probably just run DW/RAT


[05-Aug-22 08:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think Archiel has RAT set up on Harmonia, and some non-corp guy Viggie (sp?) tries his hardest to get people to buy his DW. It sounds like the corp needs more C on Deimos, and that's the angle that I am taking. Personally, I think we need someone on Harmonia to run some HYP and get us our daily dose of COF. As a ferocious coffee drinker in real life, I can appreciate the struggle that my pioneers must have, working without it.
HYP would align with the COGC Agriculture, and the CX is desperate to buy it. It would be a real money maker.


[05-Aug-22 08:45 AM] churavis#0000
If you read the strategy channel, you'll know that we're planning on setting up a dedicated INC planet as well as a dedicated FP planet nearby so that we can go full FRM on Harmonia and Demeter. That's pretty exciting to me.

I would like to make two more FRMs on Harmonia and another Pioneer HB1:
12x BBH ,  2x BDE , 10x BSE , (0 BTA and 0 MCG already have these)
Would you send a contract on Harmonia, please? These will help me keep my agricultural inputs supplied.

Alot of people run C here, and I‚Äôm thinking of starting some INCs myself, so, what kind of recipes/layouts do you run? Optimal/recipe setup for a 500 area base?


[02-Sep-22 07:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
big debate.  I come down on the side of being fully vertically integrated for C and running the GRN only recipe because sourcing crops is a major pain.  The truly optimal C base would run the fast recipe, but you have to source some or all of those crops


[02-Sep-22 07:39 PM] churavis#0000
Without sourcing crops, optimizing for area dictates more INC burning the slow recipe


[02-Sep-22 07:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
FRMs are extremely large, so it's hard to fit enough of them in a base to meet the needs of the fast recipe; you actually get more C and money just running GRN if you grow things yourself


[02-Sep-22 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Lets say you made crops yourself, and bought water to save space, then what do we do?


[02-Sep-22 08:06 PM] exeler#0000
I currently run 10 FRM, 6 INC 2 RIG on Harmonia with the fast recipe. I recently swapped from growing a balance of crops and buying the occasional GRN/MAI to just growing HCP 24/7 and grabbing all my GRN/MAI from the CX


[02-Sep-22 08:07 PM] exeler#0000
This nets me ~80 C per day which is more than enough to fully stock my 20 SME base on Deimos so I still have enough C to sell


[02-Sep-22 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats a nice way to do it, but it seems it would need a full time ship‚Ä¶no can do here‚Ä¶


[02-Sep-22 08:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Carbon is heaver than the crops used to make it, so it seems like it'd be easier to start INCs on the SME planet if you want to minimize shipping. Since populated fertile planets aren't super common it seems, I'd be inclined to max FRM on the good planets (demeter and harmonia).


[02-Sep-22 08:42 PM] churavis#0000
That depends on the recipe used and the ship involved


[02-Sep-22 08:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
even the 8 crops -> 4 C fast burn is a little heavier. Although good point about the WCB ships.


[02-Sep-22 09:06 PM] exeler#0000
I get about 3 days before I need to pick up the C if I don't sell any on the LM.


[02-Sep-22 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean like bringing in hundreds of GRN/MAI


[02-Sep-22 09:18 PM] exeler#0000
That's negligible compared to getting the C off planet. I've got ~300 of each on planet so I won't need to ship any in for a while, but I'll be shipping C off much more frequently. Plus I'm not the only farmer on Harmonia, I can usually get crops from the LM if I set the price high enough (200/u seems like a sweet spot and still turns a profit when burned for C)

@Deleted User With a BASIC sub, it is tricky to grow the fast recipe. The numbers for carbon inputs don't line up, so I found that I am juggling the order queue depending on my inventory. 10 FRM seems sufficient for 4 INC doing the fast recipe, but it has required me to watch things closely.

can you explain how this works?


[03-Sep-22 06:40 AM] rune_242#0000
what is the difference between the green and red?


[03-Sep-22 07:42 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Green is movement to the ask and red is movement to the bid. If you see green, that means the price for buys increased, red means it decreased. Oftentimes you‚Äôll see just a green line, not column and that is a specific buy at the ask; a red line would be a specific sell at the bid


[03-Sep-22 04:48 PM] seraphx2#0000
So what does OVE and RAT production look like here? if I post on LM is it likely to get fulfilled or are those scarce?

Generally people are selling RATs to fellow corp mates at 50/u. I think they get filled pretty quickly on Harmonia. I've got about 250 RAT to spare right now.


[03-Sep-22 04:50 PM] archielvahr#0000

[03-Sep-22 04:51 PM] churavis#0000
We're trying to build out YK-649b as a Food Processing planet so hopefully in a few weeks we'll have plenty of RAT and DW


[03-Sep-22 04:54 PM] seraphx2#0000
ok. cool. i'll just rely on CX for the time being. don't need any RAT or OVE for 2 weeks at the moment anyway.


[03-Sep-22 04:54 PM] churavis#0000
I've got plenty of OVE in stock on Harmonia


[03-Sep-22 05:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
What‚Äôs your usage like? Pretty easy to cover one or two bases, but if it‚Äôs like 6, you‚Äôll probably need to supplement at the CX. Hoping our new members and new planets start helping with that!


[03-Sep-22 05:04 PM] seraphx2#0000
my ultimate plan is to become self-sufficient on DW and RAT (I already am on DW) and then i can just spend that money on OVE and luxury


[03-Sep-22 05:08 PM] seraphx2#0000
right now im at 25.6 and 3.2 per day. with my current buildout plan for C to get myself self-sufficient the way i want I expect to be at 39.2 and 4.9. but then from there, i plan to build out RAT production which then I'll just be needing OVE and luxury


[03-Sep-22 05:09 PM] seraphx2#0000
but that's just my first iterations. from there i'll still have more bas space on Harmonia


[03-Sep-22 05:09 PM] seraphx2#0000
but that's as far as i've planned so far


[03-Sep-22 05:09 PM] churavis#0000
You may want to consider just building out your agricultural production and then getting a loan to build an FP base on YK-649b so you can stack experts and synergize with each planet's COGC


[03-Sep-22 05:12 PM] seraphx2#0000
hmm. that's not a bad flight at all


[03-Sep-22 05:21 PM] seraphx2#0000
so, at least 100% efficiency is max 6.4 H2O per day per RIG.
that seems slow.
is the expectation (just from a planning perspective) that I would want to move excess water from Harmonia?

Basically allocater sends you a contract to buy crops or something and gives it a 20 or 30 day tail to fulfill while he pays your right away

It requires a lot of trust so usually on within corporations where the cost of reneging on your obligations is much higher as the loss of access to corp resources and help far outweighs the value of any loan


[03-Sep-22 06:31 PM] seraphx2#0000

[03-Sep-22 06:40 PM] seraphx2#0000
i think im actually interested in running DW and RAT production. It's something everyone needs to keep all the production lines going.
would definitely be cool to help distribute that.

what about branching out into COF?


[03-Sep-22 07:05 PM] seraphx2#0000
i know it's not FP structures only, but, it would be one less thing to source externally and that can be built off of H2O production


[03-Sep-22 07:05 PM] insensless72#0000
More COF would be welcome, along with any tier consumable


[03-Sep-22 07:06 PM] insensless72#0000
as you stated earlier, we all need it üòÑ


[03-Sep-22 07:07 PM] seraphx2#0000
because honestly, DW, RAT and COF is something i've been thinking of trying to do for self-sufficiency, but it would be cool to like, try to build out something that hadnles those 3 things and ships to main planets to lessen the burden on logistics for even getting them, not just reducing costs


[03-Sep-22 07:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Consumables is definitely something youd find a niche for here. make sure to check the corp sheet so youre competitive in pricing internally

[08-Sep-22 02:44 PM] allocater#0000
how you like, custom contracts are still new and we are still used to setting up buys on the LM, LM is also easier for sporadic deals, while custom contracts are good for repeat deals.


[08-Sep-22 03:06 PM] exeler#0000
I use the LM for when I don't know exactly who can/will fill the order, and I use custom contracts for when someone specific is selling/buying something (and doesn't already have a LM order posted)


[08-Sep-22 03:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I wouldn't put good sell deals on the LM, unless no one has a need for them, since they'll just get sniped by randoms.  We typically just offer what we have on here and then people will send you a custom contract.  If you need something, you can put up an LM buy order at the corp price and let folks know here that it's up and they'll fill at their convenience

for 400 the LM will probably take it, in corp the expectation is more like 350 atm I think


[13-Sep-22 11:28 AM] seraphx2#0000

[13-Sep-22 11:28 AM] seraphx2#0000

[13-Sep-22 11:30 AM] allocater#0000
roughly yes, but it's just everyone's discounts offers


[13-Sep-22 11:33 AM] seraphx2#0000
so the only noted one on there for C is 270. so since I don't get outside of Harmonia much, should I be investigating other LMs on my own to figure that out? lol
Like where did you get 350 from?


[13-Sep-22 11:37 AM] allocater#0000
in the last month, I noticed most C changing hands for 350, I think. Usually we just put offers or announce it, and if nobody takes it, we sell on CX.


[13-Sep-22 11:39 AM] seraphx2#0000
ahh i see


[13-Sep-22 11:40 AM] seraphx2#0000
i was just hoping to be like a dedicated provider. known income for me, they get known inputs.  haha
like, i can put C up for 400 on LM but then no one in the corp can count on that....and even if i tried to do 350, that would probably get gobbled up even faster.


[13-Sep-22 11:40 AM] seraphx2#0000
so was hoping to make sure people knew they had a supply if we reached an agreement of like x amount per day


[13-Sep-22 11:41 AM] allocater#0000
that makes sense, there should be plenty of smelters on deimos to require constant C supply


[13-Sep-22 11:41 AM] allocater#0000
I only need 20 per day on deimos, but are currently stocked up


[13-Sep-22 11:45 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You will almost certainly find constant in corp buyers for 350. There is a ton of demand. Particularly if you ship to Nike

Any thoughts on a 19 INC 9 HYF base on Harmonia? For 29 `NS` and 360 `H2O` input a day, it can churn out ~140 C per day with a small surplus of both HCP and MAI.

Break even per C seems to be around `220` according to PRUNer


[16-Sep-22 02:29 AM] allocater#0000
are your ready to specialize? then Harmonia can be pure HYF and NAscent pure INC. What will be your water source?


[16-Sep-22 02:51 AM] exeler#0000
If we do a pure HYF base, probably want to put that on a stronger H2O planet? 

I was also toying around with a design for a CAF base on Etherwind. Could potentially put the HYF there? Or ship the water in from there to Harmonia? 

Or really, any planet will do for HYF because they're not subject to fertility. HYF solves the problem of not having enough FRM bases to feed the INC since they take up half the area that a FRM does and produce more crops faster. In terms of area used, HYF is over twice as effective as FRM if you have a solid water source.  

They aren't able to produce everything for the fastest recipe though, so we could do a mix of FRM and HYF to get max throughout of each INC. I think it'll always be easier to build more INC and run the middle tier recipes than it will be to source enough crops to keep them running fast. 

Harmonia probably isn't the best spot for a HYF focused base, I was just toying with PRUNer and realized packing the HYF instead of FRM on my base there would actually let me nearly double the amount of C I can make there.


[16-Sep-22 03:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
Ice Station is a good water-producing station, and it is very close to us. Etherwind needs more capacity.


[16-Sep-22 03:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think the cost of hydroponics is quite high, both in terms of investment and transportation capacity, and the market is easily saturated. Hydroponics is suitable for us to produce some advanced consumables according to internal demand.

[05-Oct-22 11:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now the water capacity is very tight, you'd better build your own rig for a while, HCP saves water.

If you have room for extra H2O production on Etherwind, I also have similar problems to solve for my future  Harmonia base plans and would love to be able to buy a rather large quantity of H2O on Harmonia regularly.


[06-Oct-22 07:36 PM] dehzhas#0000
That is an evolving situation. I can actually use more water than I can produce depending on what I am making at the time. But once I get up and running I can see where the balance falls. I will be making regular trips from Etherwind to Harmonia so I can grab shipments from others for water in my delivery.


[06-Oct-22 07:36 PM] dehzhas#0000
I know there are a few players on Etherwind now that are getting water production up.


[06-Oct-22 07:37 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have a 2k/2k ship that will run that route regularly so I can take a lot of water to Harmonia


[06-Oct-22 07:41 PM] exeler#0000
That'd be cool. I could even buy water from various people on Etherwind and then just issue shipping contracts to fill ships that would be flying to Harmonia with empty space. 

I'm still drafting plants, and have an Etherwind base in mind to produce the water I need, but if someone's selling and I can skip a step that's even better.


[06-Oct-22 07:43 PM] dehzhas#0000
@zipatsu has a metric ton of it coming out now. You can buy from him and I can ship at least once a week, maybe twice


[06-Oct-22 07:47 PM] exeler#0000
Good to know. My Harmonia base is self sufficient on H2O right now, but I had some plans to rework it to dramatically increase C output at the cost of needing to ship in loads of H2O


[06-Oct-22 07:49 PM] exeler#0000
I'm currently in a phase of stashing inputs in my bases then I'll be saving for my next project. 

So I'll probably be getting my next shopping list together sometime next week. If I can source H2O then I'll probably be shopping for a bunch of mats to build INC and HYF, otherwise it'll be RIGs on Etherwind.


[06-Oct-22 07:50 PM] dehzhas#0000

Any chance you'd be willing to accept a longer payment period for the MHL? I'll have to do some math, but it shouldn't be too long. I can break the order up into chunks to pay for them incrementally instead of waiting for all of it at once if you want.

That's by far the largest cost for this plan, but if I can get it started sooner rather than later that would be awesome.

[11-Oct-22 12:53 AM] dehzhas#0000
I will have extra capacity for about 4k H2O combing back from Etherwind roughly every 4 days. I am probably going to be using 100% of my own supply, but Zipatsu can probably sell it to you and I can ship it.


[11-Oct-22 12:54 AM] dehzhas#0000
So 4k H2O from Zipatsu will cover most, but not all of it.


[11-Oct-22 12:55 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
I can cover the rest for you then Terra


[11-Oct-22 01:00 AM] dehzhas#0000
If I can close the deal with Zipatsu directly, I can purchase it from him and you can purchase it from me + shipping cost so we don't have to manage a bunch of shipping contracts. I can just deliver you a bunch of water.


[11-Oct-22 01:05 AM] dehzhas#0000
Oh... I did math wrong. I can cover the whole thing in one shipment 4k > 2.08k  üò≥


[11-Oct-22 01:07 AM] exeler#0000
Y'all are legends. This is gonna be dope once it is set up.


[11-Oct-22 01:07 AM] dehzhas#0000
When do you want me to start deliveries?


[11-Oct-22 01:10 AM] exeler#0000
Probably soon. I should be able to build the HYF this week once my ads on Nike get filled and I have time to ship it all.


[11-Oct-22 01:12 AM] dehzhas#0000
Ok, let me know. I can provide weekly deliveries of 3640 H2O from Etherwind for a flat 80k including shipping, assuming Zipatsu goes for it.

[12-Oct-22 03:42 PM] churavis#0000
Two NS ads up if anyone can help out


[12-Oct-22 05:00 PM] exeler#0000
I'll check my NS stockpile tonight if nobody who produces it has any on hand. I ended up buying quite a bit of NS across different sources, so I can probably spare a bit of my stockpile.


[12-Oct-22 05:03 PM] churavis#0000
I can match whatever you spent on the market


[12-Oct-22 05:05 PM] exeler#0000
I honestly forgot what I spent on it already.

Nah, that would be too mainstream.

Do you have 80k now for a weeks supply?


[13-Oct-22 11:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you are going to engage in hydroponics in Harmonia, it is more convenient to transport water from the ice station.


[13-Oct-22 11:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
My TNP has started to operate. If anyone needs HSE to build a base in the ice station, they can make an appointment in advance.


[13-Oct-22 11:18 PM] dehzhas#0000
I already have a boat going to Etherwind regularly, so transporting the H2O for Exeler is convenient.


[13-Oct-22 11:19 PM] dehzhas#0000
I may take you up on that at some point. I have a Ice Station Alpha base planned.


[13-Oct-22 11:26 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, I actually would really like this.


[13-Oct-22 11:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
Contract sent. My ship arrives at Etherwind in 11h. I will turn right around and come back with the H2O.

Is the contract for purchasing crops that you put in LM for external newcomers?


[14-Oct-22 11:42 AM] exeler#0000
For mine, not intentionally. I'm just buying crops.

My base here can operate in "slow mode" with just burning HCP and MAI that it produces, but if I buy or import GRN I can run the fast recipe for even more C. 

Basically, if I can buy the GRN on the LM reliably, I'm going to keep doing that indefinitely.


[15-Oct-22 01:40 AM] allocater#0000
Can I also sign up as H2O customer on harmonia?


[15-Oct-22 02:35 AM] domicius#0000
I can do that for you. I am on a fast burn but just one INC. I can build some more FRM in order to get you that GRN. Just tell me how much you are planning to need.


[15-Oct-22 02:44 AM] exeler#0000
I'm on 12 INC right now. iirc, PRUNer said roughly 100 GRN per day. 

I'll double check tomorrow though


[15-Oct-22 02:44 AM] exeler#0000
I can swap for HCP and MAI as well since I produce an excess of those.


[15-Oct-22 02:45 AM] domicius#0000
Hmm. I'll need to scale up a bit


[15-Oct-22 02:45 AM] domicius#0000
I do HCP MAI GRN


[15-Oct-22 02:45 AM] domicius#0000
Let me know your needs and I'll build it


[15-Oct-22 02:48 AM] exeler#0000
It's just the GRN. I burn the fast recipe for all 12 INC. I have 13 HYF that produce an excess of HCP and MAI, but HYF can't make GRN. 

 I make a fair amount of extra HCP and MAI that I can't burn in my INC. So if you have FRM making HCP and MAI, I can sell those cheap so you can swap them to do more GRN.


[15-Oct-22 02:51 AM] domicius#0000
OK. Sounds like a plan. I'll scope it out later today.


[15-Oct-22 03:44 AM] paxmagellanic#0000

[15-Oct-22 03:46 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
How much do you think you'd need? I was looking at making 2.5k a day on Etherwind to ship to Harmonia.


[15-Oct-22 03:49 AM] allocater#0000
I could consume 200-300 water per day


[15-Oct-22 03:50 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
Oh that's easy


[15-Oct-22 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm buying up to 400 C, feel free to send ads for smaller amounts at your normal price


[15-Oct-22 12:15 PM] dehzhas#0000
I can bring in around 30k H2O a week from Etherwind to Harmonia. Currently around 22k are spoken for. I buy from Etherwind for 20 and sell for about 22 on Harmonia to cover shipping costs. If anyone wants part of that regular shipping capacity, let me know.


[15-Oct-22 12:16 PM] dehzhas#0000

[15-Oct-22 02:04 PM] exeler#0000
Dang...

I mean it makes sense since the first few super slow weeks of the game are a big turn off for most players who might enjoy the pace of the game later on. 

So prioritizing a feature that will allow them to retain more new players makes more sense than a QOL feature that really only the vets would make use of. And I don't think people are quitting in large numbers because of a lack of recurring contracts.


[15-Oct-22 02:04 PM] dehzhas#0000
We got into this on the next (not yet released) Pear Talks PrUn podcast and we weren't a fan generally.


[15-Oct-22 02:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
I would definitely prioritize better introduction to the game and better late game over recurring contracts, as nice as they would be for me personally, but I don't think the missions will do that.


[15-Oct-22 02:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
At least as they look right now.


[15-Oct-22 02:09 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, that's a separate concern lol. 

If the missions don't actually make the new player experience better then I don't see a reason for them.

Buying 100 NS @ 160 `LMA ZV-896b/7824`


[22-Oct-22 11:47 PM] optitronic#0000
Any advice for getting started on Harmonia? Right now I have the basic Carbon farmer base setup making carbon and some other farming goods to sell. I think I'm ready to start expanding though.


[22-Oct-22 11:51 PM] churavis#0000

Do you want to setup a regular subscription for consumables? I offer regularly scheduled supply, delivery included of tier 1 and 2 consumables for a pre-purchase agreement.


[24-Oct-22 08:25 PM] jackinabox86#0000
You're doing more than DW and RAT these days?


[24-Oct-22 08:33 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yep, basically all tier 1 and 2 consumables at discounts below market rates, except COF isn't discounted yet because I don't make it yet. It's basically market rate and I absorb variability and deliver with the other consumables.


[24-Oct-22 08:34 PM] dehzhas#0000
Basically, you tell me your population distribution and I deliver to the planet weekly the exact amount you need.


[24-Oct-22 08:34 PM] dehzhas#0000
Any of Nike, Heph, Harmonia, Phobos, Deimos


[24-Oct-22 08:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
do you have like an intake form?  I'll almost certainly do it for all of them


[24-Oct-22 08:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think you should charge above market rates.  The price should reflect convenience.  But I've already rambled about that, so i will accept nice pricing


[24-Oct-22 08:38 PM] dehzhas#0000
I will consider that out of corp, but inside the corp I feel I'm contributing to the greater good and get nice benefits from everyone else in return üôÇ

If no one else has any, I produce a lot on Nike. My supply is low at the moment, but I produce it quickly.

Thank you. I'll need to buy more soon, but I need to source some money first as I just used all my capital to expand a new base as early as I could üòÖ

[14-Nov-22 08:30 AM] churavis#0000
You could donate to upkeep to help technician happiness but the biggest reason for the technician unhappiness is high unemployment so just having open jobs should bring more in.

[14-Nov-22 09:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, Harmonia is odd with their very high population and very low count of technicians and above. With 10 technicians on the planet... that's probably a single orchard on the whole planet. üòõ


[14-Nov-22 09:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
The need deficit is really high. If we were actually trying to satisfy needs, it looks like we'd need 6 SST and 7 INF. Better to just accept the emigration and lean on open jobs  to boost the tech population, like Churv said


[14-Nov-22 09:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
as I've been doing more population modeling, I'm getting the impression that festivities might be cheaper than actually providing upkeep items. I don't know the cost on Harmonia for the festivities, however


[14-Nov-22 10:07 AM] churavis#0000
You can't overcome unemployment with upkeep, if there's no jobs there there won't be many workers. What good is Healthcare if you don't have a job to pay for it?


[14-Nov-22 10:42 AM] erklein#0000
Festivities is 20/40/80 k. Does it scale with population?


[14-Nov-22 10:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
On QJ-650c, pretty sure Festivities III was like 16k. I can't look right now cause it's running though.


[14-Nov-22 11:00 AM] balbar#0000
On Se-648b its 5.5k/11k/22k for the festivities, so yeah, it scales

[18-Nov-22 02:29 AM] exeler#0000
There's no rush on these orders, I have enough stock to last 15d, and this would bring it over 30 if delivered all at once. I just realized it's a lot easier to coordinate if I just throw up the LM ads and anyone who's shipping water can easily pick up any orders they feel like filling

STO is a necessity for any base and two for any base with an extra permit or two


[05-Dec-22 06:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
My base is scattered in ANT, BEN and HRT, so if I can, I like to store consumables and raw materials for nearly a month to reduce my supply frequency. It's easier for me to play like this.

[05-Dec-22 06:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
The more population types, product types, and the number of planets are scattered, the more complicated the supply will be. If I don't extend the supply cycle, I will be dragged down by this matter. However, this also leads to a very high inventory value and a low turnover rate.


[05-Dec-22 06:56 PM] exeler#0000
That's basically how I play too, I try to stock up on a large amount of the inputs for every base so they don't require as much babysitting. I still only have my baby starter ships though, so the heavier or larger goods are more difficult to ship in large quantities like that.

[19-Dec-22 03:45 PM] dehzhas#0000
I can do regular H2O deliveries to Harmonia for 22/u from Etherwind. I am pretty close to max capacity on my ships so it would need to be in bulk for 1 delivery a week planned in advance.

[05-Jan-23 09:10 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
At full capacity I'll produce 12 every 10hr53m. (Using the H2O-nly recipe, as I lack whatever the better recipe's 2nd component is)


[05-Jan-23 09:12 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Nutrient Solution I think?


[05-Jan-23 09:26 PM] dehzhas#0000
I might be able to provide some NS here or there as well. How much would you need for your rate of production?


[06-Jan-23 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have a couple hundred extra NS on Harmonia, 160/u if you want some


[06-Jan-23 12:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Let's see... 4 NS + 2 H2O = 2 RCO every 7h 16m... Roughly 7 RCO per day x 12 FRM = 84 RCO/d.... (2RCOx3 = 21hr 47m & x4 = 29hr 4m aka 1d 6hr 4m... Plus I should be getting my 4th expert soon, as I just got exp4 on Heph...) So upper average would be 16 NS=8 RCO/d x 12FRM = 192 NS daily input / 96 RCO daily output.


[06-Jan-23 12:05 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Let's say 200 NS/d @160 is 32k in input expenses to raise output from an average of 40-45 to 90-95 RCO a day.


[06-Jan-23 12:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Extrapolating input.expenses high and output/earnings low, CX RCO averages @600/u... 600x40 = 24k daily income without NS, and 48k with. As I provide my own H2O via rigs, I'd be spending 32k to make 48k, rather than >0 to make 24k, for a net loss.


[06-Jan-23 12:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
(I suck at math and calculate very conservatively (high loss, low margin) so I may have gotten this super wrong, but from my understanding, its not really worth the effort :/ )


[06-Jan-23 12:11 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh wait


[06-Jan-23 12:12 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
The 1 RCO cheap recipe is nearly 11hrs with 3exp.... So I only make around 24-30 RCO/d in reality, earning 15-18k.


[06-Jan-23 12:14 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Without considering the workforce supply expense, it seems less profitable at a glance. Though if I bothered to math out how much I actually spend on maintenance, my margin is probably shit.


[06-Jan-23 12:28 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
FIO says my 12FRM/4RIG process an average of 26 RCO/d and use -4 COF/d@350=1.4k; -30 RAT&DW/d@60=3.6k; -53 H2O/d (+112/d via RIG); -4 OVE/d; -2 PWO/d@130=260; for a current average of 26 RCO/d.

So... 15.6k gross output  vs 5.5k input expense = about 10k profit (without factoring shipping, fuel, storage, etc.)
Compared to 5.5k+32k= 37.5k input expense with NS, for around 40-45k income....


[06-Jan-23 12:28 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, no. I'd still make around 10k a day, assuming corp prices on inputs, while significantly increasing my overhead.


[06-Jan-23 12:28 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Damn.


[06-Jan-23 12:29 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might even lose money o.O


[06-Jan-23 12:29 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Are FRMs just really shit at RCO production or something?


[06-Jan-23 12:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh, that must be it then. Base HYF can do 4NS+10H2O=2RCO every 5hr 17m, instead of 4NS+2H2O=2RCO every 9hr 36m.


[06-Jan-23 12:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Margin is just... low.


[06-Jan-23 12:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Selling RAT inputs for 100-150/u would net me 12x12= 144u/d x @100/@150 = 14.4k/21.6k income for just the 5.5k base input expense. On the lower end, same as RCO, though going to @150+/u, the profit margin gets a lot better.


[06-Jan-23 12:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
payback period according to Prunner on the NS RCO recipe is 7 days.  That's not bad


[06-Jan-23 12:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
better than all the rat inputs


[06-Jan-23 12:45 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is it though? It doesn't seem like it should be. Should definitely earn more selling RAT inputs unless I'm utterly derping the math


[06-Jan-23 12:45 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[06-Jan-23 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000

[06-Jan-23 12:50 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I've still a ways to go for max experts.


[06-Jan-23 12:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
So most RCO is going to go through the WEPL to become COT. In situations like that, sometimes more of the "value add" ends up on one step or the other. It looks pretty split on RCO vs COT....


[06-Jan-23 12:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've just never found RCO to be super compelling, but I have a FRM -> RAT -> FIM/MEA chain all set up already.


[06-Jan-23 12:54 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, definitely feels like selling RCO wouldn't be a profitable venture unless you're using it to feed higher industry.


[06-Jan-23 12:54 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Or maybe I'm just spoiled by how stupidly profitable making AL on Deimos has been lately.


[06-Jan-23 01:00 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
According to your raw PRUNner data, a self-sufficient 1-perm 12FRM/4RIG base like mine, with COG and max experts, should produce 8 RCO every 24hr40m which coincides with my earlier projections of using 16 NS/d, which at @160 for 12 FRMs is still around 31k per day, to make 8RCO/FRMx12=96 RCO, which currently sells at 600/u, so 57.6k gross income against 31k+5.5k= 36.5k expenses if everything is bought at corp price.


[06-Jan-23 01:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Does look a bit nicer at max exp... Closer to 20k net profit


[06-Jan-23 01:02 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its pretty wild how big a difference a few experts make.

[06-Jan-23 10:14 PM] exeler#0000
FRM in general don't look very good from a profit/day perspective. But they are very low input cost to produce goods. They'll multiple your input costs many times over, but they're just slow and take up a lot of area so you can't build a lot of them on a base. This double sucks because they're the only thing in the game you can't build anywhere you want.


[07-Jan-23 06:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

@mrtcsmithIf you hate the high-priced RAT, you can ask your WCB to go to HRT to transport 10k RAT back, which will last you a long time.

I want to build a new chemical base, and I need a lot of C.


[24-Jan-23 07:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
I believe that almost no one can sell me 1k C at one time, so 100 is an appropriate quantity, especially considering that the scale of C producers in harmonia is usually small.


[24-Jan-23 07:13 AM] habix3956#0000
I think @paxmagellanic can. If I remember correctly he is increasing production to 1.6k C / 5 days


[24-Jan-23 07:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
If he has enough stock, I can buy 2k at one time.

[28-Jan-23 01:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can solve the transportation problem of etherwind, kw-602c, proxion, nemesis,umbra and katoa with only one LCB. These bases can produce H2O, RAT, DW, FIM, C, PG, PE, EPO, OVE, PWO and so on. Then just ship them back to ant regularly.


[28-Jan-23 01:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think this is a good and flexible closed-loop production line. In this way, my ANT base can do something more complicated and needs coordination.

if we're making a move on it again, I will gladly vote the party line üòÑ


[26-Jun-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
but there's been no issues with it, and there's a bit less profit incentive to grab as many planets as possible since we don't get dividends anymore


[26-Jun-24 11:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, if someone wants it then fine to vote anyway, otherwise I'll ensure he gets it, then if he's safe then switch my vote based on the voting order in our parliments tab.


[26-Jun-24 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Harmonia is super easy to run cause it's almost entirely Settlers.


[26-Jun-24 12:09 PM] katinga#0000
does OOG have any interest in Etherwind?  here's how that race is shaping up

[23-Dec-24 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have a base on Harmonia any more so i can't see the COM for the planet. But if you are aiming for a PM seat (which is a good way to start, especially on a big and potentially contested planet) it can be good to say something in the planet chat that you're looking for a PM seat


[23-Dec-24 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000

[23-Dec-24 06:12 PM] roche3950#0000
Also, I want it to be said that I am up for the challenge


[23-Dec-24 08:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Harmonia is generally pretty easy to run. A lot of the upkeep for PIOs is baked in, then keeping a steady safety and health is really all you need.


[23-Dec-24 08:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
When someone notices the vote totals they will start saying something in Harmonia COM though, so keep an eye on it


[25-Dec-24 09:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
If we can get a few votes swapped to LiliDragon, we can bump out xepiov

Do we also want a third person running so we can take full control of the planet?


[25-Dec-24 09:31 PM] roche3950#0000
(what we really need there is the Governor seat too...)


[25-Dec-24 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think two seats would be effective control, realistically. Although rise and cask will probably organize together. But effectively the governor is the one who has to do the work of filling everything


[25-Dec-24 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
And nothing is really wrong with Harmonia so "control" probably wouldn't mean doing anything different


[25-Dec-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the best way to approach it is just to say that as new members you are looking to learn the planet and to participate as beneficial.

[25-Dec-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Practically that probably means having a bit on hand to fill COGC if it gets forgotten


[25-Dec-24 09:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you want more of a takeover situation I guess I'd either wait for Harmonia to be up for grabs and/or look to a planet that has issues or is just small or ignored.


[26-Dec-24 04:06 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I probably wouldn‚Äôt start out on Harmonia. I‚Äôd find a smaller planet that‚Äôs lacking coverage.
