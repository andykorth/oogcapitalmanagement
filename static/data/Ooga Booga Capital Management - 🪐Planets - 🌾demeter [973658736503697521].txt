Ill be back later, i have to work now.


[10-May-22 02:06 PM] namthorn#0000
awesome, i shall stockpile all the bfabs I can (though my production is rather paltry). If anyone needs any GL/PG for fabs for this, gimme a shout


[10-May-22 02:10 PM] allocater#0000
yeah I will need constant GL on nike for BTA


[10-May-22 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
can somebody copy+paste the project cost for LM, WAR and COGC?


[10-May-22 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so we can pin them on this channel

can I give you 96 more?

so you can make more SP


[10-May-22 02:22 PM] rune_242#0000
I'l need them in the future for hq upgrades


[10-May-22 02:41 PM] allocater#0000
so many? ok ad is up


[10-May-22 02:41 PM] rune_242#0000
I need those permits!üòÖ


[14-May-22 02:49 AM] allocater#0000
I think it would be neat if we could maintain large reservoirs of essentials on the planet, so that everyone can easily request it on KIOOG LM.

SF reservoir
FF reservoir
MCG reservoir
B-fab reservoir
COF reservoir
OVE/PWO reservoir (or PG reservoir to make it locally)
... what else?

question is how do we ship the stuff there:
1) public shipping contracts
2) every reservoir manager with their own ship
3) bundles for a dedicated corp shipper (possibly even with 2k/2k new ship)

what do you think?


[14-May-22 04:34 AM] namthorn#0000
probably internal shipping. i doubt many people will take public shipping contracts out there without a hefty pricetag


[14-May-22 09:19 AM] insensless72#0000
We could make a 2000m^3, 2000t ship. It would be perfect for this planet. While the 3000 is perfect for hauling metals. Then regular trips out here and to Harmonia


[14-May-22 09:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
2k/2k ship is ideal. I will start the bfab reservoir tomorrow when i have a little more time


[14-May-22 09:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ima nuke the supply on ANT, just so you guys are aware. Dont panic when all the bfabs vanish. they will build your bases anyways

BDEs are a bit of a pain, ill try to figure out some more of these


[14-May-22 09:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe we can bring them in from moria/benten


[15-May-22 02:36 AM] allocater#0000
I am bringing 100 BDE from hubur I snatched at 1000/u, I also produce 15/day but yeah we could use more PP1

[15-May-22 04:57 AM] allocater#0000
so there will be some excess crop for INCs and I can supply other bases with DW/RAT as usual


[15-May-22 04:57 AM] allocater#0000
but I need input from the RIG base and the supply reservoirs


[15-May-22 05:08 AM] namthorn#0000
weird that people noticed that but not Mad flipping all the AL/FLX a couple days ago


[15-May-22 07:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BSE are probably more watched on the market in general


[15-May-22 07:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
not everyone works with AL, but everyone buys bfabs


[18-May-22 01:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@rune_242 we are going to need about 80-100 TRU for this initial build


[18-May-22 01:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also @spatial_piano , @domicius we will need about 6k-10k MCG to start out. 10k MCG should build 5x 500 area bases


[18-May-22 01:41 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
allocater and myself are staging a few thousand BFABs on Phobos and are preparing to ship out. Now is a good time to get your base permits ready if you havent already


[18-May-22 01:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, please prepare some plans for relevant 500/500 area bases, and provide a bill of materials to make this base.


[18-May-22 01:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will be starting with RIG only, and will of course provide all the H2O on planet for our grow op


[18-May-22 01:44 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think we will need more rigs somehow, but this will be a decent start


[18-May-22 02:03 AM] allocater#0000
who can manage the PWO, COF and OVE reservoirs?


[18-May-22 03:31 AM] rune_242#0000
I could manage the PWO and OVE


[18-May-22 03:31 AM] rune_242#0000
Truss already made


[18-May-22 03:33 AM] rune_242#0000
Will take about a week or 2 to get the stock made


[18-May-22 03:36 AM] rune_242#0000
how big should the reservoir be?


[18-May-22 09:54 AM] allocater#0000
enough to supply all bases for 10 days, but not sure how much that would be


[18-May-22 10:11 AM] thummper#0000
I can save some COF up


[18-May-22 10:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ive been using 5 bases at roughly 1000 pioneers as my reference, so ~50k pioneer-days


[18-May-22 10:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but any amount is good, and at first i think it is wise to bring our own consumables to avoid getting stuck in the first week


[18-May-22 10:23 AM] allocater#0000
but then we all have to fly there, I was hoping some people can just teleport bases there once the expeditionary fleet lands with materials üòÑ


[18-May-22 10:24 AM] allocater#0000
for example I can bring lfabs and psl for 5 bases, then 4 people can teleport


[18-May-22 10:26 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats fine and all but it is like 4+ standard ships


[18-May-22 10:26 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
especially BDE, MCG, BBH. these are a bit bulky at these quantities


[18-May-22 12:19 PM] allocater#0000
yeah as long as we fill the ships, just don't want everybody to go half empty


[18-May-22 12:21 PM] allocater#0000
can we immediately set warehouse/LM prices to 0 after building the ADM?


[18-May-22 12:21 PM] allocater#0000
or will there be a 1 week election?


[18-May-22 12:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
1 week election

[18-May-22 12:44 PM] namthorn#0000
I can have a couple hundred excess water per day for crops I think if I bring over some PG. Planning on running mainly RIG/FP with a few FRM growing HER for KOM/FIM. Will get permit sorted after delivering the GEN.


[18-May-22 12:46 PM] allocater#0000
I think PG-less DW is cheaper if we have water that easily locally.


[18-May-22 12:47 PM] allocater#0000
will anyone run INC? It's a good planet to produce C, or is it too heavy to export?


[18-May-22 12:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Personally i think it is so heavy as to be incovenient that far away, but it would still make money


[18-May-22 12:50 PM] namthorn#0000
You could make C, get H from 401d and make PE


[18-May-22 12:51 PM] allocater#0000
that sounds promising


[18-May-22 12:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that is pretty meta. nice one namthorn


[18-May-22 12:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
could solve the overall problem


[18-May-22 12:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ehh, OVE problem.

{Reactions}
ü§£ 

[18-May-22 12:55 PM] namthorn#0000
Would lead to local OVE production and if theres any MGS around, PG


[18-May-22 12:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
to be fair though, shipping PG and PE is quite easy. it is the ingredients that are difficult


[18-May-22 12:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so much so that it is worth considering plastics wherever there is carbon üòÅ


[18-May-22 01:00 PM] namthorn#0000
Yea totally, it should however be more profitable than shipping the H back to say, phobos and then shipping the wrought product out, so there are some gains to be had there. Not much compared to the size of the OOG wallet, but still.


[18-May-22 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
those H flights are no fun


[18-May-22 01:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so sloooww


[18-May-22 01:05 PM] namthorn#0000
Is there any LST in the area? I just remembered the FEO on 401b and am now wondering if we could do yet more Bfabs locally ü§£


[18-May-22 01:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
401b is offline, about to be fully taken down to reclaim a base permit


[18-May-22 01:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[18-May-22 01:06 PM] allocater#0000
WU-070d has LST and FEO


[18-May-22 01:07 PM] allocater#0000
WR-186b more LST and easier to settle


[18-May-22 01:08 PM] allocater#0000
still almost as far away as nike


[18-May-22 01:08 PM] namthorn#0000
Boo, prob not worth then.


[18-May-22 02:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
I have 2K MCG in reserve. That's a full cargo.


[18-May-22 02:41 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Currently at 1.5k MCG on Heph, and 2.7k on ANT. Producing at about 160/day


[18-May-22 03:22 PM] domicius#0000
I make 1k a day, so just let me know how much you'll need from me.


[18-May-22 03:23 PM] domicius#0000
I was actually pumping out OVE/EXO, so I'll be a few hours getting back on full MCG prod


[20-May-22 02:33 AM] domicius#0000
I have 2.5k MCG now. Who wants it where?


[20-May-22 01:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I suppose it is time to fly, we have several shiploads of fabs and building mats

I will need some help on BDE and BBH transport


[20-May-22 01:54 PM] allocater#0000
can you donate before you have a base?


[20-May-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think not


[20-May-22 02:44 PM] allocater#0000
we probably have to consider that there won't be enough workers for weeks


[20-May-22 03:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is okay, we will make sure to have a bunch of open jobs, and probably build an infirmary at some point once we get a decent population going


[20-May-22 03:05 PM] allocater#0000
if bases are destroyed, are they taking their 200 workers with them?


[20-May-22 03:05 PM] allocater#0000

[21-May-22 10:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater can you build any core modules on KI-446?

ah, @rune_242 do you need a core module from me?


[22-May-22 02:04 AM] allocater#0000
yes, I have the full base materials


[22-May-22 03:43 AM] rune_242#0000
yes pls!


[22-May-22 04:11 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have mats for 1 core module (mine), plus a reserve of MCG (2,5 K) and Bfabs.


[22-May-22 04:48 AM] namthorn#0000
im bringing a CM kit too, so we can get 1 more person over


[22-May-22 05:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
When do we settle on KI-446b? Next week-end?


[22-May-22 08:13 AM] insensless72#0000
I think DLR is ready to get things in motion. Im sending a ship from Nike -Deimos this morning with my LDE, picking up TRU from Deimos, flying Deimos -> Phobos to buy @domicius MCG and then heading Phobos -> KI-446 so DLR can establish a base and get a head start on POPI. An exact timeline I dont have for you but id say you could probably head that way within several days]


[22-May-22 09:02 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have my construction mats ready. I may send one ship to KI-446b in a couple of days.

[22-May-22 10:55 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I forgot the LBH, so allocater will now bring those on his ship. Also, since I split my core module components between 2 ships, and have no inventory room, I now need to take a field trip to KI-439b* to borrow their warehouse and rearrange my inventory


[22-May-22 10:55 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

How much you all still need?


[24-May-22 11:12 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is unclear. It became apparent we did not have enough ships so i just started sending them

i can buy all of your mcg on phobos though, thanks for producing and holding it


[24-May-22 11:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
at least one more full 500t ship of mcg will be needed. likely 2


[24-May-22 11:14 AM] namthorn#0000
ye I'm gonna need to buy 1k of it I think, as DLR said it's mainly getting the goods out there. Stuff be heavy.

I can buy 500 nitrogen shiploads quite easily, but im not in a position to expand chemical production really

I was hoping to vertically produce NS at some point but havent looked into it


[24-May-22 02:27 PM] thummper#0000
my licence cancelled so all of my reoccurring ordered stopped - I have 60 COF spare and I think it was 250 needed for 5 bases for 10 days or something?


[24-May-22 02:28 PM] thummper#0000
I can fill that in the next 5 - 6 days but is that too late?

[26-May-22 04:08 AM] allocater#0000
still we need more than 200 migration per week


[26-May-22 04:08 AM] allocater#0000
how can we increase it?


[26-May-22 04:13 AM] namthorn#0000
not sure we can influence it too much atm. we have open jobs and a good happiness level. Are there any ADM programs focusing on pioneers?


[26-May-22 04:16 AM] namthorn#0000
I think there's some cap on migration to do with current population though, as the poprs i've looked at have the migration count growing as the pop on the planet does, while maintaining a near-constant level of happiness.


[26-May-22 04:18 AM] namthorn#0000
which would make some sense - it would be rather odd if 100k pops migrated over when the planet was only used to 1k


[26-May-22 05:54 AM] allocater#0000
maybe if happiness is 100% there is more migration than with 81%?


[26-May-22 06:24 AM] namthorn#0000
yea looked it up: Migration In = Current Population * (Happiness - 0.7)

{Reactions}
üëç 

[26-May-22 06:24 AM] namthorn#0000
so it's really capped by current population, can never be more than 0.3 * current population


[26-May-22 06:28 AM] namthorn#0000
so we could probably increase it by a couple hundred per week if we were to heavily invest in popi and max out happiness


[26-May-22 06:30 AM] namthorn#0000
probably not worth it to invest in education, comfort or culture, but an INF wouldn't be a bad idea. Would allow us to support more settlers too.

{Reactions}

[26-May-22 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The key ingredient is open jobs and happiness. There is a family support governor program which I think would apply well here


[27-May-22 03:11 AM] namthorn#0000
yea if we get an ADM up at the very least we can run either that or festivities to artificially boost happiness to 100


[27-May-22 04:16 AM] allocater#0000
why is happiness atm 81%? how would we get it to 100% without ADM?


[27-May-22 04:19 AM] namthorn#0000
filling all pop needs. And it's 81% because a) it wasn't 100% for the past few weeks - average happiness takes the past into account and b) pioneers have (small) needs in other categories than safety  & life support


[27-May-22 04:21 AM] allocater#0000
should approch 100% then over time, that 91% health can't impact it that much


[27-May-22 04:21 AM] namthorn#0000
it should cap out at around 90 something I think

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-May-22 04:22 AM] namthorn#0000
health has a 0.15 scaling so that's the last significant scaling for pioneers


[27-May-22 04:22 AM] namthorn#0000
0.05/0.03/0.02 for the other needs


[27-May-22 04:23 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, then we have to check if it's really worth raising from 90% to 100% with ADM


[27-May-22 04:24 AM] namthorn#0000
it could be, that's still going from 0.2* current pop to 0.3* current pop in migration


[27-May-22 04:24 AM] namthorn#0000
~200 extra pop at current pop levels


[27-May-22 04:25 AM] namthorn#0000
will matter less as we get a bigger number of pioneers on planet but that's a significant % increase in pop still given that we're limited by pioneers for expansion

@namthorn has there been any discussion about the cogc program? We should build a consensus in corp about what the best choice is now, next month, and in the permanent long-term


[28-May-22 07:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
For now I could suggest a PIO bonus. It will bring benefits across the board, for extracting water, for planting crops and for reprocessing in FPs.


[29-May-22 01:41 AM] allocater#0000
agreed on PIO, longterm maybe agriculture since it's basically a better harmonia


[29-May-22 02:06 AM] allocater#0000
is anybody doing a next or regular shipping already? then I can send the lfabs for ADM, I hope we have 750 MCG to spare already there


[29-May-22 05:02 AM] namthorn#0000
yea really depends what the prevalent industry is on world. I'd be down for pioneers for a while, but presumably agriculture would speed up the farming part of food chains, allowing for fewer space-intensive FRMs and more FP/INC etc


[29-May-22 05:04 AM] namthorn#0000
if everyone can update the KI-446b column of the OOG sheet when they get a chance, that'll give us a good view on the planet and what would help us out the most.

@Demeter ‚òùÔ∏è


[29-May-22 01:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn my suggestion is that we go with the 10% pioneer bonus. FRM, RIG, FP, BMP... This will be basically the entire planet.


[29-May-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, @namthorn ... Is it a good time for me to build the SST? I can do it right now.

EDIT: I see safety is already at 100% on the planet, so it is not needed yet.


[29-May-22 02:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Now that I look at it, the INF is equally easy to build. I could even do both of them. This seems excessive, but in the long term i think we can plan to have both of these


[29-May-22 02:25 PM] namthorn#0000
we already have a SST on world, it was here before we landed I think. INF is worth it imo, but we can't supply it until we get some TUBs shipped over so it's probably not worth doing yet.


[29-May-22 02:32 PM] namthorn#0000
once safety starts dipping as pops grow, we can build a 2nd SST so we don't need to supply anything but DW, 'till then I think we sit tight and use the bfabs for expansion


[29-May-22 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, noted on both points. I will wait


[29-May-22 02:34 PM] namthorn#0000
I'll work on getting some TUBs over in the meantime. Shouldn't need much for a single INF

Yea those are the most important weights per pop tier. pioneers are reasonably impacted by the level of health iirc. but it's half as important to a pioneer than a technician.


[03-Jun-22 11:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ahh i see


[04-Jun-22 12:56 PM] namthorn#0000
I have edited the LR to set all fees to 0 for LM/WAR as well as pioneers & settlers. for programs I think pioneer immigration is what we want at the moment so I will be going with that tomorrow if no one has any other suggestions

Taxes are theft


[04-Jun-22 01:01 PM] namthorn#0000
taxes where we are the government are subsidized anyway, sweet sweet dividends.


[04-Jun-22 01:01 PM] churavis#0000
We are stealing from ourselves then?


[04-Jun-22 01:01 PM] namthorn#0000
call it a loophole


[04-Jun-22 01:02 PM] namthorn#0000
effectively makes warehouses on Nike/Phobos free


[04-Jun-22 03:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think it is good to have no tax out there, at least for now...


[04-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, will start to levy tax once popi starts needing more than just simple upkeep


[05-Jun-22 05:29 AM] allocater#0000
would it make sense to set the worker reserve pool to 0%, since we want everybody to work and not sit in reserve just because someone might build something later?


[05-Jun-22 06:20 AM] namthorn#0000
not really an issue. the reserve pool is only taken from the unemployed population

[05-Jun-22 06:21 AM] namthorn#0000
if jobs exist at the time of a popr and there are sufficient workers on planet to fill all jobs, all jobs will be filled regardless


[05-Jun-22 06:22 AM] namthorn#0000
i dont think there's a situation where you can have workers effectively choose to become unemployed due to the reserve pool existing.


[05-Jun-22 06:26 AM] namthorn#0000
I also don't see if there's a way to change it in LR - seems to be a hardcoded 10%


[06-Jun-22 10:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BTW guys, I still have hundreds of BFABs and MCG to go with it.

my max base plan is 30+ RIG at 125%, so expect a ceiling aroud 1200 H2O/day


[07-Jun-22 03:16 PM] allocater#0000
my final base is planned to suck up 500/day


[08-Jun-22 01:40 AM] allocater#0000
I have 358 MCG more than I needed, selling for 20/u


[09-Jun-22 03:46 AM] namthorn#0000
popr is looking good. We're still fine on pop needs and growth is accelerating nicely. Though the number of open jobs seems to be increasing 0.o. I'll be running another pioneer immigration i think this week as 500 pioneers should still beat out the natural growth boost from family support III.


[09-Jun-22 12:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
what are the prices of these programs? i have noticed they are somewhat variable on phobos and im wondering if it is cheap on a small planet like this


[09-Jun-22 12:18 PM] namthorn#0000
the immigration i think are static costs. checked with the griffonstone gov about an engineer migration and it's 80k, same as KI-446b. pioneer immigration is 10k


[09-Jun-22 12:18 PM] namthorn#0000
i would check the others but i've already locked in the next program so cant see the drop-downs


[09-Jun-22 12:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Its the same across all planets then. Nike is also 80k for engineer immigration


[09-Jun-22 12:19 PM] namthorn#0000
the others might be variable though idk. What's festivities 3 on nike?


[09-Jun-22 12:20 PM] insensless72#0000
I can tell you in 6hrs


[09-Jun-22 12:20 PM] namthorn#0000
festivities 2 even, i know the cost for that is 22.5kish on griffonstone


[09-Jun-22 08:58 PM] insensless72#0000
pioneer immigration is 10k and festivities III is 36k


[10-Jun-22 09:48 AM] namthorn#0000
anyone want some DDT? I'm doing some small-time HER growing and have 99 DDT on the way if anyone wants a chunk.


[10-Jun-22 09:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
I would like some DDT. But actually do you have some somewhere closer to Harmonia?


[10-Jun-22 09:57 AM] namthorn#0000
I think I have more stored around somewhere, this is just what i loaded up to send to ki-446


[10-Jun-22 09:57 AM] namthorn#0000
got 39 arriving at the CX in a few hours


[10-Jun-22 09:58 AM] namthorn#0000
if you dont mind shipping it from there to harmonia i can sell it to you


[10-Jun-22 09:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
I posted a buy order on the CX for 6 DDT at 1551 AIC/u. Could you, please, sell it to me at that price?


[10-Jun-22 09:59 AM] namthorn#0000
can drop some off on nike on the way back too actually if you like


[10-Jun-22 10:00 AM] yang_mills#0000
That would be easier. What's your price?


[10-Jun-22 10:00 AM] namthorn#0000
i can do a better price than the CX bid I think, 1300/u?


[10-Jun-22 10:02 AM] yang_mills#0000

If I made a base on KI-446b, could I stack experts with an RIG/INC only or FRM only base? Would the corp need or be able to support either of those?


[10-Jun-22 02:33 PM] allocater#0000
full INC base we probably can't support yet, but we should work towards it, guess we need FRM subsidies! üòÑ


[10-Jun-22 02:33 PM] allocater#0000
or be the FRM you want to see on the planet üòÑ


[10-Jun-22 02:33 PM] churavis#0000
I mean, it wouldn't start out as a full base, just however much the PIO pop can support


[10-Jun-22 02:34 PM] allocater#0000
pop will fill all jobs next week I think, so that should no longer be a concern. crops supply is more of constraint


[10-Jun-22 02:35 PM] allocater#0000
but you could start an INC base and encourage others to fill up remaining space with FRMs


[10-Jun-22 03:17 PM] namthorn#0000
pls do, i will buy all your C, would save me from making the INC myself


[10-Jun-22 03:17 PM] churavis#0000
Can you give me GRN/HCP/MAI?


[10-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
i can give you some GRN


[10-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
dont have a ton of FRMs


[10-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
been expanding gradually, currently 3 FRM, 3 FP, 4 RIG


[10-Jun-22 03:18 PM] churavis#0000
If you had more H2O would you make more FRM's?


[10-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
i ideally want to drop BMPs next


[10-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
hence the need for C


[10-Jun-22 03:21 PM] namthorn#0000
could make a couple more FRMs though afterwards


[10-Jun-22 03:23 PM] namthorn#0000
been gradually adding on buildings so i still have about 1/2 base area to play with


[10-Jun-22 03:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
just seeing this. I am scaling to 30 RIG now along with pio numbers, always adding rig before the pop report


[10-Jun-22 03:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
long term, this is enough for 2-3 water consuming bases. well probably need another resource base, or at least more permits for mine


[10-Jun-22 03:39 PM] churavis#0000
OK, I know you said you have base module kits ready, what else do we have in terms of bfabs, mcg, consumables and burnables in stock? Would I need to make a trip out to bring stuff first?


[10-Jun-22 03:48 PM] namthorn#0000
you'll only have 200 pioneers to work with upon base start, so dont need too many burnables


[10-Jun-22 04:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ive got enough bfabs and mcg


[10-Jun-22 04:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
not sure about the current state of consumables and frm output. What are you guys doing with all of that H2O, anyways?


[10-Jun-22 04:48 PM] churavis#0000
Judging by the LM, you have DW and RAT but zero PWO and maybe OVE


[10-Jun-22 06:29 PM] namthorn#0000
i have 300 OVE in reserve


[10-Jun-22 06:29 PM] namthorn#0000
also planning on making some as soon as I can get some C to start the BMPs making PE


[10-Jun-22 06:31 PM] namthorn#0000
if you want some of that OVE stock, chuck up an ad at 60/u. was roughly the price i paid iirc


[11-Jun-22 02:24 AM] allocater#0000
I will try to supply all RAT/DW on the planet, so you don't have to build FPs. 240 surplus per day, which should be enough for 6 bases

[15-Jun-22 01:37 PM] allocater#0000
yup, it's better than harmonia


[15-Jun-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Indeed, it is like harmonia with better stats. This is the best food production planet in our quadrant of the galaxy, and its location is such that it is practically inaccessible for anyone other than Antares locals


[15-Jun-22 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Most of our players are already on harmonia, and yet we still have shortages on crops and water. This is despite rapid growth, so we needed a way to get a bunch of extra food-type bases quickly


[15-Jun-22 01:42 PM] churavis#0000
Our timing couldn't have been better given the recent shortage of C and related agricultural products

975 H2O per day after that report


[16-Jun-22 07:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
My base is now effectively maxed, 33 RIG, 990 pioneer. 30 area which I will keep in case something specific is needed, like STO.


[16-Jun-22 07:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am only 3/5 resource experts, no coffee, and 90 pioneers missing, so that 975 H2O will jump significantly.


[16-Jun-22 07:45 PM] churavis#0000
Are planning on exporting that or feeding local FRM's?


[16-Jun-22 09:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Local FRM and FP only


[16-Jun-22 09:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is most efficient to export rations and drinking water, or carbon if the OOG-3000 is involved.

Should I build more INC or RIG?


[16-Jun-22 09:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
personally I think RIGs are better because shipping carbon so far away is difficult


[16-Jun-22 10:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but some carbon and factory work is needed out here for practical purposes. I forget exactly where we got on that topic


[16-Jun-22 10:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
With that said, getting 1000C on a 3000t ship is feasible, and I think we expect to build more of these ships


[16-Jun-22 10:04 PM] churavis#0000
One of my main motivations for moving out here was not having to buy more C from the CX like I was doing. between AL and PE and possibly PG production, I'm going to need a ton


[16-Jun-22 10:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats fine, but it will be difficult to move. There is no way around that


[16-Jun-22 10:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You can build whatever you want, it makes sense to do INC and RIG together, i dont mean to discourage you


[16-Jun-22 10:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
of course you can use your own ships! üöÄüöÄ


[16-Jun-22 10:22 PM] churavis#0000
I'm sure I will be using my own ships. Between new corp members and corp ships helping with shipping amongst the starter planets, I haven't yet become shipping constrained.


[17-Jun-22 03:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn those building supplies and NS from my previous screenshot were brought here for the corp, maybe you can help me find homes for them?

I've been thinking that I'd like to do my second base on ki-446b. Probably go FRM heavy for someone else's INC, then a splash of FP . But I think I'm at least a week or two out before adding a second base.

DLR still has a base teleport package and bfabs. He can probably work out the financing with him or the bank-of-oog. I've got some MCG and H2O I'd give you as well

I've only got one base on Harmonia, but have started thinking about where I might build a second base. I've got some agriculture and extraction experts so was planning on making another base for FRM/INC. 

Would this be a good planet for that?

Also was toying with the idea of getting into the FP chain as well.

also @churavis @jackinabox86 , complete core module sets would be useful

[22-Jun-22 07:05 PM] exeler#0000

[22-Jun-22 07:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we made a point of getting the water supply established first, so its pretty much plug and play with FRM/FP


[22-Jun-22 07:06 PM] exeler#0000
I've not done a new base before, I'm guessing it's pretty expensive. What's a kit to start with maybe 2-4 FRM (and the huts to house the pioneers) go for?

If you could somehow organize a big nutrient solution shipment, that would be huge. I havent looked too much into it


[22-Jun-22 07:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it might be unavailable, or crazy expensive


[22-Jun-22 07:59 PM] exeler#0000
How much inutrient solution constitutes a big nutrient solution shipment?

I don't mind dedicating my ships to moving it if it's just in the wrong place. My base on Harmonia outputs only carbon from 2 INC and only need pioneer supplies as input, and I just learned I can buy most of those directly on Harmonia, so my two starter ships are effectively idle 90% of the time. 

I'm super low on capital so if I gotta buy the nutrient solution myself, that'll be the bottleneck. I could see about finding a supplier to put up sell orders and then someone with money could buy it and then use shipping contracts I can fulfill to move it?


[22-Jun-22 08:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
There‚Äôs been a lot of good shipping contracts up recently in ANT space, so if you aren‚Äôt grabbing those, they could be good around your own needs and this NS shipment. I‚Äôve somehow managed to juggle all that and not starve my people


[22-Jun-22 08:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@Demeter 

Moving forward, I would like to coordinate logistics to/from this planet on 10-14 day time frames, using our large ships.

Earthling, @exeler and @dersix should ideally plan to use KI-446b as a logistics hub for their gas collection and fuel production operations in KI-sector and IY-sector bases.

These operations lend themselves well to 2000t ships, so our prospective pilots for this route will be

I get hosed out there all the time


[04-Jul-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The main flight route will be Antares 1 --> KI-446


[04-Jul-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling and myself maintain an FF reserve already, so a ship with a small amount of slow fuel will not be stuck.


[04-Jul-22 02:26 PM] churavis#0000
Hephaestus, Phobos or CX?


[04-Jul-22 02:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is flexible, whatever works best for the pilot and the people sending stuff out there


[04-Jul-22 02:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if somehow it makes sense to start from a different system, thats fine too, but I assume this is the most reasonable route


[04-Jul-22 03:51 PM] archielvahr#0000

Are there any PWO or COF available out here? I want to stock up for my new HE base. If they're needed here I can send my ship back to Antares to pick up a load. ki-446b is closer though, so if anyone is flying out here, I'd really appreciate a little extra PWO and COF.


[06-Jul-22 06:10 PM] churavis#0000
I don't have any PWO in stock on KI-446b but I have plenty on Hephaestus, Harmonia and Deimos. I'll bring a bunch out on my next run in a few days.


[06-Jul-22 06:36 PM] exeler#0000
That'd be awesome. I'm guessing the LM here will end up being where I get most of my consumables?


[06-Jul-22 06:42 PM] churavis#0000
Thats up to you. I can stock more OVE and PWO out here if you want and there's always RAT and DW available. I think someone started COF production but I don't know how much they make now

if we've got a water problem, perhaps spamming more farms isnt the best of ideas


[06-Aug-22 11:46 AM] namthorn#0000
maybe incorporate some RIGs in there?


[06-Aug-22 11:48 AM] namthorn#0000
also I'll run a festivities III to increase migration in next popr. That should hopefully top up the reserve pool.

I'd be mildly worried about losing both zDLR and aChuravis, but I agree you've got some time before they catch on.  I'll certainly take water until then

[12-Aug-22 10:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
My max farm base on Demeter uses  ~450 water a week. So that's pretty good. If someone ads HYF, which they should do on a non-fertile planet anyway, that can go way higher. My Harmonia with 4 HYFs uses 3500 h20 per week


[12-Aug-22 10:46 PM] churavis#0000
Very seldom do you find a non-fertile planet with a large quantity of water

If HER is replanted in demeter, the transportation pressure can be greatly reduced.


[24-Oct-22 07:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
I solved my immediate pressure for a shipment


[24-Oct-22 08:19 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Sure, but Demeter to Nascent is a nice C making route.  I don't think Demeter to Norwick works as well


[24-Oct-22 08:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
The difference between the two schemes is that one has a long distance and a low frequency, while the other has a short distance and a high frequency. Compared with MAI, HER is very light.

[26-Oct-22 09:38 AM] allocater#0000
that's a good point, we could consolidate all HER production around ANT and switch that amount of farms on demeter to HER, but we need a buffer to overcome the ~1 week shipping lag


[26-Oct-22 09:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
If the output is not large, HER can last for a long time. In fact, it is better to share FP with DW. When HER is more, FIM is produced, and when her is less, DW is produced.


[26-Oct-22 09:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
Demeter can plant HER, icestation can produce water, norwick can produce FIM, DW, KOM and COF, and Harmonia can produce CAF and PIB.


[26-Oct-22 09:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think the overall income is higher than that of simply producing C and RAT.


[27-Oct-22 03:11 PM] namthorn#0000
how much is that buffer? I have 150 HER right here


[27-Oct-22 03:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think what he means is that an organizer is needed to coordinate transportation. After all, it's not worth a trip to demeter just for a person's HER.


[27-Oct-22 03:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
As far as my experience is concerned, 150 won't last a week


[27-Oct-22 03:15 PM] namthorn#0000
ah i thought you needed a buffer here


[27-Oct-22 03:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
150 can keep 7 FPs running for a week (Food Planet, five experts)


[27-Oct-22 03:17 PM] allocater#0000
yeah, if all farms around ANT stop HER, the HER consumption needs to survive until the first demeter HER shipment comes.


[27-Oct-22 03:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
Using FP together with products like DW can greatly improve the fault tolerance rate.


[27-Oct-22 03:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
If there are enough FPs, the delivered FIM will soon be consumed, and then other products will be produced, waiting for the next batch of FIM.


[27-Oct-22 03:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, that's what I did. Usually, my FP is producing DW until I ship HER and RAT there .


[27-Oct-22 03:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll keep going with FIM on Harmonia for the near term


[27-Oct-22 03:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can't keep up with my COF though, I am considering another FP for DW/COF, but it could be flexible with the FIM/MEA line too.


[27-Oct-22 03:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
Personally, I think Harmonia is more suitable for hydroponics and C crop production.


[27-Oct-22 03:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
Closer, more advanced population


[27-Oct-22 03:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the best place for HYF is 1) non fertile planet and 2) close to a good water source.

[27-Oct-22 03:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
HER production, only need to transport DDT and water in the past, and then transport the crops back. The import and export transportation tonnage is not large.


[27-Oct-22 03:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
Very consistent with demeter, which is mainly a pioneer population and far away.

[27-Oct-22 05:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
How much would you pay for CAF? I have something like 300 extra. At least in the short term. If I made a norwick base, it would probably be DW and COF


[27-Oct-22 05:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm about to do a base devoted primarily to COF, limited only by CAF supply. Short term I will have to source the CAF where I can/CX, so your CAF would be very welcome. Long term, I have plans to get a more stable supply.


[27-Oct-22 05:45 PM] dehzhas#0000

If there is enough interest, we can do a group pre-purchase agreement where I supply all the consumables for Demeter and a 2k/2k ship load coming back at least once per week.

Anyone make RCO here? I have a ship landing in 24 hours and I could really use some extra RCO (I am making it myself but apparently not enough and I can't switch any more of my FRMs from C ingredients)


[06-Jan-23 11:52 AM] churavis#0000
Bettino and Xenoarch have been known to make RCO on Harmonia at times


[06-Jan-23 12:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I can run some RCA through on my Harmonia FRMs.  Got more HER than I need


[06-Jan-23 12:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Just posted the math behind FRM RCO on #üçáharmonia and its not that good tbh


[06-Jan-23 12:36 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm producing around 25 RCO/d on Harmonia if you want some.


[06-Jan-23 04:55 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Awesome, how much can you sell now? And I can't find you on the sheet so just let me know your price üëç


[06-Jan-23 05:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Just started producing on Harmonia today so I've only got 12 atm, another 12 in 2 hrs. Would you like me to stock up a specific bulk amount, or just send the 24 batch to Demeter for now? As for price, whatever feels fair, CX prices right now are a bit wide at 700-610(with the vast majority of bids being OOG members lol), but I'll take whatever. I'm just doing this temporarily to help the supply glut until I figure out what to do. Did note @exeler & @optitronic have RCO listed on price sheet, so they might have a proper stockpile squirred away üôÇ


[06-Jan-23 07:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I doubt very much he uses it on Demeter

[06-Jan-23 10:08 PM] exeler#0000
I just posted a bunch of sell orders for C ingredients here if you want to pick those up and swap farms to RCO for a bit instead.

I make some RCO on Harmonia (about 7 per day right now as I'm just splitting excess HYF time between RCO and CAF). I've got 20 available on #üçáharmonia and another 100 available on #üè≠hephaestus  if you need it there.


[07-Jan-23 01:49 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yeah, I use the RCO on Phobos, but I can pick up on Harmonia. what is your current stock pile?


[07-Jan-23 06:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
48 RCO atm, 9 hrs til that becomes 60


[07-Jan-23 07:02 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll bring the 48 to ANT on this outbound shipment, that should get you closer to @exeler 's stockpile and save you the lengthwise trip

Lol, I probably don't need a whole cargo but 30 - 50 BSE if you've got it. (30 is my min build, 50 is my "optimal" for my new stuff). Just filling out the land you know?

Do you need MCG or consumables or anything else?

No, just the BSE. Mostly since my hauler just landed and I don't know where my brain was when I loaded up. Don't make a special trip though...

FRM because Demeter is one of the relatively few places where you _can_ FRM

Demeter is fertile, so you should use it for FRM/ORC. HYF can be built anywhere

Yeah like a good plan to me


[21-Mar-24 11:38 AM] churavis#0000
I would suggest letting the POP run down by ceasing festivities but still maintaining a minimum level of upkeep as upkeep based happiness changes slowly and you don't want to pendulum swing too far in the other direction.


[21-Mar-24 11:51 AM] emperyan11#0000
Yeah, I just triggered a festivity since I was away for a month and missed an upkeep period. Figured i'd count on the quick pop in happiness to tide us over until I caught up on upkeep

Except you have to vote every week, and many people don't bother because it's a pain every  week, and so fewer and fewer people vote until the situation where one large base can completely change it because no one else is paying attention

Hey gang, it's been a good run as governor but I don't think I'm going to stand in the election this time around. Did everything I needed to I think.

Looks like Hern and Sidepipe will be there to take over, so it should be a smooth transition

[14-Feb-25 09:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
@martin1194 what's up with the weird motions? I don't see the SST or INF supplied, but also the motions are really high for what they are. I just supplied them with what they actually need


[14-Feb-25 09:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
I also ignore Emperyan because he always fills everything and that's not what they need most of the time üòõ
