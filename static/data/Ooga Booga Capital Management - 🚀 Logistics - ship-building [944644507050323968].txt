@dasefx1 this is the shipbuilding channe;l


[19-Feb-22 11:20 AM] dasefx1#0000
great


[19-Feb-22 11:21 AM] dasefx1#0000
after dinner I will let you know my thoughts 🙂

[19-Feb-22 11:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is the standard ship i believe, for reference


[19-Feb-22 11:22 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the full blueprint is too big to capture on my laptop screen


[19-Feb-22 12:11 PM] dasefx1#0000
we plan to build this one

[19-Feb-22 12:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
from AML we need
60    BE
40    BOS
8    W
10    ZR
we already bought all BER ZIR, BTS and BOR on montem and katoa CX and should arrive in 3 days. I will give them @bitcoin_ape to you for 1 AIC


[19-Feb-22 12:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
and AML and SL are slowest buildings


[19-Feb-22 12:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
SL we need 
1    SNM
7    WAI
1    IMM


[19-Feb-22 12:14 PM] insensless72#0000
What do you need from ASM


[19-Feb-22 12:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
10    FET
40    FAL
228    AST
6    CTF
12    WAL
but I think kapusta already set up ASM


[19-Feb-22 12:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
I will do all APF, ELP, SCA, ECA, EDM, SE, SD, SL things


[19-Feb-22 12:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
rest was part of kapusta, but it is a lot and he can share


[19-Feb-22 12:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
I will need 10 DEC if someone can produce


[19-Feb-22 12:18 PM] insensless72#0000
i have 2 ASM up and running on deimos, I just need the W


[19-Feb-22 12:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
can we invite Kapusta to one channel ?


[19-Feb-22 12:21 PM] insensless72#0000
if we invite them to a channel they have to be in the whole discord


[19-Feb-22 12:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
so can we do all channels private, and one launge for others, and than when he join we can invite him to this private x


[19-Feb-22 12:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
other corps do like that


[19-Feb-22 12:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
they had public channels


[19-Feb-22 12:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
and rest private, depend on corp status


[19-Feb-22 12:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
?


[19-Feb-22 01:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can bring kapusta in, i will modify the discord later today


[19-Feb-22 01:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 10 ABH and figaro is producing the remaining AML AFABs on phobos now


[19-Feb-22 01:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the building should be ready in 6 days or less


[19-Feb-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also insensless has some stock of AST. I think he could build a SKF and make those necessary parts near the end when we are ready to build


[19-Feb-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 something i want to make sure of is that we make extra components whenever possible. of course we will prioritize the first ship as fast as possible, and some items are too difficult to make duplicates


[19-Feb-22 01:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but in general if it is easy to make multiple items in one go, we should do that so the next ship is easier


[19-Feb-22 01:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also @dasefx1 i will produce DEC on phobos


[19-Feb-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also… there is an elephant in the room. We have not discussed who will own the first ships that are produced.


[19-Feb-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the first one should go to yaro since he is producing most of the items


[19-Feb-22 01:43 PM] dasefx1#0000
I dont need first one :)total cost it can be high even few mln, so we can sold it 🙂


[19-Feb-22 01:44 PM] dasefx1#0000
we should plan it right, and find it out which part is longest to produce


[19-Feb-22 01:45 PM] dasefx1#0000
but I think worst is AML and SL


[19-Feb-22 01:46 PM] dasefx1#0000
hope that scientisc and eng grow will be good for next weeks, so faster we can produce it


[19-Feb-22 01:46 PM] dasefx1#0000
but I think first ship it can take one month 😄


[19-Feb-22 01:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
let me know how to help with fabs and cash. Afabs I had as well so I can help with tem


[19-Feb-22 01:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had 6 ASE and 4 ADE, so we need only 2 ADE for AML


[19-Feb-22 01:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
I open with SKF, AST and AML as most of it should be kapusta responsibility 😄


[19-Feb-22 01:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
my major part is electronics 😄


[19-Feb-22 02:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If we need 2 AML total, maybe you should build the second one with your AFAB


[19-Feb-22 02:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I suppose we could speed up by 3 days if I get those from you


[19-Feb-22 02:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but it seems like we have nearly 2 AML if you can find 10 ABH for yourself


[19-Feb-22 02:02 PM] dasefx1#0000
will we consider second AML on griffistone with earthing ?


[19-Feb-22 02:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think she prefers PP4.


[19-Feb-22 02:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I could do 2 AML on my base if this is preferable


[19-Feb-22 02:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
earthling will make an AML in time, but was not willing to commit to our rush schedule


[19-Feb-22 02:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Namthorn is an option if the griffonstone efficiency boost is required for an AML


[19-Feb-22 02:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have not spoken to him about shipbuilding or AML, but he is a smart player and communicates well


[19-Feb-22 03:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
I think best if you had all AML 😄


[19-Feb-22 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am happy to build it then if it is your fabs


[19-Feb-22 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
otherwise I can only afford 1 right now


[19-Feb-22 04:11 PM] dasefx1#0000
Sure, I can borrow you or sell you. Borrow cash. I am open


[19-Feb-22 04:18 PM] dasefx1#0000
However best to start from one, as waiting for eng is long process


[19-Feb-22 05:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
SPF for kapusta is fine if we had in corp


[19-Feb-22 05:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
ASM he already set up


[19-Feb-22 05:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
Also 2


[19-Feb-22 05:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
:/


[19-Feb-22 05:19 PM] insensless72#0000
Im going to keep my ASM up and running just cause id prefer to keep things in corp when possible. Is kapusta in a corp already?


[19-Feb-22 05:33 PM] dasefx1#0000
He is from AHI corp


[19-Feb-22 05:34 PM] dasefx1#0000
My previous corp


[19-Feb-22 05:34 PM] dasefx1#0000
We play together before reset


[19-Feb-22 05:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
kapusta is trustworthy i think, @insensless72 you will need large amounts of metal for the high load cargo bay that you want


[19-Feb-22 05:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im in a work call right now for a live event we support. cant do much discord for now


[19-Feb-22 06:01 PM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape I have 200+ both AST and FET. I was only asking to see if they might want to join. Would save a lot of time in settings if so


[19-Feb-22 06:06 PM] dasefx1#0000
Let him join discord first


[19-Feb-22 06:07 PM] insensless72#0000
https://discord.gg/QrUVbdxR


[19-Feb-22 11:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 I understand that this first ship is for profit and you want to limit people that it is divided between


[19-Feb-22 11:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I do want to announce that we are doing this to the whole corporation though, no later than tomorrow I need to give them a strategy update


[19-Feb-22 11:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
some will be excited to hear the progress, and will look forward to contributing and/or buying their own ship in the future.


[20-Feb-22 04:57 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape I don't care too much about profit, I do it for fun 🙂 to do sth to keep playing 😛  maybe kapusta will want first ship, I don't know. For me is not needed, as I don't want to expand I had 5HQ permit not used 🙂


[20-Feb-22 05:23 AM] dasefx1#0000
I didn't discuss too much with kapusta yet. It was spontaneous decision 😄


[20-Feb-22 05:24 AM] dasefx1#0000
so best when he will join us 🙂


[20-Feb-22 05:25 AM] dasefx1#0000
I send him inviation


[20-Feb-22 05:36 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape I had 2 ADE on CX, so all afabs are ready, only I need to transport it to phobos


[20-Feb-22 08:01 AM] insensless72#0000
Hello @kapusta0577 This is our ship building channel, you should have access now. Im looking forward to future cooperation for FTL ships!


[20-Feb-22 08:27 AM] kapusta0577#0000
thanks a lot. im heading to work now. but i should have some time tomorrow or Tue


[20-Feb-22 08:27 AM] kapusta0577#0000
ASM not set right now. but will be soon


[20-Feb-22 08:43 AM] insensless72#0000
I have 2 on Deimos


[20-Feb-22 09:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
ASM we will discuss tomorrow, but below I will write my thoughts

[20-Feb-22 09:11 AM] dasefx1#0000
here is our basic excel for FTL ship


[20-Feb-22 09:14 AM] dasefx1#0000
1. Pricing. As many things we should exchange. Rule for exchange is real cost + 20% profit


[20-Feb-22 09:17 AM] dasefx1#0000
2. From current line, I would like to do all electronics so APF, SD, SE, SL, EPL, EDM, SCA, ECA, CLR. So I would like that someone will take PPF, SME (excluding LI), WEL. POL, LAB, FS


[20-Feb-22 09:19 AM] dasefx1#0000
3. Priority to buy FTL ship had current members, and we pay final cost excluding extra profit


[20-Feb-22 09:20 AM] dasefx1#0000
4. If we sell FTL ship on auction. I think we can split profits like 25% kapusta 75% our corp. Between us I don't care how we split.


[20-Feb-22 09:20 AM] dasefx1#0000
5. Most importatnt is to figure out how to produce FTL ship regularly, like one per two weeks. Set up pricing, and finish excel


[20-Feb-22 09:22 AM] dasefx1#0000
I will try to add more fuction to excel now.


[20-Feb-22 11:12 AM] dasefx1#0000
I updated excel. Building sheet is most important


[20-Feb-22 11:13 AM] dasefx1#0000
AI - AN columns we need to share


[20-Feb-22 11:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kapusta0577 
@spatial_piano 
@insensless72 
@figaro0714 
@dasefx1 

Currently this channel is private and should only be viewable to these people and myself.

{Reactions}
👍 (3) 

[20-Feb-22 03:04 PM] dasefx1#0000
Excel updated. So only left ASM, FS, HWP and SME, so all mettalurgy. I think @insensless72 and @kapusta0577 should share together


[20-Feb-22 03:09 PM] dasefx1#0000
If @insensless72 already have 2 ASM, I think best if he keep it. HWP we can resign and buy from CX


[20-Feb-22 03:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
I think FS, can take @kapusta0577 and some of SME, AU, CU,STL and FE. @insensless72  can take SME for SI and AL


[20-Feb-22 03:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
it is my suggestion 🙂


[20-Feb-22 03:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
I open for discussion 😄


[20-Feb-22 03:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
@spatial_piano could you handle PSL and PSM ?


[20-Feb-22 03:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
insensless and I also think HWP is cheap on the market and we do not need to build one


[20-Feb-22 03:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
fully agree


[20-Feb-22 03:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. I only have 1 PPF currently but I can expand if necessary.


[20-Feb-22 03:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will make room for you in my phobos PG budget to accomodate this


[20-Feb-22 03:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
great 🙂


[20-Feb-22 03:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have the PSL ready I think, Just need to do PSMs


[20-Feb-22 03:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
great 🙂


[20-Feb-22 03:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
insensless will reply soon enough i think, but yesterday we discussed him building a normal WEL


[20-Feb-22 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also he will help me with FABs for an HBM on phobos


[20-Feb-22 03:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
WEL he can replace with kapusta, for me no difference


[20-Feb-22 03:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
I think best if them both share together 😄


[20-Feb-22 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if there is an overcapacity on welders, he can switch to MHL or something profitable


[20-Feb-22 03:17 PM] dasefx1#0000
for me he can take my WEL part, only first ship I done already ;D


[20-Feb-22 03:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 see above


[20-Feb-22 03:18 PM] dasefx1#0000
WEL for sure kapusta had 1 on deimos and 2 on gibson.


[20-Feb-22 03:19 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had 1 WEL on deimos


[20-Feb-22 03:19 PM] dasefx1#0000
kapusta extract HE on prism, so he had good HE source 😄


[20-Feb-22 03:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had 500 HE, which I will spend probably within 100 days


[20-Feb-22 03:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
from him 😛


[20-Feb-22 03:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
Still worst parts are AML and WAI


[20-Feb-22 03:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
rest should be easy 😄


[20-Feb-22 03:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had 0 scientisct now, but I had 55% boost on electronics, so hope next report will be nice


[20-Feb-22 03:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
and I can start production


[20-Feb-22 03:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
32 PSM is nearly 11 days on my current production, just under 10 days if I repair the PPF now. 48 PSLs would be 24 days. What's the target time for making a complete ship?


[20-Feb-22 03:24 PM] dasefx1#0000
I think first probably will take 1 month


[20-Feb-22 03:24 PM] dasefx1#0000
but future I think we should do 1 every two weeks


[20-Feb-22 03:25 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok, In that case I think I should go for 1 or 2 more PPFs in the long run


[20-Feb-22 03:25 PM] dasefx1#0000
good 😉


[20-Feb-22 03:27 PM] dasefx1#0000
also furure BAC, I can give someone to do it. As I only had one LAB


[20-Feb-22 03:27 PM] dasefx1#0000
even not me, only gazprom


[20-Feb-22 03:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
There's the SPF on the sheet marked for me. I'm quessing that isn't needed until later when the other components are starting to come out?


[20-Feb-22 03:28 PM] dasefx1#0000
exactly


[20-Feb-22 03:29 PM] dasefx1#0000
in next ship I can give as well someone all SME (CF) and WEL (FLP, FC,GV)


[20-Feb-22 03:29 PM] dasefx1#0000
as current one I done. and GV probably for next 5 ships as well


[20-Feb-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will see if any smaller players are interesting in smelting for us, that one is pretty accesible on several planets


[20-Feb-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
no rush on that part though.


[20-Feb-22 03:29 PM] dasefx1#0000
good 🙂


[20-Feb-22 03:43 PM] insensless72#0000
@dasefx1 @kapusta0577 I am more than willing to collaborate with anyone on what needs to be done. Ill keep the 2 ASM running. Currently i have over 200 of AST, FET, and FAL ready to be used (most is on the market but I can pull them off) I have room on all my planets for expansion so let me know what buildings we need and I can slap them up on Deimos or Nike within a day or 2

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[20-Feb-22 04:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Correction about the PPF production times, I got the needed amounts mixed. so for 32PSL and 48 PSM, it's going to take 16 days each.

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[21-Feb-22 07:36 AM] kapusta0577#0000
thats great. i think we need 4-5ASM total to run it smoothly. it looks for me that SME and ASM is most time consuming in ship making. good thing is quite easy. i have also commitment to AHI, so i will put 1 extra ASM for that. on the other hand most of ASM product going into SKF which have very fast recipes. 
About a profit - 25% for me looks like far to much. 10% sound more fair, or we can calculate how much time and effort everyone put in. But to be honest im not really care about cash in game right now, as i have more than i need
as well im not looking for first ship. im afraid that when i get ship my logistic become very simple and boring, and i stop playing or COLIQ


[21-Feb-22 07:40 AM] kapusta0577#0000
landing on Deimos in 18h

[21-Feb-22 07:42 AM] kapusta0577#0000
i have 90BOR on Deimos. im processing TCO into ETC on Nike


[21-Feb-22 09:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
Ok I will take all BTS, BER, BOR, and ZIR


[21-Feb-22 09:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
and deliver to DLR on phobos


[21-Feb-22 09:03 AM] dasefx1#0000
So I suggest we share 15% kapusta to 85% OOG 🙂


[21-Feb-22 09:08 AM] dasefx1#0000
and I shared final excel


[21-Feb-22 09:09 AM] dasefx1#0000
so ASM I split between @kapusta0577 and @insensless72 plus I add to Insensless FS and part of SME


[21-Feb-22 09:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape do you have some BTS, BER, BOR or ZIR to start AML before I deliver rest ?


[21-Feb-22 09:11 AM] dasefx1#0000
AUO is easy to buy on CX for MM price. and CUO or CU can deliver Dominicus


[21-Feb-22 09:13 AM] dasefx1#0000
@kapusta0577 let me remind what prices you paid for  BTS, BER, BOR, and ZIR?


[21-Feb-22 09:15 AM] kapusta0577#0000
BER 320; MAG 200; ZIR 500; BTS 500


[21-Feb-22 09:26 AM] kapusta0577#0000
i can get BER 180/u from PiBoy on SE-648b


[21-Feb-22 09:34 AM] dasefx1#0000
and your BOR price ?


[21-Feb-22 10:05 AM] kapusta0577#0000
i dont know. 1/u?


[21-Feb-22 10:11 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
no, i have none, but I have an opportunity to buy some at ANT when I pick up your afab shipment


[21-Feb-22 10:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape when you will land on ANT ?


[21-Feb-22 10:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
buy minimum stock for max 2 days, all other I will bring you probably tomorrow evening


[21-Feb-22 10:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok, i will buy a tiny amount in this case


[21-Feb-22 11:52 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also I am preparing to build a small BTS extraction base once the AML is started. TSH and base building supplies are being produced now.

Oh, for future reference @kapusta0577 @dasefx1 :

I have free ZIR on KI-401b for all OOG shipbuilding needs

👍🏻 

[21-Feb-22 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is very heavy, but also needed in small quantities, so it should be manageable


[22-Feb-22 04:57 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape in 7h on phobos will land 40 BTS, 20 ZIR, 50 BOR and 88 BER. List for 1 AIC


[22-Feb-22 10:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
listing, thanks

[22-Feb-22 10:35 AM] dasefx1#0000
ADE I fullfiled already


[22-Feb-22 10:35 AM] dasefx1#0000
so you can build AML today 😄


[22-Feb-22 10:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there is one more delay. I am waiting on RDE for my HBM


[22-Feb-22 10:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
earthling has them in production on phobos now, 2 days production


[22-Feb-22 10:40 AM] dasefx1#0000
how many needed ?


[22-Feb-22 10:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
I had 19


[22-Feb-22 10:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
8


[22-Feb-22 10:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
Also I moved all FS smelting to myself, I will have 3 FS instead 2


[22-Feb-22 10:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
ok list them

👍 

[22-Feb-22 11:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
looks like AML starts with technicians only in 24 hours, then within 5 days i can swap HB3 for HBM and get up to full speed


[22-Feb-22 11:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also im prepping to settle a BTS extraction base with 3 RIG in this same 5 days


[22-Feb-22 11:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
after this, I will focus on getting 10 more ABH to build another AML


[22-Feb-22 11:43 AM] dasefx1#0000
excellent


[22-Feb-22 05:23 PM] insensless72#0000
Building my FS today, what items are recommended I start with?


[22-Feb-22 05:24 PM] insensless72#0000
MFK SFK?


[22-Feb-22 08:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
hard to go wrong with these


[23-Feb-22 03:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
@insensless72 if you start I will add you more


[23-Feb-22 03:04 AM] dasefx1#0000
as I was not sure if you will take them 🙂


[23-Feb-22 03:05 AM] dasefx1#0000
CUO I should have delivery in few days from dominicus so I can share with you on phobos


[23-Feb-22 03:07 AM] dasefx1#0000
13 Scientiscs arrived 😄


[23-Feb-22 05:44 AM] insensless72#0000
@dasefx1 I honestly skimmed over that message. That's okay keeps yours up and running, I can shift production to another building or expand on SME


[23-Feb-22 06:34 AM] dasefx1#0000
@insensless72 please better do it, as I can have problem with it. My electronics already use 3 FS

great 🙂


[24-Feb-22 12:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have come to my senses and decided not to build HBM. AFABs are too valuable, it is a waste to use them on hab units.


[24-Feb-22 12:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
now I have HB3, HB4, and AML. 10 more ABH will build the second AML, since I already have the other afabs on phobos.


[24-Feb-22 12:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is thanks to @figaro0714 , who is kindly providing PP4 production time on short notice.


[24-Feb-22 04:31 AM] dasefx1#0000
execellent


[24-Feb-22 01:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's a good thing you brought that up. I was thinking af building a HBL for the SPF, but since the workload on SPF is much smaller than the other parts of the ship pipeline it makes much more sense to just run the line with Engineers only.

[25-Feb-22 04:29 PM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano My SKF and MFK are destined for you. I have them on Deimos currently but will be transporting them soon to Nike. Do you want to go ahead and take what I have when it gets there? Idk how close yo uare to needing them


[25-Feb-22 04:44 PM] spatial_piano#0000
For the engine production right? I don't have the SPF yet, so there is no hurry, I can pick the up from Nike next time I'm there.


[25-Feb-22 04:47 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds good, I wont rush it there then. Just let me know when youre close to needing it and ill be happy to supply


[26-Feb-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 
@kapusta0577 

This weekend I will transfer @spatial_piano the 2440 PG, and begin production of 10 DEC. These could take up to 7 days total.


[26-Feb-22 02:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
great 🙂


[26-Feb-22 03:57 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@kapusta0577 I'm half way done on the PSMs and the PSLs are ready for the UPF items, and apparently you will be the one taking them over. Where do you need them?


[26-Feb-22 03:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The rest will be done in 4 days.


[26-Feb-22 04:30 PM] dasefx1#0000
On nike he need 😉


[26-Feb-22 04:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000

Hey. I'm going to need Rfabs for SPF + HB4, but when and from who should I get them?


[28-Feb-22 11:05 AM] dasefx1#0000
@spatial_piano still we have time. Let me know how many total we need ?


[28-Feb-22 11:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
insensless has PP3 on Nike I think


[28-Feb-22 11:08 AM] spatial_piano#0000
```RBH    12
RDE    10
RSE    6
RTA    6```


[28-Feb-22 11:09 AM] spatial_piano#0000
+ 14 TRU, but I think I have them in store already


[28-Feb-22 11:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can provide 1 RDE on Phobos 😁

🙌 

[28-Feb-22 11:32 AM] dasefx1#0000
next week I think it earliest to set up it. I had almost all of them now.


[28-Feb-22 02:16 PM] spatial_piano#0000
A question: do workforces consume materials from WAR, or only from the base inventory?


[28-Feb-22 02:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm looking at the workload for SPF and it seems that at the pace of 1 ship/2 weeks the SPF is running only 83% of time even with just Engineers, only basic consumables and no experts. I was thinking if moving the Engineer consumables to WAR if there is nothing to work on would work. Other costs are not that big, but FIM alone costs nearly 4k/day/50 ENG.


[28-Feb-22 02:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I dont think that they consume from the warehouse


[28-Feb-22 02:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok, that's good. If I run 11 days with all basic consumables and then 3 days without food I can get the factory to run full time at the pace of 1 set/14 days.


[28-Feb-22 02:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's probably a bit difficult to get right, but leaving out FIMs saves a lot of money.


[28-Feb-22 02:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im testing the warehouse trick now on Nike


[28-Feb-22 02:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ill let you know if my production gets blocked or not 🙂


[28-Feb-22 02:41 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Hope it's not anything too costly


[28-Feb-22 02:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will check every 30 minutes now for fear of lost production


[28-Feb-22 02:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but as soon as I see my consumables blocked, I can move everything back and have minimal impact.


[28-Feb-22 02:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For science!


[28-Feb-22 02:42 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think the rate only resets when the next tick comes in, so you might have to wait for an entire day to see the effect.


[28-Feb-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, two worker types at least, they dont tick at the same time if I remember right


[28-Feb-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since i didnt start the buildings at the same time, they are offset


[28-Feb-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
(I think)


[28-Feb-22 02:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we will see, though. worst case scenario is really not so bad.


[28-Feb-22 02:44 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think you can test it with only 1 material. That will take the production down a bit, but not cripple it.


[28-Feb-22 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, I will remove only EXO.


[28-Feb-22 02:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ill let you know what I see in 24 hrs


[28-Feb-22 02:46 PM] spatial_piano#0000
That will halve the production if it works, but I think the rate goes back up the moment you bring them back.


[28-Feb-22 02:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it does, and it would only affect my PP2s for a short while


[28-Feb-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im  not worried, all of the urgent orders are covered


[28-Feb-22 03:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
warehouse trick for sure is working 🙂

on Nike none. all on Deimos


[28-Feb-22 04:04 PM] kapusta0577#0000
200 on Deimos. and 20 going to SPF and 8 for ECA


[28-Feb-22 04:12 PM] insensless72#0000
I thought you were on Nike so I shipped thhem earlier 🙃 I have 100 ready as soon as they get back and 200 on the market I could either sell you there or ship to Deimos


[28-Feb-22 04:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The remaining rfabs I need for SPF and hab are ```
RDE    10
RTA    2```


[28-Feb-22 04:24 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill have the RBH and 4/6 RTA in 12hrs


[28-Feb-22 04:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah I could wait for those before I return to Phobos.


[28-Feb-22 04:28 PM] insensless72#0000
Theyre on a ship headed to Nike, we can do the ads now if you want


[28-Feb-22 04:29 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok.


[28-Feb-22 04:41 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@kapusta0577 32PSL and 24 PSM are now on Nike. You can post them at 1, or if you want you can wait until I ship in the other half of the PSMs. Just remind me to pick the ads up if you post.


[28-Feb-22 04:44 PM] kapusta0577#0000
i can take it on Nike and ship it back. no problem


[28-Feb-22 04:45 PM] kapusta0577#0000
i can wait


[28-Feb-22 04:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. the latter half will be ready in 2 days and shipping will take 1 day if I time things right.


[28-Feb-22 05:04 PM] insensless72#0000
They will be on Nike in 12hrs, sorry about that


[28-Feb-22 05:42 PM] dasefx1#0000
When I had free day I will figure out some way for exchange items by real cost plus small profit. Set up prices for all items. Now we can exchange by 1 aic, but in the end we should calculate all fairly


[28-Feb-22 06:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm actually making a spreadsheet for calculating the split.

[28-Feb-22 07:03 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's still a work in progress. I've added my and DLRs portion since we had the least individual items.


[01-Mar-22 04:39 AM] dasefx1#0000
good 🙂 I am lazy so good that you did it 🙂 
I had question will we consider things which we bought from CX or other players? Like I bought HCP, S, BOR, BER etc? Plus for example if DLR produce PG, how he should consider spent MG, C and H ? Or only consider if you use INC or EXT for it ? 
and good point is to calculate what is cost of producing one FTL ship, not sure if this formula will show this ?


[01-Mar-22 04:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
I saw purchases column 🙂 so it is probably for that 🙂


[01-Mar-22 04:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
so I created sheet purchases.


[01-Mar-22 01:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Very good point. I think for natural resources it might be better to count them as purchased, since the workforce costs depend on the planet they are mined on. I've now added all the items I found on the FTL ship sheet, but I think everyone should double check the amounts. Also, now any purchases added on the purchases page will automatically be counted towards the total amounts.


[01-Mar-22 01:35 PM] spatial_piano#0000
One thing I haven't yet added are the costs for HABs, and the planet dependent fabs like MCG, INS etc.


[01-Mar-22 01:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Also I have deliberately left out experts and CoGC bonuses. This is because these would bring the costs of the person using them down, which would mean their cut would be smaller. We of course don't want to punish people for using experts and CoGC bonuses to their advantage, so it's better to estimate the costs at 0 bonus efficiency. Only maluses to efficiency from less than full workforce upkeep and insufficient workforce are calculated. This is important expecially for higher level buildings and POPs, since it's harder to get a full employment, and the upkeep items are more expensive.


[01-Mar-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
consider my PG worth 16.5 each and EPO worth 50 each


[01-Mar-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
guaranteed I would have sold them in corp at these prices if I did not use them on the ship instead, so this is an easy short cut for me


[01-Mar-22 02:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
unless you are looking for my true cost to produce 1 PG, and 1 EPO


[01-Mar-22 02:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in which case it is more like 8-11 for PG and 30-37 for EPO, depending most on carbon price


[01-Mar-22 03:01 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think that to keep things comparable and consistent it's better to mark the PG ingredients as purhcases, so yes we are looking more at the production costs. everything else is counted by the production cost. The workforce and building maintainace costs are already calculated so the raw material is the only portion missing.


[01-Mar-22 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
okay then, in this case I will find my latest bulk order prices for carbon, hydrogen, and MG


[01-Mar-22 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
300 for Carbon


[01-Mar-22 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
50 for Magnesium


[01-Mar-22 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
36 for Hydrogen


[01-Mar-22 03:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. they are now listed


[01-Mar-22 03:13 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@dasefx1 What consumables you are providing for the scientists on your SL?


[01-Mar-22 03:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
And how many scientist do you have?


[01-Mar-22 03:30 PM] dasefx1#0000
@spatial_piano for scientiscts all of them, for engineers all excluding GIN. I had now 13 from 40 needed


[01-Mar-22 03:32 PM] dasefx1#0000
I will sit tomorrow to excel and add all purchases 🙂


[01-Mar-22 03:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
What are the prices WS and VG by the way?


[01-Mar-22 03:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000

[01-Mar-22 03:34 PM] dasefx1#0000
WS 6k, VG 3-3.5k WIN 5k


[01-Mar-22 03:36 PM] dasefx1#0000

[01-Mar-22 03:36 PM] dasefx1#0000

[02-Mar-22 07:08 AM] dasefx1#0000
all purchases filled in excel. Loan I don't know how to put, so I leave it below


[02-Mar-22 07:33 AM] spatial_piano#0000
For now I marked the loan for same value as if those were counted for your maintainace costs instead of DLRs, meaning (total loan/180)*(the production time for the ship) is moved from DLRs total to yours, and also removed from the principal of the loan. Of course the final agreement on how you two want to deal with the loan is between you two, and this is just my suggestion.


[02-Mar-22 09:11 AM] dasefx1#0000
sure 🙂 fine for me 🙂


[02-Mar-22 10:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

I removed all PP1, PP2 and BMP, keep 2 PP3 and 1 PP4 for some time


[03-Mar-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 will you keep up with other electronics?


[03-Mar-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thanks for the warning. I will continue to play until the end, I am too proud of OOG to quit 😄


[03-Mar-22 02:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
not sure yet 🙂 FLT ship is complicated with electronics 😄


[03-Mar-22 02:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
I will inform you earlier what Iwill decide


[03-Mar-22 02:41 PM] dasefx1#0000
As I need to do some planning first


[03-Mar-22 02:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can deliver 10 DEC in 18 hours


[03-Mar-22 04:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
All WAI produced, now one per 17 h


[03-Mar-22 08:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
amazing


[04-Mar-22 05:53 AM] insensless72#0000
78 AST on Deimos @kapusta0577 post a buy for whatever you need and ill fill when I can


[04-Mar-22 01:42 PM] dasefx1#0000
I decided to do only Software from 2nd ship. Rest is too complicated for me


[04-Mar-22 04:27 PM] insensless72#0000

[05-Mar-22 12:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there is 2 more Tungsten in production now, and after that I will focus 100% on BE


[05-Mar-22 12:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh @kapusta0577 this BOS is for you. Not enough for a CHA yet.

I can split the BE production I just discussed with some BOS production since they work well together.


[05-Mar-22 12:22 PM] dasefx1#0000
ok I will wait for more. as ECA is very fast, and W I need all to start


[05-Mar-22 12:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for the FFC, I will have 1 more tungsten in 1 hour


[05-Mar-22 12:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you can post the buy for 5 W now (1 AIC of course)


[05-Mar-22 12:47 PM] dasefx1#0000

[05-Mar-22 05:15 PM] kapusta0577#0000
sorry. fixed


[05-Mar-22 05:16 PM] kapusta0577#0000
can i get that on Deimos?


[05-Mar-22 05:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes I will arrange to send it to deimos


[05-Mar-22 06:23 PM] insensless72#0000
Which plant is it on?


[05-Mar-22 08:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
phobos


[06-Mar-22 05:12 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think I can do ECA as well for FTL ship. APF I will delete in few weeks. I will add extra stock, which I had for next ships


[06-Mar-22 01:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 have you talked with Domicius about this transition? Maybe he would be able to take over some of this electronics production on Phobos


[06-Mar-22 01:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
just a passing thought


[06-Mar-22 01:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kapusta0577 bringing 10 BOS and 10 DEC to Deimos now.


[06-Mar-22 01:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
please post buy offers for 1 AIC on Deimos so I can transfer these to you


[06-Mar-22 03:09 PM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape hard to say. He can try. But it will be hard for him.


[06-Mar-22 03:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
I think first need to be set up support, so enough things for FS, CLR, SCA Than set up ELP and APF


[06-Mar-22 03:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
I plan to keep APF only till I will use all 185 BMF, so quiet long. Only you will need provide all parts needed.


[06-Mar-22 03:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
ELP I want reduce to produce only SAR for Drones


[06-Mar-22 03:17 PM] dasefx1#0000
but still I can help with BMF and BWS for some time. AWF I had enough for 4 ships


[06-Mar-22 03:17 PM] dasefx1#0000
AAR for 1 ship


[06-Mar-22 03:18 PM] dasefx1#0000
my conclusion is if you provide me exact items I can smelt sth for you on APF or ELP


[06-Mar-22 03:19 PM] dasefx1#0000
only I dont  want to find all this items, move from here to here


[06-Mar-22 03:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
EDM RAD is enough for 6 ships, so EDM no needed


[06-Mar-22 03:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
ECA I can help, as ECA is fast


[06-Mar-22 03:25 PM] dasefx1#0000
I marked by Magenta colour easy things for me, and light magenta for things which I can do if you give me all items on right planet 🙂


[06-Mar-22 04:09 PM] kapusta0577#0000
what price? 1AIC?


[06-Mar-22 04:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, 1 AIC


[06-Mar-22 04:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

1 AIC is fine I think since that was what DLR charged for the raw mateials. If you post the buy's on Nike I can fulfill when I see them. Ping me when the ads are up.

@insensless72 how much CTF do you have?


[11-Mar-22 10:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ultimately we need to bring it to yaro on Phobos, and I have 1 tungsten remaining which I think needs to be used for CTF. In this case I will bring it to Deimos


[11-Mar-22 10:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kapusta0577 bringing the remaining 30 BOS and this last W to Deimos today.


[11-Mar-22 11:24 AM] insensless72#0000
I have 4 CTF, yaro needs 6. Your 1 W will make the last 2 CTF needed


[11-Mar-22 02:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok, it will arrive tonight


[11-Mar-22 04:57 PM] kapusta0577#0000

BOS posted how many W?


[11-Mar-22 05:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[12-Mar-22 04:17 PM] dasefx1#0000

i can deliver it later to Phobos


[20-Mar-22 07:42 AM] kapusta0577#0000
@spatial_piano THP will be ready when i come back from work. do you want me to ship it to Phobos?


[20-Mar-22 12:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 @spatial_piano one of you has FAL, the other needs FAL for the ship


[20-Mar-22 12:43 PM] insensless72#0000
I have the 40 FAL at ANT


[20-Mar-22 12:45 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@kapusta0577  Phobos is good, but I decided to put the SPF on ANT I C. You can drop them off on either planet. @insensless72 I'll put up a buy for 40@1 on ANTCX


[20-Mar-22 12:45 PM] insensless72#0000
Do it on the LM


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ANT1C? yopu can't trade items on CXLM, only shipping


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] insensless72#0000
ahh welp nvm lol

it wouldnt have mattered much anyways and yw

[21-Mar-22 02:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ok, thanks for all of your contribution, @kapusta0577 kapusta. Sorry to see you go after just meeting you. We were happy to collaborate, however briefly.


[21-Mar-22 02:13 PM] kapusta0577#0000
see you next universe


[23-Mar-22 07:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano how is the progress on the engines?


[23-Mar-22 07:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 it seems we are nearly complete, how would you like to pursue the auctioning?


[23-Mar-22 07:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Should we start talking on the UFO server?


[24-Mar-22 03:38 AM] dasefx1#0000
we can try similar like with STL auction on forum, plus ads on UFO + prun chat


[24-Mar-22 08:58 AM] spatial_piano#0000
SPF parts will be ready in 8 days if I can get more FIM shipped from Harmonia within 3 days.


[24-Mar-22 09:01 AM] insensless72#0000
I have 20 FIM on Harmonia, no way to get it to you though


[24-Mar-22 09:01 AM] insensless72#0000
Unless someone takes a shipping ad to Phobos


[24-Mar-22 09:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I've had an ad up for moving the 20 FIM I already bought from you so I'm thinking I'll just make a trip myself. Do you need more AMM? I have a bit over half of a ship arriving to CX I could bring while I'm there.


[24-Mar-22 09:11 AM] insensless72#0000
Absolutely, I'll take whatever you bring


[24-Mar-22 09:17 AM] dasefx1#0000
@spatial_piano I can give you fim for 1 aic, and when you get I will give you back


[24-Mar-22 09:17 AM] dasefx1#0000
If you have SPF on phobos


[24-Mar-22 01:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's on ANT I C, so I think it's easier to just get it directly from Harmonia.


[26-Mar-22 07:38 AM] insensless72#0000
After we auction this FTL ship, how complicated would producing STL ships for Ant 1 members be?


[26-Mar-22 12:55 PM] spatial_piano#0000
STL seems a lot simpler.

Left is the same as the basic ship but without Reactor


[26-Mar-22 01:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
STL better with glass engine, as it is cheaper in my opinion


[26-Mar-22 01:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
but I am not expert 🙂


[26-Mar-22 01:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
seems that regular engine saves about 16% on fuel on PHO->ANT trip. 20% on the travel and 11% on the take-off. Glass is much cheaper tho.


[26-Mar-22 01:46 PM] spatial_piano#0000
~~I'm looking at the Fuel saving engine at the simulator and it seems like it is bugged. There doesn't seem to be any savings VS a regular engine. ~~On the other hand, the FSE might actually be cheaper to make than ENG. It uses PPF produced fuel pumps, and uses BRO instead of AST. the downside is that it needs 2 more NOZ than the regular engine, so it might be a tossup which one is cheaper.


[26-Mar-22 01:49 PM] spatial_piano#0000
NVM the Fuel saving pump works. I hadn't saved the blueprint


[26-Mar-22 01:55 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Also since the top acceleration is capped by the G-factors FSE is actually just as fast as ENG unless the ship has High-G seats.


[26-Mar-22 04:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
does the fuel saving engine require WAI for a flow control device or something like that? Im not in front of the game atm


[26-Mar-22 04:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its preferable to minimize WAI usage because they are hard to come by


[26-Mar-22 04:21 PM] allocater#0000
ENG and FSE have WAI

GEN has no WAI

I added a STL tree to our FTL ship sheet and also Allocated to the Ship building channel as he was asking if we could do it


[26-Mar-22 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I have FIM on Phobos


[26-Mar-22 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Do you still need this?


[26-Mar-22 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Sorry I have been absent, I took on some project work in real life and it has been very time consuming


[26-Mar-22 11:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have enough FIM now


[27-Mar-22 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@everyone what do you think?


[27-Mar-22 05:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also @spatial_piano when will the engine components be ready for this ship?


[27-Mar-22 08:23 PM] insensless72#0000

[28-Mar-22 03:23 AM] dasefx1#0000
cargo bay should be different


[28-Mar-22 03:24 AM] dasefx1#0000
and cross hull plates as we don;t have it


[28-Mar-22 03:25 AM] dasefx1#0000
for previous we had wrong parts 🙂


[28-Mar-22 03:26 AM] dasefx1#0000
also I will mention that ship had large cargo


[28-Mar-22 03:26 AM] dasefx1#0000
and that we accept all currencies


[28-Mar-22 03:26 AM] dasefx1#0000
also mention when auction is ending


[28-Mar-22 03:27 AM] dasefx1#0000
and I think better if bids will be on forum than on LM


[28-Mar-22 03:27 AM] dasefx1#0000
if we accept only AIC I am sure that we will not sell this ship as most money is in montem area


[28-Mar-22 03:30 AM] dasefx1#0000
we need many buyers, as I think we can get even 3mln for ship


[28-Mar-22 03:30 AM] dasefx1#0000
if one buyer we will get 2mln


[28-Mar-22 03:31 AM] dasefx1#0000

also I think it is good to mention all ship producers in message 🙂


[28-Mar-22 03:32 AM] dasefx1#0000
it is my suggestions based on previous auctions


[28-Mar-22 10:57 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@bitcoin_ape Engine will be ready in 3.5 days. Reactor is already complete.


[28-Mar-22 10:58 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks @dasefx1 I will follow all of your recommendations. I meant to have the bidding on the forum, and the ultimate item transfer on the LM. I will make that more clear


[28-Mar-22 10:59 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Good to know @spatial_piano . Before you tear down this SPF, lets try to make some additional engines while we have it running


[28-Mar-22 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yaro and myself have supplies on phobos, I need to look closely but I think we could knock out some difficult items for ship 2


[28-Mar-22 11:00 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Regular ENGs or something else?


[28-Mar-22 11:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
FTL reactor and glass engines mainly


[28-Mar-22 11:01 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Do those go together?


[28-Mar-22 11:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they go together on one ship, but GEN is slow fuel burning and RCT is fast fuel


[28-Mar-22 11:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh wait, im a fool, GEN doesnt require SPF


[28-Mar-22 11:03 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah.


[28-Mar-22 11:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
let me pull up the spreadsheet so i can speak inteligently about this


[28-Mar-22 11:05 AM] spatial_piano#0000
For the RCT I'll need CBS, AST and RAG


[28-Mar-22 11:07 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah I see, I was mixing up ENG and GEN.


[28-Mar-22 11:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can certainly get the CBS and AST. @dasefx1 what is the status of the second RAG?

[28-Mar-22 11:10 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 We should organize a bulk shipment of your AST to Phobos so we have a good supply to pull from for this next ship


[28-Mar-22 11:12 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I ended up putting the SPF on ANTIC, but I can get the materials there from Phobos

[28-Mar-22 11:12 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also @insensless72 lets try to get some FAL on the same ship if possible


[28-Mar-22 12:52 PM] allocater#0000
actually naming the planet Antic would be funny


[28-Mar-22 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
hah, yes that is a great name


[28-Mar-22 03:33 PM] insensless72#0000
I have 60 FAL on Deimos currently


[28-Mar-22 03:36 PM] dasefx1#0000
I updated on ftl ship, I think most of items missing


[28-Mar-22 03:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
missing? you mean for the next ship?


[28-Mar-22 04:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
Yes

The SSL and  SCB will take some time,  I have to get the TIO back to Deimos and burn it painfully slow. But yes, when I have the components ill slap up a SKF and get those for you


[31-Mar-22 03:27 PM] allocater#0000
TI is pretty cheap now, so I can buy 20 for 16k if that speeds it up


[31-Mar-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we will still need the TI on this ship or the next, its good to smelt it regardless


[31-Mar-22 03:30 PM] allocater#0000
yeah if we make a permanent ship building industry it's good to have it all set up


[31-Mar-22 07:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We are making permanent ship building


[31-Mar-22 07:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I mean, we are not going to run SKF and SPF 24/7 or anything like that, but I expect that we will always have ship components in production from this point onward

[31-Mar-22 07:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Assuming we have access to WAI and BMF, we mainly need to build an AIR and WR to create a life support system


[31-Mar-22 07:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
LIS + plastics and a TCU makes the CQM which is a finished ship component.


[31-Mar-22 07:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 how many WAI do you have?


[01-Apr-22 04:18 AM] namthorn#0000
heading out to pick up some LI from my smelting outpost, do we need any for shipbuilding?


[01-Apr-22 05:20 AM] dasefx1#0000
15 WAI


[01-Apr-22 05:34 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape I filled excel FTL ship with amounts of products which I had for next ships


[01-Apr-22 01:47 PM] allocater#0000
Do we have anybody for APF stuff yet?


[01-Apr-22 01:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater this has been done by yaro in the past but it would be best if somebody else could do it long term


[01-Apr-22 01:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yaro has suggested providing him with APF inputs so he can process them without keeping track of very complicated production lines


[01-Apr-22 01:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but it hasnt happened yet 😅


[01-Apr-22 01:55 PM] allocater#0000
I can provide BWS and AAR, for RAD I have to get into ECM


[01-Apr-22 02:17 PM] allocater#0000
who does BHP/LHP?


[01-Apr-22 02:27 PM] namthorn#0000
either LM or whoever has the mats to throw down a HWP


[01-Apr-22 04:20 PM] allocater#0000
then I better get on that because it will take 2 weeks with 1 HWP 😲


[01-Apr-22 04:24 PM] namthorn#0000
there's usually 1 or 2 on deimos selling hull plates


[01-Apr-22 04:31 PM] namthorn#0000
bear in mind you get 4 per run in the HWP so it'd be less than 2 weeks with only 1 HWP, a few days at most


[01-Apr-22 04:33 PM] namthorn#0000
43/4 = 11 runs rounded up, * 7hrs per run = 77hrs


[01-Apr-22 04:33 PM] allocater#0000
ah, right


[01-Apr-22 04:33 PM] allocater#0000
I test if someone sells for 1300


[01-Apr-22 04:34 PM] namthorn#0000
possibly, I saw someone selling BHP for 1500 earlier in the week


[01-Apr-22 04:38 PM] allocater#0000
well that was quick, already fulfilled


[01-Apr-22 04:39 PM] insensless72#0000
yeah BHP can be bought easily


[01-Apr-22 04:39 PM] insensless72#0000

@allocater  I've stocked PSMs and -Ls for Shipbuilding on ANTIC. I'm heading from there to Phobos tomorrow, so I can bring some of them for, just say an amount. My ppf on phobos churns DCMs. there's currently only 4 of those.


[03-Apr-22 01:55 PM] allocater#0000
I will take:

24 PSL
16 PSM
infinite DCM 😄

the next ship for public sale will probably be another BR1 + CQM, but depending on demand we might do BR1 + CQS


[04-Apr-22 02:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in short, it is safe for you to make multiple BR1 if you are in a position to do so @allocater

@allocater your order for PSM was only for 12. I have the other 4 if you need them still.

oops, new ad up


[05-Apr-22 12:03 PM] namthorn#0000
who shall i pass TI on to? I've got 50 on Deimos.


[05-Apr-22 12:09 PM] allocater#0000
we have no one for APF, right? Or is @dasefx1 continuing doing that?


[05-Apr-22 01:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its either yaro or no APF, we might need to wait for his response


[05-Apr-22 02:23 PM] dasefx1#0000
I still have for few weeks


[05-Apr-22 02:26 PM] allocater#0000
we most need LIS, I think, to build more quarters


[05-Apr-22 02:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes LIS is tricky. let me pull up my game since im on lunch break now


[05-Apr-22 02:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000

Im going to treat all currency equal and respect the highest bid at midnight, BUT i really want bob industries to win with AIC so we dont get stuck with NCC


[05-Apr-22 02:33 PM] allocater#0000
I regularly go on NCC shopping sprees, so I can use it

should we get somebody to build up WAI industry? seems LIS needs 3 and the software chain is insane


[05-Apr-22 02:35 PM] allocater#0000
I can do BMF, but the other 3 items for LIS are insane


[05-Apr-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 updated our ship spreadsheet on April 1 saying he has 15 WAI

[05-Apr-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think this is not actually an april fools, and he has more of them by now.


[05-Apr-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This provides us a buffer time to produce some more ships while developing software


[05-Apr-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It does need to happen though, you are right @allocater


[05-Apr-22 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with a WAI and a SAR, the AIR (Air scrubber) is actually not so bad, Just a few random items.

@insensless72 is producing FLP, FC and GV on Deimos to accomodate these and a few other ship items


[05-Apr-22 02:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also Earthling has stocked some CLR items on Phobos and will give them to the war effort 🙂

[05-Apr-22 02:54 PM] allocater#0000
Yeah I can do all electronics


[05-Apr-22 02:55 PM] allocater#0000
so with WAI and APF to combine it, we should be good


[05-Apr-22 02:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you want or need any of those basic CLR items i listed, i can get them to you for free in reasonable quantities

[06-Apr-22 03:29 AM] dasefx1#0000

will you be able to make enough sensors and PCB?


[06-Apr-22 02:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or maybe it is preferable to buy these, i havent looked into it

@namthorn how quickly can you produce 4 ETC?


[06-Apr-22 02:49 PM] namthorn#0000
need a little bit of time to get the lfabs for the TNP and send a shipment of TCO & REA to griffonstone, probably late next week?


[06-Apr-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Let us know if loaned LFABs would help speed it up, but thats workable


[06-Apr-22 02:50 PM] namthorn#0000
nah its shipping bottleneck, i have the cash for the lfabs


[06-Apr-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe we could ship for you, in that case


[06-Apr-22 02:50 PM] namthorn#0000
should have the TNP up sunday if all goes to plan


[06-Apr-22 02:51 PM] namthorn#0000
but its a dayish per ETC


[06-Apr-22 02:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh, i see, this is fine then. I wont rush you 😁


[06-Apr-22 03:06 PM] namthorn#0000
though some shipping of the TCL would simplify things


[06-Apr-22 03:07 PM] namthorn#0000
if i can dump it at Nike with the EPO/PG I normally drop off that would help


[06-Apr-22 07:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano see the above discussion with Namthorn for a timeline to bring the SPF back online.


[06-Apr-22 07:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We are preparing the FAL, AST, THP, and CHA on Deimos for you to produce the NOZ + ENG as well, we should have this ready on the same time frame as the ETC


[06-Apr-22 07:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 this means you and me need to transfer the necessary AML items to Deimos and then produce 40 FAL, 4 CHA, 20 THP, 4 SFK, and 8 MFK within the next 7 days


[06-Apr-22 07:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can also bring in another shipload of FE


[06-Apr-22 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this will then go to Mark on ANTIC


[06-Apr-22 07:39 PM] insensless72#0000

[06-Apr-22 07:43 PM] insensless72#0000
I have everything but the CHA, 20 THP 3 days out though


[06-Apr-22 07:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe we could double this then, and set mark up for 2 ENG in the same time


[06-Apr-22 07:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but 1 ENG is enough if this is too difficult


[06-Apr-22 07:45 PM] insensless72#0000
its not the difficulty per say, just the time. We have to get your BOS to Deimos, im still working on the FC, GV, and THP through the welder which takes longer than I expected. 10 FLP takes 5 days


[06-Apr-22 07:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mmm, let me see if we can make that one lower priority


[06-Apr-22 07:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
is it too late to adjust those FLP recipes?


[06-Apr-22 07:48 PM] insensless72#0000
no i canceled them. I have 10 GV in the WEL now with 2 days 3hrs and 20 THP next which is 21hrs


[06-Apr-22 07:49 PM] insensless72#0000
have to have the GV for CHA


[06-Apr-22 07:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok nice. We do need 12 FLP for the APF work on Phobos, and the sheet says 60 per ship, but they are easier to get


[06-Apr-22 07:50 PM] insensless72#0000
ill que them after the 20 THP

[07-Apr-22 04:06 AM] dasefx1#0000
LIS
for WR I need 12 FLC and 1 FC
for AIR I need 1 FC. 
FFC I will produce tomorrow, as I forget transport WAI
LFE I need 6 CTF and 1 CBL as one I already have 
If CBL I need to produce I need 12 BE, 150 PG and 60 HCC shortly  on phobos as I had last LI  for few days and than I demolish ECA


[07-Apr-22 04:09 AM] dasefx1#0000
for ACS I need 2 FC and 20 THF 
for RCS I need to transport things to ant  c


[07-Apr-22 10:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 I can give you 12 BE and 150pg now


[07-Apr-22 10:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
post requests on phobos for 1 AIC. ill find the HCC for you soon, and the FC and FLC is being prepared on deimos now


[07-Apr-22 10:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape @dasefx1 What type of electronic products are needed the most for shipbuilding? I consider doing electronics on my base on Phobos.


[07-Apr-22 10:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater could also weigh in here, since he has been gradually replacing some of yaros capacity


[07-Apr-22 10:33 AM] dasefx1#0000
@bitcoin_ape when you have all I will put ads


[07-Apr-22 10:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 some of this is being prepared by insensless but i will transfer it to phobos for you


[07-Apr-22 10:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you can put all the ads now and i will figure it out


[07-Apr-22 10:34 AM] dasefx1#0000

[07-Apr-22 01:10 PM] allocater#0000
For electronics we are missing MCA for MB HD FAN. Also ECA but I am building that next. Depending on SAR need we could also build another ELP.

@dasefx1 you can request 60 HCC on phobos, I bought them at the CX, but my ECA is not up yet. price 250/u


[07-Apr-22 01:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

sure 🙂


[07-Apr-22 01:28 PM] allocater#0000
anybody want to produce 2 DEC cheaper than the 7000/u on the CX?


[07-Apr-22 01:36 PM] namthorn#0000
I can do you a couple for 5750/u. though you'll have to come get them from griffonstone as my ships are both busy atm.


[07-Apr-22 01:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I produced the last DEC on phobos, but I have been without chlorine for a while.


[07-Apr-22 01:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they changed the requirements for the HQ upgrade on me, which blocked my expansion last week.


[07-Apr-22 01:39 PM] namthorn#0000
i have some EPO on Nike you can yoink instead if you wanna make them, can give that for free


[07-Apr-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I should be able to settle this weekend and get DEC running again immediately after


[07-Apr-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, yes the EPO on Nike would speed this up


[07-Apr-22 01:41 PM] namthorn#0000
put an order up for the 300 for the 2 DEC and I can fill, also can ship some from the CX instead if someone can do ANT -> Phobos


[07-Apr-22 01:41 PM] namthorn#0000
if you need more


[07-Apr-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

the deimos welders have to make: 12 FLP and 2 FC for @dasefx1


[07-Apr-22 02:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills sounds like ELP is an easy entry point to electronics


[07-Apr-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
MCA is also needed, but it is in the middle of the production chain which makes it a bit awkward.


[07-Apr-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it requires CLR and SCA inputs


[07-Apr-22 03:50 PM] insensless72#0000

but, what if someone else would bet 4.1 mil? will we give it without auction?


[09-Apr-22 06:21 AM] namthorn#0000
4 mil is a pretty good guaranteed price imo


[09-Apr-22 08:29 AM] allocater#0000
he will bet that anyway during the next auction, so it's guaranteed either way 😄


[09-Apr-22 08:29 AM] allocater#0000
what's CQ is next, CQS?


[09-Apr-22 09:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
CQM


[09-Apr-22 09:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we are still doing @insensless72 ship first, as it is mostly built


[09-Apr-22 09:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this one is also CQS**. So we need 2 in the short term

[09-Apr-22 10:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater There is still room for me to negotiate price with Spice on this direct sale


[09-Apr-22 10:31 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have only confirmed that we are capable of building it, and that some of the requested upgrades add expense.


[09-Apr-22 10:31 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
4 million was proposed by the buyer


[09-Apr-22 10:32 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
However, I think 4 million is adequate 😄 and it is nice to have certainty on the selling aspect


[09-Apr-22 10:32 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think we are in a sellers market, but still it is time consuming. Direct sale is fast.


[09-Apr-22 10:32 AM] dasefx1#0000

who (of deimos?) wants to build CTF for ships?


[09-Apr-22 12:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 builds it for us already, I supply the tungsten


[09-Apr-22 12:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have commissioned artokun to build 60+ CF which is already in production


[09-Apr-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also Spoopy is now producing Titanium on Deimos using my ore


[09-Apr-22 12:13 PM] allocater#0000
nice, CF/CTF go now to me, since I take over LFE MFE SFE from yaro. Is there an updated chart of our supply chain?


[09-Apr-22 12:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No, we need to draft this, it would be good if you were involved


[09-Apr-22 12:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I knew we needed to do this, but things are still in motion and I wasnt sure exactly how it would shake out. Now we have some more certainty

Since we already have sharing permissions on this document, Let us duplicate the main sheet as a new tab on the same document and then make adjustments for user names, material assignments, and also quantities for the altered recipes


[09-Apr-22 12:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
QCR instead of RCT, etc. It will be minor adjustments, the main components are the same.


[09-Apr-22 12:19 PM] allocater#0000
we can make a view of all components/goods, then we can always use it no matter what ship we build, we always know where some item is coming from

[13-Apr-22 06:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 these 4 CHA will build your Standard STL Engine (ENG)

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Apr-22 07:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In total, to make 1 ENG you need to provide @spatial_piano  the following:
```
4 CHA (1 per NOZ)
10 AST
40 FAL (10 per NOZ)
20 THP (5 per BFP)```


[13-Apr-22 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is enough to make 4 NOZ and 4 BFP, with some other basic materials

@insensless72 in additon to DLRs list I need 10 more AST for the reactor.

Just so I have this right before I send the ship:
4 CHA
20 AST
20 THP
40 FAL


[14-Apr-22 03:24 PM] insensless72#0000
I can potentially bring more FAL, I have 180 ready


[14-Apr-22 03:39 PM] insensless72#0000
also 24 FLP I believe


[14-Apr-22 04:01 PM] insensless72#0000

@allocater ill be receiving 60 CF tomorrow on Deimos if I can manage my inventory properly


[15-Apr-22 01:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This will need to be moved to Phobos for your clean rooms if i remember right. I dont currently have a ship organized but we can figure that out


[15-Apr-22 02:22 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, I have a STO on Deimos. So please, you can deliver the AL.

update:

CQS - LIS is on the way, production start in ~10h
ENG - no idea, am not involved there
LFE - in production
RCT - blocked because 20 BGO are to heavy for Mark's base 😄


[22-Apr-22 11:39 AM] allocater#0000
then we are finished, right? @bitcoin_ape


[22-Apr-22 11:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think so, i anticipated the last of this construction would be ready by monday


[22-Apr-22 11:42 AM] insensless72#0000
I still have the 4 BFR on Hephaestus as well for next round

[23-Apr-22 02:58 AM] allocater#0000
@bitcoin_ape are we shipping in BRO or should I produce it onsight?


[23-Apr-22 04:00 AM] yang_mills#0000
I usually deliver the LHP to @bitcoin_ape and don't stock them on my base. Perhaps he still has some left.


[23-Apr-22 04:03 AM] allocater#0000
yeah I don't know if we deliver 94 as part of the package, if yes, we need to produce them


[23-Apr-22 04:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape should tell how many does he have left in stock.


[23-Apr-22 06:37 AM] insensless72#0000
@Hephaestus All missing requirements are listed. I will have 13 extra LHP to dedicate to the next ship. I also think I have all the components ready to roll for the next ENG


[23-Apr-22 06:37 AM] insensless72#0000
Whatever is in the grey box on the sheet


[23-Apr-22 06:38 AM] insensless72#0000

then you can accept the ad for it, I will collect all because I am the only one with STO atm


[23-Apr-22 06:51 AM] insensless72#0000
I can go ahead and bring alloys with me on one ship, how many are needed?


[23-Apr-22 06:54 AM] insensless72#0000
Headed to Hephaestus, all intended for next ship

I have everything I need, maybe the engine stuff needs it, but @spatial_piano will tell us.

if not you can always preproduce packages of 10 FET, 28 AST

[23-Apr-22 06:59 AM] insensless72#0000
We might need update the sheet on who is producing what out of the FS since we both have one dedicated to ships now


[23-Apr-22 07:01 AM] allocater#0000
yeah so far I just produce connectors for capacitors


[23-Apr-22 07:02 AM] allocater#0000
is the 25 BRO already somewhere?


[23-Apr-22 07:03 AM] insensless72#0000
Yes, I have it on Deimos

{Reactions}
🥳 

[23-Apr-22 07:24 AM] insensless72#0000
I also have 40 BGO for electronics


[23-Apr-22 07:26 AM] allocater#0000
sure I take it, but it's so heavy it probably makes sense I produce it on sight. Are you moving gold ANT->Deimos->ANT?


[23-Apr-22 07:27 AM] allocater#0000
or you turn it into connectors before moving


[23-Apr-22 10:10 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BER and BOR secured, which means plenty of BOS and BE in the near future

next: scaling up LI @namthorn 😄


[23-Apr-22 10:13 AM] namthorn#0000
in progress


[23-Apr-22 10:13 AM] allocater#0000
ECA can burn 30LI+30BE per day into money


[23-Apr-22 10:13 AM] namthorn#0000
will be doubling output once insenseless is done with the HSEs


[23-Apr-22 10:14 AM] namthorn#0000
will make more TCS too once the next set of 4 ETC is done


[23-Apr-22 10:16 AM] allocater#0000
BE burns into 4500 AIC
LI burns into 1000 AIC


[23-Apr-22 10:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can do a max of 30 BE per 26 hours, but that is neglecting BOS and W which also demand AML time for each ship


[23-Apr-22 10:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also, we need to make THP which will use significant amounts of BE.


[23-Apr-22 10:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In short, I think AML time is still a hard limit to consider


[23-Apr-22 10:52 AM] allocater#0000
yeah I don't expect full ECA time anytime soon. It will also run into HCC trouble (150 per day)

How many LHP do we miss?


[24-Apr-22 10:54 AM] allocater#0000
61


[24-Apr-22 10:54 AM] yang_mills#0000
Does it take into account the 20 LHP that I delivered to @bitcoin_ape a few days ago?


[24-Apr-22 10:55 AM] allocater#0000
if there are still some floating around, they should speak up 😄


[24-Apr-22 10:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
I think it was yesterday. I delivered 20 LHP.


[24-Apr-22 10:57 AM] yang_mills#0000
Is this to finish a ship?


[24-Apr-22 10:57 AM] allocater#0000
nah, still plenty missing


[24-Apr-22 10:58 AM] yang_mills#0000
What is it for?


[24-Apr-22 10:58 AM] allocater#0000
the second pinned ship in this channel


[24-Apr-22 11:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills you have been producing LHP for insensless and for the spice ship. insensless is done, now we are accumulating LHP for the spice build


[24-Apr-22 11:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the 20 you delivered recently are going to the spice build, but are still on Deimos.


[24-Apr-22 11:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
What is spice build?


[24-Apr-22 11:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Spice is a player in game who is paying 4m NCC for our next ship, built to their specifications


[24-Apr-22 11:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the blueprint is pinned in here somewhere


[24-Apr-22 11:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
So you need me to produce 61 more LHP?


[24-Apr-22 11:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No. The spice ship build requires 94 LHP, of which I already have 60 LHP


[24-Apr-22 11:06 AM] allocater#0000
I have 33


[24-Apr-22 11:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I plan to offer 120 total at the time of sale


[24-Apr-22 11:06 AM] allocater#0000
so 1 more!


[24-Apr-22 11:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, then we are heavy on LHP 🙂 this is okay


[24-Apr-22 11:07 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i wasnt aware of these 33 though, or at least i had forgotten haha


[24-Apr-22 11:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. Just tell me how many LHP do you miss to finish the ship. I would like to produce some BHP after that.

{Reactions}

[24-Apr-22 11:07 AM] allocater#0000
I also don't know where the 33 come from 😄


[24-Apr-22 11:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
are they somehow for insensless? make sure he has all the LHP he is expecting


[24-Apr-22 11:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i thought he had it all in inventory, though


[24-Apr-22 11:08 AM] allocater#0000
@insensless72 ☝


[24-Apr-22 03:50 PM] insensless72#0000
I'm good on LHP. I have 67/67 ready on Deimos


[24-Apr-22 03:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills this means we only need 120-33-60 = 27 LHP to have the full 120 for spice


[25-Apr-22 08:17 AM] rune_242#0000
can i help with the ship building?


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@rune_242  You already have been by supplying aluminum on deimos 🙂


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
anything specific you had in mind?


[25-Apr-22 10:45 AM] rune_242#0000
seems like you need SSC


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea welder time can be a bit tight, do you already have a welder?


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] rune_242#0000
not yet


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
these consume metal extremely fast


[25-Apr-22 10:46 AM] rune_242#0000
but I can build one in 2 days


[25-Apr-22 10:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Lets consider some other options first before rushing into another welder. ill think about this today and allow allocater and insensless to chime in


[25-Apr-22 10:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they might be aware of some logistics or supply problem in our shipbuilding chain


[25-Apr-22 11:44 AM] allocater#0000
seems all is in the pipeline and about to come in. Except the fate of the 128 SSC and ~~FFC~~ is unknown

best time to completion is 7 days, contraints by ACS/RCS->RAG->QCR chain. So SSC can come in under 7 days, they would not delay it.


[25-Apr-22 11:46 AM] allocater#0000
@dasefx1 if you can slot in one RCS, we can shorten that time by 2 days, you can request all inputs


[25-Apr-22 12:28 PM] allocater#0000
nvm FFC is already done

[25-Apr-22 03:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Do you think you can hack it in 3 weeks if we can supply 6 CHA, 60 FAL and the THF?


[25-Apr-22 03:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
some other random fuel pump welder items


[25-Apr-22 03:21 PM] allocater#0000
https://prun.plexucra.de/tree/ put in FSE 460000 see if the prices look good.


[25-Apr-22 03:22 PM] allocater#0000
I can give SAR/ACS


[25-Apr-22 03:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
FSE production takes 5 days with the 6 Nozzles included, and 1 day for shipping to Deimos. If I can get all the items for it in 2 weeks at most, I can do it. There's of course Spices FSE that needs to be done as well, so I'm not sure how that will fit in.


[25-Apr-22 03:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Do you think the ad will stay?


[25-Apr-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Spice FSE must take priority if we are going to accept this standalone offer


[25-Apr-22 03:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
QCR also


[25-Apr-22 03:32 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Right. So I'd need another 5 days for his FSE, and 3-4 days for QCR.


[25-Apr-22 07:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72
@spatial_piano 

I can supply the BOS and THF within 4 days including shipping.

Insensless told me today that his welder has some spare capacity and is sometimes idle.

Now we need to confirm that Insensless can produce the 6 GV -> 6 CHA and 60 FAL and ship Deimos -> Hephaestus, all within 10 days.

If yes, this means we should accept the 460k FSE contract.


[25-Apr-22 07:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If we can pull this off in time for the spice LCB build, We will split it evenly at 115k each, in addition to our individual payouts for the 4m NCC ship sale.


[25-Apr-22 08:22 PM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape I can produce 6 GV and 6 CHA and 40 FAL within 4 days with nothing queued. With that being said I always have FAL in stock


[25-Apr-22 08:23 PM] insensless72#0000
6 GV and 6 CHA takes 101hrs so thats 4.20 (😂 ) days production time

aaaah


[26-Apr-22 01:01 PM] rune_242#0000
I see


[26-Apr-22 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we have flexible timeline on those, but insensless already had like 30 SSC leftover and some NFI from his ship


[26-Apr-22 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so its easy to do this


[26-Apr-22 03:54 PM] emperyan11#0000
If I wanted to get in on the shipbuilder  (supplier) game what would be the best MAT to produce on Deimos?


[26-Apr-22 03:55 PM] rune_242#0000
AL


[26-Apr-22 03:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
indeed, AL. possibly glass furnace as well depending on where the ship market moves


[26-Apr-22 03:57 PM] rune_242#0000
build a glass furnace 6h ago


[26-Apr-22 03:59 PM] yang_mills#0000
By the way, I have a GF on Deimos. For now it is mostly used to produce TUB for POPI and some GL for the PP2. If you need something more useful, I could do that instead.


[26-Apr-22 03:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
TUB is great, any glass products imported to Nike are also valuable


[26-Apr-22 04:00 PM] rune_242#0000
I think we do exactly the same bary😅


[26-Apr-22 04:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am just learning now that there is some market for glass engine slow ships, we could look into this


[26-Apr-22 04:00 PM] namthorn#0000
am falling over gl atm


[26-Apr-22 04:01 PM] namthorn#0000
if you want GENs made, just need the GV and LFP


[26-Apr-22 04:01 PM] namthorn#0000
rest i can do


[26-Apr-22 04:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
LFPs are weird. Mark does these already for the FSEs, but limited amounts. Maybe 12 LFP total so far


[26-Apr-22 04:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont know if that is scalable without new PPFs


[26-Apr-22 04:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also I dont even know how many glass ships we could sell. Would need to do some ~~all caps advertising~~ market research


[26-Apr-22 04:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
A glass ship is slower than light  only, isn't it?


[26-Apr-22 04:06 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, gen is slower than a standard engine


[26-Apr-22 04:06 PM] namthorn#0000
but its much cheaper


[26-Apr-22 04:07 PM] namthorn#0000
oh, STL only yea that too


[26-Apr-22 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you could put a glass engine on an FTL ship but it sounds like a waste really


[26-Apr-22 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they are perfect for cheap, non FTL ships


[26-Apr-22 04:07 PM] namthorn#0000
not worth when youre shellingout millions for the FTL capability already yea


[26-Apr-22 04:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I've only made the 6 LFP I need for the first FSE. I need thermo fluid to make more.


[26-Apr-22 04:16 PM] namthorn#0000
put up an ad for 1 on heph for however many you need, i've got 230 in a war there

[27-Apr-22 09:01 PM] allocater#0000
If we have that much demand, we can build another APF to speed it up. Might also be viable to get a corp PP4 for the a-fabs.


[28-Apr-22 03:50 AM] namthorn#0000
will get started on some more RG for GENs


[28-Apr-22 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater @namthorn agreed on all points


[28-Apr-22 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
another APF is warranted


[28-Apr-22 12:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i have been passively buying all PP4 output from our very own earthling, and using it to build our ship infrastructure to date


[28-Apr-22 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
however i still buy AFABs on the market, and would like to move it internal


[28-Apr-22 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so a PP4 on nike is now what we need


[28-Apr-22 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also NR production on griffonstone, with shipment to nike


[28-Apr-22 02:47 PM] namthorn#0000
will see about picking up some NCS on my next supply run


[28-Apr-22 09:20 PM] domicius#0000
I make that


[28-Apr-22 09:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater how soon do you want the new APF?


[29-Apr-22 01:30 AM] allocater#0000
I would say it can wait for the corp PP4 to produce it, or at least for the ship income to be carefully converted to a-fabs, because the next ship APF duties are done in 8d. Only for the next next ships it will increase to ~13d because NV1 reserves are gone by then.


[29-Apr-22 12:17 PM] allocater#0000
final countdown:

RAG 2d8h
shipping ~3h
QCR  3d(?)

that's also the timer for the 128 SSC to arrive 😏


[29-Apr-22 12:33 PM] insensless72#0000
I have 150 SSC on Deimos, can anyone help me get it to Heph?


[29-Apr-22 12:38 PM] namthorn#0000

[29-Apr-22 09:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
QCR, FSE, LCB appears to be the popular choice


[29-Apr-22 09:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There was another dude trying to bid low on a smaller ship, but at this point I think we should focus on making more like the one we are finishing this weekend

8.5 days. 85h for 6 NOZ, 28 for FSE, 85 for QCR (+7 h to finish the BHP I was making during downtime.) I'm running the SPF with Engineers only so with basic consumables my efficiency is 84%. Wit luxuries I could get it to 106%, but even then it's a week.

{Reactions}
😲 

[30-Apr-22 07:24 AM] allocater#0000
time for another SPF? 😄


[30-Apr-22 07:25 AM] allocater#0000
guess next time we should prioritize the CHA delivery first so the NOZ get out of the way


[30-Apr-22 07:25 AM] spatial_piano#0000
No, time to double everythinge else than the SPF


[30-Apr-22 07:27 AM] allocater#0000
or on what input was the SPF stuck most of the time?


[30-Apr-22 07:28 AM] insensless72#0000
noted, I will arrange getting 60 BOS from DLR and start producing 6 more CHA asap

{Reactions}
🥳 

[30-Apr-22 07:29 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Much obliged.


[30-Apr-22 07:36 AM] spatial_piano#0000
NOZ would be a good thing to produce to storage, since both ENG and FSE need those. Higher level engines use different nozzles, but they also need ferrotitaniium or WAL and wont be in as high of demand.

{Reactions}
👍 

[30-Apr-22 07:39 AM] allocater#0000
request engineer luxuries, since SPF is now the bottle neck we will speed it up


[30-Apr-22 07:41 AM] allocater#0000
So 1 VG and 4 GIN I guess


[30-Apr-22 08:13 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Will I have something to produce after spice ship is done? SPF is empty lot of the time so I don't see any  reason to increase the speed (unless the customer is paying extra for speed.) Even if I take the Extra FSE job  I can get that done within 14 days at this pace.


[30-Apr-22 08:15 AM] allocater#0000
I mean it will only speed up for that 1 unit of VG+GIN, which I have laying around on heph anyway. Also we will immediately build the next ship so in 7d you should have the next batch of CHA to start with that.


[30-Apr-22 08:16 AM] allocater#0000
then SPF can slow down again since it can do everything for a ship in under 10d


[30-Apr-22 08:16 AM] allocater#0000
which would be the goal


[30-Apr-22 08:43 AM] allocater#0000
there is also to consider that SPF is now 1 week out of sync with all other production and has to make that up over time


[30-Apr-22 08:53 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I'd rather have it that way. Even if everything else is running at 10d/ship pace SPF will catch up in 4-5 ships. Is everything else running at 10d/ship?


[30-Apr-22 08:56 AM] allocater#0000
we would have to check that 😅


[30-Apr-22 08:58 AM] allocater#0000
if we always speed up the bottleneck, we should get there eventually 😄


[30-Apr-22 09:04 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. We should have some sort of capacity tracker. It would be easier to tell where the bottleneck is and what is the accurate throughput.


[30-Apr-22 09:05 AM] allocater#0000
everyone could check all the items they are supposed to make here again: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HtR4S65W8Ja8X60kUJdfnnUGwG_ZysCPM4XsQSQKIng/edit#gid=0 - tree tab

[30-Apr-22 08:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
however the ASM and smelting capacity is pretty epic at this point. I suspect AML is the bottleneck


[30-Apr-22 09:13 PM] insensless72#0000
Without having touched the calculator 😉 , unless I have alloys stockpiled the alloys will take longer than 10 days


[30-Apr-22 09:13 PM] insensless72#0000
that being said I keep at least 100-200 on hand ready for the next ship


[30-Apr-22 09:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You could get engineers


[30-Apr-22 09:14 PM] insensless72#0000

If anyone wants to recommend some organizational changes with how we approach the ship build process, im all ears. At first my own/yaro's direct involvement was necessary, but we are past that by now I think. Weve got it mostly figured out


[12-May-22 01:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also i have less time, i prefer to delegate some of these more difficult items

Also there is~~ no~~ limited accounting.. @spatial_piano got closest to it with the cost estimate spreadsheet, but it is not trivial


[12-May-22 01:39 PM] allocater#0000
I think everything runs smoothly. We can just think about increasing speed, but not sure which part would be the most challenging to ramp up, maybe still software.


[12-May-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For me, I think BOS is the most difficult to make.


[12-May-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i notice delays coming from here pretty often, because it needs to undergo time consuming produciton on Phobos, then Deimos, and then Hephaestus, with several possible shipping delays.


[12-May-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is for FSE/ENG


[12-May-22 01:43 PM] namthorn#0000
what's the BOS bottleneck?


[12-May-22 01:43 PM] namthorn#0000
metal supply?


[12-May-22 01:44 PM] allocater#0000
we could cut out deimos and wel on heph, also 1 more AML? we just need 1 ABH


[12-May-22 01:44 PM] namthorn#0000
I do have a sizeable BER stock on SE-648b you could turn into metals for BOS pretty quick


[12-May-22 01:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats the general method, although i have been buying BER somewhat randomly as I can find it. it would be nice to have a steady supply


[12-May-22 01:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
1 AML at 100% eff. can produce the BOS for an FSE in 7.5 days


[12-May-22 01:46 PM] namthorn#0000
got 5 extractors going, about 50 BER a day

{Reactions}
🪨 ⚙️ 

[12-May-22 01:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
then you have welder and SPF time after that


[12-May-22 01:47 PM] allocater#0000
with BER going to phobos the interstellar shipping would be done if the WEL is done in system on heph, adding 1 more SPF should also be easy with yaro's inheritance


[12-May-22 01:49 PM] namthorn#0000
I'll head out on that route soon as I send the LFPs to deimos.


[12-May-22 01:50 PM] namthorn#0000
got another shipload in stock if anyone wants to assist


[12-May-22 01:53 PM] allocater#0000
moving BOS out of ANT and then back in to ANT seems indeed suboptimal. Let's build WEL on heph.


[12-May-22 01:54 PM] namthorn#0000
that makes sense, can utilise your glass ship more that way

[12-May-22 02:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@rune_242 you have recently built a WEL on Deimos for ship work.


[12-May-22 02:14 PM] rune_242#0000
yes


[12-May-22 02:18 PM] allocater#0000
WEL could also be on phobos, either the BOS is shipped or the CHA


[12-May-22 02:35 PM] allocater#0000
we could also use another SCA, also either on heph or phobos


[12-May-22 02:38 PM] allocater#0000

we can still queue more jobs from GDP since they are looking for multiple ships of different types

besides the engines, we need just 80 LHP more on heph and both are basically complete

@yang_mills Could you use some help making LHP?


[14-May-22 10:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
I don't understand. Do we need more LHP?


[14-May-22 10:36 AM] allocater#0000
if the GDP ships don't need LHP, then ~50 for the next ship, generally would be good to always have ~100 in storage


[14-May-22 10:38 AM] yang_mills#0000
Right now I produce RHP. But can switch to LHP afterwards. Just need to know how much is needed. @bitcoin_ape, what do we have in reserve?


[14-May-22 10:39 AM] allocater#0000
I only know of the 59 at the shipyard.

Ok. Right now I alternate RHP and BHP.


[14-May-22 04:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We were hitting inventory/overproduction issues on LHP so i asked yang to switch to RHP which is slower and uses titanium


[14-May-22 04:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BHP have normal market demand so those are also good

I could make CHA if I have BOS


[17-May-22 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
you will get the BOS on phobos, and the CHA go then to Heph, which you can post shipping contract for. We just want to keep the step inside ANT1


[17-May-22 11:11 AM] rune_242#0000
sure


[17-May-22 11:11 AM] allocater#0000
ship component transfers started, WAR out of space again. I always forget to upgrade it 😄


[17-May-22 11:11 AM] rune_242#0000
what planet?


[17-May-22 11:12 AM] allocater#0000
heph WAR is out of space

BOS to CHA you can do on  phobos or heph


[17-May-22 11:13 AM] rune_242#0000
can I have some?


[17-May-22 11:14 AM] allocater#0000
make an ad for 10 BOS on phobos, and either DLR or me will fill it, whoever gets 10 first 😄


[17-May-22 11:15 AM] rune_242#0000
Can I have more than 10?


[17-May-22 11:15 AM] rune_242#0000
my welder is on deimos


[17-May-22 11:15 AM] rune_242#0000
I would like 200 or so


[17-May-22 11:16 AM] rune_242#0000
make a bunch of CHA


[17-May-22 11:16 AM] rune_242#0000
and ship them back


[17-May-22 11:18 AM] allocater#0000
but that's too much shipping, first out of ANT1 then back to ANT1, you sure? I don't think we have much BOS it's one of the current ship building bottlenecks


[17-May-22 11:18 AM] rune_242#0000
If the ship is almost full then it's no problem


[17-May-22 11:18 AM] allocater#0000
always waiting for 60 and shipping it around leads to delays


[17-May-22 11:19 AM] allocater#0000
it's like a just-in-time supply chain 😄


[17-May-22 11:19 AM] allocater#0000
10 BOS go out -> 1 CHA -> keep SPF alive


[17-May-22 11:20 AM] allocater#0000
that's why we want to keep it in 1 system

@bitcoin_ape Are they looking for this extra MCB when they purchase the ship or whenever? You can let them know its ready


[18-May-22 07:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Glass ship, not the FTL one


[18-May-22 07:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
he didnt make a decision in time, but i expect we will still sell the glass ship with the MCB


[18-May-22 07:04 PM] insensless72#0000
Ahh, I thought they were looking for an extra MCB separately


[19-May-22 05:36 AM] namthorn#0000
GEN is at heph. I think we're good to hand everything over now?

[19-May-22 10:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes i think so, ill contact GDP again today. I am not sure if mark has them right now, but it would be nice to bring some fuel pumps back to deimos if possible


[19-May-22 10:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[19-May-22 10:44 AM] namthorn#0000
yea absolutely, sent ship to ANT to pick up stuff but can come back to transport some LFPs back over.


[19-May-22 10:45 AM] namthorn#0000
got @rune_242 churning out some more GVs too so should be able to keep making GENs if we can keep trickling in the LFPs

basically try to outrun markymark on the SPF


[20-May-22 01:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also to remain competitive, we should consider opening that other spacecraft component building, the name of which escapes me

@allocater @insensless72 rubicate backed out of the ship build and said they would rather go with supernova foundries (SNF)


[23-May-22 07:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is the first instance of competition hitting us. However I know we can go cheaper than SNF currently can. Rubicate backed out at my quote of 4.8


[23-May-22 07:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
basically they can get the same ship at the same price, close to home, with existing business partners


[23-May-22 07:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If our build timeline was faster, or my price quote 200k lower, I think it would have been another booking


[23-May-22 07:43 PM] insensless72#0000
we can float the 4.5 cost right?


[23-May-22 07:43 PM] insensless72#0000
Backing it down from 4.8 to 4.5 could be a regular price


[23-May-22 07:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea. I still want to go up. Lets go 4.6m for our repeat customer GDP

240 AL for the 80

best I can do is 120 or my production is at risk, also bought it at 440

[31-May-22 02:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Before the aluminum crunch it would have been me. Now my metal trust has gone mostly defunct and the LHP are source direct from @yang_mills and @insensless72


[01-Jun-22 02:42 AM] allocater#0000
How much LHP are we making per day? I think we should aim for 20/day for the goal of ship every 5 days.


[01-Jun-22 06:29 AM] insensless72#0000
With a steady stream of AL we could make 40 per day split between Yang and I, thats 120 AL per day though


[01-Jun-22 11:12 AM] allocater#0000
I am sure we can do 60 AL per day

@allocater the most notable upgrades here are the HTE, HYR, and AGS


[01-Jun-22 07:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 this means about 150 WAL. Which I know will take a long time to produce


[01-Jun-22 08:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also, 38 tungsten... That is about 19 AML-days. 7 days minimum fo rme


[01-Jun-22 08:19 PM] insensless72#0000
Youre looking at 14 days 6hrs production time right there


[01-Jun-22 08:19 PM] insensless72#0000
I can divide it between 4 ASMs though obviously this is still hypothetical


[01-Jun-22 08:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Can you show the new production order, as if you were going to queue WAL on one of your ASM?


[01-Jun-22 08:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I know you need to produce other things, and going full blast on WAL isnt necessarily a good idea.


[01-Jun-22 08:31 PM] insensless72#0000
can you join stream?


[01-Jun-22 08:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
42 WAL per day is the max, and that is with 100% of our current ASM output.

[04-Jun-22 06:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
my inventory is full. I think @allocater


[04-Jun-22 11:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK here is the current situation with the 500/500 glass build, which I have already contacted you each about separately.

MarkyMark will be delivering 10 LFP (fuel pumps) to Insensless on Hephaestus


[04-Jun-22 11:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72  needs to get 4 of these LFP on a priority flight to @namthorn for construction of a GEN.


[04-Jun-22 11:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn will then put this GEN on the next flight to Hephaestus, where we can then sell the completed ship for 600k


[04-Jun-22 11:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The buyer has been informed of the delay, but not the length of the delay.. It depends on our speed with the last minute shipments


[05-Jun-22 01:31 AM] allocater#0000
ad up


[05-Jun-22 06:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
@allocater @bitcoin_ape I also want to be paid for the LHP. I used 120 of my own AL and 5 of my own HE. Plus the HWP time. I ask 300 x 120 + 5 x 120 + 40 x 600 = 60 600 AIC. Don't charge shipping because it has been done in Tayra.


[05-Jun-22 06:37 AM] namthorn#0000
roger that, I can hold a ship on deimos to courier this back to heph. It's a 19.5 hr build so depending on when the parts arrive I could get it delivered to the shipyard within 24hrs


[05-Jun-22 06:38 AM] allocater#0000
sell 1 DW for that somewhere, @bitcoin_ape will accept it


[05-Jun-22 07:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape Posted an ad on Phobos.


[05-Jun-22 07:55 AM] insensless72#0000
I have a ship screaming towards Heph now, arriving in 5 hrs. As soon as I get the LFPs Ill turn it back towards Deimos


[05-Jun-22 08:12 AM] insensless72#0000
@yang_mills @rune_242 Im adding 2 STO to Heph. As we bring LHP and SSC message me and ill store them


[05-Jun-22 02:24 PM] yang_mills#0000
I will give 40 LHP to @allocater.


[05-Jun-22 03:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 I have 40 RHP and 440 SSC on Hephaestus for you to store


[05-Jun-22 03:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its over 900t


[05-Jun-22 03:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will hold an additional 40 SSC for the 500/500 STL buyer.


[05-Jun-22 03:31 PM] allocater#0000
I have already accepted that SSC ad and have 300 SSC in store


[05-Jun-22 03:33 PM] allocater#0000
nvm apparently SSC was not among the ads


[05-Jun-22 03:56 PM] insensless72#0000
My 2nd ship is 3hrs off Heph with the mats for the 2 STO, when those are up I will accept. until then my initial 1500 is maxed out


[05-Jun-22 04:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
Delivered 40 LHP to @allocater

you mean like fuel? I am sure it will eat a lot of fuel and I will create ads as needed

I mean the actual running - picking up ads, piloting etc


[06-Jun-22 03:50 AM] allocater#0000

how did you manage a lifetime supply?


[06-Jun-22 12:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
now that i think of it, it is not that much… How many Hyper reactors could we make realistically? Not many


[06-Jun-22 12:34 PM] namthorn#0000
bought 100 off some guy, 100 LES = 1000 ES = 1000 EES = 250 FIR = 125 HYR. Pretty much a  lifetime supply for shipbuilding xD


[06-Jun-22 12:35 PM] namthorn#0000
wil also take like 200d to process it all


[06-Jun-22 12:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea I would be amazed if we even made 10 HYR. better start making gin lol


[06-Jun-22 12:36 PM] namthorn#0000

@namthorn @insensless72 buyer is asking for a timeline on the GEN delivery to hephaestus.

[07-Jun-22 12:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn @insensless72 
@allocater 

You are the (currently) unpaid parties for this build. No WAI for this one


[07-Jun-22 12:42 PM] allocater#0000
how much?


[07-Jun-22 12:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I actually dont have a good answer for this. We have a pretty stable/fair payout share for the 2k ship sales


[07-Jun-22 12:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In the past I have paid 150-175k for GEN work


[07-Jun-22 12:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is 25-29% cut from 600, which seems on par


[07-Jun-22 12:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am in for 75k on LHP and SSC for this build (1500/LHP and 250/SSC)


[07-Jun-22 12:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Plus the 2 DEC valued @6k brings me to 87k down. I am happy to take 100k here as I have barely done any real production, mostly organizational work


[07-Jun-22 12:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So. If @namthorn and myself are taking 275k combined, that leaves 335k for you two


[07-Jun-22 01:15 PM] allocater#0000
ad up for 170k on heph


[07-Jun-22 01:17 PM] insensless72#0000
ad up for 165k on Heph


[07-Jun-22 01:35 PM] namthorn#0000
the GEN should be discounted. Both the GNZ and LFPs were supplied


[07-Jun-22 01:37 PM] namthorn#0000
i only provided 50 NG, 10 THF and a MFK towards this one


[07-Jun-22 01:38 PM] namthorn#0000
so ~20k in total including the GF time


[07-Jun-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ok, thanks for the reminder here, these GNZ and LFP were from the bank/inheritance.


[07-Jun-22 01:41 PM] namthorn#0000
yep, GNZ is really the bulk of the GF work. 40 RG 1 TI and 1 GV per and you need 4 for a GEN


[07-Jun-22 01:41 PM] namthorn#0000
as well as like, 2 days of time to make each GNZ xD


[07-Jun-22 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe your glass work has paid off!


[07-Jun-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn lets call it 40k, the difference goes back to the bank


[07-Jun-22 01:42 PM] namthorn#0000
sure


[07-Jun-22 01:42 PM] namthorn#0000
we have any other STL orders btw? i have mats for another 4 GNZs


[07-Jun-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No live orders but these seem like a common request lately


[07-Jun-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you build a GEN ill buy it up front and move it to hephaestus. no rush

As opposed to h/w - hardware 😀


[09-Jun-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
all the FTL ships require WAI. minimum of 3, but we are frequently going with 6+

@domicius do you want help with some of this software stuff? I want to build another software building to help out - maybe some inputs? I could build a SD to make BAI/MLI then make NN at my SE (already built)


[10-Jun-22 02:04 AM] allocater#0000
that would be great, we need 30% more software production


[10-Jun-22 02:21 AM] domicius#0000

what is the price of a glass ship?


[10-Jun-22 10:33 AM] allocater#0000
600k


[10-Jun-22 04:35 PM] dersix#0000
what exactly are you lacking right now, WAI or SNM ?


[11-Jun-22 01:52 AM] allocater#0000
we could use 2-3 more WAI per week. The goal package is every 5 days:

6 WAI
2 DA
1 OS
1 SNM


[11-Jun-22 12:22 PM] dersix#0000
ok, I'm adding at least one SL (SE I've plenty already there) and enough SD make the necessary inputs for the NN


[11-Jun-22 12:23 PM] dersix#0000
in case someone could supply additional  BAI/MLI there's potential for even more WAI 🙂


[11-Jun-22 12:42 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm in the process of building an SD so I can provide some of these inputs once I'm up and running. If you want to take care of the SL I can make/supply the BAI/MLI?


[11-Jun-22 12:42 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm assuming you're building it on Phobos right?

it will take a bit as I first have to upgrade HQ for additional permits, I'm aiming at ~1 week time to have it set up


[11-Jun-22 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In light of this, I will need to adjust the way that we pay for WAI and ship software in general.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Jun-22 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I propose the following price structure on Phobos:

```WAI = 80k
SNM = 120k
OS = 40k
DA = 30k```


[11-Jun-22 12:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for our common ship build, we require:

1 OS
1 SNM
2 DA
6 WAI

Which totals 700k AIC


[11-Jun-22 03:49 PM] dersix#0000
on another topic, how long takes a glass ship ? 🙂


[11-Jun-22 03:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
not sure about the timing. if we have a GEN ready it could be done inside of 4 days including shipping


[11-Jun-22 03:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
basically comes down to CQT and some quick metal work on deimos, then shipping GEN + SCB + SSL from deimos to heph


[11-Jun-22 03:59 PM] dersix#0000
cash wise that fits into my schedule and it will release some pressure from my FTL ships so I would like to go for a first glass ship in ANT-I (2 more to follow pretty soon)


[11-Jun-22 05:05 PM] namthorn#0000
GEN takes a while from scratch. 160 RG and 50 NG take a fair while to make from SIO + PG + NCS


[11-Jun-22 05:06 PM] namthorn#0000
~230 hrs just for the GL


[11-Jun-22 05:06 PM] namthorn#0000
split up over however many GFs are running in parallel


[12-Jun-22 02:00 AM] allocater#0000
STL project created. From ANT1 side all parts are ready in 4d, then it just depends on the GEN time


[13-Jun-22 09:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater there are 422 BER on the market which can be had for ~146k AIC total


[13-Jun-22 09:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If we call this a materials cost of 700 AIC per BE manufactured, and ignore the value of the AL/SI for convenience (obviously we know what to do with these items). It is still a good cost basis for our shipbuilding production tree.


[13-Jun-22 09:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think I should buy the whole thing out and get a bulk shipment to Phobos


[13-Jun-22 09:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or wherever the AML victim is located


[14-Jun-22 01:35 AM] allocater#0000
buying everything might encourage price hikes. I have been slowbuying with the 250 offer and accumulated a stockpile of 800 BER.


[14-Jun-22 03:24 AM] namthorn#0000

for the engines, is it just the SPF time or all the products in the chain ? 🙂


[18-Jun-22 10:28 AM] insensless72#0000
Its the SPF time, mainly because Im waiting on engineers. I only have 46/100 so production time is half of what it will be

Yeah, the gov agreed to run an engineer program so now its just a waiting game


[18-Jun-22 10:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also with mark, we had stabilized, rolling production. Insensless had to start fresh with no workers, so we lost a week or two of engine production in there


[18-Jun-22 10:30 AM] allocater#0000
in inputs we are at 3 FSE I think, SPF just needs to chew through it

[18-Jun-22 10:33 AM] dersix#0000
I've a small 3*SE setup there, I had that one while waiting on a free plot on phobos


[18-Jun-22 10:34 AM] allocater#0000
I think we can wait for normal ENG ramp up, should be in 5 days


[18-Jun-22 12:20 PM] yang_mills#0000
Right now I have 20 LHP on Deimos and 20 more are being produced.


[18-Jun-22 12:21 PM] yang_mills#0000
I can ship the plates on Tayra. It arrives on Deimos in 26h.

[18-Jun-22 04:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So, here is my plan for the next 4 ships that we build. The first ship is the one that is ready first.


[18-Jun-22 04:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
1. Sell for 4.7mil
2. Sell for 4.7+
3. build in corp
4. build in corp


[18-Jun-22 04:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in the mean time, insensless, allocater, namthorn and myself will build up the most difficult builk materials for the hyper-power, advanced engine ship


[18-Jun-22 04:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
by the time we are ready to actually build these hyper reactors, we will have added 2 ships to our fleet, and over 9 million credits revenue

Sea of Dirac is a strange case, though. He is one of the few remaining players who is older than me in game.


[19-Jun-22 09:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He had AMLs before anyone else in game, unless some mouthbreather in SNF was technically earlier.


[19-Jun-22 09:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and governed Phobos from the early game, for a full year.

A very fortunate sequence of events for you lol 🚀


[20-Jun-22 01:52 AM] allocater#0000
I can put 1 LFE on the CX, 150k seems fair


[20-Jun-22 06:12 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I figure it’s just another corp ship that I’ll be driving. If it makes sense to switch out the buildout at all, let me know. No reason to build bells and whistles we don’t need when the savings can go to the bank

[20-Jun-22 11:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
captainIncognito claims this is the only build that can fly the Hubur route in under 24 hours. larger cargo bays slow it down


[20-Jun-22 11:47 AM] allocater#0000
I played around a bit at you can get ships 10 times faster, but they only reach that top speed if you burn 100% FTL fuel 🤷‍♂️


[20-Jun-22 11:47 AM] allocater#0000
and then charging takes longer then jumping 🤯


[20-Jun-22 11:47 AM] allocater#0000
and 90% fuel is faster then 100% fuel 😵

{Reactions}
🤣 

[20-Jun-22 11:48 AM] allocater#0000
so I concluded the system is a mess


[20-Jun-22 11:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
why cant this FTL warping be easy? This math is all weird!


[20-Jun-22 11:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The charging speed is what pushes the average buyer to prefer the QCR


[20-Jun-22 11:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
even though the FTL travel speed is the slowest among all reactors


[20-Jun-22 11:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe one of our newer members would be interested in performing some flight tests? This just occurred to me

1m jump 1h charge
vs
5m jump 45min charge


[20-Jun-22 12:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
look at the LS-300 --> LS-231 jump


[20-Jun-22 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
max-charge seems slightly faster on 10+ parsec jumps. But the fuel burn is bad.

[21-Jun-22 10:59 AM] insensless72#0000
With the WCB probably 800k, itll be stuck in whatever system you build it in though since it cant FT

[21-Jun-22 12:09 PM] rune_242#0000
and with FTL?


[21-Jun-22 12:10 PM] insensless72#0000
With FTL its a whole different build. Basically the ships we sell currently are generic FTL builds


[21-Jun-22 12:11 PM] insensless72#0000
If you look in the pinned messages its the 3rd one down


[21-Jun-22 12:13 PM] insensless72#0000
4-4.5mil is the going rate, youd need to speak to DLR about ship corp rates


[21-Jun-22 12:40 PM] namthorn#0000
not sure you want to run a GEN with a 1k/3k ship. you'll be going at a crawl on the STL portions when you're fully loaded.


[21-Jun-22 12:41 PM] namthorn#0000
which i assume would be most of the time if you're springing for a larger cargo bay


[21-Jun-22 01:03 PM] rune_242#0000
it's for moving massive amounts of carbon to another planet next to it


[21-Jun-22 01:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea namthorn is saying you should have a more powerful engine


[21-Jun-22 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
max acceleration, unloaded, is 65 m/s2 which is pretty slow


[21-Jun-22 01:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Try with ENG? or FSE?


[21-Jun-22 01:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also which planet were you going to build on? Hephaestus or Deimos?


[21-Jun-22 01:49 PM] rune_242#0000
aaah shit


[21-Jun-22 01:49 PM] rune_242#0000
it's for griffonstone


[21-Jun-22 01:49 PM] rune_242#0000
but I'l wait until I can afford one with FTL


[21-Jun-22 01:50 PM] rune_242#0000
I want a planet with a lot of INC


[21-Jun-22 01:50 PM] churavis#0000
KI-446b?


[21-Jun-22 01:50 PM] rune_242#0000
and with a GOCG for resource extraction


[21-Jun-22 01:50 PM] rune_242#0000
I'l build the FRM on that one


[21-Jun-22 01:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
griffonstone is chemistry. it makes sense to sell carbon to their polymer plants, but you wont get the resource bonus


[21-Jun-22 01:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Have you considered the iron planet in Antares II?


[21-Jun-22 01:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think it is Antares II B


[21-Jun-22 01:52 PM] churavis#0000
I think that's metallurgy


[21-Jun-22 01:53 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, it's metallurgy since shipping FEO doesn't make much sense


[21-Jun-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Somebody check… i thought the idea was extract FEO and do metallurgy on Deimos


[21-Jun-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
shipping FEO to deimos makes sense


[21-Jun-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
STL only


[21-Jun-22 01:53 PM] churavis#0000
I'm hoping to get a glass ship to do exactly that one day for FE and STL production


[21-Jun-22 01:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is what I am getting at. @insensless72 does this with the 3000, but we could build a dedicated slow ship for the same route


[21-Jun-22 01:54 PM] rune_242#0000
the carbon is for own use


[21-Jun-22 01:54 PM] rune_242#0000
I consume 33/day on deimos right now


[21-Jun-22 01:55 PM] rune_242#0000
and I would like to build a bunch of POL on griffonstone


[21-Jun-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah there we go. I was wondering where griffonstone came in to the picture


[21-Jun-22 01:55 PM] churavis#0000
If the corp provided a glass ship I would build an FEO extraction or maybe FE smelting base on the planet and give everyone super cheap FEO or FE


[21-Jun-22 01:56 PM] rune_242#0000
and my own ship would be really nice


[21-Jun-22 01:56 PM] rune_242#0000
I heavily rely on insenssles right now for moving AL from deimos to niks


[21-Jun-22 01:56 PM] churavis#0000
I'm sure a glass ship could support multiple Antares II b bases


[21-Jun-22 01:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it could but now we are talking about 2 different ships. Which is fine.


[21-Jun-22 01:57 PM] rune_242#0000
GOGC of antares II b is metalurgy


[21-Jun-22 01:57 PM] rune_242#0000
just checked


[21-Jun-22 01:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok. thanks for verifying


[21-Jun-22 01:58 PM] rune_242#0000
ah, maybe antares IIg


[21-Jun-22 01:59 PM] rune_242#0000
the upcoming program is resource extraction


[21-Jun-22 01:59 PM] churavis#0000
Antares II g just barely got a CoGC and it is doing resource extraction


[21-Jun-22 01:59 PM] rune_242#0000
I'l make the carbon there and have my H also


[21-Jun-22 01:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@rune_242 I will look at some ships options for you. Since you want it for personal use, it will be a sale. There are some blueprints that will cut down on cost


[21-Jun-22 02:00 PM] rune_242#0000
sounds like a good plan!


[21-Jun-22 02:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[21-Jun-22 02:00 PM] churavis#0000
You'll need AEF instead of MCG and also a good source of INS so your workers toes don't freeze


[21-Jun-22 02:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This can be arranged. Yaro initially built this planet up for personal use


[21-Jun-22 02:00 PM] churavis#0000
It's not impossible but more expensive


[21-Jun-22 02:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but it was abandoned


[21-Jun-22 02:01 PM] insensless72#0000
This is a good idea, I was thinking about doing this myself. Previously I have just communicated with Mum to get deals on 500+ FEO at a time


[21-Jun-22 02:09 PM] rune_242#0000
I still have 1200 INS in stock from building my base on nike


[21-Jun-22 02:09 PM] rune_242#0000
that is enough for 4800 MCG right?


[21-Jun-22 02:11 PM] churavis#0000
INS is 10 per area unit


[21-Jun-22 02:11 PM] churavis#0000
MCG is 4


[21-Jun-22 02:11 PM] rune_242#0000
ahh


[21-Jun-22 02:11 PM] rune_242#0000
I missed
if have SEA from my nike base


[21-Jun-22 02:12 PM] churavis#0000
So 1200 would give you a 300 base, including the module


[21-Jun-22 02:15 PM] rune_242#0000
and I could be governor on antares IIg😎


[21-Jun-22 02:15 PM] churavis#0000
If you want to build the administration center, sure


[21-Jun-22 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
There's only 1 base there currently and it's only 18% developed so I'm not sure what the point would be besides vanity


[21-Jun-22 02:17 PM] churavis#0000
You'd be lord of the flies, if there are flies on freezing gas giants


[21-Jun-22 02:27 PM] rune_242#0000
that would be pretty expensive...


[21-Jun-22 02:29 PM] rune_242#0000
I could be a corporate jet too


[21-Jun-22 02:30 PM] rune_242#0000
if I only use it myself for 2-4 trips a week when it's fully loaded with either 1k C or 1k AL
and the rest is for the corp


[21-Jun-22 03:39 PM] allocater#0000
The CQM is shipping, only LHPs are missing, unless @insensless72 has 94 stored on heph


[21-Jun-22 03:49 PM] yang_mills#0000
@insensless72 @allocater @bitcoin_ape I have 56 LHP on Heph. Whoever has storage room for it can request it. I also requested 85K AIC on the LM. This is the payment for the 56 LHP (1518 AIC/u). Perhaps @bitcoin_ape can pay me.

nobody is expecting a STL ship for now, right?


[24-Jun-22 01:02 PM] namthorn#0000
no idea, but i was given lfps so made one. having it in reserve doesn't hurt.


[24-Jun-22 01:03 PM] allocater#0000
yup


[24-Jun-22 01:05 PM] insensless72#0000
ill have another 4 LFP for you in 3 days


[24-Jun-22 01:06 PM] namthorn#0000
i wont have the RG for that yet, so can put into a FSE if we need to


[24-Jun-22 01:07 PM] insensless72#0000
I make 10 at a time, 4 for you, 6 for me, so just hang onto them until you can use them. Doesnt sound like we need a GEN right away anyways


[24-Jun-22 01:08 PM] namthorn#0000

[25-Jun-22 12:53 AM] allocater#0000
Everything ready on my side, I am turning it over to @insensless72 to report FSE QCR LHP completion 👉

@jackinabox86 has been doing some welding


[26-Jun-22 09:15 PM] insensless72#0000
We need a few CHA from someone, were out pacing Allocaters and I no longer have the room on Deimos with the 5ht ASM


[26-Jun-22 09:45 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I haven’t built a WEL yet. Don’t have access to HE is the major impediment


[27-Jun-22 06:30 AM] namthorn#0000
universe seems to be running a little low on HE in general.


[27-Jun-22 11:17 AM] allocater#0000
speaking of which, I can do 6 CHA more, then I am also out of HE 😅

I've been thinking of making a glass smelting base on YK-649b, are GF products the bottle neck for glass STL ships? Is there a big need in the corp for more glass?


[27-Jun-22 08:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is a good idea. GF time is indeed the bottleneck on glass ships. There is also a need for THF for the fuel pumps, which has lately been in contention with INS production.

[27-Jun-22 08:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
GF time/free glass is also needed to regularly supply test tubes on our many governed planets...

@exeler how is the helium adventure going?


[02-Jul-22 08:50 PM] insensless72#0000
We have options, I have a few spare HE in reserve, in the meantime we can get BOS to someone with a WEL and have them push 6 GV then 6 CHA, thats 12 HE 12 AL and 60 BOS. @mitlof Is it possible we could get you to help with this on Nike?


[02-Jul-22 09:38 PM] exeler#0000
I got all the mats, next time I get one I gotta finish out all the contracts, load up my ship, and send it off. 

Been out of town, so don't know when the next time I'll be on will be. Hopefully in the next day or two.


[03-Jul-22 02:19 AM] allocater#0000
"final" CHA batch is ready in 1h


[03-Jul-22 02:21 AM] allocater#0000
but if no one wants to build a WEL on heph (or phobos) I guess, I build a second one


[03-Jul-22 02:35 AM] mitlof#0000
Sure, I wanted to help but was stuck by the He


[03-Jul-22 02:39 AM] allocater#0000
HE on my side will last long enough for the HE base to go online, how long LHP/etc on deimos can hold on, I don't know


[03-Jul-22 06:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape @insensless72 @allocater I brought 100 LHP to Heph. Whoever has enough inventory space please request it. That's 500 t and 1000 m^3. I also requested 150 K AIC on Heph LM. That's my pay (1500 AIC per unit of LHP). Perhaps @bitcoin_ape could fill my request.

The next build after Domicius' 3000t ship is a 2000t build for @yjhasaday .

This is of course depending on the production/logistics issues that were discussed above in this channel.


[03-Jul-22 01:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
After these 2 insider ship builds, I would like to go for a public sale with cool upgrades


[03-Jul-22 01:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
both AGS and STS will be on the menu and advertised by me. These are hopefully practical enough to catch some attention 😄

[03-Jul-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think we should make at least 2 HPR. Perhaps HYR is not economically viable


[03-Jul-22 02:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 this means we need 10 CTF, 10 extra WAL, and 8 AFR. Namthorn is supplying the EES.


[03-Jul-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
please prioritize the QCR + FSE, we need to wait for now anyways. Allocater has not yet made the FIR, for which he is missing some components.


[03-Jul-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If FSE production gets stuck, try doubleing up on QCR. This will open up a window in ~2 weeks to produce an HPR without interfering with other production


[03-Jul-22 02:45 PM] allocater#0000
ads up for 2 FIR inputs on heph


[03-Jul-22 02:49 PM] allocater#0000

if I have HE I can make 120 every 1d4h

I have a feeling there's going to be a demand for WCB and LCB and other parts necessary to upgrade starter ships. This is going to be popular among middle age players who can't afford a new ship, especially trial players that can't even field more than two ships, nor put out shipping contracts:

nice, i would certainly buy a big cargo bay and whatever engine i need to lug around 2k/2k.


[04-Jul-22 12:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since titanium is extremely slow to produce, i think we should try to get ahead here


[04-Jul-22 12:47 PM] namthorn#0000
im out of ore on deimos


[04-Jul-22 12:47 PM] namthorn#0000
over 1k on se-648c though


[04-Jul-22 12:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
our ship building to date has been bottlenecked by engine production, but there is another soft bottleneck lurking just below this on the metal production side, and demand for even 1-2 cargo bays could tip the scales, so to speak.


[04-Jul-22 12:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also i assume the titanium markets will be red hot


[04-Jul-22 12:50 PM] namthorn#0000
they already are, market is completely dry. I was selling at 1750 per when i had some to sell at the cx

probably not the CQM one actually


[04-Jul-22 12:58 PM] namthorn#0000
that rrequires the WAI which is an expensive addition iirc?


[04-Jul-22 12:58 PM] namthorn#0000
you'd probably get the wealthier people go for it, but i think the broad market appeal will be the cheaper option


[04-Jul-22 12:58 PM] namthorn#0000
fewer parts to change out


[04-Jul-22 01:00 PM] allocater#0000
and strangely WCB is actually also a cheap version due to balancing-bug(?):

[04-Jul-22 01:00 PM] allocater#0000
yeah


[04-Jul-22 01:01 PM] churavis#0000
It sort of makes sense, the WCB would be smaller and require a less large FTL field


[04-Jul-22 01:01 PM] namthorn#0000
i think you'll see that, followed by more efficient engines being popular.


[04-Jul-22 01:01 PM] allocater#0000 (pinned)
so upgrade from starter ship to ore-hauler is: WCB + LFE + 25 SSC + 16 BHP

[04-Jul-22 01:02 PM] namthorn#0000
bargain, doubles your volume hauling too


[04-Jul-22 01:03 PM] namthorn#0000
getting some of these kits together would be a decent idea


[04-Jul-22 01:03 PM] allocater#0000
then those are the items to pump out, even if just to upgrade our 20 starter ships 😄

[04-Jul-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
start out selling day 1 imo, then use the leftovers and future ones for our own market


[04-Jul-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
more cash, and we have a few haulers running already. prices will likely cool off after a couple weeks


[04-Jul-22 01:06 PM] allocater#0000
our ship sales might actually collapse for a while since new ships can't compete with upgrade anymore


[04-Jul-22 01:06 PM] namthorn#0000

people buying new ships are rolling in it


[04-Jul-22 01:06 PM] allocater#0000
not sure, nobody will buy a hauler, if they can upgrade to a hauler for 10% the cost


[04-Jul-22 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There will still be demand for full FTL builds I think


[04-Jul-22 01:07 PM] namthorn#0000
^ new engines, plus 2k/2k reqiures CQM


[04-Jul-22 01:07 PM] namthorn#0000
and that is a reasonably popular spec


[04-Jul-22 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
these are already corp-to-corp sales as it stands, except for odd cases of super rich individuals


[04-Jul-22 01:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also AML related production will heat up I think. These materials were already expensive and now everyone will want specialized items

@domicius to build the ship, you first need to go to your blueprints buffer with this command: `BLU`

[04-Jul-22 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Then, go to the #🏭hephaestus shipyard with this command, and start a new project `SHY ZV-307c`


[04-Jul-22 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You will need to use this new blueprint to create the project.


[04-Jul-22 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
from there, you must contribute all of the necessary components to that project until the ship is complete, at which point it will build on hephaestus


[04-Jul-22 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Make sure to double check your blueprint and the items that you have before building.

@OOG Shareholder our shipbuilding operations continue… We are willing to pay for the following production on Hephaestus:
1. FS to make BGO and BRO
2. SCA to make SEN and PCB
3. UPF to produce BR1, CQM, TCU


[09-Jul-22 03:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
please let us know if you are interested.


[09-Jul-22 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is also room for more AML and more smelting/ASM work on griffonstone and Deimos, respectively. Its also feasible to do AML on other planets if you like.


[09-Jul-22 03:51 PM] churavis#0000
I have some excess capacity for my existing FS. Currently it's making UTS for upkeep but I have 2 BGO in stock.


[09-Jul-22 03:56 PM] churavis#0000
Up until now it's been making BCO and BGC that I'm using to try and set records for the most nose-gouging prices on the CX

[09-Jul-22 04:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Fs should probably stay on Deimos given the COGC? I’m open to expanding my two FS there and doing more orders for the group. I’m also always happy to do another base if the capital is available. As long as my frequent bfabs orders aren’t a burden, then I don’t have to start a Nike one

jk I overlooked the one on Heph. When you assign those to your blueprint lmk and ill fill the 94 LHP


[09-Jul-22 05:28 PM] namthorn#0000
I think the idea with putting BRO and BGO on heph is that they're very heavy so harder to ship. So it turns the logistics from "source of mats -> deimos -> heph" into "source of mats -> heph"

To answer your question, it was going just fine until now. mumzhar isnt selling FEO at the rate he was anymore, which means my FE source has dried up. Ill need to find it in corp or buy high on the CX to produce more FET. Im slowly powering through this W to make CTF

[23-Jul-22 04:48 AM] namthorn#0000
@yjhasaday hows your RG situation?


[23-Jul-22 07:28 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Unfortunately not available. I keep forgetting to bring PG to Deimos. I have stockpiles of GL and TUB now so I can set all GFs to RG once I move some of the PG I bought on Nike


[23-Jul-22 09:39 AM] insensless72#0000
I have a total of 8 LFPs on Deimos ready for you

we have humant in hortus and shadowsneak of GDP


[23-Jul-22 10:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and now this guy as well, 3 STL ships total


[23-Jul-22 10:59 PM] churavis#0000
Didn't you say you had GEN lying around?


[24-Jul-22 02:44 AM] allocater#0000
time to make defensive quotes by raising the price to 700k


[24-Jul-22 10:55 AM] allocater#0000
I think we should hold the normal ship production and do 10 WCB first to upgrade our normal ships.


[24-Jul-22 11:00 AM] allocater#0000
1 upgrade per day should be possible


[24-Jul-22 11:01 AM] churavis#0000
Those are 600 TI each, no?


[24-Jul-22 11:02 AM] allocater#0000
125 TI for each WCB

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Jul-22 01:48 PM] namthorn#0000
I would pay premium for a couple of WCB kits


[24-Jul-22 01:49 PM] namthorn#0000
also another GEN will be at heph  in ~12hrs


[24-Jul-22 01:53 PM] allocater#0000
looks like current price is:

WCB = 350k
LFE = 150k
25 SSC + 16 BHP = 35k
===
535k to upgrade starter ship


[24-Jul-22 01:58 PM] allocater#0000
I can do LFE SSC BHP, but I need WCB


[24-Jul-22 02:20 PM] namthorn#0000
sounds fair


[24-Jul-22 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can I get a price/time estimate on a ftl ship with a nice cargo capacity [balanced volume/weight]?


[24-Jul-22 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also what benefits will this upgrade have on a starter ship?


[24-Jul-22 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just wanna stock up liquid to get the ship components so when I get PRO again I can do as much as possible


[24-Jul-22 06:27 PM] insensless72#0000
2000t FTL runs about 4.5mil, by utilizing upgrades you can turn one of your starter ships into a 2000t hauler instead of buying a whole new ship


[24-Jul-22 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh, so I can have 2 2k ships for 1m basically?


[24-Jul-22 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Instead of 2 500 m3/t ships?


[24-Jul-22 06:29 PM] insensless72#0000
Essentially yes. The upgrades are going to drive the price of ships down it seems, while increasing demand quantities of products since many more players will have access to larger ships


[24-Jul-22 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
And what options are there for balanced weight and volume cargo bays? I don’t think I would want to have a higher capacity for one over the other


[24-Jul-22 06:30 PM] insensless72#0000
LCB is 2000/2000 WCB is 1000/3000


[24-Jul-22 06:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
LCB seems like the better option, upgrading my standard with one of those will be roughly the same $ as upgrading with a WCB right?


[24-Jul-22 06:32 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes, the price for both is really dependent upon TI prices


[24-Jul-22 06:32 PM] insensless72#0000
125 TI  for LCB or WCB, but LCB takes 200 AST where WCB takes 100 AST and 100 FET


[24-Jul-22 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Got it


[24-Jul-22 07:01 PM] churavis#0000
If I were to supply the GEN, how much would it cost for the rest of the 500t/500m build?

I want to make an STL only ship to go between Deimos and my STL/FE/FEO base on Antares II b as well as possibly other future bases in the system.


[24-Jul-22 07:14 PM] insensless72#0000
SCB 25K
SSL 30k


[24-Jul-22 07:15 PM] insensless72#0000
LHP I would estimate around 50k


[24-Jul-22 07:19 PM] churavis#0000
SSC?


[24-Jul-22 07:19 PM] insensless72#0000
That would be Runes department


[25-Jul-22 01:59 AM] allocater#0000
upgrade with LCB will be much more expensive, because it also requires CQM

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[25-Jul-22 02:00 AM] allocater#0000
600k - GEN

I forgot how we value GEN, 150k? So that leaves 450k


[25-Jul-22 06:44 AM] namthorn#0000
1000/3000 is the way to go for a budget upgrade - possibly a dev oversight that WCB only requires CQS. CQM adds quite a lot to the pricetag.


[25-Jul-22 06:47 AM] namthorn#0000
and on the GEN front, I think about 100-120k


[25-Jul-22 09:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm


[26-Jul-22 10:50 AM] allocater#0000
So if I get this right we need every day:

250 TIO production
ship 250 TIO to deimos
63 SME smelting it into 125 TI
21 ASM smelting it into AST/FET

how close are we on each step?


[26-Jul-22 11:00 AM] rune_242#0000
added SSC to the sheet


[26-Jul-22 12:54 PM] namthorn#0000
what's the target for that? 1 WCB/d?


[26-Jul-22 12:54 PM] namthorn#0000
or just in generl


[26-Jul-22 12:56 PM] dersix#0000
with the re-work of my deimos base, I'll have 10 SME and 3 ASM running AST (or also FET but then I've to ask for more FE/FEO  from churavis 🙂 )


[26-Jul-22 12:57 PM] namthorn#0000
i can probably demo some stuff and set up a bit more SME capacity once we get the TIO flowing in at a regular cadence.


[26-Jul-22 12:58 PM] allocater#0000
yup 1 WCB per day


[26-Jul-22 12:58 PM] namthorn#0000
I reckon aim for one every few days to start with and ramp it up.


[26-Jul-22 12:59 PM] allocater#0000
yes, this is the ramp up 😄


[26-Jul-22 12:59 PM] namthorn#0000
so, divide that by 2/4 and we get some workable figures


[26-Jul-22 12:59 PM] namthorn#0000
for 1 every 2/4 days


[26-Jul-22 01:02 PM] namthorn#0000
I also dont think you need that many SME.


[26-Jul-22 01:02 PM] namthorn#0000
about 29-30 should get you 125 TI/d with 5 metallurgy experts


[26-Jul-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
and similarly 14 ASMs would use 125 TI/d


[26-Jul-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
actually less


[26-Jul-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
11


[26-Jul-22 01:04 PM] allocater#0000
then we are not that bad


[26-Jul-22 01:05 PM] allocater#0000
I posted the upgrade pack status to #ship-status


[26-Jul-22 01:05 PM] namthorn#0000
still need the AL/FE smelting alongside it though, i guess that's why you added more smelters?


[26-Jul-22 01:05 PM] allocater#0000

I can do some switching between AL and TI as well; have 9 SME


[26-Jul-22 03:06 PM] allocater#0000
anybody who can convert some TIO, request TIO with ads. As much as you want to convert in 2 days.


[26-Jul-22 03:10 PM] dersix#0000
requested 100, do you want TI back or directly AST ?


[26-Jul-22 03:11 PM] allocater#0000
if you have ASM, ASTify it, Inseneless will scoop up all TI AST and FET


[26-Jul-22 03:13 PM] insensless72#0000

At the moment we try to get SKF online 100% of the time, so more AST and FET is needed from ASMs, which also need more TI. @insensless72 can give a better update on how close we are and what is still lacking

3.5 mil for the ship package in #ship-status 

0.5 mil for the upgrade packages

Open Shipbuilding Jobs:

* ~~ZIR miner~~
* BTS miner
* ~~BER miner~~
* TIO transporter
* AML to produce ZR BOS
* ~~FS to produce BRO/BGO for Engines on heph and/or BGC/HCC for capacitors on phobos~~
* ~~UPF to produce TCU/CQM/BR1 on phobos or heph~~

[10-Aug-22 11:30 AM] jackinabox86#0000
why did we build 2k/2k ships for ftl instead of more 1k/3k ships?  I'm trying to work out what the best BLU would be for an STL ship that could be upgraded to an FTL ship later


[10-Aug-22 11:30 AM] jackinabox86#0000
was it that the glass engine was so much cheaper than the FSE or something?


[10-Aug-22 11:32 AM] churavis#0000
1k/3k ships only hold more units than 2k/2k if the material has a tonnage to volume ratio of 3:1 or more, that's not a lot of materials.


[10-Aug-22 11:32 AM] churavis#0000
It's ores and metals mostly


[10-Aug-22 11:33 AM] jackinabox86#0000
that makes sense


[10-Aug-22 11:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it just seems that now that ships are (likely) cheaper, it would make more sense to have two 3k/1k ships versus one 2k/2k, but maybe the costs of upgrading an STL to FTL are still cost-prohibitive enough to make only one FTL ship upgrade possible (so make that the best FTL one can)


[10-Aug-22 11:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
also, for me, virtually all of the large items I carry are ores, carbon, or metal; I don't do a lot of gas shipping


[10-Aug-22 11:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
particularly in the core of ANT space (Phobos to Deimos to Nike for example)


[10-Aug-22 11:35 AM] churavis#0000
Carbon is 2.25:1, so 2k/2k holds more units


[10-Aug-22 11:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
sure, but I don't want the expensive perfect to be the enemy of the affordable good


[10-Aug-22 11:38 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it appears that moving from a WCB to a LCB requires a larger crew quarters and significantly more SSC/LHP for example


[10-Aug-22 11:40 AM] allocater#0000
yeah LCB is much more expensive, but it was the most favored build by customers. And now there is an argument to be made that since all starter ships become WCB ships, that LCB ships become even more rare/valued/desirable? Maybe. We produce whatever is ordered 😄


[10-Aug-22 11:40 AM] allocater#0000
Actually the difference is only CQS vs CQM, so maybe not that much


[10-Aug-22 11:42 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it's annoying that you can't build an STL ship with an FTL bridge


[10-Aug-22 11:42 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I wouldn't want to buy one bridge for the STL build and then have to do another bridge for FTL


[10-Aug-22 11:46 AM] churavis#0000
I don't know that it's worth it to go from an STL ship to an FTL one, you might as well just build a new ship at that point


[10-Aug-22 11:46 AM] jackinabox86#0000
that's what I'm trying to figure out


[10-Aug-22 11:46 AM] jackinabox86#0000
is it better to just save up for a decent ftl


[10-Aug-22 11:46 AM] jackinabox86#0000
or try to bridge a cheap stl into a future decent ftl


[10-Aug-22 11:50 AM] jackinabox86#0000
someone should build a ship building calculator where you can see prices adjust in total and per component as a blueprint option is changed


[10-Aug-22 11:51 AM] jackinabox86#0000
obviously what prices to use would be tough, but it's not that hard to mock some numbers in; it's just hard to get them to relate to one another in real time!


[10-Aug-22 11:51 AM] churavis#0000
Corp prices don't change that often


[10-Aug-22 11:55 AM] jackinabox86#0000
true, but those wouldn't be avaialble to whoever built a calculator.  I'm not good enough to build an internal one at least!


[10-Aug-22 11:57 AM] churavis#0000
If they don't change that often then it wouldn't be hard to put them in manually


[10-Aug-22 12:00 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, I assume one could just let the user input prices for each component (or use some average suggested by the calculator).  the real trick would be making the calculator output match the output of the in-game blueprint tool.  There are a ton of potential combinations and no real logic (to my eye) in how they all are determined


[10-Aug-22 12:01 PM] churavis#0000
Corp prices don't change that often, so there's no reason for users to need to put them in. If it's a shared document then only one person needs to put them in when it changes.


[10-Aug-22 12:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, I'm talking about for another prosperous university community tool


[10-Aug-22 12:03 PM] churavis#0000
Also, there may be a ton of potential combinations of ship features, but only a few viable ones that make sense, so you'd only need to put a few in while leaving the possibility for the user to input new ones if they want some obscure build.


[10-Aug-22 12:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
you're absolutely right about something we'd do internal


[10-Aug-22 12:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'd definitely skip all the shielding options in a tool.  Maybe do the seats since people seem interested in that


[10-Aug-22 12:04 PM] churavis#0000
Seats are necessary to take advantage of certain high powered engines

That looks good.  Will be interested to see it when it has bridge/crew quarters on it.  Where did you find the structure points?  Just figured it out?


[10-Aug-22 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pretty weird how the high volume cargo bay has a huge structural requirement but the high load bay doiesn't.


[10-Aug-22 01:46 PM] churavis#0000
High load means small volume


[10-Aug-22 01:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
So small surface area and few hull plates, but in my fiction it needs extra thick I-Beams or something 😛


[10-Aug-22 01:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaah, just going down the list and checking the number with the in-game tool. It looks like the crew quarters probably bumps up at 90 structural points, but it could be more complicated


[10-Aug-22 01:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, you'd think it would need a stronger frame requiring more structural support.  Who knows

without fueltanks it's 1.5M


[11-Aug-22 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, I've been working on ship building math for a while now. This thing is _all over the place_. The only thing I can say definitively is number of structure (SSC) is the ship volume / 21, rounded up. Emitter count is a total mess. Going off the source code and a blog post, it's probably based on volume, and the small, med, and large emitters probably provide something like 125m3, 350m3, and 1000m3 of coverage (or span), based on the reported volume of the ship in the builder. There are some real oddities especially at the 1000m3 breakpoint (which is important breakpoint, cause it's right where the starter ships sit, at 963m3). I think there's some hard coding to avoid large emitters <1000m3. I think understanding this behavior could be really valuable, since it seems easier to make 1 large FTL emitter than 3 medium and 1 small.. so at various points ships may actually get cheaper by bumping up their volume. 

Emitter power requirement isn't proportional to their "span", so messing with emitter count probably can improve charge speed.  (again a case where increasing your volume might improve or worsen things, depending on where the breakpoints fall)

There's also mass oddities with fuel tanks. Upgrading a small cargo bay ship from a small FTL tank to medium adds 76 tons, but the same upgrade in a medium cargo bay ship adds 66 tons. That's fine, but it's reversed for the FTL tank, small cargo upgrade ads 16 tons, but a large cargo ship upgrading the FTL tank adds 26 tons. So the pattern is reversed there. 

I think there's bugs in calculating the emitter count from the volume, or just super non-obvious behavior. If there are non-zero small emitters, one may be added for you, whether you need it or not. So being aware of that can get you some "free" volume.


[11-Aug-22 03:09 PM] churavis#0000
How about you translate that into a few optimal builds or upgrades?


[11-Aug-22 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
😛 ideally, yes


[11-Aug-22 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I might report it as a bug first, haha. Although I doubt they can change it mid-universe.


[11-Aug-22 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've considered the `FTL_VOLUME_SPAN` in the source to be a number in m3, a radius of a sphere, a diameter of a sphere, and some 2d versions, in case things were done in m2 not m3, and none of it really makes sense.


[11-Aug-22 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
If I can get a cost for the 3 emitter sizes, I can apply that to optimal builds / upgrades. Haven't really gotten that far yet


[11-Aug-22 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
LFE, MFE, and SFE- I have LFE @ 100,000 each


[11-Aug-22 03:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
you should post in the PRUN Community Tools discord.  I'm not a programmer, so I can't follow most of what happens there, but I think most of the most knowledgeable theorycrafters are there.  They may know things we don't.  Once you finish this, you should make it available to anyone (sans our prices)


[11-Aug-22 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh, I'm not familiar with that discord, but I've just joined it. Thanks for the tip!


[11-Aug-22 04:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
One insight, If you take a 963m3 starter ship, add a Medium STL Fuel Tank, you bump it up above 1000m3. Then a min fuel trip from Nike to Harmonia 1) uses half the FTL fuel it used to use. 2) gets done in 20hr instead of 26 hours. 3) uses 8 more STL fuel due to the extra size. This is because it goes from 3 small, 2 med emitters to 1 small, 1 large. There's probably dozens of local maxima for ship design like this.

[11-Aug-22 05:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It would be cool if you could overpower a ship when creating it, primarily with emitters, bridge, or crew quarters. Then you could start with a smaller cargo bay or save an emitter or two to get the ship going and then upgrade it later without losing anything you initially installed. Like if one LFE could handle a 500/500 that could later be expanded


[11-Aug-22 05:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
As it is, there is virtually no benefit to building a smaller ship and upgrading it later. You upgrade the starters and then either build a full FTL or a small potatoes STL

Weirdly, if you add basic high-g seats to a glass ship, it actually slows down.  So do Advanced.


[12-Aug-22 10:09 AM] churavis#0000
Glass ships don't accelerate enough to need high-g seats so they're just extra weight


[12-Aug-22 10:10 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Has anyone taken the base transport to Demeter that you offered? I want to move my carbon production from Deimos to Demeter - once I do I will have room for a couple more GFs on Deimos and I can start working on GEN - but as of right now I'm pretty far from it


[12-Aug-22 10:34 AM] allocater#0000
There are 2 candidates so far, will probably finalize the 2 farm bases on the weekend


[12-Aug-22 10:36 AM] churavis#0000

That's being turned into a food processing planet


[12-Aug-22 10:46 AM] jackinabox86#0000
which planet is going to the be the INC planet?


[12-Aug-22 10:47 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I really think this isn't necessary. The SIO burns very slowly so its really easy to import and the Deimos COGC is already metallurgy - so adding additional logistics just isn't worth it when it can be done on Deimos. The only constraint on Deimos is base space (because I want to keep some smelters to feed my prefab plants on Nike) but even then I should be able to get up to 6 GFs on Deimos

TIO production is ramping up to a sustainable scale on 401b. It will be getting it to Deimos and smelting through it that will become the issues. I have 400 stacked on Deimos currently which is enough to keep the (my) ASMs fed for 4 days, not including Pokters


[12-Aug-22 03:28 PM] jackinabox86#0000
TIO is so light relative to volume that it's best in a 2k/2k.  We used to talk about setting up a recurring Demeter run for the corp ships; maybe we should do that for KI-401b

[12-Aug-22 03:29 PM] insensless72#0000
100%, I only used Bucey to get us rolling. Well thats not true I will continue if need be as well


[12-Aug-22 03:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
with the starter ship upgrades, that's not much worse than a 2k/2k.  It's making some of my other trips easier, which could help me get out more, but we just need more hulls, period


[12-Aug-22 03:31 PM] jackinabox86#0000
do we know how quickly you all can fill a 2k on 401b?  OOG2002 will be free tomorrow and can run out


[12-Aug-22 03:32 PM] insensless72#0000
I just stacked 880 into Bucephalus between Allocater and I. I have 9 EXT producing 40 TIO ea every 2 days 17hrs


[12-Aug-22 03:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Theyre not on the same schedule though so its spread out typically its batches of 120


[12-Aug-22 03:34 PM] insensless72#0000
also that time will reduce in 2 days as hopefully PIO demand will be filled with the next POPR


[12-Aug-22 03:40 PM] allocater#0000
yes that would be the TIO transporter job. 401b <-> deimos


[12-Aug-22 03:41 PM] jackinabox86#0000
sure; I doubt anyone has a spare ship sitting around to do it dedicated though.  I'm happy to do a couple trips a month or something though, or more frequently in a couple weeks when I have my STL


[12-Aug-22 03:43 PM] churavis#0000
What do you mean "when I have my STL"?


[12-Aug-22 03:44 PM] allocater#0000
both bases at full will be 1000t per day, so we can even build a ship for that route


[12-Aug-22 03:46 PM] insensless72#0000
I have a STO on 401b so I could go a little longer


[12-Aug-22 03:47 PM] allocater#0000
dito, that's just average throughput, we can also come with an armada every friday 😄

I'm trying to accumulate everything I need for an STL glass ship.  Obviously, I won't request to buy anything from our builders until all the upgrades are finished or whatever


[12-Aug-22 03:58 PM] churavis#0000
I was going to say, if you need STeeL then all you have to do is ask

If this this the build you're interested in then it could be done quickly. SSL and SCB I have the supplies for and LHP is ready on Heph. Youd just have to check with Allocater about the BRS, CQT, and Rune about the SSC. Also Namthorn produces GEN

Also, remember that glass engines are slow gas guzzlers


[12-Aug-22 04:06 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Lol, I thought you had lots of shade for my plans to build an stl ship.  I'm not super fussed about the speed given it's only going to live in ANT1 and fuel isn't an issue for me

[12-Aug-22 04:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I'd be looking for the standard build, but I'm going to need a bit more time to get the capital for that alongside finishing my second starter ship upgrade.  Shouldn't be more than a couple weeks.  I had been keeping quiet since I know the focus was on upgrading folks and selling the nice FTL builds out of corp for cash


[12-Aug-22 04:08 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill go ahead and produce the SSL and SCB for you while I wait on FET for the WCBs that way theyre ready when you want them

can you use mini-upgrades as free repairs? 🤔

No


[13-Aug-22 10:37 AM] insensless72#0000
Unfortunately not at the moment, I need to get ZR from Phobos to Deimos to make them

Generally, how much is a boat? For example, it's like the first two boats.


[14-Aug-22 05:14 AM] allocater#0000
it's 3.5mil for a standard ship

@Shipwright Do we need more LHP or rather more BHP? I guess BHP is needed for ship upgrades.


[14-Aug-22 11:54 AM] allocater#0000
We have BHP  for 13 ship upgrades, but only LHP for 2 ships, so I would say LHP


[14-Aug-22 11:54 AM] yang_mills#0000
Got it.


[14-Aug-22 12:31 PM] churavis#0000
Does anyone make BPT?


[14-Aug-22 12:37 PM] allocater#0000
don't think so, does SPP even still run?

[14-Aug-22 12:57 PM] dersix#0000
for the rest, if we can source the inputs I can also build the stuff


[14-Aug-22 01:04 PM] churavis#0000
ZDLR can make BE with BER from the CX
ZDLR can also make the CF
We'd need to find someone with WEL capacity


[14-Aug-22 01:05 PM] churavis#0000
Do you have other stuff you can make with your SPP in the mean time?


[14-Aug-22 01:08 PM] allocater#0000
there are still 120 ancient THP on heph you can have


[14-Aug-22 01:10 PM] churavis#0000
Wow, cool, then we only need THF


[14-Aug-22 01:10 PM] allocater#0000
how much?


[14-Aug-22 01:11 PM] churavis#0000
It needs 43 BPT but it's made in batches of 10 so 5 batches times 20 is 100 THF


[14-Aug-22 01:11 PM] allocater#0000
ok then that's also on heph


[14-Aug-22 01:12 PM] churavis#0000
Price for each?


[14-Aug-22 01:13 PM] allocater#0000
THF 200/u
THP free


[14-Aug-22 01:13 PM] churavis#0000
Free?

I got it free, I give it free, 😄

Wow, that's super convenient


[14-Aug-22 02:37 PM] churavis#0000
If I provide the inputs, what's the price for the use of the SPP?

[14-Aug-22 05:29 PM] dersix#0000
well there is not that much to do in a SPP otherwise, I've some AGS on stock and for the other stuff there is not really a market (at least none that I see right now 🙂 )


[14-Aug-22 05:30 PM] churavis#0000
With upgrades possible, people may be more interested in adding small things like thermal protection since they don't have to do it when they make the ship so it's easier. We should consider advertising things once we get a bit in stock.

What are the prices for TI for shipbuilding?


[15-Aug-22 04:41 PM] insensless72#0000
Ive been providing TIO for free and paying 1k per TI to those who smelt it for me. Are you looking to purchase FET?


[15-Aug-22 05:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am looking to purchase both, my SME have to be on AL and so I won’t be able to make my own TI even if I got TIO. I’ll have to buy TI and FET


[15-Aug-22 05:04 PM] insensless72#0000
Approximately how much FET are you wanting? Currently all my FET is being funneled into ship components


[15-Aug-22 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
2 FET /d should be good


[15-Aug-22 05:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
And 2.7 DEC /d if anyone has the production for that


[15-Aug-22 06:36 PM] insensless72#0000
I think ZDLR has the potential to make DEC, the continuous feed of FET I could not do currently though


[15-Aug-22 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
This makes me curious, what is our source for BR1/CQM at the moment then?

Isn’t it you? I thought you were building the UPF on Phobos


[16-Aug-22 02:47 AM] allocater#0000
I built the old BR1/CQM with DEC from DLR


[16-Aug-22 02:48 AM] allocater#0000
AUO from CX or 650 and self-smelting


[16-Aug-22 02:49 AM] allocater#0000
TI/FET/AST from Insensless


[16-Aug-22 02:50 AM] allocater#0000

Yes. It’s roughly 500k to upgrade a starting ship to a 3000t/1000m hauler. Very cost effective


[19-Aug-22 07:56 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don’t know what our stock is, but someone is offering 1 million for a CQM on UFO

[28-Aug-22 09:51 AM] insensless72#0000
@OOG Shareholder If anyone would like an upgrade let me know. Currently I dont have any queued. WCB turns your ship into a 3000 and LCB turns it into a 2000

I pay prices though, it doesn't feel right getting almost 200k worth of stuff for free, dunno bout the others


[30-Aug-22 09:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I'll be starting up production of HCC/BGC connectors, especially if there's a steady need for them. It's a way for me to efficiently ship the gold I have off QJ-650c. But my initial prunner layout for the base was making 100 connectors a day (either HCC or BGC), and I wonder if that's way too much


[30-Aug-22 09:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's 1 LFE + 1 MFE per day worth of connectors 😬


[30-Aug-22 09:43 PM] allocater#0000
ship production needs every 5 days:
120 HCC
90 BGC
50 BCO
but some HCC is already covered by Churavis, although we can make extra field emitters to sell on the CX

2 upgrade packs ready, if you didn't upgrade yet, also on 60d credit


[31-Aug-22 10:26 AM] allocater#0000
you take your starter ship and put WCB, LFE, 16 BHP and 25 SSC on it and it becomes a ship that can transport 3000t (1000m³) instead of 500t.


[31-Aug-22 10:26 AM] allocater#0000
it costs 500.000 AIC


[31-Aug-22 10:44 AM] allocater#0000
it takes 24h


[31-Aug-22 10:45 AM] allocater#0000
60 days to pay for it


[31-Aug-22 10:46 AM] balbar#0000
Any reason why you would go for the high tonnage version instead of 2k/2k or the high volume one?


[31-Aug-22 10:46 AM] allocater#0000
it's way cheaper


[31-Aug-22 10:47 AM] balbar#0000
ah, makes sense


[31-Aug-22 10:47 AM] allocater#0000
2k/2k costs 1 million more


[31-Aug-22 10:47 AM] balbar#0000
whoah


[31-Aug-22 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I would really enjoy a s WCB upgrade pack. I can get 500k in 60 days no problem.


[31-Aug-22 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm definitely shipping constrained


[31-Aug-22 11:15 AM] allocater#0000
then you can get 1 each, just request the materials on heph LM for 1 AIC and I will sell 1 DW for 500k to you

`mat VCB` is High-Volume Cargo Bay. So... I guess WCB was more like "High Weight Cargo Bay"

We are looking for an SPF operator. To produce FSE and QCR. Inputs are provided except CHA. BOS still comes from zDLR for now and FAL from Insensless but is undersupplied. 

If anyone is interested we can go into more details.


[01-Sep-22 12:48 AM] churavis#0000
It doesn't look like Heph has the ENG or SCI for another SPF

[01-Sep-22 12:51 AM] allocater#0000
we would dismantle the other SPFs but the transition would be a problem


[01-Sep-22 12:52 AM] allocater#0000
and we operate it without SCI


[01-Sep-22 01:02 AM] _bojidar#0000
What would be needed for all this if some1 is interested :)


[01-Sep-22 01:12 AM] allocater#0000
you would need to buy or produce everything to produce 1 FSE and 1 QCR every 5 days. You can look up the entire chain for it. BOS, ACS, CBS, RAG you will get. FAL BRO and BGO you will get if need to, but it would be better to get your own production. You can also only start with FSE and ignore QCR. The payment would be 100k per day for FSE.


[01-Sep-22 01:15 AM] _bojidar#0000
And a question since some people can do anything .. why not do it..it will be quiet fast and easy for them..or is it about more people involved or else?


[01-Sep-22 01:16 AM] _bojidar#0000
For New people it will take long time to buy/build and get all running


[01-Sep-22 01:17 AM] allocater#0000
It's so much work, so we want to put it on more shoulders. atm Insensless is doing it, but also doing SKF.


[01-Sep-22 01:18 AM] allocater#0000
we will support the build-up with loans (and materials)

We are also looking for an AML operator to produce BOS and ZR. A-fabs will be provided.


[01-Sep-22 03:02 AM] balbar#0000
SPF is still a bit overwhelming, but AML sounds interesting.


[01-Sep-22 11:23 AM] allocater#0000
yup that's more entry friendly


[01-Sep-22 11:34 AM] balbar#0000
the best place for it would be hephaestus, right? don't have anything over there yet, so making a manufacturing base would be nice. Biggest issue i have is money..no building a new base with 100k, especially not engineer level😅


[01-Sep-22 11:45 AM] allocater#0000
chemestry bonus would be on griffonstone, destination is hephaestus, BOR and ZIR comes from ?, so up to you where you would place it


[01-Sep-22 11:48 AM] allocater#0000
heph also has no free engineers anymore, so it would operate with techs only for a while

So I just had my first GEN roll off the production line at my GFs on Deimos! 

Since I'm not all that involved with ship building I'm asking here what to do with it? Should I keep it stored in a warehouse on Heph until someone needs it? Also how often do we need GEN, I have the inputs ready to make more, just need an idea of how often to make it

{Reactions}

[01-Sep-22 11:57 AM] allocater#0000
depends where the next STL ship is ordered, could be for ANT1 or ANT2 or a completely different system, so you can keep it where it is for the time being


[01-Sep-22 12:02 PM] allocater#0000
as for when that happens, not sure, we can also restart advertisment for STL ships


[01-Sep-22 12:03 PM] allocater#0000
you can also put 1 GEN on the CX just in case


[01-Sep-22 12:03 PM] balbar#0000
yeah, griffonstone makes more sense in that case


[01-Sep-22 12:12 PM] balbar#0000
oof..about 1,3M just for the minimum (CX price)...engineer stuff is EXPENSIVE


[01-Sep-22 12:16 PM] allocater#0000
you can create a shopping list and see what you can buy from the corp-sheet, the A-fabs for 3 AML come from @dersix, the corp account will pay for them, and you can earn about 50k per day by selling BOS and ZR to insensless. I caclulated 2000/BOS und 6000/ZR should do it


[01-Sep-22 12:18 PM] balbar#0000
alright, I'll check

[01-Sep-22 02:29 PM] churavis#0000
I have no idea where he got it from, he just had a massive amount of it in stock that hasn't yet run out.
I suspect that Earthling likely had an outpost somewhere


[01-Sep-22 02:30 PM] churavis#0000
ZDLR put a buy order up in hopes of stimulating demand but no bites yet

[01-Sep-22 02:57 PM] churavis#0000
You're probably right. DLR will send you a contract when he can


[01-Sep-22 03:03 PM] balbar#0000
perfect. anyway i will nedd 2 or 3 days to set up


[02-Sep-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
so we've had a lot of conversations about shipping issues: basically, moving crops from Demeter or Harmonia to Nascent or the FP planet and presumably the C and RATs.  Should we maybe target building a ship for each of those planets over the next few weeks for each governor and have them run a standard route back and forth?


[02-Sep-22 12:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
One issue would be if we lose a player, we lose the ship since it can't be transferred or sold.  Plus it may not be sufficient to meet demand and would be an unwise investment of capital.  But it seems worth discussing?


[02-Sep-22 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
Shipping has been the main impediment to me starting a base on Nascent


[02-Sep-22 12:42 PM] allocater#0000
I would totally be up for buying a ship with bank money and giving it to someone who will operate it on a good route


[02-Sep-22 12:43 PM] churavis#0000
If we spread the ships out to add many long term, dedicated members then it mitigates to risk of losing the ship


[02-Sep-22 12:49 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, we're getting wealthy and large enough that it probably wouldn't be catastrophic to lose it, but it would mean players accepting one need to know they can't walk away a week later.  Not never, but don't take it if you're waffling!


[02-Sep-22 12:50 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we'd have to figure out how to fairly divide the capacity as well.  If it's flying the dedicated route, it can probably take care of a lot of the demand, but we don't want a couple players moving 100s of tons and others totally crowded out.  Not sure how to solve that!


[02-Sep-22 12:56 PM] churavis#0000
I think we make the ship, have it run the route and if there's not enough shipping capacity then we increase the speed or make another ship.


[02-Sep-22 01:00 PM] churavis#0000
I'm thinking we start with a 2k/2k going Demeter -> Nascent -> Deimos -> Demeter


[02-Sep-22 01:01 PM] churavis#0000
If that's not enough then we add a 1k/3k to do the Demeter -> Deimos portion


[02-Sep-22 01:01 PM] allocater#0000
harmonia -> nascent -> deimos -> harmonia would be a faster start, but depends where the most crops pile up, harmonia or demeter


[02-Sep-22 01:03 PM] churavis#0000
I don't know about anyone else but my Harmonia base is going to be busy enough sending crops and water to YK-649B for RAT/DW/CAF


[02-Sep-22 01:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
my vision would be all 4 of those governors eventually get ships, but definitely Nascent and YK to start, since they have the most input demand


[02-Sep-22 03:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Also, I'm standing up an SPF to help Insensless, so hopefully that gap will be filled soon on Heph

I had someone DM me on discord asking about ship construction. I sent him to @allocater . But since he's bounced around through a couple OOG member's DMs already, he asked about having a public discord channel where non-members can ask about buying ships. Not sure what you all think about that. I know we had a survey question about it, but I didn't really understand the value of that until now.


[07-Sep-22 05:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
We could do a google form like the Galactic Trade Union has (GTU)


[07-Sep-22 05:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But I’m open to an affiliate discord channel, I just don’t want them getting corp pricing, etc.


[07-Sep-22 05:04 PM] churavis#0000
The problem with an affiliate discord channel is that we'd have to manually invite everyone.


[07-Sep-22 05:06 PM] exeler#0000
We could make a dedicated webpage/site for it?

Could be a fun weekend project.


[07-Sep-22 05:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Be nice if Discord supported a static page like that


[07-Sep-22 05:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Could the discord be open access but everything except the "public" channel require the "OOG Member" role?


[07-Sep-22 05:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not deep enough into discord to have a sense of the consequences of that, but I think I've seen channels run that way, particularly for Eve online

What exactly do we want this site/form to do?


[07-Sep-22 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the issue is that people want to have a conversation about ordering a ship, so a form might not do it.

especially if the form is just "here's my discord ID, message me about a ship", which is sort of what is going on already, just without the burden of someone having to check the form responses every day


[07-Sep-22 06:04 PM] churavis#0000
We ought to just build the packages and then hold auctions for them to ensure we get the most money and sell to whoever needs it the most

[07-Sep-22 06:15 PM] exeler#0000
Ooh, a regularly scheduled ship auction sounds like a fun idea.


[07-Sep-22 06:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
A form sends the responses to someone proactively, so the recipient doesn’t have to monitor a discord channel and revamp any server permissions. We could put info on pricing or auctions on that page


[08-Sep-22 02:46 AM] allocater#0000
@domicius you can put up all ads for the VCB ship on heph (give it 5d)


[08-Sep-22 02:47 AM] _bojidar#0000
What is VCB ship? 🙂


[08-Sep-22 02:48 AM] allocater#0000
one with big volume for gas transports


[08-Sep-22 02:49 AM] _bojidar#0000
It's an upgrade of basic ship or else?


[08-Sep-22 02:51 AM] allocater#0000
can be an upgrade, but we are building 2 from scratch this time


[08-Sep-22 02:51 AM] allocater#0000
upgrade is probably inefficient since it replaces almost anything anyway


[08-Sep-22 02:51 AM] _bojidar#0000
I need to be able to transport more gases:)

{Reactions}
🙂 

[08-Sep-22 02:52 AM] allocater#0000
for 500k you could double volume from 500 to 1000. to upgrade to 2000 and 3000 we have not calculated yet, but will be 1mil+


[08-Sep-22 02:57 AM] _bojidar#0000
How much is a such new ship then? 🙂 so I start saving from breakfasts


[08-Sep-22 03:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
VCB is so much more expensive than WCB?😅 How much is the full LCB upgrade? I want to upgrade one to transport crops and water.I guess it's about adding 100k to WCB.


[08-Sep-22 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
2k/2k is 1m and 1k/3k is 500k, I think


[08-Sep-22 05:40 AM] namthorn#0000
WCB doesn't require replacing crew quarters so makes perfect sense for upgrades to starter ships. VCB requires you add a CQL and LCB requires CQM which really adds to the costs

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[08-Sep-22 06:26 AM] _bojidar#0000
Is it possible to get 3000m3/1000t upgrade then for gasses transport as well?


[08-Sep-22 06:30 AM] rune_242#0000
yes, but it is not worth it


[08-Sep-22 06:31 AM] rune_242#0000
you would be better of building a new ship with a VCB


[08-Sep-22 06:32 AM] _bojidar#0000
I see..its weird to easier upgrade t but not m3


[08-Sep-22 06:59 AM] jackinabox86#0000
The argument is that to ship volume requires more material because it needs to enclose a larger space. Tonnage can be dense and require less material to enclose such a storage area. Evidently propulsion is cheap in this world


[08-Sep-22 09:07 AM] namthorn#0000
Nah it's just that AIC/NCC etc are probably abstracted currencies, given that 1 RAT (~50-80 AIC on the open market) is in the ballpark of a million kcal of food assuming decent nutritional value. so that extra STL fuel used for takeoff of a 3kt hauler is a lot more expensive than you might think!


[08-Sep-22 09:52 AM] jackinabox86#0000
intruiging!  I guess what I meant by cheap propulsion was that the engine require to accelerate heavy tonnage is cheap comparatively to the price of needed materials for more volume.  Doesn't make sense to me, but that's PrUn for you


[08-Sep-22 11:09 AM] allocater#0000
yup, 1 package is available


[08-Sep-22 11:10 AM] allocater#0000

oof


[10-Sep-22 12:33 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But yes, I’ve been asking for a bp pricing tool for a while, but there hasn’t been one from the community


[10-Sep-22 12:33 PM] seraphx2#0000
maybe i could add something to FIO UI?


[10-Sep-22 12:34 PM] jackinabox86#0000
@archielvahr did some great work on figuring out how changing a component changes the BP, but it isn’t an easy problem to solve, so someone would have to manually figure out the inputs for a given BP. Matching those inputs to prices is the easy part


[10-Sep-22 12:34 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don’t know that it make sense as part of FIO, but it would be a great tool wherever


[10-Sep-22 12:34 PM] seraphx2#0000
yeah. i figured


[10-Sep-22 12:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Pricing info would be hard bc the market is so inefficient and small, but we could easily do it in-corp given our prices


[10-Sep-22 12:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
The tool could allow you to put in your own prices per component if desired


[10-Sep-22 12:35 PM] seraphx2#0000
i was thinking about if it should be a ship builder or simply a material calculator since i figured you'd have to manually figure out the materials


[10-Sep-22 12:36 PM] seraphx2#0000
a price calc could always precede a builder.


[10-Sep-22 12:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
In my mind, it would mirror the in game bp screen, just output prices as well


[10-Sep-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
You’d want to skip all the special plates, etc


[10-Sep-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Just change cargo bay and common engines


[10-Sep-22 12:37 PM] seraphx2#0000
actually, PMMG supports like custom google sheets with prices right?


[10-Sep-22 12:37 PM] seraphx2#0000
i'll have to talk to PiBoy about that


[10-Sep-22 12:38 PM] seraphx2#0000
it could be just as easily as not making a standalone tool, but modifying the BP editor buffer to show it with PMMG Extended


[10-Sep-22 12:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think we really have a detailed component price list, that's the first step. Then we can price out pre-made packs. It's definitely hard to make a general purpose spreadsheet that replicates the BLU buffer... but there is a extension that gives you price info in a tooltip when you mouse over a material.


[10-Sep-22 12:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Allocator just put most of the prices above in this channel


[10-Sep-22 12:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh thanks, missed that.


[10-Sep-22 12:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we could figure out the few remaining prices quite quickly, for internal use

[15-Sep-22 05:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I’d buy 300 or so HE. The occasional BHP would be good for legacy repairs if that isn’t happening from our other producers


[15-Sep-22 05:33 PM] exeler#0000
Send me a contract for whatever price you think is fair for the HE. It's all on ANT right now, could probably transport it somewhere else if given some time. 

I honestly haven't done the math on it yet.

atm we are 1000 LHP behind, but longterm the requirement is only 20 LHP per day. BHP is just for occasional uprade and repair, maybe 10 / day

@Shipwright will let you know where to send contracts, etc. and if there is a wait for anything.  After that, you get it all to Heph or Deimos and build away


[22-Sep-22 11:17 AM] emperyan11#0000
Perfect! Deimos will be optimal if there are local producers. But I will ship of course if required 😀


[22-Sep-22 11:27 AM] jackinabox86#0000

Bumping the FTL tank is cheap one cause it doesn't add another emitter, so you just gotta buy the MFL, which I'd guess to be 80k-100k in corp. Not sure who makes them though.

[25-Sep-22 09:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
if you bump up the STL tank you need to add a large emitter (and it discards the small and medium emitters). But it improves FTL efficiency


[25-Sep-22 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
incidentally, I'm considering making LFEs, but I wanted to ask if our shipbuilding industry needs more of them.


[25-Sep-22 10:01 AM] _bojidar#0000
How much is that increase on ftl?


[25-Sep-22 10:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
well i'm glad you asked

[25-Sep-22 10:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
(Left side is small cargo bay, the starter ship exactly. 2 small 3 medium field emitters. Right side is adding the med STL to the starter ship, ends up with 1 small, 1 large emitter)


[25-Sep-22 10:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
So charge time goes down 45%.. but as far as actual flight improvement, it kind of varies


[25-Sep-22 10:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
those two ships flying from harmonia to nike (my most common flight path): Goes from 29 FF used in 26 hours on the starter to 16 FF used in 20.5 hours. But the SF cost increases a bit cutting that fuel savings down from ~50% to like 25%


[25-Sep-22 10:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess that's due to the extra mass, or the vagaries of STL flight and orbits.

Those are the inputs he needs to make your crew module and bridge. Not sure what he has access to and doesn’t. Each of us who have different roles are supposed to source what we need for our pieces

Yuen just got the ship, there is one STL waiting for SCB, so we are good to go for the next ship, just missing FSE and a few LHP


[27-Sep-22 12:30 PM] rune_242#0000
are BHP also available?


[27-Sep-22 12:31 PM] allocater#0000
all depleted, unless there are some on deimos


[27-Sep-22 03:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
my next FSE is done in roughly 5 days


[27-Sep-22 03:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
will be a bit faster if I can get more engineers on Heph


[27-Sep-22 04:16 PM] insensless72#0000
There are several buildings that will need to be taken over by someone else in my absence to keep the assembly line flowing. Newer members, this is a great opportunity for you to get involved in the ship building game:
5 ASMs
1 SKF * Most important (will require ASM support)
2 HWP (one each for Yang and I) 
TIO extraction and smelting (401b is a great option)


[27-Sep-22 04:39 PM] exeler#0000
I already do a lot of TI smelting, so adding TIO extraction seems like a very straightforward expansion for me. 

I was also already planning on either expanding my existing metallurgy base (currently just 100% SME on Deimos) or building a second base for the higher tier stuff, so I'm very interested in picking up the ASM, HWP, and SKF


[27-Sep-22 04:44 PM] churavis#0000
I don't know that we want just one person to have all the HWP and ASM


[27-Sep-22 04:49 PM] exeler#0000
That's fair, but at the same time who's stopping me from building them?

I just renewed my pro for 6 months so I'll be around for a while.


[27-Sep-22 05:54 PM] exeler#0000
Playing around with this in PRUNer It looks like the SKF requires a lot more materials than 5 ASM provide, I'm guessing it stays idle mostly because the demand for the SKF components is pretty low? If I'm, understanding things right, the SKF only need to make 3 things (A cargo bay, an ftl tank, and an stl tank) per ship that is built.

Unless we're selling a new ship every 2 days, then there's no point in trying to keep it running 24/7 and letting the ASM output limit the throughput of the SKF is fine?


[27-Sep-22 06:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I’d probably build one ASM so I could supply what I need for the FSE at the SPF. Maybe that will help lighten the load. If the ship builders who have demand take some of the ASM demand versus just one player?


[27-Sep-22 07:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I've confirmed I can build an ASM at my base on Deimos and fulfill what I need for the SPF (60 FAL every 5 days).  So we're looking for 4 max now, I think


[27-Sep-22 07:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
In view of insensless's departure, and my capacity is sufficient (2WCB+1LCB), I will gradually establish a production line capable of producing 38 to 48Ti per day, and establish ASM.


[27-Sep-22 11:08 PM] exeler#0000
I just did some planning in PRUNer and it looks like I could swap some space on my Deimos base for 2 HWP and make enough AL and STL on planet to keep it making BHP non-stop. I'd have to find some of the more exotic materials for the other advanced plates, but I imagine the demand for those is sporadic.

I'd definitely want to make sure that there was some demand for the BHP before I started making them since the AL/TI output from my SME is the vast majority of my income. That should hopefully change soon once I my PG/EPO production on Griffonstone gets up to speed

I was also planning on building a base on ZV-759b (FEO planet right next to Deimos) for the higher tier metallurgy stuff, but it looks like pop might be a big problem there so I'd probably be better off moving/building SME to there and putting the fancy stuff on Deimos.


[27-Sep-22 11:17 PM] exeler#0000
If nobody has any strong objections, I'm going to get things together and hopefully have two HWP up and running on Deimos by the weekend. I'll be out of the TI game until I find time and capital to get a base on ZV-759b running for some more SME capacity.


[28-Sep-22 12:09 AM] churavis#0000
Most of my FE went to Insenseless so I'm sure I'll be able to provide a lot of the FE you need


[28-Sep-22 08:56 AM] jackinabox86#0000
We use a lot more LHP than BHP, so it's a bit cheaper to produce.  Can't speak to demand, but at the moment, it's in backlog, so I bet you'd be producing for a while before we had excess


[28-Sep-22 08:56 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if nothing else, I'll buy 80 or so to upgrade my starter ships


[28-Sep-22 08:57 AM] jackinabox86#0000
plus I want to do another stl ship asap and that's 40 or so


[28-Sep-22 10:16 AM] exeler#0000
That's good to know, I was playing with the numbers and it looks like I can make the BHP pretty economically. The current prices on the CX give me a healthy profit. I'm guessing LHP are similar since the recipe is not too different. Haven't checked specifically yet though.


[28-Sep-22 10:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You just save 200u per LHP since it doesn't require STL


[28-Sep-22 10:37 AM] jackinabox86#0000
simpler supply chain, higher profit, higher demand (in-corp at least)


[28-Sep-22 10:47 AM] jackinabox86#0000
@Deleted User what are you missing for Emperyan's stl bridge and crew quarters?  I'm going to be looking to acquire those very soon and want to know what the backlog is and how we can get them built asap


[28-Sep-22 11:22 AM] churavis#0000
I can supply the plastics for now but I don't have enough excess PPF capacity to fill the hole left by Insensless, someone else is going to need to build more PPF


[28-Sep-22 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Production for his parts are underway, I would need 20 PSM 12 PSL and one BMF.

I think Churaviis and Allocater can run those.


[28-Sep-22 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Your wait will be mostly because of production times on BR1


[28-Sep-22 07:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to build two PPF. If you are in a hurry, I can build this one first.


[28-Sep-22 07:56 PM] churavis#0000
I sent him the plastics he needs already


[29-Sep-22 08:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
got a request from a random for a quote on a LFE and a WCB.  We probably can't do the WCB right now given our ASM/SKF issues?  But an LFE would be 200k?


[29-Sep-22 09:37 AM] allocater#0000
yup, and WCB we can do 400k that's how we bought it 😄


[29-Sep-22 09:48 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Cool. Made the offer.


[29-Sep-22 02:29 PM] allocater#0000
lots of products to get into now:

DEC 10k

LCB 350k
WCB 350k
MSL
MFL
FET 1k
AST 1k
FAL 1k
LHP 1.5k
BHP 1.7k

[29-Sep-22 02:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
what's our demand for DEC?


[29-Sep-22 02:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Also, I should be able to meet the FAL demand.  Can put an additional ASM on Deimos before the next POPR.  I meet my own demand and I can cover enough excess for the SCB and CQS input needs


[29-Sep-22 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have AUO on the CX. I also have 500+ HCC on Griff, if that's what the gold is for.


[29-Sep-22 03:19 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I use AU occasionally for the BGO for QCR.  If you ever want to make that instead of RGO->HCC, I'm happy to buy it and save you a step and PE.  I can do it, but it's not my favorite part of my QCR chain


[29-Sep-22 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mostly just make the HCC so I don't have to ship such heavy gold 😄


[29-Sep-22 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think QJ-650c would support shipbuilding buildings


[29-Sep-22 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I'll pass, hehe


[29-Sep-22 03:45 PM] exeler#0000
I just built a super POL heavy base on griffonstone so I should be able to make quite a bit of DEC. 

I currently have the base set up to run 8X orders for PG and EPO with a single DEC order. I'll have to check PRUNer or FIO for the exact output this gives me, but I set it up this way to make a lot of extra PG and EPO. If there's a lot of demand for DEC though I don't mind balancing it more, even to the point where I only sell DEC.

{Reactions}
🎉 

[29-Sep-22 08:02 PM] exeler#0000
Looks like if I go for maximum self sustainable DEC production I can do ~8 per day

If I go nuts and buy all the PG and EPO I can crank out a cool 48 DEC a day, but that's probably the equivalent of saying "I can make a ton of C with my base full of INC, just gotta buy the crops" since I'd need 7.2k PG and 3.3k EPO per day and the CX has no where near that amount available.


[30-Sep-22 01:42 AM] allocater#0000
that would be 2 per day for WhosRodrix


[30-Sep-22 08:24 AM] balbar#0000
now that insensless is leaving is anyone taking over the Fuel tank production? basically, who should i send the ZR to now?


[30-Sep-22 08:29 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I think Exeler was going to build the SKF?


[30-Sep-22 09:00 AM] balbar#0000
alright, I will for now stockpile the ZR on deimos


[30-Sep-22 10:11 AM] exeler#0000
I was planning on picking up just the HWP for now. 

I eventually want to get into SKF and building some ASM, but that's going to be a little bit of a longer term goal since I don't have a solid plan for sourcing the inputs.


[30-Sep-22 10:13 AM] allocater#0000
you will be spammed with TI like Insensless, what other inputs are hard?


[30-Sep-22 10:14 AM] exeler#0000
That's the main one. Just I thought I was part of the TI spamming club, but I'm going to be swapping to AL to feed the HWP


[30-Sep-22 10:58 AM] jackinabox86#0000
so basically, we need someone to run 3-4 ASMs and someone to run a SKF

both Churavis and I need SCB/SSL, so getting that before you leave would be great.  If not, just let us know so we can figure something out.


[01-Oct-22 01:04 PM] insensless72#0000
SSL wont be a problem, SCB will as FAL take 2 days to make 30, 50 per SCB


[01-Oct-22 01:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000

We seem to be going hog wild building ASMs at the moment, so I wanted to calculate how many we actually need.  I went through the ship recipe list to see how much FAL, AST, FET, WAL, and CTF is needed to build one ftl and one stl ship every five days (the rate I believe we target).  Looks like it is 7.25.  I've got one doing FAL for FSE and can do another to do FAL for the SCB, but happy to let someone else do one.   We probably need 6 total other ones for AST/FET/WAL/CTF.  Who has them or is planning on doing them?

I calculated the build time at 80% efficiency with both techs and engineers staffed, COGC bonus applied, but no experts.

[03-Oct-22 01:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
My revised plan is 2 ASM and a bunch of SME on Deimos.


[03-Oct-22 01:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Let's do a reminder ping to everyone in #general to update the planet sheet. And then we consider moving the shipbuilding sheet to that main "Ooga Booga Corporate Production" workbook.


[03-Oct-22 01:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000

[03-Oct-22 08:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
I plan to build 3ASM . Considering that I have SKF, it's more convenient. When I finish Griffonstone, I'll build Ti +0 base.


[03-Oct-22 09:15 PM] jackinabox86#0000
So basically, we may be short one ASM.  Not terrible


[03-Oct-22 09:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main problem now is that the technicians and engineers of new buildings need time to replenish, and the supply chain and consumables inventory need time to improve.


[03-Oct-22 09:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
Thanks to Insensless and Pokter, we have building materials and production materials to survive the transition period that should have been long.👍


[03-Oct-22 09:52 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Techs are in decent supply I think, so it’s not terrible. Not like trying to get engineers on Heph was

I will set up a base of Ti, Tco and O in se-648c. After it is built, about 300 to 400 O per day should be enough for all members of Corp, but I need to set up a base of Griffstone to build TNP first.

[04-Oct-22 01:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
All the materials are basically ready, except more than 20 HSE, but I can build it myself after my base is built.


[04-Oct-22 01:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest trouble is that the capacity is not enough, and then the infrastructure of the planet is not enough, so I may not expand such a large capacity from the beginning.


[04-Oct-22 01:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
Of course, when the time comes, you are more welcome to go there and get O directly.


[04-Oct-22 01:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
It is more appropriate to use LBC to transport O.

Allocater already hooked me up from our stores.  I think @churavis may have what he needs, and if so, you should just sell to @Shipwright for your usual fee so we can sell it to the next stl ship buyer

How much is it?

FTL ship is standard like starter ship or else?


[06-Oct-22 09:59 AM] jackinabox86#0000
It's a 2000m/2000t hauler with an FSE and QCR.  3.5m for corp members


[06-Oct-22 09:59 AM] jackinabox86#0000
you can pay 100k less for the 1000m/3000t version or 400k more for the 3000m/1000t version


[06-Oct-22 10:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
I really want to use it to transport O, but I have no money. It's a pity.😅


[06-Oct-22 10:00 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it's wild how much one has to pay in this game to ship cheap shit like O or H


[06-Oct-22 10:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
Crops need LBC, water needs LBC, and O needs LBC, which is terrible.


[06-Oct-22 10:01 AM] churavis#0000
When a material is desperately needed and in short supply then it is not cheap shit

[06-Oct-22 10:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
Even if 100AIC is an O, a ship of LBC is worth 170k, which is not very high, but it is definitely not low.


[06-Oct-22 10:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
Of course, it can't compare with dw's over 100k.


[06-Oct-22 10:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if you bring that much, you're going to crash the price


[06-Oct-22 10:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
which is fine, but you just have to account for that


[06-Oct-22 10:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it would take a few months to pay off the ship, which seems long to me


[06-Oct-22 10:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
Except dw, LBC's profit is not high whether it serves crops or anything else.  Even if the discount is half, the profit of one day will be 60k. It will take about two months. This is just a public product, and I have plenty of other high-profit industries to do.


[06-Oct-22 10:15 AM] jackinabox86#0000
sure, I'm not commenting on your plans.  I just think game design wise, there should be more of a connection between cost/purpose of ship and the likely value of a load of those goods


[06-Oct-22 10:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
as it is, you can ship software and drones worth millions in a starter ship very easily, but if you're a new player trying to ship some fuel inputs, you get nailed on capacity very quickly


[06-Oct-22 10:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it doesn't need to be perfect, I just think a bit cheaper entry cost to ships (and then more value later from expensive upgrades) would be an improvement


[06-Oct-22 10:16 AM] churavis#0000
Value is relative in the real world as well


[06-Oct-22 10:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
My software farm only needs a lot of Fim, and I've got enough RFABS. The next step is to buy a lot from HRT or produce it myself. In fact, I've got enough Bfabs to build an FP base . I don't need a new boat for these needs.


[06-Oct-22 10:20 AM] _bojidar#0000
I have half of it now..may I pay other half in longer time then?


[06-Oct-22 12:00 PM] allocater#0000

Yeah, I can probably make use of yours in the mean time, but I’m going to be moving PWO, DW, RAT, OVE, REP, COF, and more… that’s a lot of contracts, and I need precise timing in a lot of cases to get deliveries to the FTL taking it to Deimos, Harm, Nike on time

EXO and PT as well...
and I need to make the connection with my big hauler going to Etherwind (and Proxion 1x per week) <-> Deimos that's hauling my and Zipatsu's H2O for use in Harmonia. That ship is on a tight timeline that makes 3 trips per week to get everything Zipatsu, Exeler and I need back and forth.


[12-Oct-22 01:43 AM] dehzhas#0000
All-in-all, it's a decent amount of micromanagement and timing I need to hit.

[12-Oct-22 10:55 PM] emperyan11#0000
Or tell me the secret of changing my bridge on the Blueprint buffer... it kinda just selects what it wants based on your drives


[12-Oct-22 10:57 PM] churavis#0000
I could make you a BRS in a few days


[12-Oct-22 10:58 PM] churavis#0000
I will need a BR1 as well, although I don't expect you to just do a straight trade as BR1's are more expensive


[12-Oct-22 10:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, the Short distance bridge is a special case. If you don't have an FTL reactor, it will give you a BRS no matter what else you have selected


[12-Oct-22 10:59 PM] emperyan11#0000
I'll flat out trade you for the BR1 or we can do some horse trading...


[12-Oct-22 11:00 PM] archielvahr#0000

Let me know what you come up with and I'll ship the BR1 to you.
(I'd keep it for future considerations but, really, 4 ships are going to be enough to manage. I don't need a fleet)


[12-Oct-22 11:09 PM] churavis#0000
The BRS will be finished on Nike but once I have an ETA we can see whether it's easier for you or me to ship it

1k/3k is a lot cheaper. Obviously you do you, but one is 500k and the other is millions!


[13-Oct-22 09:28 AM] allocater#0000
yeah if you want 1k-1k it's cheaper to build a new ship, because it's almost the same cost as an upgrade but you end up with 2 ships instead of one

you can buy them off credit


[13-Oct-22 02:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
I already have 1 on credit, so I want to make sure I don't get myself into trouble. I have a planet that will generate 250k per day but requires BL, INS and AEF to build on... so even if I get it on credit, its a matter of timing.


[13-Oct-22 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
BL kind of doesn't exist at the moment.


[13-Oct-22 02:41 PM] churavis#0000
You could also just consolidate your bases to be closer together so you don't need to have your ships tied up in long journeys all the time

250k/day depend on getting 2kt per day off the planet... so unless it happened to be right next door for a single ship to make the trip twice a day... I'll pretty much need 2 ships no matter what I do.


[13-Oct-22 02:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
I also am trying to stack my planets in a couple systems to minimize ship load, but at some point, you need a planet with specific requirements that isn't close.


[13-Oct-22 02:47 PM] churavis#0000
There are all kinds of planets in Antares space, you don't need bases on the other side of the galaxy.


[13-Oct-22 02:48 PM] dehzhas#0000
It was free 🙂


[13-Oct-22 02:49 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have a benefactor that is paying me to be there, paid for the initial base and 15k/week... I'm still on the fence about whether it was worth it.


[13-Oct-22 02:49 PM] dehzhas#0000
he also paid for the STS I need to get on/off the planet


[13-Oct-22 02:50 PM] churavis#0000
Just because you don't pay money doesn't mean it's free


[13-Oct-22 02:50 PM] allocater#0000
in theory expansion should become easier the more ships we build


[13-Oct-22 02:50 PM] allocater#0000
distance becomes less and less a factor


[13-Oct-22 02:50 PM] dehzhas#0000
yeah... my theory is that it's just the initial cost of the ship that is the problem. Once you have it, the ROI becomes very different to maintain it.


[13-Oct-22 02:51 PM] allocater#0000
and everybody can settle the best planets universe wide


[13-Oct-22 02:51 PM] allocater#0000
of course nobody got there yet and probably quits before it happens 😅


[13-Oct-22 02:53 PM] dehzhas#0000
at any rate, I'm building a maxed out base every 3-4 days at the moment, adding a bunch of income each time. I will slow that down eventually, but I don't think I will have a problem affording the ships in a couple weeks.


[13-Oct-22 02:53 PM] rune_242#0000
what are going to make🤯


[13-Oct-22 02:54 PM] dehzhas#0000
2k N per day


[13-Oct-22 02:54 PM] rune_242#0000
is there demand for 2k N a day?


[13-Oct-22 02:54 PM] rune_242#0000
or do you have some sort of special contract


[13-Oct-22 02:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
Across all CX?


[13-Oct-22 02:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
Probably. And I don't have to scale the entire base to full capacity. I can do it incrementally.


[13-Oct-22 02:55 PM] rune_242#0000
I see


[13-Oct-22 02:55 PM] rune_242#0000
do you have a source for your AEF?


[13-Oct-22 02:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
No

We do not have enough PP3 capacity it seems


[13-Oct-22 03:23 PM] rune_242#0000

Wasnt me on that wait list since last week? for ftl


[16-Oct-22 09:23 AM] allocater#0000
yes but CQM is stuck


[16-Oct-22 09:23 AM] churavis#0000
How much do FTL and STL production lines intersect?


[16-Oct-22 09:24 AM] allocater#0000
actually I think you can create the ads already, CQM will come in the next days, hopefully


[16-Oct-22 09:25 AM] allocater#0000
not at all, SKF is idle most of the time and UPF is separated but can be used to speed up one or the other

GEN demand is now 3, you can sell into me on ANT @yjhasaday @churavis


[17-Oct-22 09:18 AM] churavis#0000
I've got one GEN ready in about a day


[17-Oct-22 09:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm finally upgrading my starter ships from the 300 FF tank to 800 FF.  Takes one MFL and one SSC.  Requires 26 hours in the shipyard.  Ridiculous


[17-Oct-22 09:24 AM] _bojidar#0000
Just that? Really


[17-Oct-22 09:24 AM] churavis#0000
I'm guessing the tank is hidden deep in the ship and they have to take apart the whole thing and rearrange it all?


[17-Oct-22 09:24 AM] churavis#0000
That's just bad design, though


[17-Oct-22 09:24 AM] allocater#0000
if you do WCB at the same time you save time!


[17-Oct-22 09:25 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it was previously upgraded to be a 3000/1000 hauler.  I doubt you could upgrade the starter ship clean to have an MFL with just those two mats.  But what do I know


[17-Oct-22 09:25 AM] jackinabox86#0000
and I'm doing it to my other hauler tomorrow.  Out a ship for nearly 3 days.  Might as well retire like everyone else


[17-Oct-22 09:47 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I have 1 GEN on Phobos and 1 ready on Deimos in 30 hours


[17-Oct-22 07:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
My glass boat is just short of Gen. Please give it to me on Phobos and ask ALLocater for money.😆


[17-Oct-22 07:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
The transportation between ANT, Phobos and Heph wastes my capacity too much.😅


[17-Oct-22 08:18 PM] churavis#0000
Who isn't building an Antares I puddlejumper?


[17-Oct-22 08:39 PM] dehzhas#0000

[17-Oct-22 09:09 PM] exeler#0000
Me, I don't have any bases there yet lol


[17-Oct-22 09:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
Heph's yield is not high, while Phobos's threshold is high.


[17-Oct-22 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
From the perspective of income, go to Griff first. Considering the expansion ability, go to Nike first.


[17-Oct-22 09:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
BMP takes up too much capacity. I'm thinking of tearing down a few and changing the rest into WPL.


[17-Oct-22 09:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
The yield of wpl is also very low, but at least the capacity consumption is low.


[17-Oct-22 09:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
I recalculated it. If BMP produces OVE, REP, PWO and the like, the rate of return is good. At the same time, the capacity consumption is not large. but the market is easy to saturate, so it is necessary to frequently switch production types and manage inventory, which is suitable for people with few bases.


[17-Oct-22 10:23 PM] balbar#0000
I'd like to order another WCB-upgrade kit. I'm really starting to get limited by shipping capacity


[17-Oct-22 10:48 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Sent you a contract, I'll get payment from @allocater


[18-Oct-22 01:02 AM] yuen8241#0000

I have a GEN on Phobos when needed 🙂


[21-Oct-22 10:40 AM] allocater#0000
always, then we can build another STL ship, I buy 5 on the CX


[21-Oct-22 05:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have 3 NOZ and 2 CHA, would those be useful for ship building?


[21-Oct-22 06:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I use them.  Would shorten the production time a bit on the next FSE


[21-Oct-22 06:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I wouldn't go out of your way to make them again given we're keeping well up with demand on engines, but I'll buy them


[21-Oct-22 06:21 PM] dehzhas#0000
I don't make them, I just picked them up off a everything-must-go fire sale, so I got them for almost free. I'm happy to pass them on for free at Deimos or you can pay me to pay @archielvahr to ship them to ANT since he has a ship going that way.


[21-Oct-22 06:24 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I’m happy to pay whatever you paid for them or whatever you want. Just shoot me a contract at Deimos and I can ship them on my next run


[21-Oct-22 06:28 PM] dehzhas#0000

[21-Oct-22 08:14 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Must have been a nice garage sale.  Those prices are silly low!


[23-Oct-22 12:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm interested in a new FTL ship, whenever we next one we have available. I have my own LFEs 😉 (unless that's logistically annoying)


[23-Oct-22 12:29 AM] allocater#0000
so I assume you want a 200k discount then? 😄


[23-Oct-22 09:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Heh, I think the corp rate is 120k 😛 But I won't talk you out of it


[23-Oct-22 09:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I just sold one in Benten at 200k, so I'm flying high 😎


[24-Oct-22 01:50 PM] domicius#0000
Can I please get upgrades to my 2 basic ships?


[24-Oct-22 03:34 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I, too, am interested in this if we have good stock on the necessary parts


[24-Oct-22 03:52 PM] optitronic#0000
It'd be great to get some fuel efficient engines installed.


[24-Oct-22 07:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Almost always better to just build a second ship than upgrade an engine, but we can make whatever is needed


[25-Oct-22 05:34 AM] domicius#0000
Yes but can I have 2 larger cargo holds please?


[25-Oct-22 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
We usually upgrade to WCB.


[25-Oct-22 06:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
I just built one, and it will be finished after 5 hours in Deimos.


[25-Oct-22 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you need more FET for WCBs, just let me know Yuen. I can make it, I will just need a bit of FEO or FE on Deimos.


[25-Oct-22 09:27 AM] churavis#0000
I've got 12 FEO and 51 FE on Deimos with more on the way


[25-Oct-22 10:12 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hi all, I need some re-supply for GEN, current production is halted. @rune_242 I believe I bought GV from you the last time? Let me know if I'm wrong.

The other material I'm out of is LFP, I used to buy it from Insensless - does anyone else make it now?


[25-Oct-22 10:13 AM] rune_242#0000
That's right, I kept 100 in stock for this.


[25-Oct-22 10:14 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sweet, what is your price? Do you use it for anything or can I buy it all?


[25-Oct-22 10:16 AM] rune_242#0000
it's just for you!


[25-Oct-22 10:17 AM] rune_242#0000
would 700/u be ok?


[25-Oct-22 10:18 AM] rune_242#0000
wow AL is really high from since the last time I checked


[25-Oct-22 10:19 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I do LFP, but I'm waiting on THF from Allocater


[25-Oct-22 10:20 AM] jackinabox86#0000
happy to overproduce beyond my needs for you.  I also do GV, which you can ping me about when you run out of Rune's stock


[25-Oct-22 10:21 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Thanks! sent you a contract, threw in an extra 5 g's since you mentioned AL is high 😁


[25-Oct-22 10:21 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sounds good, appreciate it. Let me know when you have some LFP - where do you make it?


[25-Oct-22 10:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Heph.  I have 4 extra I could sell you now if helpful


[25-Oct-22 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sending you 20 THF at ANT. I just made some to use up my NA.  😄


[25-Oct-22 10:28 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I'll need a couple days before I get to that point of the GEN build. So take your time, maybe you can get some THF before then and I can buy some more off you when the time comes


[26-Oct-22 05:58 AM] domicius#0000
So, about upgrading my current 500/500s...


[26-Oct-22 05:58 AM] domicius#0000
Can I go on the list?


[26-Oct-22 09:04 AM] allocater#0000
we have 5 upgrade packs

so you can create ads for it on heph


[26-Oct-22 09:06 AM] allocater#0000
if you want, you can become main THF supplier, I only have 1 decayed LAB on griff which is only visited twice per months 😅

or in other words: 2 ships per week


[27-Oct-22 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don’t know how to input this on the sheet, so I’m going to say it here. Unfortunately no I don’t think I’ll be able to. School has been ramping up quite a lot and I BARELY find time to add more recipes to my production lines. I’m minimizing everything I do on PrUn because if I take any big responsibilities, I’ll be holding anyone who depends on it back.


[27-Oct-22 03:59 PM] allocater#0000
that's ok, no worries

{Reactions}
this 

[27-Oct-22 04:14 PM] exeler#0000
If I'm reading this right, it's 91 LHP (or BHP) to make a new ship?

I currently make enough LHP or BHP to build a new ship every 3 days, with 30 extra for covering other demand like repairs for existing ships. I do this pretty comfortably as I produce most of the components myself and mostly only need to buy basic resources like ALO and H2O in addition to consumables.

I could also ramp this up another 50% if needed, but it'll take a couple weeks to get the plans and supplies together.

[27-Oct-22 04:28 PM] namthorn#0000

I can't find my stuff, but I *can* scale up 50pc more.


[27-Oct-22 05:12 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Do you want to step back on doing your stuff or just commit to a level you can sustain so we can line up support?


[27-Oct-22 05:12 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I can get more engines. Let me know how many we need and I’ll produce them

GEN excluded of course


[27-Oct-22 05:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have just 2 UPF so not a big deal but inputs is the main limitation


[27-Oct-22 05:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, it’s the inputs that matter, not the building, so if you need to hand off supporting one UPF or something, let us know.


[28-Oct-22 01:38 AM] rune_242#0000
I think all the PG we will need is going to be a big issue

that was why i suddenly needed the C for heph. I tried to ship it via contract from the CX, but unfortunately it was accepted by KingJams...


[28-Oct-22 01:56 AM] balbar#0000
That reminds me, does anyone know how often you can extend a contract? As long as I don't let it breach he can't do anything with it..just taking up space


[28-Oct-22 02:00 AM] allocater#0000
I think it's infinite


[28-Oct-22 02:01 AM] allocater#0000
maybe you can blackmail him, so he has to pay you to release it 😄


[28-Oct-22 02:01 AM] balbar#0000
I'll wait and see. 🙂


[28-Oct-22 02:02 AM] balbar#0000

[28-Oct-22 02:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have a lot of C's in harmonia. I have moved PG to benten, and I can't use them for a while. If your C is short, I can share it with you.


[28-Oct-22 02:16 AM] balbar#0000
I got plenty from allocator, so I'm good right now. Thank you for the offer though


[28-Oct-22 02:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
PE, PG is a monster that devours C.  I used to have 8 BMPs to make PE, and the consumption of C was terrible.😅


[28-Oct-22 02:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
Benten's C supply is very stable, and the chemical and manufacturing planet is even in CX galaxy, which is very convenient.


[28-Oct-22 02:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
If PG production is put in Umbra, Griff's space can be saved to produce EPO or DDT.


[28-Oct-22 02:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
I've built a base there, so it's much more convenient to supply if someone is with me.😆


[28-Oct-22 05:56 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I’ve got a PG base on Electronica that is producing 4k PG a day. Going to phase down to add in some EPO soon, but there’s lots of options if PG is needed

[29-Oct-22 02:12 AM] allocater#0000
now I am wondering, why not build a copy of that base on nascent as well


[29-Oct-22 02:17 AM] exeler#0000
That's what I've been thinking. The H2O and NS are really easy to ship. I was thinking about separating the HYF from the INC to stack experts better, but then that introduces a lot more shipping for input.

If the C can be sold/used on-site then it works out really well. Otherwise shipping the C off planet is a struggle even if supplying the inputs is relatively easy.

I've got some more thinking to do, but it might make sense to stamp these out in places where large quantities of C are used since it doesn't depend on fertility. Then the fertile planets can focus on GRN and other crops that the HYF can't produce.

I wonder if a similar template could work for FP and RATs 🤔 Although, shipping with RAT isn't nearly as much of a concern as it is with C right?


[29-Oct-22 02:19 AM] allocater#0000
yeah RAT is really light. 
It is pretty neat to dump water and NS on a planet and get a C fountain 😄


[29-Oct-22 02:21 AM] exeler#0000
If the price of C were to drop back to around 300 or so, I think it becomes cheaper to buy the C and ship it than it does to maintain that base, but if shipping capacity is tight it could still be worthwhile


[29-Oct-22 02:41 AM] exeler#0000
It's also worth noting the setup is super permit-efficient. 170C per day for a single permit on any planet if you can bring GRN in from somewhere. If you don't have GRN you can produce a ton of excess crops or things like CAF

Or, if you balance it differently it looks like you can pull ~120 per day with a 2 INC to 1 HYF ratio with no dependency on GRN and assuming the COGC is some unrelated industry. Just use the HCP/MAI recipe and supply the H2O and NS. 3/3 experts to keep crops and C balanced. If I build another one of these I'm going to do this layout instead. 18INC/9 HYF fits neatly in a single permit. Even when I set the price of C to 300 it's still turning a small profit according to PRUNner.

[03-Nov-22 09:05 AM] jackinabox86#0000
the financing is from Allocater, so it's up to him, but in my mind, if someone finances a ship, they should wait to finance another until everyone who needs one is good.  If there's plenty of supply, great, but I want to make sure the love gets spread around


[03-Nov-22 09:07 AM] _bojidar#0000

Now I wonder if allocater still has that much money. He buys parts from us in cash, but selling boats is a loan.


[03-Nov-22 09:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
Allocater also acts as a bank to supplement liquidity for our members, so if his cash is tight, it will lead to great problems. It is suggested that you pay off the loan of the last boat before queuing. I don't think the number of your bases is so large. Two WBC+ one LBC should be enough.

we already have the precedence that you can have 2 ftl ships on credit, but we can add the rule that one's first credit ship always jumps ahead of a second credit ship.

WCB
LFE
BHPx16
SSCx25


[04-Nov-22 10:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have LFEs, they sell pretty quickly at 195,000 on the CX. I bet we can pad the total a fair bit for a pre-made package.


[04-Nov-22 10:31 PM] yuen8241#0000

In the upgrade package, only LFE has complicated production process and low output.


[04-Nov-22 10:38 PM] exeler#0000
I'm probably going to be in the market for an upgrade package soon. I've been starting to struggle a bit with my shipping with my plain starter ships


[04-Nov-22 10:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
Haven't your two starting ships been upgraded yet?


[04-Nov-22 10:52 PM] exeler#0000
Nope, I'm still operating with the basic ones 😅


[04-Nov-22 10:52 PM] exeler#0000
My bases have been pretty heavily optimized to reduce shipping needs


[04-Nov-22 11:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I still only run the two starter ships too  and they spend quite a bit of time idle. I bulk ship AL and C using shipping ads and bases have 25 days of consumables


[05-Nov-22 02:46 AM] allocater#0000
I feel upgrade packs are now simple enough so that we can do them via market. We already control LFE. If yuen undercuts with WCB it's pretty much done since SSC and BHP are already proper markets.

[09-Nov-22 11:04 AM] exeler#0000
One of my future plans is to build a second SME base on A2B and swap some of my SME on Deimos for WEL and FS.


[09-Nov-22 11:56 AM] churavis#0000
Give me some warning so I can build up a stock of HSE


[09-Nov-22 12:10 PM] exeler#0000
My two blockers for doing the base has been finding a source of HSE to build the base and C to run the base. My recent Harmonia base rework solved all my C problems (and created a new one of how  do I get rid of all this extra C?)

I'm still expanding my base on Heph, so I'm not looking to expand another base just yet. Most of my future plans involve hefty amounts of HSE and/or INS though, so if you started making some I will definitely buy it.


[09-Nov-22 12:24 PM] churavis#0000
If you keep selling me burnables on Demeter then I may end up having excess C to sell back to you.


[09-Nov-22 12:36 PM] exeler#0000
Haha, that's the opposite of my current problem. I've got an excess of nearly 100C per day to deal with.


[09-Nov-22 02:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
On Harmonia? I will be building a PG base soon and could use it. Easier to use what is available rather than build a new base for now. Logistics will be ok if I upgrade one of my ships.


[09-Nov-22 02:30 PM] exeler#0000
Yup, I make a ton of C on Harmonia. My margins are slim, but the volume is high 🙂


[09-Nov-22 02:31 PM] exeler#0000
I ship it regularly to my own bases on Deimos, Griffonstone, and soon to be Hephaestus and usually have a stockpile to sell there.


[09-Nov-22 02:47 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I make quite a bit more than I use already, I have 1k on both Harmonia and Deimos, but not enough for a full PG base which takes about 75C/day


[09-Nov-22 03:16 PM] exeler#0000
My Harmonia base churns out ~180 C a day and I use about 80/d across all my other bases


[09-Nov-22 03:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Do you buy the burnables?


[09-Nov-22 04:24 PM] exeler#0000
Only GRN, but I could ship that from my base on Demeter if I wanted.

@churavis might get mad if I suddenly start getting high on my own supply though.

{Reactions}
😠 

[09-Nov-22 04:39 PM] churavis#0000
Honestly, my Demeter base produces enough GRN for my Nascent base to run the slow C recipe, so anything on top of that is what I use to occasionally run faster recipes.


[09-Nov-22 05:00 PM] exeler#0000
How much C does a full INC base running the slow recipe make?

I know it's the most cost effective way to make C, but I haven't looked into volume for that set up much.


[09-Nov-22 05:52 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I do 200 c a day


[09-Nov-22 05:53 PM] jackinabox86#0000
GRN from Demeter and over 20 inc on nascent


[09-Nov-22 06:00 PM] churavis#0000
More importantly than cost, it's the most area efficient if you can't buy massive amounts of burnables

[09-Nov-22 07:38 PM] exeler#0000
The numbers here are assuming some unrelated COGC like Chemistry. If there's an agriculture or resource extraction COGC then the optimal ratio of INC to HYF changes as well.

Heaps of H2O, where do you import it from?


[09-Nov-22 07:40 PM] churavis#0000
Is that area calculation taking into account what you'll need for H2O and NS?


[09-Nov-22 07:42 PM] exeler#0000
Etherwind, I haven't got my own base there so I just buy it from other members who do. A single base there can make more enough H2O for multiple of these.


[09-Nov-22 07:42 PM] exeler#0000
Same story for NS, a single dedicated NS base makes enough NS to supply multiple of these. I was going to build one for myself, but @allocater beat me to it.

Is a 2k/2k upgrade pack a thing? If so, how much would it cost?

it's not, it would cost 2mil+, almost as much as a new ship 😄

🤔 

How much is a brand new 2k/2k exactly?


[18-Nov-22 02:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can do the math yourself. The price is transparent.


[18-Nov-22 02:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
Make a blueprint first, then calculate the total upgrade materials, and then check the corresponding raw material prices from ftl prices.


[18-Nov-22 02:44 AM] rune_242#0000
3.5 mil


[18-Nov-22 02:44 AM] rune_242#0000
you can buy them of credit if you can pay it back in 60 days


[18-Nov-22 02:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
LBC will lead to the need for a lot of other materials, almost completely replacing the old ship, so it is similar to buying a new one.

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[18-Nov-22 02:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you like LBC, I think you can buy a new one and keep the old one as a fast boat. Now I find that I need a boat to transport some very light things.

This is how the upgrade cost is calculated. First, make the target blueprint A, and then use it and your existing blueprint B. The difference is the material you need to provide.


[18-Nov-22 03:04 AM] exeler#0000
Ahh, I was asking about the new ship entirely. Either way, a lot of the ship components are hard to find prices for. Like how much does a BR1 cost? or a CQM? Do I just go off of the historical data on the CX from the one time the thing was sold publicly?


[18-Nov-22 03:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, the price of parts of ships fluctuates greatly.


[18-Nov-22 03:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now I produce cargo hold, fuel hold, command hold and crew hold. I can produce  the whole process of cargo hold by myself . Others need many parts produced by allocator and chemical raw materials provided by balbar.


[18-Nov-22 03:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
Because many internal prices are mixed, the price of Corp can't truly reflect the actual price.


[18-Nov-22 03:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
If our output increases, I think we can consider auctioning some boats.


[18-Nov-22 03:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
WBC upgrade package is also a good choice. The core components are WBC and LFE.


[18-Nov-22 03:18 AM] exeler#0000
I think something like is what I'd like to get, depending on how expensive it might be 😅

As long as it is repaired regularly, LHP is not expensive.

This thing runs really fast.🤩


[18-Nov-22 03:35 AM] exeler#0000
For at least some of the test flights I was looking at, the speed difference was pretty negligible. Especially since I typically only check and move ships once a day, an hour or two faster on a minimum fuel flight isn't super meaningful. 

I like the fuel saving engine though, that actually seems to cut down fuel usage a good bit while not sacrificing too much speed.

Also, I kinda just want an excuse to make RHP. I've been selling some on the CX and plan on starting a small stockpile there if/when I find some downtime with my HWP


[18-Nov-22 03:44 AM] exeler#0000
How's this layout look? I went with a smaller STL tank because I generally don't run out of that nearly as often as I do FTL. 

The quick charge reactor also had no real observable difference from the standard one.

[18-Nov-22 03:52 AM] exeler#0000
Unless I've misunderstood something, this doesn't look like a wholesale replacement.

Looks like I'd need to upgrade the crew quarters, and swap 2 medium emiters for large ones. Then it's just about swapping the cargo bay and the fuel tank that I want, and adding some plates and SSC.

I make the plates so that's not an issue, and now I wouldn't need to buy an ENG, BR1, FFC, MFE, SFE, RCT, or SSL

I found that your planets are all very close, so it doesn't matter. I prefer to fly faster, otherwise it will take a long time to fly across cx.

[18-Nov-22 05:52 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Obviously you can do your own upgrade if you want, but we have a upgrade kit for 600k that gets you a 1000m/3000t ship from your starter ship


[18-Nov-22 05:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
And then we have our standard ftl ship that is 3.5 million. Allocater also pinned the corp costs for all major ship components in this channel or ship status. The CX won’t give you accurate pricing for most ship stuff


[18-Nov-22 05:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
I estimated your upgrade plan, which is About  1.5M if SSC and RHP are not included.


[18-Nov-22 05:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
The WCB upgrade package only needs 500k.


[18-Nov-22 10:03 AM] allocater#0000
ok if you just need CQM and LCB for your upgrade that is 700k + 300k


[18-Nov-22 12:52 PM] churavis#0000
I now have RDS available for sale, with 3 in stock on ANT and more on the way.  The CX price is 300k but the corp price is 200k. I'll have RDL available soon too.

RDS lowers your damage multiplier without increasing repair cost or complexity. 

If you want one then let me know soon before I start advertising to the general public.


[18-Nov-22 04:18 PM] exeler#0000
Is it just one required per ship, or is this a component I'd need to buy like 10 of?


[18-Nov-22 04:19 PM] rune_242#0000
Just one


[18-Nov-22 04:20 PM] churavis#0000
Just one, and you shouldn't need to add anything else besides the RDS


[18-Nov-22 04:40 PM] exeler#0000
Ooh, that's a tempting idea.


[18-Nov-22 04:42 PM] churavis#0000
You'll definitely want it for your RHP boat at least, to cut down on repair cost and frequency


[18-Nov-22 06:23 PM] dehzhas#0000

Is GEN the bottleneck for the STL ships? If I wanted BRS and CQS 1) do we have any and 2) will it affect the corp production?

Depends on the upgrade

WBC upgrade is only 500k now.


[20-Nov-22 09:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
WCB is the standard upgrade pack, anything else would be weird 😛 Will have to wait for allocater, he knows the stocks.


[20-Nov-22 09:01 PM] churavis#0000
I've got RDS available


[20-Nov-22 09:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, this is enough. If you want me to say what can be improved, it is to replace the ship's armor with LHP  , which avoid saving two kind of maintenance products. At the same time ，it can run a little faster.


[20-Nov-22 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000

[26-Nov-22 12:30 PM] churavis#0000
I'm getting tired of having to allocate cargo space for FTL fuel and I'm adding an RDL anyways so figured it would be a good time to upgrade


[26-Nov-22 12:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I bought two mfl for my starter ships. That 300 limit is a pain in the ass


[26-Nov-22 12:32 PM] churavis#0000
It's only really good for starter planets and smaller cargo bays


[26-Nov-22 12:35 PM] churavis#0000
The MFL and RDL won't slow down the acceleration of the starter ship any more than the WCB already does


[26-Nov-22 06:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you can bump the volume of your starter ship to 1000 m3 you can improve the FTL performance with an LFE. Doesn't apply if you upgraded the cargo bay since you'll be wayt over that anyway


[26-Nov-22 07:31 PM] churavis#0000
What do you mean bump it up with an LFE? You don't choose how many LFE you have, it's based automatically on volume


[26-Nov-22 07:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
At 1000 vol, the starter ship swaps from 2 Small and 3 medium to 1 small + 1 large


[26-Nov-22 07:54 PM] churavis#0000
That improves the FTL performance?


[26-Nov-22 07:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, significantly


[26-Nov-22 07:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
about 40% better, at the cost of a bit of STL performance due to the added mass.


[26-Nov-22 07:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
So you bump up STL Fuel size from small to medium (since the FTL tank isn't big enough to push you above that 1000m3 number)


[26-Nov-22 07:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
the 1000m3 breakpoint is really the only significant breakpoint for performance I've found


[27-Nov-22 06:38 AM] _bojidar#0000
is that aply to already upgraded ships 3t/1m ? and its goodto increase ftl storage?


[27-Nov-22 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nope, the cargo bay bumps it way up to 1488t, which is 2 small, 1 med, 1 large. And there aren't really any breakpoints for efficiency up there. I don't believe there's any ship configuration that is 2 large 0 med, 1 small emitter


[28-Nov-22 06:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
does it make sense to upgrade the starter ships to a fuel saving engine? are there some already-established obvious upgrades that I should be installing on my starter ships? I like the fuel saving bonuses of my new 2K ship


[28-Nov-22 07:59 AM] churavis#0000
Not really, the ones that make sense are WCB, MFL, and RDL


[28-Nov-22 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Can I buy a 3000m/1000t ship?  Got the cash on hand, but no need to jump whatever line we have.  I know about the extra cost


[28-Nov-22 03:06 PM] allocater#0000
I put you in the queue, ETA Dec. 5th


[03-Dec-22 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000

[04-Dec-22 06:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
On an unrelated note, I can’t tell if people are “upset” about the 4 million price tag on the ship or the auction. I suspect the latter, but why? Upset is too strong a word in this case, but I’m curious as to why the generally negative perception of the offer.


[04-Dec-22 06:59 PM] dehzhas#0000
If I had 4 million, I would take it right now. I just paid off my 3.5 million loan for one, so I don’t, but ships are definitely worth an extra 200-300k to me if I get it right now vs 4+ weeks.


[05-Dec-22 04:39 AM] rune_242#0000
I see that the queue is getting quite long.
what is the bottleneck at the moment?

[05-Dec-22 12:53 PM] allocater#0000
ok it's good to have each component offered on the cx for inflated prices anyway


[05-Dec-22 12:55 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, that's what made me laugh about people balking at the 4mil minimum when we can easily sell it all on the CX for at least as much if not as quick or easy.


[05-Dec-22 01:03 PM] dehzhas#0000
The more I think about it, the more I think the 4mil wasn't the issue. It was the auction.


[05-Dec-22 01:06 PM] dehzhas#0000
Also, not many players have 4 mil sitting around. I can save that much in short order, but I don't tend to leave capital sitting around, I would rather invest it. I wonder if leaving it available for a longer period with a "buy now" price might do better.


[05-Dec-22 01:06 PM] dehzhas#0000
Most of the people that have 4 mil on a regular basis are selling ships already 🤣


[05-Dec-22 01:07 PM] churavis#0000
I thought about offering financing


[05-Dec-22 01:08 PM] dehzhas#0000
I bet with financing you could sell it for 4+ with regular payments. I would do payments rather than a big lump sum at the end to mitigate risk of failure to pay.


[05-Dec-22 01:10 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, payments also ensure a harsher reputation drop if they do default as multiple breached contracts will actually lower it a letter or two


[05-Dec-22 01:11 PM] allocater#0000
so putting the actual value of each component per contract?


[05-Dec-22 01:14 PM] dehzhas#0000
I was thinking 8 contracts of 550k each due 1 week apart (basically 550k/wk).


[05-Dec-22 01:16 PM] dehzhas#0000
That total is 4.4 mil, which seems reasonable with financing. I can buy a ship for 4 mil from several people in the game, but I have to wait in line and pay the full amount at delivery (as far as I know). Financing that for 400k to get the ship now and pay later seems reasonable to me.


[05-Dec-22 01:17 PM] dehzhas#0000
550k a week is a lot easier to handle, and you can basically do it on 4+ bases without huge risk.


[05-Dec-22 01:18 PM] allocater#0000
2 month does sound quite long, people might quit, Maybe I might quit in 2 months 😄


[05-Dec-22 01:19 PM] dehzhas#0000
No, you are not allowed to quit in 2 months 🙀 😉

{Reactions}
😅 

[05-Dec-22 01:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
If they can afford 550k/week and are getting to the point where they are buying a ship, maybe they aren't likely to just quit?


[05-Dec-22 01:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
4 weeks might be better


[05-Dec-22 01:21 PM] dehzhas#0000
The only thing about financing is you have to be able to sustain the payment based on weekly income. You probably need 8+ bases to handle 1.1 mil a week


[05-Dec-22 01:22 PM] allocater#0000
we can also play with downpayment amount


[05-Dec-22 01:22 PM] dehzhas#0000
That might work better... mitigate the risk, prove they can raise capital, etc.


[05-Dec-22 01:22 PM] allocater#0000
"get a ship for 1 mil!  .... plus 3mil in rate payments"


[05-Dec-22 01:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
What is our raw cost on a ship? We would want to minimize the risk that we don't get at least that much.


[05-Dec-22 01:25 PM] allocater#0000
idk, the accountant quit, and we just kept it 3.5 mil 😄


[05-Dec-22 01:42 PM] dehzhas#0000

Allocater did this for me not long ago, they will contract you the parts and the payment contract all at the same time. I think it was on Heph.


[05-Dec-22 08:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
I bought three LBCs and two STLs from him, but I did collect the WBC upgrade package myself.


[05-Dec-22 08:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
I checked allocator's records. He didn't even record the sales of WBC upgrade packages. He only recorded the sales of LCB, VCB and STL.


[05-Dec-22 08:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
He does offer them, I think they are fairly ad hoc since they are just a few items.


[05-Dec-22 08:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, everyone can collect the materials of WBC upgrade package from cx, which is the easiest to obtain.


[05-Dec-22 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll sell an LFE on ANT for 120k.


[05-Dec-22 10:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Allocater has the title shipwright for a reason, so I’d follow whatever guidance he has. He’s been offering the 500k upgrade package for a couple months now. Before that, folks went ad hoc, which is what I did. But I wouldn’t tell anyone in the corp these days to take more time or spend more money


[05-Dec-22 10:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
Did we have an spreadsheet that mapped out the production tree for ships? I thought I saw that somewhere but now I can't find it.

450k for the package, or single components:

📦WCB 300k
📦LFE 100k
📦BHPx16 50k
📦SSCx25 7k


[06-Dec-22 03:04 AM] exeler#0000
I sent contracts for 2 piece meal upgrades worth. Bringing my own BHP makes the kit more expensive than the pieces by themselves

[06-Dec-22 03:24 AM] rune_242#0000
I did that for both my ships

OK, I'll check out what I need then.


[06-Dec-22 03:25 AM] balbar#0000
my flights are mostly ANT -> x -> ANT (maybe with another planet inbetween), 300FF is plenty for that. As with most cases, it depends on your situation


[06-Dec-22 03:25 AM] rune_242#0000
You can upgrade them to 2k FF with just a little SSC, BHP and one LFE


[06-Dec-22 03:25 AM] rune_242#0000
And a LFL of course😅


[06-Dec-22 03:26 AM] domicius#0000
I'll spend some time in the dockyards to set it up. I don't enjoy the dockyards.

Without these boats, my business would collapse.🤣


[06-Dec-22 03:40 AM] balbar#0000
your business is streched across half the universe. Of course you need more ships😁


[06-Dec-22 03:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, I can buy raw materials across cx to reduce the cost. In addition, if my boat has spare space, HRT food and Benten's manufactured products are suitable for sale in ANT.


[06-Dec-22 03:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
My new ship is going to be deployed to Moria area, so that I have ships and sales networks in four major CX.


[06-Dec-22 03:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
Many products of Moria are still very competitive in price.  I can also build a new EDC farm there to raise their inflation.🤣


[07-Dec-22 02:01 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I still only have two ships, one with WCB. If I want a gas hauler, would upgrading the second starter ship be more cost effective than buying a third?


[07-Dec-22 02:02 PM] churavis#0000
It's almost a new ship, only WCBs are worth it


[07-Dec-22 02:58 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ok cool, I will factor it into future plans


[08-Dec-22 12:56 AM] exeler#0000
What's the in-corp price for an MCB? I'm guessing it would be around half of the WCB?


[08-Dec-22 12:58 AM] gladeowl#0000
^ How much would an upgrade cost for a Starter >> MCB?


[08-Dec-22 02:03 AM] allocater#0000
MCB itself would be ~~100k~~150k and the upgrade kit ~~250k~~300k.


[08-Dec-22 02:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm not selling MCB for 100k.


[08-Dec-22 02:04 AM] allocater#0000
150k?

{Reactions}
👌 

[08-Dec-22 02:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
I bought all my AST  at 1100, and 16 MFK.


[08-Dec-22 02:06 AM] allocater#0000
I always do alloy=1k 😅


[08-Dec-22 02:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now the price of raw materials has gone up.  Alloy makers also have to buy Al or TI from CX.


[08-Dec-22 10:39 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Don't be buying no MCB.  If you want, I'll give you the 200k so you can just get a WCB


[08-Dec-22 09:10 PM] gladeowl#0000
Gotcha, will factor that into my plans. Cheers.


[12-Dec-22 01:09 PM] allocater#0000
I am out of LHP atm


[12-Dec-22 03:40 PM] exeler#0000
I've got a big order of plates coming to ANT soon. 

I've been making an even mix of BHP, LHP, and RHP. If we need more LHP I can shift the ratio


[12-Dec-22 03:42 PM] churavis#0000
RHP?


[12-Dec-22 03:53 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, the hull plates with some TI in them instead of STL.


[12-Dec-22 03:54 PM] churavis#0000
I know what they are, I'm wondering what build you're using them for


[12-Dec-22 03:57 PM] exeler#0000
They sell for more, and are just as easy to make (if not easier) than BHP. 

For a while some rando kept throwing up CX orders for them and I filled them.

They're easy to make so I figured why not. When I go to build a brand new ship I'm gonna use those for the added protection. 

The next tier of plates is a bit more involved to make, but I think TI is generally easier to source than STL. Although making plates doesn't have much of a demand for either, it's mostly the large volume of AL that I need to worry about.


[12-Dec-22 04:14 PM] jackinabox86#0000
well, it's probably good to get allocater a stockpile of LHP so it doesn't hold up the ship construction rate.  The RHP take a lot more HWP time


[12-Dec-22 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've got 200 spare AL @ 350 on Deimos if someone wants it for this.


[12-Dec-22 05:22 PM] exeler#0000
He did have a stockpile. I swear I sold hundreds of it on Deimos and a few more hundreds on Hephaestus, and bombed the CX down to sell into his orders 😅

Y'all just chewing it up fast. I might build another HWP just to keep up.

you mean the upgrade for 450k?


[19-Dec-22 08:13 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Yes that's what I meant.


[19-Dec-22 08:15 AM] allocater#0000
you get 30 days to pay it off, so you can pretend to put aside 15k per day 😄

[21-Dec-22 02:28 AM] allocater#0000
there is no list for upgrades, they are instant available 🙂

It will go faster if you don't have all that heavy shielding on it


[21-Dec-22 04:08 PM] emperyan11#0000
We're talking 0.3 m/s acceleration difference, nothing on FTL


[21-Dec-22 04:10 PM] emperyan11#0000
She can make Deimos >> ANT in 46 minutes and ANT >> HRT in 10h 24 min at full burn.


[21-Dec-22 04:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
the hyperthrust engine would be nearly 2 million alone


[21-Dec-22 04:12 PM] jackinabox86#0000
a bit off with corp pricing for some components in that


[21-Dec-22 04:13 PM] churavis#0000
Weight also increases fuel burn


[21-Dec-22 04:13 PM] churavis#0000
Plus repairs would be such a pain


[21-Dec-22 04:13 PM] emperyan11#0000
True

also true


[21-Dec-22 04:14 PM] emperyan11#0000
Hence the crazy shielding. Also, this would be for Corp emergencies so most of the time it would be in orbit around Antares Station getting washed.


[21-Dec-22 04:14 PM] emperyan11#0000

the ftl engine would be another 850k+


[21-Dec-22 04:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
so you're looking at 3mil for both engines, probably


[21-Dec-22 04:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might there be demand elsewhere in the galaxy? At such high margins, even supplying over long distance could hypothetically be profitable. Especially if you take orders. Surprised there's no shipmaker's union up yet. (edit: pardon me if that's a dumb question, I don't understand the shipyard/upgrade systems yet as a new player.)


[21-Dec-22 04:50 PM] emperyan11#0000
Hey, it's "just money"... if I need a few more weeks, I need a few more weeks.


[21-Dec-22 06:03 PM] exeler#0000
Probably the least problematic on the list, but if you swap the AHP for RHP I can make a bunch for you.


[21-Dec-22 06:04 PM] churavis#0000
It wouldn't go as fast with RHP


[21-Dec-22 06:09 PM] exeler#0000
But it would be a decent bit easier to repair wouldn't it?


[21-Dec-22 06:10 PM] churavis#0000
But ship go brrrrrrr


[21-Dec-22 06:12 PM] churavis#0000
All we need for AHP instead of RHP is FET, we have people that make that, right?


[21-Dec-22 06:17 PM] exeler#0000
We should since it's used in a bunch of other things that we make right?

The HWP is interesting though, didn't realize that it increases dramatically for the higher tier plates. Almost 24 hours for 4 plates is a bit yikes.


[21-Dec-22 06:18 PM] churavis#0000
The default time is 21:36, so it'll be much less with efficiency factors


[21-Dec-22 06:49 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I can do some fet if we actually do something like this


[21-Dec-22 06:49 PM] jackinabox86#0000
My ASM is pretty lazy since I have way too much FAL


[21-Dec-22 06:50 PM] churavis#0000
Do it, I want AHP


[21-Dec-22 06:54 PM] churavis#0000
I'll need 56 AHP for the initial build which translates to 140 FET


[21-Dec-22 06:55 PM] churavis#0000
Let me know if you need help with the FE or TI


[21-Dec-22 06:56 PM] jackinabox86#0000

as long as I don't have to organize it and somebody sends me contracts I can fulfill. I suggest we go top-down where Emperyan sends all component requests to the relevant building owners, who then cascade their requests further down for sub-components to their building-owners and we will see where it clogs.

The production of CQM will be affected by DEC again. Can anyone provide DEC?

yes


[26-Dec-22 10:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now there are 13 DEC gaps, and my own products haven't arrived yet.


[26-Dec-22 10:41 PM] churavis#0000
I have a bit of DEC on Nike, the construction planet, because that's where my UPF is, because it's a construction building


[26-Dec-22 10:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
There is no room for UPF in my nike base， so all my three UPFs are in Heph.


[26-Dec-22 10:44 PM] churavis#0000
If they were on Nike, you'd only need two


[26-Dec-22 10:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
how many DEC can you share now？


[26-Dec-22 10:45 PM] churavis#0000
10 at the moment, I usually only make it when a POL base runs out of an input for PG and EPO


[26-Dec-22 10:45 PM] churavis#0000
I won't be able to transport it as I just sent my last Nike-Ant run and won't be back for a while


[26-Dec-22 10:46 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can start making you some but I have to move inputs, my EPO planets have no PG and my PG planet has no EPO


[26-Dec-22 10:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
It's okay. My ANT-nike boat will arrive at NIke soon. I sent the contract and I picked up the goods from NIke.


[26-Dec-22 10:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter. It's a long-term job. CQM has been consuming a lot of DEC from me. My products are still in benten, and it will take a long time to ship them.


[26-Dec-22 10:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
If possible, I hope to pick up the goods at ANT, of course heph is better.@mrtcsmith


[26-Dec-22 11:14 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
No problem, all outputs a planet doesn't need usually get sent back to ANT anyway and I can send them on any ship heading to Heph

The last ship of the year just sold. This was the most successful year yet, with 46 produced ships. Compared to the 0 ships last year, this is an improvement of ∞%.

Extrapolating from that we will produce ∞ ships next year! 🥳

Do we ever need STS? DLR had me build a AAF to make 2 STS for something a long time ago, then he kept stalling on picking them up. They have been collecting dust in my Phobos storage since lol


[30-Dec-22 11:01 AM] churavis#0000
I already built an AAF for NV2, did you have any of those in storage?


[30-Dec-22 11:01 AM] churavis#0000
I'm pretty sure I asked if anyone had an AAF  while ago


[30-Dec-22 11:06 AM] yjhasaday#0000
No NV2. I was pretty new at the time so DLR just spotted me the Afabs for long enough to build 2 STS then I tore it down to recycle the Afabs lol


[30-Dec-22 11:08 AM] churavis#0000
Given that STS don't make repairs more expensive, I plan on making lots of them for all my ships because why not now that I have an AAF.


[30-Dec-22 11:09 AM] churavis#0000
We'll need NV2 for any fast ships we make as well


[30-Dec-22 09:42 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Is there a list of common ships/blueprints and costs? Are the pins by DLR the usual ships? A puddlejumper is around 600k, a 2k/2k is 3.5mil and a 3k/1k upgrade is 450k?

Wonder if you reach out to the purchaser, if y'all might be able to negotiate a few parts orders? That way you get ahead of the competition, guarantee profit, and build to order.

Is the default puddlejumper 3k/1k? The pinned screenshot is 500/500


[09-Jan-23 10:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you upgrade the initial ship, it's usually 3k/1k. If you buy a new boat, it's usually 2k/2k.


[09-Jan-23 10:02 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I was thinking more of the STL only ship, 2k/2k ship would mean it needs a CQM rather than CQT or something


[09-Jan-23 10:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
Usually, STL ships only need 500 .


[09-Jan-23 10:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
My three STL boats are all 500.

[09-Jan-23 10:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
STL ships are responsible for transporting consumables, while FTL ships are used for transporting bulk goods. This is more appropriate.


[09-Jan-23 10:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
Besides, as you said, if CQM is needed, the cost will increase.

[09-Jan-23 10:29 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah. The price of a bigger stl ship is so much higher that you might as well just make it an ftl ship for more flexibility. Like Yuen said, speed can be an issue as well

I'm considering getting one of these, mainly, I often have need for a very fast small ship to git one or two components that I need from one random place to another quickly.

I already have the BR1, SSL and SSC. What would something like that cost? Not ready to pull the trigger yet, but looking at the cost/benefit.

roughly 2.2mil


[10-Jan-23 02:47 PM] churavis#0000
Did you have a specific purpose in mind for a ship with such a small cargo bay?


[10-Jan-23 03:00 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, I often have one consumable or another that I forget or is delayed and I need a fast ship to move it quickly... either that or an input runs dry and I need to restart it fast. My big bulk cruisers are highly utilized so taking one of them out of rotation to drop off a small package is annoying and logistically painful


[10-Jan-23 03:02 PM] churavis#0000
That is exactly what I'm building The King's Horse for, except it will have much more powerful engines and thus be able to respond to emergencies faster


[10-Jan-23 03:02 PM] dehzhas#0000
I owe @jackinabox86 3 HSS on Deimos from the last shipment, but I forgot to put it on the cruiser... it's been sitting unfulfilled for a couple days because I have nothing unoccupied quite yet


[10-Jan-23 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
You might want to do a check to see if throwing in better seats will improve the acceleration, even with those engines, since the mass is so low.


[10-Jan-23 03:03 PM] dehzhas#0000
The benefit of the tiny ship is it is fast... that ship can make it from ANT to Griffonstone in about 5 hours


[10-Jan-23 03:04 PM] dehzhas#0000
I tried the better seats and couldn't get it to go any faster

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Jan-23 03:04 PM] dehzhas#0000
I could put a higher power FTL on it, but it wasn't worth the extra FTL burn since this is so small and light


[10-Jan-23 03:04 PM] churavis#0000
The better seats are only helpful if you also have a more powerful engine and higher tier plates


[10-Jan-23 03:06 PM] dehzhas#0000
That ship does ANT -> Griff in 4h 1m for 287 STL and 118 FTL, which is pretty darn responsive


[10-Jan-23 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
that's pretty good....


[10-Jan-23 03:07 PM] churavis#0000
Did you give it higher tier plates and seats?


[10-Jan-23 03:07 PM] dehzhas#0000
The medium FTL lets it do ANT -> MOR in one go at 100% FTL burn (~15-16h one way)


[10-Jan-23 03:10 PM] dehzhas#0000
I probably haven't tried every combination, but they all max out at about the same place from what I see. The FTL is the main limiting factor in this case, but I don't want to pay the fuel costs of a higher tier FTL engine.


[10-Jan-23 03:14 PM] churavis#0000
The fastest speeds of higher tier engine aren't achievable unless you have higher tier plates and higher tier seats.

FTL doesn't matter as much for trips with only a few jumps, which is where the majority of bases are, so your STL engine matters more so.


[10-Jan-23 03:14 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm also trying to minimize ship building costs


[10-Jan-23 03:16 PM] churavis#0000
I'll be parking The King's Horse on Ant most of the time and will be glad to rent it out for other people's emergencies too so you could maybe get by relying on that along with better organization but it's up to you.

On that ship design I actually am seeing a difference in flight speed, even with low FTL usage, by using basic g-seats

[10-Jan-23 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even the crummy STL engines perform high accelleration when the mass is so low


[10-Jan-23 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
someone can double check that I guess but seems like it


[10-Jan-23 03:21 PM] churavis#0000
Does that remain true if you fill up the cargo bay at all?


[10-Jan-23 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
wow apparently not


[10-Jan-23 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
pretty annoying


[10-Jan-23 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I never check that, heh


[10-Jan-23 03:27 PM] churavis#0000
It makes sense


[10-Jan-23 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Gotta try everything 3 times cause the flight values are so wonky sometimes....


[10-Jan-23 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
The boost disappears between 40-60t of cargo


[10-Jan-23 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
unless you're buring more fuel


[10-Jan-23 03:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
I also tend to max FTL on my runs with the quick charge FTL, it doesn't cost that much extra FTL relative to the speed boost you get.


[10-Jan-23 03:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
Here is what I get high G:

[10-Jan-23 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah it's often a difference between buring 17 FF and 23 FF


[10-Jan-23 03:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
No extra G:

[10-Jan-23 03:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
okay so pretty marginal there. I was testing ANT->Griff


[10-Jan-23 03:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
A difference of 4 minutes slower and 16 extra STL


[10-Jan-23 03:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
me too 🙂


[10-Jan-23 03:34 PM] dehzhas#0000
Testing Deimos -> Nike I can get a bigger difference 1h 35m (508 STL) vs 1h 51m (304 STL). The extra STL burn just isn't worth it to me.


[10-Jan-23 03:35 PM] dehzhas#0000
Under any weight condition, max FTL, the STL/G seats make marginal differences for usually significantly more fuel cost


[10-Jan-23 03:35 PM] dehzhas#0000
for this build anyway


[10-Jan-23 03:35 PM] dehzhas#0000
Bigger ships are probably different


[10-Jan-23 03:36 PM] churavis#0000
If my PP2s were out of AL then 20 minutes faster would definitely be worth 1,632 AIC of extra fuel


[10-Jan-23 03:37 PM] dehzhas#0000
The basic High-G seats add 20t to the empty mass, which might be why the ROI is so low.


[10-Jan-23 03:38 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, seats are only helpful with higher tier engines and higher tier plates


[10-Jan-23 03:44 PM] dehzhas#0000
Strangely, with this design (20t max STL/FTL burn, LHP):

* Hyperthrust STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 45m (1500 STL)
* Hyperthrust STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 48m (1500 STL)
* Advanced STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 42m (1119 STL)
* Advanced STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 41m (1385 STL)
* Fuel-saving STL + no G seats: 1h 42m (463 STL)


[10-Jan-23 03:45 PM] churavis#0000
What tier of plates are you using?


[10-Jan-23 03:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
Those are all with LHP, I'm re-running with others


[10-Jan-23 03:47 PM] churavis#0000
LHP will cap your max acceleration regardless of any other factors


[10-Jan-23 03:50 PM] dehzhas#0000
Strangely, with this design (20t max STL/FTL burn, Reinforced Hull Plate):

* Hyperthrust STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 35m (1499 STL)
* Hyperthrust STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 43m (1500 STL)
* Advanced STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 31m (1208 STL)
* Advanced STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 38m (1357 STL)
* Fuel-saving STL + no G seats: 1h 39m (426 STL)


[10-Jan-23 03:51 PM] churavis#0000
How much cargo weight are you moving?


[10-Jan-23 03:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
The plates can add a lot of mass


[10-Jan-23 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess the max g factor between the plates and the seats stack


[10-Jan-23 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is a little goofy


[10-Jan-23 03:54 PM] dehzhas#0000
With this design (20t max STL/FTL burn, Basic Hull Plate):

* Hyperthrust STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 43m (1499 STL)
* Hyperthrust STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 58m (1499 STL)
* Advanced STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 37m (1355 STL)
* Advanced STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 51m (1463 STL)
* Fuel-saving STL + no G seats: 1h 51m (480 STL)


[10-Jan-23 03:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
BHP are terrible apparently


[10-Jan-23 03:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
Too much weight for the speed benefit probably


[10-Jan-23 03:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
LHP seems much better in many ways


[10-Jan-23 03:58 PM] dehzhas#0000
Moving 20t from Diemos to Nike, the top 3 absolute fastest combos (all Reinforced hull plates):

* Advanced STL + Advanced High-G Seats: 1h 31m (1208 STL)
* Advanced STL + Basic High-G Seats: 1h 38m (1357 STL)          + 1.2k fuel, +1 min
* Fuel-saving STL + no G seats: 1h 39m (426 STL)                          - 6.3k fuel, +8 min

👍 

[10-Jan-23 03:59 PM] dehzhas#0000
YMMV by a couple minutes depending on the whim of the ship gods

Also, these were done at 20t, but moving the slider between 0t and 100t made no difference in time (it made a difference in fuel cost)


[12-Jan-23 03:38 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have an inquiry from SeaPear about purchasing a ship. He is wondering the cost for us to build it. It's basically a standard 2k/2k with a standard FTL instead of a quick charge:

[12-Jan-23 03:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
I know we have a bit of a backlog at the moment, but I figure we can at least give him a price.


[12-Jan-23 04:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
The two reactors are probably pretty close in price, so I suspect it'll be the out-of-corp price of 4.5 mil. allocator can confirm that though


[12-Jan-23 07:38 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I would like to buy a WCB upgrade and queue for an STL ship please @allocater


[12-Jan-23 07:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
If Allocator provides you with a WCB upgrade package, you don't have to pay, I'll pay.


[12-Jan-23 07:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Thanks but a newbie might benefit more? Yesterday I hit 4mil cash and today I hit 5, I also just realised I'm sitting on 3mil of rfabs 💸


[12-Jan-23 07:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
COOl, you are out of the novice period, but I didn't expect that you haven't upgraded your initial ship yet.🤣


[12-Jan-23 07:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah I upgraded one a while back but haven't had a need for the other one until recently


[12-Jan-23 07:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that you have managed transportation very well.


[13-Jan-23 02:17 AM] allocater#0000
create the ads, both are ready


[13-Jan-23 02:17 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
How's does getting an upgrade work anyway?


[13-Jan-23 02:18 AM] allocater#0000
yes, you can offer it for 4mil, the single components currently sell for 4.5m on the market


[13-Jan-23 02:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
Can we buy a boat for resale at a company price?😅


[13-Jan-23 02:58 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
What is the best way to do the ads, one for each part and another for the total price? How much is the STL, 600k?


[13-Jan-23 02:59 AM] allocater#0000
you enter the starter ship and the new ship, it calculates the difference in materials, you put those materials in, the ship is transformed to the new ship after 24h


[13-Jan-23 09:54 AM] allocater#0000
what do you think about a new rule, that only the first 5 FTL ships per member are discounted 3.5m and after that it is marketprice (currently 4m) to encourage more distribution?


[13-Jan-23 09:54 AM] domicius#0000
There's people that have bought 5 ships? Wow

{Reactions}
😅 

[13-Jan-23 09:56 AM] domicius#0000
I'm fine with that. I mean, if you can afford 5 ships 0.5m won't make much diff. Although if you want to increase distribution (capture the market) then a quota system is better.


[13-Jan-23 09:56 AM] domicius#0000
Eg 5 discount ships per month, junior members under 5 ships get first dibs. Something like that, whatever parameters make sense.


[13-Jan-23 10:05 AM] dehzhas#0000
What would the timeline be... I mean, we have a long internal queue. I assume we could slot him in before the 2nd loan peeps at least?


[13-Jan-23 10:07 AM] allocater#0000
good question, we need a plan how to service internal ships, deal ships and CX. atm it's a bit chaotic 😄


[13-Jan-23 10:08 AM] dehzhas#0000
I think 5 is a generous number to get at discount. I'm close to that and almost don't mind paying market rate at this point for #4.


[13-Jan-23 10:08 AM] dehzhas#0000
The extra 500k is not a big deal if you are making enough to afford that many ships

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Jan-23 12:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
No loan or discount after 3 ships seems fair


[13-Jan-23 12:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If someone is contributing, I’ll loan them the money. But not everyone buying cheap ships is actually an active member


[13-Jan-23 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If Allocater wants more profit, which he handsomely deserves, then we can sell some external in my mind. But otherwise, why not do just internal if we can actually use them?


[13-Jan-23 01:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
I’m highly in favor of market price after 3.


[13-Jan-23 01:31 PM] dehzhas#0000
I’d be ok with partial loan or something depending on circumstances, like @jackinabox86 suggests.


[13-Jan-23 02:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the long run, we can even cancel the internal price concessions of ships and provide direct sponsorship funds for active players to build bases instead. Now I agree with Jack that more than three ships should be paid according to the market price.


[13-Jan-23 02:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
However, I think it is very necessary that the members of Corp should have the preemptive right in the first few ships.


[13-Jan-23 02:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
In particular, the lack of ships should not be allowed to affect their expansion.

Can you get me some outside prices?


[14-Jan-23 11:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
But the gap is not big. I will charge an extra 50k for WCB. If you have a good relationship with him, you can do without it


[14-Jan-23 11:24 PM] churavis#0000
Do you have LFL and MSL in stock?


[14-Jan-23 11:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
There is no LFL, because it is not easy to sell. It can be bought from CX at the same price. If he wants to buy it from me, it will take me two days to produce it.


[14-Jan-23 11:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have MSL and WCB in stock.


[14-Jan-23 11:31 PM] churavis#0000

[15-Jan-23 05:11 PM] dehzhas#0000
FYI, I had access to an older version of the sheet at one point not to long ago and these prices are higher by a good bit than they were.


[15-Jan-23 05:11 PM] dehzhas#0000
Looks like ship prices are generally going up across the board


[15-Jan-23 05:22 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
He showed that sheet some time ago when talking about ship bottlenecks too


[15-Jan-23 06:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
Really? Are their prices still so cheap?


[15-Jan-23 06:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
It is clear that according to his price, the profits of many links will be weakened. Although we will not lose money, we will not make much money. Unless their production capacity is high enough to monopolize the market, I don't know what the point is. Nowadays, it is generally the buyers who are waiting for the ship.


[15-Jan-23 06:31 PM] yuen8241#0000
I compared the prices. They are mainly CQM and BR1, which are cheaper than ours.


[15-Jan-23 06:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
The WCB and MFL I am responsible for are ether cheaper or more expensive, which basically offset each other.


[15-Jan-23 06:33 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Their FSE is super cheap


[15-Jan-23 06:37 PM] yuen8241#0000

In the composition of 2k ships, their CQM, BR1 and LFE are cheaper.


[15-Jan-23 06:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
Wait, does this mean two LFE? Then our LFE are cheaper in this case.

[15-Jan-23 06:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main difference in price is this.


[15-Jan-23 06:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
A total difference of 400k was generated.


[15-Jan-23 06:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
If the external price is considered, the difference is 800K .


[15-Jan-23 06:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
I just found out that the price of FSE has increased, so the main difference between us and them is the price of these four products, if their LCB also uses FSE.

Most components sell on the CX at higher prices than either of our prices.


[15-Jan-23 06:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
LFEs regularly sell at 200k and apparently occasionally at 500k lol


[15-Jan-23 07:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
Their CQM and BR1 add up to 400k cheaper than ours, while QCR and FSE add up to 100k cheaper than ours. The main price gap is because of these.


[15-Jan-23 07:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am still based on the company's price. If it is an external price, the gap will be even greater.


[16-Jan-23 06:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
Can any of us produce AGS?


[16-Jan-23 08:58 AM] churavis#0000
I got mine from Melon as no one in corp has an SPP since Pokter and he had a tough time keeping it busy even at 19% productivity. I do have 8 TK if he needs it.


[17-Jan-23 01:42 PM] emperyan11#0000
I'm looking for some advanced plating and shields... specifically 50 AHP, 56 APT, 56 ARP and 56 AWH


[17-Jan-23 01:44 PM] emperyan11#0000
Got a whole list of other stuff two but this week's laundry list is  the X-boat hull


[17-Jan-23 03:05 PM] exeler#0000
I can take a look at what I need for the plates and other things made in a HWP. 

If it needs ASM time because I can't source the HWP inputs directly it's gonna take some time since my ASM is busy slowly cooking another complex order.

Otherwise if I can get the HWP inputs directly from someone, then I can make the plates relatively quickly since I have 3 of them available on standby cranking out LHP for dumping on the CX (ie, allocater's MM buy order)


[17-Jan-23 03:19 PM] churavis#0000
I will also be needing AHP for King's Horse


[17-Jan-23 04:34 PM] emperyan11#0000
Are we racing to see who can build an emergency responder first?  🤔🤣


[17-Jan-23 04:36 PM] churavis#0000
We could but it wouldn't be fair as I'm the one building your BR2 and that might just get suddenly delayed due to unspecified "technical issues"


[17-Jan-23 04:49 PM] emperyan11#0000
LMAO


[17-Jan-23 04:59 PM] emperyan11#0000
Is $125k ICA "reasonable" for a MSL?


[17-Jan-23 05:09 PM] exeler#0000
Looks like AHP is pretty simple to make. I just need FET. If anyone has a stockpile of it, I'd be willing to trade the FE and TI inputs for the FET to get started on the AHP


[17-Jan-23 05:18 PM] exeler#0000
Do you need the same amount? 50 AHP? For a total of 100 for both of the speedster ships?


[17-Jan-23 05:34 PM] exeler#0000
If get the FET off the CX I can do 8k per AHP and have them ready pretty quickly (A week for all 100). If I can scoop the FET for cheaper, or swap FE/TI + a tip for FET I can make them for cheaper.

Or if you guys don't mind waiting multiple weeks I can make the FET myself on a single ASM, and you can get the AHP for 6k/u


[17-Jan-23 05:36 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can make some FET in my ASM


[17-Jan-23 05:39 PM] exeler#0000
I can consume up to 43 FET per day 😅


[17-Jan-23 05:42 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I've put some next in my queue, I have plenty of inputs and I have TI that I wasn't using for anything else right now.


[17-Jan-23 05:48 PM] exeler#0000
If you need more TI, I have a bunch I'm sitting on that has almost no purpose.

I'll buy up to 250 FET for this specific job. What's a reasonable price for it?


[17-Jan-23 05:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
No idea, I will let you know later after work 🤣

[18-Jan-23 08:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
According to the current CQM price setting, it will lead to my loss, Because the default price of DEC is too low, far cheaper than the market price..


[18-Jan-23 08:40 AM] yuen8241#0000

Quite a nifty order form


[18-Jan-23 09:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
I will lose 50k per CQM because of the price of DEC.


[18-Jan-23 09:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
If Corp can provide me with raw materials at the prices of EPO@100 and PG@15, my loss will be reduced to 300k per CQM.


[18-Jan-23 09:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
But their CQM is actually 300k to 500K cheaper than ours.😅


[18-Jan-23 09:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm losing money as an assembler


[18-Jan-23 10:16 AM] allocater#0000

[18-Jan-23 10:17 AM] allocater#0000
are you still getting PG for 20 and EPO for 100?


[18-Jan-23 10:25 AM] domicius#0000
What should I order?


[18-Jan-23 10:25 AM] domicius#0000

and DEC for 10k from balbar?


[18-Jan-23 11:11 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
@yuen8241 I have 10 DEC on ANT you can have for 10k each just send a contract


[18-Jan-23 11:18 AM] balbar#0000
@yuen8241 I have 32 DEC on Heph


[18-Jan-23 03:26 PM] emperyan11#0000
@exeler  I can provide the AL and TI if that helps... I'd spin up an ASM but I feel like that would just add steps. Thoughts?


[18-Jan-23 06:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
According to the price of PSL@2k, PSM@1k, TI@800 and DEC@10k, I can maintain the profit of 500-area base producing CQM at about 50k per day.


[18-Jan-23 06:20 PM] exeler#0000
I'm good on the metal inputs. I've got a ton of SME that are more than capable of feeding my HWP and ASM. Just was trying to see if anyone had FET around because if I have the FET my HWP can churn out the plates super quick.

Turning the metal into FET is the bottleneck and doing that on one ASM takes the time needed from days to weeks.


[18-Jan-23 06:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main problem is that DEC@10k is too low according to the current market price, which will cause the profit of a 500-area POL base to fall to 20k per day, which is equivalent to a daily loss of more than 100k.


[18-Jan-23 06:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
The price of DEC should be set at least 15k to ensure the original price system.


[18-Jan-23 06:22 PM] exeler#0000
I noticed that recently. At 10k I still do make a profit making DEC, but it doesn't add enough value to make it worth making the DEC instead of more PG or EPO


[18-Jan-23 06:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
I recalculated, and I feel more pessimistic.


[18-Jan-23 06:27 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Is the 10k our price or market price? Raise away if it’s our price


[18-Jan-23 06:28 PM] exeler#0000
Based on the fact that I make most of the inputs along the whole chain myself, my break even for DEC is around 6k. But if I consider the input costs of the PG and EPO to be the corp rate I would sell them for, the break even is around 9.5k, so there's only 500/u of value added by making a DEC.


[18-Jan-23 06:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
PG and EPO are products that are in great demand and easy to sell. DEC is the opposite, but it is cheaper.


[18-Jan-23 06:31 PM] exeler#0000
Would 14000 per DEC seem fair?


[18-Jan-23 06:31 PM] yuen8241#0000
I tend to profit from the shipbuilding industry by integrating resources and selling a large number of products that are usually difficult to sell, rather than by compressing the profits of products that are already easy to sell.

[18-Jan-23 06:36 PM] exeler#0000
In both ANT and on our sheet it looks like I'm the only one with a price 😅


[18-Jan-23 06:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
This profit is still based on DEC@12k. If it is 10k, the profit will be reduced by 12.5*2k, leaving only 27k.


[18-Jan-23 06:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
It is equivalent to as long as I produce DEC, in contrast, I will earn 130k less on POL every day.

[18-Jan-23 06:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
Unless the price of DEC is raised to 20k, but it will cause me to lose 30k on raw materials for every CQM I produce.


[18-Jan-23 06:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
However, the current EPO price is too high, so according to the profit of the conventional POL base of about 90k, DEC pricing at 15k can ensure that the money earned by POL producers will not be reduced.


[18-Jan-23 07:01 PM] emperyan11#0000
Well, then maybe I will spin up an ASM


[18-Jan-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000

[19-Jan-23 07:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000

I will build an AML in the next few days to help with my needs. I'm going to offer anyone mining LST on Nike to swap to BOR at 600/u which is roughly the same profit as LST at corp price.


[20-Jan-23 06:35 PM] churavis#0000
Do you want some TAI in case you run out of everything else?


[20-Jan-23 08:39 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The issue is BOS supply. I can sell the lot I got off Balbar to @jackinabox86 . I also have 2, nearly 3 FSE I can sell at corp prices.

I'm going to raise the price of FSE to 800k on the CX, still seems to be decent demand at 750k

If it's selling too quickly then the price isn't high enough


[30-Jan-23 03:25 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah, that's what I figured. I went to 750 because Allocaters last one sold at 750 and before that we were at 700.


[30-Jan-23 03:27 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Melon also keeps trying to buy from me. I'm going to keep one in reserve for the corp.

Melon has his own ship line, why is he buying from you?


[30-Jan-23 03:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Maybe I'm too cheap? That would free his SPF to build FTL engines.

Going too high though will risk large enough profits that others will try to enter the market.

[30-Jan-23 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I believe the other producers are limited by CBLs. Glitched Machines has been buying CBLs above MM price.. so I stopped selling them when he asked for more, because it limits his LFE produciton 😄

I will take them to other regions to sell, if needed, heh


[30-Jan-23 09:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are likely limited by either W for the CTF in the LFE, or by BE for the CBLs.


[30-Jan-23 09:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly W, BE, and HCC are all very niche materials


[30-Jan-23 11:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am limited by HCC now because I don't have enough FS.


[31-Jan-23 12:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can send me a contract for up to 600 HCC @ 500 if you want on Phobos

[11-Feb-23 09:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
what would an MFL+VCB+LHP upgrade on a starter cost?


[11-Feb-23 09:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm guessing somewhere near a million


[11-Feb-23 09:53 PM] churavis#0000
More than it's worth


[11-Feb-23 09:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
does upgrading end up costing more in parts?


[11-Feb-23 09:55 PM] churavis#0000
I don't know the exact numbers but the increase in size means you have to replace so much that you might as well just buy a new ship and have better components all around at that point


[11-Feb-23 09:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah okay


[11-Feb-23 09:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
so a lot more than a million, haha.


[11-Feb-23 09:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay, sans the VCB then, what's just an MFL+LHP? 250k or so?


[11-Feb-23 09:59 PM] churavis#0000
MFL is a good upgrade, I'm not sure why you'd want LHP though as you'll never get your money back


[11-Feb-23 09:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
I need the increased throughput, it's only 80k or so I think


[11-Feb-23 09:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
but it can cut a couple hours off either end


[11-Feb-23 09:59 PM] churavis#0000
How does LHP give increased throughput?


[11-Feb-23 10:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
faster sublight acceleration


[11-Feb-23 10:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
less time travelling


[11-Feb-23 10:04 PM] churavis#0000
Just get a WCB upgrade, it doesn't increase the volume much so you just need an LFE, 25 SSC and 16 BHP. WCB and MFL are the two optimal upgrades for the starter ship


[11-Feb-23 10:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I'm seeing less difference with LHP than I thought


[12-Feb-23 12:25 PM] rune_242#0000
how much would a puddle jumper with a LCB cost?


[12-Feb-23 12:27 PM] churavis#0000
A GEN won't cut it for an LCB or even MCB so you'll need a larger engine


[12-Feb-23 12:28 PM] rune_242#0000
do we make AEN?


[12-Feb-23 12:30 PM] rune_242#0000

MFL costs at least 150k more than the standard WCB upgrade package.


[16-Feb-23 08:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
The standard upgrade package does not contain MFL  .


[16-Feb-23 08:46 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
A standard upgrade is WCB + LFE + 25 SSC + 16 BHP so possibly just a mistake


[16-Feb-23 08:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I didn't read it properly initially and assumed it was a standard upgrade


[16-Feb-23 08:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
According to my experience, SFL is enough for WCB, unless you go to a particularly distant star field like KI to transport things.


[16-Feb-23 08:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
I converted WCB into MFL and LHP in the second upgrade, which is convenient for me to transport metal back from MOR and other places.


[16-Feb-23 08:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
LHP flies very fast, and If all ships use LHP uniformly, it will be convenient to manage ship maintenance products.


[16-Feb-23 09:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
I put LHP on all the planets I often go to, so I can repair ship at any time.


[16-Feb-23 10:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
Okay that's about what I figured. I can cover that cost


[16-Feb-23 10:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
I've found it not possible to travel from ANT to Demeter on a single tank without carrying some in the cargo.


[16-Feb-23 10:54 PM] churavis#0000
I've found MFL necessary not just for long trips but for fast ones too


[17-Feb-23 07:12 PM] yuen8241#0000

[22-Feb-23 10:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to produce a lot of MFL in deimos soon, and you can pick it up from there.


[22-Feb-23 10:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
Do you want a MSL?


[22-Feb-23 10:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
@exeler


[22-Feb-23 10:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you need MSL, I will start production. It is estimated that you can get both MFL and MSL tomorrow.


[22-Feb-23 10:16 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, I've got an order up for MFL and MSL on the CX. 150k and 100k respectively sounds good?


[22-Feb-23 10:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
yes

Do you want me to send a contract for them on Deimos and I can pull down my CX orders?

yes


[22-Feb-23 10:23 PM] yuen8241#0000
Seek some DEC, the more the better.🤩


[23-Feb-23 02:08 AM] allocater#0000
need more LHP @ 2k


[23-Feb-23 02:48 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can supply your FSE in about 24h on Heph but would be 600k rather than 500


[23-Feb-23 10:22 AM] exeler#0000
Working on it. Had some eager beavers scalp some larger orders before they made it to the CX 😅


[23-Feb-23 07:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am facing a shortage of DEC and PSL\PSM, and production of BR1 and CQM will be suspended.


[23-Feb-23 10:33 PM] exeler#0000
Contract sent 😄


[23-Feb-23 11:44 PM] syqel#0000
I have 68 LHP on Deimos to supplement demand


[23-Feb-23 11:44 PM] syqel#0000
@yuen8241 When can I get a WCB? I have everything else I need to upgrade my ship


[23-Feb-23 11:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
Did you make a reservation before, to allocator or me?


[23-Feb-23 11:51 PM] syqel#0000
I did not. Can I now?


[24-Feb-23 12:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
No problem, I produce 39 AST/FET every day, and I expect to gather enough materials in 4 days.


[24-Feb-23 12:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, if you book earlier, you can get it today. Now you need to wait for the second one.


[24-Feb-23 12:48 AM] syqel#0000
Book it! 4 days is fine


[24-Feb-23 08:05 AM] allocater#0000
I sold 3 ships via our old forum thread 😅  but now pressure is on 😬


[24-Feb-23 11:37 AM] exeler#0000
Guess I should repair my HWP then 😅 

Turns out I'd forgotten about them and they were running at like 40%

That might explain why I've had a lot less LHP than usual

I'll be dumping a bunch into the CX soon. Repaired my HWP and I'm swimming in it again. 

I had to use some for my 2k/2k, but that new ship should help me keep shipments flowing more regularly.


[02-Mar-23 01:16 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think Allocater has a shortage, but if we ever have a surplus in the future, I'll need more


[04-Mar-23 12:53 AM] syqel#0000
@yuen8241 Do you have a WCB yet? Do I need to just create a direct contract for it?


[04-Mar-23 01:15 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I produce 16 LHP per day. I guess it is needed on Heph? Or shall I just sell it on CX?


[04-Mar-23 01:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
It will be completed in 12 hours


[04-Mar-23 01:48 AM] allocater#0000
you can sell it to the CX


[06-Mar-23 11:24 AM] emperyan11#0000
Hey there fine purveyors of fine ship components! I've been a little lax in my Xboat development lately, but I still have need of some components

I have lots of STS if anyone else wants one


[06-Mar-23 11:29 AM] emperyan11#0000
Send me a contract and I can pick them up this week!


[06-Mar-23 11:29 AM] jackinabox86#0000
when I did Churavis's HYR, allocater had two FIR sitting around, so that was easy


[06-Mar-23 11:29 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if that's not the case now, it'll take time to do those as well


[06-Mar-23 11:36 AM] emperyan11#0000
Or do you just want me to buy them off the CX?


[06-Mar-23 11:37 AM] churavis#0000
No, I'll give you a cheaper price than the CX


[06-Mar-23 11:37 AM] emperyan11#0000
That works for me too, thanks!

I don't have an SPP so I can't make APT. I can make ATP in my HWP though.

❓ 

[06-Mar-23 07:24 PM] emperyan11#0000
So... did I mean to say ATP? I'll have to go check my blueprint, lol


[07-Mar-23 01:05 AM] exeler#0000
Yeah, let me know. I've been making ATP for this project. I think the ones I've been making are destined for the fancy engines you need though. I'm not sure if you need any in the final output. It looks like APT is a ship component though, and it is made out of ATP.


[07-Mar-23 07:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You probably want APT as shielding, which is fine, but you'll have to pay Exeler for that after he makes the 80 ATP I need for your engine.  For the APT, someone will need to have an SPP to make them; I don't know who that is in the corp


[07-Mar-23 02:06 PM] emperyan11#0000
APT x56 for Shielding. Correct.


[07-Mar-23 02:07 PM] emperyan11#0000
As for what goes in the Engine? Well, I don't make the sausage...


[07-Mar-23 02:07 PM] emperyan11#0000
Also, what I'm hearing is maybe I should invest in an SPP?


[07-Mar-23 02:12 PM] emperyan11#0000
Would there be any market after the boutique speed boats?


[07-Mar-23 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
I looked into an SPP and it would be very difficult to keep busy, just go buy what you need from Melon64


[07-Mar-23 02:17 PM] emperyan11#0000
Looks like the shielding is available at the Moria CX

probably the same people that have the building for each component


[22-Mar-23 01:14 PM] allocater#0000
tough question, maybe PSL/PSM or FAL/FET/AST, you can check profit margins here: https://universallogistics.app/building/ASM


[22-Mar-23 01:16 PM] gl4ucon#0000
for puddlejumpers you would need (BRS and CQT wich use subparts of the CQM and BR1 prod ) for stl engine i suppose gen and FSE are fine


[22-Mar-23 01:26 PM] gl4ucon#0000
for PSM/PSL  i am producing my own and i suppose that churavis is too


[22-Mar-23 01:26 PM] gl4ucon#0000
since it is just easier to prod it on the same base where you build cq and br


[22-Mar-23 01:26 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The list possibly just needs a line for the glass engine building?


[22-Mar-23 01:27 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I think it's the glass factory


[22-Mar-23 01:27 PM] gl4ucon#0000
well we have FSE


[22-Mar-23 01:27 PM] gl4ucon#0000
so i don't know if you would prefer GEN over FSE


[22-Mar-23 01:27 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I don't think it's common to put an FSE in a puddlejumper


[22-Mar-23 01:28 PM] gl4ucon#0000
also what i don't know how many puddlejumpers are needed per week


[22-Mar-23 01:29 PM] gl4ucon#0000
so it might not make sense to have 1 GEN line whereas we have a FSE line running


[22-Mar-23 01:55 PM] churavis#0000

[22-Mar-23 03:07 PM] churavis#0000
I make plastics on Heph, the manufacturing planet that has a manufacturing bonus, so I can get a massive manufacturing bonus for the manufactured products.

Then I ship them to Nike, the construction planet with a bonus for construction products, where I built my UPF, which is a construction building, so that I can take advantage of the construction bonus to get a construction bonus for my construction products.

I know it's crazy to put your manufacturing buildings on a manufacturing planet and your construction buildings on a construction planet, but I guess I'm just a crazy guy

also i get my subparts on heph


[22-Mar-23 03:17 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Psl and psm are very small. If you are already shipping parts from Heph it's not much of a stretch to also ship the plastics


[22-Mar-23 03:19 PM] gl4ucon#0000
fair, i am not doing that


[22-Mar-23 03:38 PM] churavis#0000
I don't go straight from Heph to Nike, my puddlejumper takes them to ANT and then a WCB ship goes ANT, Deimos then Nike. The Hub and spoke system, inspired by IRL airline companies, makes logistics so much easier.


[22-Mar-23 03:41 PM] gl4ucon#0000
yes, i have the same system, but i dont like to ship psl/psm


[22-Mar-23 03:45 PM] archielvahr#0000

[23-Mar-23 03:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe only LHP. I won't produce it.


[23-Mar-23 03:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
LHP needs too much AL. Considering that I already have 9 PP2 and 5 ASM, I can't afford to produce LHP any more.


[23-Mar-23 02:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
What's the preferred FTL engine type? Is it QCRs, and why if so? Charge times seem to be so little of the whole jump


[23-Mar-23 04:05 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
It's probably because there is not much difference in price so why not go with the better one? It's kind of the same with ENG vs FSE but FSE is quite a bit better for maybe only 200k difference


[23-Mar-23 04:06 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The difference is only 10 AST vs 20 BGO and a few extra hours of build time


[23-Mar-23 04:23 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The FSE price wars have begun

[23-Mar-23 04:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
but is it better? The parsec/hour is reduced by 10%, and that matters a lot more than a 5x decrease in charge time


[23-Mar-23 04:33 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The QCR is faster when you use more fuel


[23-Mar-23 04:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
Like a 10 parsec jump at 100% reactor usage takes 7.5min to charge up but then takes 3:11 hr to traverse. Swapping the exact same ship to Quickcharge reduces charge to 1:18min but increases traversal to 3:36

its reactor power is lower so it's slower


[23-Mar-23 04:34 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Not according to the blueprint test flight

your difference in time is on the station approach, your jumps are slower


[23-Mar-23 04:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's the glitch with the game's flight route finder, there's often two different routes with the same fuel use, but one has a much closer jump point, so it's faster


[23-Mar-23 04:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
just click the reactor usage a few times, you'll see it switch even though you're not changing the fuel usage


[23-Mar-23 04:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
just forcing it to recalculate

[23-Mar-23 04:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
so back to the question, I don't see regular reactors on the ship parts list, are they available regularly, or only the QCRs?


[23-Mar-23 04:47 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Sure. I don't currently make RCS though, Allocator has been supplying them for the QCR I built. It's next on my list to build. I just built a third AML.


[23-Mar-23 11:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
How much does it usually cost to upgrade a starter ship?  I'm starting to find that my starter ships don't carry as much as I want


[23-Mar-23 11:25 PM] churavis#0000
I believe the prices in the ship status channel are still relevant


[24-Mar-23 01:21 AM] draconisdomini#0000
If I'm looking at the blueprint I want to upgrade to, what I need is the difference between that parts list and the parts list for a starter ship, right?

I was just comparing the two blueprints.  Looks like it would cost just under a million.


[24-Mar-23 09:53 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
It should on be about 500k what list of parts are you looking at? The normal upgrade is in the pinned messages https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/944644507050323968/993577413827121326


[24-Mar-23 09:59 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I was looking at this list


[24-Mar-23 10:00 PM] draconisdomini#0000
And thinking it might make sense to upgrade the fuel tanks at the same time


[24-Mar-23 10:03 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That would be WCB + 1 LFE + MFL + MSL + 19 BHP + 32 SSC


[24-Mar-23 10:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Up to you but you can still fly around a few of the close by planets before refueling


[24-Mar-23 10:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I would just do MFL, you don't really need much extra SF with the regular engine


[24-Mar-23 11:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
LFL is useless. My ship only has MFL, and even if I fly to MOR, I don't lack FF.


[25-Mar-23 01:32 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Fair enough, maybe I'll skip at least the MSL then

I can provide BR1, CQS or CQM，LFE、MFE、SFE，FFC


[26-Mar-23 10:52 PM] martin1194#0000
then, seem I only need FSE QCR SSC


[26-Mar-23 11:12 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can do FSE and QCR for 600k each, just need to get some RAG from Allocater

I have 12 WAL on Deimos


[02-Apr-23 05:08 AM] _bojidar#0000
well this new ship sellng model isnt nice..i want to buy 2-3 ships but i cant find all parts/people to get it and themn all at different places..


[02-Apr-23 05:09 AM] _bojidar#0000
cant we set for example deimos or heph or what ever to be a place for all ship part trades and we order them at one place may be?


[02-Apr-23 05:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe ANT is a good place, but not everyone is willing to do so.


[02-Apr-23 05:11 AM] _bojidar#0000
so we put ads and all who produce something..get it and deliver..many parts same time..instead each part moved from different place


[02-Apr-23 05:13 AM] _bojidar#0000
sure Ant is ok too..but its like a chaos now..dont know how allocater did it before but its not work as it is..at least imo

[02-Apr-23 05:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
Obviously, he is asking every producer to ship it to heph for him.


[02-Apr-23 05:15 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
What do you use all your ships for? You must have a 2k ship for each base at this point?


[02-Apr-23 05:15 AM] _bojidar#0000
may be Ant isnt best as you cant use ads..while i think we for example 5 people put ads for LFL..and then who can produce these can see and take as many as he can produce and deliver it..while with contrs may be a bit more complicated


[02-Apr-23 05:16 AM] _bojidar#0000
i do tons of hauls on main 3 lx and its quiet nice profit


[02-Apr-23 05:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
The problem is that not everyone have enough warehouses in heph. I don't think it's a big problem for people who buy boats to issue contracts and transport them themselves because they don't buy boats every day. On the contrary, it's annoying for shipbuilders to issue contracts.


[02-Apr-23 05:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
I believe alloctor  gave up the original way because it was very complicated.


[02-Apr-23 05:19 AM] _bojidar#0000
well there are 2x500 warehouse which is enough for most parts... but sure lets make it elsewhere with more warehouses then


[02-Apr-23 05:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have to say that in view of the increasing number of our members, I will only give priority to selling ships and some scarce products at preferential prices to active members who have made long-term contributions to corp


[02-Apr-23 05:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
Especially the partners who provide me with raw materials  for shipbuilding or other necessities.


[02-Apr-23 05:33 AM] _bojidar#0000
well its ok..but many of us pay full price for ships...without any preferentials...and again i ask first here and want to buy from corp as it support corp producers..


[02-Apr-23 05:34 AM] _bojidar#0000
and you dont count this as a contribution to the corp obviously


[02-Apr-23 05:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
My previous shipbuilding products sold well in cx, and I sold them to Corp at more favorable prices. Actually, I was particularly short of boats. You can notice that I was the biggest boat buyer of Corp until allocator raised the price.😄


[02-Apr-23 05:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have always hoped to build a huge fleet for cx trade. I can sell those parts I don't need at  all four CX .


[02-Apr-23 05:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
I noticed that you have bases in SE-648C and deimos, but you have never sold Ti or Tio to me or other members of Corp, and you haven't sold FF or AL internally for a long time. I always thought that only Habix produced Tio.😅

[02-Apr-23 05:47 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Contribution to the corp is usually viewed as supplying some goods at a reasonable discount to the CX if possible, most goods are easily sold regardless of who the buyer is


[02-Apr-23 05:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
Another way to contribute is to donate to the infrastructure of the planet we rule. Considering that everyone can get 80kAIC from Corp every week, these dividends come from the governors' infrastructure maintenance expenses.


[02-Apr-23 05:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
Although Churavis is always opposed to the divestiture of phobos, I believe he will be glad that others have donated materials to phobos' infrastructure.

[02-Apr-23 07:16 AM] allocater#0000
before, I had to collect all components on heph, but it was a lot of effort. If there are no over-bidders on ANT, one could simply put ANT requests now at the corp price and wait for fulfillment. ANT also has enough space to collect multiple ships.


[02-Apr-23 07:22 AM] allocater#0000
or if someone wants to be component shipper, they can collect all components and organize all contracts to stockpile ship-packages on heph. Depending on if that service is valued with a high-enough bonus payment.

You guessed correctly, if you want to buy something you usually have to arrange it.

[06-Apr-23 01:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
After a while, when I have enough cash flow, I can consider buying some ship parts and selling the whole ship. After all, I have bases on all shipbuilding planets. It is not a problem to ship a few extra parts when transporting my own parts.

[06-Apr-23 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, I didn't make any AFR and all my planets are out of upkeep, so I don't think I can do any at my FS


[06-Apr-23 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
if it's impossible to find anyone else, I'll ship some stuff to A2b and knock them out


[06-Apr-23 12:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
for the record, I have found Bojidar to be the worst part of playing this game for nearly a year.  He bought ships ahead of people who spoke in discord and traded actively with the corp.  We're a friendly bunch who cooperate with one another, so I didn't want to bring too much drama, but I think it speaks volumes that the only time he ever really spoke up on Discord was when he stopped getting cheap and easy ships.  I will not miss him.  Will miss many of you though!

No, to commission a ship means to order it built, but it sounds more official


[08-Apr-23 09:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
It doesn't help when "commissioning" uses "commission" in the definition. 😆  But it means "to officially request" something... or to pay for something to be delivered later

I make engines on Heph but usually end up moving them to ANT, I haven't had many internal buyers but I can make nearly 1x FSE a day so you wouldn't have to wait long

I've had success with just putting the buy ads up on the CX then announcing here what I needed. 

That'll become less useful for internal orders the more busy the CX gets.


[09-Apr-23 09:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, CX is more convenient for those who know what parts they want, and it is also more beneficial for manufacturers.

All standard components are currently on the CX for 5.2mil 🥳


[10-Apr-23 05:20 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I filled the FSE, two QCR finish in about a day on Heph, you could send a contract there instead if that works?


[10-Apr-23 05:21 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I would generally prefer contracts for the engines anyway, selling to low buys on the CX pushes the historical price down.


[10-Apr-23 05:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can cancel the cx order and send you a contract. If you like, I can issue several long-term contracts.


[10-Apr-23 05:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have no plans to build a new base recently, so buying some ship parts has little financial pressure on me.


[10-Apr-23 05:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
What I can assure you is that the ship I assembled with your parts will only be sold to active and contributing people of Corp.  If I sell to someone other than this, I will ask your advice in advance.


[10-Apr-23 05:30 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have no problem selling my output but if you need them feel free to send a contract. I can get 1.2mil for an FSE at Moria but it does require a lot of laundering to get something useful back to Ant.


[10-Apr-23 05:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
I designed a template for this, which is much more convenient.😄

Where should I set contracts for picking up ship parts?


[13-Apr-23 08:07 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
To the individuals that make them, they should all be on the spreadsheet


[13-Apr-23 08:08 PM] syqel#0000
I meant which planet?


[13-Apr-23 08:09 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
That would differ depending on who you are getting them from. I suppose that would be good to have on the spreadsheet.


[13-Apr-23 08:09 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Maybe a more dedicated ship parts suppliers spreadsheet would be better than the general one

{Reactions}

[13-Apr-23 08:18 PM] emperyan11#0000
So, when you say "the spreadsheet" are you talking about the pinned one ⏫ 
Because I'm still looking for a producer for an HYR and there's no one there now that Jackinabox has stepped away from the game...


[13-Apr-23 08:22 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yes that spreadsheet. HYR is not a usual part to make. The spreadsheet is intended to have items on it that a players makes on a regular basis. If you are looking for someone to make HYR then it would stand to reason that anyone with an SPF could theoretically make one and there is a separate sheet with the buildings that people have. I have a number of PP3 but don't list INS as something I sell for example even though I could make it.


[13-Apr-23 08:23 PM] emperyan11#0000
That's fair. It *is* a rarity...


[13-Apr-23 08:26 PM] emperyan11#0000
So, I guess the question is who's got an SPF that wants to print an HYR? I've got all the parts...


[13-Apr-23 08:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can, you can contract them to me on Heph


[13-Apr-23 08:40 PM] emperyan11#0000
Perfect. I'll get it set up. Thank you.


[14-Apr-23 07:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have given you WCB. The rest will take several days to produce.

Then I remember the contract wrong. Your WCB is being produced. Why don't you pick up the goods at ANT🤣


[14-Apr-23 09:26 PM] syqel#0000
Sorry. I didn't know where to set the location and I saw that your SKF is on Deimos - I can ship it there if you want to send me a shipping contract. My ship is almost there


[14-Apr-23 09:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter, because of your order, I produced a extra WCB

[17-Apr-23 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's kind of frustrating how much the devs just let someone else do that work for them, we should really have all those "empire building tools" inside of the empire building game


[17-Apr-23 02:35 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Effectively there are more people working on tools outside the game than the actual game itself, investment in the game to grow it seems low


[17-Apr-23 02:36 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Also these tools didn't exist in the last universe and you could have as many bases as you wanted


[17-Apr-23 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess they still make more of their money off SimAirport than PrUn


[17-Apr-23 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
from my experience with people adding APIs to games, with just a few exceptions, it seems to become a giant time sink and outright fail half the time


[17-Apr-23 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Saganaki is definitely an integral part of the "dev team" in my eyes though 😄


[17-Apr-23 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah, that's my point, he's definitely providing an integral part of the game


[17-Apr-23 02:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think the devs recognize that, he is marked a mod after all, but really all that functionality should be in the game itself instead of outside


[17-Apr-23 03:10 PM] churavis#0000
Some people find building tools for the game more fun than playing the game itself.


[17-Apr-23 03:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, for sure, and I wouldn't argue for a base planner or anything like that - there's plenty of options


[17-Apr-23 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
but something so critical to maintaining active empires of even a few planets in size, I think at least a basic option should be available


[17-Apr-23 03:18 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
You can't put a FIO equivalent in the game without also providing a way to get the data out for other tooling like an external base planner. FIO and Prunner are a big part of the reason I can scale effectively in game without spending more and more time managing all those bases


[17-Apr-23 03:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm not saying lock the existing data out, just that this is a feature that should be available in game. Since most of the game runs on flat API calls, I think if they added a window with this info, you'd be able to connect to the same API endpoint and retrieve that data


[17-Apr-23 03:46 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Absolutely but they don't have the resources so do much of anything.

{Reactions}
😢 

[17-Apr-23 04:36 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Perhaps I ask this because I'm not in IT, but if a modder can do it, why can't the developer?


[17-Apr-23 04:37 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
They have different goals really


[17-Apr-23 04:38 PM] churavis#0000
The developer could, but development resources are limited and why reinvent the wheel?

Wouldn't you rather they spent time on new features?


[17-Apr-23 05:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
well we say that, until whoever is making the wheels decides to stop


[17-Apr-23 05:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
and then, wheel-less, we'll all say "well, why doesn't the car manufacturer make the wheels?" as we all sit around with useless, wheel-less cars


[17-Apr-23 05:38 PM] exeler#0000
It's also a matter of supporting it and making sure it meets the standards the game has set forth. 

If the developers make the feature, the players will expect a certain level of quality and that it fits the theme of the game. 

If FIO goes down, that doesn't look bad on the game. If FIO's UI is bad or had a bad user experience, it doesn't really look bad on the game itself. 

Also remember that the modders are just as likely to have the skills required to implement something as the dev team does. Maybe the devs on the dev team don't have quite as much experience building a high throughout, durable API like FIO as the FIO dev does. 

Maybe the existing prosperous universe codebase wouldn't be suitable for supporting an FIO like use case or scale for how much it is used. So it would be a significant undertaking to build something integrated or too expensive to double up their infrastructure costs for what will appear to be a simple feature. 

There's a LOT that goes into deciding what should or shouldn't be in a game. Modders typically have the luxury of not needing to worry about a lot of that and that typically lets them act and iterate faster.


[18-Apr-23 03:17 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
They just need more SDs and SLs. I mean, if their simulation can do it, why can't they?


[18-Apr-23 06:54 AM] domicius#0000
We just need to ship them some WAIs...


[18-Apr-23 06:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
The information of production, consumption and remaining inventory time is the basis of playing this game. If my PRUN empire is based on the mod developed by the players who may collapse at any time, it would be too bad, which is the function that the game should have.


[18-Apr-23 06:59 AM] domicius#0000
I agree, obvs. Otherwise I'd have to go back to having a spreadsheet for each planet telling me how much to restock. FIO took a lot of the spreadsheet work away - but it might be that the dev were aiming for that level of (low) usability. See also Dwarf Fortress


[18-Apr-23 07:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
It depends on the positioning of the game, whether to let players enjoy the process of making game tools or to let players enjoy the game itself.


[18-Apr-23 07:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
But the spreadsheet can't solve a problem, that is, I need to input the inventory data of my 22 bases, which is too difficult considering that I have hundreds of products and raw materials.

I'm betting the idea here is to have something you can quickly get those small cargoes where you need them - So what's better, this or paying more to have someone else ship it for you that's going that way already?

[26-Apr-23 04:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I put ENG on the CX at the same price as FSE to make the FSE look more attractive because that's what I mostly make, people still buy them, I might do the same with RCT 💸


[26-Apr-23 04:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think they really are the same price, but also RCT are just faster. I don't know why everyone thinks QCR are faster, they travel 20% slower per parsec

[26-Apr-23 05:34 PM] churavis#0000
Rarely will anyone run their ships at max speed and it isn't necessarily relevant to the difference between to engines at other speeds


[26-Apr-23 05:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's fair, and the way flight routing is setup the MIN is actually different for both engines. You can see by the % increments that the RCT has a wider operating range, and FF to FF, the QCR is slightly more efficient since its advantage doesn't require using additional FF.

So since the speed is tied to the %, where 100% of RCT is 2.3ps on this ship and 100% of QCR is 2.1ps, you'll have to use more FF all the time. But the potential advantage is greatest on those long trips where you want to be there quickly.


[26-Apr-23 05:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
and if ships are your greatest logistic hurdle, then an RCT makes more sense. But if you're good with slowboating all the time, then QCR is marginally faster


[26-Apr-23 05:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
the same Demeter route, but now you can see the advantage is swapped. Notice fuel usage is actually the same here, meaning both engines are operating at the same speed. But QCR is advantaged because charge time is not tied to FF usage

[26-Apr-23 05:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
I find I run these ships at or near max FF a lot more often then min, since the difference in fuel usage is often only a couple thousand but the time savings is quite large


[27-Apr-23 03:45 AM] allocater#0000
I find there are too much diminishing returns, so I mostly run with ~200 SF and ~200 FF


[27-Apr-23 04:32 AM] domicius#0000
I guess mostly I make slow return trips.


[27-Apr-23 04:33 AM] domicius#0000
Saves on fuel, and for whatever my setup is, there's not a massive time difference past 50.%


[27-Apr-23 07:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
I agree 100% with SF travel, you don't get much after 25% or so. FF travel seems to scale much better, especially on longer routes


[27-Apr-23 09:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
which makes sense, SF is momentum based travel in a system and it's restricted by the max G-force. FF travel is linear based on fuel spent, more fuel means faster parsec transversal. There is no acceleration above lightspeed, I guess? lol

[28-Apr-23 04:37 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Is the spreadsheet correct that only Yuen has an SKF? Anyone wanting to get into ship building that wants to start with an SKF? It's relatively low barrier to entry for ship building.


[28-Apr-23 09:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's probably correct. It's hard for the whole corp to keep a single SKF busy, since each one can use almost ~200 AST + 200 FET per day


[28-Apr-23 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, my entire Deimos setup is about ASM and it can do maybe 25% of those needs


[28-Apr-23 07:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
So if @yuen8241 had another ASM supplier instead we would be better off? Who doesn't have a Deimos or Vulcan base and wants to help with this? I can provide a large amount of the lfabs from what I have in stock.


[28-Apr-23 07:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
There is currently only a single WCB available on all the CXs


[28-Apr-23 09:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
The problem now is that I have five LCBs and two WCBs. WCBs are sold too fast and ASM suppliers sell me too few FETs.


[28-Apr-23 09:31 PM] yuen8241#0000
The quantity of ASM is absolutely sufficient, and WCB is unsalable for a long time until now.


[28-Apr-23 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll adjust to FET

{Reactions}
🦶 

[29-Apr-23 12:37 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Have you been selling to the CX or just for in-corp demand?


[29-Apr-23 01:12 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I have 3 ASM on Deimos to supply @yuen8241. But to produce FET I would need more FE, which I don't produce myself.


[29-Apr-23 01:31 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Do you have a base on Vulcan?


[29-Apr-23 01:31 AM] neth_havoc#0000
No


[29-Apr-23 01:32 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
It's very convenient to have a second metallurgy base in the same system that can do FE


[29-Apr-23 07:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
My five ASM have been switched to FET production.


[29-Apr-23 07:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
The previous sales of WCB were very poor, so I stopped producing it, and only a few of them were exchanged for other cx currencies.


[29-Apr-23 07:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
I will have 3 WCB stocks in deimos tomorrow, so you don't have to switch to FET.


[29-Apr-23 07:46 AM] churavis#0000
I have plenty of HSE in stock on Nike if you decide to make a base on Vulcan


[29-Apr-23 09:19 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Maybe i will do that after my REF base.


[02-May-23 11:16 PM] draconisdomini#0000
For a glass STL ship, what is the best size cargo bay to use?


[02-May-23 11:18 PM] churavis#0000
Most use a 500/500 as the glass engine isn't really powerful enough for anything bigger and a fully loaded 1000/1000 would go twice as slow


[02-May-23 11:19 PM] churavis#0000
I have a BRS, CQT and GEN in stock if you decide to build one


[02-May-23 11:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm preparing to build bases on IId and IIg, so I need another ship and it seemed like a glass STL was the sensible way to go


[02-May-23 11:22 PM] draconisdomini#0000
How much do you charge for those parts?


[02-May-23 11:24 PM] churavis#0000
BRS 200K
CQT 130K
GEN 120K


[02-May-23 11:25 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Great.  I'll send you some contracts.  I can buy the other parts on the CX


[02-May-23 11:26 PM] churavis#0000

"I made a bunch of both" is a bit of an understatement; it' quite an impressive output you got. How many HWPs do you have running? And how are you getting the AL for them?!


[04-May-23 07:26 AM] yuen8241#0000

[04-May-23 07:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can sent contract to me now


[04-May-23 05:33 PM] exeler#0000
I have 3 HWP on Deimos running non-stop. 

I smelt my own AL, but buy all the ALO I need.

Getting the plates off Deimos and to the CX is usually my bottleneck 😅


[04-May-23 10:28 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I will happily buy 43 LHP from you on Deimos


[04-May-23 11:22 PM] exeler#0000

LFLs aren't priced on the sheet though

400k


[06-May-23 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
Really? That seems pretty high. The ones sold randomly at Moria are 320-350


[06-May-23 12:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
It'd be cheaper for me to build an SKF and buy the ZR and then tear it down once it's done  😅


[06-May-23 02:06 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Perhaps you should look into filling the need on the cx, and make some dosh while you do.


[06-May-23 03:25 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Most SKF products are in short supply on the CX, you could probably do quite well if you could keep one supplied


[06-May-23 03:51 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
"if you could keep one supplied" is the operative part there I think


[06-May-23 05:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
Even so, an idle SKF is not the expensive. I didn't realize it was just technicians, so maybe I'll do just that and let it idle


[06-May-23 09:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can wait in MOR for 30 days to buy an LFL.

[06-May-23 09:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
ZR is 13.5k right now, that comes out to 271k for an LFL. Just saying 50% profit is a lot


[06-May-23 09:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
and making ZR is about 6k, so if you make your own ZR then cost of LFL goes down to 121k


[06-May-23 09:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
meaning you're making 3x profit on corp


[06-May-23 09:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
just seems a bit off, is all


[06-May-23 09:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
So I can sell an LFL every day?


[06-May-23 09:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
I assume you buy the ZR from corpmates for cheap


[06-May-23 09:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
So my AML, ASM and SME, factories that exist for SKF, are all highly profitable? Can I produce so many SKF products and sell them every day? Have you considered the overall profit of the base?


[06-May-23 09:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
mmm, yeah I'm not complaining about the other prices really, just the FF fuel tanks seem too much


[06-May-23 09:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
most of your other stuff seems fair


[06-May-23 09:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
so in this case ASM and SME aren't counting, I'm just talking about the AML and SKF


[06-May-23 09:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
Even if I produce SKF products every day, the profit of deimos base is only 80k per day, and I have to build an additional SME base with 50k profit to maintain it. If it's to make money, why don't I just build two electronics bases or chemistry bases?


[06-May-23 09:29 PM] churavis#0000
The product isn't even available on the CX. Any price is better than no product


[06-May-23 09:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
seems the best answer here is to just make my own SKF


[06-May-23 09:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
its maintenance is like 1k/d


[06-May-23 09:33 PM] churavis#0000
If you can source the inputs without nuking the market, go for it


[06-May-23 09:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
I mean I have 4 ASMs, I'll just idle it otherwise


[06-May-23 09:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have successfully bankrupted competitors other than corp before, which is why SKF products are in short supply.


[06-May-23 09:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can do it and see if SKF makes so much money.


[06-May-23 09:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
well some competition would be good 🙂


[06-May-23 09:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
Anyway, my advantage is that I can provide the whole ship.


[06-May-23 09:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
idk how you bankrupt anyone here, maybe they just drop that market


[06-May-23 09:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I'm sure that proper variety would prevent such a thing - though would be cool to know I guess


[06-May-23 09:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
Quite simply, SKF's product market is very small, as long as a little price change will lead to unprofitable.


[06-May-23 09:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have five ASM and five AML, and I will sell the whole ship. And my main source of profit is not here. As my ASM supplier, we all make money. If you produce SKF products yourself, I believe we will not make money as before.


[06-May-23 09:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
then lower the prices of the *FLs to make sense


[06-May-23 09:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
an LFL shouldn't cost more than 250k in corp and MFL no more than 125k


[06-May-23 09:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's the only ones I have a problem with


[06-May-23 09:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
Very good, then you can sell FET and AST to me at the price of 860AIC, which is also calculated according to your way.


[06-May-23 09:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then sell me ZR for 1.6k


[06-May-23 09:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
what?


[06-May-23 09:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
it takes 20 ZR to make an LFL


[06-May-23 09:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
not 200


[06-May-23 09:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
Didn't you calculate the cost price? The cost price of FET is 860AIC.


[06-May-23 09:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
depends on if you source the TIO yourself, I don't. My cost for FET is 1060


[06-May-23 09:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make the 340 on top, a paltry 25% profit


[06-May-23 09:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
and that's including all my personal discounts for RATs, DWs, GIN, ALE, etc. etc.


[06-May-23 09:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I hardly make anything


[06-May-23 09:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
I also showed the trading volume of CX, and I doubt if I can sell one LFL every month. All scarce customized products are like this, with high profits and low turnover. Don't set the cost price rules for people, or you will go to cx to buy it yourself or make it yourself.


[06-May-23 09:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
exactly, that's why I sell it so cheap


[06-May-23 09:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
because it has limited market and it's pretty internal


[06-May-23 09:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
like I see your cost on my selling AST for LCB is 283k and you sell for 350k - that's totally fair


[06-May-23 09:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
but your cost on 8k ZR (let's assume from balbar) for LFL is 161k, and you're selling for 400k


[06-May-23 09:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then don't sell me ASM products in the future, and make your own SKF products. All the prices are what both want, not what one party imposes on the other.


[06-May-23 09:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
mmmmk


[06-May-23 09:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
SKF's main profit sources are MFL and LFL. Without these two, it will not make money at all, and the overall profit will fall to 500k .


[06-May-23 09:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
This price has remained unchanged for a long time, since shipbuilding began.


[06-May-23 09:53 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, the price of something is ultimately what the buyer and seller agree on. 

If there's a buyer that is willing to pay 400k and a seller who is willing to part with it for 400k, then the price is 400k.


[06-May-23 09:54 PM] exeler#0000
Buyer is free to demand stupid prices, seller is free to set stupid prices. But if they do they risk not finding a seller or buyer respectively.


[06-May-23 09:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
true


[06-May-23 09:54 PM] churavis#0000
I demand stupid prices all the time and there's always someone willing to pay them eventually

{Reactions}
this 

[06-May-23 09:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, I can sell it in cx at 400k or even higher, but you can't buy any LFL at 22.5k .


[06-May-23 10:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that SKF's meager profit era is coming to an end, and it will enter an unprofitable era, but at least my workload has been reduced.😄


[06-May-23 10:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
it is still a game, you should definitely enjoy it 🙂


[06-May-23 10:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, when I don't know how to spend my money, I can burn money in a competition again.


[06-May-23 10:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
well I'm really only going to be making parts for corp


[06-May-23 10:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
Very good, I only build the whole ship for Corp from the members, otherwise I will earn at least more than one million by disassembling it and selling it in cx.


[06-May-23 10:18 PM] churavis#0000
If you don't build an SKF production line then someone else will, the market abhors a vacuum


[06-May-23 10:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
SKF is not the bottleneck, ASM is.


[06-May-23 10:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
SKF is idle most of the time.


[06-May-23 10:20 PM] churavis#0000
That's why I said "SKF production line" not just SKF, because that would include all the buildings needed to build the inputs for it


[06-May-23 10:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Roughly how many ASM do you need to keep a SKF full?


[06-May-23 10:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
about 20


[06-May-23 10:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then there are about 70 SMEs


[06-May-23 10:28 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Surely looking at the trading volume on the CX is pointless if there is no supply? The volume for FSE was pretty poor until players could reliably buy one off the CX too.


[06-May-23 10:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
I used to sell MFL in all cx, which was much better than LFL and the sales volume was not high.


[06-May-23 10:52 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I just did a plan in Prunner for an SKF and the bottleneck doesn't seem to be ASM but rather the ridiculous amount of TI needed as an input. 14 ASM pair well with 1 SKF on Deimos for a 750 base making MSL, MFL and WCB but it requires 160+ TI.


[06-May-23 10:53 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Sometimes I sell lots of FSE in a week, sometimes I sell none 🤷‍♂️


[06-May-23 11:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah it takes like 2 bases worth of SME for that much TIO


[06-May-23 11:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
The problem is that the number of MFL+MSL is less than that of WCB+LCB, because many people buy WCB to upgrade the initial ship.


[06-May-23 11:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you set them to 1: 1: 1: 1, it must be wrong.


[06-May-23 11:25 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
It's not wrong it just optimizes for less TI, keeping the SKF running and producing more new ships for cheaper. Having all the parts for new ships on the CX cheaper helps everyone.


[06-May-23 11:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
There is no market for additional MFL and MSL, because the capacity of WCB and LCB sold with them is limited.


[06-May-23 11:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
It is nothing more than changing from the current price to the MFL price of 150k and the WCB price of 400K .


[06-May-23 11:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
Obviously, considering that many new players will use WCB to upgrade their initial ships, it is more beneficial for them that I make money through MFL instead of WCB.


[07-May-23 01:47 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Without having a constant supply on the  CXs you can't really say there is no market for new ship products from the SKF, all the players buying FSE off me must be buying them from somewhere


[07-May-23 01:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
I believe there is enough MFL in the market.


[07-May-23 01:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
As for LCB and WCB, they are limited by raw materials rather than SKF capacity.


[07-May-23 01:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there are not enough WCB and LCB in the market, MFL can't be sold no matter how many.

[08-May-23 11:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Does anyone make RCT, or is the QCR just that much better?


[08-May-23 11:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can


[08-May-23 11:30 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Usually people want QCR but the differences are minor except QCR needs BGO which is slightly harder to get than AST because I don't have a gold source


[09-May-23 01:15 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Is there a significant cost difference?  If not I guess it just makes sense to go for the QCR


[09-May-23 06:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
QCR is only better if you regularly use minimum fuel. RCT has higher speed and will be better if you regularly want minimum time


[09-May-23 06:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
And if you're using minimum fuel, you don't really care about time, so really either works


[09-May-23 02:46 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
There is no cost difference.


[09-May-23 02:47 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have bumped the price of both FTL engines to 650, most of my inputs for those are from others


[09-May-23 10:24 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ok, sounds like RCT would be my preference then.  I often want at least a little above minimum fuel

[03-Jun-23 10:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
The internal price makes me feel tired. The market is constantly fluctuating, so long as there is no cost accounting for a period of time, it will lead to problems.If the purchase price is too low or the selling price is too expensive, it will lead to opposition. Not as free as cx makes me feel.

Anyone got an LCB?  Last component I need


[11-Jun-23 09:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
@parisinspringtime I need a longer lead time on the contract, can you give it a week. Also better if you put location as Deimos if possible, fine as ANT if you don't have a base there.

👍 

[11-Jun-23 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
I can get an LCB in a week


[11-Jun-23 09:21 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I've been waiting a while, so that's probably my best option


[12-Jun-23 07:01 AM] rune_242#0000
maybe I should get in to the SKF bussines


[12-Jun-23 09:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's more a lack of ASM


[12-Jun-23 09:32 AM] rune_242#0000
I can fix that too


[12-Jun-23 09:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
then it's a lack of TIO 😉


[12-Jun-23 09:33 AM] rune_242#0000
To me it just sounds like more money for me🤩


[12-Jun-23 09:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
ehh, it's not the most profitable business if you mostly serve in-corp


[12-Jun-23 09:39 AM] rune_242#0000
No?
What's the price for alloys in corp?


[12-Jun-23 09:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'll buy at 1400


[12-Jun-23 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
and with cargo bays at 325k, cost of AST/FET about 1050 to manufacture means my entire Deimos base makes like 30k/d


[12-Jun-23 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
I get my TIO at in-corp prices though


[12-Jun-23 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
so that's part of why I figure it's most fair to sell internally as well - first and foremost


[12-Jun-23 09:49 AM] rune_242#0000
LCB can be sold on the CX between 500k-480k


[12-Jun-23 09:49 AM] rune_242#0000
maybe even higher


[12-Jun-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
yes, but like I said, I sell mine internally


[12-Jun-23 09:52 AM] rune_242#0000
I see


[12-Jun-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
haven't been able to sell but maybe 1 on the market


[12-Jun-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
but if you make the full chain yourself, do whatever you want 🙂


[12-Jun-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
I just feel obligated since I buy TIO internally


[12-Jun-23 09:53 AM] rune_242#0000
I'm glad for that


[14-Jun-23 04:11 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Looking for 1 MFL and 1 MSL


[14-Jun-23 06:03 PM] hernanduer#0000

Just a ballpark to figure out if I'll need a loan or if I can save it up.


[14-Jun-23 10:10 PM] exeler#0000
I don't know the exact number these days, especially if you're gonna be buying pieces individually from people, but I think it's around 3-5 mil


[14-Jun-23 10:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah expect at least 4mil


[14-Jun-23 10:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
For LCB ship, WCB might be 3.5 and VCB probably 5


[15-Jun-23 09:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
can I order a BR1 and CQM?


[15-Jun-23 09:28 AM] rune_242#0000
does anybody sell FFC?


[15-Jun-23 09:28 AM] rune_242#0000
I'll pay full price


[15-Jun-23 09:31 AM] rune_242#0000
a lot of items are sold out


[15-Jun-23 09:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
allocater makes them


[15-Jun-23 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have an FFC on Heph, send a contract using a price from the sheet for it


[15-Jun-23 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
I make them very slowly among other components


[15-Jun-23 10:20 AM] rune_242#0000
I did not find an FFC price


[15-Jun-23 10:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
check the pinned post in this channel for the FTL ship sheet


[15-Jun-23 10:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think most prices are there rather than in the corp prices sheet

do you ever sell anything in corp? I never see any auctions

I know yuen makes full ships but it's his discretion to sell them


[15-Jun-23 03:18 PM] allocater#0000
a full ship would be on the ANT CX ...except fuel tanks and ~~CQM~~ ~~CQR~~ QCR


[15-Jun-23 03:19 PM] churavis#0000
If I ever catch up with the corp I'll put up some CQM

I've got a bunch of afabs stockpiled for the REP center (which have been stockpiled for many months now...) Post what you need and I can see what I can supply. I also have 44 WAL, 160 W, and 10k BTS on ANT.  Prices are on the corp sheet (if they aren't listed under my name, just use someone else's price). BTS is 200/u

If anyone else wants to get some LHP/BHP to top up their ship status, I just put up auctions in #auctions

Protip: You can use the `Change Max Bid Amount` button to set your bid to the number you need so you don't accidentally end up buying 500+ LHP

Don't know if it's been discussed, but are the new parts actually worthwhile? Or are QCR & FSE still the standard, and the others still golden elephants only used in meme-builds?

Damn right, sooo glad I put an HPR in mine on a whim


[19-Jul-23 08:22 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm in need of a BR1, CQL, VCB, FSE and QCR


[19-Jul-23 08:39 AM] churavis#0000
I have a BR1 and CQL in stock on ANT already


[19-Jul-23 08:40 AM] melon164#0000
I have QCR on ANT


[19-Jul-23 08:41 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Shall I just buy them off you on the CX then?


[19-Jul-23 08:41 AM] melon164#0000
I could make VCB in ~8d, but I expect someone else can get there faster


[19-Jul-23 08:42 AM] melon164#0000
Put up a QCR@675k bid on ANT, I'll fill

[19-Jul-23 08:45 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I put up buy orders for BR1 at 700k and CQL at 900k too

I always overcharge on the CX and I've got more in stock than what's on there, send me a contract using prices on the FTL sheet

What price is it?


[19-Jul-23 05:52 PM] churavis#0000

Does anyone have an FSE (or ENG), and/or a VCB?


[20-Jul-23 09:57 AM] melon164#0000
I can make you ENG in 18h, VCB in ~8d


[20-Jul-23 09:58 AM] allocater#0000
we have 4 VCB hanging on ANT


[20-Jul-23 09:59 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Usual spreadsheet price?


[20-Jul-23 10:01 AM] allocater#0000
sadly no, since they were bought at the CX price, at least for me, maybe Hernanduer can go down


[20-Jul-23 10:02 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Ah, ok.  The CX price isn't that much higher anyway.  I'll just buy it from you there

[20-Jul-23 10:07 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I'll wait another day or so to see if anyone has an FSE (I'm going to be primarily running it between Ant IIg and Ant IId so the fuel saving is pretty useful), but if not I'll take you up on the ENG


[20-Jul-23 10:08 AM] churavis#0000
Do we need more SKF capacity?


[20-Jul-23 10:14 AM] draconisdomini#0000
We did have a couple of people leave recently


[20-Jul-23 12:27 PM] melon164#0000
I doubt we need more SKF per se, it's almost impossible to keep one of those monsters fed!  But we could well need more ASM/SME-TI capacity


[20-Jul-23 12:28 PM] melon164#0000
I could make you FSE as well, but it sounded like @mrtcsmith has loads


[20-Jul-23 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
Is there anyone with excess TIO capacity or would we need to increase that as well to increase TI production?


[20-Jul-23 02:28 PM] melon164#0000
It's extremely easy to overproduce TIO on KI-401b


[20-Jul-23 02:28 PM] melon164#0000
I think I already do so


[20-Jul-23 02:30 PM] melon164#0000
Hmm, actually I don't, I'm under if I use all my SMEs there for TI (currently a mix of TI/FE/STL)


[20-Jul-23 02:33 PM] melon164#0000
My suggestion is to have EXT and SME on KI-401b, feeding ASM and SKF on KI-401a.  Set the taxes for PIOs on KI-401a stupidly high and try and build a population that's _only_ SET/TEC/ENG, which should be a lot easier to maintain POPI wise


[20-Jul-23 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mostly make CTF in my ASMs, but I do have 96 FET and 68 AST @ 1200 right now to help with the SKFs


[20-Jul-23 06:08 PM] syqel#0000
I am slowly ramping up my TIO capacity on se-648c

could anyone provide me with these?


[21-Jul-23 03:33 PM] churavis#0000
You're going to need higher tier plates if you want to be able to get the most out of your HTE. Low tier plates will limit your maximum acceleration.


[21-Jul-23 03:35 PM] churavis#0000
Also I have a CQL in stock on ANT and BR2 that just finished on Nike and is only awaiting transportation back to ANT


[21-Jul-23 03:36 PM] churavis#0000
Also, I've got RDL, RDS, and STS if you want to trick it out a bit more


[21-Jul-23 05:04 PM] exeler#0000
Did I hear someone say they need fancy hull plates?

My HWP would be more than happy to make something other than loads and loads of those boring LHP/BHP.

[21-Jul-23 09:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
unfortunately the extra weight from the higher tier plates vastly cancels out the increased g-factor


[21-Jul-23 09:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
the increased g factor from the high-g seats (5 -> 12) means that you already hit max acceleration with the 22 factor the seats+lhp provide


[21-Jul-23 09:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
at least, that's for an LCB. A WCB looks to be best with reinforced plates. 22 factor maxes out at 215m/ss while the reinforced get you to 225 for a WCB only.


[21-Jul-23 09:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll take the STS just cause, what's the pricing on the CQL, BR2 and STS?


[21-Jul-23 09:40 PM] churavis#0000
BR2 900k
CQL 900k
STS 125k


[22-Jul-23 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000

[24-Jul-23 11:45 AM] higgsy#0000
I was planning on upgrading both of my starter ships to the following blueprint. They're currently WCB, LFL, and LHP at the moment. What do y'all think?

[24-Jul-23 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the consensus is usually that if you need to upgrade the crew quarters or you're changing the engines, you might as well just make a new ship, because you're already paying such a big portion of the cost of the ship anyway

{Reactions}
👆 (2) 

[24-Jul-23 11:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
since there's no way to "recover" the CQS, RCT, and ENG that would disappear in the upgrade


[24-Jul-23 12:53 PM] melon164#0000
The fuel benefits of FSE/QCR over ENG/RCT are minimal at best, so that's a complete waste of 1.5M per ship


[24-Jul-23 12:53 PM] melon164#0000
Personally I'm glad I went for LCB ships over WCB ships, even with the additional cost, but YMMV


[24-Jul-23 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think _more_ ships is always better than fine tuning them to something exact. You'll find a use for WCB ships.. even if LCB is better... I think it's better to have WCB + LCB than pay a fairly similar cost for just the LCB


[24-Jul-23 01:07 PM] melon164#0000
True dat


[24-Jul-23 01:07 PM] melon164#0000
Even if you're planning on running on BASIC like me, having extra ships to 'leave places' is very helpful


[24-Jul-23 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
Definitely just make new ships at that point. WCB are highly important if you ever want to get into weight based things, like minerals or metals


[24-Jul-23 03:08 PM] exeler#0000
I make heavy use of my WCB. But I also cart around lots of carbon and aluminum.


[24-Jul-23 05:24 PM] higgsy#0000
Ah, yes. That AL and C that keeps piling up in my warehouses...


[24-Jul-23 05:53 PM] higgsy#0000
What about the blueprint above for a 3rd ship?


[24-Jul-23 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, that looks good. It's almost the same as the OOG standard 2k ship,


[24-Jul-23 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just the FTL fuel tank size difference, which doesn't affect any of the other materials (bridge or crew quarters size)


[24-Jul-23 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
so go for it!


[24-Jul-23 07:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
There might be a case for adding the seats, now that they have been buffed too


[25-Jul-23 09:49 AM] hernanduer#0000

Most people just upgrade their start ships to WCB as it's much cheaper


[29-Jul-23 12:39 PM] sage42#0000
WCB? @churavis


[29-Jul-23 12:39 PM] churavis#0000
High load 3,000t/1,000m


[29-Jul-23 12:39 PM] churavis#0000
You won't need a new crew quarters for it


[29-Jul-23 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely recommend the WCB ship because you don't need the new bridge (or crew quarters..?) for it


[29-Jul-23 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
I probably shouldn't say that though since I'd be the one selling you the CQM


[29-Jul-23 12:41 PM] sage42#0000
Makes sense, the only Issue is that I need them mostly to ship water which needs equal volume


[29-Jul-23 12:41 PM] churavis#0000
Just build a new ship then

{Reactions}
this (3) 

[29-Jul-23 01:02 PM] exeler#0000
If you replace the crew quarters (and other expensive components) on the starter ships, you don't get them back. 

So it makes sense to upgrade the starters by replacing the less expensive components up until the point where you need to start swapping in the expensive ones. 

If you need a new crew quarters and such, you already have more than half the cost of a new ship covered. Might as well just tack on an engine and have a full new ship.

I'm still missing 1 ENG, 1 MFL and 1 SSL, does someone produce them / should I replace them by something someone here produces?

I've got a shiny GEN, it's so new you can still see all the way through it


[04-Aug-23 11:30 PM] sage42#0000
Is that to replace the ENG or is the game flat out messing with me?

A GEN is totally an engine

We're going to need another engine builder, preferable someone who plans on sticking around

if I do it, I basically become yuen, able to make almost an entire ship

With Liquidity, are there any recommendations for a 2k ship?


[08-Aug-23 03:45 AM] melon164#0000
If I make more HYR and less HPR, I'll have an excess of SPF time that could be put towards QCR


[08-Aug-23 03:46 AM] melon164#0000
I already have an ETC line, would just need to expand that


[08-Aug-23 08:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
g seats and faster engines, but the total ship cost is going to be at least 2x, probably closer to 3. So like 10mil for a ship


[08-Aug-23 09:54 AM] melon164#0000
Nah, 250k for AGS, an extra 1M for HPR or 1.75M for HYR, 500k extra for BR2.  50% extra cost tops


[08-Aug-23 09:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
ah don't forget the HTE


[08-Aug-23 09:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
also my AGS price is 175k!


[08-Aug-23 09:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
please buy my stuff 😄


[08-Aug-23 09:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
also you need a CQL for them instead of a CQM - that might only be like 50k difference though


[08-Aug-23 10:45 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the OOG 2k Standard is still a good ship. I can't find a pinned comment for it. It probably would be nice to have an official standard now for the "non-premium" 2k


[08-Aug-23 10:51 AM] allocater#0000
the old standard ship disappeared a bit, but it's still hidden in the default numbers

[08-Aug-23 11:41 AM] higgsy#0000
Are AHP, STS, and RDS worth it for the premium 2k ship?


[08-Aug-23 11:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
LHP are the lightest plate, you'll actually accelerate a good bit slower if you use AHP even though the AHP increases the G-factor. Maybe AHP with a tiny or small cargo bay would be worth it.


[08-Aug-23 11:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
STS are good on a ship or two just in case you wanna land on low/high gravity for some reason


[08-Aug-23 11:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
RDS/RDL, dunno if anyone here makes them so dunno pricing


[08-Aug-23 03:54 PM] churavis#0000
I make RDS and RDL and offer discounted pricing for corp members


[08-Aug-23 03:55 PM] churavis#0000
I also make STS as well


[08-Aug-23 04:07 PM] churavis#0000
Also, high tier plates are necessary of you want to get the most out of high tier engines. Low tier plates will cap your maximum  acceleration.


[09-Aug-23 06:46 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Do the specialized plates (APT, AWH, SRP) also need to be replaced during repairs like LHP & SSC? Or are they a once-off cost?


[09-Aug-23 07:57 AM] melon164#0000
AWH definitely


[09-Aug-23 07:57 AM] melon164#0000
I assume the others too


[09-Aug-23 08:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think all plates do, which makes them pretty ineffective


[09-Aug-23 08:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
they increase damage reduction, but the only cost of damage is replacing plates, but they themselves are the bulk of that cost

{Reactions}
😆 

[09-Aug-23 08:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
it just makes no sense


[09-Aug-23 08:44 AM] churavis#0000
The plates do need to be replaced during repairs, but not as much after the update. That's one of the advantages of RDL, RDS and STS, they reduce the amount of damage your ship takes without increasing the cost or complexity of repairs.


[09-Aug-23 08:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, drones are the only continuing "free" damage reduction, so depending on their cost they might make sense


[09-Aug-23 08:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
amortization and all that


[11-Aug-23 09:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
Just so you guys know, here's what some basic G seats can do on the starter WCB 🙂

[11-Aug-23 09:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
from 98.1m/ss to 134.9m/ss


[11-Aug-23 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
basically if you're capped at G10 aka 98.1 m/ss acceleration, take a look at some basic G seats. They're cheap 🙂


[11-Aug-23 09:56 AM] churavis#0000
Your two ships there aren't using the same amount of fuel so it's not really a fair comparison. They also don't have full inventories, which isn't likely in the real world


[11-Aug-23 10:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
the slower one is using more fuel


[11-Aug-23 10:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
but you're right, checking again with a full load, the behavior is different since the peak acceleration is considerably lower


[11-Aug-23 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's not really a negative to including a BGS though. As long as the weight is <400t, there seems to be an advantage to it. Just a thought at least, given the price is pretty low


[11-Aug-23 11:04 AM] exeler#0000
I mean, I end up having to fly ships empty a fair bit. Not all of my bases have a clean input/output ratio. 

My Griffonstone base in particular is bad. Lots of heavy inputs, but the outputs are all very light and small.


[11-Aug-23 04:38 PM] higgsy#0000

Looks like the ship building protocol has changed on my time away. Do we send contracts to individual producers now for the components? Also, which price do I use?

complete restructuring of a couple planets, and another couple base permits 😅


[16-Aug-23 07:26 PM] fremen45#0000
Yeah okay that makes sense but I was trying to make engines prior to working with this corp so what I was trying to see is if I already made or produced the raw product you needed for making engines yourself?


[16-Aug-23 07:28 PM] fremen45#0000

I forgot I had a CX order for the QCR and some random person filled it. I did some napkin math and decided I might as well build 2 ships since I can afford it 😅 

I put in another CX order for a QCR (as well as all the other components I need in case anyone wants to sell some ship parts). If someone fills that one too... I might build 3 ships 🤣


[22-Aug-23 03:58 PM] pateirn#0000
@churavis Thank you! last peice I need for my second starter upgrade! 🙂


[22-Aug-23 04:05 PM] churavis#0000
Starter upgrade? You could have just built a new 2k/2k for not much more. Most people who usually just give their starter ships a WCB and MFL as that doesn't require a bigger crew quarters or much else.


[22-Aug-23 04:07 PM] pateirn#0000
This was just what was recommended to me in my old corp. But new ships were basically impossible to come by


[22-Aug-23 04:10 PM] pateirn#0000
If you have suggestions, here is my current on-hand parts list. 1 LCB 2 LFE 96 LHP 1 MFL 1 MSL and then the CQM


[22-Aug-23 04:13 PM] churavis#0000
You're going to need WCB eventually anyways and it's so much cheaper if an upgrade than LCB. I recommend you get a loan from the bank and just build a new ship

[22-Aug-23 04:14 PM] churavis#0000
You're in a new corp that has a bank and ship builders now, you should take advantage of that


[22-Aug-23 04:15 PM] pateirn#0000
Absolutely. I want to be efficient for sure. New ship is 4.685 mil?  I have about 2.4 atm. The bank can cover that gap?


[22-Aug-23 04:22 PM] churavis#0000
You've already got many of the parts you'd need for a new ship ship I'm sure the rest would be much less. You could also upgrade your starter ships to WCB and have plenty more shipping capacity than you do now.


[22-Aug-23 04:23 PM] pateirn#0000
Okay, awesome. Makes perfect sense. New ship sounds way cooler. lol


[22-Aug-23 04:28 PM] pateirn#0000
Alright. I think this is my order list. 

1 SFE
1 FSE
1 QCR
1 BR1
1 FFC


[22-Aug-23 04:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
AGS are for T2 engines only, really. It's a waste for a regular ship


[22-Aug-23 04:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
however if you want a BGS, I have 1 in stock


[22-Aug-23 04:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
not sure how useful it'd be though, best to check in the planner


[22-Aug-23 04:31 PM] pateirn#0000
Yes please. I have 0 idea what I am doing, just following the spreadsheet lol


[22-Aug-23 04:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
ahhhh okay, then you probably don't want one at all 🙂


[22-Aug-23 04:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
follow the 1's on the far left for what you need


[22-Aug-23 04:33 PM] pateirn#0000
Yep, I see. I didn't see numbers, that why I them both down lol


[22-Aug-23 04:42 PM] churavis#0000
I have a BR1 in production, it will be done on Nike in a day or two days if you want it on ANT

This is HTE/HYR/LCB/AGS, a 2k Clipper with AGS - LHP vs AHP


[25-Aug-23 03:53 PM] higgsy#0000
They're both using about 7k AIC fuel to get to Etherwind in 23 hours. LHP gets 60% more damage.


[25-Aug-23 03:54 PM] higgsy#0000
Here's max fuel:

[25-Aug-23 03:54 PM] higgsy#0000
At which point, LHP and AHP are the same time except LHP uses 85% more fuel.


[25-Aug-23 03:57 PM] higgsy#0000
If you're willing to plop down 21k AIC to get to Etherwind in 10 hours.


[25-Aug-23 04:00 PM] exeler#0000
LHP is on the left?

It looks like LHP is better than AHP at max speed. Less fuel, shorter time. But more damage.


[25-Aug-23 04:01 PM] higgsy#0000
Yes, LHP on the left. But it's only 6 minutes better and 10k AIC more fuel.


[25-Aug-23 04:03 PM] higgsy#0000
And I'm sure that the LHP's 60% damage increase and 50% extra fuel at max speed will be sure to bite you in the butt


[25-Aug-23 04:13 PM] churavis#0000
Ships are not very well balanced. The more expensive plates should be lighter not heavier

[25-Aug-23 04:34 PM] higgsy#0000
So I like shortening the ship names:


[25-Aug-23 04:37 PM] higgsy#0000
*Puddlejumper
*3k/1k Hauler
*1k/3k Tanker
*2k/2k Carrier
*2k/2k Clipper
*Racing Yacht


[25-Aug-23 04:39 PM] churavis#0000
We want short names so it either needs to be just Yacht or just Racer


[25-Aug-23 04:39 PM] churavis#0000
It's going to get shortened eventually anyways


[25-Aug-23 05:38 PM] fremen45#0000
I think Clipper includes all ships running higher tier engines from my understanding. So if you have a hyper-thrust engine on a 3K/1K ship then it would be a clipper assuming it has an FTL.


[25-Aug-23 05:40 PM] churavis#0000
That was what I was thinking


[25-Aug-23 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
which hardly matters when AHP cost 500% more than LHP


[25-Aug-23 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
also not seeing the fuel use,  the LHP is using 5% less fuel


[25-Aug-23 07:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
which makes sense, since it is lighter


[26-Aug-23 07:53 AM] higgsy#0000
Oh, dun goof number reading


[26-Aug-23 07:57 AM] higgsy#0000
What about "Standard" Carrier/Hauler/Tanker and "Premium" Carrier/Hauler/Tanker?


[26-Aug-23 07:58 AM] higgsy#0000
Keep it simple and familiar


[26-Aug-23 10:19 AM] churavis#0000
We want it short

[28-Aug-23 07:42 AM] churavis#0000
Hey, I'm the one that makes BR2


[28-Aug-23 07:46 AM] churavis#0000
There's barely enough demand in the corp and on the market for the few that I make


[28-Aug-23 07:46 AM] melon164#0000
I'm hoping to stimulate the market for engines with plentiful BR2s 🤷‍♂️


[28-Aug-23 07:48 AM] churavis#0000
You're going to oversaturate the market really quick


[28-Aug-23 07:49 AM] melon164#0000
That's kind of the idea, I'll probably make 20-30 and then pull the UPFs down and get my spare permit back


[28-Aug-23 07:49 AM] churavis#0000
That's called dumping


[28-Aug-23 07:50 AM] melon164#0000
Only if I crash the price, surely?


[28-Aug-23 07:50 AM] melon164#0000
Which I don't intend to


[28-Aug-23 07:51 AM] melon164#0000
atm it feels like everyone is saying "oh noes there's a universe-wide shortage of BR2" at the same time that people are saying "there's no point me making BR2 because there's no market"


[28-Aug-23 07:51 AM] churavis#0000
Well yes, that's how I keep CX prices high, by being the only one on the market


[28-Aug-23 07:55 AM] churavis#0000
Also, I thought we had a shortage of engine producers in the corp and on the market


[28-Aug-23 07:59 AM] melon164#0000
We have a surplus of FSE, shortage of ENG, no-one-wants AEN, 'shortage' (in the sense that it takes a month to make and there's one in the queue) of HTE; then a shortage of QCR, surplus of RCT, stupid surplus of HPR, no-one-wants HYR


[28-Aug-23 08:01 AM] melon164#0000
I have a production line that's ratioed for HPR/HYR, where I have 10M of spare FIR, idle ECAs making capacitors for the MM gods, while I can't shovel tungsten through for ATP/HNZ fast enough 🤷‍♂️


[28-Aug-23 08:01 AM] churavis#0000
So, why not just focus on what's in demand?


[28-Aug-23 08:02 AM] churavis#0000
Also, your idle ECA's could always make POW for Phobos upkeep


[28-Aug-23 08:06 AM] melon164#0000
> So, why not just focus on what's in demand? 
Because that would mean admitting a strategic error and the true capitalist always prefers to just throw more capital into the problem 😉


[28-Aug-23 08:07 AM] melon164#0000
> Also, your idle ECA's could always make POW for Phobos upkeep
That I can certainly do; I have way more LI than BE right now


[28-Aug-23 09:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I built up a several month stock of LFEs and it worked pretty well. We can coordinate in the corp to fix prices. Alternate posting small amounts  at the same price and the cx will alternate which one gets filled if that’s a concern


[28-Aug-23 09:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
It would be nice to have a handful of each ship component on the cx at any time and that’s definitely not the case atm


[28-Aug-23 09:21 AM] churavis#0000
We also need to export BR2 to all the other major CX as well or we'll have traders buying on ANT just to repost higher elsewhere


[28-Aug-23 09:23 AM] melon164#0000
True, which is a PITA because they're 400m3 each 😠


[28-Aug-23 09:24 AM] churavis#0000
I actually was planning on expanding my UPF production so I could build enough BR2 and other UPF products to bring CX prices down in a sustainable way, it's just hard building out the production lines to be able to feed them


[28-Aug-23 09:29 AM] melon164#0000
yeah I have nowhere near the PPF capacity to keep all those going, it's very much a go-quick-then-go-home exercise


[28-Aug-23 10:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
I believe I have a fair bit of PSL/PSM/PSS I can spare in a one-off sale

But it's something you already produce, on the planet where you already produce it, so it's obviously too easy to merit more than 1 faction reputation point.

I generally try to do them, just to keep on the leaderboard. It's usually a loss. But if you're doing it for rep, at least I try to get 2. Most of the time it's shipping from Nike to ANT so it's pretty easy.


[29-Aug-23 05:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've done like 3 "exploration missions" but those feel like the biggest waste to me


[29-Aug-23 05:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Getting to top rating does require some luck, mostly getting the 50 point contracts

Yeah, I've considered it, but usually I can avoid missions that don't go to my regular worlds


[29-Aug-23 06:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have also considered building a bunch of puddlejumpers just to pump up my ship count in the leaderboard 😄


[29-Aug-23 06:18 PM] exeler#0000
Could start a campaign where just buy everything off the other exchanges and move it to the ANT exchange. 

Bonus points if you can list it above MM prices just to flex.

Big LHP auction up for 1400/u if anyone's looking to build or repair a ship.

[03-Sep-23 09:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
most of the stuff is available on ANT a few days after it's made, so that's typically a safe bet


[03-Sep-23 09:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you send blind contracts though, you're gonna need a lot of lead time, or they'll be rejected. Better to ask first when the part will be available


[03-Sep-23 09:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
for my stuff, I need about a week


[03-Sep-23 09:22 AM] tuffyless#0000
Okty , can i put an order into you for 1 MFL, 1 MSL, 1 LCB?


[03-Sep-23 09:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
sure, just send the contracts

I've got them in stock on ANT, send contracts


[03-Sep-23 09:50 AM] melon164#0000
ENG 700k, in stock; RCT 700k, 4-5d

thanks guys ... contds sent


[03-Sep-23 01:03 PM] allocater#0000
LFE MFE SFE are all cheaper hanging on the CX ready to buy, FFC you can send a contract or put an offer on CX so will fulfill it


[04-Sep-23 01:44 AM] dehzhas#0000
I need:

* 4x BR1
* 4x CQM
* ~~4x FFC~~
* ~~4x FSE~~
* 4x LCB
* ~~8x LFE~~
* 364x LHP
* ~~4x MFE~~
* 4x MFL
* 4x QCR
* ~~8x SFE~~
* ~~488x SSC~~
* ~~4x SSL~~

I know this will take a bit to get all that, but I'm ramping up my fleet 🙂

I have posted orders on the CX at corp prices for all of those except MFE, MFL and LCB. I'll send those contracts direct depending on who can supply them.


[04-Sep-23 01:57 AM] melon164#0000
I put two of the FFC in


[04-Sep-23 01:57 AM] melon164#0000

[05-Sep-23 09:34 AM] melon164#0000
Thinking of pulling down my SPP, I just can't keep it busy.  Does anyone want anything from that line before I do?


[05-Sep-23 09:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have one I leave idle a large amount of the time, so no worries if you tear it down


[05-Sep-23 10:22 AM] churavis#0000
I need BPT


[05-Sep-23 10:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
how many? I have a good amount of extra THF right now


[05-Sep-23 11:07 AM] churavis#0000
Give me one batch of 10


[05-Sep-23 11:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
do you have the THP?


[05-Sep-23 11:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
or I can make some, just still spinning up parts


[05-Sep-23 11:08 AM] churavis#0000
I have plenty on Nike


[05-Sep-23 11:17 AM] churavis#0000
If it was me that had the SPP, I would build up a stockpile of all the parts, list them on all the major CX, then tear the building down until I run out of something. It will lock up capital for a while but that's better than having it idle.


[05-Sep-23 11:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, it's just even getting the parts to make stuff takes a while


[05-Sep-23 11:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
if I could build a supply, that's a good plan


[05-Sep-23 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have one WPL just making KV and TK for BGS and AGS and that takes forever


[05-Sep-23 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
WPL are just so big and I already have like 15 in my empire


[05-Sep-23 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
I just don't have space to make more, and that's just those parts


[05-Sep-23 11:28 AM] melon164#0000
I had a decent run making AGS with a stockpile of ~100 TK I built up


[05-Sep-23 11:28 AM] melon164#0000
but yeah, they're almost impossible to maintain the supply chain for long-term


[05-Sep-23 11:29 AM] churavis#0000
What did you do with that AGS?


[05-Sep-23 11:29 AM] melon164#0000
sold them all


[05-Sep-23 11:29 AM] melon164#0000
nearly


[05-Sep-23 11:30 AM] melon164#0000
looks like I've got one left


[05-Sep-23 11:30 AM] melon164#0000
plus one cooking


[05-Sep-23 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
and I'm making one atm too


[07-Sep-23 10:06 PM] exeler#0000
Do you still need the LHP? I just noticed I've got enough sitting on ANT now


[08-Sep-23 03:12 AM] mrsmith33#0000
How does ship upgrading work? Do you get back the old part?


[08-Sep-23 03:14 AM] exeler#0000
Nope. So it makes sense to only swap in parts that don't require you to swap out an expensive component. If you're replacing the bridges or crew quarters for example, you might as well buy a new ship outright and add to your fleet instead.


[08-Sep-23 03:15 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Does it makes sense to upgrade to 1000/1000 from starter?


[08-Sep-23 03:15 AM] exeler#0000
I think most people jumped to 1k/3k since it's basically just getting the cargo bay and some extra plates


[08-Sep-23 03:20 AM] exeler#0000
This is what I ended up doing for both of my starters. Even if you're not hauling heavy things, it's a 2x increase. If you are doing heavy things, it's a 6x increase. And I ship a lot of heavy things so it held me over for a long while.

You mean 3k/1k?


[08-Sep-23 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely WCB, 3k/1k- the VCB will bump up the crew quarters and bridge and that's bad


[08-Sep-23 02:30 PM] churavis#0000
You mean hauler


[08-Sep-23 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000

[08-Sep-23 05:20 PM] higgsy#0000
tldr: Excluding damange costs, the cheapest fuel costs for a Tier 4 Carrier is using LHP and AGS.


[08-Sep-23 05:21 PM] higgsy#0000
Increase FF for extra speed instead of FF


[08-Sep-23 05:24 PM] higgsy#0000
What's missing from the chart above is that I deleted rows where the fuel costs would be the same, but the SF and FF values were flipped. So 400 SF/ 200 FF costs the same as 200 SF / 400 FF, but the higher SF combo flew LHP/AGS at 23:05 instead of 20:46 for higher FF.


[08-Sep-23 05:52 PM] dehzhas#0000
I could use a few hundred!


[08-Sep-23 06:04 PM] exeler#0000

How expensive it is to upgrade starter ship to 3kt one?


[13-Sep-23 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
take a look at the sheet in the pinned


[13-Sep-23 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's also the pinned comment on what is required for a ship upgrade


[13-Sep-23 09:00 AM] mrsmith33#0000
```
18 BHP = 18x1800 =  32400
25 SSC = 25x300  =   7500
WCB              = 325000
LFE              = 200000
Total            = 564900
```


[13-Sep-23 09:09 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Does upgrade take any time?


[13-Sep-23 09:13 AM] hernanduer#0000

[13-Sep-23 09:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
typically it's best to coordinate here and then to send a contract, I don't like buy ads because the timing on them are too tight


[13-Sep-23 09:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
and the list of people who can fulfill it is there in the sheet 🙂


[13-Sep-23 09:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
I can do one WCB in 3 days on Deimos, or 5 on ANT. And the second will be 10 days from now, or 12 to ANT


[13-Sep-23 09:58 AM] mrsmith33#0000
ok, I will wait


[13-Sep-23 10:13 AM] hernanduer#0000

Anyone selling BHP on Deimos?


[14-Sep-23 05:37 PM] higgsy#0000
I'd recommend upgrading to LHP.


[14-Sep-23 08:38 PM] exeler#0000
I've got both, I move them to ANT regularly though, but for smaller orders I've got a good chance of having them waiting to ship.


[15-Sep-23 04:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
How does the hauler build look like with BHPs when upgrading from starter?


[15-Sep-23 07:51 AM] churavis#0000
Personally, I never changed my starter ships from BHP


[15-Sep-23 07:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Does LHP reduce fuel usage?


[15-Sep-23 07:58 AM] churavis#0000
It slightly reduces SF fuel usage but also increases damage taken


[15-Sep-23 08:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
But they're also cheaper. And ever so slightly faster


[15-Sep-23 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
Well LHP is cheaper than BHP but you'll have to repair slightly more often, so it probably equals out


[15-Sep-23 08:49 AM] churavis#0000
They're not cheap enough to make up for the cost of upgrading in any reasonable time frame


[15-Sep-23 10:09 AM] higgsy#0000
They're faster


[15-Sep-23 10:10 AM] mrsmith33#0000
faster == less fuel

Not sure if @dehzhas is done with his building spree?


[15-Sep-23 06:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
I still need one more (after the one I forgot to send you the contract for until now). The logistics pressure is lower, so I can get behind people if needed.


[15-Sep-23 06:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
I may have an extra MSL … I bought too many of a few things. Will check shortly.


[15-Sep-23 09:09 PM] dehzhas#0000
@higgsy I have an MSL at corp pricing available on Heph at the moment. I can ship it back to ANT within a day or so if you prefer.

[16-Sep-23 08:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
@mrsmith33 I had the WCB finished for the last day, but forgot the contract was on deimos so I shipped it to ant. It'll be an hour past contract expire before it gets back to Deimos 😴


[16-Sep-23 08:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
no problem, will there be a button to extend contract?

Yeah


[16-Sep-23 08:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
Also @parisinspringtime you're gonna have to join the AST line to get an LCB. I never received that order from earlier, so there's just one WCB in front of you. Maybe a week before I can make the LCB

Anyone want to join me on KI-401b?


[16-Sep-23 09:38 AM] melon164#0000
Would be good to push that planet to metallurgy, IMO


[16-Sep-23 09:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have it balanced for RE atm, but I can look at rebalancing it to Metal. Just requires a slight rebuild.


[16-Sep-23 09:51 AM] melon164#0000
I think it's more productive overall with metallurgy


[16-Sep-23 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm just running SMEs and EXTs, so as long as I change the BUI ratio from 6:11 to 7:10 beforehand, I'm fine with swapping to Metallurgy


[16-Sep-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
the impact is very minimal it seems, at the PIO level like that


[16-Sep-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
but if it helps your ASM then okay 🙂

See pinned FTL spreadsheet.  
Shows the prices itemized for a typical boat.


[19-Sep-23 01:54 AM] allocater#0000
for a second base, the 2 starter ships should still be enough


[19-Sep-23 01:55 AM] allocater#0000
first comes the upgrade of the 2 starter ships at base ...4 ? the third ship comes after base .. 6?

QCR in stock; ENG 3-4d


[22-Sep-23 07:05 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Sent you a contract for the QCR


[24-Sep-23 09:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
Current (or soon) stock:
1 QCR
1 FSE
2 LCB
3 MFL
2 FFC
1 BGS
300 LHP
200 SSC


[24-Sep-23 09:23 AM] churavis#0000
Does BGS help with QCR?


[24-Sep-23 09:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's for the sublight travel, I'm actually not sure. With an FSE it doesn't seem useful in a full size ship. You need to get to the capped acceleration of 98.1 with LHP for it to be useful. You can do that with an FSE and MCB or smaller, at which point a BGS makes sense


[24-Sep-23 09:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
That's after I fiddled with the BLU just now


[24-Sep-23 09:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
And even then, the acceleration scales down with mass of the ship. So the BGS only gives any use when the ship is very near empty


[24-Sep-23 09:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
But I'd say T2 engines, it's a waste of the engine if you don't at least have a BGS

How would I build a Racer to deliver supplies?


[26-Sep-23 12:45 PM] churavis#0000
Depends on your strategy. Mine is to deliver most supplies with regular visits, which is easy since I rely on a hub and spoke model where almost all trips start or end with ANT, my hub. I have a lux racer that I only use for emergencies when it's super fast engines are worth guzzling oceans of fuel in order to save production from stopping.


[26-Sep-23 12:47 PM] higgsy#0000
Ok, I'm looking for a Lux Racer for when supplies are gone


[26-Sep-23 01:00 PM] melon164#0000

[05-Oct-23 03:40 PM] melon164#0000
I think I have some on CX?  If so you should take that before bringing more into the world.  Can’t remember what price I set but can go cheaper

I need 

1 CQS 
1 ENG
1 RCT


[12-Oct-23 07:50 AM] melon164#0000
Why RCT rather than QCR?


[12-Oct-23 08:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
they're faster


[12-Oct-23 08:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
20% faster, but slower charge time. If it's more than about 3 parsecs in distance, it's faster


[12-Oct-23 08:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
also you have to use max FF fuel (though I do that quite often, since unlike SF, it scales linearly)


[12-Oct-23 08:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
all that is to say, I can have an RCT on Heph in about 3 days


[12-Oct-23 08:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
well 5 days, with an ENG available in 2 days

I mainly make FTL engines, so no competition from me for FSE


[12-Oct-23 03:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, the complexity seems to take an extra step with the sublights :/


[12-Oct-23 03:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
kinda fun but impossible to balance reasonably, I have millions in idle middle-parts


[13-Oct-23 09:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
ENG is available on ANT


[19-Oct-23 10:07 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Seems like Fuel-saving STL Engine is strictly better, as it consumes less and takes less time on the same flight test. Is this right?


[19-Oct-23 10:22 AM] melon164#0000
In my experience, yes


[19-Oct-23 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's less powerful, so at max fuel it won't be faster then an ENG


[19-Oct-23 11:06 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm usually on minimal fuel consumtion


[19-Oct-23 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's a linear fuel to power usage though, but sublight physics are non-linear, so you get diminishing returns


[19-Oct-23 11:06 AM] melon164#0000
At max fuel, the only thing that's moving fast is your bank balance


[19-Oct-23 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
Lol ya for sublight absolutely


[19-Oct-23 11:07 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What reactor is better?


[19-Oct-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
Do you use max or min FF fuel?


[19-Oct-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
Min is qcr, max is rct


[19-Oct-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
The advantage of RCT only comes after a certain amount of FF fuel use


[19-Oct-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
80% I think, since 2000/2400


[19-Oct-23 11:11 AM] hernanduer#0000
At max FF, I think we found a 2.4ps long jump was faster and with equal fuel as the QCR. As you get longer, the RCT gets even better


[19-Oct-23 11:11 AM] hernanduer#0000
If you're at min or even half fuel though, they both fly the same speed, so the shorter charge time of the QCR will always make it faster


[19-Oct-23 11:12 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I see. QCR it is then


[19-Oct-23 11:12 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Why am I getting invalid status in blueprint tester some times?

[19-Oct-23 11:26 AM] churavis#0000
I have STS if you plan on visiting lots of low or high gravity planets


[19-Oct-23 11:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I need even smaller fuel tanks 😆


[19-Oct-23 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd recommend at least LFL and MSL


[19-Oct-23 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's hard to make it to Demeter and back with even an MFL


[19-Oct-23 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
(in a timely manner)


[19-Oct-23 11:46 AM] mrsmith33#0000
My biggest route atm is ANT -> Nascent -> Elon -> ANT atm. Which takes ~600 SF / 48h total


[19-Oct-23 11:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
SF is fine to go smaller, it's the FF tanks that I'd recommend bigger


[19-Oct-23 11:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
yeah, those look pretty lightweight


[19-Oct-23 11:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
Anyway, I can provide everything except the bridge, crew quarters, and field emitters. Just send me contracts on Ant for what you need. All prices are in the sheet


[19-Oct-23 11:53 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm looking at producing some of the parts myself


[19-Oct-23 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000

Well whatever you're not wanting to make

[19-Oct-23 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
Generally there's not a lot of volume on these things, so be careful expecting things to pay off immediately, hahaha

You can use mine for free 🙂


[19-Oct-23 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
Margins on mine are basically rented, haha. 1400x200 AST leaves only 45k to pay for SKF (which idles a lot) and MFK


[19-Oct-23 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
I make it up when I finally sell something on market


[19-Oct-23 11:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
my own AST/FET is 800$/u


[19-Oct-23 12:03 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Should be ~720$/u if I do my own TIO mining


[19-Oct-23 12:05 PM] mrsmith33#0000
So cargo bay is 150-160k/u if I use my own materials


[19-Oct-23 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, but I buy it at that price I said

I can do straight swap of 200 AST + 20 MFK for 1 LCB (or whatever) at KI-401a any time

401a, so far away


[19-Oct-23 01:00 PM] mrsmith33#0000
401b is where TI is


[19-Oct-23 01:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
But you need the ASMs


[19-Oct-23 02:52 PM] melon164#0000
On 401a 😝


[19-Oct-23 02:53 PM] mrsmith33#0000
What if 401b is pure mining and you have a couple SME planets in the system (including 401a)?


[19-Oct-23 02:54 PM] mrsmith33#0000
you need 2+ SME planets, or exactly 2 + extra capacity can be used to mine ZIR


[19-Oct-23 04:10 PM] melon164#0000
I would love to flip KI-401b to metallurgy


[19-Oct-23 04:11 PM] mrsmith33#0000
RE seems good to me


[19-Oct-23 04:14 PM] melon164#0000
It’s OP for the amount of smelting you can reasonably get in nearby


[19-Oct-23 04:14 PM] melon164#0000
There aren’t that many decent planets


[19-Oct-23 04:15 PM] mrsmith33#0000
My plan involves not caring about decency of planets (though POPI kinda important)


[19-Oct-23 04:16 PM] mrsmith33#0000
KI-401c is pretty dope


[19-Oct-23 04:16 PM] mrsmith33#0000
so, you can mine TIO on `b`, and smelt it on `a` and `c`


[19-Oct-23 04:22 PM] mrsmith33#0000
171.2 TI/day + some spare ZIR/FEO/LIO


[19-Oct-23 04:26 PM] mrsmith33#0000
`b`

but what're you gonna do with all that TI?


[19-Oct-23 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll need 2 planets all with ASMs


[19-Oct-23 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
then all it really makes is SKF products, which, while they have nice margins, are gonna be super easily saturated in the market


[19-Oct-23 06:18 PM] draconisdomini#0000
@hernanduer Do you have an FSE and a QCR I can purchase?


[19-Oct-23 06:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have an FSE available on Heph, and a QCR in a couple days


[19-Oct-23 06:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Would it be possible to pick them both up from ANT when the QCR is done?


[19-Oct-23 06:20 PM] hernanduer#0000

😠 why does everyone suddenly want RCT rather than QCR?


[20-Oct-23 02:54 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
going for the cheaper option here (afaik). 😅


[20-Oct-23 02:54 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
my next ship might have a QCR.


[20-Oct-23 03:03 PM] melon164#0000
Umm, pretty sure they’re the same price


[20-Oct-23 03:03 PM] melon164#0000
They should be, anyway


[20-Oct-23 03:04 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i see. thanks.
the more reason to use them in my next build.


[21-Oct-23 08:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
Do you want to make that one? I can cover it once this QCR is done


[21-Oct-23 05:32 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
Hi everybody, is there any chance to build a FTL ship without subscription?


[21-Oct-23 05:47 PM] churavis#0000
No, you can only upgrade and build ships without pro. Even with basic, you cannot upgrade or build new ships but you do keep whatever upgrades or ships you made when you had pro, except that you can only have 2 ships traveling at one time.


[21-Oct-23 05:48 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
All right  thanks

[24-Oct-23 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
also double check your build, you probably want LHP and FSE at least

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[24-Oct-23 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
also also, you only want a 300 FF capacity? it doesn't go far and typically an MFL doesn't meaningfully increase the cost of the ship


[24-Oct-23 03:18 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
cool, I edited it


[24-Oct-23 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you are doing an upgrade, you don't need all those parts


[24-Oct-23 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
You only need the "new" parts


[24-Oct-23 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
the difference between the original and the upgraded parts


[25-Oct-23 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah I totally missed that word, just assumed it was a new build


[25-Oct-23 09:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
The upgrade should be: 1xWCB,  1xLFE, 25xSSC,  16xBHP


[25-Oct-23 12:18 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
I finally have all parts together. It was a hard birth 😅  haha thanks to all supporters !

Yep:

In stock on ANT:
62 LFE @ 200k
20 MFE @ 80k
50 SFE @ 50k
8 FFC @ 350k

send contracts anytime 🙂


[26-Oct-23 05:23 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Is there a usecase for other hull plate types?


[26-Oct-23 05:24 PM] churavis#0000
Higher tier engines need higher tier hull plates to reach maximum acceleration


[26-Oct-23 05:24 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I see


[26-Oct-23 05:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
only if you use smaller bays though, with the exception of VCB I think ... I made some post some months back


[26-Oct-23 05:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
because the higher tech plates are heavier, they actually reduce the max acceleration


[26-Oct-23 05:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
it only matters if you're far enough beyond the 22 Gs you can get with LHP


[26-Oct-23 06:04 PM] exeler#0000
Also, higher tier plates are a bit easier to keep up with from an SME perspective. They cook longer in the HWP. 

LHP and BHP chew through AL like crazy. Whenever I run a batch of RHP or AHP I end up with a mountain of AL I ship off to Nike.

So I tend to use RHP for my own ships since it's easier on my logistics to make RHP. 

If more people bought RHP or AHP, I'd start switching my SME out for more HWP and ASM.


[31-Oct-23 08:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
I do have an HTE available if anyone ever aspires to be Sonic


[31-Oct-23 08:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's fresh! never flown


[31-Oct-23 08:58 AM] melon164#0000
So do I 😝


[31-Oct-23 08:58 AM] melon164#0000
And twelve QCR 😕


[31-Oct-23 09:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
just wire them all together to make a super-jumper


[31-Oct-23 12:10 PM] exeler#0000
I might build a new ship soon just for the heck of it. I'll buy some QCR off ya 🙂

My shipping has been super chaotic my entire time in the game so far. No planning, just pick which good has the lowest days remaining, put that on a ship and send it to the base that needs it.

I'm probably gonna redo my screens soon to contain my different "loops" and dedicate a ship or two to running those loops.


[31-Oct-23 12:11 PM] exeler#0000
I've got like 6mil worth of plates on the CX too. If nobody's buying I'll just make them into my own ships lol


[31-Oct-23 12:58 PM] mrsmith33#0000
It takes me 1 day 8h to get to Demeter with small FF tank. Looks like I need to up it


[01-Nov-23 02:47 AM] melon164#0000

Thank you mate : 3


[12-Nov-23 04:19 PM] higgsy#0000
What does Max G-Factor, Acceleration, and FTL speed do?


[12-Nov-23 04:19 PM] higgsy#0000
And operating empty mass and Volune?


[12-Nov-23 04:53 PM] churavis#0000
Max G-Factor is how fast the ship can go sublight, Acceleration is how quick it can hit that speed and FTL is how fast interstellar jumps take


[12-Nov-23 10:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
Not quite, max g factor is the max possible acceleration of the build given the parts, while acceleration is what it will actually be. If the acceleration is hitting the g factor limit, you can check by g factor *9.8=accel listed. If it matches, then you benefit from increasing the g factor. If the acceleration is less then G\*9.8, then increasing g factor does nothing


[12-Nov-23 10:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
Empty mass is the primary impactor of sublight acceleration, while volume is for ftl


[12-Nov-23 10:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
So the acceleration listed in the buffer is based on empty mass, but of course we put stuff in our ships. This extra mass will reduce the acceleration.


[13-Nov-23 09:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
@churavis I'm doing a hybrid, it's probably what I'll do from now on. FSE + HYR. The STL fuel usage is ridiculous for the T2 engines and it's basically never worth it given how sublight scales on a power curve


[13-Nov-23 09:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
besides the extra mass/vol, T2 FTL engines scale linearly with the T1 counterparts, except they charge faster too


[13-Nov-23 09:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
so not super fancy, just what I think will be a new regular 😄


[13-Nov-23 09:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
no STS for this one though, I have one on my super ship that I don't use as is


[13-Nov-23 09:26 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Does HYR have the same fuel efficiency as regular FTL engine?


[13-Nov-23 09:26 AM] churavis#0000
STS adds no extra mass or volume, nor complexity nor cost to repairs. The only downside to it is the initial cost, but even that is lessened with the corp discount I give you


[13-Nov-23 09:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
FF use scales linearly becuase there is no "acceleration" above light speed - so yeah, they have the same eff.


[13-Nov-23 09:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'll add one later if I ever use the one on the ship I already have, don't worry 😄


[13-Nov-23 09:27 AM] mrsmith33#0000
So all FTL engines have the same convertion ratio from fuel to time?


[13-Nov-23 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
basically, yeah, but the max limit on the T2 is much higher


[13-Nov-23 09:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Cool


[13-Nov-23 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm bound by FTL tank size, annoyingly


[13-Nov-23 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
you'd have to carry in the cargo bay to go faster


[13-Nov-23 09:29 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Atm I'm limited by my ships when going to Demeter, as I have smallest FTL tank and standard engine. Takes 24 hours one way


[13-Nov-23 09:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah travel to Demeter is good reason to replace SFL with MFLs


[13-Nov-23 09:31 AM] mrsmith33#0000
MFL is less than 100k on CX. Lower than corp prices


[13-Nov-23 09:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah... just buy there


[13-Nov-23 09:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
he's discounting ZR by too much


[13-Nov-23 09:33 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Are you buying ZR on CX?


[13-Nov-23 09:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
no


[14-Nov-23 04:27 AM] martin1194#0000
what price is it? or u send me contract when it's up?


[14-Nov-23 04:44 AM] melon164#0000
your original order (200k) is plenty, send me a CONTD 🙂


[14-Nov-23 04:58 AM] martin1194#0000
ok. cuz I didn't check the price just care is too low and wanna buy it faster. XDD

I can do the FSE - melon might already have a HYR but I can get one by this weekend


[13-Dec-23 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
also of course send me LCB, LFL, AGS


[13-Dec-23 11:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh and the MSL


[13-Dec-23 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Melon has the HYRs on the CX for 1.4m


[13-Dec-23 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send the SFE and LFEs, and the FFC.


[13-Dec-23 11:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I bought HYR for 2M 😢


[13-Dec-23 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
hmm cost for it is about a million, so 1.4mil is only 40% profit on the chain


[13-Dec-23 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
and that's an expensive chain, mind you


[13-Dec-23 11:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
1.3mil probably makes sense for corp sales


[13-Dec-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
but as an example, an even more complicated chain for FSE comes to a cost of about 350k, and we sell those for 650k. But that chain is probably 2x as long and just as expensive to maintain


[13-Dec-23 12:07 PM] melon164#0000
I would do HYR at 1.25M corp price 😂


[13-Dec-23 12:08 PM] melon164#0000
Wait, you paid me that much?


[13-Dec-23 12:08 PM] mrsmith33#0000

Very nice. I'm making my first upgrades to WCB right now.

It will be shipping O from SE-648c (soon to be built)


[15-Dec-23 04:33 AM] cleavingambiguity#0000
O seems to be in short supply in Antares.


[15-Dec-23 09:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
Are you ordering the parts here? Generally we are going to be much cheaper than outside


[15-Dec-23 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Feel free to send those contracts if you haven’t already. Lots of us making ships suddenly


[15-Dec-23 10:56 AM] cleavingambiguity#0000
Thank you both; I appreciate it. I'll be sure to order from the corp the next time I build or upgrade. For this first one I was able to take advantage of someone offering the first five players to call dibs on a WCB.


[15-Dec-23 12:02 PM] exeler#0000
If you need plates definitely hit me up. I can make plates of any tier and have mountains of most of them sitting on ANT. 

I think half my company's net worth is in stashed hull plates at this point.

There's no free coffee on the ship, so they are happy to move in once the habs are built!


[20-Dec-23 10:37 AM] tuffyless#0000
Is it unwise to use LHP's on a boat with tier 3 (AEN / HPR) or tier 4 (HTE / HYR) engines?


[20-Dec-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
nah def use LHP


[20-Dec-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
repairs are only ever LHP and SSC


[20-Dec-23 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
and the "higher tier" plates actually reduce your speed in most cases because they are simultaneously heavier than LHP/BHP

{Reactions}
👆 

[20-Dec-23 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
while also being massively more expensive to make


[20-Dec-23 11:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
and with an AGS, you'll hit max G factor in 95% of cases - only time you might consider higher tier plates for that G factor is with T2 ship parts and MCB or smaller cargo bays


[20-Dec-23 11:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
even then, I did the math, I think just RHP work? The highest tier ones are still negative


[20-Dec-23 07:08 PM] exeler#0000
RHP are also the most convenient to make for HWP shipping (at least for me). LHP and BHP gobble AL like no tomorrow. RHP slows down the HWP significantly and makes shipping AL production way, way more manageable. 

Basically, buy some RHP. I have tons of it just from sneaking in orders to build up AL when I need to restock my Nike base.


[20-Dec-23 07:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
Think I've landed on LHP and tier 2:  FSE/QCR engines for my next LCB ship.  
Hoping to have the cash to make 2 before 2024.

If you're low on AL, you could prolly buy AL from me at corp price, make the LHP, then sell it back to me.?.


[20-Dec-23 07:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
.
I spent better part of the day looking at numbers, reading historical notes here in discord, and running simulations with various combos.  

From what I understand, is an AGS wont be needed because the acceleration metric (89.1m/s) is less than the G-factor (10*9.8) of 98.0.

What I find confusing is the FTL speed (max) for HYR says 5.1 persec/h, however; in the simul's the travel times werent much different than QCR at 2.2 parsec/h.  Something there just doesnt seem right but it's prolly me or my test's that are flawed.


[20-Dec-23 09:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Charge time is a big factor in FTL's total travel time


[20-Dec-23 11:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ah those are T1s, T2 would be like HTE and HYR. Higher tier FTL drives only go faster at higher fuel usages; basically they have a much higher top end speed. So if you minimize fuel use all the time then you should never get T2s


[20-Dec-23 11:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
And your understanding of G factor is correct


[20-Dec-23 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I recommend using as much FF as you feel like to meet schedule timetables though. It scales nearly linearly with speed, unlike SF which is logarithmic


[21-Dec-23 01:16 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is it a good idea to try to make sf/ff consumption equal, or some other algorithm should be used to find optimal fuel use for given travel time?


[21-Dec-23 06:07 AM] melon164#0000
There’s a sweet spot of diminishing returns on SF, find it and always use that, then use FF to go faster


[21-Dec-23 08:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
I go the other way, I keep SF at 3/4 steps from the minimum (the default open), and crank FF to max


[21-Dec-23 08:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's a lot of factors in SF speed, but FF is fairly constant usage and speed you get from it. SF will vary heavily based on weight of the ship (full ships can more than double SF for the same time gains)


[21-Dec-23 08:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
and SF only applies when leaving the planet/station and when approaching the end planet/station. FF covers everything in between. So more star systems = more gained from increased FF


[21-Dec-23 08:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
all of this is why I'm now making my ships with an FSE/HYR build


[21-Dec-23 08:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
I don't even like using my HTE/HYR ship because the default SF usage is always >400


[21-Dec-23 12:20 PM] melon164#0000
FSE/HYR is the optimum for me, can always turn the FF down


[21-Dec-23 12:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
for sure, and the minimum HYR is about the same as QCR/RCT - unlike the HTE/AEN where their absolute minimum is both slower than an FSE, and more expensive


[21-Dec-23 06:46 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I just tweak them both until I get flight times that match when I'm likely to be on next

Casually dropping 500k per shipping contract 🤦‍♂️


[21-Feb-24 07:37 AM] melon164#0000
Send me the bills for the other parts as they come in


[21-Feb-24 07:37 AM] melon164#0000
probably 2w for the HYR as I seem to have run out of EES 😕


[21-Feb-24 07:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is it only HRT --> ANT, nothing ANT --> HRT?


[21-Feb-24 09:10 AM] melon164#0000
Yup

I think I can begin moving stuff with my existing ship. It is not in use every couple of days.


[21-Feb-24 09:57 AM] melon164#0000
I'll post a load of shipping contracts on ANT


[21-Feb-24 09:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I can take them into my warehouse on HRT, and move when I get there


[21-Feb-24 10:02 AM] melon164#0000
I've posted them  now


[21-Feb-24 10:03 AM] melon164#0000
Easier to do as shipping contracts than to buy them and sell them back, surely?


[21-Feb-24 10:03 AM] churavis#0000
I have CQM in stock


[21-Feb-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have all my stuff in stock on that sheet, @mrsmith33  you can send me contracts on ANT. You can either pay for them directly or make them 1 AIC and I'll send to melon164 for payment


[21-Feb-24 11:07 AM] mrsmith33#0000
already sent

I was just working myself up to build a batch of them


[23-Feb-24 08:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have a couple


[24-Feb-24 10:43 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Sent you a contract


[26-Feb-24 02:51 AM] melon164#0000
HYR inbound to ANT, I think the differential cost is 800k (200k for BR1-->BR2, 600k for QCR-->HYR).

[26-Feb-24 03:16 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Forgot to include FSE cost (650k) in the last contract. Sent you a contract for HYR where I pay remaining 150k.

[27-Feb-24 11:42 PM] tuffyless#0000
Id imagine a STL ship would stay very busy moving H2O & Agri between a,b,c,d.  haha.  
Make sure to keep extra fuel stocked up.

with my expansion to Ant1a, I have space again for an ECA so I can start making FF drives again


[11-Mar-24 01:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
also have 3 FSE available right now


[11-Mar-24 01:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
and I don't even know the bays... 7 LCB and 4 WCB


[11-Mar-24 01:38 PM] melon164#0000
@higgsy did we never finish the second pair of HYR?  I had two on ANT (one of which I just delivered to martinc), they might have been for you? 🤦‍♂️


[11-Mar-24 01:39 PM] melon164#0000
In which case I have one left, and am working towards another batch


[11-Mar-24 01:39 PM] melon164#0000
I need to set up an EEP again I think, have run out of EES


[11-Mar-24 01:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make plenty, I can sell you


[11-Mar-24 01:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have 30 EES available right now,  but I have an EEP already and over 1k ES lol, so plenty of capacity to make some EES real quick


[11-Mar-24 01:41 PM] melon164#0000
How much?


[11-Mar-24 01:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
just over cost, looks like 28k/u


[11-Mar-24 02:33 PM] melon164#0000
So say 35k/u?


[11-Mar-24 02:39 PM] melon164#0000
I'd happily buy 1-2 EES per day regularly


[11-Mar-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
28k was with the extra 🙂


[11-Mar-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah just ping me to send a contract every week or two then, should be good


[11-Mar-24 03:35 PM] higgsy#0000
You sent me what I ordered previously. I just wanted to make another order of two HYR because I know it takes a long time to make one.


[11-Mar-24 03:39 PM] higgsy#0000
I wonder if building repair drones is a good idea now because it takes extra materials to make ship repairs?


[11-Mar-24 03:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think now you need drone parts to repairs the drones, so it seems like they got worse 😦


[11-Mar-24 03:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
correct

10% damage reduction saved me <1 LHP and 1 SSC, but added 4 DRF 😭


[11-Mar-24 03:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
the small drone takes a flat 2 DRF every repair


[11-Mar-24 03:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
which is pretty bad because 2 DRF = 2 LHP in materials cost

It depends on the price of AL but 6 is a lot compared to just one DCS

[07-Apr-24 11:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
also a BGS because 🤷


[07-Apr-24 11:57 AM] churavis#0000
The GEN is sufficient for a small cargo bay (500k/500k) or smaller, FSE is only necessary for a larger cargo bay


[07-Apr-24 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I like having mine go real fast


[07-Apr-24 12:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can make the SSL and SCB, will take a few days to get the FAL for the SCB, so just send contract for next weekend


[07-Apr-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was looking at a larger cargo bay, but the flight time between ISA and SE-110b was only 30 minutes to an hour, I think


[07-Apr-24 12:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s great, then I can procrastinate on expanding for one more week 😄

No this is perfect. I need to sit down and load balance all the bases i have planned anyway, which is both my most and least favorite part of the game


[07-Apr-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Unless you’re putting it on a small fast ship - then just send me a picture of the flight time and bill me for the fuel so I can be jealous 😂


[07-Apr-24 12:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
well I could send this one, but the fuel bill would be probably twice as much as the part

[08-Apr-24 11:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
both parts will be at ANT in about 5 hours. Just add 15k to the price of the SCB to cover fuel 😛

Was this just a test or do you actually want to build a carrier?


[08-May-24 10:41 PM] exeler#0000
Both 😄


[08-May-24 10:42 PM] exeler#0000
I think I got the prices right from the sheet. If I got something wrong, or you want to sell an item for a different price you can change the price in the modal when creating the offer


[08-May-24 10:43 PM] churavis#0000
In that case, I might just decide to add a zero or two...


[08-May-24 10:43 PM] exeler#0000
If you use a different price, it'll send the offer to me via DM to review before it gets accepted 😉


[08-May-24 10:51 PM] exeler#0000
Please send me the contracts if you place an offer that gets auto-accepted.

If you use a different price per item and the offer goes to me for review, I'll send the contracts when/if I accept the offer.

I need to update the bot to make it more clear about this (and also so it tells the project owner when and who contributed something that was auto accepted)


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Very nice, I like it!


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think when it says `Contribution of 2 MFE for 80000.0 AIC/u automatically accepted`, it should also do the math and multiply out for me 😄

[11-May-24 08:48 AM] melon164#0000

I have all the inputs already, and a bunch of HWP. What price/u is good for you?

I can send the contract once I get back to my PC tomorrow.


[12-May-24 02:12 AM] melon164#0000
I'd calculate it as about 500/u of labour and 13k/u of materials, so say 1k/u or 15k/u depending on whether you want me to supply inputs?

[19-May-24 11:20 AM] allocater#0000
yup, first step is upgrading the 2 starter ships, do you have done that already?


[19-May-24 11:21 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i have one with LCB and the other is default


[19-May-24 11:21 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i wanted to put AGS in both but the CQM was the killer


[19-May-24 11:21 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i just need a 3rd ship because i have to do so much shipping and 2 isn't cutting it i feel like


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] allocater#0000
if you put WCB into the other default one, you get a WCB ship for 500k instead of 5mil. (but you "lose" the default ship of course, still a good deal)


[19-May-24 11:24 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
hmm true, i was gonna do 2k/2k because it's faster than WCB


[19-May-24 11:25 AM] allocater#0000
yeah but LCB is like 2 times better, but 10 times more expensive


[19-May-24 11:25 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
plus, it was more the 3rd ship i needed because the issue isn't shifting weight, it's the quantity of different stuff from different plants lol


[19-May-24 11:26 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i guess once i get my NL production going, i can sell mass Lfabs and make some $$$ quick


[19-May-24 11:26 AM] allocater#0000
sure, 3rd ship will have to be done eventually


[19-May-24 11:26 AM] allocater#0000
also did you get your 5mil starter loan yet?


[19-May-24 11:29 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
uhh no? i didn't know it was a thing lol


[19-May-24 11:30 AM] allocater#0000
send me a contract for it, 0% interest, 60d payback

aww, thanks man.🤝


[19-May-24 11:53 AM] katinga#0000
it's the WCB that's better for LST, right?


[19-May-24 11:54 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
it's an intrest loan right?


[19-May-24 11:55 AM] allocater#0000
yeah

does it need to be a stable loan or something?


[19-May-24 12:46 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
stable loan doesn't let you have 0% interest


[19-May-24 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
huh, I'm getting the same error


[19-May-24 12:48 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
oh, it doesn't let me send it without a number in the interest section


[19-May-24 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
it won't let me save a 0 interest loan

[19-May-24 07:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
unless you actually put the engine at 80-100% power, then an ENG is inferior to an FSE


[19-May-24 07:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
similar with higher end FTL drives, though the fuel scale is linear there so a lot more reasonable to actually go to 100%


[19-May-24 07:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
also don't get an AGS without a T2 STL drive


[19-May-24 07:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
2 more ship sales, I seem to be short 2 QCR and 2 CQM for the next batch


[19-May-24 07:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll do a proper count soon though


[19-May-24 10:45 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Ahh, so just scrap the AGS then for now until I upgrade my STL?


[19-May-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
an AEN is fast, but not fast enough to need an AGS


[19-May-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe a BGS


[19-May-24 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
you wanna look if the G-factor is capping your acceleration


[19-May-24 10:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
and then also factor in most ships can double in weight when carrying stuff, which reduces max acceleration by quite a lot, so even at 100% STL fuel the AGS would still be useless


[19-May-24 11:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sold two more ships today, this time in NCC. Seems like most of the sales are multi-ship sales coming from outside of ANT.


[19-May-24 11:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sent out contracts to people I may have missed to finish off the next batch


[20-May-24 01:36 AM] melon164#0000
I'd say my ship sales have been ~60% NCC, 30% AIC, 5% each ICA/CIS, so that figures


[27-May-24 06:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
3 more ships sold this weekend, for a total of 9 with the program set up this way. Overall I think the program is working pretty well. It's still a ton of clicks to sell a ship, and most of them have asked for currency conversion. (one got a loan as well). I think having them immediately available has been a huge win over other build-to-order options. People really like that.  No customization has been a big win too. No one cares to customize.

I think I can offer SRPs at a _cool_ price of 8k/u


[30-May-24 08:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
it results in 70% damage reduction to any ship


[30-May-24 08:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
takes a lot to make a ship, and not sure if you have to replace them every repair either


[30-May-24 08:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
corresponds to roughly 800k for an LCB ship

Okay so current shipbuilding shortage is 3 LCB and 2 FSE. I assume our two SFKs aren't really fully occupied, and the challenge is getting enough AST / FET to keep them going. Is that true? 

I switched my  two ASMs over to ship-metals and sent some AST to Hern. Maybe as a corp we could encourage a few more ASMs?


[09-Jun-24 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
Is NOZ production also blocked by FAL supply?


[09-Jun-24 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
I could add a manufacturing planet to help if we need more SPF time


[09-Jun-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh good, I just made 2 LCB 🙂

I also swapped Deimos to full ASM earlier this week, the SKF is on Vulcan now


[09-Jun-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
gives me 10 ASM


[09-Jun-24 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm also siphoning off a lot of that new space into CTF though for expected shields upgrades once the update drops


[09-Jun-24 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000

[09-Jun-24 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000

[09-Jun-24 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
I store my BTS on the CX because there's so much of it


[09-Jun-24 02:42 PM] churavis#0000
Antares III d is a metallurgy planet if you need more Than Deimos and Vulcan. I'll be expanding there myself soon. It's a good option if you want to free up room on Deimos for more ASM.


[09-Jun-24 06:55 PM] exeler#0000
I might move my SME off Deimos and turn them into ASM if there's demand for the alloys.

With all the ships I built on a whim recently, I have a ton of extra shipping capacity to do things like shipping metals and ores around 😅


[09-Jun-24 07:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's where I just went, yeah


[12-Jun-24 11:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
why LHP over BHP?


[13-Jun-24 04:10 AM] melon164#0000
LHP is more cheaper than it is badder: yes it needs repairing more frequently, but its cheapness outweighs that so you still save money overall.  Plus they're lighter so your ships accelerate faster with less fuel consumption

[13-Jun-24 09:14 AM] churavis#0000
Has anyone done the calculations to see if that's still true with the changes to repair costs?


[17-Jun-24 04:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I’m switching one of my ships to LHP


[17-Jun-24 04:09 PM] churavis#0000
A new one or an existing ship?


[17-Jun-24 04:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Upgrade starter to WCB


[17-Jun-24 04:10 PM] churavis#0000
It's probably not worth it to change an existing ship to LHP, especially given the recent changes that make hull plates a smaller percentage of repair costs


[17-Jun-24 04:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
When does that change happen tho?


[17-Jun-24 04:12 PM] churavis#0000

[17-Jun-24 05:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
also if you're in the market for some fun shields! I'm making 15 APT and 12 SRP per day. I'd recommend waiting until the shield update drops in a month, but at that point I should have enough for several ships


[17-Jun-24 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
7k/SRP and 6k/APT, comes out to about 100x that for an LCB ship, so 700k or 600k for either. Reduce damage by half with APTs, or to 59% with SRPs, or together drop damage to only 35%!


[17-Jun-24 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
Can you estimate a time for ROI?


[17-Jun-24 05:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
let me do some math, but assuming things change with the update, this math will hopefully look much nicer


[17-Jun-24 05:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
hmmm, until I see the update let's save off on that


[17-Jun-24 05:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
just wanna mention that I'm making them 🙂 also the price will certainly drop when they improve the recipe,


[17-Jun-24 05:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
```On top of that, applying shields to your ship will reduce the amount of hull plate materials you have to provide. The more and higher-tier shields your ship blueprint has, the more hull plates will be deducted from your repair bill, so shields will not just reduce the rate of deterioration but also save on other required repair materials. ```

I'm not sure at what ratio that effect will matter

@tuffyless you can't just drop a 7 day order for 3 LCB🫠 Maybe with the inputs from some corp members but on my own it'll be more like 2 weeks for all 3. You can send contracts for 1 at a time with 2 week timer and I'll fulfill as they come in

[01-Jul-24 10:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
so with SRP and APT should be a 25% (dunno if additive or multiplicative) reduction


[01-Jul-24 10:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
SRP being the only specialized one


[01-Jul-24 10:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
also it's still not on test server so I cannot check yet


[01-Jul-24 10:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
also seems like LHP is still gonna be the way to go


[01-Jul-24 11:24 AM] melon164#0000
Yeah I don’t think those weight changes are good enough


[01-Jul-24 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
the weight changes suck


[01-Jul-24 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
but assuming the damage reduction bonuses are multiplicative, I'm seeing a 50% reduction in repair costs with a fully decked out ship


[01-Jul-24 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
(not the plate reduction bonuses which are new, the existing reduction)


[01-Jul-24 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
.


[01-Jul-24 12:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
additively, even with the changes, it's not a super big deal


[01-Jul-24 12:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll assume additive, just because multiplicative is too good to be true.


[01-Jul-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can run a calibration against my existing ships to see if it's multiplicative or additive


[01-Jul-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
otherwise it'll just have to wait for the patch...


[01-Jul-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
***If anyone has a super decked out ship, please let me know how much damage you take for a given flight***


[01-Jul-24 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
preferably, 2 of 3 shield types


[01-Jul-24 12:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
Here's what I have right now, all repairs at 80%, additive percents, prices are based on rough ideas of profit margins around LHP:

LHP alone = 86k ; time of 180
LHP + APT = 87k ; time of 380
LHP + AWH = 137k ; time of 380
LHP + SRP = 113k ; time of 320
LHP + APT + SRP = 103k ; time of 520
LHP + APT + AWH + SRP = 125k ; time of 720


[01-Jul-24 12:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
time is scaled, so 380/180 = 2.1x as long between repairs


[01-Jul-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
The BTF does damage per flight. I don't have test server access but this is on the normal server: http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_2024-07-01_12-12-22.png

I don't think there's a way to preview repair costs though.

oh yeah, that'll work


[01-Jul-24 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think any of those parts will change, but that's a common short flight for me, and 0.2% to 0.06% is pretty good. As long as repair costs don't go way up


[01-Jul-24 12:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
OH, oh my


[01-Jul-24 12:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
the shields are far more in depth than I thought...


[01-Jul-24 12:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
heat shields - only impact take off and landing


[01-Jul-24 12:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
but 100% mitigates the entire damage cost of taking off and landing


[01-Jul-24 12:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
you just don't take any damage


[01-Jul-24 12:17 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Can you divide repair cost by flight time?


[01-Jul-24 12:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
heat shields don't impact anything else though...


[01-Jul-24 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay so doing the math for all of this isn't really possible in the traditional sense


[01-Jul-24 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
gonna have to take a lot of examples and compile them together instead


[01-Jul-24 12:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
so there are 4 damage categories: Degradation from usage, Meteoroid damage, Radiation damage, and Atmospheric damage


[01-Jul-24 12:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
Hull plates and drones target all 4


[01-Jul-24 12:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
heat shielding = atmosphere


[01-Jul-24 12:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
whipple = meteoroids


[01-Jul-24 12:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
radiation = radiation


[01-Jul-24 12:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
so the only way to impact over time degradation is with better plates and drones. You can completely negate meteoroid and atmospheric damage


[01-Jul-24 12:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
and 70% reduce radiation damage. That leaves you with only 30% radiation damage and usage damage. Observation: for each quality shield you outfit the ship with, it dramatically improves the effect of drones and hull plates


[01-Jul-24 12:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
example:

Travel from ANT -> Demeter
Full FTL drive fuel, default STL
FSE/RCT LCB ship with LFL and MSL,


LHP, no improvements = ~.375%
LHP, all best shields = ~.238%
LHP, all best shields + large drones = ~.216%
AHP, all best shields = ~.152%
AHP, all best shields + large drones = ~.129%


[01-Jul-24 12:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
so very expensive ship gets you about 2.46x improvement on long distance travel like that


[01-Jul-24 12:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
most of the damage is coming from usage, not the other sources - nothing mitigates the usage damage jumps cause besides drones and plates


[01-Jul-24 12:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
but if you look at something like ANT -> Nike, a much shorter travel


[01-Jul-24 12:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's very different


LHP, no improvements = ~.245%
LHP, all best shields = ~.110%
LHP, all best shields + large drones = ~.101%
AHP, all best shields + large drones = ~.059%


[01-Jul-24 12:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
4.1x better


[01-Jul-24 12:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
let me see if I can break down the Nike damage


[01-Jul-24 12:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
Nike has (nearly) no atmosphere, so it only costs .001% to atmosphere losses. This makes APT basically useless for this run
Antares I has meteoroids at .2. AWH give 100% reduction, only giving .003% back here
Antares III has meteoroids at 2.5. AWH here give a HUGE .08% back
Antares I is F class, higher radiation. SRP give 70% reduction, reducing damage by .053%
Antares III is M class, much lower radiation. SRP give nothing back, 0.000%


[01-Jul-24 12:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll see that covers the difference between LHP no shields and LHP + shields


[01-Jul-24 12:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
given Antares I is an F class, I think by far the most consistently useful shield will be SRP. You will almost always get a reduction of .05% for every flight


[01-Jul-24 01:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
with just SRP, going from ANT to Heph costs .241% without SRP, .132% with SRP, so almost 50% savings on repair (this of course depends on system alignment at any time)


[01-Jul-24 01:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
ANT to Astraeus (307e), costs .560% without, .271% with APT


[01-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
any planet that costs HSE will be severely impacted by APT


[01-Jul-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay, I gotta get back to my job and stop procrastinating...

[01-Jul-24 01:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
there's still alot of analysis on costs to do, and what makes sense. Drones and higher hull plates make more and more sense the more shields you add, but some shields will get outsized usage. Each person will have to analyze for themselves meteroid and solar class of their most frequented systems


[01-Jul-24 01:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
for intra-system jumpers, it's an easy analysis (like in Thalassa, Ant 1 or Ant 2)


[01-Jul-24 01:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
whipple shields (for meteoroids) are about 2x as expensive as the other 2 classes of shields

I'm upgrading my Ant I intra system hopper with APT and SRP to see what that repair looks like. I think it's just the same ratio as hull plates, but I'm hoping that's wrong. Will know in the morning

[02-Jul-24 08:40 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's a big deal, all my cost assumptions have been that they're at the same ratio


[02-Jul-24 09:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
running an experiment with a bigger and more damaged ship to get a more accurate %


[02-Jul-24 09:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
gonna be 30 hours for that refurb, and with only APT


[02-Jul-24 09:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
adding shields takes forever 😴


[02-Jul-24 10:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
Compiling some common runs with damage breakdowns to get a good idea of average utility of each shield


[02-Jul-24 10:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
~~Another **Observation**: Whipple shields can actually increase your speed in meteoroid dense systems~~


[02-Jul-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
My ships seem to break pretty fast so this will be pretty nice


[02-Jul-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
oh really? 😮

[02-Jul-24 10:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think that's what's happening here - the only difference is the right one has AWH


[02-Jul-24 10:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
(which technically adds mass, so should be slowing it down)


[02-Jul-24 10:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
the alternative route is 8 hours, so that's not what's happening either


[02-Jul-24 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
That stage is one more unit of fuel, maybe the mass just bumps it over to 16 SF instead of 15 SF?


[02-Jul-24 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Kind of like a weird rounding thing


[02-Jul-24 10:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
ah yeah, because I didn't notice it with any other config


[02-Jul-24 10:37 AM] hernanduer#0000

I think you're right, has to be a weird rounding error


[02-Jul-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
I wish you could specify time on those so you could make them exactly the same

[02-Jul-24 10:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
here's what I've compiled so far


[02-Jul-24 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
you can see the two HSE planets there, ISA and 759d have huge burns on Thermal and bring its value way up


[02-Jul-24 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
Radiation is highly variable, primarily on the _departure_ route from ANT


[02-Jul-24 10:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
most stars in Antares space are M or G and have little SRP cost, basically only Ant 1 is F class


[02-Jul-24 10:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
meteoroids are most prevalent, but whipples shields also cost the most. Now I can do some math to determine each shields' feasibility


[02-Jul-24 10:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
also note that's TOTAL radiation damage, not the 70% protected by SRP


[02-Jul-24 10:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
reducing their effectiveness relatively


[02-Jul-24 10:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
**Observation:** Wear damage from jumping is tied to % use of the drive. Thus, by using higher end drives at lower percentages (to get equal fuel and roughly equal time) you save considerably on wear damage


[02-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
only difference is left has RCT, right has HYR

🤔 

[02-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
same fuel, same time, ~.1% less damage just from reduced wear


[02-Jul-24 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmmm also good to know!


[02-Jul-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
with a regular LHP LCB ship running full FTL drives everywhere


[02-Jul-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
on average, you'll get about 67 trips before having to repair


[02-Jul-24 12:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
interestingly, AHP are way better (if they didn't weigh so much)

[02-Jul-24 12:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
the last column is cost per trip


[02-Jul-24 12:22 PM] churavis#0000
Does that change if you go slower or faster cumulatively?


[02-Jul-24 12:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
slower will reduce usage wear, however usage wear is only 36% of an average trip


[02-Jul-24 12:23 PM] churavis#0000
Right, but does the relative wear between the different shield setups change with faster or slower trips?


[02-Jul-24 12:24 PM] katinga#0000
I can't stand slower, esp on longer trips.  I want to step on the gas a little


[02-Jul-24 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes, that's a good point. All my calculations have been done with default STL and full FTL


[02-Jul-24 12:26 PM] churavis#0000
You'd want to standardize trip time especially as the weight of the ship will change the default STL fuel usage


[02-Jul-24 12:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm still not confident on my repair amounts for the shields, so I'm waiting for these ship retrofits to verify that


[02-Jul-24 12:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
right now I have shields at 50% of the built hull plate amount


[02-Jul-24 12:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
but with the update, hull plates repair costs go down, so should I take 50% of hull plates before or after that decrease based on the shields?


[02-Jul-24 12:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
and is 50% even right


[02-Jul-24 12:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
(for repair costs)


[02-Jul-24 12:54 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Is the table showing numbers befor or after the update?


[02-Jul-24 12:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
after


[02-Jul-24 12:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
I really wish it were easier to test these shields, no one uses them so there isn't any knowledge on them I can find 😄


[02-Jul-24 12:56 PM] churavis#0000
You can't just test them in BLU?


[02-Jul-24 12:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
flight profile, yes, but not repair cost


[02-Jul-24 12:58 PM] churavis#0000
Don't we have the formulas to calculate repair cost for any given condition percentage?


[02-Jul-24 12:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can't find them on FIO wiki or game wiki


[02-Jul-24 12:59 PM] churavis#0000
Maybe ask Molp for it


[02-Jul-24 01:00 PM] churavis#0000
Before it was just condition multiplied by the total number of plates used in construction


[02-Jul-24 01:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, both patches this year have changed it


[02-Jul-24 01:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I just updated my math to take that into account


[02-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
December: Linear decay
January: Shields are now 66% of cost they were previously
March: Hull and shields are now 25% lower than previously


[02-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
so take HP = Linear damage * .75


[02-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
then take shields = HP need at any given amount * .66


[02-Jul-24 01:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
looks like this

[02-Jul-24 01:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
97 plates at 82.25% should cost 13 plates to repair. This looks accurate based on my current ships


[02-Jul-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
given this line, the update they're about to put out would be multiplicative on cost of existing shields. Each shield you add will reduce the cost of the other shields (if this is how it works)


[02-Jul-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
because the # of HP will be reduced


[02-Jul-24 02:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
What were the prices used for LHP and AHP for those?


[02-Jul-24 02:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
LHP=3300, AHP=5000

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Jul-24 02:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
I've been playing with the shield prices, since so much depends on that really


[02-Jul-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
they're all well above floor price, but considering the production chains they go through


[02-Jul-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
they need a lot of margin to pay for it


[02-Jul-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
all invariably use AMLs

[02-Jul-24 02:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's where I sit right now - top is the prices


[02-Jul-24 02:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
you can see, a fully decked ship with AHP+drones+shields is the cheapest by a lot


[02-Jul-24 02:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
but even just AHP+drones is significantly cheaper than LHP (though will fly slower - same speed as a BHP ship now)


[02-Jul-24 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
this assumes the multiplicative behavior I described here .  If repair HP doesn't impact shield repair, then it's right about a wash


[02-Jul-24 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
AHP are gonna be terribly slow to produce, and probably more than 5k each


[02-Jul-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
12 AL -> 8 AL + 10 FET.. 3x the HWP time and the ASM time 🤷‍♂️


[02-Jul-24 02:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's true. But the difference between AHP and HHP is rather significant. 15%


[02-Jul-24 02:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
and you're still lugging around that new weight


[02-Jul-24 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I'd make my next ships with AHP instead of LHP if those cost (and trip) numbers hold up


[02-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
Regarding Churaviis' advice on timing, it looks like the wear damage is the same for EVERY warp jump


[02-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
based on your reactor %


[02-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
minimum = 0 damage, maximum is the same per jump


[02-Jul-24 02:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
.031% per jump with LHP and RCT, .046 per jump with HYR


[02-Jul-24 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd probably take APT/SRP/AWH with my LHP just to save the repair trips, since the cost is comparable. But LHP is always available, and if the prices fluctuate much on the other components, it could throw those cost/trip out of whack


[02-Jul-24 02:53 PM] churavis#0000
So it's just STL parts of the journey that cause damage?


[02-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
STL power changes nothing regarding damage, it looks like


[02-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
FTL only causes damage on the Charge phase


[02-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
linear proportionally, based on reactor usage


[02-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
(the bar, not the % on the bar, confusingly)


[02-Jul-24 02:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
so Min = 44% for an RCT, 0% damage, at halfway between 44% and 100%, it'll cause half the damage, so half of .031%


[02-Jul-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
that % is reduced by drones and hull plates


[02-Jul-24 03:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
All that is to say


[02-Jul-24 03:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
every time you use FTL < 100%, the shields become more useful


[02-Jul-24 03:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
damage percents when ALWAYS doing max FTL

If you don't care about money and just don't want to worry about repair ever, AHP plus all the shields plus Drones is the way to go

[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
upwards


[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
so that full ship is nearly 2x as cost efficient as a basic LHP


[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
not to mention time efficient with not needing to repair


[02-Jul-24 03:34 PM] churavis#0000
Are those market or corp prices?


[02-Jul-24 03:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
market


[02-Jul-24 03:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
but, LHP gives little margin as is - i have that reflected in the other HPs


[02-Jul-24 03:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
besides LHP, the rest is basically just predicted


[02-Jul-24 03:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
since turnover is non-existant right now


[02-Jul-24 03:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
production costs are 
SRP=4700/u
APT=3800/u
AWH=5600/u
AHP=4100/u
HHP=3400/u
RHP=3300/u


[02-Jul-24 03:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
those are already accounting for the increase in formulas in the update, so I don't expect them to change


[02-Jul-24 04:14 PM] exeler#0000
It's also worth noting that LHP often cost more than BHP. 

The demand for LHP is so much higher than BHP that people making BHP are often trying to sell it for less than LHP.


[02-Jul-24 04:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
8 AHP/HWP/d is yeah, pretty terrible


[02-Jul-24 05:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
HOWEVER, you have to keep in mind the lowered demand considering that the AHP makes the ship last longer


[02-Jul-24 05:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
so you need more LHP than any other plate by virtue of it breaking down the fastest


[02-Jul-24 05:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll only need 10 AHP to repair your ship after flying it for 380 trips (which should come out to more than a whole year)


[02-Jul-24 05:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
so a single HWP can support over 400 ships' repair costs, just making AHP


[02-Jul-24 05:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
(not accounting for making plates for new ships)


[02-Jul-24 05:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
10x as many plates are needed right now to support LHP


[02-Jul-24 07:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's a good point, it's probably less time per unit area to maintain a ship


[02-Jul-24 08:04 PM] exeler#0000
Also, the more advanced plates taking longer means that there can be more HWP in the chain vs SME and ASM. When I swap over to making RHP for example, AL piles up in my base due to having tons of SME. I can juggle things nicely like that when I need to make TI or STL with my SME instead of AL


[04-Jul-24 05:05 AM] melon164#0000
So my take on this is that the "smart money" is now to go for max upgrades, and that higher-tier things are strictly better than lower-tier things; but that most of the market is likely not to go where the smart money is?


[04-Jul-24 05:07 AM] melon164#0000
Also I'm intrigued that HPR/HYR are better maintenance-wise even if you never turn them up high


[04-Jul-24 09:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
I got confirmation from Counterpoint that the shields are not tied to the hull plate repairs, so that's a bummer. It'll reduce value a good amount. He did say it maxes at 45% though, so perhaps their wording is poor and APT and AWH actually provide 15% reduction

[04-Jul-24 09:38 AM] melon164#0000
So half measures are not economical, need to go AHP and the whole hog for a cost saving (and epic longevity)?  That [the inversion] is indeed sad 😦


[04-Jul-24 09:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, really gotta go gung ho on it


[04-Jul-24 09:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
LHP just aren't expensive enough for the hull plate savings to matter


[04-Jul-24 09:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
this is using the following damage profile, which depending on your flight style may or may not represent you. If your Wear goes down even a couple %, then shields quickly become more and more powerful

[04-Jul-24 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
Looks like we'll need someone making AWH as well, because leaving off just that shield is a huge hit


[04-Jul-24 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm not setup to make them yet because it's gonna take a few WPLs


[04-Jul-24 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
and all mine are busy 😄

94 AWH requires 24 TK


[04-Jul-24 09:58 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 15 WPL total, and they are constantly busy with NL/KV/COT for Lfabs/Afabs.
I can build 3 more WPL if I outsource BMP/CLF mats. Seems not worth it.


[04-Jul-24 10:23 AM] melon164#0000
I could get set up to make AWH


[04-Jul-24 10:24 AM] melon164#0000
I have all the necessary bases, just need to adjust ratios


[04-Jul-24 10:24 AM] melon164#0000
I also put down an SPP on Heph because it fit nicely into the area, but idk if I'll be able to keep it stocked 🤷‍♂️


[04-Jul-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Some of our new players could start weaving bases (WPL). Even if it's to focus on NL, which is easy to start with and great money at the moment.


[04-Jul-24 11:10 AM] lancercaster#0000
I was planning on getting into LFab production Specifically LSE. WPL Bases are easy to put a month's worth of supplies into and worry about it later!

You can make nylon for LDEs too!


[04-Jul-24 11:15 AM] lancercaster#0000
Oops


[04-Jul-24 11:15 AM] lancercaster#0000
I meant LDE


[04-Jul-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah LDE prices have been really good


[04-Jul-24 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I could probably farm out some KV weaving too, I have a lot of TCL at the moment


[04-Jul-24 01:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
WPLs are also just humungo


[04-Jul-24 01:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
Like 9 is a whole base


[04-Jul-24 01:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm close to my next base, maybe we make one of those 6115's bases manufacturing just for WPLs?


[04-Jul-24 01:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
@archielvahr


[04-Jul-24 01:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
Electronics and manufacturing small bits are heavily linked too


[04-Jul-24 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm that's an interesting idea


[04-Jul-24 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
We could make it manufacturing permanently or temporarily. Or we could run the WPLs off-COGC. Their workforce costs are relatively low


[04-Jul-24 01:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
Romulan A is manufacturing


[04-Jul-24 01:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I'm not a fan of TSH


[04-Jul-24 01:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh nvm, read it bad, it's just HSE


[04-Jul-24 02:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
Do WPLs use TEC, by any chance?


[04-Jul-24 02:03 PM] mrsmith33#0000
only settlers


[04-Jul-24 02:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ah, shame - thought that might be a nice way to use up TECs on the electronics planets


[04-Jul-24 02:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
and they're a funky size, where you can only fit 9 and then have a bunch of wasted space


[04-Jul-24 02:06 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 2 bases: 7 WPL + 6 BMP and 8 WPL + CLF + 2 BMP


[04-Jul-24 02:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
looks like an entire WPL base will support a single HWP making AWH all the time

I just get annoyed sourcing TSH, that's why I started making my own


[04-Jul-24 02:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
7 WPL + 3 CLF is the best configuration I've found, it actually uses 500/500


[04-Jul-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's what I've been running on Astraeus for the last year


[04-Jul-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
with a 7:4:4 NL:KV:TK ratio, you still make just enough NL for full HMS production, while giving just enough TK for AWH on an HWP


[04-Jul-24 02:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
Well not a whole HWP, I'm considering a ratio of 1:2:2 ATP:AHP:AWH for 2 HWPs


[04-Jul-24 02:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
about 70% of 1 HWP


[04-Jul-24 02:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
enough for 20 AWH/d

How does everyone feel about me assembling some of our ships for internal members, with me buying parts at our internal prices? Like another 5-ship bunch?


[08-Jul-24 02:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Some of the external ships have been bought by people in the corp, in which case I could discount my contributions, but not other people's contributions.


[08-Jul-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Personally I am very much overflowing on LFE, MFE, SFE, and FFCs.


[08-Jul-24 07:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't really have a huge excess


[08-Jul-24 07:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
Corp members shouldn't be silly about it though, they should come in here and buy


[08-Jul-24 07:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I still prioritize corp orders over others


[08-Jul-24 07:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I would buy more


[08-Jul-24 08:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m still in the market for some ships to put my HYR in 😁


[08-Jul-24 08:20 PM] tuffyless#0000
Im in the market for several boats too but have been waiting to see how the Shield update develops, before buying the Engines & accessories.


[08-Jul-24 08:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
Same here for everything but the reactors 😄


[08-Jul-24 08:22 PM] tuffyless#0000
According to Hern's analysis, may perhaps be looking to buy more advanced engines like HYR / HTE (*or AEN / HPR*)


[08-Jul-24 11:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
HTE and AEN aren't worth it IMO


[08-Jul-24 11:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
they need to improve fuel burn


[08-Jul-24 11:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
HYR are great though, especially if you run shields


[09-Jul-24 02:19 AM] melon164#0000
I'm stepping up my HPR/HYR production again 😁


[09-Jul-24 02:19 AM] melon164#0000
I agree though, AEN/HTE are still for vanity projects


[09-Jul-24 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
@parisinspringtime now that I have the MFL at Ant, I just realized that contract you sent is MFE not MFL


[09-Jul-24 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000

multi line contracts would be reallllllly nice


[09-Jul-24 10:21 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I'm sure I'd mess those up too.


[09-Jul-24 10:22 AM] akyantor#0000
At least you could have pre-made contracts for kit ships.


[09-Jul-24 10:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
at least you could just set it up once for the BLU you want


[09-Jul-24 10:22 AM] akyantor#0000
And then reuse them


[09-Jul-24 10:22 AM] hernanduer#0000

[09-Jul-24 01:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Wow


[09-Jul-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I'm gonna build two of the AHP / All shields / large drones ships. I'm planning on building two SPPs on Heph. But I shouldn't start building until the patch since the output of those recipes is going to double. 

I don't have any HWP and probably won't add any (unless I drop an FP planet, I couldn't really support one) 

@hernanduer  Is this the best blueprint to optimize repair cost per trip with our current understanding of the mechanics?

HYR to reduce wear over QCRs


[09-Jul-24 02:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's my understanding


[09-Jul-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
These will be running the ANT -> OS-099 trips, probably.


[09-Jul-24 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay awesome. So my bottlenecks will probably be AHPs and ATPs (to make APTs) both in HWPs. ... wow these mat names are rough 😛


[09-Jul-24 02:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
I mix those two up so much 🥲


[09-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
I did setup a second HWP


[09-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
and I've allocated another 5 labs for TCL and THF


[09-Jul-24 02:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
the TK is the real killer, I'm about saved up for my next permit which is gonna be another WPL base that'll make the TK


[09-Jul-24 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the fact that everything seems to require a ton of FET / WAL / whatever else is rough too.


[09-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, lots of AML action


[09-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
and ASM


[09-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
everything requires an AML component


[09-Jul-24 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
every shield


[09-Jul-24 02:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have a bunch of open permits, so I could spin up WPL or something else if it helps in the short term


[09-Jul-24 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a lot of AML time, and I think as a corp we have a ton of W...


[09-Jul-24 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I could feed you TCL!


[09-Jul-24 02:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's for KV, right?


[09-Jul-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I got 153725 PG and 750+ TCL that I am slowly chipping away at. Let me see if I can feed a whole permit of WPLs

[09-Jul-24 02:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
@.urpalhal  makes me 61 to 77 TCL per day on this base, and I make a little more on Griff. This eats 90 per day, but we could always swap to RCO and still make some profit. So let's do it @sidepipe  😄 Just lemme know how you want it arranged. 

WPL bases also make great profit on NL too, so it would be a good base for you to keep. Can put it on Heph or Astraeus or any manu planet

Let me play around with prunplanner a bit this evening and get back to you - I was also considering dropping a few BMPs on Heph to lower my input costs a bit, so I'll see if it makes sense to do 6 WPL + some BMPs or if we should just go all-in on WPL 😄

A stupid question, but what happens if you upgrade a damaged ship? Does it repair everything in the process, just the components replaced, or leave any new componets damaged an equivalent amount?


[14-Jul-24 10:40 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a partially damaged starter ship that I'm going to be upgrading to a WCB, so need to figure out what to do...


[14-Jul-24 11:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
you always wanna repair before doing an upgrade, because it will not repair and now you have to pay the new cost to repair


[14-Jul-24 11:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
unless you're downgrading I guess, then wait to repair. But there's not much reason to downgrade


[14-Jul-24 11:09 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, it looks pretty cheap to do the repairs, so will grab the parts to do that.


[16-Jul-24 09:57 AM] hernanduer#0000

Wait for the space elevators


[17-Jul-24 09:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Would be interesting to have big ships that cannot land on the surface, that always require elevators.


[17-Jul-24 09:59 AM] katinga#0000
Or bigger engines to escape the gravity well of a planet

A quick question. Are ship projects always a standard length of time to complete? Or does it depend on the nature of the upgrade?


[17-Jul-24 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
It does vary a little based on the project


[17-Jul-24 10:17 AM] akyantor#0000
I think building a new ship was around 24 hours


[17-Jul-24 10:17 AM] akyantor#0000
Are upgrades any shorter? Will be doing an WCB upgrade soon and wondered how long the ship will be out of action. 😛


[17-Jul-24 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't remember, I think upgrades are less


[17-Jul-24 10:40 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess I'll find out


[17-Jul-24 10:40 AM] akyantor#0000
... in about 4 hours when the ship gets to Heph to do the upgrade


[17-Jul-24 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's based on the volume of the ship I think


[17-Jul-24 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000

Got a question. Is the Large FTL Fuel Tank not worth it? I currently have one on all my ships but, I'm wondering if anyone else uses it.


[19-Jul-24 07:11 AM] mrsmith33#0000
for me small is always enough


[19-Jul-24 07:12 AM] lancercaster#0000
:o


[19-Jul-24 07:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
It doesn't really add much weight/volume/cost to the ship, so sometimes I add one. even for very long trips it doesn't get used up. but it can let you burn harder on trips with a lot of jumps and a fancy enough ftl engine


[19-Jul-24 09:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
I always do LFLs, but I only go up to medium for MSL


[19-Jul-24 09:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
You can totally use half of it flying at top speed to Demeter, it's the key decider in how far your ships can fly


[19-Jul-24 09:07 AM] lancercaster#0000
This is what I do too.


[19-Jul-24 02:05 PM] melon164#0000
Gah, just taken a load of APT from ANT back to Hephaestus thinking it was ATP and I could turn it into... more APT

[23-Jul-24 10:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
caveats there - the hull damage is 0'd on LHP, not BHP. So for example, AHP is 36% instead of 40%


[23-Jul-24 10:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
most things are calculated automatically except that hull plate percent, so you just change the shield type from NA to whatever


[23-Jul-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
then you change the # of Trips, that'll update the hull percent and all the repair amounts


[23-Jul-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
so the way I do it is I fiddle with the # of Trip until it gets to just above 80% - since that's where you'll typically repair


[23-Jul-24 10:59 AM] katinga#0000
I may need to rehull the ship that I use at Romulus.  It is taking a lot of damage ferrying goods within that system.


[23-Jul-24 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
it has a high meteroid density, you probably want AWH. SRP probably won't do much since it's an M class star


[23-Jul-24 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
if any of the planets use HSE, you'll want APT as well


[23-Jul-24 11:01 AM] katinga#0000
okay.  as soon as I look up some of those acronyms


[23-Jul-24 11:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
on the BLUeprint screen, whipple shields = AWH and thermal shields = APT

@hernanduer do you still produce these?


[26-Jul-24 11:50 AM] katinga#0000
someone pointed out to me that shielding also needs to be repaired with the ship repairs.  so is it cost effective to add it over better hull plates?


[26-Jul-24 11:54 AM] archielvahr#0000

[26-Jul-24 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Because some combinations aren't cost effective, but if you put everything on, it generally is


[26-Jul-24 12:05 PM] katinga#0000
I am repairing too often on a ship with LHP ferrying materials around the Romulan system.  I need a turtle instead of a jackrabbit


[26-Jul-24 12:11 PM] katinga#0000
I don't think BRP or SRP would benefit me in that system.  the main problem is the meteoroids and pressure


[26-Jul-24 02:18 PM] katinga#0000
I could add AHP to this and should get a turtle, yes?  I do have an STS already


[26-Jul-24 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think the AHP are drastically slower anymore


[26-Jul-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
they are heavier than LHP


[26-Jul-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
there's not a item in Hern's sheet for your exact makeup


[26-Jul-24 02:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yes but it'll take some time I just sold them all to Archiel


[26-Jul-24 02:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
The sweet spot for savings that Hern found was AHP + drones + all the shielding, otherwise it can cost a bit more. But if that's a puddle jumper, then you know the system stats


[26-Jul-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's for the average, if you're doing an intra system hauler, or just really favor certain systems, you can really build for that system


[26-Jul-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
But I would recommend AHP for any ship with shields


[26-Jul-24 02:27 PM] katinga#0000
puddles are the least of my worries.  my ships can get wet


[26-Jul-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
And if you are mostly wanting to improve duration between repairs, you'll want drones probably. ?


[26-Jul-24 02:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
Like AWH make no sense for an Ant 1 puddlejumper


[26-Jul-24 02:29 PM] katinga#0000
This is for the ship that I use for my Romulan bases.  I'm using it as ferry across Rom C, Romulus, and Remus.  but the high meteroid factor for that system beats the sh*t out of my ship


[26-Jul-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah, 2.9. That's worse than Thalassa at 2.7


[26-Jul-24 02:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
And a single HSE planet can do a ton of damage too


[26-Jul-24 02:31 PM] katinga#0000
I need to mitigate that damage.  it's like aluminum siding against softball sized hail


[26-Jul-24 02:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think we need more in-corp ASM products


[26-Jul-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Shortage for advanced shields/plates, plus for my UPFs, plus fuel tanks and cargo bays

[26-Jul-24 02:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
Titanium


[26-Jul-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000

[26-Jul-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
And the market prices are bananas for costs


[26-Jul-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
So I never buy TI on market


[26-Jul-24 02:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
LancerCaster is starting up a AHP focused base, I imagine we could benefit from more than one similar to that


[26-Jul-24 02:42 PM] katinga#0000
I can look for a place to put a TIO base


[26-Jul-24 02:51 PM] katinga#0000
I think that I can get a TIO base online by Sunday


[26-Jul-24 03:50 PM] lancercaster#0000

Should go back to my original plan for KI-401: extract TIO on KI-401b and smelt it to TI, ship it to KI-401a as a high-tier metallurgy planet to run ASMs


[26-Jul-24 04:24 PM] melon164#0000
It's only PiBoy keeping 401a as construction


[26-Jul-24 04:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

maybe I gotta make more ASMs and just buy my metals instead of running SMEs... 🤔


[28-Jul-24 10:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've gotten a second offer from outside the corp of people who want to sell me ship components- like helping out with ship component production for my ship sales. I haven't really responded, because I'm a bit unsure where our shortages lie. 

Related, I can do another batch of 5 ships (internal sales or external sales, I am willing to track which is which). Does anyone have a ton of components laying around? or are supplies still short?


[28-Jul-24 11:43 PM] hernanduer#0000

[29-Jul-24 01:37 AM] melon164#0000
I'd be interested in buying in some intermediates: I really hate making DEC for crew quarters, for instance, and we never seem to have enough TI.  Most of the margin in ship components is in the final product 😉


[29-Jul-24 09:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I've thought about offering a profit sharing in corp to help support TI and ASM product producers


[29-Jul-24 09:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
if it sells out of corp for example, in corp prices are already minimal cost


[29-Jul-24 10:07 AM] akyantor#0000
I’ve thought a few times about trying to get into shipbuilding,l as it’s probably a bit more interesting than fab production. 

It seems that most of the production chains to produce the end goods are very complicated, with not many of the intermediary goods being useful, so hard to get into as a new player.

So for now I sort of parked it… until I finish my short term bfab/lfab plan.


[29-Jul-24 10:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
There are zero AWH available anywhere, so if you want to do just a chain for a single component, I feel like that one might be good. yeah it's a niche item, but there's two open orders for them in corp already


[29-Jul-24 10:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also think if we offered a fully kitted out ship instead of the LHP 2k/2k, we'd get more sales at our premium price point


[29-Jul-24 10:19 AM] akyantor#0000
I’ll have a look at that chain.


[29-Jul-24 10:20 AM] akyantor#0000
It’d be good to have some variety beyond just fabs.


[29-Jul-24 10:24 AM] akyantor#0000
If it's helpful for corp ship sales, may consider getting a bank of oog loan to stand up the additional planets to build the production chain. Additional permits are still relatively speaking cheap (for me at 9 bases), so most of it would go towards the buildings/bases to get up and running.


[29-Jul-24 10:27 AM] akyantor#0000
Will have to do some research


[29-Jul-24 10:28 AM] akyantor#0000
Looks like step one would be TI production, which sounds useful anyway...


[29-Jul-24 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
That would be a great use of bank funds, I think we could get a couple of bases up. An SKF + all the ASMs to support it. I now have one UPF, we should have one more too.


[29-Jul-24 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Shrewdsun has extra TI and Katinga was considering some


[29-Jul-24 10:30 AM] katinga#0000
Yeah, I have 1 ship where the LHP isn't cutting it


[29-Jul-24 11:03 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If anyone need the TI just let me know, iv setup a base that clearly wasn’t worth it but while its there might as well make you guys benefit from it


[29-Jul-24 11:04 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv got 60 a day I bring to the CX but I can move it elsewhere as well


[29-Jul-24 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
that's like 7 ASMs worth of FET 😉 If there are any takers out there


[29-Jul-24 11:22 AM] lancercaster#0000
I'll take it! Saves me a base on WU-070a!


[29-Jul-24 11:24 AM] lancercaster#0000
I'll buy it at ANT or Vulcan!


[29-Jul-24 11:34 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Great! Ant is best but if it makes a big difference I can do Vulcan


[29-Jul-24 11:34 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
You can just send me a contract for whenever you need some with like 3-4 days lead time, I fly there pretty often

Just researching AWH. The supply chain for AWH isn't entire uncomplicated, but it does look like some of the intermediaries are useful for quite a few different ship parts. e.g. CTF & TK (KV useful anyway for rfabs & afabs later).

AWH still needs more time


[30-Jul-24 06:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have 80 AWH, so one more run should do it, should be on ANT by the weekend


[30-Jul-24 07:34 PM] katinga#0000
no rush


[30-Jul-24 07:36 PM] katinga#0000
I might wind up switching out the LHP for something sturdier as well.


[30-Jul-24 07:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
It's worth it for the shields, both because it means farther times between repairing shields, and the shields reduce the number of plates needed


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] katinga#0000
so this is a typical 2k/2k ship with LHP on it now that I am repairing nearly every time I bring it back to ANT from the Romulan system.  I need to turn it from a snowflake into a rhino, even if it's a little slower.


[31-Jul-24 03:25 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, having done a bit of research on the path to producing AWH... it's going to take a while. I've planned out in more detail the first 2 steps (completing my current bfab/lfab plan, and expanding CL production). Still a lot to figure out:

[31-Jul-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
The first two main steps should be quite doable in the next week or so hopefully... with the profits from selling my next batch of goods.


[31-Jul-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
I think is likely have excess of various useful intermediaries that might enable me to help out with some other types of ship component by the time I was done.


[31-Jul-24 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see extraction bases for almost every item that's needed there. Do you know what the oversupply will be on them? Like TI we might have in-house, and personally my CL production doesn't really run though thaaaaat much HAL


[31-Jul-24 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
It is nice to overproduce for other people though, so it's sort of a matter of style


[31-Jul-24 04:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah. We might even have a HAL guy here 😄


[31-Jul-24 04:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
👀


[31-Jul-24 04:39 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I still have a full TI smelting base


[31-Jul-24 04:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I had discussed with @lancercaster , don’t know if the intention is still to buy, if not that can be checked off


[31-Jul-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
The AWH is metallurgy so it could go alongside the SMEs. Depends how hard you want to go. I see the note for 2 bases of CTF, hehe


[31-Jul-24 04:53 PM] akyantor#0000
I’ve not given much thought to what products I might buy rather than produce yet. Still need to work along the supply chain, making more detailed plans.


[31-Jul-24 04:54 PM] akyantor#0000
The CL I already consume 1/3 of what I’d produce on Elon, it’s quite profitable, and frees up space for me to put something more interesting on Griffonstone (like more labs)


[31-Jul-24 04:54 PM] akyantor#0000
The rest I don’t know yet, as I’ve figured it out yet in prinplanner


[31-Jul-24 04:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
You forgot a super important input to CTFs, the W


[31-Jul-24 04:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
You'd need 1 AML per 2 ASM basically


[31-Jul-24 04:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
Oh I guess it's a sub bullet


[31-Jul-24 04:59 PM] akyantor#0000
I think it’s in point 5.3 and 5,4


[31-Jul-24 04:59 PM] akyantor#0000
An expensive sub point


[31-Jul-24 04:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's by far the most expensive part of the chain 😁


[31-Jul-24 05:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
Figured it deserved its own bullet

[31-Jul-24 05:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
But the WPLs are also pretty ridiculous, I have a base making TK and HMS only, and it can only output about 20 AWH/d


[31-Jul-24 05:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
60 HMS and 3.8 TK/d


[31-Jul-24 05:03 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I expect they’ll be quite space intensive


[31-Jul-24 05:03 PM] akyantor#0000
I’ve 5 already for NL


[31-Jul-24 05:03 PM] akyantor#0000
For lfab production. This will need more


[31-Jul-24 05:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, they're humungo buildings


[31-Jul-24 05:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm just hoping the demand is there, it's gonna take some convincing


[31-Jul-24 05:05 PM] akyantor#0000
I have realised I’m missing labs for THF


[31-Jul-24 05:05 PM] akyantor#0000
Need to add that


[31-Jul-24 05:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I make a good amount of THF and could do more 🙂


[31-Jul-24 05:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
#3 in the galaxy right now! which is probably not a good thing


[31-Jul-24 05:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
again, not that you shouldn't build all these bases yourself. but I'm more than happy to sell to you


[31-Jul-24 05:06 PM] akyantor#0000
Doh, I meant TCL


[31-Jul-24 05:06 PM] akyantor#0000
THF is the one for INS not the TCL required for KV


[31-Jul-24 05:13 PM] akyantor#0000
Thinking about it I’m probably going to start with the production lines that overlap with demand I’d have if I went into rfab/afab  production, and see if I can buy the other goods. 

Will have to see how viable that is, as it’d mean I’d have less to scrap if it turned out there was not demand


[31-Jul-24 05:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, I think the demand can appear if the general universe is shown the usefulness of shields


[31-Jul-24 05:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
But it's gonna require some preaching in UFO chat, I think


[31-Jul-24 05:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
Right now Archiel and I are basically the only people making all of these lol


[31-Jul-24 05:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I got two ships waiting on the AWH and there's none available anywhere in the universe, heh

Anyone have an RDL? We probably need someone to make a DRS if no one has


[01-Aug-24 12:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
Also need an STS


[01-Aug-24 07:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have 2 RDL on ANT, send over contracts!


[02-Aug-24 03:33 AM] _bojidar#0000
I will repeat my self but if its going to help people in corp/ or if simply have excess / i'm willing to pay 5mill or even more per ship if one care to  assemble full set for 2/2, 1/3 or 3/1 ships with 2000ff/3500sf fuel tanks and deliver it /i can help with hauls as well if needed/ to any shipbuilding planet. too much work for me to deal with each part separately  and all...would be better to buy from corp/not asking for discounts or anything/ instead outside...but so far all seems as lazy as me to do that 🙂  I dont really need more ships but still better to do something with these currencies

[02-Aug-24 01:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @katinga  did you need any AHP? @lancercaster  has some available


[02-Aug-24 01:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if anyone wanted some, they can buy them first, otherwise I'll take em


[02-Aug-24 01:54 PM] lancercaster#0000
68 AHP to whomever is willing to take em!


[02-Aug-24 02:48 PM] katinga#0000
I'll take some!  i am going to have to rehull on of my ships eventually.  I want to start a stockpile


[02-Aug-24 03:09 PM] lancercaster#0000
How many do you want?


[02-Aug-24 03:33 PM] katinga#0000
lots.  i think I'm going to need 94 for a 2k/2k ship?


[02-Aug-24 03:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
94 up to 103 depending on the extras


[02-Aug-24 03:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
more for a gas 1k/3k I think 🤷‍♂️


[03-Aug-24 12:22 AM] tuffyless#0000
So, I dont mean to ping Archy ...
But to ask if this is still the top notch all-star design?


[03-Aug-24 12:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
If you want the most efficient build, yep yep


[03-Aug-24 12:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
You'll be able to get something like 300 average trips between repairs


[03-Aug-24 12:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's slightly slower, just because of the weight of AHP vs LHP


[03-Aug-24 12:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
So that's a minor tradeoff


[03-Aug-24 12:27 AM] tuffyless#0000
amazing summary.  ty Hern.


[03-Aug-24 12:28 AM] tuffyless#0000
I'd like to get in line to start ordering some mats


[03-Aug-24 12:28 AM] tuffyless#0000
but know things are kinda in limbo with the recent change ups


[03-Aug-24 12:28 AM] tuffyless#0000
both change ups like with the new upcoming mats and things happening like Churaviis.


[03-Aug-24 12:29 AM] tuffyless#0000
So not sure where to get in-line and get queued with order requests for ship parts


[03-Aug-24 12:35 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What's the price of all plates/shields/drones for 2k ship?


[03-Aug-24 09:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'd be curious about this too 🙂


[03-Aug-24 09:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, Hern has a whole sheet on it- it's the new all star design- since it wasn't previously that good.


[03-Aug-24 09:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
There's not really a formal queue, so just put in an order. Katinga has some open orders for the fancier materials. I need to recount the inventory for the standard 2k


[03-Aug-24 10:16 AM] akyantor#0000
Do you know if we've made any assumptions for the prices per unit for AWH?


[03-Aug-24 10:18 AM] akyantor#0000
I've been doing some back of the napkin math if I were to buy at least some of the input materials (TIO, CTK), and it seems like it'd be quite a lot for a 2k ship, perhaps 500k per ship. It'd probably be affordable to make it cheaper if I were to have the whole production chain in place.


[03-Aug-24 10:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I've put my corp prices in the sheet at least


[03-Aug-24 10:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
my TK prices look around 11k at cost, and that's the main driver of AWH. I'm showing cost for AWH at 5800, so I priced that up to 9k considering the number of bases involved


[03-Aug-24 10:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, that tallys up in the same universe as my calculations. I'm glad I'm not completely off piste. And you're right, it's quite a production chain to pull together for the one item, at least compared to the items I've built so far. *I've not fully broken down the CTF cost yet, so just plugged in your corp price for CTF for now.*


[03-Aug-24 10:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
CTF is about 5600


[03-Aug-24 10:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
at cost


[03-Aug-24 10:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
huh, so guess it's really pretty 50/50 between the TK and CTF cost


[03-Aug-24 10:50 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I think so


[03-Aug-24 10:51 AM] akyantor#0000
The HE/TI are somewhat small beer by comparison


[03-Aug-24 10:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah they're basically decimal points


[03-Aug-24 10:52 AM] akyantor#0000
I think for that reason if I am to focus on AWH, probably best buy those mats, and focus on production chains for the TK and CTF.


[03-Aug-24 11:56 AM] akyantor#0000
A slightly different question. What’s a reasonable pace for ship production?


[03-Aug-24 11:59 AM] akyantor#0000
Once every week


[03-Aug-24 11:59 AM] akyantor#0000
Every other week?


[03-Aug-24 12:10 PM] akyantor#0000
I’m not sure what the general demand is to judge what kind of pace I should aim for.


[03-Aug-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's tough to say, because I think internally people might be just doing upgrades at first. I feel like external ship sales might still include the standard 2k without AWH. If the community isn't buying into the advantages of the shields, then they won't stomach the price for them


[03-Aug-24 12:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, I plan to go on a campaign in UFO once internal demand dwindles

Does anyone make CQS?


[03-Aug-24 02:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 1 CQS and 4 CQT from Churaviis


[03-Aug-24 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have no idea what to do with them so if you want it, it's yours


[03-Aug-24 02:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Should I make those?


[03-Aug-24 02:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
along with CQM and CQL?


[03-Aug-24 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Making CQM and a few CQL would be good and profitable. They are often a bottleneck. I have a handful of extra ADRs to get you started. I think CQS and CQT are just for people who want their 12th ship to be a tiny fast EDC mover, and they probably represent like 1 in 50 ships produced


[03-Aug-24 02:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well I want to make 2 more WCB asd those need CQS


[03-Aug-24 02:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
I bet the CQS and CQT on the CX have been sitting there forever


[03-Aug-24 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
ohhh, yup they sure do. good point


[03-Aug-24 02:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
HAL mover 1 and 2


[03-Aug-24 02:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so should I make a mixed UPF and WEL base or just UPF?


[03-Aug-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, you can have 5 ADR for 70k on Nike if you want them


[03-Aug-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I find it to be a fair bit of work to keep one UPF busy. How many is a full base of them?


[03-Aug-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
And how many PPF bases does it take to support that many UPFs?


[03-Aug-24 02:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000

How is the ship building arranged here? I say Insula’s offer and I’m curious how we could use it


[03-Aug-24 02:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Is it just « every one does pieces and then individually people assemble them » or is there an effort to balance the production?


[03-Aug-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
I sell excess on the CX


[03-Aug-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
but the amount of excess ebbs and flows with internal demand


[03-Aug-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
there's no attempt to individually balance, but that's because historically we've had surplus


[03-Aug-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
right now we are missing an AAF and UPF maker


[03-Aug-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think Archiel has them but not sure if he's able to supply them?


[03-Aug-24 02:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
I know both BR1 and BR2 are needed, as are CQS/M/L


[03-Aug-24 02:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
and RDLs


[03-Aug-24 02:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
(which that's a DRS building)


[03-Aug-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have an AAF, I now have one UPF and am able to keep it busy. I think it's good now. At first I had to make some HABs to keep it busy


[03-Aug-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can make the I  have the SRDs to make 19 more RDLs. Which is a lot of RDLs


[03-Aug-24 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can eat up 7 of them in the coming months 😄


[03-Aug-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
so if Hal goes ham on crew quarters, that can free mine up for RDLs


[03-Aug-24 02:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seapear's corp was gonna build ships but they super-balanced it out among everyone, and everytime someone left it entirely crumbled (probably because ASM inputs were so distributed)


[03-Aug-24 02:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
so that's one reason it's not super organized.

[03-Aug-24 03:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
At least if there was a way to know the gaps, it would be easier for someone to come in and fill it


[03-Aug-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think the better way to go about it is to setup a UPF line, and then sell excess on market


[03-Aug-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
there's always demand on market


[03-Aug-24 03:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
it can be slow though, so not recommended for new players


[03-Aug-24 03:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably want at least 10 bases to absorb the idle capital

they have a profitable MM, surprisingly


[03-Aug-24 03:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I could make an obscene number of SNMs for someone though


[03-Aug-24 03:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
which one?

NV2


[03-Aug-24 03:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
not as good as IDC or EDC, but enough to justify having an AAF


[03-Aug-24 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe we'll need CCs or TACs for gateways


[03-Aug-24 03:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
could be, could be...

So iv got an option to buy a large number of ships, anyone would be interest in a ship in the 5.5mil range. I would be able to get quite a bit of them


[03-Aug-24 08:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
It that evoV? I was thinking we should offer to buy his entire stock for a discount. that is probably 100m AIC or a bit more.


[03-Aug-24 08:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
It is, I did negotiate a good price for ships with him if the volume is high. I was hoping to turn around and sell them for a profit. I already have a buyer for 15-20 of them


[03-Aug-24 08:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
He has 15 ready for sale


[03-Aug-24 09:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah go for it. I can roll some into the corp sales container if you end up with too many


[03-Aug-24 09:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I only have like 30m AIC liquid though, if you need help with the up front payment


[03-Aug-24 09:10 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ill let you know if I need a hand with liquidity for the payment. 
I’ve sold 15 ships so far, then the rest I can get 5 per weeks after that

If you want some Individual components let me know, I can probably get those as well


[04-Aug-24 04:34 AM] akyantor#0000
I think I'll probably target making a set of AWH materials for a 2k no more frequently than fornightly to start until it's clear what demand there may be. I may have some intermediary materials at a higher volume where there's overlap with needs for rfabs and afabs, so I can pivot between faster AWH production or expanding into more advanced fabs.

Since i cant expand anymore, im studying different business lines i can get involved in and being a sort of ship salesman/broker is intersting.
If you produce some ship components, is there a price youd be willing to sell them at?


[04-Aug-24 06:59 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
this being said, there is enormous demand for ships. I just an hour yesterday, iv got interest in buying 20+ ships


[04-Aug-24 06:59 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If anyone produces components let me know so i can assemble kits


[04-Aug-24 07:17 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
In response to Archiel's comment, here is his left overstock with the price. Might not be competitive for all of them but if there is interest let me know

[04-Aug-24 07:17 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Negative are where there already isnt enough parts to cover the sold ships


[04-Aug-24 09:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
This shipbuilding sheet has various prices on it (CX, internal sales, external sales, GTU's price, etc)

[04-Aug-24 09:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
(4th sheet in the workbook)


[04-Aug-24 09:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Someone buying the 20+ ships is pretty great, I have a lot of questions lol. The ones I had on offer here https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1235430108127432754 always sold out, but they did sit for a couple weeks, and that was 5 at a time.


[04-Aug-24 09:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Not sure if you sold much under 6,280,000  each or if the layout of the ships were different


[04-Aug-24 09:09 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
5.5 mil off of a 5.2 mil cost for me


[04-Aug-24 09:09 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I basicly messaged people directly saying i had ship to sale


[04-Aug-24 09:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hm nice


[04-Aug-24 09:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Just going off lists of people in discord you thought might be interested?


[04-Aug-24 09:11 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
basicly yeah


[04-Aug-24 09:12 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
probably could have sold at a higher price but i really need the money and im still making like 4.5mil+ profit on the whole thing


[04-Aug-24 09:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah cool


[04-Aug-24 09:12 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Aslo went on the LEAD for ship number, not confirmed yet but i have someone linned up for 4 ships there


[04-Aug-24 09:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
okay yeah I punched in all those numbers into the shipbuilding chart for price reference. They are pretty much all under CX price. Which is why the OOG shipbuilding prices have been higher


[04-Aug-24 09:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
I keep considering dropping them but I don't feel like I can mandate prices for everyone in the corp that are lower necessarily


[04-Aug-24 09:17 AM] akyantor#0000
It feels like there should be a premium on CX, otherwise you're not getting any value for putting the package together and may as well just put them parts on the CX.


[04-Aug-24 09:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
esp if the stuff is celling on the CX


[04-Aug-24 09:18 AM] akyantor#0000
There's value in complete kits I'd think.


[04-Aug-24 09:18 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im gonna send the contracts to buy the pieces later today (thats gonna suck) if you want me to buy some to set aside for you just let me know before that


[04-Aug-24 09:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
Right, the kit should be more- because CX supply is inconsistent and you can't always assemble a whole ship there


[04-Aug-24 09:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Well regarding those stock numbers: He's short on LFE MFE and SFE, I have 50-100 of each ot those in stock. I have a ton of SSC.


[04-Aug-24 09:19 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My target for future sales would be 5.7m, this would net me 500k/ship. Currently I would be able to source 5 ship per week


[04-Aug-24 09:19 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
hum interesting, i would be interested in completing some more ships for sale


[04-Aug-24 09:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I would juste have to run the numbers


[04-Aug-24 09:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
I definitely want any and all of the MFL you can spare out of there.


[04-Aug-24 09:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Alhought CQM is also gonna be a blocker


[04-Aug-24 09:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
Not when Hal's mega UPF base is done 😄


[04-Aug-24 09:21 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can get you several MFL


[04-Aug-24 09:21 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i could get you 15 i think


[04-Aug-24 09:21 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
at 115k based off of the sheet


[04-Aug-24 09:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
awesome yeah I'll take em 😄


[04-Aug-24 09:22 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ok great, ill add them to my buy list


[04-Aug-24 09:22 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ill send you the contract later to sell them to you


[04-Aug-24 09:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
FSEs are probably shortest in stock for me, I think I'd take QCRs just so I can make more FSEs personally


[04-Aug-24 09:23 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
QCR there at 11 spare in ANT right now


[04-Aug-24 09:23 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Based on his last numbers


[04-Aug-24 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah maybe I'd take like 5 🤷‍♂️


[04-Aug-24 09:43 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Sure!


[04-Aug-24 09:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
786k for LCB is a rip


[04-Aug-24 09:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Indeed, but if allows me to get the rest of the components I’m fine with it


[04-Aug-24 09:55 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Like I’m able to get the ships for resale because I’m taking whole ships off of his hand


[04-Aug-24 10:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
If you want to adjust UPF product prices now is the time. I think they have a bit too much margin on them compared to the other products

[04-Aug-24 02:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
At least its netting to a nice payday


[05-Aug-24 06:52 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[05-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay sounds good


[07-Aug-24 11:33 AM] sidepipe#0000
I was wondering if it might make sense to have a separate channel for ship building projects (I.e the orders) only - it seems like a lot of the projects get buried in the other channels


[07-Aug-24 11:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I was looking at Hal's project and it's way up there


[07-Aug-24 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
any channels we should purge?


[07-Aug-24 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
The list is pretty long


[07-Aug-24 11:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
#route-board ?


[07-Aug-24 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
Any planets we should consolidate?


[07-Aug-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't mind the planets,  it makes callouts easier


[07-Aug-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I didn't realize how high they were until I started making them.

[07-Aug-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I redid the external prices, brought them into line with evoV's price, generally a little higher than the GTU price


[07-Aug-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
This puts the external sale price at 5.8m, mostly trimmed off the CQM and BR1.


[07-Aug-24 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also updated my stock numbers


[07-Aug-24 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
And might set up the sheet so we can price out other ships, like a WCB, WCB upgrade, and our big fancy ships.


[07-Aug-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Insula can hopefully start providing LCBs and MSL. The LCB rate is pretty good from them.


[07-Aug-24 12:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
Are there any products that we’re short on after Churv left? Still trying to decide what to do with some of my spare permits 🙂


[07-Aug-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I struggle making the NOZ for FSEs, but we have 5 in stock. UPF products will depend mostly on Mr. Hal


[07-Aug-24 12:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have 37 NOZ right now


[07-Aug-24 12:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
HAL or Hal?

{Reactions}
👆 

[07-Aug-24 12:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
lol, will fix that


[07-Aug-24 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Biggest shortage I'm expecting is gonna be in the CHA > NOZ > FSE  chain. Ship kit parts tend to be slow too, even with Insula we might run short there.


[07-Aug-24 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will totally take some NOZ for FSEs, send em over wherever they are at whatever price you want


[07-Aug-24 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can make ACS pretty fast, so the rest of the FSE is easy for me


[07-Aug-24 12:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can send maybe 10, I think


[07-Aug-24 12:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
at 55k


[07-Aug-24 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
awesome, that'll help, thanks


[07-Aug-24 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think everything that is short is depending on ASM time


[07-Aug-24 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Your good candidates are, ship kit factory stuff, fancy shields, Just make a bunch of FET (needed for Bridges, and there's none on the CX)


[07-Aug-24 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Equal parts BOS and FAL for CHA -> NOZ chain


[07-Aug-24 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
need FET for AHP too


[07-Aug-24 12:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have hundreds of FAL and BOS though, so wouldn't focus on those


[07-Aug-24 12:25 PM] hernanduer#0000

[07-Aug-24 12:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
FET seems like a good candidate then - I’ll look around in prunplanner


[07-Aug-24 01:18 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
For individual ship sales Evov is looking for 6 mil usualy
I was able to get these prices since I bought 14 full ships off of him


[07-Aug-24 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay cool. Yeah when I spoke with him he was sort of basing his prices of ours somewhat. I did get a list of his price-per-component as a reference point


[07-Aug-24 01:19 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah his willing to go quite low to get these ships off of his hands


[07-Aug-24 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you know if he still has assorted stock?


[07-Aug-24 01:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
He is in the process of regrouping everything on Ant then he should give me an update to his stocks


[07-Aug-24 01:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can share it here once I hear from him


[07-Aug-24 01:21 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
For reference, he sold me the kits for 5.2 mil so there is a lot of profits to be made in repackaging his components under our name


[07-Aug-24 01:21 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Some components in particular, if we were to miss match his components with ours we might be able to lower the costs more


[07-Aug-24 01:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah exactly my thoughts. I have big oversupplies of LFE, MFE, SFE, and FFC.


[07-Aug-24 01:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Good to know, I might buy a few components off of your hands if it completes some ship kits


[07-Aug-24 01:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I still have people interested in at least 5-10 ships so I’m looking to repeat my ship flipping


[07-Aug-24 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Very nice 😄

[07-Aug-24 01:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
His prices fluctuate from quite good to horrible. As a package it’s good, you can see with the individual components if they are worth it to you


[07-Aug-24 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can fill some of those from my external ship building stock if you want to pay what I paid for them.


[07-Aug-24 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000

Jump damage is based on hyper drive utilization


[09-Aug-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
Charge damage actually, the jump damage is only modified by the plates and drones


[09-Aug-24 10:41 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What’s the reasoning behind fixing at 80%? I’m getting there and I’d really like to stretch it if at all possible


[09-Aug-24 10:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
Above 80% the damage doesn't impact your speed, below 80% you get a multiplier against your speed based on the % damage


[09-Aug-24 10:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
So you immediately go 20% slower


[09-Aug-24 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I didn’t even know that was a thing tbh


[09-Aug-24 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So I guess off I go to repair me ships


[09-Aug-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
What... What percent damage are they?


[09-Aug-24 02:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
60%

[09-Aug-24 03:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Could be worse


[09-Aug-24 03:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
when you fix them, does it goes back to 100% or it fixes certain amount?


[09-Aug-24 03:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
It goes to 100% but costs scale with current damage

since you can't buy 3.5 BHP, what points of % creates another item for fixing?


[09-Aug-24 03:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
accually nevermind I don't think that matters that much


[09-Aug-24 04:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
There are shelves you can plot out, but it's not super worth the hassle. There are also repair shelves for base materials, and an extra 5 afabs might make it worth the time to find those shelves


[09-Aug-24 04:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
Allocater made a bunch of charts a long time ago showing those repair shelves/cliffs


[09-Aug-24 04:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
Repair cost to buildings is linear with time since last repair, not damage %, so it's pretty easy to model the damage and see those shelves yourself


[09-Aug-24 04:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
Building reapair assistant is pretty good


[09-Aug-24 04:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
For ships, yeah it's not worth the hassle

Does anyone currently make an excess of CTF?


[09-Aug-24 05:06 PM] akyantor#0000
Still thinking about how I build to making AWH


[09-Aug-24 05:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am definitely not making excess 🫠


[09-Aug-24 05:10 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeh, that's what I'd suspect 😛


[09-Aug-24 05:11 PM] akyantor#0000
It's going to take some time for me to build up the additional supply chain for the CTF/TK. Will probably buy the TI/HE as they're more readily available.

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Aug-24 05:13 PM] akyantor#0000
I've prunplanned about two thirds of the materials for CTF/TK, so getting towards a clear plan.


[10-Aug-24 03:45 AM] akyantor#0000
I've prunplanned now the entire supply chain to get one HWP making AWH. What a mission, but at least know now how to start building towards it. Might drop the first base in the plan later this weekend. 🙂


[10-Aug-24 08:31 AM] timomurbekov#0000
Hey guys! How are you?


[10-Aug-24 08:31 AM] timomurbekov#0000
I want to upgrade one of my basic ships to 2000 t cargo bay ship

How much will cost to me all amount of stuff for this (except SSC)? Anyone provide all this stuff all together?

[10-Aug-24 08:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
Typically you don't want to upgrade to a LCB but instead to a WCB. That way you don't pay for a new CQM, which is very expensive


[10-Aug-24 08:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
If you want an LCB, you're better off building a new ship really

@hernanduer thanks great idea!


[10-Aug-24 11:10 AM] tuffyless#0000
System: ZV-307 - Antares I, where the CX is, is a Star Type: F.  
Does a Type F star warrant SRP's on a puddlejumper in that system?


[10-Aug-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, it's more useful in Ant 1 than most systems. It also depends how close you get to the star too, so Eos is gonna affect you more than Astraeus, butttttt you can transit the entire solar system, passing very close to the star, to get to a farther away planet


[10-Aug-24 01:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
And that second bit matters more for puddle jumpers than others


[10-Aug-24 01:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
Since for warp points you won't be crossing the system


[10-Aug-24 01:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
So any puddle jumper really I'd recommend SRP


[10-Aug-24 01:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
APT if you visit a single HSE planet, and AWH if the system is high meteorite


[10-Aug-24 01:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Thermals scale with atmosphere too, so not all HSE planets are equal, Astraeus is 3x worse than Agamemnon, but they're both HSE planets


[10-Aug-24 01:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Astraeus really has a very dense atmosphere, it's basically a frozen Venus


[10-Aug-24 01:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
ohh, so the Radiation Shielding lets the ship get closer to the sun with less damage.  nice


[10-Aug-24 01:26 PM] tuffyless#0000
I've started to make a sheet to compare different systems.

[10-Aug-24 01:29 PM] tuffyless#0000
I dont typically assign ships to the same route over and over.  
Whenever I need a ship to go somewhere, I find whatever ship is next available at the source and use it.
So with that being given, it would be best to give all the ship nearly all the buffs.


[10-Aug-24 01:30 PM] tuffyless#0000
But if you do assign the same ships to run the same routes over and over, then itd make sense to apply only the buffs needed, specific to the systems they traverse only.


[10-Aug-24 01:35 PM] tuffyless#0000
Wish we knew the low rad/high rad scale for Star Types.  F, K, M, G, etc


[12-Aug-24 03:44 PM] akyantor#0000
I've finally got around costing up getting the full supply chain setup for AWH (+24 a day), with some minor reconfiguration of my existing bfab/lfab production to fit it in. It's a lot more than I thought... 15m AIC at market prices for all the building materials without startup consumables. 😱 *A lot of that is the LAB/ASM/AML which are super expensive.*


[12-Aug-24 04:00 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, struggle to think of using a loan to do it, as it's quite uncertain how much demand there would be. Feels a bit risky. *Maybe just for the last few elements LAB/ASM/AML. * That said, the Malahat base payout would theoretically enable me to pay it back within 100 or so days, so maybe it's ok.


[12-Aug-24 04:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd be open to sponsoring some of the project - seems like more AWH is an important thing to have in the corp right now 🙂


[12-Aug-24 04:06 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm probably going to need to do the expansion in stages anyway, as I'll want to get production going on some bases earlier than others to ensure there's sufficient supply to keep bases running in later parts of the supply chain.


[12-Aug-24 04:06 PM] akyantor#0000
So it wouldn't be all in one go


[12-Aug-24 04:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could probably sponsor substantially more if it isn't in one go 😄


[12-Aug-24 04:08 PM] akyantor#0000
I'll start to think about the sequencing in more detail. I've kicked off the first bit, which is Demeter (for GRN, already done), followed by Halcyon (for C + HAL). As I'll need a lot more C for a bunch of stuff.


[12-Aug-24 04:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Next after that is probably a few more extraction planets, and Elon (for CL production).


[12-Aug-24 04:12 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm about to do HQ upgrades for the first 3 bases, so need to lock in the logical next 3. 🙂


[12-Aug-24 04:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Makes sense!


[12-Aug-24 04:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just let me know whenever you decide to do some expansions. I'm sitting on a good amount of cash, and I don't have the energy to figure out what bases to build next right now - so someone might as well use it 😄


[12-Aug-24 04:14 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, cool. Will let you know.


[12-Aug-24 05:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
Keep in mind you don't need to be entirely self contained, especially stuff like AL or FE, just buy on market

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Aug-24 02:32 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, the vast majority of the new bases are for materials that are thinly traded, or expensive (like C). There are some materials that I may have just bought, but often they're a somewhat cheap side effect of availability on a planet for the materials in the other categories.


[14-Aug-24 09:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have 213 APT, 170 AWH and 188 SRP, and 70 AHP if anyone wants to retrofit, you'll just need some more AHP

I upgraded this one a couple months ago, my Ant 1 puddlejumper, and it's dropped I think 2% in that time

and it's still on LHP


[15-Aug-24 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000

That’s pretty impressive. Especially since my poor Thalassa puddle jumper is getting close to 80% already 😄

FYI - I'm making good progress on my project to get a AWH pipeline going... completed the first couple of steps. I'd really like to be fully up in 3-4 weeks, but don't know how realistic that is. It'll take a bit of time to get the whole supply chain going.. that said should hopefully have the TK bit running hopefully next week or next. Then I'll start to focus on the CTF bit of the supply chain.

I think here's how I'm gonna manage internal sales of external ships. These are the options for the OOG standard 2k ship:

1) Buy all your parts from individuals at their in-corp price: Adds up to $4,563,800, with fuel, availability is unknown.

Archiel buys and holds ship components at a higher price for external sales.
2) External price is now 5,864,820 with fuel. This includes the markup passed to each component manufacturer, plus a rounding "commission markup" of $246,680. This makes the price of each component contract divisible by 1k. If we get enough ships in the backlog, I will pass some/all of this commission on to a person organizing a sale. This might be a whitelabeled, "direct from factory / dropshipped" ship sale, even managed by someone outside the corp, which allows us to move our ships without our names on it.

3) If you (an oog shareholder) want to buy an external ship from me, I will refund the commission markup, plus the markup on SFE, MFE, LFE and FFC. I can't refund other people's markups though. That's a $341,680 refund, making the net price 5,523,140, or 64k less if you don't want fuel

How much for the parts for 1 WCB and 1 the other cargo bay for hauling gasses?  I ate too many beans


[25-Aug-24 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
A VCB ship is gonna cost more than even the LCB 2k/2k, You'll have to plan one out though. I think they require a BR2 ( could be wrong though)


[25-Aug-24 01:29 PM] katinga#0000
BR1 on my BPT

I make those


[25-Aug-24 02:21 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The only gases for which VCB is really worthwhile are H, He and He3.  The others are all close enough to 1kg/m^3 that you would hit the weight limit on a VCB with less contents than could fit in the volume limit of an LCB


[25-Aug-24 03:09 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Contracts sent. I can take HYR on Heph in case you are producing it there


[25-Aug-24 03:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have a couple HYR available if he's out


[25-Aug-24 03:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
All cargo bays are 325k internally, outside it's whatever the CX is selling which is like 600k

Is this internal pricing just wondering if I should work towards next base or wcb kit


[26-Aug-24 01:40 AM] exeler#0000
It's probably better to go for more bases before more/better ships. Bases make money, ships don't (unless you're using them to trade across CXs or are super diligent about picking up shipping contracts). If you're not using all of your shipping capacity yet, there's no reason to upgrade it.


[26-Aug-24 09:35 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I thought my base would fill out on this POPR but I guess I was wrong 🤣

It’s more of a problem than I realised on planets further from the core. I built a base on Elon only to realise the poor had come out 20 hours earlier and only got a fraction of my desired workforce. 😦


[26-Aug-24 09:38 AM] akyantor#0000
Still chipping away at my plan for AWH… it’s feeling a little less insurmountable with 5 new bases deployed already, and one existing planet reconfigured.


[27-Aug-24 11:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Does anyone have LIS?


[27-Aug-24 11:15 AM] marat_sh#0000
we should probably set up MAG -> AWF -> WR -> LIS production

there is a small amount of MAG in ANT

I have 3 LIS you can send for on ANT. I don't make it very fast though, and usually I will use it myself

[27-Aug-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
you get 5 AWF at a time, so it's somethihng you just make 40 of then you are set for a few months


[27-Aug-24 11:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I used the two you gave me earlier  😊


[27-Aug-24 11:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000

I greatly underestimated the time with no experts and an almost full base 🥴

BR2 is 4 days and CQM is about 1 more day


[27-Aug-24 11:35 AM] marat_sh#0000
there is a small MAG on QJ-149 d. It can be used as CLI extractor mainly and some MAG from time to time when needed


[27-Aug-24 11:46 AM] melon164#0000
I have no LIS in atm, but I tend to make them in batches of 12 or so

what was Churvs price for RDLs?


[30-Aug-24 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are 600k on the CX


[30-Aug-24 01:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
did he have a corp price?


[30-Aug-24 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
i guess the sheet says 400...

[30-Aug-24 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
But seeing as I sold you the SRDs for 50k each


[30-Aug-24 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
and it takes 8 of them

uh lets do 550k each then


[30-Aug-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the mats were at least 530k each, and I thought those were good discounts on the mats so make sure you get decent money even in the corp cause they also take 5d of UPF time


[30-Aug-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is worth more than 20k I'm sure


[30-Aug-24 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
And as we know from Hern's math, SRDs at 50k aren't profitable either lol


[30-Aug-24 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
which makes me think the RDLs should be like 800k easy


[30-Aug-24 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Churv is the only one who has them on the CX though


[30-Aug-24 01:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well


[30-Aug-24 01:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
if we buy them and take them off the CX...


[30-Aug-24 02:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
honestly maybe not a bad idea just given the prices


[31-Aug-24 01:44 AM] melon164#0000
Can I get someone with a SKF to build me a WCB and a MSL?  I have all the materials

[08-Sep-24 03:49 PM] akyantor#0000
Is anyone regularly making SRP? I'm thinking about perhaps branching out to make that too after AWH, edge closer to being able to provide a package of protection materials together for upgrades.


[08-Sep-24 03:50 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm probably a week or two from having the AWH pipeline up and running, but thinking about what the next logical step may be for me to help with ship building.


[09-Sep-24 04:11 AM] melon164#0000
I make SRP occasionally, because I have a TA source


[09-Sep-24 04:11 AM] melon164#0000
It's incredibly low volume


[09-Sep-24 07:57 AM] akyantor#0000

On the final straight for getting mass AWH production up and running... really just waiting now for the popr on Griffonstone (4 days) to cycle so I can build up stock of TCL, get the KV/TK flowing, and then essentially there. If I were to guess I'm probably a week and a half away.

I'll buy the NOZ, LFP, ATP. Also if you have any fuel rods of either type I'd take those too. No specific ideas about the prices, so whatever you want for em.

I currently have 7 OOG 2k/2k ships for sale. I'm offering them internally before posting them externally. 

Price is now 5,864,820 with fuel

For internal sales: I will refund the commission markup, plus the markup on SFE, MFE, LFE and FFC. I can't refund other people's markups though. That's a $341,680 refund, making the net price 5,523,140, or 64k less if you don't want fuel.

700k for RDLs is probably fine

How many does he need? (I can check later)

depends on how much you wanna spend

WCB itself is not that expansive

but it costs a bit


[12-Oct-24 12:36 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
I don't know how to do the calculation for at what point they because economical in preventing the wear on your ship, so I guess I'll hold off on that

Is the FTL engine worth upgrading?


[12-Oct-24 12:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
well... everything worth upgrading... it just costs money


[12-Oct-24 12:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
most for your $ you get from cargo upgrade and light weight hauls


[12-Oct-24 03:19 AM] melon164#0000
From your starter ship, to upgrade to WCB you just need the bay itself and a couple of emitters, so pretty cheap (~500k).  At the same time you can also upgrade your FTL fuel bay from SFL to MFL for no extra emitters (because it puts back in the emitters it was going to take out), which increases your FTL fuel capacity a lot.  Swapping the BHP hull plates for LHP is also considered worthwhile (the LHPs degrade faster than BHP, but they're 'more cheaper' so you still save money overall).  Upgrading the FTL engine requires you to upgrade your bridge, so throwing away a perfectly good 900k BR1 to add a 1-million BR2 (equally switching to LCB requires swapping the crew quarters), so at that point you're better off thinking about building a new ship from scratch, as you're paying half the cost of one for the upgrade anyway.

There's definitely an uptick of folks interested in shields for their ships. There have been at least three different buyers active on AWH at ANT over the last week or so.


[13-Oct-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
lowstrife alone has upped his order to more than 1000 units. 😱

[13-Oct-24 11:42 AM] akyantor#0000
He's got a monster order for ATP too... but looking at the LEAD board barely anyone is making any... so tempted to do a spot of reconfiguration to be able to make equal amounts of ATP/AWH, which would give us a steady supply of at least 2 of 3 shield types.


[13-Oct-24 11:42 AM] akyantor#0000
I think with two additional planets I can consistently make ~25 a day of both


[13-Oct-24 11:42 AM] akyantor#0000
And given the buy orders for AWH should have plenty of money to pay for the expansion


[13-Oct-24 11:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
How's the income per permit with those prices he has on the CX?


[13-Oct-24 11:57 AM] akyantor#0000
My somewhat crude cost base calculator has a very healthy margin at that price (albeit not smart enough to include the base repair costs). I could probably afford the cost to be a chunk lower and still be making good money. *Then the whole production chain is heavily vertically integrated.*

There's definitely a risk of market saturation, particularly if other shield products aren't available in the same volume.


[13-Oct-24 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since Akyan is making a ton of AWH, you might want to grab one of the other shield types, assuming they fit okay into your production chain

Does anyone regularly have free SKF time? If so, I would like to organize something to get more LCBs running. And if everyone's SKF is full, I might end up doing one myself


[03-Nov-24 10:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
unless someone wants to convert (or add) their deimos / vulcan base to make AST


[03-Nov-24 11:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I could maybe redo Deimos


[04-Nov-24 12:20 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
I have space for a free skf on vulcan


[04-Nov-24 03:57 AM] melon164#0000
I have a mostly-idle SKF on Deimos.  They're almost impossible to keep supplied, in my experience, you need something like ten bases worth of intermediates to run LCB/WCB full time

@shrewdsun_88540 I have a BR2 at ANT if you need, saw your post in UFO


[04-Nov-24 03:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That would be interesting. Still looking up the numbers but im looking at designs for quick smaller trade ship for CX-CX


[04-Nov-24 03:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
hopefully, i want a fleet of up to 10 of those. Do you actively produce them or is it just stock?

[04-Nov-24 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I bet @.urpalhal  could turn out a lot of them pretty quickly if we can supply him the mats


[04-Nov-24 04:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I can crank out about 2 BR/CQ pairs per day if I never run out of materials


[04-Nov-24 04:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Thanks guys. Ill look into and give it a think. Still trying to figure out my next venture and trade might be fun

OH I am making about 30 FET and AST /d


[04-Nov-24 09:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I don't use AST and I can sell my excess FET 🙂


[04-Nov-24 09:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I could add some WAL into the mix too


[04-Nov-24 09:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and then it would be 20/d for all three


[04-Nov-24 09:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can keep buying your FET/FAL, but I think the more AST I can get I will be able to feed them to melon for LCBs, which is what's missing on the next 10 ships


[04-Nov-24 10:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I dropped FAL bc I have not used enough it so I figured I could add AST and WAL

does it count as building a new ship?

[05-Nov-24 08:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can subtract out the parts that aren't needed for the upgrade


[05-Nov-24 08:54 PM] archielvahr#0000

[05-Nov-24 08:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
from starting one


[05-Nov-24 08:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah probably like 2 mil or something, especially if you drop the 700k of AWH

[06-Nov-24 03:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
If it's a starter ship I would leave it alone, gonna be so much you might as well just buy a new ship


[06-Nov-24 03:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
Only thing to do with starter ships is WCB upgrade, which can include MFL and MSL and LHP


[06-Nov-24 03:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
You want to avoid needing a new crew quarters or LFE

@archielvahr how is it possible to recognize system or route specifics (asteroids belts, etc.) to understand the right type of shields?


[07-Nov-24 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
@hernanduer  might know better. The raw numbers are in the SYSI buffer, but I'm not sure how to read them. I think generally you will need to do blueprint test flights and compare damage numbers. it is pretty manual

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[07-Nov-24 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it makes most sense to do that optimization when you have a STL only ship, then it stays in a single system the whole time... and you can optimize for that system


[07-Nov-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
if meteoroid density > 2, AWH are pretty good. If the planet requires HSE, then you want APTs. If the stars are frequently A/B/O class, then you also want SRPs

[07-Nov-24 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
this is right though, you're best just getting all shields if the ship is not on a set route


[07-Nov-24 11:00 AM] timomurbekov#0000
@archielvahrthanks!


[08-Nov-24 11:01 AM] akyantor#0000
Is there a reason why the 2k all shields ship in the corp sheet uses a HYR rather than QCR?


[08-Nov-24 11:15 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm wondering if it is just a preference thing or not?


[08-Nov-24 11:15 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm thinking of building my next ship, so need to make some decisions. 🙂


[08-Nov-24 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I believe the HYRs reduce wear. Because they run at a lower percentage. THere are a few discussions about it

[08-Nov-24 11:17 AM] akyantor#0000
Interesting


[08-Nov-24 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
And since all the shields and AHP and HYRs essentially have a multiplicative effect on reducing the wear, there's the incentive to do all of them in order to get the repair cost down, even if the mats are more expensive


[08-Nov-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's right playing around with the test flight tool you can knock down the reaction a lot and even if you're still a bit faster the damage is noticably lower.


[08-Nov-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess you'd have to get into the habit of knocking the power down to 20% all the time 😛


[08-Nov-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
And I guess you have the side benefit that if you ever want to blast the engines to get somewhere quick you have that option too.


[08-Nov-24 11:25 AM] akyantor#0000
I think I'm sold... will be an expensive ship, albeit one that I won't have to repair all that often. 😛

9.3m AIC at corp prices. 😮 Though I'd be able to supply my own AWH/AHP


[08-Nov-24 11:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Gotta spend it on somethin'!


[08-Nov-24 11:27 AM] akyantor#0000
It's also got a Large STL tank... not sure I'd ever need to carry that much SF


[08-Nov-24 11:27 AM] akyantor#0000
8000 is a crap load of SF


[08-Nov-24 11:28 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, I see it doesn't change the crew quarters or command bridge... but does reduce the other parts. I'd be tempted to downgrade the STL tank to medium, just to save a little bit there.


[08-Nov-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's probably not super useful


[08-Nov-24 11:29 AM] akyantor#0000
I can't think of many times where 3500 of SF would be insufficient even for multiple trips


[08-Nov-24 11:30 AM] akyantor#0000
This is the setup... may start to trickle buy parts to work towards it. I'd ideally like to upgrade my other LCB ships at some point so they're matching configurations.

👆 Looks like there's a lot less SRP/APT production. Do we need a more steady production to enable fully kitted out ships?


[08-Nov-24 11:41 AM] akyantor#0000
Indeed, looking at the current 7 day leader boards the only 100 APT was made in the last week. Looks like Melon/Archiel made non-trivial amounts of SRP though.


[08-Nov-24 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000

I've been occasionally sending TAI to Hern, so assume he still can make more SRP when needed too.


[08-Nov-24 11:55 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm going to try to keep 120 AWH / AHP on hand from now on out, so there's always supply available for corp orders. I'm a bit more liquid again after the monster expansion to get AWH up and running in a vertically integrated fashion. 😛


[08-Nov-24 03:25 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm going to make a start building that ship, as I need something better suited to get out to Nyx. I want to setup a Chem/Lab base there. 🙂


[08-Nov-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd guess it'll take a while to gather up the necessary parts anyway.


[08-Nov-24 08:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have a lot of SRP especially since lowstrife isn't buying any


[08-Nov-24 08:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
And I do agree that LSL are really too much fuel, MSL are completely sufficient for any use

🚨 🚀 🚨 SPACESHIP SALE 🚨 🚀 🚨
 
I will soon have about 8 OOG 2k/2k ships for sale. These are the LHP ones. I'm offering them internally before posting them externally. 

Price is now 5,786,820 with fuel.

For internal sales: I will refund the commission markup, plus the markup on SFE, MFE, LFE and FFC. I can't refund other people's markups though. That's a $341,680 refund, making the net price 5,445,140, or 64k less if you don't want fuel.

[26-Nov-24 07:34 PM] evov#0000
I think demand for ships has been increasing. There was a time I had 20+ ships in stock and would do discounts for bulk sales. I'm currently in the process of re-calling a lot of stock I sent to other CX's for CX sales just to maintain a healthy supply people ordering full ships.


[26-Nov-24 07:48 PM] max.kalina#0000
Good morning! As I skip last year's in game, we still need to buy ship parts or we could buy the whole ship from other players?


[26-Nov-24 07:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
You can buy ship parts from us, and you can also buy entire ships from OOG and many other fine shipbuilders (including EvoV 🙂 )


[26-Nov-24 07:52 PM] max.kalina#0000
Wow! That's a new information for me! Thanks!


[26-Nov-24 07:56 PM] evov#0000
I might be missing someone, but I believe OOG, myself, and Rise are the main ship builders in the region.


[26-Nov-24 08:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can see this if you want ships from me with the corp discount https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/944644507050323968/1309294438631211128


[27-Nov-24 10:32 AM] katinga#0000
Do you have a "some assembly required" kit for WCB?


[27-Nov-24 10:44 AM] exeler#0000
I think you still need to buy the pieces individually from players, there's no mechanism in game yet for getting multiple goods at a time from a single contract. 

However, as stated already many players do offer kits all together. So you can buy a whole ship's worth of parts at once. Just in game it'll be a contract for each type of part.


[27-Nov-24 10:46 AM] katinga#0000
Why is there no option for fuzzy dice or dancing hula girl for the cockpits?  lol

[27-Nov-24 10:48 AM] katinga#0000
main downside to Rise these days is that he takes forever to fill a contract.  You could be waiting weeks on parts


[27-Nov-24 10:52 AM] evov#0000
Yea, there's a trade off between price and availability generally.  Crafstman is at one end of the scale being super cheap, but booked out till next year some time. I feel like I'm at the other end of the scale, more expensive but no-one I've sold to has had to wait more than a couple of days. Everyone else sits somewhere between those 2 ends of the spectrum I think.

Have we ever sold a WCB ship externally before? I had someone asking me if OOG sold them


[29-Nov-24 09:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think the only sellers right now are Craftsman and Rise, and from what I understand Rise's waitlist is suuuuper long right now


[29-Nov-24 09:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Not in the last few years at least. I don't have a contract page set up for them like I do the 2k ship


[29-Nov-24 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
Would folks be okay with me selling evayoo a WCB ship as a one-off? I can wrangle the parts and pass the markup on to the people selling me the parts


[29-Nov-24 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds good to me. I probably have all the parts. I think the ship building page shows both the internal and external sales price for all the common parts


[29-Nov-24 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Let me know if something on that sheet doesn't make sense, since it's not super well explained there


[29-Nov-24 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also.. I miiight have all the parts on Heph. Column `W` is now pulling right from my FIO inventory on Heph


[29-Nov-24 10:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
~~column U~~ Cell U4 is the external sale price once you've chosen your desired blueprint in A2?


[29-Nov-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
wanna check that before I quote a price 😄


[29-Nov-24 10:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah so...


[29-Nov-24 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
FSE internal price is 650,000. If I buy one from a corpmate for external sales, I pay 825,000 (col R)


[29-Nov-24 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then when I make a whole-ship comission, I want to hit the target price on AA:42, so those columns down there calculate the per item markup


[29-Nov-24 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
And that's what generates the number in Col U, and u4 is the sum of those

[29-Nov-24 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
The markup calculations have a lot of rounding to make nice even numbers


[29-Nov-24 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
so the final cost there of the FSE is 825k+13k = 838k


[29-Nov-24 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
if you swap the "Selected Ship" the markup calc barfs and you get silly numbers at the moment


[29-Nov-24 10:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
(cause it will try to markup the WCB up to 5,900,000)


[29-Nov-24 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
The original sales commission was around 200k, but now it's 346k cause some prices changed a while ago


[29-Nov-24 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
so I guess aim for that 🤷‍♂️


[29-Nov-24 10:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
oh wpw


[29-Nov-24 10:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
did not notice the markup for the WCB was 2m 😄


[29-Nov-24 10:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr is the 'unrounded target price' the right thing to change for this?


[29-Nov-24 10:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
(if I back up the original value of 5.9M somewhere :P)


[29-Nov-24 10:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay yeah I think that's better.


[29-Nov-24 10:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
Would be nice to fill out the external sale price for everything we might sell, just making up numbers basically for them


[29-Nov-24 10:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you sell fuel, I think the fuel prices might be low, they should just match the cx


[29-Nov-24 10:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
Or maybe they don't care about fuel


[29-Nov-24 10:33 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'll see what evayoo thinks


[29-Nov-24 10:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
The "New WCB" has an STS because I was matching Katinga's design


[29-Nov-24 10:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
you could leave that off

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
will probably just quote for a ship minus CQS and STS then


[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
and luckily all the markup goes to the other parts anyway 😄


[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also the only reason the whole markup thing is complicated is that I wanted numbers divisible by 1000 for the prices, so I apologize for the weirdness 😄


[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
yup


[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
`Rounded Item Markup    11,000`


[29-Nov-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's really the "cost per click" of sending contracts


[29-Nov-24 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
which I think is totally reasonable given how much a pain it is to send them all 😆


[29-Nov-24 10:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
so there is a method to this madness 😛


[29-Nov-24 10:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
yep, works for me - I'd be happy to forgo the click markup since I'm just doing it once, but it's better to leave it in so pricing is consistent if we ever sell another WCB

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Nov-24 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I can fix the ship definitions so they have a price on them too in the sheet


[29-Nov-24 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Or maybe just sent the contract markup and go with that


[29-Nov-24 10:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
could you take a peek at the 'final price' in AD31 for a ship without CQS and STS?


[29-Nov-24 10:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
just to make sure I've got the right numbers 😅


[29-Nov-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Looks good to me!


[29-Nov-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah when we did the price drop to 5.9m (which made a huge difference in sales compared to 6.28m), it was nice to have that markup tool, but it's still a little weird. And price changes mean redoing contracts so that's the annoying part


[29-Nov-24 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll have to think on it. I think, for example, the FSE should have the same price to matter what ship it's going into


[29-Nov-24 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
Since I've been thinking about setting up for sales (internal and external) of shielded ships too


[29-Nov-24 10:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, that way you at least have consistent prices for all the purchases internally when selling externally


[29-Nov-24 10:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
I could reuse some contracts while redoing new screens for each ship, heh


[29-Nov-24 10:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
hmm


[29-Nov-24 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
what if we keep the internal 'producer' markup the same and bury the markup for the seller in the individual cargo bays?


[29-Nov-24 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
since you'll only ever use one per ship


[29-Nov-24 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the reason I wanted to spread them evenly (or price proportionally would be even better, but rounding is harder).. is because of this situation:

I sent someone all 18 ship contracts, they accept all of them except the cargo bay, then they buy the cargo bay elsewhere


[29-Nov-24 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
so then they get no markup essentially


[29-Nov-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
That feels kind of paranoid for prun


[29-Nov-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
🤷‍♂️


[29-Nov-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also debated selling everything for 1 AIC then doing the sum price in one contract too. Which is that same problem on steroids


[29-Nov-24 10:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
ah yeah, good point


[29-Nov-24 02:42 PM] evov#0000
I just do lump sum pricing for ships now. I had a similar issue when I started. I'd break it down into individual prices. And people would try to moneyball that stuff and just buy from me the parts that I had marked as cheaper than the CX.

If people want induvial parts - I'll sell them on the CX at CX rates. 

To save on the time/effort of drawing up contracts...I only do 3 options for people. All of them delivered to heph with full tanks. If they want something different, they can see someone different about buying a ship (like you guys, or Rise, or the GTU lads etc)

[29-Nov-24 02:44 PM] evov#0000
All of my contracts just have the payment portion on a single item, with the rest of the items priced at 1 AIC. Haven't had any issues yet thankfully.


[29-Nov-24 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh interesting, good to know that.


[29-Nov-24 02:45 PM] melon164#0000
I used to do that too


[29-Nov-24 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
It sounds like the same reason why I only offer a single ship


[29-Nov-24 02:45 PM] melon164#0000
Most people preferred it


[29-Nov-24 02:46 PM] melon164#0000
Sometimes if people wanted to pay in instalments they would pick arbitrary items to split the cost over


[29-Nov-24 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've had two or three where I will send them a loan and then they spend it on the ship. That is a nice option since the loans make that easy. I don't do it too often because ships don't directly generate revenue so it can be hard to know if they are going to make it back


[29-Nov-24 02:49 PM] evov#0000
Upside - it makes it very simple and clear for both sides to know that the price is correct - without having to add up the bits and pieces.

The way I looked at it - was if someone wants to accept the ship parts and not pay for them and get listed as a pirate - there's nothing you can really do to stop it.

It seemed like a fairly silly concept that if they accept all the 1 AIC parts, and decline the 6.2mil part - that somehow they wouldn't get listed as a pirate. I'm highly confident that the community would view them as a pirate if they did that. Technically following the in game rules - but they'll struggle to ever buy a complete ship from anyone else in the game again.


[29-Nov-24 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah good point, for sure


[30-Nov-24 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000

As with most great power conflicts, the region with the most ships, and ship producing capacity, has an undeniable advantage. So the fires of Antarean industrial might must burn with the ever growing threat of conflict in the back of our minds.

With this in mind, I've started to increase production capacity for some of the . . . less available . .  parts needed for ship production. Example ->

Got all those, the CQL is landing in ~3 hr


[12-Dec-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
FYI - pretty much no demand for AWH on the market. I’ve posted stock at 8k a unit on ANT if anyone is interested.


[12-Dec-24 04:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, probably good to support swapping to HMS as necessary


[17-Dec-24 11:54 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I will have spare SPF capacity soon if anyone wants anything produced


[18-Dec-24 07:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
How much for 1 HYR?


[18-Dec-24 07:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have a couple sitting around

## 🚨 🚀 🚨 SPACESHIP SALE 🚨 🚀 🚨
 
I have `5` OOG 2k/2k ships for sale. These are the LHP ones. I'm offering them internally before posting them externally. 

External price: $5,786,820.
Internal Price: $5,445,140

For internal sales: I will refund the commission markup, plus the markup on SFE, MFE, LFE and FFC. I can't refund other people's markups though. That's a $341,680 refund, making the net price $5,445,140, or 64k less if you don't want fuel.


[22-Dec-24 05:47 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I'll buy 2 of those. 🚀 🚀

When are they giving us bigger ships?

definitely a couple months away, I think. Since they aren't announced and aren't on the test server yet!

[28-Dec-24 11:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah they said they were doing it in the livestream, in response to a question


[28-Dec-24 11:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
so they kinda "leaked" it themselves.  Since we were suspecting one a while ago, and they confirmed it. but they haven't put it in writing. I'm sure it's coming, it's just very early


[30-Dec-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will probably bump the OOG external ships up from 5,786,820 to 5,990,000 and tweak the fuel prices too

I have 40 ZR in stock, who can I rope into making MFLs? Do you have SKF time, @timomurbekov ?

And @melon164  where should I pick those up?


[01-Jan-25 11:59 AM] melon164#0000
My SKF on Deimos finishes the last LCB in 2h; I'm bringing over 100 ZR for MFLs thereafter.  If you have the ZR on Deimos I could start prety much straight away


[01-Jan-25 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, it's on ANT right now


[01-Jan-25 12:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll bring it anyway cause I think Timur's are there too


[01-Jan-25 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000

cuz Hernanduer need 3weeks to produce 1HTE.
So, I would like to change to long-term contract.


[05-Jan-25 09:59 AM] martin1194#0000
If the price too low, I can do 3250k ea. : P

How much would this bill of materials cost? This would be for a very fast TCB ship.

Good day everyone!
Whats happend with old ship parts after upgrade of ship? They just dissapear? I remember that it was saying somewhere that old parts could be reused for future ships. Am I wrong?


[09-Jan-25 08:13 AM] melon164#0000
> Am I wrong? 
Unfortunately yes


[09-Jan-25 08:14 AM] melon164#0000
Old parts disappear


[09-Jan-25 08:14 AM] melon164#0000
Otherwise everyone could "upgrade" their starter ships to rust-bucket puddle jumpers and liberate millions in valuable parts


[09-Jan-25 08:15 AM] melon164#0000
although that could totally have been solved with a special-case for starter ships like the CMK is for starter base 🤷


[09-Jan-25 12:51 PM] max.kalina#0000
Thanks for reply! I remember around 2 or 3 years ago there was an announcement from Martin (or Molp) about this option, maybe they discard this from backlog. Also they talked about whole ship sell, except 2 basic ships.


[09-Jan-25 01:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
`2 or 3 years ago` So quite recently 😆


[11-Jan-25 05:26 PM] akyantor#0000
I had my third purchase of AWH from the CX. It's not exactly a thriving market, but a few people at least trying out shielded ships.

I have three BR1 at ANT


[21-Jan-25 01:57 AM] evov#0000
I go back and forth on the idea of selling individual parts for ships vs selling whole ships. Sometimes it's nice to sell individual parts on the CX for quick cash injections (especially if the price is extra juicy). But in general, I feel it makes the most sense to just sell full ships, since that's the endpoint of all the ship parts typically.


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think there's people who are willing to buy a complete ship but not willing to buy parts


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also I think a lot of people just don't want to mess with the ship designer, and have a design sent to them


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sending a contract for these 😄


[21-Jan-25 11:03 AM] katinga#0000
I've done both.  I do keep hull plates and stuff in stock for repairs


[22-Jan-25 05:41 AM] martin1194#0000
Is that quick charge FTP engine not good?


[22-Jan-25 05:41 AM] martin1194#0000
I can not think any benfit about Quick-Charge Engine. : /


[22-Jan-25 05:42 AM] mrsmith33#0000
All FTL engines have the same efficiency, so the only negative of more powerful FTL engines is higher price.


[22-Jan-25 05:42 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm using HYRs everywhere


[22-Jan-25 06:26 AM] martin1194#0000
So, the only benfit is cheaper. :/


[22-Jan-25 08:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
Which doesn't really matter in a game that goes on and on


[22-Jan-25 08:14 AM] martin1194#0000
Cuz I have some ships still using Quick-charge, thinking on replace it to Hyper.


[22-Jan-25 08:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
Eh best to just make a new ship since you have to replace almost every part anyway if you upgrade them


[22-Jan-25 09:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ship damage from FTL flight is proportional to the % of the reactor that is being used. So if you put on a faster FTL drive and turn it down, you can take substantially less damage and get there in the same time. Like half the damage.


[23-Jan-25 12:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
2 days until the last BR1 is going to be done

{Reactions}
👍 

[23-Jan-25 11:10 PM] evov#0000
I haven't really been keeping an eye on the CX. But if there is legitimately a shortage of BR1's getting around. I might be able address that issue. Got a batch of 20 cooking now.

And a bunch of MFK 🙂
Thanks so much!

## 🚨 🚀 🚨 SPACESHIP SALE 🚨 🚀 🚨

I have `6` OOG 2k/2k ships for sale. These are the LHP ones. I'm offering them internally before posting them externally. 

External price: $5,786,820.
Internal Price: $5,445,140

For internal sales: I will refund the commission markup, plus the markup on SFE, MFE, LFE and FFC. I can't refund other people's markups though. That's a $341,680 refund, making the net price $5,445,140, or 64k less if you don't want fuel.


[27-Jan-25 11:33 AM] archielvahr#0000

wcb ships are also useful


[27-Jan-25 11:41 AM] katinga#0000
oh and I don't need fuel.  i can move some from ANT


[27-Jan-25 11:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
ah okay great, I canceled the fuel ones. Saves me some hassle 😅


[27-Jan-25 11:42 AM] katinga#0000
I still need to make a gas hauler for my H production


[27-Jan-25 11:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I thought about adding one to my fleet, but I think for flexibility and price reasons, I'm just gonna use two LCBs


[27-Jan-25 12:12 PM] akyantor#0000
If you're interested in supply, I'm looking to rebalance my production to make equal amounts of AWH/SRP/ATP/AHP at more modest volumes than my supercharged rate for AWH/SRP. *My idea was to have a steady supply of all four to support making kits, but could contribute to a corp branded effort.*  If you already have a good supply of APT, then I could leave things as they are and supply more of AHP/SRP/AWH. 🙂

[27-Jan-25 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly I'm short on LFL / LSL. Although we could shrink the fuel tanks perhaps.


[27-Jan-25 12:20 PM] akyantor#0000
If I make the transition I'm planning then I'd be able to help out with LSL, in future. As I'll have excess AST/FET that I'd planned to find a way to turn into ship parts.

[28-Jan-25 08:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Since it's got so many plates on it, going from LHP to advanced makes it a lot heavier


[28-Jan-25 08:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
someone will have to do some theory crafting on that


[28-Jan-25 08:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, so... let's shift all our Crew quarter construction to CQL for a bit.


[28-Jan-25 08:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
If I get 5 CQL and 6 HCBs and a tiny bit more LHP.. I can build 6 of these things

5k ships are essentially faster than 2k. I almost can ship stuff in 12hr, like with 2k ship, but if I increase time to 24hr the fuel consumption will be lower than with 2k ship on 12hr route, but 2.5 time more goods can delivered, so either way it is cheaper/faster to use 5k ships

I have 99 WAL on ANT and 60 on Deimos. Happy to consolidate my scraps to someone who has the rest to make the HCBs. I imagine if we all pool our leftovers, we've got a couple HCBs laying around.

I'll probably make myself like, 3 of them first. Then I'll start selling them I think.


[28-Jan-25 10:31 AM] evov#0000
These will be my Viking Ships. I will load them up with thousands of IDC's and CBL's - send them off to foreign CX's. Sell the MM stuff to get local heathen currency and then loot and pillage their CX... load up the 5k ships and bring the bounty back to ANT.

I just wanna ship lots of water 😄


[28-Jan-25 10:33 AM] sidepipe#0000

realbandit has been doing a ton of HCB test flights and there are some real oddities with the damage numbers


[28-Jan-25 01:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
5k ships with QCRs take less damage than a 2k ship with a QCR using the same fuel cost


[28-Jan-25 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's because the 5ks have a lot more emitters, so the reactor usage is actually lower

and half a thousand W, so... should be able to crank one of these out in a week

@martin1194 speaking of your HTEs, this last one went a lot faster than I expected and will be done in a few days


[29-Jan-25 12:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think I rebalanced ATPs to meet it, but I don't remember 😅

I have a new ship that's not started building yet... do I wait until I get a HCB. 😛


[31-Jan-25 11:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd have to scrounge up some additional emitters. It's mighty tempting


[31-Jan-25 12:35 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm only building 5Ks now


[31-Jan-25 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have parts for a lot of 2k/2ks, and I have all the parts for a few 5k ships, minus the HCB


[31-Jan-25 02:11 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I'm going to switch strategy, go for the 5k ship. 😛


[31-Jan-25 03:27 PM] evov#0000
Not sure about the interaction between 5k ships and gateways. But even without the gateway issue, I think there's still a lot of good reasons to keep using 2k ships in plenty of scenarios.


[31-Jan-25 03:28 PM] evov#0000
I think people will want 5k ships now because they're new. But I don't think they're the best choice for all shipping tasks.


[31-Jan-25 03:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I think they'll be a good option in amongst other options.


[31-Jan-25 03:32 PM] akyantor#0000
I've already 2 WCB, 3 LCB (2 shielded up). So a 5k one would be a nice option for certain runs.


[31-Jan-25 04:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think they are inconveniently large for most of my runs. Like it would be a big challenge to fill them in both directions


[31-Jan-25 04:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will rope someone into moving GWS with them though 😄


[31-Jan-25 04:16 PM] akyantor#0000
In playing around with the test too it didn't seem like the flight time or fuel usage was all that different to a 2k ship, but there are quite a few runs I do know when it might be handy. AHP for example is pretty heavy... or doing TI runs.


[31-Jan-25 04:16 PM] akyantor#0000
I could travel a lot less frequently to 2-3 bases if I had at least one 5k ship on the go

Does anyone have a link to a resource on ship degradation formulas? Meaning how the "repair cost" is calculated from the "condition" percentage?


[01-Feb-25 05:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
It changed recently if the ship has shields. I think @hernanduer  might know. But I'm not sure if it's well documented anywhere

any1 can make these new HCB yet? price? how long to produce? i want to buy these if any1 can do it


[02-Feb-25 03:50 AM] mrsmith33#0000
It is limited by WAL production


[02-Feb-25 03:54 AM] evov#0000
In the longish term - I'm looking at selling HCB ships for about 11mil. At the moment, while there are buy orders up for WAL at 10k/u - price is more like 14mil imo


[02-Feb-25 04:00 AM] evov#0000
Rate of production - I think I'll be doing about 2 per week.


[02-Feb-25 04:00 AM] _bojidar#0000
is it like that?

how does  a "standard" 2k2k fit look like?

I think so. But... LHP instead of BHP. This is what I'll be offering.

LHP is -10% damage reduction... solets replace these and i can order 5 ships as a start. if more people can do it will order more


[02-Feb-25 04:07 AM] _bojidar#0000
i need like 20 of these initially


[02-Feb-25 04:08 AM] _bojidar#0000
btw there is upgrade on 2/2 to 5/5 or its not possible or may be not worth it


[02-Feb-25 04:08 AM] _bojidar#0000
?


[02-Feb-25 04:10 AM] evov#0000
Not sure. But since WAL (and hence the HCB's) are the limting factor, + the price of the ship, I suspect most people will be adding to an already well established fleet of ships rather than looking to upgrade.


[02-Feb-25 04:13 AM] evov#0000
No. I don't sell stuff in advance. I only sell stuff I have. And right now... I have zero.


[02-Feb-25 04:14 AM] evov#0000
First one in a few days I think. Probably a week or so untill I'm pushing out 2+ per week though.


[02-Feb-25 04:15 AM] evov#0000
But like I was saying - right now, because someone is buying WAL at 10k / unit - it puts the price much higher. Because... why turn wal into HCB's and selling them when I could make heaps more just filling the buy orders right?


[02-Feb-25 04:17 AM] evov#0000
In the medium term though, when things settle down and they're no longer a "new novelty" type thing... I suspect 11mil is where the steady state price will be. And yea, I'm certain there's plenty of people that will make / supply them for you.

[02-Feb-25 08:22 AM] evov#0000
I think there's still some open question marks around the gateway network that will be pretty impactful on 2k2k vs 5k5k ships and their relative strengths. Ultimately, I think they'll both have use cases where each one is optimal... but the % of circumstances might change.


[02-Feb-25 08:29 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'd imagine that gateways that permit 5k ships will be as little rarer than those that will support 2k ones.


[02-Feb-25 08:35 AM] evov#0000
Depends how the system gets designed. Nothing's actually been built yet, so there's plenty of time to modify plans.


[02-Feb-25 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
There are some designs out there for gateway systems that support 5k ships, but they have shorter jumps. In geneal (especially around ANT space) that means increasing the gateway count by 50%, and also more shorter jumps mean the gateways become slower for everyone


[02-Feb-25 01:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
5 OOG standards left. I will give it another day or two and then make them publically available


[02-Feb-25 04:06 PM] tyrandia#0000

4 left 🙂


[03-Feb-25 12:01 AM] evov#0000
The tradeoffs as I see them - 
On the ANT - BEN route

A. Limit it to 2k ships - but have full gateway coverage the whole way (making STL ships able to do CX-CX)
B. Have a 1 system gap in the middle, allowing 5k5k ships (making 5k5k ships able to do CX-CX, albeit with a 1 system FTL jump in the middle)

On the ANT - HRT route

A. Use the previously discussed placement at IA-151, limit the HRT side of the link to 2k2k ships.
B. Move the mid point to IA-158 - allows both links to be <20 and able to support 5k5k ships.

[03-Feb-25 12:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hm yeah leaving a gap is an interesting idea. If a ship goes through two gates in the same orbit, they just need to do the re-align step, which is supposed to be really short. I suppose if there's a jump that means an FTL flight plus a STL approach


[03-Feb-25 12:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really know how that compares to adding a third gate , which would be overkill for that situation. but it would probably be Heph <-> Antares V <-> Etherwind <-> BEN


[03-Feb-25 12:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
HRTs with warp vs. STL ships is interesting, no idea how those two balance


[03-Feb-25 12:08 AM] evov#0000
Yea, it counts out STL only flight between ANT and BEN .... but.... If I look forward 6-12months and ask myself if there will be more STL only ships wanting to run CX-CX routes... or more 5k5k FTL ships.... in my mind it's not remotely close.


[03-Feb-25 12:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
For me it's more about the gateway costs, upkeep, and slower speed. I _think_ that 3 gateway jumps from ANT to BEN  is just 50% slower than 2 gateway jumps from ANT to BEN. I _think_ 2 gateway jumps + one FTL jump would be slower than 3 gateway jumps.. from what we know about align... But honestly that hasn't even been coded yet, so that's mostly going off what they said concretely about align times,. and what they said more off-the-cuff during the live youtube thing.


[03-Feb-25 12:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
lots of unknowns 😛


[03-Feb-25 12:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also we already named Hekaton  and Styx 😬


[03-Feb-25 12:14 AM] evov#0000
There's always the potential they'll change the max number of upgrades on a gate so you can get 3 range AND 3 volume upgrades.

Im just pointing out - 5k5k ships do change the considerations. If the majority of CX-CX flight in the future is with 5k ships, and the gate's don't support them, I don't see how the gates ever provide more benefit than they cost.


[03-Feb-25 12:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah probably worth discussion options

[03-Feb-25 12:24 AM] evov#0000
The HRT-MOR link - had the same issue from what I could tell. A 1 system gap somewhere would be needed to allow 5k5k's


[03-Feb-25 12:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
The BEN folks have shared their sheet. Right now they are working towards the BEN -> Styx link, and we are doing the other side. Unfortunately I don't think they are getting too far with it

[03-Feb-25 07:31 AM] bookliko#0000
It might be interesting to consider young companies in the decision making process: it is relatively easy to get a GEN based STL ship with 500/500 capacity. Buying a FTL ship is capital heavy for a young company. 
Having gateways connecting CX for STL ships will enable more players to shop around the galaxy, rather than being constrained by their 2 starter ships. 
The "5k/5k need to be able to use gateways" argument is a late game need. 
I would argue that the player base of smaller STL ships is much larger than the few that commit to HCB.

Larger base of gatewey users = more traffic = healty business case


[03-Feb-25 08:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
repair cost is easy, it's just percent_ship_dmg*plates_to_build


[03-Feb-25 08:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you have shields, then it gets a bit more complicated, but still essentially that with some modifiers


[03-Feb-25 08:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
now if you mean how you actually _accrue_ damage, that's a lot more complicated. I just have a model defined on a small set of routes and the damage they cause to a given ship configuration. I extrapolate that out.


[03-Feb-25 08:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
but I know it's also dependent on ship volume, so with these new HCBs I'd have to get a new set of measurements to base the data off of, given its much larger size


[03-Feb-25 09:46 AM] bookliko#0000
No this is perfect. I simply expected another fancy equation like with BUI degradation 😅 
I want to get the timing down on when to repair, just before the next 'tick'. You will not believe to what lengths i go to min-max this game


[03-Feb-25 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh! yeah it is a similar cliffing mechanism


[03-Feb-25 09:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
but given that plates are nearly 100 per ship, it's typically 1 plate for 1% damage


[03-Feb-25 09:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
above 80% though and speed is not impacted, below 80% and speed is suddenly impacted at -20% and increasing


[03-Feb-25 09:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
so everyone generally agrees to repair just before 80%


[03-Feb-25 09:48 AM] bookliko#0000
The -20% drop is important information!


[03-Feb-25 09:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
speed scales from 80% down to 30% and then stops there


[03-Feb-25 09:49 AM] bookliko#0000
Great info, thanks


[03-Feb-25 05:10 PM] evov#0000
The different gateway setups really only impact CX-CX travel. People with very few ships, or that can't yet afford STL ships... seem highly unlikely to be doing a large amount of CX-CX transport as it's a fairly capital intensive way to make $.

At some point, the gateway network needs to be able to pay for itself. Otherwise, all that capital and industrial development would have just been better spent building more ships for people to achieve the same increase in shipping capacity that the gateways will provide.

Where are our SKFs located?


[08-Feb-25 03:17 PM] akyantor#0000
I have one on Vulcan as I'm throwing off enough spare materials to use one fairly frequently.


[08-Feb-25 06:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems like most of them are on Vulcan


[09-Feb-25 07:58 AM] akyantor#0000
On that same note I can now make occasional supplies of MSL/LSL/LCB/WCB. I think we were short of MSL occasionally when putting together corp packages, so will try to have some of those on hand.


[09-Feb-25 09:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Awesome. Yeah shortest on MSL / MFL in general


[09-Feb-25 10:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Should I keep my WAL until I get 600 👀


[09-Feb-25 10:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I am half way there lol


[09-Feb-25 10:15 AM] mrsmith33#0000

I've got 16 MFL if you need 😉

Okay with this order filled, I'll have 6 2k ships and 1 shielded HCB 😄


[10-Feb-25 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Dang I'm gonna move that to the other channel.


[10-Feb-25 04:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I'll offer the shielded HCB internally first. The corp price is 16m

[10-Feb-25 04:49 PM] zipatsu#0000
Would love to have one with an LFL if that's possible, though I don't mind waiting if others are in more immediate need of one such beautiful ship as that ✌️


[10-Feb-25 11:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have plenty of ZR to make some FLs


[10-Feb-25 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do have a LFL (and a large stl fuel tank too) in stock. Any one else expressing interest, or is Zipatsu the winner? (I'll give folks another half day to respond). It might need a few more plates, but I can probably track em down

For the sake of fairness, might be worth posting it in General too or sending out a ping to give everyone a heads up in case they haven't noticed the message in here yet ✌️


[11-Feb-25 11:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve got one HCB so dibs go to everyone else - jealous of the shielding though 😄


[11-Feb-25 11:52 AM] sidepipe#0000
When I  saw the HCB for the first time, my immediate thought was “think of all the water Zipatsu could move with that” 😁

Oh sweet, the LFL version doesn't add plates

It all being able to fit in one single contract is the best experience I've had in the game this year 😄


[11-Feb-25 05:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah for sure lol


[11-Feb-25 05:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's still a pain to make them


[11-Feb-25 05:19 PM] zipatsu#0000

[11-Feb-25 05:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah and I sent what is probably enough fuel to get it off the planet. Haven't shipped the next load of fuel in yet


[11-Feb-25 05:21 PM] zipatsu#0000
Hadn't even thought of that part yet, thanks! 😄


[11-Feb-25 05:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah I left it out on accident and you can't edit em


[11-Feb-25 05:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I feel like at any given time I have two or three ships flying to Heph 😅


[11-Feb-25 05:34 PM] zipatsu#0000
😄  Maybe they should introduce the idea of shipping lanes where after X many ships have gone back and forth between an area in Y amount of time the damage decreases over time (all those rocks and debris being pushed away off into someone else's driveway)


[11-Feb-25 05:38 PM] akyantor#0000
FYI - have a stockpile of 4 MSL and a couple of LCB.


[11-Feb-25 05:39 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I’ll have enough WAL to perhaps make an HCB a month too, ish.


[12-Feb-25 01:35 PM] zipatsu#0000

You can have the HCB I’m finishing in 20h


[12-Feb-25 07:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I won’t have shields but we might be able to scrape them together among us. I miiight have the rest of the parts for a standard HCB ship.


[12-Feb-25 07:21 PM] draconisdomini#0000
A shielded HCB ship would be a fun "flagship" for the commerce fleet, but a standard one is fine.


[13-Feb-25 11:34 AM] akyantor#0000
I'll happily take whatever APT you have spare. Just send over a contract, or let me know the price and I'll send one.. I'll have another batch of my own in a day or so, which might just be enough to finish the ship off.


[13-Feb-25 11:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I got 69 APT now at 6500/u. I'll send it over


[13-Feb-25 05:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
For another shielded ship I would need:
159    AHP
159    AWH
147    APT

maybe we have those sitting around, otherwise probably gonna be an unshielded 5k


[13-Feb-25 10:09 PM] tyrandia#0000
On the plus side... just getting Deimos running as a hull welding facility instead of smelters, moving smelting to Hylaos.


[13-Feb-25 10:10 PM] tyrandia#0000
So more LHPs and AHPs for the group.


[14-Feb-25 03:02 AM] akyantor#0000
I probably have the AWH/AHP. Not the APT though. 😦

Are the ships we sell to everyone else usually with the LFL or the MFL


[18-Feb-25 03:01 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 3 BR2 and 3 CQL for sale


[18-Feb-25 05:28 AM] akyantor#0000
MFL by the looks of it, though I personally favour the LFL:

[18-Feb-25 09:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah usually MFL 🤷‍♂️  It's been MFL for a very long time but LFL might be a better choice if you aren't short on ZR


[18-Feb-25 09:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
I sent you both 100 FET and some MFK to make 2 MSL each, @bookliko  and @timomurbekov . Lemme know if that doesn't work. Thanks! 😄

ok I will have 3 of each


[27-Feb-25 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Right now I have equal amounts of BR1 and CQM, which is very handy.. and I also have 2x BR2 and 2x CQL


[27-Feb-25 05:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
I would also take those if you want variety in what you make 😆


[27-Feb-25 05:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
will have or rather I do have enroute


[27-Feb-25 05:04 PM] archielvahr#0000

The basic 5k ships are BR1 + CQL, so they might skew the ratio if we keep making those

I see CQLs are crazy on ANT, probably because of the HCB craze. If you want to sell one of them at the CX rate


[28-Feb-25 10:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Here are recent prices https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1270823656830013594/1342609267617955945


[28-Feb-25 10:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah CQLs and CQMs are pretty similar mat wise. If you can get a better price,  you definitely should. But I can also go higher on the CQLs, so whatever works for you


[28-Feb-25 10:05 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I don't see many sells for BR2/CQL


[28-Feb-25 10:11 AM] mrsmith33#0000
How about 1,1M AIC for CQL?


[28-Feb-25 10:15 AM] archielvahr#0000

i dont really need bigger storage per ship, i just need more small ships to speed around

My empire is set up as a hub-and-spoke running the 2 starter ships between hubs and 6 STL puddle jumpers that I largely assembled myself.


[03-Mar-25 01:11 PM] bookliko#0000
Due to my insane obsession with vertical integration: costs of one STL puddle jumper: 214.270 AIC

What sort of puddle jumper do you make? I need one for Nyx and I’ll pay the same rates as the OOG spreadsheet for any parts if you’re interested in selling any 😄


[03-Mar-25 01:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
(Or the price you quote, whichever is higher)

Plus, having a ship out in Nyx will make it a lot easier to govern all those planets (without sending Archiel contracts all the time)


[03-Mar-25 02:19 PM] bookliko#0000
Based on OOG internal prices, I end up at 615.000 including full tank

[04-Mar-25 02:17 AM] evov#0000
You know what's more expensive than ships? Not being able to expand your bases because there's a month long wait on buying a ship. - That's the main reason I started making them.

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Mar-25 03:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
are there still long waiting lists nowadays?


[04-Mar-25 04:01 AM] akyantor#0000
I think at the moment there are quite a few shipbuilders that often have stock. EvoV seems to nearly always have some stock. Archiel more often than not has stock.


[04-Mar-25 05:02 AM] evov#0000
I'll occasionally run short of one part or another. But for the most part, I've got 10+ ships in stock at any point.
Someone could put in an order for 20 ships (not the new HCB), and I'd probably be able to deliver within a week.


[04-Mar-25 05:04 AM] evov#0000
Generally speaking, the Bridge, Crew Quarters and the 2 engines are critical points that take the longest production lines to produce, as a result take the longest time to ramp up increased production. Most of the other parts can be bought on the CX or produced quickly if needed.


[04-Mar-25 09:17 AM] akyantor#0000
I think theres more ship parts available on the CX than has historically been the case too. Or at least I’ve heard that from others


[04-Mar-25 11:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
could I get some advice on this design?

[04-Mar-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think it will be pretty useful for me to get a small and fast ship to hop around the universe doing smaller things, could potentially allow me to make some logistically less demanding bases on planets farther from CX


[04-Mar-25 11:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
cost is big limiting factor however, this could be much better if I had it in my budget to do so. trying to keep it below 3-3.5 mil for it to be somewhat viable to build in the future, currently this design is ~2.7mil


[04-Mar-25 11:17 AM] katinga#0000
I use a smaller ship for supply drops on my bases closer to ANT.


[04-Mar-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
smaller? TCB?


[04-Mar-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats gotta be strictly consumables only then I would assume..

VSC halfs the speed already


[04-Mar-25 11:31 AM] mrsmith33#0000
yeah, minimizing mass and volume helps

yeah but I may redo my "meth" if ENG is on offer


[04-Mar-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
because GEN is utter garbage in terms of speed

Cause no one makes it here?


[04-Mar-25 11:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I use FSE, because it is the most efficient for STL flight


[04-Mar-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
makes sense, bit pricey tho


[04-Mar-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
4.1 mil total


[04-Mar-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
big chunk more than my previous design, but also aloooot faster


[04-Mar-25 12:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
im really just going to have to hold off until i have more money


[04-Mar-25 12:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
If that's 2.7m, you can get one 8x bigger for double the cost, (2k/2k). That's the main challenge with the smaller ships.


[04-Mar-25 12:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[04-Mar-25 12:13 PM] pagy1234#0000
ships go from being extremely ass at 2-3 mil, to being as good as you could reasonably need at 5-6 mil.


[04-Mar-25 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think fast ships are a bit of a luxury. Unless you are basic and you need to _always_ have two ships in flight, then you want to really max out both their speed and cargo size. If you often have ships not in flight, it doesn't make sense to go for fast ships.


[04-Mar-25 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Logistically I only make FSE and QCRs, I do see some very cheap glass engines (GEN) on the market, so maybe that makes sense, honestly haven't really thought about it.

TRIPLE the speed for 1.6 mil more


[04-Mar-25 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you make a small ship and want fast STL flight, you might need to add the fancy seats, or you'll be limited by the g-limit. That kind of always requires testing to determine though (with the blueprint test flight tool)


[04-Mar-25 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

changed alot of things, but price doesnt even go up that much because only few specific parts are actually expensive, and most of them are shared on both ships, BR1/2's CQT, FFC, etc.

{Reactions}
💯 

[04-Mar-25 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ideally, as you grow and can do larger buffers, your 2k/2k ships will be flying full to each base with as much materials as they can hold. Then you'll do less flights overall, and not need to make rush shipments.. unless you make a mistake and forget something or have a high priority item change, etc.

[04-Mar-25 12:20 PM] pagy1234#0000
mannnn, fast ships are awesome tho, but I get your point really doesnt make much sense for me at the moment, il have to wait probably to buy a WCB or 2k/2k, whatever I need more urgently at the time since price difference if just about 1 mil i believe.


[04-Mar-25 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, watching for the BR1->BR2 and crew quarters breakpoints is key


[04-Mar-25 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can also do nice long loans for ships too


[04-Mar-25 12:20 PM] pagy1234#0000
too bad I cant sustain 500k a week paybacks 😭


[04-Mar-25 12:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, thats the problem with fast ships

HYR makes the BR2 jump


[04-Mar-25 12:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
2k/2k is great for shipping water, then you only need to visit your ISA base once every 4 days

{Reactions}
👀 

[04-Mar-25 12:23 PM] pagy1234#0000
that could be useful for me, just not sure how much water il actually end up doing, dont want a ship sitting around for 3 day intervals


[04-Mar-25 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah 4 bases with 2 WCBs might be tough to justify more shipping capacity immediately


[04-Mar-25 12:24 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah lol


[04-Mar-25 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm guessing your ISA is all Rigs, your Harmonia and Phobos are farms, and Nascent is FP?


[04-Mar-25 12:24 PM] pagy1234#0000
yep


[04-Mar-25 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you make HER?

also getting a HAL base going probably tomorrow unless I forgot something


[04-Mar-25 12:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
nah, just RAT and DW


[04-Mar-25 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
okay. So adding HER, FIM, and MEA are a way to add to that chain and also drastically reduce shipping


[04-Mar-25 12:26 PM] pagy1234#0000
so more farming bases?


[04-Mar-25 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or shift what you have if it's overloading you.


[04-Mar-25 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
HER grows way slower than MAI in terms of tons-per-day


[04-Mar-25 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
then FIM and MEA take a lot of FP time


[04-Mar-25 12:26 PM] pagy1234#0000
hmm


[04-Mar-25 12:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
I might just make a new FP base and farm


[04-Mar-25 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
plus FIM and MEA is great money.  You can plot out like a single IVP and see how much MEA that will support


[04-Mar-25 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Cause Rats turn into FIM, which turn into MEA.


[04-Mar-25 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
It'll reduce shipping needs and you'll have enough cash to buy a new ship 😄


[04-Mar-25 12:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
farms probably on deimos (if there are any plots left) or demeter, then FP on SE-052a or SE-110a


[04-Mar-25 12:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh neat, i can just leave that going foreve then

{Reactions}
💯 

[04-Mar-25 12:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
both SE-052a amd SE-110a will be expensive as hell to build on D:


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
and hermes is kinda far?


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
but logistics should be pretty light you said


[04-Mar-25 12:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
so maybe 1 trips every 2 or 3 days


[04-Mar-25 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, SE-110a requires some extra stuff. But it is next to ISA, so that is convenient. If you make DW there,  you can just unload from ISA.


[04-Mar-25 12:34 PM] pagy1234#0000
OHHH


[04-Mar-25 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000

By the way, is the price in the shipbuilding sheet really that low? I thought STL ships were more expensive, but it’s also been a long time since I bought one


[10-Mar-25 12:52 PM] bookliko#0000
Some of the mats in there are surprisingly low. But then again, internal prices.


[10-Mar-25 12:52 PM] bookliko#0000
Also, this puddle jumper carries only 500t


[10-Mar-25 12:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, please adjust prices up for any items that have thin margins. I know it’s been a long time since those have been reviewed 😄


[10-Mar-25 12:57 PM] bookliko#0000
I need to decide how to define reasonable margins first...


[10-Mar-25 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
If the internal prices are just bonkers low... it's because the price is probably 3 years old. lemme know and we can fix it

pretty useful once you have more than like 3 bases

I don't actually think the HCB market is very liquid.


[15-Mar-25 07:41 PM] evov#0000
I've sold a few. But yeah, I think for the majority of players 11mil is a pretty big one off expense for a ship.


[21-Mar-25 11:37 AM] allocater#0000
I have been out of the ship-building game for a year. What is the consensus on RCT vs QCR these days?


[21-Mar-25 11:47 AM] mrsmith33#0000
HYR


[21-Mar-25 11:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do all QCRs, they are basically the same amount of effort as RCTs


[21-Mar-25 11:52 AM] allocater#0000
but how much faster are they? I value speed now over fuel.


[21-Mar-25 11:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
IIRC all FTL engines have equal consumption per speed. Bigger engines just offer higher max speed


[21-Mar-25 12:01 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Same ship (left RCT, right HYR), same consumption == equal time

[21-Mar-25 12:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you turn down a HYR so you get their at the same time as a you would with a QCR, you take a lot less damage, because damage is applied as a function of reactor usage. So that's a nice bonus. Regarding speed, I think MrSmith has got it


[21-Mar-25 12:02 PM] allocater#0000
very interesting!


[21-Mar-25 12:03 PM] allocater#0000
I always fly my QCRs at 100% so more would be welcome


[21-Mar-25 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you can only fly two ships at a time, I imagine you want two HCBs 😉


[21-Mar-25 12:06 PM] mrsmith33#0000
In the example above the damage is 33% less. Looks like only CHRG phase changes the damage (DEP includes one CHRG).


[21-Mar-25 12:13 PM] allocater#0000
I don't think I can ever fill them 😄


[21-Mar-25 12:14 PM] allocater#0000
it's a lot of low volume routes


[21-Mar-25 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, my HCB has that problem somewhat. Mine has QCRs and LHPs.. and I flew it out to Nyx totally full. That was a bit of a mistake. It was hard to unload and took 2.5d each way. 😆

[21-Mar-25 05:31 PM] evov#0000
I like QCR's. Running at very low fuel usage. Most of the reactors allow faster FTL travel with more fuel usage. QCR's benefit is on the charge up time, not the max power of FTL flight. So they're the only one ( I think ) that gives speed benefits while using super low fuel settings.

If you're cranking up the fuel usage - the HPR/HYR options are better and allow for a bigger exchange of fuel for speed.

I went over the prices of everything and rates I have been paying everyone for parts:

External Price:
$20,793,960
Internal Price:
$15,397,700.00

(rebate of $5,396,260.00)


[05-Apr-25 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
And I believe I have 4 of the Standard 2k/2k ships. 
External price: $5,950,000.
Internal Rebate: $441,680


[05-Apr-25 09:07 PM] exeler#0000
I've been wanting to try out the new 5k/5k ships. Any reason I can't buy both of those HCB kits?

I don't want to hog em, but I also wouldn't mind buying both if you're looking for buyers


[05-Apr-25 09:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds good to me, I think they haven't been selling super fast. And I can have more HCBs fairly quick. (the shields take a bit longer to assemble)


[05-Apr-25 09:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Id buy one but im broke from getting new bases


[05-Apr-25 09:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Previously I had unshielded ones a lot cheaper too


[05-Apr-25 09:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like broke broke


[05-Apr-25 09:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like 100k broke


[05-Apr-25 09:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
The one I made for myself has a QCR and I think it's too underpowered


[05-Apr-25 09:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
😮 well, as long as you are growing, it'll work out!


[05-Apr-25 09:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh I’m not worried

I'll see if anyone else chimes in, but I am finishing up the RDLs, then I will send them over after a few days

[06-Apr-25 12:39 AM] exeler#0000
Sweet, if noone chimes in I'll happily buy both. I've been running like 5 2k/2k ships on consistently full runs to move tons of crops and ore around. 

I've got 6 free permits and 50 mil in liquid cash, might as well buy some ships and throw down some new bases 😄

[07-Apr-25 03:53 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm currently making roughly equal quantities of AHP/AWH/ATP/SRP at a rate of 9-10 units a day. I'm trying to decide whether I start using new permits to increase production. My gut feeling is there's more demand out there to be met. 

@archielvahr you've been packaging up some shielded ships. If there was more supply at corp rates would you sell more? *There's quite a few open orders even on the open market, that I'd probably factor in too*.


[07-Apr-25 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think so. If I had an even supply I'd probably do more shielded LCBs.


[07-Apr-25 03:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
As usual, balancing everything is a bit of a challenge. I picked up some extras on the CX and that helped even things out


[07-Apr-25 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
I may see how I could go about it. I've at least one unused permit that's ready to go, so could have a look at reconfiguring to make more. I'd ideally find a way to double while maintaing a roughly equal production.


[07-Apr-25 03:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a supplier for fuel tanks and cargo bays, so I have an overload of those at the moment. I actually have extra CQLs and BR2s, but will need more CQMs (and probably more BR1s)


[07-Apr-25 03:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think shields are still the way to go, it just takes a really long time to make a ship's worth of them


[07-Apr-25 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
and I'm not sure how the income per permit works out on the shields


[07-Apr-25 04:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a few more unshielded 2k/2k ships to upgrade myself


[07-Apr-25 04:04 PM] akyantor#0000
I don't know that it's spectacularly profitable, but more interested in providing the utility and filling a niche.


[07-Apr-25 04:04 PM] akyantor#0000
I still have one of my own to upgrade too


[07-Apr-25 04:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sweet, then yeah, by all means 😄


[07-Apr-25 05:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I can do it if I substantially reconfigure 4 bases and establish one more chem base. Would yield a daily balanced production of around 22-23 units.


[07-Apr-25 05:40 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm not in any rush, but might gradularly make changes in that direction.


[09-Apr-25 04:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I am going to get another HCB online before I start any more expansion. Will be easier to have a bit more slack in ship logistics. 🙂


[09-Apr-25 07:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @exeler  I sent your two ships but apparently I confused LFL and LSL so it's gonna be a day or two before the last bit arrives


[09-Apr-25 07:02 PM] exeler#0000
Okay, that's alright. No rush from me on these


[11-Apr-25 09:27 AM] akyantor#0000
Is anyone making RDL/RLS regularly?


[11-Apr-25 09:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I will be doing them once I get my plactic base running

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Apr-25 09:28 AM] akyantor#0000
I was having a look as my order for RDL wasn't filled. Looks extremely complicated, even worse than AWH. 😛


[11-Apr-25 09:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 100 SRD, but not enough PSL atm


[11-Apr-25 09:30 AM] melon164#0000
I'm making two RDL right now, but didn't want to jump the gun on promising them


[11-Apr-25 09:31 AM] melon164#0000
they'll be done in 3d


[11-Apr-25 09:32 AM] akyantor#0000
np


[11-Apr-25 09:36 AM] akyantor#0000
Definitely don't want to double up then if two of us are on drones. 😉


[11-Apr-25 09:37 AM] akyantor#0000
I've started work on a fairly large restructuring of my empire to 2.5x increase production of equal quantities of AWH/AHP/SRP/APT. Will product 22-23 units a day when finished. So hope the shield demand continues, as it's going to take a while to transition.


[11-Apr-25 09:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I will be making a second HCB-max soon


[11-Apr-25 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah we should have more of a stockpile of RDL, I'm also totally out of them.


[12-Apr-25 12:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
why is the price for the SCBs marked as "d" in the spread sheet?

[17-Apr-25 01:18 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I can make one after I get these LUs done


[17-Apr-25 02:04 AM] melon164#0000
I have one on ANT


[17-Apr-25 05:45 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I will have 1 on ANT in 12 hr


[17-Apr-25 07:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have noticed that the soon-to-be great MM items do share some simmilar parts with some ship parts, like SAR, TRN and a few others, are those expected to have some shortages when people shift to those MMs?


[17-Apr-25 08:42 AM] mrsmith33#0000
IME only SAR is slow to produce


[17-Apr-25 08:50 AM] melon164#0000
Just build 5 ELP mostly turning out SAR, you'll not notice any slowness 😉


[17-Apr-25 08:51 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 3 ELP, but I also produce other stuff on occasion


[17-Apr-25 10:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think a lot of them will be more available on the CX after the change.


[17-Apr-25 03:01 PM] evov#0000
I agree with Archiel. I think a lot of those parts that go towards making ships will start to be more publicly available / traded on the CX. I can't speak for other ship builders, but I make all those bits myself out necessity. The market price is/has been irrelevant for them because I need them, and there's not enough available.

It leads to things like some bases looking like they're loosing money, while others look like they're making squiilions.


[17-Apr-25 09:45 PM] pagy1234#0000
Lol, I think prun planner is pretty bad for those rarely traded items, something like SAR maked amazing profit, while the majority of other electronics are in the red.


[17-Apr-25 11:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Great! What's the going rate for a CQL these days?


[18-Apr-25 12:26 AM] melon164#0000

[18-Apr-25 12:43 PM] pagy1234#0000
pretty fast but for cost reasons I skip out on the STL speed to allow me to make bases further away seem more reasonable


[18-Apr-25 12:43 PM] pagy1234#0000
rn I dont have a base further than 5 jumps from ANT which kinda limits me from being able to expoit more favorable planets


[18-Apr-25 12:46 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I would add STS and maybe FSE


[18-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
I have been told that FSE basically never pays itself off so unless theres another benefit then im not too sure


[18-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
also, whats STS?


[18-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
the stability system?


[18-Apr-25 12:49 PM] pagy1234#0000
I dont have any planets that are high/low gravity


[18-Apr-25 12:51 PM] pagy1234#0000
are there alot of planets that do have high/low gravity?


[18-Apr-25 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly just gas giants are high gravity, places you'd be extracting gasses


[18-Apr-25 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's actually a really heavy hit on durability, but they are pretty rare


[18-Apr-25 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have free STS though 😄

[18-Apr-25 03:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
Good to have APT though, one planet in particular is killer


[18-Apr-25 03:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
Agamemnon is real bad


[18-Apr-25 03:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I just knew it was a gas planet so I was checking 😅

[18-Apr-25 10:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup I can send you one on Heph


[18-Apr-25 10:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
oof, thats about 330k extra for my ship, is it really worth it?


[18-Apr-25 10:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
In general, shields are maybe not worth the capital expense for your first ships - since you have better things to do with the capital. It's worth it in the long run though. As for your APT you should try the flights you have planned just in case.  Usually for shields you want to do all or nothing. But there are special cases where one shield type is particularly good

I'm wondering if it makes sense to retrofit my LCB super shields with HCBs


[21-Apr-25 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think it'd be cheaper given the cost of all the shields


[21-Apr-25 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
plus I have like 9 ships, I don't wanna deal with more lol


[21-Apr-25 11:59 AM] akyantor#0000
It might be an option. I'm only just building my 7th, so don't feel like I'm overkill at the moment on the ship front.


[21-Apr-25 12:00 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd still like to go back and retrofit the three I have without shields to add them, but trying to space that out with supplying to meet demand.
