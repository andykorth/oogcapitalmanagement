I think a shipyard on ISA (planet c) would be pretty handy


[28-Feb-24 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been doing a lot of ANT -> ISA ( c ) -> b -> d -> ANT. I've never had such efficient routes

awesome, I'll kick off another Immigration-PIO program.
Next POPR is in 2 days.


[04-Mar-24 01:08 PM] higgsy#0000
I'll get started on building that shipyard


[04-Mar-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lemme know if you need any parts. I do have some afabs laying aroudn


[04-Mar-24 05:31 PM] exeler#0000

I sent a ship to ISA with all the fabs to build a shipyard except for 24 ASE. Anyone got some?


[07-Mar-24 12:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sure, I'll bring it over

[13-Mar-24 10:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
Is anyone willing to contribute to the COGC on SE-110b in a few days when it comes available? I have all the mats you need on the planet, so I can send them to you. I just can't contribute them until I build my own base on the planet


[13-Mar-24 11:00 PM] tuffyless#0000
Good lookin' out Sidepipe!  
I can do this until ya get here; send at your convenience.
We're locked-n-loaded for the next 10 days.


[14-Mar-24 09:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
I've also got COGC stuff on most of the SE-110 planets, since it is so cheap. So just remind me if any of those planets are coming due

[24-Mar-24 12:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôll be looking to bring in more pio to the planet, it seems like unemployment is starting to get a little low


[08-May-24 06:46 PM] tuffyless#0000
Do ya'll think the Taxes for Food on SE-110a should be dropped to like 15 for PIO and everything else left the same?


[08-May-24 06:46 PM] tuffyless#0000
Nearby Food CoGC's are close to that.  
KW-602c is 20 but Norwick & Hermes is 15.


[08-May-24 07:04 PM] tuffyless#0000
It's kinda beginning to feel like FCST is thinking about trying to take over governorship of 110a.   They've got 110c & 110d currently.


[08-May-24 07:34 PM] exeler#0000
If we need more votes, I could benefit from slapping down a food base and throwing votes our way


[08-May-24 07:41 PM] tuffyless#0000
I think we got the votes currently but they're saying more of their members are coming.
Nevertheless, come join the Foody party. üôÇ

**FCST** - Harpercz, Komarlarn
**OOG** - Hernanduer, Tuffy, Sidepipe, Archiel, MrSmith33
**Other** - Taiyi, xepiov, Marismols


[08-May-24 08:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
FCST is pretty small and originally wanted to set up the se110 system but we ended up doing most of the infrastructure projects for them. We didn‚Äôt really have enough governors to run all those planets in OOG


[08-May-24 08:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are pretty small planets so they should be easy to run. I guess I haven‚Äôt checked in with them so I don‚Äôt know if they have grown. I‚Äôd be surprised if they could or would try to forcibly take any planets from us there


[08-May-24 08:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Forcibly as in without coordinating it explicitly with us


[08-May-24 08:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
The COGC should not change on any of the planets. That was all discussed and agreed on.


[08-May-24 08:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
The difference between taxes of 10 and 20 is basically trivial. So I think it doesn‚Äôt really matter either way.


[08-May-24 08:48 PM] tuffyless#0000
Thinking will leave the taxes alone; 110c & 110d are 20's for PIO.


[08-May-24 08:49 PM] tuffyless#0000
Sounds like SET's are coming to 110a soon.  FER's anyone? üôÇ


[08-May-24 08:53 PM] tuffyless#0000
I might have misunderstood their intentions; 
at first seemed like they saying since they paying for the CoGC might-as-well take governorship of.


[08-May-24 08:54 PM] tuffyless#0000
But in my mind ... with us having put up the CoGC's, ADM's, Shipyards, etc that ya, ya'll can pay for the CoGC for abit.


[14-May-24 07:48 PM] tuffyless#0000
INF is up on 110a now.  So FER's are now viable.


[08-Jun-24 08:09 PM] tuffyless#0000
Damn it!  We all missed the vote for CoGC on 110b.  No +25% this week.

[04-Aug-24 02:11 AM] exeler#0000
I put in a motion on Thallassa-B to drop Agriculture taxes to the minimum as well as just a 5mil AIC donation from me. I'm interested in taking care of the planet, but not in min-maxing the system to have taxes pay for things. I don't think leaving taxes on while the money just pools up in the government bank is the best way to go forward.

The donation is there to cover the costs of any future infrastructure upgrades should they be needed, but the population is doing pretty good right now.


[05-Aug-24 08:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
How about instead you just leave taxes and don't touch the built up money? I don't like the idea of Rise or some goon coming in and kicking you out because you're not playing the game the way they think you should


[05-Aug-24 10:28 AM] exeler#0000
That's actually partly why I want to try this. 

I don't think Rise cares about this planet, but if he wanted to move in he'd need to propose raising taxes to do so. Only reason it'd make sense to vote for that is if the planet was missing pop or something.


[05-Aug-24 10:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I don't think he cares either, nor does he have the leverage on Thalassa planets

Thoughts on upgrading the warehouses on Thalassa A and B? I had a few people ask about it since the single warehouse makes it a bit harder to build a base on the planet in one go


[04-Sep-24 11:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
I could contribute some bfabs to the effort, I‚Äôve got a good amount sitting around right now


[04-Sep-24 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'd say go for it. Thalassa B has a 5,640,000 in the bank, most of that was from a single 5m donation from @exeler  I think the bill should only be a few 100k, depending how far you go


[04-Sep-24 01:24 PM] exeler#0000
I've got a ton of money and bfabs around, I can slap a few levels on B if there's demand for it.

If anyone doesn't have a HYF base yet and wants one, the pop on Thalassa-b is skyrocketing.

There's always the age old strategy of setting an alarm. 

Back in the day I used to play some of those mmorts games and that was a common practice amongst the uber try-hards.

[23-Nov-24 06:34 PM] exeler#0000
Or their entire campaign strategy is just "be first on the list".

Looking at when you dropped the base, I would suggest to repair every 60 days, instead of 45. You will have more time to collect the cash. Also, can drop a /order here for something like 9k per unit or even lower.


[10-Mar-25 05:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, following the repair guide spread sheet its actually 75 days somehow, so thats what Im going to go with

I was just checking it because some portions of my FP base are nearing the optimal repair time

Is it worth it to plop down a HYF base on SE-110b? the ROI is kinda bad for CAF (FP base soon to be on SE-110a) unless I offset it by producing tons of ALG at the same time, Is that just how HYF's are? or is the yield affected by anything?


[11-Mar-25 09:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
actually, it makes no sense to make COF aslong as you make H2O, its so cheap to make DW that I loose money by turning it into COF


[11-Mar-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
I might do a tiny amount to supply myself but other than that theres no point


[11-Mar-25 09:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
for current DW prices it only make sense to do DW. but it was not always the case. COF didn't really change that much in price, but DW is so expensive now


[11-Mar-25 09:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, It seems that COF is actually decently cheap currently compared to what it could be


[11-Mar-25 09:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
also, HYF eats up so much H2O


[11-Mar-25 09:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, you‚Äôll definitely want a dedicated water base if you make HYF


[11-Mar-25 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
COF is still reasonably profitable, but I wouldn‚Äôt focus on making only that from HYF - a mix between COF and RAT makes pretty decent money


[11-Mar-25 10:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
I already do, just that I use most of it to make DW


[11-Mar-25 10:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
Maybe that way makes more sense, I was looking moreso at making my future full DW base focused towards DW, but have a little COF production on the side, but nah, it just looses me money


[11-Mar-25 10:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
Only way its positive gain is if I make just enough to supply myself


[11-Mar-25 10:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ah yeah, makes sense. Margins on DW are just too good / margins on COF are just too low to be worth making a whole HYF base for it


[11-Mar-25 10:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
But if you‚Äôre running FPs, I know folks here (including me) will auction CAF occasionally so you can make a few batches of your own COF


[11-Mar-25 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
CAF and COF prices do fluctuate occasionally, and slowly. It was a while ago, but there was a concern about running out and probably some people moved into the market. I am pretty happy with my HYF base, it supplies several other bases of INCs and FPs, and it's pretty flexible with what I make with it.


[11-Mar-25 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if DW is making good money for you right now, stick with that

Should I run another immigration on `d`?


[19-Mar-25 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably, just to keep ahead of the curve. They are pretty cheap


[19-Mar-25 12:09 PM] mrsmith33#0000
done


[14-Apr-25 01:22 PM] bookliko#0000
Uncoordinated upgrade of WAR dropped on ISA. 2.2 M worth of MAT's. Wish people would at least give a heads up. Trying to roleplay self sufficiency here. 
At least at current rent will make ROI in 220 odd days.

You‚Äôre invited too, @pagy1234 - unless you‚Äôre wanting to use STL ships, it‚Äôs probably easier to join an existing planet


[25-Apr-25 12:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, but I chose SE-110e because then I dont need FTL for shipping H2O


[25-Apr-25 12:30 PM] pagy1234#0000

actually, maybe stupid idea, but to attract more PIOs, couldnt I drop a couple HB1s there to grab them?


[25-Apr-25 12:34 PM] pagy1234#0000
or would that not work


[25-Apr-25 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
That wouldn‚Äôt work afaik, you‚Äôd need to add FP or something as well to provide jobs - otherwise they still count as unemployed


[25-Apr-25 12:38 PM] pagy1234#0000
ah, ok


[25-Apr-25 12:58 PM] bookliko#0000
I would argue that one does not need ADM per se on a very fresh planet. SST and perhaps INF should do the trick to generate enough happiness.


[25-Apr-25 12:59 PM] bookliko#0000
Only when there is need to do policies does ADM become interesting


[25-Apr-25 02:08 PM] evov#0000
Waiting for passive immigration is really slow on a brand new planet. I guess it depends on how profitable that planet is (or would be once it's fully operational with pop/experts etc). The way I see it, every planet will need an ADM eventually, so delaying it hurts in the short term and you still end up having to buy it later anyway. Just put it down at the start so you've got immigration programs asap


[25-Apr-25 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Phobos will cover those buildings too


[25-Apr-25 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, ADMs aren't too expensive, it's worth it to be able to run the programs without a hassle.


[25-Apr-25 04:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just build them all at once, can't be bothered to piecewise it. LM, level 1 WAR, COGC and ADM, 1 SST and 1 INF is good for a while.

about 25-30 days on SE-110c and A, currently SE-110e has basically no pop, but if there was pop, it would be about the same


[28-Apr-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
and ISA has to be a double permit
