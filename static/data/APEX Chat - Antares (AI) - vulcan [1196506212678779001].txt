**SFScorpio**:	fyi, I will not run for governor again after the next term due to me having a lot of traveling later this spring. So would be nice if someone steps up - in case there are questions ping me ingame or better Discord <3 Vulcan

[27-Mar-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	most non-starters are this quiet lol


[27-Mar-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	maybe we need some humans around.  they tend to be fairly noisy\


[27-Mar-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harpercz**:	its a smelting planet, its freaking hard job, no time to talk :D


[27-Mar-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I don't pay my PIOs to talk. I pay them to get in the smelter and release whatever is slowing the system down!


[27-Mar-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Their sacrifices are a burden I am willing to bear.


[27-Mar-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FEDO**:	Talking distracts PIOs from working


[27-Mar-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FEDO**:	Maximum efficiency! Nothing less will be tolerated!


[27-Mar-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	I am much more permitting.  I allow my Vulcans to meditate, play chess, and play the Vulcan lute.  We even have a Sehlat as a base mascot

[28-Mar-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I will happily sacrifice to the Vulcan dieties to keep my AL cranking


[28-Mar-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	I was in a corp.  it was boring, so I left it


[28-Mar-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	it didn't do me any favors being there


[28-Mar-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The ingame Corp is useful only for the 10% production bonus on whatever planet they have the HQ


[30-Mar-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FEDO**:	not really, depends on the corp you join. a lot of bigger corps will help with expansion a lot


[30-Mar-24 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FEDO**:	at least from my experience in Kawa Corp


[30-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	they specified ingame corp


[30-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the benefits you get from KAWA don't come from the ingame corp


[30-Mar-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Hence why I say ingame Corp. The discord Corp is completely separate


[31-Mar-24 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	right


[31-Mar-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	I didn't say it was an ingame corp


[31-Mar-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	You assumed it


[31-Mar-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	From what I can tell, FEDO is the only person in KAWA


[31-Mar-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	FEDO is in a corp made solely to receive Vulcan taxes. This is extremely common because of how the governing mechanics in this game work


[31-Mar-24 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	KAWA is a group not dissimilar to our own, a group of people working together on various things. They don’t have a single in game corp because the game neither requires it nor rewards it (quite the opposite)

**TuffyLess**:	I'll buy it all, thanks for the chat post


[02-Apr-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FEDO**:	as roganartu said, we have lots of separate in-game corps for governing different planets, however we still are a single group centered around our discord server

**Katinga**:	moo?


[23-Apr-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	why ppl sell stuff below production costs?


[23-Apr-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it's probably not below production costs for them


[23-Apr-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	its cuz I'm failing at logistics and FE is so goddamn heavy


[23-Apr-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	and yes I'm still making a bit of profit at that price


[23-Apr-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	got another ad up for FE if someone could be so kind as to unclog my base


[23-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	no but if one would buy FE and O on CX, and make STL - then the price on CX doesn't make any sense


[24-Apr-24 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	I'm out of C now


[24-Apr-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

People always seem to freak out within the first 24 hours, nothing wrong with letting folks have their day (keep in mind, its July 4th for us Americans) and given time to press the button on their vote when they are free.

[16-Aug-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SFScorpio**:	Hello everyone! Latest POPI looks great as well and we'll continue to expand those higher tier populations going forward. I know of people who plan to drop quite big TEC/ENG bases, so Vulcan seems to be developing in this direction.


[16-Aug-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SFScorpio**:	While on this, some insights: According to Archiels sheet Vulcan needs roughly 250k / week for upkeep (+50k COGC) while only yielding 155k / week so far. This is fine to cover, but I still want to change the very PIO/SET focussed local rules - currently we're at 20/25/40/150/20 to a scheme close to other planets like Vallis, Heph or Nike. Therefor putting in a motion to change to a 18/30/80/600/1200 scheme.

[28-Oct-24 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-24 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SFScorpio**:	According to my calculations we'll have decreasing ENG numbers als long as there is unemployment. There would be two ways forward: we let this creep down and everyone who has their ENG should be fine, but no capacity to spare. Or we build an ART and supply UTS, so their happiness is just above the threshold (+0.51 ENG at the moment) and keep some stock of them.

**Roh**:	@SFScorpio you're planet is fine. Just let the POPRs cycle for 1-2 months, and then you can re-adjust for future metrics.


[11-Dec-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I could advise slamming down a policy of... new ENG bases need to communicate with GOV/PM for full workforce fulfillment, or just do partial, incremental builds per POPR metrics.


[11-Dec-24 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But right now, you have high POPR unemployment rates, which are eating up a lot of your need provisions via upkeep. It's best to not compound unemployment, by tendering even more upkeep materials for POPI.. It seems that a few players have either quite or retooled into higher specs.. I can't tell you what's going on since almost no one communicates in this game :P

**Tanda**:	speaking as a person running ENG here, I would appreciate SOME surplus to absorb the inevitable surprise base. Not everyone communicates before dropping bases here, and I'd rather not eat 2 months of reduced efficiency due to it

**RiseofFilth**:	Things look good, i see no reason to change from SFS's current approach

**SFScorpio**:	Next time please give a heads up if a new ENG base is dropped. I can easily run programs if I know. Hope no one who had all their ENG lost some due to the new base


[30-Jan-25 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i'm down 3


[30-Jan-25 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	not too bad


[30-Jan-25 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	...which implies that there's someone with a lot more engis that lost some since there's 180 open


[30-Jan-25 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I dropped a 10×ASM base (200 ENG), got 41, so I'm most of the deficit, which is fair enough.


[30-Jan-25 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I misread the POPR as everything shifted left by one colum, thought there were 300 unemployed ENGs and 4k unemployed TECs, sorry!

[16-Feb-25 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Tec's should already be covered? 188 change and only needed 63? I'd think eng's are more important? (I'm actually surprised an immigration wasn't ran this week....)


[17-Feb-25 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SFScorpio**:	Yes, I added a motion. There was a program running last week, but after I started voting on the motion, my two colleagues abstained and I forgot to myself then start the programs.
