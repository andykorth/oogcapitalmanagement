didn't notice this channel 🙂 guess I'll drop a notice when I bring another load of H2O from I.S.A


[22-Nov-22 02:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
ANT's warehouse is nearly infinite, and it takes 250 LBC to fill it.


[22-Nov-22 02:39 AM] balbar#0000
but at 300AIC/unit you are looking at a pretty heft cost if you actually use that much


[22-Nov-22 03:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
Each 100AIC / week


[22-Nov-22 03:13 AM] balbar#0000
ah, 300 because i use 3 🙂


[22-Nov-22 03:13 AM] yuen8241#0000
I used 20.


[22-Nov-22 03:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, it's nothing. It's equivalent to a freight.


[22-Nov-22 10:58 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I will take this opportunity to mention that I have a lot of Sulfur here on ANT, if anyone ever needs some let me know 🙂 my corp price is 80/u


[22-Nov-22 10:59 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Also in a completely unrelated side note Sulfur doesn't sell very well if you're thinking of making it lol


[22-Nov-22 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send you an ad for 30

Do you ever make VG? I've been running wihtout it for weeks now because its impossible to come by


[23-Nov-22 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do make it! Sadly there are a bunch of listings on ANT's CX now and the price has been dropping. But happy to provide it to the corp. I'm about to ramp up production a bunch and I'll probably be listing some on each CX.


[23-Nov-22 03:16 PM] churavis#0000
400 SIO available for 50/u

Haha I don't think @jackinabox86 or myself make a surplus to sell on CX. We sell it all to corp 😅 you guys are a busy bunch! Hard to believe but I think we have a combined 27 REFs running around the clock to fill corp demand. I had 1K FF lying around ANT so I put it up but that's all I have to sell lol

Turns out my Nike base pumps out 6500 SF and 1700 FF per day. That's 12 REFs running about half and half NAB vs GAL recipes with 2 runs of FF per 7 runs of SF. That can change based on what inputs I have on hand though

I do 3600 SF and 1200 FF a day.  not all that exciting any more.  If demand increases, I'll do more on QJ-650c now that I have spare area

As you know, I produce EDC, and now the acquisition of EDC in CX will incur additional expenses. If anyone needs ICA or CIS, you can exchange it with me or buy EDC from me.

DDT production takes up a lot of LAB and CL. When FIM is enough, I can turn to other products.


[12-Dec-22 07:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
True!


[12-Dec-22 07:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm short of TCL and THF, which need LAB. I'm short of EPO, which needs CL.

I'll take 1k RAT, 1k DW and 200 FIM


[12-Dec-22 07:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now that the price of RAT has also increased, it is profitable for FRM and FP to produce RAT instead.

Are you serious? So what do we do with an ANT channel? To do what we could have done on nike channel?


[12-Dec-22 09:59 PM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, the RAT and DW that I intend to give you are also in ANT. I didn't pay attention to the contract content, so I gave you my consumables on nike. Fortunately, I have enough stock.


[12-Dec-22 10:00 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, I am absolutely, one-hundred percent deadly serious and not ever in a million years kidding


[12-Dec-22 10:00 PM] churavis#0000
If you need to you can send me 1 AIC contracts taking back the RAT and DW on Nike and giving it back on ANT


[12-Dec-22 10:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter, my reserve on nike is usually enough for more than 30 days. After I give them to you, I have enough left for 15 days.

Yep. That's definitely the recommendation for most cases.

They use settlers and pioneers, but yeah, it's generally better. Although the PP1  uses PE to make BDEs, and the PP2 uses PG instead.


[19-Dec-22 01:48 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh. Yeah, at least for PE/BDE, it seems more economical. Though I guess the AL offsets that.


[19-Dec-22 01:48 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

Can do. Unfortunately it's just the backup that I make when my labs run out of good stuff to make 😄


[19-Dec-22 03:24 PM] gladeowl#0000
We need more THF? I make it steadily anyway for the INS so I can easily get more Labs up if there's a need for it.


[19-Dec-22 03:39 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I don't know if there is. There's always a mild demand for THF but my demand is very slow (like 100 will last me like 6 weeks, maybe longer) and I think most others are somewhat similar or make it themselves?


[19-Dec-22 03:42 PM] allocater#0000
I make the little I need for ship building myself and a bit for INS


[19-Dec-22 03:45 PM] gladeowl#0000

80 SCN available


[24-Dec-22 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll take 40. Are they 1000/u? (only price I saw on the sheet)


[24-Dec-22 10:36 AM] churavis#0000
Yes, 1k/u


[24-Dec-22 10:36 AM] churavis#0000
I've got more on the way so buy them all


[24-Dec-22 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay you've convinced me. SCN is one of those annoying things to buy 😄


[24-Dec-22 10:39 AM] churavis#0000
SCN is my go to when I run out of SEN or other HOG/MHP inputs for my EDM so I usually have extra on Phobos and ANT


[24-Dec-22 01:33 PM] domicius#0000
I make SCN, so I always have it.


[25-Dec-22 09:47 PM] gladeowl#0000
Who do I need to annoy to get this stuff on ANT?
RAT 240
DW 240
~~OVE 30~~
COF 30
~~PWO 12~~


[25-Dec-22 10:48 PM] churavis#0000
I've got OVE and PWO


[25-Dec-22 10:49 PM] churavis#0000
Anything I sell on Heph or Phobos I also sell on ANT and am probably more likely to have in stock


[25-Dec-22 10:56 PM] gladeowl#0000
I'm an idiot. That's a sell contract.

generally, you need to go to the planet where things are produced.  I do have your BDE and BTA at ANT, so you can send contracts at my price on the spreadsheet


[26-Dec-22 09:51 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I have the LDE, LSE, and LTA on Nike


[26-Dec-22 10:50 AM] gladeowl#0000
Hey, @archielvahr, do you happen to have any of this stuff on ANT?


[26-Dec-22 11:15 AM] martin1194#0000
ok. wait a minute.


[26-Dec-22 11:18 AM] martin1194#0000
But may u mind me paying it within 3 days?
I have a lot of value in assets on the ship. I need to wait for it to arrive to be sold then I can pay for contracts.


[26-Dec-22 11:24 AM] martin1194#0000
u haven't BTA price in the excel.


[26-Dec-22 12:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think BTA is 1000. You can send me a new contract if you want


[26-Dec-22 12:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Take as long as you need to pay. You do need a warehouse on Nike though since I can’t fulfill those

I forgot to rent a warehouse before create contract, my bad. sorry.

Yep, I was traveling, but I have loads of DW.  Apparently no RAT or COF at the moment though


[26-Dec-22 01:39 PM] exeler#0000
I've got a bunch of CAF building up on Harmonia if that helps with the COF at all.


[26-Dec-22 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000

I do want that, but the COF is going to other bases that need it more urgently.

Wasn't ANT supposed to get a BUY/SELL LM. Or did I get that wrong? *don't remember where I read that*

Private contracts are just as good

this 

[27-Dec-22 02:05 PM] exeler#0000
Oh, was that part of the update?

I thought the CXs didn't have a LM because you're supposed to use the actual exchange for trading. 

Doesn't help for longer running orders though.


[27-Dec-22 02:06 PM] churavis#0000

Not sure how PU handles that, but I imagine it gets jettisoned into null space


[28-Dec-22 10:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I can send you a sell contract if you tell me how many you need and then it will be provisioned and ready for you


[28-Dec-22 10:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
otherwise you have to wait for me to fulfill


[28-Dec-22 10:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
and I'm not sure I can fulfill into a ship; perhaps I can, but sometimes that shit is weird


[28-Dec-22 10:04 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I need 20 BDE's


[28-Dec-22 10:05 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I picked up H from another corpie on a random planet this week and it worked fine, though not sure if there's a difference between provisioning for pickup, and direct fulfillment or whatever


[28-Dec-22 10:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
you don't have to wait with your ship for two days if I provision; you just click a button when you arrive and it goes to your ship


[28-Dec-22 10:06 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wait was that you lol


[28-Dec-22 10:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
No, it was YJ, but I read the Discord same as everyone!


[28-Dec-22 10:06 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh lol right


[28-Dec-22 10:06 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
So for provision, should I be the one to contract? or do I put an ad up?


[28-Dec-22 10:07 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I think an ad should work right


[28-Dec-22 10:07 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

but yeah, an LM buy would have worked fine


[28-Dec-22 10:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll keep that in mind for next time. I have a whole list of contracts I standardize just so I don't constantly get confused trying to remember where I bought what and for how much


[28-Dec-22 10:09 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll likely be back to buy more soon, if it turns out I can afford to build my 4th base. For now, your BDE's will cement my next(last?) 2 SME's on Deimos, and my 4th HQ tier. 🙂


[28-Dec-22 10:12 AM] jackinabox86#0000
that's crazy


[28-Dec-22 10:12 AM] jackinabox86#0000

The open ones are my sponsor contract related ones


[28-Dec-22 10:18 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I like to include installment info just so we both know how much is owed, repaid this cycle, repaid in total, etc


[28-Dec-22 10:18 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though with the DW one we have a whole system where 6k per week is target and anything over either overpays or gets bought at x price


[28-Dec-22 10:19 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
though right now I'm mostly focused on overpaying to drive down the contract length

[28-Dec-22 10:25 AM] exeler#0000
My contds are all either <Material>@<price> for buy/sell orders or <Location>-><Location> for shipping. 

I'm usually either only buying or only selling something, so I haven't needed to put buy/sell in the name, and locations are usually pretty stable too. Changing just the location is pretty easy though if I need to.


[28-Dec-22 12:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I have four. Buy, sell, ship and one for ore from Balbar bc it is my only recurring stable contract

Can I get another 86 TRU 🙂

We'll whittle down that 1k stock eventually lol

Sent! Only a couple hundred left now, heh


[09-Jan-23 06:42 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Do you still have RAT left on ANT? Turns out I won't make it to Norwick in time to pick up the 500 I bought there before I run out again on Deimos -_- Still, it'll be nice to have a bunch sitting around I can distribute as needed.


[09-Jan-23 06:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll buy whatever's left of your ANT stock


[09-Jan-23 06:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope out of RAT, but I have: 
2000 DW

How much do you need?


[09-Jan-23 06:53 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. Looks like I'll be needing PT/KOM/REP on Griff

Ooh


[09-Jan-23 06:54 PM] dehzhas#0000
Normally I don't charge that much, but I need to burn some fuel to replace these 🙂

How much stock do you have?

If you're going out of your way, I'll go ahead and buy bulk


[09-Jan-23 06:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
I can sell you up to 500 at that rate

atm i dont have excess for water. I have some for ALO and AL on deimos

[14-Jan-23 05:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is that right? that's 8 ships for 6 planets?


[14-Jan-23 06:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yes, it's been driving me nuts for months.  He pays for them quickly now though, so at least it isn't on Allocater's credit


[14-Jan-23 11:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is H2O @ 45 just going to be the new normal now? I need to start buying thousands of it daily on the CX.


[14-Jan-23 11:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Which effectively means no profit on DW's if buying from CX, unless I sell DW's at some crazy high price.


[14-Jan-23 11:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can temporarily switch to production RAT.


[14-Jan-23 11:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Why does this feel like less of an attack on the H2O market, and more an attempt at brute-forcing the DW market?


[14-Jan-23 11:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
My FP now switches production content and no longer produces DW.


[14-Jan-23 11:45 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, I'll probably end up shipping my Harmonia outputs to Heph for now.


[14-Jan-23 11:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
This guy doesn't seem to be going to stop buying water at a price of 45, so we are losing money recently in producing DW or selling DW.


[15-Jan-23 12:18 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is he also driving up DW prices? I really don't understand wtf his deal is. Has anyone tried asking him?


[15-Jan-23 12:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
I guess he's bored with money.


[15-Jan-23 12:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, DW will rise soon. Since you don't have enough sources of H2O, it would be more appropriate for you to produce other things. Now H2O is too expensive.


[15-Jan-23 01:10 AM] gladeowl#0000
What's your daily H2O consumption? You could ship it in from Etherwind, we have a fair few bases there. Or Hamonia, as it's shipped there often.


[15-Jan-23 01:51 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
I believe @zipatsu is setting up a new water base as well (his second) on Ice Station. Might be worthwhile reaching out to him as well & check if he can help out


[15-Jan-23 02:46 AM] allocater#0000
at some point he will run out of money, all sales are blocked and only his moria 45wall is still strong


[15-Jan-23 09:37 AM] yuen8241#0000

Yeah I'd like to sell the BTS too. I don't have a price yet.


[19-Jan-23 11:34 PM] dehzhas#0000
The TA is literally the only thing I need an AML for and I would rather buy into someone else's AML supply rather than support that high level pop on one base.


[19-Jan-23 11:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the lack of BTS / W in the world is why my LFEs are selling for 350k+ 😄


[19-Jan-23 11:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that I can produce Afabs now, it is only a matter of time.


[19-Jan-23 11:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can't use up the output of a BTS base at all.The output is too high.


[19-Jan-23 11:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely


[19-Jan-23 11:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I am happy to sell my BTS to the corp, and probably will never sell it to out of corp people, just to keep my prices high


[19-Jan-23 11:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll just start with BTS at 400. That's $2000 of inputs per W, so still lots of money to be made

Now that FIM is too expensive, consumable manufacturers should all produce a little FIM to make some money.

Close to three times the price of Corp😅


[28-Jan-23 03:05 AM] dehzhas#0000
I'm too busy selling all my FIM on pre-arrange contracts to take advantage 😭

Your sales method has advantages and disadvantages.

{Reactions}
💯 

[28-Jan-23 03:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
The quantity I produce is too large, and I don't have the energy to send contracts one by one, so I'd rather sell cx directly or ask corp if anyone wants to buy it in bulk.


[28-Jan-23 03:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
The contract mechanism in the game now makes it a disaster to handle a large number of contracts.


[28-Jan-23 03:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm tired of dealing with contracts related to shipbuilding and sponsorship 🤣

[28-Jan-23 03:13 AM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, I hear that


[28-Jan-23 03:15 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have a ton of screens setup for each planet + player combination with all the amounts filled in already for a weekly delivery. I just have to copy paste the username between all the boxes and hit send.


[28-Jan-23 03:15 AM] dehzhas#0000
Still a good bit of clicking, but it is mostly mindless and very fast.


[28-Jan-23 03:15 AM] dehzhas#0000

[28-Jan-23 03:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
You mean, if I were your customer, you would set up a separate contract template for all the consumables I bought on a certain planet? And send it to me regularly every week?


[28-Jan-23 03:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
In this case, with the increase of your customers, planets and consumables, your contract template types will be horribly numerous.


[28-Jan-23 03:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
If I were you, I might prefer to stock consumables on all the planets, and then let customers advertise in LM, and I will be responsible for completing them.


[28-Jan-23 03:27 AM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah... I have a TON of contract templates


[28-Jan-23 03:27 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have customers who I sell all of those things to on multiple planets


[28-Jan-23 03:27 AM] dehzhas#0000
One bit screen with lots of tiny boxes of contract templates.


[28-Jan-23 03:28 AM] dehzhas#0000
I don't know why, but I find it fun


[28-Jan-23 03:28 AM] dehzhas#0000
Nothing like dropping off a huge 2k/2k ship and filling 50 contracts on a planet in one go


[28-Jan-23 03:29 AM] dehzhas#0000
I make decent money, but not EDC money and I can't time the market.


[28-Jan-23 03:29 AM] dehzhas#0000
But I give my customers stable prices and mostly regular deliveries.


[28-Jan-23 03:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think you can store consumables and fabs on all planets and sell them at a premium. Consumers who buy things on the planet usually pay higher prices, especially when they are in urgent need. If you become a well-known brand of this game, they will call you as soon as they are out of stock.


[28-Jan-23 03:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
Especially those planets far away from cx, they are not worth a trip for consumables.


[28-Jan-23 03:35 AM] dehzhas#0000
I think that is my next step of expansion


[28-Jan-23 03:35 AM] dehzhas#0000
I probably will keep the customers I have now, most are in-corp anyway, and start offering consumables on all the lM's for a small premium over CX prices.


[28-Jan-23 03:36 AM] dehzhas#0000
If I keep them well stocked, should be able to make decent money


[28-Jan-23 03:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
There are  few people like me who can produce most consumables and like to hoard enough consumables for about 30 days.


[28-Jan-23 03:38 AM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, for sure


[28-Jan-23 03:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
As long as I build an EDM, a CLF, and an APF, I can produce all consumables, which I estimate will be soon.


[28-Jan-23 03:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
But I still won't produce COF and KOM. Their competition is too fierce. I can buy them cheaply in large quantities from HRT.


[28-Jan-23 03:41 AM] dehzhas#0000
I've been real tempted to start CX trading consumables because I can play the various markets pretty easily... I just don't have the logistics capacity to send ships.


[28-Jan-23 03:43 AM] dehzhas#0000
My mode of playing the game is really logistics intensive relative to the number of bases I have


[28-Jan-23 03:43 AM] dehzhas#0000
9 ships and counting, though I think I might be starting to get ahead because I now have ships idling for a few hours a day


[28-Jan-23 03:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
Your business model takes up too much energy and shipping capacity.


[28-Jan-23 03:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
It is completely opposite to EDC economy.


[28-Jan-23 08:04 AM] balbar#0000

I built WU-070A not just for glass but also for SI production


[29-Jan-23 01:06 PM] domicius#0000
Have loads of SIO, but I don't refine it


[29-Jan-23 06:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
I found that I finally achieved the freedom of glass by Wu-070A, and I could throw TUB into Phobos.


[29-Jan-23 06:42 PM] churavis#0000
2.2k MG available on ANT and 1.6k available on Midas, 50/u


[29-Jan-23 06:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
Do you have NCS in wu? I forgot to bring some.

I only have 1.2k INS.


[30-Jan-23 03:49 AM] rune_242#0000
I have 4.7k INS on nike


[30-Jan-23 03:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have 100 TRU in nike.


[30-Jan-23 03:53 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Thanks, I will send contracts on Nike


[30-Jan-23 03:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
Sometimes I find that nike is more convenient to store building materials such as fabs, and sometimes I prefer ANT. It is difficult to decide which is better.🤔


[30-Jan-23 03:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
With the opening of my aceland base, I may transport more fabs to ANT.


[30-Jan-23 03:56 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
All roads lead to ANT, I ship most outputs back there for convenience


[30-Jan-23 06:33 AM] jackinabox86#0000
If you don’t want to go to Nike for the TRU, I have 100 on ANT


[30-Jan-23 06:33 AM] jackinabox86#0000
But I do move all building stuff to Nike so it’s in one place


[30-Jan-23 06:33 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Since that’s where everyone does the ads


[30-Jan-23 08:39 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Anyone have 100-200 FIM?


[30-Jan-23 08:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
You should produce some FIM yourself to hedge the risk.


[30-Jan-23 08:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
The production capacity of agricultural base and FP base is limited.


[30-Jan-23 08:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
For those who are not engaged in EDC, the HER produced by a 500 agricultural base is enough for their engineers.


[30-Jan-23 08:55 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I could but I don't have any FP and I don't really want to bring up a FP base which I don't produce enough inputs to keep going. I'm going to turn my DDT into HER but that's about it.


[30-Jan-23 08:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
The combination of etherwind and kw-602c is very good. DW can be produced at ordinary times, and FIM or RAT can be switched temporarily.


[30-Jan-23 08:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
Just like now, I asked kw-602c to produce FIM, and then shipped H2O back to ANT for chemical industry.


[30-Jan-23 09:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
When I replace a part of RIG of etherwind with INC, I can constantly switch production capacity in products such as FIM, RAT, DW, C and H2O as the market changes.


[30-Jan-23 09:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
A dynamic and flexible industrial chain can provide higher profits and more stable supply.


[30-Jan-23 09:07 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
That's two bases I don't already have and all my FRM output is going to INC


[30-Jan-23 09:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
My six bases in ben have just formed a basic circular industrial chain.


[30-Jan-23 09:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you want to burn carbon to maintain two POL bases, you certainly don't have enough production to maintain FP bases.


[30-Jan-23 09:11 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I'm also not keen on requiring much more in the way of logistics, I'm unlikely to add more than another base or two


[30-Jan-23 09:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
Is your base 500 or 1000?


[30-Jan-23 09:12 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Harmonia + Nascent is enough C for 3x POL bases and an SME base


[30-Jan-23 09:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
The base of 1000 is really very worry-free


[30-Jan-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
But one FP base should correspond to two FRM bases.


[30-Jan-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
So I have to go to ben to do it.


[30-Jan-23 09:13 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah, that's why I said I have no intention of building an FP base I can't supply

{Reactions}
👍 

[30-Jan-23 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
My C basically depends on buying. I already have three agricultural bases and two food bases.

Does someone has 100 KOM here?


[02-Feb-23 06:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
KOM's profit is very low, so you can buy it directly from CX.


[02-Feb-23 06:55 PM] churavis#0000
It's only low because I stopped buying it from the CX. If I bought it from the CX it would become expensive again


[02-Feb-23 07:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
I doubt whether you have such great purchasing power.


[02-Feb-23 07:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
This man sells KOM in large quantities at four CX's at the same time.


[02-Feb-23 07:04 PM] churavis#0000
I didn't mean that I'm directly affecting the market, just that I have super bad luck


[02-Feb-23 07:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
It sounds like you bought a lot of KOM from CX before when KOM was expensive.🤔


[02-Feb-23 07:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Sometimes I have to think about it to understand what you mean. I usually understand English straightforwardly, and it is difficult to read it if it is mixed with self-deprecating elements.


[02-Feb-23 07:23 PM] yuen8241#0000
However, it is still not as difficult as my mother tongue. The same sentence can have four or five meanings.😅


[02-Feb-23 07:49 PM] churavis#0000
The ambiguity is often deliberate as it adds to the humor and meaning


[02-Feb-23 07:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
I often use puns in my mother tongue's daily conversation, but I'm not used to it in English.😆


[02-Feb-23 07:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
In my English study, conversations are basically formal written language.

Where is your BGO?


[22-Feb-23 08:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000

[22-Feb-23 08:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
Did you build GF in these two bases?


[22-Feb-23 08:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
My GL, RG and NG freedoms are realized by Wu. I only have SME, FS, ASM and SKF on these two planets. Considering that you don't have SKF or 5 ASM, it should be easier to realize metal freedom than me.


[22-Feb-23 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
RG and GL produced by this base should be enough.😄

[22-Feb-23 08:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
According to my calculation, as long as you don't have so many ASM to consume Ti and thus occupy SME production capacity, and there is no SKF to occupy space，these two bases are enough for you to produce enough AL, FE, STL, CU, AU and SI for construction, electronics and manufacturing.


[22-Feb-23 08:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
I need to buy al and ti because of 5 ASM and 1 SKF. But if your ASM is mainly used to produce a small amount of alloy for use outside SKF, you don't need to buy in large quantities like me.


[22-Feb-23 08:55 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
@domicius what is your price for the FE and STL? I assume they're on ANT?

It should be because the price increase of FIM is too high, which leads to the decrease of RAT capacity and the increase of RAT consumption.


[26-Feb-23 07:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the final analysis, it is because of inflation

The main trouble with this design is that it needs to transport a lot of crops.


[06-Mar-23 03:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
A LCB ship is needed to ship harmonia-norwick every three days.


[06-Mar-23 03:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
The water HYF needs only needs to be shipped once every 10 days.


[06-Mar-23 09:42 AM] exeler#0000
If you can make the MAI somewhere else with FRM instead of HYF you can get a lot more bang out of the HYF. 

I noticed recently the MAI recipe in the HYF isn't much better than the FRM one. I've been making MAI and GRN on Demeter and HCP on Harmonia.


[06-Mar-23 09:43 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, HYF MAI has to sell for 200 to be competitive with other HYF products

Producing MAI is the most profitable thing for HYF.😅

{Reactions}
😮 

[07-Mar-23 01:02 AM] exeler#0000
But, compared to the FRM recipe it's not much better for volume of crops. You get the "free" bopnus of being able to stack more HYF, and the runtime is lower. So less than 4X the amount per area. Compare that to the HCP recipe though, you get 2X the amount, for less the time, and half the area.

Did you set the prices to something? The prices of crops on the CX is iffy at best, not a lot of people actually sell them on the CX. I find the name of the agriculture game is just to try and produce enough to feed the more profitable consumable and/or C production bases.

I think if you Post up selling, you need to make sure it goes to pie if many people want. If you post your buying and someone sells, then its fine.

We also have a server robot. Nice work, EXeler！😆


[15-Mar-23 02:45 AM] exeler#0000
Thanks! I've got a few other ideas for commands I could add to it. Whether I find time to implement and polish them up enough to subject you all to them is another story 😅

One thing this one doesn't have yet is a way to say "I want a slice, but only make it up to so much". Like if someone only wanted 5k PE, they might not want to click that button since right now the bot would give them a 45k PE slice. 

The bot's calculations aren't law, so it'd be simple enough to say "I only want X", but then the rest of the math is off since there's now an exception the bot doesn't know about.


[15-Mar-23 02:45 AM] exeler#0000
This is a real auction btw. I actually do have 90k PE I'm selling on ANT. I'll close it out sometime tomorrow. If you want some just click the `Bid!` button and I'll send out the contracts when the auction is over.


[15-Mar-23 02:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is the number of PE that everyone can get in the end 90k divided by the number of people who participate in the auction?


[15-Mar-23 02:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
What if one person only needs 5k and one person needs 50K?🤣


[15-Mar-23 02:55 AM] exeler#0000
Yup, it'll evenly divide the whole pie for now. I'm going to add a way to set a "I only want up to X amount" bid. Behind the scenes I have code that handles all of that logic already, I just need to update the discord facing bits to provide an actual input box for people to type a number into.


[15-Mar-23 02:58 AM] exeler#0000
For now though, if the amount the bot assigns you is more than you want to buy, you can work it out with the auction hoster to just send you a smaller contract.


[15-Mar-23 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll take 150 COF, 100 ALE, 25 GIN


[15-Mar-23 11:08 AM] domicius#0000

[15-Mar-23 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we should set a channel for auctions, which i propose only occur on ANT


[15-Mar-23 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
Why only on ANT?


[15-Mar-23 12:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
feels like it'd be a hassle to track which planet.  if others feel differently, that's fine, but we should at least not just embed them in the existing channels where they get buried


[15-Mar-23 12:48 PM] churavis#0000
It would be an even bigger hassle to have to truck my STL, FE and FEO to ANT just to auction it off when much of it is going to be used on Deimos anyways


[15-Mar-23 12:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
fair enough


[15-Mar-23 12:59 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, that's my thought as well. I think auctioning an item where it is sold is handy. 

I do see the problem of the auction being drowned in other conversation though. 

Perhaps I can add a command that'll list active auctions? Then it'll at least be easy to grab a current list.

Or a channel somewhere where the bot can just maintain a list of active auctions? So we can have the best of both worlds? Start an auction in the channel for where you want to sell the things, then there's also a place where all of them can be easily seen?


[15-Mar-23 01:00 PM] churavis#0000
That's a good idea

[09-Apr-23 11:13 PM] churavis#0000
There's a bit of a shortage both in corp and out, you may want to consider a base on KI-840c


[09-Apr-23 11:14 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ok will do, shame it's not a metallurgy planet, we could possibly use another one


[09-Apr-23 11:15 PM] churavis#0000
There's a few other metallurgy bases there, you might be able to swing it


[09-Apr-23 11:15 PM] churavis#0000
Especially with where the price of CU has been


[09-Apr-23 11:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ah, WU-070a is metallurgy and CU needs SIO so I could just do both of those I suppose


[09-Apr-23 11:25 PM] churavis#0000
Thats a possibility, although it is oxygen that poses the biggest issue


[09-Apr-23 11:28 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I've just started an Electronica base for more BOR, I can fill the rest of the space up with COL for O for roughly 200/day


[09-Apr-23 11:29 PM] churavis#0000
200 per day is not enough for a full CU base


[09-Apr-23 11:41 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
No but it will work for this which will also allow me to move SI and BRO production

Yeah, I turn it into BRO there

Auction up for a bunch of CAF. I just noticed I had a stockpile that's been building up for a whiiiile 😅 

Price isn't as low as I'd like it to be since I've been paying out the nose for NS (a problem I plan on solving soon)


[30-Apr-23 02:18 AM] allocater#0000
600 for NS can't be sustainable, that's 200k/day for a chemical base


[30-Apr-23 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
@dehzhas Hey, do you have COF? Or has anyone COF? I need around 150 - 200 units. I know it's 400/u so.


[30-Apr-23 09:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's looking like HMS is under supplied. Gonna start up a couple CLF since it looks like at 5 experts you get maybe 20/d per bui

[30-Apr-23 09:15 AM] churavis#0000
Careful, traders are going to bring some in from other CX long before you finish your production line so plan on the price in ANT coming down to be more similar to other CX


[30-Apr-23 09:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah it's still highly profitable even at those levels

{Reactions}
👍 

[30-Apr-23 01:13 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Good luck getting COF for 400, there is limited supply everywhere that's why the price is so high on the CX


[30-Apr-23 01:57 PM] churavis#0000
I think prices may need to be updated on the sheet


[30-Apr-23 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Apr-23 05:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I think it would also be nice if the spreadsheet only had things that can be regularly produced and sold, all the people listed as selling RATs don't really sell them in meaningful quantities


[30-Apr-23 06:57 PM] exeler#0000
I agree with that. 

I generally only put goods that I produce an excess of on the sheet. If someone DMs and says I need 10000 of X, and I put X on the sheet I should be able to provide a predictable timeline for making that many. 

It might be slow for a large order, but is reasonably doable.


[30-Apr-23 07:02 PM] churavis#0000
Some people mark the things that need to be ordered in advance

I just collected the monthly haul from my EPO base; gonna wait a bit before doing an auction.


[13-May-23 02:24 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I guess when the price hit 200, a lot of bases went up.


[13-May-23 02:27 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I was on the road to making Rfabs, but the price fell quite a bit and I've stopped that train. Not sure whether I should aim for Afabs or pivot to something else entirely.


[13-May-23 03:48 AM] domicius#0000
For me the issue wasn't price as much as availability. For a while you couldnt get r-fabs reliably


[13-May-23 04:11 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Exactly why I was moving that way (though I keep getting sidetracked, so still not there 2 months later)


[13-May-23 04:14 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I'm dropping all construction including r-fabs except for some WEL for ship engine production


[13-May-23 08:30 AM] allocater#0000
but an r-fab base is still 200k/day, or do you think there won't be demand for it?

[13-May-23 09:56 AM] churavis#0000
If you want to keep upgrading your HQ, you'll need to have your own A-fab line


[13-May-23 05:05 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
There are a lot more r-fab producers than there used to be, I used to get lots of request for r-fabs but not recently. I only have 3 PP3 and I don't intend to upgrade my HQ much more, maybe only the first 2 a-fab upgrades to also get those other two cheaper upgrades after them.


[13-May-23 05:06 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Besides I'm not really optimising for profit, I'm swapping to something else to keep it interesting


[13-May-23 05:09 PM] churavis#0000
As long as you don't need more than 20 permits to do it, then go for it. You can always build an A-fab line later if you need to.


[14-May-23 09:20 PM] archielvahr#0000

Would there be any interest in an RG or NG auction?


[07-Jun-23 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I would buy a couple hundred RG or ~50 NG


[07-Jun-23 12:50 PM] churavis#0000
How often?


[07-Jun-23 12:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
not often, like once every 3 weeks. This is RTA and ATA fabrication to balance out my outputs

[11-Jun-23 05:24 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Anyone have 4-500 FIM at a reasonable price?


[11-Jun-23 07:39 AM] churavis#0000
If they did they should do an auction so everyone can get an equal chance at it


[11-Jun-23 12:28 PM] martin1194#0000
what is your reasonable price? 1200?
(haven't FIM to sell yet. just ask ur reasonable price)


[11-Jun-23 04:35 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
12-1500 would be ok I think unless the cost to produce them has gone up significantly?


[11-Jun-23 04:37 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I need roughly 400 FIM/month on Griff, at 2500 each that is nearly half a million just on FIM


[11-Jun-23 08:00 PM] martin1194#0000
opps. i forgot FIM's price high to 2500.
last seen just 1400 at CX

ugh it's impossible to sell these Afabs


[14-Jun-23 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm up to 5mil in inventory...


[14-Jun-23 02:03 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Lots of people started making them, that's part of the reason I got out of Rfabs


[14-Jun-23 02:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, definitely not expanding their production any time soon. Guess once my HQ starts taking Afabs I'll be set


[14-Jun-23 02:07 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Also when I need afabs I tend to ask Churaviis first as his prices are much lower


[14-Jun-23 02:19 PM] churavis#0000
I use all my extra Afabs for HQ upgrades


[14-Jun-23 02:19 PM] allocater#0000
there will be a lot a fab demand when the new building releases I think


[14-Jun-23 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
There's also going to be new demand for LIT where there was none before and I'll be the only one with inventory on the exchange


[14-Jun-23 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I got the vibe that the new building will only take afabs in the initial construction, but it miight take some for each level


[14-Jun-23 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been stockpiling for that


[14-Jun-23 03:23 PM] churavis#0000
I wondered about that as well. Is anyone on the test server that can confirm that?

I have 54 on deimos, though I think churaviis buys it sometimes


[15-Jun-23 07:16 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I assume he just uses it for CQS. I will take it all if available. As a sweetener I have 50 ZR on Griff available, I don't have a price though.


[15-Jun-23 07:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll buy it for 8k, same as I do W. 😄


[15-Jun-23 07:20 PM] hernanduer#0000

[18-Jul-23 04:24 PM] higgsy#0000
Hey, me too!


[18-Jul-23 05:12 PM] exeler#0000
I can make everything except KOM. Let me know how much you want and I'll tell you how long it'll take. I've got some of those on hand usually, but I've not restocked them in a while. 

I have a whole base full of BMP so I'm pretty confident I can make waaaay more than you need.


[18-Jul-23 11:14 PM] sage42#0000
I’m say what I need the most is OVE and PWO, I consume about 1 per day at max of the other ressources.


[19-Jul-23 12:55 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
FYI: KOM at 500/u on the CX is actually a cheap price.


[19-Jul-23 01:31 AM] melon164#0000

That is remarkably stable


[19-Jul-23 09:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think Gravy made a very consious effort to set the price at 500


[19-Jul-23 09:39 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
There's a whole thread on the game discord at the beginning of this year where Gravy declared himself the saviour of KOM - he'd torn down his empire and re-jigged everything to only produce KOM. He also declared that the "fair" price of KOM was 500/u and that was gonna be his price. Considering the price at the time was around 800-1k, this caused some comment.


[19-Jul-23 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
If he wants to make KOM, my FERs can make something else. I'll buy his cheap KOM, i'm okay with that, heh


[19-Jul-23 09:41 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I'm sad the price of WIN fell so suddenly.


[19-Jul-23 03:52 PM] higgsy#0000
Ok, after doing a linear differential multivariate topology regression analysis on my bidirectional parallel matrix machine learning model, I'm looking to buy:

3380 OVE
1340 PWO
1700 KOM
800 EXO
330 REP
800 PT
480 ALE
240 MED
50 SC
240 HMS
50 SCN

I'm gonna go say bye bye to my money now.


[19-Jul-23 03:57 PM] melon164#0000
That looks like an awful lot of OVE


[19-Jul-23 03:58 PM] melon164#0000
and even more PWO


[19-Jul-23 03:58 PM] melon164#0000
I consume 20 PWO and 40 OVE a day over 18 bases...


[19-Jul-23 04:12 PM] exeler#0000
Don't listen to him. I'll happily sell you that much OVE and PWO 😄

I started a ton of auctions for a bunch of random goods I've been stockpiling for a while. I realized I hadn't flown Harmonia->ANT in a loooong time when I took over 500 CAF and 3 separate faction contracts in one go.

Tons of CL, PWO, EPO, and NS available too


[18-Aug-23 11:54 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have some DDT on ANT I no longer plan to use if anyone wants some. I landed some of it from Erix retirement, so some of it is free if you are actually going to use it. Otherwise, I'll just move it on the CX.


[18-Aug-23 12:29 PM] melon164#0000
I've switched to making HER on Demeter which is overconsuming my DDT, so I'd appreciate some 🤷‍♂️

how much more?


[18-Aug-23 01:18 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have a hundred more after what I have sent you already, send me a contract for a ridiculously steep discount on it... you choose. That will clean me out of what all that I had on hand.


[18-Aug-23 01:20 PM] melon164#0000

Some smart-ass has decided to manipulate the RAT market. They've put up a 200k buy at  158 AIC...


[21-Aug-23 01:47 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
that's a great way for losing money and hurting the newer players, imho.


[21-Aug-23 01:57 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah agreed.


[21-Aug-23 02:01 PM] churavis#0000
If it was something like water that would be easy enough to ramp up production of in a week or two but it's difficult to ramp up agricultural products.

{Reactions}
💯 

[21-Aug-23 02:02 PM] domicius#0000
And at 20k units, there's no way its going anywhere.


[21-Aug-23 02:09 PM] dehzhas#0000
I do think part of the hurt to new players is the fact that the starts are static and not in line with current exchange rates. So the higher consumables are, the worse hit they take while working with low cash flow.


[21-Aug-23 02:10 PM] dehzhas#0000
Also the intro MM keep prices on things like bfabs artificially low and the new players get squeezed.


[21-Aug-23 02:11 PM] dehzhas#0000
If MM expired after a certain amount of universe maturity or age, all that would happen is prices would adjust and inflation would occur.


[21-Aug-23 02:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
As it is, players can generate epic amounts of cash with no where to spend it and the system has fixed bits in place so that new players are even slower than they already are

[21-Aug-23 02:18 PM] dehzhas#0000
I will say, I have mixed feelings about this one in particular. I'm about to be the top RAT producer in the galaxy by a good margin... so I will make bank while it lasts.


[21-Aug-23 02:53 PM] domicius#0000
And I have enough money that I don't care. However newer players don't quite have that luxury...


[21-Aug-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
unless the new players are making RATs!


[21-Aug-23 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a net cost of $1.5 mil you could buy 182,000 RAT at the MM price and sell them to Swanada at 158/u


[21-Aug-23 04:30 PM] dehzhas#0000
What's the MM for RAT?


[21-Aug-23 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
$166


[21-Aug-23 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
which really isn't that much money to leave someone else holding the bag of something like 32 mil of RATs purchased at 158/u


[21-Aug-23 04:33 PM] dehzhas#0000
oh... wow... so, dump 6 mil into thin air and cost Swanada something 100+ mil to keep up with your 6 mil

{Reactions}
🤔 

[21-Aug-23 04:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you wanted to do other exchanges perhaps yeah


[21-Aug-23 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Presumably the rats will make it back on to the market eventually (perhaps at his loss)


[21-Aug-23 04:34 PM] dehzhas#0000
If he reposts, you do it again. As long as you can generate 6 mil faster than he can generate 100 mil, you win eventually


[21-Aug-23 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is gonna make a funny bump in the MM charts at the end of the month

[21-Aug-23 07:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
I Will say that unless a concerted effort is made to stop Swanada, he can probably keep this up indefinitely. And, I’d bet at a certain price point he makes a profit doing it for a long time until production volume significantly outpaces purchase volume.


[21-Aug-23 09:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well it seems like he hasn't re-upped his RAT orders on ANT, so I guess we got him 😉

You could try the /order command I added to the bot. I built it for exactly this kind of use case, but nobody has tested it yet and I'm looking for guinea pigs.


[14-Sep-23 12:17 AM] dehzhas#0000
Posted, will see how it goes. This will be super useful for larger volumes of rarer thinks like this.


[15-Sep-23 11:39 AM] dehzhas#0000
Putting up another HYF base, posted an order if anyone has any MHL available


[15-Sep-23 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am pretty tapped on HYF for a bit since I am making one too. I make like 40 a day and they are always in demand


[15-Sep-23 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Patiern makes some too though


[15-Sep-23 12:08 PM] churavis#0000
I'll be bringing back a bunch of Iodine from Aurum if anyone with a WEL wants to help make more


[15-Sep-23 12:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
honestly make like 5+ WELs


[15-Sep-23 01:03 PM] fremen45#0000
Do we have an I issue at all or just a WEL throughput issue?


[15-Sep-23 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I get my Iodine from Churavis and it's been working well for a while.


[15-Sep-23 03:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
@churavis what's the I price? I'll buy some and change my SSC production over to MHL


[15-Sep-23 04:07 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000

I am looking for EXO, KOM, or PT available on ANT looking for at most 100 of each. or on Griffonstone if people have spare there for some reason?


[21-Sep-23 04:00 PM] churavis#0000

KOM is actually one of the most reasonably priced goods in the universe, the guy selling it barely makes a profit

[21-Sep-23 04:10 PM] hernanduer#0000

thanks for the Heads up in that case I'll get it from the CX.

O, I, and SIO auction up, get it before lack of space forces me to end the auctions early


[29-Sep-23 12:51 PM] exeler#0000
A lack of space on ANT?! 😱


[29-Sep-23 12:56 PM] churavis#0000
I mean, I could rent more by why do that when I can fill up your warehouses instead


[29-Sep-23 12:58 PM] domicius#0000
I think I have 33 warehouses on ANT


[29-Sep-23 12:59 PM] domicius#0000
100 actually 😲


[29-Sep-23 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm only at 80


[29-Sep-23 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe I need to step it up


[29-Sep-23 02:18 PM] domicius#0000
Honestly, I think I once just spent 5 mins to keep adding them. Useful as I ship FE, LST,  et,


[29-Sep-23 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
Everytime I break down and add more it ends up super empty afterwards for a while so I feel dumb.


[29-Sep-23 02:27 PM] churavis#0000
Did everyone get enough oxygen or should I bring another?


[29-Sep-23 02:28 PM] churavis#0000
Full loads, carrier or otherwise, are also available at a discount if you pick it up from Etherwind yourself.


[29-Sep-23 03:04 PM] domicius#0000
Etherwind is a hassle to get to.


[29-Sep-23 03:04 PM] domicius#0000

I'll pick it all up for the Corp, ship to ANT. Let me know what's left and I'll put up some contracts.


[03-Feb-24 08:45 AM] domicius#0000

If you end up with more NR than you can use in a reasonable amount of time, I'll take a few 1000

[04-Feb-24 02:11 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I now have a base with 11k storage there + 3T ship parked. What is left on this base?


[06-Feb-24 06:54 AM] rune_242#0000

We could probably flog that PE to PiBoy for a healthy price


[10-Feb-24 01:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use a lot of PE on connectors too. maybe not 500k lol


[10-Feb-24 02:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I would take some to turn into BDE, but definitely not 500k 😄


[10-Feb-24 02:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Put me at the end of the line though - I don’t actually have any PP1 or PP2 at the moment


[10-Feb-24 02:28 PM] churavis#0000

3600+ on KI-439b. free if you pick it up there


[07-Jun-24 11:47 AM] melon164#0000
🤔 how much surplus LIO do you make?


[07-Jun-24 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
It seems that I make 442.3 / Day, and I guess technically I could use as much as 180/d of that.


[07-Jun-24 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
It seems like I use less than that though.


[07-Jun-24 11:50 AM] churavis#0000
I make plenty of excess LI

Doesn’t he know


[08-Sep-24 01:06 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i contacted him ingame inquiring on his reasons.

if it is the same guy that tried to do this several weeks ago, then he doesn't grasp how the market works.


[08-Sep-24 02:49 PM] zipatsu#0000
Noticed that he bought all my H2O and listed it for more yeah 😅


[08-Sep-24 02:50 PM] akyantor#0000
That's a very high volume good to try and corner the market on :S


[08-Sep-24 02:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
What was the previous price at, 31?


[08-Sep-24 02:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can start listing my water at that price


[08-Sep-24 02:53 PM] turlorn_angren#0000

Which reminds me - @akyantor, you’re welcome to send for the difference between that and whatever I filled your order at. I meant to tell you 80 was good


[08-Sep-24 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
It seems like demand for RATs is higher in corp than FIM, so I’m almost exclusively making rats in the meantime


[08-Sep-24 03:21 PM] akyantor#0000
Cool, thanks. Plowing all the money into AWH prep. 😛


[08-Sep-24 03:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I'll definitely be a regular buyer of FIM now with some of these more complex buildings.


[08-Sep-24 03:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, there’s gonna be a balance there in terms of FIM production. I’ll have tons of extra HER though if someone wants to make a bunch of their own in the meantime


[08-Sep-24 03:27 PM] akyantor#0000
I suspect my demand will still be fairly modest compared to older players. I think it'll just be for the 3xAML I've recently setup.


[08-Sep-24 07:00 PM] zipatsu#0000
Had the prices stable across 3 CX's for a good while but with the recent surge of players buying it to flip for more I can't keep the price low anymore without enough stock to scare them off trying to do that. Quite happy with how long I've been able to keep it flat between the current price and the previous disruption I've gotten close to a year of stability on them.

I do feel bad for the players that have gotten used to the prices being low and if it were up to me they'd stay low but I'm not making that much profit by doing this so it takes a fair bit of time to save up the credits needed for afabs and then hoping it can somehow get filled in corp too as the quantities of afabs necessary per new 3 permit base are getting beyond the CX supply at this point 😅

[08-Sep-24 07:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, it's been nice knowing exactly what the price of water will be 😄


[08-Sep-24 07:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
but at least this way you can get some better margins out of it


[08-Sep-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect Blake only picked 34.90 because Hern has 120k H2O at 35, so if @hernanduer  puts his water up at 34.8 instead of 35, that might send a fun message to Blake about buying out the market


[08-Sep-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Blake is also making a buy order at 31 to try to widen his spread


[08-Sep-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh this Blake guy is xepiov, the one who runs on every planet for governor


[08-Sep-24 08:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
he has a reputation for not replying regarding governor issues


[08-Sep-24 08:39 PM] archielvahr#0000

[08-Sep-24 08:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
Nothing like taking up an MP seat to do nothing 🙄


[08-Sep-24 08:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can also list my stuff at 34.8. I only have about 20k, but I like the message 😄


[09-Sep-24 08:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
I had to buy 40 new warehouses to fit it


[09-Sep-24 08:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
but I can relist it for fun


[09-Sep-24 08:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's almost 5mil worth of water


[09-Sep-24 08:57 AM] zipatsu#0000
At least the people will know who to blame for the price increasing on Ant 🤷
