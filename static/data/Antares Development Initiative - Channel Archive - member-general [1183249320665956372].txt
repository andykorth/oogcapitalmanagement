@cleavingambiguity @sidepipe I sent you both a corporation invite through PU, feel free to accept it or ignore it - mostly just for decoration.


[10-Dec-23 01:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although in the future it could provide beneficial if we end up with a Corp HQ.

If I may interject, as a meer simpleton point of view, I don't think *this* Corp would interfere with you joining any other solely due to the fact that this is not a competitive Corp (so to speak) unlike gtu and the like, this is founded, and project admins please cite me here, this is founded on the premise of assisting players and allowing a point of meeting/common grounds to plan, get help etc. Not so much as a physical Corp that vies for the status quo, however once again that is solely my understanding and @Project Administrator can kak me out if I got something wrong


[10-Dec-23 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
And most corps don't really require you to be in a in-game Corp, e.g. I'm in GTU but have my own Corp, that's more a hq bonus thing at this stage in the games development


[10-Dec-23 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
And gov thing


[10-Dec-23 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
The idea of the in-game corporation was just a matter of decoration and aesthetics, I liked the idea of having people within a corporation, there was meant to be no pressure whatsoever to join and it was just a nice to have, if that makes sense. This corporation is definitely not a competitive one, merely a assistance program for not only Antares as a whole but for new players.


[10-Dec-23 02:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Join it or not - option is there and it'll probably remain, but ultimately it is just that - decoration. ^^

[10-Dec-23 02:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ultimately you could take my money and run with it and I wouldn't hold it against you - as long as someone was helped somewhere down the line, I feel like a goal was accomplished, even however small.

@Deleted User - are you still offering ship upgrades to new players?

Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be saying this so soon, but 500t just isn‚Äôt enough anymore üòÑ

I'm assuming you want the full upgrade or just a WCB?


[25-Dec-23 04:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Full upgrade. Is it still 600k?

Yes please. Where are you ordering them to? I‚Äôve got ships at ANT but I can rent a warehouse if needed. Want me to just send you a CONT for 600k?

@sidepipe  There is a large delay with SSC and LHP so depending on when the rest arrives you may have to buy it (LHP and SSC) from cx and then just put what I give you (LHP and SSC) up for sale when it arrives ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you want I can get you another WCB? *for the second ship*


[26-Dec-23 05:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's okay - I'm not super liquid right now. Will need to sell a few rounds of rations to buy the LHP for the first ship


[26-Dec-23 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can give you back the money for it?


[26-Dec-23 06:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's okay, I've got a bunch of stuff going to the CX in the next few days. I just meant that I wouldn't have the money to pay for the second WCB atm since I'm grabbing LHP and SSC from the CX.

@havanista hey, is there a reason you don't read/respond to the planet chat of the planet you're currently running for governor on (LS-746b)? people have issues with what you're doing and it's kind of odd to ignore them for months and just keep running for governor. especially when others are currently running for governor to try and fix things and you're contesting their election

Hmm.


[25-Mar-24 06:06 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeeeaaahhh... not sure what's going on there but he's clearly not filling anything. Rog reached out to me about it too cause the planet is *super* tiny, like 3 people there and one is KAWA. Do they just... not know how gov upkeep works?


[25-Mar-24 06:06 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Cause I can happily help with that


[25-Mar-24 06:07 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That's like, my whole companies thing


[25-Mar-24 06:08 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I can even ship the mats in if you need them virtual


[25-Mar-24 02:27 PM] havanista#0000
nothing to respond, i spended the money doing programs, and people fleeing this planet....what i can say to him


[25-Mar-24 02:27 PM] havanista#0000
if he think he can do better than he will see


[25-Mar-24 02:28 PM] havanista#0000
if he complains to you, then complain what to do


[25-Mar-24 02:30 PM] havanista#0000
i'm not going to waste my monet more in this planet, indeed i will dismantle everything than put it worst if i'm not elected that's it


[25-Mar-24 02:30 PM] havanista#0000
because first when i talked there nobody responded  to me , so i did same


[25-Mar-24 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean, there's no open jobs there, so... as long as the COGC is getting filled, I'd be satisfied


[25-Mar-24 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Still, I think that's a pretty bad attitude to have as a governor.


[25-Mar-24 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'd step away and let Rog handle it if you don't feel up to it.


[25-Mar-24 02:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the complaint is was just that virtual is not actually the one filling the CoGC or anything else...


[25-Mar-24 02:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
if it's on programs that's something though. I'd just say that there's way cheaper ways to keep the population up then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[25-Mar-24 02:40 PM] havanista#0000
i did programs


[25-Mar-24 02:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's fair, those are pretty expensive though compared to a few OFF, and they don't help the CoGC, that still needs to be filled


[25-Mar-24 02:41 PM] havanista#0000
but that guys said befoire, there is nothing to be done in this planet, then now he suddenly compain because he put  10 dw on the CoGc lol


[25-Mar-24 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is more so he's been filling the COGC fully himself.


[25-Mar-24 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's not the job of the people on the planet, in reality.


[25-Mar-24 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
And from the sounds of it his complaint was also you raising taxes as well.


[25-Mar-24 02:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
there are people with bases and workers there though, so if you're going to run for governor then you're kind of expected to fill those needs


[25-Mar-24 02:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you're making tax income from people producing things, those people want the CoGC filled ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[25-Mar-24 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Regardless of POPI, COGC needs to be filled.


[25-Mar-24 02:44 PM] havanista#0000
cocg is like  2 dw it's cheap lol, somone was puytting e=it so i don't care


[25-Mar-24 02:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
COGC is definitely important


[25-Mar-24 02:44 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
then why run for governor


[25-Mar-24 02:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
And since that's the case.. he'd rather take over as governor instead, and his complaint was you ran against him despite seemingly not caring whatsoever for the planet.


[25-Mar-24 02:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you're just taking people's taxes and letting them fill stuff?


[25-Mar-24 02:45 PM] havanista#0000
oh my god


[25-Mar-24 02:45 PM] havanista#0000
i wait till ue stop to run program because feeding program was usless people sun away


[25-Mar-24 02:46 PM] havanista#0000
fedding porp is usless becaus epoepl ue unhappy and run away too


[25-Mar-24 02:46 PM] havanista#0000

[25-Mar-24 02:46 PM] havanista#0000
so well i dismantle the thing i have there better


[25-Mar-24 02:46 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
what. so why are you running for governor? that's all I'm really confused about?


[25-Mar-24 02:47 PM] havanista#0000
i was running for begining, just waiting pop get stabilized


[25-Mar-24 02:47 PM] havanista#0000

[25-Mar-24 02:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
for popi though, again the CoGC would still need filling. The point is: is you're insistent on not filling needs, but still running for governor, then you're just taking people's taxes for nothing right? if they want to fill things, let them have the taxes too


[25-Mar-24 02:50 PM] havanista#0000
a settler program is  25 k... it needs  2 weeks of full taxes to be paid....


[25-Mar-24 02:51 PM] havanista#0000
do u think those taxes gives a lot  per week ?


[25-Mar-24 02:51 PM] havanista#0000
thre are 2 people really active thereand two more lik eme so so


[25-Mar-24 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think all he was really asking is that the COGC be filled.


[25-Mar-24 02:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you don't need that many programs if you fill the OFF in the INF and SST, that's *way* cheaper


[25-Mar-24 02:53 PM] havanista#0000
one the most active player here i invited to my corp,  do u think he ever replyed to me ???

He said he was filling the CoGC before you even took governor though.


[25-Mar-24 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
4 months worth of it.


[25-Mar-24 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
And stopped after you took governor, since, y'know, that'd be your responsability.


[25-Mar-24 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
He even tried to talk to you about feeding it as well.


[25-Mar-24 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000

[25-Mar-24 02:59 PM] havanista#0000

[25-Mar-24 03:00 PM] havanista#0000

[25-Mar-24 03:01 PM] havanista#0000
gonna move somewhere else


[25-Mar-24 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Glad we came to.. some kind of resolution.. I guess.


[25-Mar-24 03:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah, I don't think anyone was trying to argue, just understand the situation. Filling CoGC is just kind of what a governor is supposed to do, so when you took over that's what people expected. If you don't want to be a governor though that's fine, nobody is trying to kick you off of the planet completely though, they just want the tax money for filling CoGC instead of running programs ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø no worries


[25-Mar-24 05:01 PM] havanista#0000

[27-May-24 01:46 PM] akyantor#0000
Is there any benefit to having the planet roles assigned on the server? *I see some folks have them assigned, but wondered if it mattered or not. It may be informational.*


[27-May-24 01:46 PM] flor2081#0000
nope, just helps other people identify on which popular planets you're based


[27-May-24 01:47 PM] flor2081#0000
gave you the roles üëç


[27-May-24 01:47 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't really like them though cause they don't cover a lot of planets. kinda pointless if you need to open a CO buffer anyways


[27-May-24 01:47 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah true


[27-May-24 01:48 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, would tend to agree, unless it was setup so folks could maintain them themselves, to avoid them getting out of date.


[27-May-24 01:49 PM] akyantor#0000
That said, easy enough to check in game.


[27-May-24 01:49 PM] jvaler#0000
that'd involve bots so i doubt it'll happen

GTU has a pretty easy-to-use thing like that


[27-May-24 01:50 PM] flor2081#0000
it's easy if you need something at a planet you can just tag the role


[27-May-24 01:52 PM] akyantor#0000
Is the AGP role for folks who've received funding, or for folks providing funding?


[27-May-24 01:53 PM] flor2081#0000
recieved i think


[27-May-24 01:56 PM] jvaler#0000
both, cause i have the role


[27-May-24 02:02 PM] evany.#0000
i think its just used for the #agp channels


[27-May-24 02:03 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah, that'd explain why I can't post in some of those channels. Not that I've had need to.


[27-May-24 02:04 PM] evany.#0000
yeah that would be why. i can post in both not that i did anything special to receive the role

[27-May-24 02:19 PM] evany.#0000
fairly confident i got the role long before that though


[27-May-24 02:24 PM] akyantor#0000
I think it's mixed. I haven't the role, and looking back some, have some haven't, based upon the names in grant posts in #agp-information, which is why I wondered.


[27-May-24 02:26 PM] akyantor#0000
Would like to build up enough that I could give grants in the future. I suspect that'll take months.


[27-May-24 02:29 PM] tanda#0000

[27-May-24 02:59 PM] akyantor#0000
I can see the temptation


[27-May-24 03:26 PM] jvaler#0000
well you needed the role to talk in the channel, so as long as you were planned to recieve a grant you had the role. basically just means AGP participants


[27-May-24 05:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000

It worked well when we had only a few people here and there wasn't much upkeep, but as expansion happened there became very little upkeep on it and it went out of service pretty much.


[28-May-24 07:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
The idea was people could request to either have their role created or to be given to them, it'd be fact checked and then applied.


[28-May-24 07:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Could've been integrated into the shipping program but that never really came to be, so otherwise they are decorative at best.


[28-May-24 07:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
When I made this server I had no idea it'd reach the scale it did, and so most of the layout is from a perception of few people.


[28-May-24 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
AGP role is for anyone who has either received funding, provides funding, or is in the process of receiving funds in the near future, E.G a new person to the server.

Pretty much every Project Member should have it and almost no Associates should.

As for this, that'll be because the sheet for AGP is no longer maintained and we opted for just posting it in the info channel instead.

[28-May-24 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Whoever is doing the funding should ideally check to ensure each member had the AGP role to give them it if not, but ultimately it doesn't change *that* much, just organisational benefits.


[28-May-24 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Looking back I realise some of this had been clarified already by the lovely coordinators but I just thought I'd clarify it from my standpoint as well.

what if instead of 'members' and 'associates' in the server we distinguished the 2 more clearly with CULT. Like, this is a group for anyone in the Antares region to come and get help, but the people who are more committed to this organization specifically and are part of the in-game corp get the CULT channels for planning and coordinating more serious bigger picture stuff


[28-May-24 07:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
idk, I'm just throwing out ideas


[28-May-24 07:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I really want to see CULT become something for those of you who started here in ADI and have really done some amazing stuff. Some have joined other corps but for those of you that want to strike out and do your own thing I'm here to support that


[28-May-24 07:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
is that PG project you're doing part of CULT, or just a general project?


[28-May-24 07:08 PM] jvaler#0000
the server was run by australis and got deleted when they left ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
it was dead in the water without them anyways


[28-May-24 07:10 PM] jvaler#0000
i felt like CULT was just becoming KAWA Antares Edition¬©Ô∏è with the internal market and vertical integration stuff. i'm personally not too interested in reviving it, but if others are i'm happy to make accomodations


[28-May-24 07:11 PM] jvaler#0000
that's separate from CULT


[28-May-24 07:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fair, but I think the separate server wasn't really working out anyway. I think you all met and started working together here, so you just kept doing that and the other server was forgotten. I think that making CULT somehow tied to ADI would almost make more sense and give it more purpose, so that it doesn't just become about the internal market stuff. Even if it's as simple as building a corp HQ somewhere and opening up the corp for anyone to join to get the bonus ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[28-May-24 07:14 PM] jvaler#0000
once activity in the server stopped it didn't resume over here. it just fizzled out altogether cause there weren't concrete plans, just preparations for plans


[28-May-24 07:15 PM] jvaler#0000
ooh HQ plan, that'd be interesting


[28-May-24 07:15 PM] jvaler#0000
who knows where though


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
anywhere that isn't a starting planet


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Nike? is that a starter?


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean where would be the best place for it üßê


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
there could be a place for an [ADI] corp for folks who haven't joined one yet


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] jvaler#0000
it is not, has a red bar


[28-May-24 07:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
Nike is a pretty good spot. Having the bonus for construction is really nice


[28-May-24 07:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
and it's a classic first expansion for Antares new players


[28-May-24 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
real and true


[28-May-24 07:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
and if the goal is to benefit Antares development, that would make sense


[28-May-24 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
i like the ADI corp tag but i don't wanna lose my catalytic core [CORE] tag üò≠


[28-May-24 07:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
is CORE just you? you can make it the CORE of antares üòÑ


[28-May-24 07:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
would be pretty funny seeing chat suddenly filled with [CULT] tags, lol


[28-May-24 07:18 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah CORE is just me running hermes. population 1(+1 corpse)


[28-May-24 07:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
do you have an HQ?


[28-May-24 07:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
every corp has one (corpse, not HQ)


[28-May-24 07:19 PM] jvaler#0000
not yet no. i've got the rfabs for it sitting at ANT, but i've been too indecisive to make a move


[28-May-24 07:19 PM] jvaler#0000
oh and i just realized an HQ on nike doesn't really benefit me cause my nike is in DNPC üòî


[28-May-24 07:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
bigger split? üòÜ


[28-May-24 07:20 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I would argue your case


[28-May-24 07:20 PM] jvaler#0000
don't think the sheet accounts for stuff like that


[28-May-24 07:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think it *could* pretty easily though.


[28-May-24 07:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
nobody seems to want to take over as coordinator, you just take over and increase your split by 10%, lol


[28-May-24 07:21 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah probably... though splits are still based on permits and not efficiency factor anyways so


[28-May-24 07:21 PM] jvaler#0000
oh no no no lmao. i just adopted a server, i'm not doing that


[28-May-24 07:21 PM] jvaler#0000
lmfao


[28-May-24 07:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
they're based on the assumption of 5 experts and both lux so efficiency is factored in somewhere


[28-May-24 07:22 PM] jvaler#0000
efficiency in material calculations yeah, but not in split payout

[28-May-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
so since construction costs aren't a factor and the HQ has no repairs, idk how it'd be factored in(or why üò¨)


[28-May-24 07:33 PM] jvaler#0000
sorry i think i'm being kinda argumentative


[28-May-24 07:33 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I was digging into the math on the sheet a while back and I feel like it would definitely be possible, and definitely *should* be possible. It even reduces split based on the amount of material actually being *used* by the project, so I'm only getting a split for like 18 of my 20 SME. If it can factor that in I think it could easily factor in a 10% increase in fab production (and at the same time also increase use AL so *we* would get a bigger split too...)


[28-May-24 07:33 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
no! you're good! I didn't read it that way at all


[28-May-24 07:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
either way, if we decide to do this and start a free corp for a bonus somewhere (Nike or Vulcan maybe?), then I can contribute the materials. I've been sitting on all the mats for months trying to decide where to build my own üòÜ Obviously I don't need my own private vila that bad and I'd rather it benefit more people than just me


[28-May-24 07:35 PM] jvaler#0000
wait what? i don't see where material output is factored into split %


[28-May-24 07:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it might not be, it's been a while and I'm probably misremembering. Let me look again


[28-May-24 07:36 PM] jvaler#0000
ooh vulcan i'm totally down for. gives me more wiggle room for my STL prod


[28-May-24 07:37 PM] jvaler#0000
or i can start up TI prod for rise again just a little bit


[28-May-24 07:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
also helps counter the expensive build cost there for newer players

cause FE/STL demand can't be *that* high


[28-May-24 07:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
in Antares? FE is pretty decent money...


[28-May-24 07:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
for a while sending FE from Moria to Antares was almost as profitable as sending AL from Antares to Moria, the weight just made it not worth it.


[28-May-24 07:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but yeah, hull plates are also great


[28-May-24 07:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
might be even better with the upcoming changes too


[28-May-24 07:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

4->5 with 30 buildings should take ~20 days. i don't know the particular production time of halcyon to calculate the % per order though. but if it's at 34.3% now it should be ~14 days until 5th expert

tbh, I'd agree, no need to wait until all 6 are available. Just randomly select the order, seems fair enough. *I'd be perfectly fine being last if that's the way it worked out using such a system.*

Not all grants are unrequited though. Some are paid back just like a loan and subject to qualifications

by definition a grant is something you don't pay back, right?

like for school, you don't pay back scholarships/grants


[16-Jun-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
for school there is grants yes. sometimes cities and federal grants do require repayment though. i got a grant from city of calgary in 2018 for 250k that ive had to repay like 40k a year, unlike a loan it doesnt accrue interest because its not for profit like a private entity

this doesn't actually affect people here like it does people in KAWA or AA, but just letting anyone who cares know that I'm going to be winding down most of my bases over the next month or so. Still around and doing some trading and coordinating and stuff on the social side of the game. I'll still be ~~ruling over~~ responsibly governing all of Benten as well. But I won't actually be making anything anymore. All bases will be demolished or converted to just storage ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø So if you want to take over my DNPC Deimos base let me know, I'll loan the materials

[29-Jun-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000
I think the main thing is increased cost per unit


[29-Jun-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Since there's static overhead mo matter if you're producing or not, for pop upkeep and building mx


[29-Jun-24 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
If you don't have a 25% reduction in time cost, that means you pay 33% more overhead compared to someone who has a reduction for the same output


[29-Jun-24 03:50 PM] jcheung#0000
The plus side is that you theoretically have to ship in feed stock less overall


[29-Jun-24 03:50 PM] jcheung#0000
The minus side... well, there's the aforementioned cost increase, you don't make as much in the same time so your profit goes down even ignoring static costs


[29-Jun-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Imo, if it reduces the logistical tail sufficiently, cogc be damned

[29-Jun-24 04:05 PM] igfloz#0000
makes sense, (in real world terms) refining ore removes everything but the metal. So 1T of AUO might make 0.5T of AU.
BUT 1 T of AU weighs more than 1T of AUO

Steel
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is one of the most commonly manufactured materials in the world. Steel is used in buildings, as concrete reinforcing rods, in bridges, infrastructure, tools, ships, trains, ...

so like I say, 1m^3 or ore cant get you 1m^3 of gold ? surely ??


[29-Jun-24 04:11 PM] jcheung#0000
AU input is 13.83t, 4m^3


[29-Jun-24 04:11 PM] jcheung#0000
AU output is 38.64t, 2m^3


[29-Jun-24 04:11 PM] igfloz#0000
ah, yeah, volume is smaller, weight is higher


[29-Jun-24 04:12 PM] jcheung#0000
And 1m^3 of that is carbon


[29-Jun-24 04:12 PM] igfloz#0000
C would be lost in the process


[29-Jun-24 04:13 PM] razenpok#0000
Ah, the fabled gold smelting process, the market maker of mass in this universe


[29-Jun-24 04:13 PM] razenpok#0000
This is weird af


[29-Jun-24 04:15 PM] jcheung#0000
Has that been brought up before?


[29-Jun-24 04:16 PM] razenpok#0000
Nothing shows up in the official discord with a "gold weight" or "au weight" query, so I think no


[29-Jun-24 04:16 PM] razenpok#0000
This should probably be reported, yea


[29-Jun-24 04:17 PM] jcheung#0000
I think there's gonna be some pissed off people who were relying on it üòÇ


[29-Jun-24 04:18 PM] razenpok#0000
*I think* the reason might be something like, "Gold is heavy IRL, so we are leaving the weight as it is right now. buttt if we make AUO heavier, people will stop shipping it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"


[29-Jun-24 04:19 PM] razenpok#0000
So, fun > realism


[29-Jun-24 04:19 PM] jcheung#0000
Obviously the solution then is to refine the AU in situ üòÇ

[29-Jun-24 04:20 PM] igfloz#0000
err, Actually, you get steel  by adding scrap steel and injecting Oxygen into raw Iron (in essence adding carbon to the raw iron)

Oh, sorry, I see you added more reference :S


[29-Jun-24 04:20 PM] razenpok#0000
Then people will be triggered because of the CoGC mismatch ü•¥


[29-Jun-24 04:21 PM] jcheung#0000
Clearly the thing to do then is to go all in and make it a fuel refining cogc


[29-Jun-24 04:51 PM] jvaler#0000
yup üò≠ 

the same thing happens with AU->BGO/RGO
so AUO gains mass twice when turning into BGO/RGO, it's so weird lmfao

~~and then i ship the BGO to ANT to sell to rise ;_;~~

[29-Jun-24 05:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Eh kinda, depends on the type of steel


[29-Jun-24 05:56 PM] jcheung#0000
I mean


[29-Jun-24 05:56 PM] jcheung#0000
High carbon steel is one step removed from wrought iron


[29-Jun-24 05:57 PM] jcheung#0000
Unless I'm misremembering


[29-Jun-24 05:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sometimes it‚Äôs about getting the right amount of carbon so you can get pearlite or martinsite


[29-Jun-24 05:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Usually wrought iron has less than 0.1% C in it


[29-Jun-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmm


[29-Jun-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
My memory must be failing me


[29-Jun-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
I thought wrought iron had more


[29-Jun-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Or was that cast


[29-Jun-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Yep. Cast iron is more


[29-Jun-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Oops


[29-Jun-24 06:02 PM] jcheung#0000
Ohhhhh. Whoops. Wrought iron is low carbon content, cast is high, steel is in the middle!


[29-Jun-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
And then there are alloys with other stuff that split from there

Basic oxygen process (BOP)
Basic oxygen process (BOP), a steelmaking method in which pure oxygen is blown into a bath of molten blast-furnace iron and scrap. The oxygen initiates a series of intensively exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions, including the oxidation of such impurities as carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and

It does happen, but you are generally correct. Production > Engineering needs (down time is very fluid)


[29-Jun-24 06:47 PM] igfloz#0000
..should be the reverse. Engineering should govern production time

Doesn't visibly make the moneys

lol, I mean fluid as in timeframe. planned maintenance could be week 32, but then in 10 days it's bumped to week 35, then week 47................ and you a re right, Engineering is Money spent, not money made

Anyhoo.... @avalock  - just to clarify. The product you posted appears to be 2.4GHz only - 2.4 GHz has a max capacity of 56 mbps bandwidth under ideal conditions. As a repeater, that will at least drop to 28 mbps (ideally) - Real world expectation (imho) 10 mbps. that's a pretty poor 1 meg connection üò¶

[08-Jul-24 01:38 AM] puncher23#0000
What do you all think of making an ANTARES channel in game.  I know we have discord but I think a fair few dont use it and it does resource hog on older pcs.   If we had an Antares in game chat with all the planets we could welcome new people and help instigate and assit with trades and shipping we miss out because no dicord or lack of want to join one.   I ask in here because Kawa is primarily in Ben space not Ant but I like Ant üôÇ


[08-Jul-24 04:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
That seems like more effort than it'd be worth.


[08-Jul-24 04:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, I see the applications behind it, but I think the effort outweighs any benefits.


[08-Jul-24 04:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
And I don't think there's been anyone who's complained about Discord taking up too many resources thus far.


[08-Jul-24 09:24 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok just spitballing


[09-Jul-24 05:48 PM] evany.#0000
i'd also point out that while i agree discord has slowly turned into bloated shit the last few years (yay capitalism) there is a web version that works fine (i use it everyday) 

i'd be kind of curious to know how many people use ingame chat.. honestly first time i thought of it was when the politics update came out and rise mentioned he was talking in one of the chats and it hit me that the game has ingame chat. personally have never used it


[09-Jul-24 06:04 PM] jcheung#0000
Is the web version lighter than the app?


[09-Jul-24 06:05 PM] jcheung#0000
I thought it was the other way around but i guess i didn't look


[09-Jul-24 06:11 PM] evany.#0000
they aren't really different to my knowledge (limited!) i haven't ever bothered to do much of a 'deep dive' on discord.

the discord app itself however is just a glorified browser to the same electron app

the web version of discord always felt slower and less responsive, but i have no proof of it lol


[09-Jul-24 07:24 PM] evany.#0000
i wouldn't argue that in a heartbeat. undoubtedly your right since you get another abstraction layer (the browser of choice) and its less feature-rich (both to push adoption of their app so you buy more useless shit, and technical debt in general)

i constantly underestimate how much development time it takes for 'finish' tasks like highlighting ui elements you mouse over, gracefully swapping the chat window when switching channels for ease of access and dozens of other widgets emotes gifs and image loads and rendering just to name a few!

i'd put money down that your right as half those things in a browser require page loads and frame management that the app wouldn't be held to do

[25-Jul-24 10:40 PM] jcheung#0000
maybe not by half though, since your feedstock is being mined on planet


[25-Jul-24 10:40 PM] jcheung#0000
i would keep like 100k in reserve though, maybe bring EXTs up to max


[25-Jul-24 10:40 PM] tanda#0000
the second plan is a good idea honestly. That gives you cash to supply your base population for a week or two


[25-Jul-24 10:40 PM] xtc69#0000
what is max ?


[25-Jul-24 10:41 PM] tanda#0000
though yeah, EXTs are cheap, drop them first and sell your excess on LM


[25-Jul-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
plan 1. 5 of them


[25-Jul-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000

just depends on how much money you have and what's a comfortable buffer to you


[27-Jul-24 04:40 PM] xtc69#0000
i got 600k left so was thinking 10 days to give me buffer

[28-Jul-24 03:00 PM] flor2081#0000
on the left it says "developed / avail / total" so that means theres 198 available out of the 500


[28-Jul-24 03:00 PM] xtc69#0000
is it because i have not belt my STO ?

Sometimes spreads can be really high and ideally you are not only selling to buy orders but always analyze the markets

easiest way to use a supply cart would be to use the XIT Burn command from PMMG

I dont use that i just manually calc off the Delta per day it gives

so far got that to work


[28-Jul-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
the way I have mine set up, it will turn red when under 5 days supply, yellow when under 15, and the "amt needed" column will be 15 days buffer on top of that


[28-Jul-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
so my "amt needed" column shows me what I need to bulk back up to a 30 days supply

would you also be interested in any TIO?


[29-Jul-24 07:56 PM] tanda#0000
I don't have a path for TIO or TI usage currently. About the only thing I can do after I smelt it is sell it


[29-Jul-24 07:57 PM] jcheung#0000
i might be in a month or so...


[29-Jul-24 07:57 PM] finestone#0000
Im just going have alot of excess TIO here soon before i can get my smelter base maxed out


[29-Jul-24 07:58 PM] finestone#0000
doesnt really matter to me ill be selling TI and TIO on CX


[29-Jul-24 07:59 PM] finestone#0000
TIO or TI or both


[29-Jul-24 08:00 PM] jcheung#0000
possibly both, not certain. i have some loose plans but it relies on some things going well in the near future


[29-Jul-24 08:01 PM] finestone#0000
Understood well let me know! Ill probably end up posting in Internel offers once everything up and running so look there!


[29-Jul-24 08:02 PM] finestone#0000
after that i have a software setup so im planned up for a bit üòÑ


[29-Jul-24 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
about the only thing I could really think to do with TI would be to start feeding an ASM to make AST and FET


[29-Jul-24 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
which I've looked at before, but kinda dismissed


[29-Jul-24 08:06 PM] finestone#0000
Interesting I currently only have plans to sell the TI


[29-Jul-24 08:07 PM] finestone#0000
Then SD for (SAL/LD) then maybe AML for TAI processing and producing SC


[29-Jul-24 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
fet was on my radar üòÖ


[29-Jul-24 08:08 PM] jcheung#0000
gonna be expensive as shit tho


[29-Jul-24 08:29 PM] finestone#0000
I did think of producing SEQ but don't really think demand is there


[29-Jul-24 09:00 PM] finestone#0000
@tanda any thoughts on those future outputs?


[29-Jul-24 09:16 PM] tanda#0000
unfortunately my experience does not include AML and most SD products


[29-Jul-24 09:16 PM] tanda#0000
but I think unless you had a dedicated supply contract with someone to buy your outputs you might struggle to sell some of those


[29-Jul-24 09:16 PM] tanda#0000
except SC


[29-Jul-24 09:17 PM] finestone#0000
I have a buyer for the SAL/LD

build warehouses on every single planet in ANT space

[02-Aug-24 12:55 AM] jvaler#0000
the WCB item is the 3000t/1000m^3 cargo bay itself, but we use "kit" to refer to all the items required to upgrade a starter ship into a ship that uses said WCB cargo bay.

yeah the wait times are just too long for this many people


[02-Aug-24 09:35 AM] akyantor#0000
I wouldn't say it's a disaster if that's the reason. It's made the upgrades more accessible to folks who may otherwise have waited as it feels a bit more complicated sourcing them outside the ADI community.

{Reactions}

[02-Aug-24 09:36 AM] jvaler#0000
these technically are sourced from outside ADI lol


[02-Aug-24 09:36 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, but not to the end recipients, they're working with folks they know from within ADI


[02-Aug-24 09:36 AM] jvaler#0000
it would have been so much simpler for me to just give people loans to buy the kits themselves

[03-Aug-24 07:23 AM] evany.#0000
Your getting pounced on jvaler but it‚Äôs been my experience that anything ship wise has taken three weeks longer to source than the expected 2+ weeks to source, it seems like ships are just generally hard as hell to get your hands on


[03-Aug-24 07:24 AM] evany.#0000
In that respect I think your the only person surprised or feels it underperforming, I don‚Äôt obviously like having to order things five or six weeks early, but having done it three times now, it seems to be the norm


[03-Aug-24 01:12 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that perspective seems about right actually


[03-Aug-24 01:13 PM] jvaler#0000
but that makes me think energy would be better spent working on in-house prod instead of managing all this finance and contract bs


[03-Aug-24 01:18 PM] tanda#0000

[03-Aug-24 02:41 PM] tanda#0000
honestly I gave up after looking at what it costs to do LFE. Literally just told myself to do something more attainable like WCB production


[03-Aug-24 02:42 PM] jcheung#0000
Well. I think it wouldn't be too bad if the goal is to just get a line running, period. Ignore the inefficiencies from not running at 100% at the start.


[03-Aug-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Also i think we could probably get started by seeing if rise would be available to integrate his fabs


[03-Aug-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
And if yes, then start off by negotiating about filling things he's short on to have higher fab uptime-i know FET is one of his items needed, for example, but he also has a price structure that doesn't look at the CX


[03-Aug-24 02:45 PM] realharvey#0000
its not about the price at all


[03-Aug-24 02:45 PM] realharvey#0000
its just so many items you have to handle


[03-Aug-24 02:45 PM] realharvey#0000
since nothing can really be supplied from cx in enoug quantity


[03-Aug-24 02:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure


[03-Aug-24 02:49 PM] jcheung#0000
I think you could still get started with smaller projects that involve filling the gaps in rise's capabilities, and then once that's filled, to move on to the next higher assembly


[03-Aug-24 03:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
how about filling up CX with intermediate first? Yeah there will be no sales but it will help to stockpile some components when project starts moving


[03-Aug-24 03:07 PM] tanda#0000
honestly I only brought up making WCBs in house because jvaler expressed that doing these contracts was a huge hassle


[03-Aug-24 03:07 PM] tanda#0000
it's still a huge hassle to do them in house, but only during initial setup


[03-Aug-24 03:50 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I'd be very interested in helping in anyway that could on a shipbuilding project


[03-Aug-24 03:52 PM] realharvey#0000
if we cant really sell it, we'll have running costs but no profit. Not sure how long we can sustain it


[03-Aug-24 03:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
Maybe Government can step in and buy them?


[03-Aug-24 03:56 PM] realharvey#0000
rise probably could


[03-Aug-24 03:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
overwise it has to be at the loss for a while until market can afford buying it


[03-Aug-24 03:56 PM] realharvey#0000
if no one takes it we are talking about 3-5 weeks at a loss


[03-Aug-24 03:58 PM] realharvey#0000

for the production ?


[03-Aug-24 04:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
this has been an ongoing discussion and a big part of the complications trying to start a full shipbuilding operation in KAWA. We started by building the bases that could produce profitable outputs right away. Like building a full base of PPFs but starting them out on just PSL during the CX spike ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø selling off those things funded the rest of the bases until we recently finally started producing full ships. We're still at way less than the full capacity planned, but now we can sell full ships slowly to fund even more growth to fill out the production chain. It was way trickier to plan that expected but a fun puzzle


[03-Aug-24 04:03 PM] realharvey#0000
how long did it take you to get it rolling?


[03-Aug-24 04:04 PM] realharvey#0000
and how many bases are involved?


[03-Aug-24 04:04 PM] realharvey#0000
once your production went for a few cycles it will also show the required ressources for those


[03-Aug-24 04:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we started planning for the project back in February after Carcissia stopped playing (they ran 33 bases making full ships for KAWA by themselves...) First bases went up maybe a month later, capacity to build full ships (only technically and very slowly) hit almost a month ago


[03-Aug-24 04:06 PM] xtc69#0000

You murderer of real estate


[03-Aug-24 04:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the tiles tucked away to either side of the CXOS/FLT area are WH (for adding units when needed) and FXPO (for exchanging CIS for whatever currency the CX is)


[03-Aug-24 04:49 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
üòÜ only for prox. Most of my bases are just new order tiles there. And that one I've been meaning to get rid of to extend the workforce tile but I'm lazy

when I was at 14 bases, I had 23:
- 14 for bases
- 4 for CXs
- landing screen with some basic info at load up
- contract screen with LMOS and CONTS/COND and stuff
- a screen for government stuff
- an almost full page map screen with PLI and some empty tiles down one side for research
- and this beauty: burn üî• (it had more before I started downsizing...)

in the last couple months I probably spent 80% of my time in-game on just that screen... just burn tiles and inventory tiles for my main hubs. Then I've got FLT and INV buttons on the left bar as well so I could basically run everything from this screen except LM/CX trading


[03-Aug-24 04:57 PM] razenpok#0000
I find it fascinating that everyone is building out their own UI workflow in this game


[03-Aug-24 04:58 PM] tanda#0000
it's definitely interesting to see so many different solutions to the same problems

real life is kicking my ass a bit üòÖ so I'm shutting down all but one of my bases to reduce the daily tasks needed to keep up my empire. Now I do more project coordinating, trading, and corp funding management. Instead of producing things, I just throw money at other people to produce it, lol. I like the social elements of this game a lot though. So I just cut out the things that were burning me out and instead do more of the stuff I like while also reducing commitment to the game that I can't really affort atm ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

yea just trying to get above my starting cost was 750k want to see my money at 1m first lol


[11-Aug-24 04:40 PM] xtc69#0000
how much is new planted worth might need to be my next thing


[11-Aug-24 04:41 PM] xtc69#0000
sorry new base on a planted


[11-Aug-24 04:41 PM] tanda#0000
depends a lot on the planet. A Nike base will run you over a mil (not that bad), a Harmonia base is like 800k, and Nascent is around 600k to 1.2m depending on what you do there


[11-Aug-24 06:27 PM] xtc69#0000
aww yeah i barley have 600k to my name should wait a bit right ?


[11-Aug-24 06:56 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, you'll want to have about double that, or set up two not full bases to get started with


[11-Aug-24 06:56 PM] tanda#0000
gotta keep in mind that you'll need consumables as well


[11-Aug-24 06:57 PM] xtc69#0000
yea why i need to keep doing what i am doing for month or so


[12-Aug-24 06:21 AM] realharvey#0000
growth in this game will always be kinda slow. Even when you have better cash flow. And some point you'll have to wait for ships to be produced etc. to grow further. Or permits get super expensive


[12-Aug-24 06:21 AM] realharvey#0000
but its all fun and part of the big process of revenue number go up :D


[12-Aug-24 09:35 AM] xtc69#0000
yeah haha can not wait to start making ships going to be a min lol

That depends on what you upgrade it to. But repairs are pretty cheap anyway


[21-Aug-24 07:03 PM] marat_sh#0000

There is no fuel refining COGC planet in Antares space, right? I think whoever is in charge of EOS in Antares I should make that a fuel refining specialty planet. It's already got the galerite. don't need another electronics planet

[03-Sep-24 10:30 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Dont farm carbon on Harmonia. Expand to Nascent, make carbon there. 

But otherwise, some mix of farm and INC presumably?

[09-Sep-24 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
but phobos is mainly used for EDC IDC
in short, we need another ELECTRONICS planets, closer to the CX


[09-Sep-24 11:01 AM] laaxus#0000
We're gonna need one whole new planet for electronics, the closest one after phobos is 4 distance away, which seems far

so, the purpose of this post


[09-Sep-24 11:01 AM] laaxus#0000
should we consider starting a new electronic planet, shorter to the cx ?


[09-Sep-24 11:01 AM] laaxus#0000
if so, increasing the population will take time, so we should start sooner than later

Any of y‚Äôall feel like organizing a joint effort to build a gateway on Deimos or Phobos? Even just providing a spreadsheet where players preemptively contribute would be helpful. Seems like an ADI/CULT project


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] laaxus#0000
that's kinda what I'm thinking about


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] laaxus#0000
a gateway would be a huge economic boon


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] laaxus#0000
if it brings planets 4 distance away, to two


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] pi3142718#0000
Depends if we can build them in faction space I guess‚Ä¶


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] pi3142718#0000
Either way there will be somewhere in ANT we want a gateway


[09-Sep-24 11:53 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
and for a gateway, we need a fuck ton of sp


[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
but most phobos base are IDC/EDC


[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
therefore we need a new electr planet, not that far from the cx

[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
but we need time to populate that planet


[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
so let's start it soon


[09-Sep-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
and I suggested one of those 4

what's wrong with EOS?


[09-Sep-24 12:07 PM] laaxus#0000
TSH


[09-Sep-24 12:07 PM] laaxus#0000
high temp is very expensive, not worth


[09-Sep-24 12:11 PM] tanda#0000
Depending on what else is available, it might be the best bet. One red is always less expensive than two red


[09-Sep-24 12:12 PM] tanda#0000
and TSH production and demand are going to increase a LOT. 1200 for the base gateway


[09-Sep-24 12:12 PM] laaxus#0000
Wouldn't any of those be better ?

both is pretty expancive

Eos is SEA and TSH so it's going to be pretty close.


[09-Sep-24 12:17 PM] tanda#0000
After that you need to look at population levels: "does this planet have the pop I need or can it grow to accommodate within a reasonable time frame"


[09-Sep-24 12:20 PM] laaxus#0000
In short, it does not matter the slightest

[09-Sep-24 12:20 PM] laaxus#0000
so EOS might actually work ?


[09-Sep-24 12:21 PM] tanda#0000
Then it comes down to the issue of pop. TECH basically mandates Eos, which already has an established tech pop base

Technically you are allowed to make something other than EDC or IDC on Phobos

And there's Malahat and Jeetiyu. I can speak for Malahat: tech employment would be extremely appreciated there, because it helps grow engineers


[09-Sep-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you wanna make that base you linked at Malahat, I'll throw you 2m AIC


[09-Sep-24 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000
honestly, after running the numbers, we might not need a new planet


[09-Sep-24 12:45 PM] laaxus#0000
one base could supply the whole requirement for SP in a month

TSH is what I'm immediately worried about. Current market prices make that nealy 25% of the gateway price. And I'm pretty sure there's next to no volume on it since it competes with afabs

Where and how much volume?


[09-Sep-24 04:52 PM] laaxus#0000

[09-Sep-24 04:52 PM] laaxus#0000
I can provide 30k a day


[09-Sep-24 04:53 PM] pi3142718#0000
Depends on the TI supply


[09-Sep-24 04:53 PM] pi3142718#0000
1 base is enough to make a gateway‚Äôs worth of PSH in 25 days


[09-Sep-24 04:53 PM] pi3142718#0000
So I‚Äôd probably only convert 2 bases at max


[09-Sep-24 04:55 PM] pi3142718#0000
10.5k/day/base, so 21k/day if I can get 100 TI/day


[09-Sep-24 04:56 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd be able to supply you then, when the time come


[09-Sep-24 04:56 PM] pi3142718#0000

@laaxus You're going to have to send the sell contract. I can't pick up from a buy in a ship and 70k NFI is more than fits in the Phobos warehouse

@pi3142718 I sarted NFI production, do you want to buy it already ?


[11-Sep-24 08:19 PM] pi3142718#0000
Yes, send over the contracts


[12-Sep-24 07:05 AM] tanda#0000
~~My own thoughts on the matter is that I can pay 125/unit on BRM which gives you a stable income from that base of about 56k per day, and an ROI of about 17 days~~


[12-Sep-24 07:08 AM] tanda#0000
Or I can give you a third of the REA produced, which should retail upwards of 690 per unit. Now technically that's more money but I expect this product to do a lot of sitting. It moves on the CXs in batches of 1-2k or more every 3-4 days and there's very limited supply as it is right now.


[12-Sep-24 07:09 AM] tanda#0000
apologies on taking two days to get back to you, it's been difficult to get time to focus on this


[12-Sep-24 07:15 AM] tanda#0000
Correction, took another look at it. Fairer price is 150 per unit on BRM. 74k per day income with an ROI of 13 days


[12-Sep-24 07:16 AM] tanda#0000
the CX prices this stuff ridiculously high due to lack of anyone willing to haul it

you could put all the LMs at planets you care about together on one screen

[15-Sep-24 02:44 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, most offers on local markets are not worth it


[15-Sep-24 02:44 AM] laaxus#0000
either it is product way above or under market price
Or shipping contract that pay very few


[15-Sep-24 02:45 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, a lot of corps use the LM to do internal trading, and it skews the LM low at a glance


[15-Sep-24 02:46 AM] tanda#0000
the reason I think a spreadsheet would be worthwhile isn't because the LM is fantastically amazing, but because I can't fit more than about 8 LM buffers on a screen comfortably

I was wondering how  I could contribute to the ADI


[15-Sep-24 05:01 AM] laaxus#0000
And then I thought about TSH


[15-Sep-24 05:01 AM] laaxus#0000
currently, TSH ask price is 35k, but I've done the math, and I could provide 20TSH a day for 22K (seeing the capital needed, it wouldn't be soon)


[15-Sep-24 05:03 AM] laaxus#0000
Would this make high temperature planets viable or would they remain too unviable ?


[15-Sep-24 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
Would there be a demand ?


[15-Sep-24 05:15 AM] tanda#0000
so, yes TSH is already in demand


[15-Sep-24 05:15 AM] tanda#0000
that's about to spike hugely due to gateways


[15-Sep-24 05:15 AM] tanda#0000
but have you looked at the capital and Pop cost necessary to run a base of pp4s?


[15-Sep-24 05:16 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, the issue is capital


[15-Sep-24 05:16 AM] laaxus#0000
I can't provide for it, atm


[15-Sep-24 05:17 AM] laaxus#0000
and I can't take a 9M loan for a base that give no revenue


[15-Sep-24 05:18 AM] laaxus#0000
but true, tsh will be needed for gateways


[15-Sep-24 05:18 AM] tanda#0000
I'm working towards a PP4 base myself. I feel like I need anywhere from 3-6 more permits of construction bases before I could supply a PP4 base


[15-Sep-24 05:19 AM] laaxus#0000
why 3-6 permits for construction ?


[15-Sep-24 05:19 AM] laaxus#0000
for the LBH ?


[15-Sep-24 05:20 AM] tanda#0000
not to supply TSH period. AFABs make excellent money but cost a lot of resources to make


[15-Sep-24 05:21 AM] tanda#0000
I have actually already started working on building THP to be ready for the TSH demand increase


[15-Sep-24 05:32 AM] laaxus#0000
Then I guess my contribution will be supply CF and keep prices low


[15-Sep-24 05:33 AM] laaxus#0000
BTW that surge in CF demand will increase the pressure in AL


[15-Sep-24 05:58 AM] tanda#0000
AL has enough supply to ride it out easily


[15-Sep-24 05:58 AM] tanda#0000

I only have 3 EXT on there right now - all I could handle with starter ship shipping. That's just over 100 BRM per day. How much are you going to need right away and how long to ramp up?


[18-Sep-24 12:33 PM] tanda#0000
4 weeks to full ramp. Don't worry, not expecting to be 100% efficiency off the bat. Contract me for shipping, next load out there will be much smaller than this one

how much BRM will you need per day at the start?


[18-Sep-24 07:32 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I make just over 100 as is


[18-Sep-24 07:34 PM] tanda#0000
to start with, 140 per day with current population levels (assuming I get a good chunk in the round robin between the 3 of us in 2 days)
Until Avacyn establishes a base out there, I will only be dropping 11 CHPs. That will use 619, or slightly more than what your full base makes


[18-Sep-24 07:35 PM] tanda#0000
things will ramp up pretty quickly after that. If I can get the ADM built tomorrow, I'll have governorship in 4 days and start to be able to run workforce programs


[18-Sep-24 07:36 PM] tanda#0000
so I would definitely prioritize getting your base filled out so you have somewhere for pop to go


[18-Sep-24 07:36 PM] tanda#0000
Do you have a full 30 days of supplies out there for max pop?


[18-Sep-24 07:38 PM] getonthetrain#0000
no, I have 2 weeks for the 3 EXT


[18-Sep-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not sure how busy your ships are, but this is a far trip to make even every couple weeks


[18-Sep-24 07:38 PM] getonthetrain#0000
1 more hab and 2 more EXT will produce enough for your start


[18-Sep-24 07:39 PM] getonthetrain#0000
right now I have one starter ship going back and forth with BRM


[18-Sep-24 07:39 PM] getonthetrain#0000
well, back - not forth


[18-Sep-24 07:39 PM] getonthetrain#0000
one you are eating it all up, that ship'll be free


[18-Sep-24 07:39 PM] tanda#0000
alright, that will be about 3-4 weeks


[18-Sep-24 07:40 PM] getonthetrain#0000
ok, so I need supplies for 1 hab and 2 ext right away to supply you


[18-Sep-24 07:40 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I have 1020 MCG 3 BSE and 2 BTA in place


[18-Sep-24 07:41 PM] getonthetrain#0000
just stuff I had lying around that I positioned


[18-Sep-24 07:41 PM] tanda#0000
if you're running double STO and can spare the cash, I recommend parking materials for the remainder of the 14 extractors and setting them up every week before POPR


[18-Sep-24 07:41 PM] tanda#0000
it'll make it seamless, any pop growth will start work immediately


[18-Sep-24 07:42 PM] getonthetrain#0000
well, I don't have much cash right now


[18-Sep-24 07:42 PM] tanda#0000
if it's a matter of cash, let me know. I've got 150 BSE and BBH sitting on Nike Jr waiting to get picked up


[18-Sep-24 07:42 PM] getonthetrain#0000
do have plenty of materials to work into cash though, set up on that front


[18-Sep-24 07:42 PM] tanda#0000
and I'm decentish on cashflow at the moment


[18-Sep-24 07:42 PM] getonthetrain#0000
If you can bring what I will need to grow with you, I can pay you back in free BRM


[18-Sep-24 07:44 PM] tanda#0000
No worries. How many STO/HABs/EXT do you have set up or dispatched currently?


[18-Sep-24 07:44 PM] getonthetrain#0000
2 HAB, 3 EXT


[18-Sep-24 07:44 PM] getonthetrain#0000
with 1020 MCG 3 BSE and 2 BTA on planet


[18-Sep-24 07:45 PM] tanda#0000
alright, I'll pull together a list and see if I can fit it


[18-Sep-24 07:45 PM] getonthetrain#0000
1 HAB gives worker space for 2 more EXT which supplies your initial BRM need


[18-Sep-24 07:45 PM] tanda#0000
the biggest expenses for these bases is HSE and BSE, lol


[18-Sep-24 07:46 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yes, been trying to get HSE on the bid


[18-Sep-24 07:46 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Arclight has 10 at nice price


[18-Sep-24 07:46 PM] getonthetrain#0000
actually like the whole supply


[18-Sep-24 07:47 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I can run to arclightw with a starter ship for the ones we don't need right away


[18-Sep-24 07:47 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and save us some cash


[18-Sep-24 07:47 PM] tanda#0000
it's 3k a pop, the bases will make more than that per hour when fully set up


[18-Sep-24 07:48 PM] tanda#0000
that and I will soon be adding HSE to the list of things I make


[18-Sep-24 07:49 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yes, but they have 57 and we can buy them all, use what we need and flip the rest


[18-Sep-24 07:49 PM] getonthetrain#0000
57x3 = 171k


[18-Sep-24 07:49 PM] tanda#0000
flipping them is a great idea if you have the time, you should do that


[18-Sep-24 07:49 PM] getonthetrain#0000
understood then


[18-Sep-24 07:51 PM] getonthetrain#0000
oh, I made 100 office supplies and are on planet for when needed


[18-Sep-24 07:53 PM] tanda#0000
oops, I just bought 300 for a full stock up. the ones you brought will fit in the SST in about 11 days


[18-Sep-24 07:53 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yea, no worries - will eventually be needed


[18-Sep-24 07:53 PM] tanda#0000
or you could stock them in now

going to need a little bit once I land


[18-Sep-24 09:02 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Looks like there will be 208 BRM waiting for you to start with


[18-Sep-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
excellent, I'll send a cont


[18-Sep-24 09:03 PM] tanda#0000
hm, actually could you cont me for it?


[18-Sep-24 09:04 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yup


[18-Sep-24 09:04 PM] tanda#0000
otherwise it'll stick at fulfilment attempted, and the base drops in an hour


[18-Sep-24 09:04 PM] getonthetrain#0000
wait, I thought the ship was coming in about 18 hours - or is that a 2nd ship?


[18-Sep-24 09:05 PM] getonthetrain#0000
I have 106 right now and 1hr18 until 51 more BRM


[18-Sep-24 09:06 PM] tanda#0000
the ship with my base on it drops in 1 hour, COGC/ADM and the materials for further expanding your base arrives in 18 hours


[18-Sep-24 09:06 PM] tanda#0000
there's enough materials involved I'm having to use both of my WCBs for this initial move


[18-Sep-24 10:23 PM] tanda#0000

[18-Sep-24 10:26 PM] getonthetrain#0000
oh, good. I was like I don't have any ships even heading to ANT right now to pick some up and send it on its way


[18-Sep-24 10:42 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Don't beat yourself up too badly, I brought everything I needed to start here except for basic overalls. My dudes were working at around 58% efficiency and taking nearly a day to complete one cycle


[18-Sep-24 10:44 PM] tanda#0000
nah, I'm just intensely annoyed, lol. I gotta turn the second ship around for 8 TRU, rendezvous on Halcyon, then have both of them make it out to YK-266

How does upgrading your ships work?


[19-Sep-24 10:40 AM] jvaler#0000
you create an upgrade project in a planet's shipyard structure


[19-Sep-24 10:40 AM] jvaler#0000
not all planets have one as shipyards are player-built


[19-Sep-24 10:41 AM] jvaler#0000
hephaestus is the best one to use in ANT space imo, it's super close to the CX


[19-Sep-24 10:46 AM] .nvf#0000
...The hell is a glass-based STL engine


[19-Sep-24 10:48 AM] jvaler#0000
a cheaper engine, but lower power. also a bit lower on the tech tree so it was more useful earlier in the universe imo


[19-Sep-24 10:48 AM] .nvf#0000
weird... did we not always start with these same ships?


[19-Sep-24 10:49 AM] jvaler#0000
everyone always started with 2 starters afaik, but all ship upgrades and production have to be done by players


[19-Sep-24 10:51 AM] jvaler#0000
actually i think this isn't true for all shipyards, it seems some were here since the beginning

[19-Sep-24 10:53 AM] evov#0000
< I'd recommend against the glass engines / stl only ships. That was the first ship I made for myself long ago. Cheap to get started, but ended up costing more in fuel than a 2k/2k ship with a fuel saving engine. Now that there's a lot more access to cash/loans etc - I'd advise upgrading your starter ships to WCB ships, and then just buy whatever you need (LCB/WCB etc)


[19-Sep-24 10:53 AM] .nvf#0000
I was just confused why one engine seemed garbage, and how exactly it was made out of glass


[19-Sep-24 10:54 AM] evov#0000
Just cheap. Once upon a time it made sense.

glass engines were added specifically to allow people to make new stl ships without the very highest tier workers. They were sort of the standard option at the start of the universe but I don't think they've seen much action lately.


[19-Sep-24 09:56 PM] kynadre#0000
made my first market trip to get another week's worth of basic (and luxury!) pioneer supplies, building materials for another SME, and the O and C to keep smelting what I'm digging out of the ground. Wahoo!


[19-Sep-24 09:57 PM] kynadre#0000
I can see why STL fuel can be a hot commodity trying to speed up a flight to land at a time you can actually play, and not, you know, have to wait overnight for something XD


[19-Sep-24 09:57 PM] getonthetrain#0000
prob not worth it to bump STL flight bar beyond 2-4 hits


[19-Sep-24 09:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
diminishing returns

[19-Sep-24 10:02 PM] kynadre#0000
spending 250 fuel vs. 150 to save not even 20% of flight duration is so not worth it

Currently looking into building up my smelting base in Deimos. I tested a bit in Prun Planner, and it seems like extracting your own ALO increases my profit, but I heard people say not to build to much EXT... what are the opinions to that?


[20-Sep-24 05:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I could make like 4 EXT to 16 SME, which would mean I need to import ore. Or I could have like 7 or 8 EXT and produce my ore myself


[20-Sep-24 05:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
which would - as prun planner at least says - give me around 4000-8000 more profit


[20-Sep-24 05:14 AM] laaxus#0000
That's because smelting Al is a very Bad business atm


[20-Sep-24 05:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Extracting Alo is more profitable than smelting al


[20-Sep-24 05:15 AM] laaxus#0000
But that should not be the case


[20-Sep-24 05:16 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, currently, there isn't a "very good" recipe for sme


[20-Sep-24 05:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Do I get a full refund when deconstructing buildings?


[20-Sep-24 05:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Because then I could just switch later, when the market is more AL-leaning


[20-Sep-24 05:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and adjust the ratio as needed


[20-Sep-24 05:27 AM] .nvf#0000
For the first hour yes, after that no.


[20-Sep-24 05:28 AM] laaxus#0000
It's ok to extract ALO and smelt it
Or extract ALO and stock it
You're creating value anyway


[20-Sep-24 05:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
makes sense, since the builings are degrading over time... do you get any refund, or is the building just... gone?


[20-Sep-24 05:31 AM] evov#0000
Out of curiosity, what price would AL need to be at before it's no longer bad business?


[20-Sep-24 05:33 AM] .nvf#0000
You get a few of the parts, but it's not really worth taking in to account - budget for a full replacement

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[20-Sep-24 05:33 AM] .nvf#0000
Depends on the cost of C and O and FLX and ALO


[20-Sep-24 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
At current prices, with a full base of AL, you make a daily profit of 38k
Here's what would be the profit for different AL price :
800 -> 56.6k
850 -> 67k
900 -> 78k
950 -> 88k
1000 -> 98k

Up to you to decide what is a good business, but I think we can agree that 38k is bad business

For someone that has no point of reference, 38k could be the standard


[20-Sep-24 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
it really isn't
I consider 50k for a 500 area base to be the absolute minimum I would accept

[20-Sep-24 05:48 AM] evov#0000
I find people's connection to pricing super interesting sometimes.
If it's not worth making it below 800/unit. Why would you be selling it for 749/unit?


[20-Sep-24 05:49 AM] .nvf#0000
You underestimate the market power of "I don't care, I don't want this shit in my warehouse anymore."


[20-Sep-24 05:49 AM] evov#0000
Yea, that makes sense I guess.


[20-Sep-24 05:49 AM] .nvf#0000
There ARE reasons to sell at a loss, but none of them really apply to this game, since there's no tax or anything like that


[20-Sep-24 05:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
judging by the comments AL wasn't always that bad - so many probably already have a fully developed AL SME base and just dont want to wreck it, because the ROI is not as high as it used to be

[20-Sep-24 05:50 AM] evov#0000
Yea, it's moreso, the question of valuation. It's interesting. How and why people come up with the numbers they do.


[20-Sep-24 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
because sometimes, you need to sell it to have to money to buy input goods


[20-Sep-24 05:51 AM] laaxus#0000
and that liquid money can grow, sitting order does not


[20-Sep-24 05:53 AM] jvaler#0000
this isn't because AL is bad, ALO is just unusually expensive right now


[20-Sep-24 05:53 AM] laaxus#0000
same thing


[20-Sep-24 05:53 AM] laaxus#0000
price in absolute terms means nothing


[20-Sep-24 05:53 AM] jvaler#0000
well not if you're buying off deimos LM


[20-Sep-24 05:53 AM] laaxus#0000
price only have meaning in relation to another item


[20-Sep-24 05:54 AM] laaxus#0000
here, the price of AL related to ALO is bad


[20-Sep-24 05:54 AM] laaxus#0000
saying that ALO is too expensive (related to C for example) or AL too cheap (taking C again for reference)  is exactly the same


[20-Sep-24 05:58 AM] laaxus#0000
No wonder the ALO business is bad, the profit per permit is just not good enough for old players
Only for new players would that be interesting

gold and lithium seem like the most profitable things to smelt right now


[20-Sep-24 06:23 AM] .nvf#0000
I bought a shitload of sulfur crystals, so I'll work through those then reassess


[20-Sep-24 07:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Guys, I know this sounds crazy, but I have the feeling AL is going to EXPLODE soon. I mean, look at all the fuzz lately about it. More and more people join, most of them noobs like me producing cheep AL, flooding the market. I'm sure there is a shark out there WAITING to buy a huge load. 

I even have evidence - LOOK!

Just got 30M traded on AL.AI1


[20-Sep-24 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, it might rise because of Gateways


[20-Sep-24 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
but I don't consider gateways time to be usual business


[20-Sep-24 08:15 AM] evov#0000

[20-Sep-24 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
they aren't


[20-Sep-24 08:16 AM] laaxus#0000
but people are getting ready for it


[20-Sep-24 08:16 AM] evov#0000
Fair enough


[20-Sep-24 08:19 AM] manhim#0000
How'd you get this nice looking graph?


[20-Sep-24 08:19 AM] laaxus#0000
prunplanner


[20-Sep-24 08:58 AM] realharvey#0000
1 AL costs about 444 AIC to make (For me). Current AL prices have a really high margin


[20-Sep-24 08:59 AM] realharvey#0000
this usually leads to people producing it internally because its way cheaper (Thats what I do)


[20-Sep-24 09:00 AM] realharvey#0000
long Term AL prices will fall. Gateways on the other hand will probably stirr up the market big time and a lot of products will rise in prices


[20-Sep-24 09:00 AM] laaxus#0000
that's because you set your alo ext margin to 0


[20-Sep-24 09:01 AM] realharvey#0000
ALO costs 21 AIC to make


[20-Sep-24 09:01 AM] realharvey#0000
so I set it to 80 AIC


[20-Sep-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, to me an AL cost 550 to make


[20-Sep-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
still a margin, not a big enough margin


[20-Sep-24 09:03 AM] realharvey#0000
current AL price is 892 AIC


[20-Sep-24 09:03 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd call that quite a nice margin


[20-Sep-24 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
because someone bought 1M worth of AL today


[20-Sep-24 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
yesterday, AL price was 749


[20-Sep-24 09:04 AM] realharvey#0000
at ASK?


[20-Sep-24 09:04 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[20-Sep-24 09:04 AM] realharvey#0000
750 AIC is definitly a reasonable price


[20-Sep-24 09:05 AM] evov#0000
How do you know how much was bought? Is it a prunplaner thing?

[20-Sep-24 09:07 AM] realharvey#0000
but its green so someone filled a big Buy order


[20-Sep-24 09:07 AM] realharvey#0000
nothing really got traded at ask price


[20-Sep-24 09:08 AM] laaxus#0000
green means price increased


[20-Sep-24 09:08 AM] evov#0000
How did the price go up... if it was all just filling buy orders? Wouldn't someone have to actually buy at the ask price for it to go up?


[20-Sep-24 09:08 AM] jcheung#0000
What do you mean


[20-Sep-24 09:09 AM] realharvey#0000
i've been reading it wron then. Thanks for the correction ^^


[20-Sep-24 09:09 AM] laaxus#0000
not necessarely
Someone can fill ask order -> someone put higher bid order -> someone fill bid order at higher price


[20-Sep-24 09:10 AM] laaxus#0000
but anyway green means price increase, red means price decrease


[20-Sep-24 09:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs confusing, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the candlestick tracks the last _traded_ price, not bid or ask


[20-Sep-24 09:20 AM] manhim#0000
Yup


[20-Sep-24 09:21 AM] manhim#0000
There's a lot of missing metrics compared to trading platforms. I'd like to be able to see volume traded per price ranges. Would give a good idea of where the price pressures are.

Pressure points


[20-Sep-24 09:23 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, this is order-based, but not transaction-based


[20-Sep-24 09:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
But the orders determine what the transactions can be. At least that‚Äôs how I like to think of it


[20-Sep-24 09:24 AM] evov#0000
I supose you can't really tell how much was traded at what price, only the start price and the end point and the total volume. For all you know 90% of it was bought at the top, or the bottom end of that candle stick.


[20-Sep-24 09:24 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, pretty much


[20-Sep-24 09:24 AM] marat_sh#0000

That'll happen. I think playing on the CX is fun and interesting... but it's not really creating value. Maybe a little bit is created when you transport goods from one area to another, but for the most part it doesn't actually create anything. Production capacity is what's important when it comes to growing/developing a universe imo

No, I just recognise the value of being able to get what you need now, instead of later. For the same reason there's a price gap between asks and bids.

I'm surprisingly flexible.


[20-Sep-24 10:03 AM] evov#0000
The reality is that even at the price I'm charging... it's about half a mil less than I get selling it as parts on the CX. And puts the value of all the bases involved somewhere between EPO and EDC with respect to $/Area


[20-Sep-24 10:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
How many bases do you use for your shipbuilding? Just curious üôÇ


[20-Sep-24 10:06 AM] evov#0000
Its hard to say because some bases aren't 100% into ships etc. Like, epo, pg etc get used in multiple areas


[20-Sep-24 10:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
Fair - I‚Äôve never touched shipbuilding myself. My most complicated supply chain is FIM üòÑ


[20-Sep-24 10:09 AM] evov#0000
This is my list of bui's / bases
I'd say between 50-70% go towards building ships. I don't do all my own smelting, but I think 95% of everything past the metals (AL/TI etc) I do myself.

So I end up buying a lot of AL/TI/STL etc off the CX. And maybe 50% of the raw materials

APF's which mostly go into ship building.... also make HQ upgrade stuff like ADS/LOG etc. Same with electronics inputs for those things.


[20-Sep-24 10:12 AM] evov#0000
Same base that makes LFE/MFE/SFE - also just sells off spare capacitor banks for MM cash. Things like that make it hard to pin down.


[20-Sep-24 10:12 AM] realharvey#0000

There's a lot of electronics bases that I could just.... stop doing ship stuff on and start making IDC's as an example


[20-Sep-24 10:14 AM] evov#0000
I used to make a lot of LDE before I started making ships. Now they just fill out the rest of a base until I need it for something else


[20-Sep-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000

IDC/EDC base on the other hand ...


[20-Sep-24 10:15 AM] evov#0000
The lde is definitely just a "side gig" for that base

if there's any profession that deserve 300k per base, it's ship building


[20-Sep-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
at least they create real value


[20-Sep-24 10:15 AM] getonthetrain#0000
I don't know why the devs chose a no input thing to give rich folks free cash


[20-Sep-24 10:15 AM] evov#0000
It doesn't get anywhere close to that. It's about 100-150ish averaged out across all the bases needed.


[20-Sep-24 10:16 AM] getonthetrain#0000
ship parts would have fit the lore anyways, heading into new space would mean lots of ships needed


[20-Sep-24 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
still good


[20-Sep-24 10:16 AM] evov#0000
I do have 2 IDC bases though. I built them after I finished building out the ship building network because cashflow was becomming a major concern. I needed something liquid I could quickly sell as needed.


[20-Sep-24 10:17 AM] evov#0000
Yea, at 6mil per ship, it's definitely worth it to keep building them. If I was getting 5mil.... I'd start ripping down bases and make something else and just convert my existing stock into ships for myself.


[20-Sep-24 10:19 AM] evov#0000
But you gotta understand, the cost to set up a ship building pipeline, is about the same cost as one of these new gateways. There's a lot of "stock" in the system. And you can't really start the next step until you've got a decent amount of inputs built up from the previous step

man, shipbuilding, what a production pipeline that is, esp. with all the different choices. That was making my head spin a bit when I was looking at materials I could extract and "what are they actually used for"


[20-Sep-24 01:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Shipbuilding actually isn't all that bad... I've had to maintain a single ship-building permit at Nike for years, since the market never actually met my needs, at all (especially some time ago, when there were no CX offerings for any parts). 

ASM mats were "corrected" some time of about a year ago. FFCs + engines + emitters got "corrected" at about the same time. Pretty much the entirety of the market has shifted towards internal production, and non-CX offerings. 

You've got production lines for the SKF stuff (cargo/fuel bays), the HWP/WEL (structural stuff), and the STL/FTL engines w/ Emitters, and you have some minor contingent for the electronics for Command Bridges + FFCs. 

It's really not much of an issue, if you keep in touch with what the market can offer, at reasonable rates. Beyond that you'll just have to adjust, to avoid cutting off an arm and leg, so that you'll have access to some high-margin items that are made available on the CX, intermittently.

[20-Sep-24 01:22 PM] kynadre#0000
That makes sense. Every time I see something ship-related in the production planner things, while looking at what minerals n such to dig up, they're used so rarely that it makes sense why their prices are jacked up. They're really not sustainable as the "main" thing someone does


[20-Sep-24 01:22 PM] kynadre#0000
which begets the problem


[20-Sep-24 01:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The low-tier, raw materials, are usually a "surplus" market thing... No one is buying... People who extract it... Will have an excess. This is a prunplanner "law", since no one ever builds some processing base, without having some sort of excess production, which they then get rid of, on the cheap.... Unless they're actively using the CX, to fuel their operations (this explains some of the erratic behavior on the low-tier I/O materials on the markets... Metals, low --> mid range electronics, et.c.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[20-Sep-24 01:28 PM] kynadre#0000
That definitely makes sense. For that sort of thing, everyone's going to just get it themself, at a base where they can primarily get something they -actually- make their bread and butter money on. Just work it into the extraction cycle once in a while as needed


[20-Sep-24 01:47 PM] evov#0000
There's just a lot of intermediate steps between raw materials and ships. And a lot of those intermediate steps don't really have another use. If you're making a complicated machine with 50 parts, and it's completely useless if you only have 49 of the parts... supply security starts to be come more important than sourcing the cheapest way to source things.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[20-Sep-24 01:49 PM] kynadre#0000
it seems it's an area of the game that could use more demand and more supply simultaneously, aka, it needs to be a more active market and also be worth peoples' time to make it a thing they do. In other words, basically a game population issue at this point?


[20-Sep-24 01:51 PM] evov#0000
If you're making fabs, and you run out of NR.. you can just be like... oh well, I guess I'll make ABH next week and just punch out some ASE for now. If you're focused on consumables, and you can't make MEA at the moment.... you just keep making more of the other stuff, and it doesn't have any impact on your PT or HMS production lines because they can all be sold separately.

People tend to look at you funny when you want to sell them a ship without a fuel tank.

{Reactions}
ü§£ this 

[20-Sep-24 01:54 PM] evov#0000
So there's just long lists of inputs, and if you run out of any of them, multiple bases can come to a grinding halt pretty quick.


[20-Sep-24 01:55 PM] kynadre#0000
Really need a lot of buffer, then, a lot of cash just tied up in resources you don't need all that much of, but you can't afford to run out of


[20-Sep-24 01:57 PM] evov#0000
Yea. At the start, I was constantly making trips to and from bases with near empty ships because (in hindsight) I tried to spool up too quickly without waiting to build up enough of a buffer from the previous step.


[20-Sep-24 01:59 PM] kynadre#0000
The first trip to the CX to get a few more days' buffer of food and smelter stuff (O, C), and I'm like, this takes HOW much STL fuel??? really made me rethink trip frequency and understand how other players are playing, too


[20-Sep-24 01:59 PM] kynadre#0000
also makes me want to prioritize both the CF production line and the fuel production as my goals before looking at something like food (since a lot of other folks doing food atm I think)


[20-Sep-24 02:00 PM] evov#0000
Where possible, I'll have a full ship either to or from a base ( rarely both ) But sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do.

[20-Sep-24 02:00 PM] kynadre#0000
sucks that even if Phobos were changed to a fuel production bonus, I still don't think it's a good base cuz the GAL is such a low %, but I could be wrong. It's really just a newbro trap with how high the upfront material costs are, fuel production


[20-Sep-24 02:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Generally, you're looking at something like 150 SF + 150 FF usages, across the board.. Could be much less, depending on your engines. That metric defines break-even prices for contract shipping, at 16 creds, per commodity, across the board... Most STL hauls are below that, and most higher-tier FTL jobs, are above that.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[20-Sep-24 02:06 PM] kynadre#0000
Thanks for the metric! That makes sense


[20-Sep-24 02:06 PM] kynadre#0000
it's FF that flexes the most depending on how far from the CX but that burn to the CX itself is expensive


[20-Sep-24 02:06 PM] kynadre#0000
at least for a newbro


[20-Sep-24 02:06 PM] kynadre#0000
makes sense that's why it's got so much more in the beginner ship cargo


[20-Sep-24 02:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's like a handful of other mechanics regarding it... I wouldn't want to spend more time in say FK-794, or SE-110 system, than I have to, in transit, with an FTL, since the operating environments are harsher than say VH-331.


[20-Sep-24 02:07 PM] kynadre#0000

I agree for a starter player


[23-Sep-24 03:04 AM] evov#0000
Less than 20 permits is where I'd draw that line. After that, permit costs sky rocket, and you just can't get the same rate of return out of expanding bases.


[23-Sep-24 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
Once you get to 20 permits, it's better for the money to sit in the cx because it cr√©ates a little value at least


[23-Sep-24 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
Better losing 3% a week than 5


[23-Sep-24 03:11 AM] evov#0000
You're free to think whatever you want, I'm not trying to change your mind. But if you're going to be giving new players advice that is. . . . maybe not entirely accurate.... I'm going provide a 2nd opinion. For new players (permits <20) your capital is worth a lot more than 4% per week.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[23-Sep-24 03:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Mmm I see where you are coming from


[23-Sep-24 03:13 AM] laaxus#0000
Would you say that 200k on the cx lose value at the same rate than 1m5 would ?


[23-Sep-24 03:17 AM] evov#0000
Rather than look at what some of the richest players in the game offer as interest rates for the loans they give out.... this is how/why I would value begginer (less than 20 permits) player capital ->

Avg cost per HQ upgrade up to 20 -> 600k
Avg cost per base (for beginnier, t1/2 type bases) - 1-2mil

So when you look in your planner at your base... and it says something like ( Plan Cost / Roi ) - 1.5mil - 14day RoI. Adding the cost of the avg permit <20 to that.... raises the RoI up to maybe 20ish.

20 Day RoI = 5% per day.


[23-Sep-24 03:18 AM] evov#0000
RoI per base will change based on what you're doing etc... but <20 roi should be very very achievable / typical.


[23-Sep-24 03:18 AM] laaxus#0000
I agree with this train of thought


[23-Sep-24 03:19 AM] laaxus#0000
But what about small amount like 200k
Players can't pay a base with that
So would that 5% still apply ?


[23-Sep-24 03:20 AM] evov#0000
Yes. You need (or should) be treating it like it's worth 5% per day.


[23-Sep-24 03:22 AM] evov#0000

holy shit what are you doing on ZV-194b? and deimos? what metallurgy is that profitable? are the CX settings weird or something?


[23-Sep-24 03:35 AM] evov#0000
No, it just highlights the sillyness of people's over-reliance on prunplanner sometimes.


[23-Sep-24 03:36 AM] evov#0000
When you start getting into some... less commonly used items... there just isn't reliable prices on the CX for it to reference.

There's a stack of things like that.


[23-Sep-24 03:37 AM] evov#0000
If I then go to a base that makes that item... the profit for that production line is negative.


[23-Sep-24 03:38 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, the biggest issue with prunplanner is that for commodities with no orders, it just put 0


[23-Sep-24 03:38 AM] laaxus#0000
leading to false earnings


[23-Sep-24 03:38 AM] evov#0000
It doesn't have to be zero. There's other options for pricing.. but all of them have different issues.

Makes sense, since that's a transition point when they're saving capital for their next base / investment / transition, rather than actively funneling money back into the improvement of their non-maxed first base

[24-Sep-24 08:24 AM] evov#0000
My very rough estimates when looking at planets / distance...  1 Day flight = 15k in fuel and 60k in ship capital. So if you're needing to fill up 1 ship per day.... subtract 75k from whatever you think you're making per day. Double that if it's a 2 day flight each way.

[24-Sep-24 02:31 PM] kynadre#0000
I imagine your ships are a bit bigger than most peoples' but by the point folks are making pure extractor colonies, they are, too


[24-Sep-24 02:31 PM] kynadre#0000
plus it accounts for opportunity cost of tying up the ships


[24-Sep-24 05:24 PM] evov#0000
You can always ask someone who does shipping commercially what sort of price they'd want to transport to/from the CX. Or potentially sell it on the CX (at a suitable discount). The important part to remember is that ships are valuable. Fuel isn't free, and they could always be making money doing something else, so it should be a consideration.

[24-Sep-24 05:51 PM] kynadre#0000
def looking forward to setting up some extraction stuff later to support it going more pure if demand for CF justifies it going from 16ish/day to 25ish/day, even 50ish/day


[24-Sep-24 05:56 PM] evov#0000
As with everything that comes out of a smelter... if the price is right, I'll buy it.
I even offered to provide the inputs for free, handle the shipping, and buy the output at a price that represents about 50k/day profit for the base. But people seemed un-interested, so I'll just wait till they send it to the CX and we can all just ride the ups and downs of the market üôÇ

[24-Sep-24 10:44 PM] evov#0000
There's a few. But be mindful with SI - SIO is a byproduct/waste product of some higher teir stuff. So it might have an impact on the price of SIO.. regardless of extraction points.

[25-Sep-24 12:47 AM] kynadre#0000
It's likely the low proportion of players who can accept contracts or see local markets

Yeah I just use other less demanding recipes to even out my BRM consumption with the output of the base feeding me, but that doesn't always work great since demand for the others is low. OLF is barely used and PFE is easy to overproduce

There's just stuff that I thought was important.. but over time I find I virtually never look at it. Or it's rare enough I can easily just open another window on those occasions.

[25-Sep-24 06:30 PM] kynadre#0000
it makes sense to subdivide across multiple screens once there's multiple bases


[25-Sep-24 06:30 PM] kynadre#0000
like, this is really helpful for me for one base, but maybe once I had 6 bases I'd want a screen just for production for all bases, a screen just for the worker needs and supply depth, etc.

if I had 20 in an order, but could only store 10... would it give me 10 and put the other 10 in a contract, or put the whole lot in a contract?

I don't think selling at ask Price is best


[30-Sep-24 01:29 AM] laaxus#0000
I usually set the Price at something that give me a good profit, but not an overwhelming one


[30-Sep-24 01:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Because people would rather not buy an overpriced item and Swap recipes


[30-Sep-24 01:30 AM] laaxus#0000
So they either Swap recipes or find a local supplier


[30-Sep-24 01:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Except for consommables, they can't avoid it


[30-Sep-24 01:32 AM] .nvf#0000
That's true, I hadn't considered that


[30-Sep-24 01:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Same thing for bid orders


[30-Sep-24 01:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I needed si, so I put a worthwhile bid order


[30-Sep-24 01:49 AM] laaxus#0000
Now It's almost filled


[30-Sep-24 02:34 AM] evov#0000
Buying / Selling at ask vs bid - It's situational. There is no 1 correct answer.

Things you should consider when making that choice -
What is the price now, what do you think the price will be in the future.
What is the price on other CX's?
What's the difference between the bid/ask prices.
How long will it take the order to fill?
What value do you place on capital. ( could you get a better RoI by using that cash to build something, or is it better for it to sit on the CX in the hopes of buying/selling something at a better price.


[30-Sep-24 03:38 AM] .nvf#0000
This is why I will never be a daytrader


[30-Sep-24 04:13 AM] evov#0000
It sounds a bit overwhelming. But it's like bricks in a wall. Answering one question, helps you understand and answer the next question etc.

Start off with working out what value you place on capital. The process of working it out, as well a having an answer - helps with plenty of other questions/tradeoffs you might have in the future imo.


[30-Sep-24 04:15 AM] razenpok#0000
... or you could just throw money around and experiment with your capital to understand its value by practical application


[30-Sep-24 04:15 AM] razenpok#0000
(that was my way of understanding it)


[30-Sep-24 04:32 AM] .nvf#0000
as long as numby go up, I will not feel like I have wasted my grant


[01-Oct-24 05:22 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you have several production bases, putting up BID.AI1 orders, to cut down on marginal expenditures for needed inputs might be a good idea, but the transaction rates on Bids aren't so fast as they are on the Asks.

6x more efficient per load

It's been a good week. Each week I'll do a stocktake. Where I remove all my CX orders and record all materials I've got in the CX warehouses.  Doesn't include materials on bases or in ships, but it gives me a rough indicator of progression at least.

Just curious, what metrics do other people use to measure your growth / net worth etc in the game?

rate at which line go up, and rate at which line go up go up


[04-Oct-24 09:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
although my net worth has been pretty static over the last few months, since I haven't expanded much and have been selling a lot of my stuff at favorable prices


[04-Oct-24 09:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
I stated a sheet some time ago to pull all my inventory + ships + reclaimables from buildings through FIO to get a net worth number, but I never really maintained it


[04-Oct-24 09:20 AM] jcheung#0000
:/ i feel you shouldn't delist... you can use FIO and be able to pull data on what you have in CXOS


[04-Oct-24 10:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah XIT FIN pulls in your stock on the CX. I'd just be way too lazy to delist and relist anything üòÑ


[04-Oct-24 10:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also have stuff that's been listed for more than a year, so I probably should


[04-Oct-24 03:11 PM] evov#0000
Yea, I don't use fio or any of those tools. Just the raw steam version +spreadsheets. Getting info and solving problems that way is half the fun for me with this game. -but I do like the way some of them look.

One of the practical benefits I find of doing the weekly (take down CX orders / repost ) is that before I started doing it, I'd find I let bad orders just sit there, pointlessly soaking up capital. Sales that never sell, bids that never fill etc. At least this way it forces me to (each week) re-evaluate the prices I'm trying to buy/sell for.

That makes sense


[04-Oct-24 03:20 PM] jcheung#0000
So much work to do that weekly


[04-Oct-24 03:21 PM] kynadre#0000
it helps people looking at market for opportunity, though, to see reasonable prices and actual demand


[04-Oct-24 03:21 PM] kynadre#0000
others can make plans to fill needs and simplify someone else's production line


[04-Oct-24 03:21 PM] kynadre#0000
esp. how many people are on one, two, just a few bases, and can carve out a slice of the pie


[04-Oct-24 03:22 PM] jcheung#0000
So there's another group of people that play with markets, and they were doing weekly.... I'm not involved in that portion, but i could see the people who were, uhm... not liking that they had to wrap things up once a week to give an accounting of things


[04-Oct-24 03:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Especially when monthly is usually fine for most things


[04-Oct-24 03:54 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
When my FIN is green on Sunday nights... it's all good. When it's red for like 1 week? Also good. 

I've taken extreme pains to literally become a simple HYF farmer, and FP processor. Huge investments in shipping, which will also get upgraded rather soon. Did I lose a lot of potential expansions, CX/COGC PPU concerns, and overall opportunity? Sure. 

But there is a point where your "empire" becomes troublesome to keep tabs on... Even with PMMG+, Prunplanner, and private spreadsheets, once you get to like 60 permits, and like 60 ships.... You're going to be devoting a lot of personal time in such weekly upkeep... Every week.. every month... every year. 

I hold a premium on my personal leisure time, which is why I don't really care about player micromanagement of market operations... I do care more for universe wide preferences in incentive-based macro-management of game-play tendencies though.

[04-Oct-24 03:57 PM] evov#0000
Probably takes me about 15 -45min - depending on distractions. Copy/Paste CX data. Hit delete about 100 times. Copy/Paste Warehouse data. Repost standard stuff I sell all the time. Re-evaluate what stuff I want to buy. 
The re-evaluate what stuff I want to buy part could take longer - but unless I'm willing to leave ineffective orders listed until the end of time, that's a step I'd need to do regardless.


[04-Oct-24 03:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
CX orders are "effective" until potential market competitors deliver the "good stuff" to market, in the following weeks, and fully eat up any sales turnover possible.... This is potentially hard to do, in many cases.


[04-Oct-24 03:59 PM] evov#0000
One of the benefits of it - I get to keep a history of my CX activity. So I can see (at least as far as the CX goes ) where I'm spending, where I'm earning, and avg prices paid for things..... which I use as an important indicator when buying things in bulk from players via contracts.

[11-Oct-24 03:00 PM] finestone#0000
That seems good. INC's will need a Reasource Extractions COGC


[11-Oct-24 03:00 PM] finestone#0000
Nascent is a good option as you can also get some ALO


[11-Oct-24 03:01 PM] finestone#0000
1-STO 12-HB1 4-EXT 24-INC is a 500 base


[11-Oct-24 03:03 PM] finestone#0000
that being said 600 t Export at max effiency may be difficult shipping for you so maybe run base at half till you can get WCB upgrades on your starter ships


[11-Oct-24 05:13 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
Yeah, prolly have to go pro license at some point as well i guess. So the base setup you suggested for Nascent is purely export to my AL production base then, is it better to just import the AGR commodities needed for INCs than to produce it myself?


[11-Oct-24 08:35 PM] finestone#0000
You certainly can as it is profitable to do so! I show that base at about 60k-70k daily (max experts) buying inputs off CX but you would be subject to the market luckily there are a couple choices for inputs and there shouldnt be shortage.


[11-Oct-24 08:36 PM] finestone#0000
profitabilty and inputs are not really the problem for that base it is the shipping time and fuel cost.


[11-Oct-24 08:38 PM] finestone#0000
That being said another route you can take is find buyers that will pick up from you and just give them a discount üôÇ


[11-Oct-24 08:43 PM] tanda#0000
worth pointing out that AGRI markets are very thin. A small, self supplying base won't really stress them too much, but attempting to scale will run them dry

What exactly are the benefits of a corporation, I watched the in game tutorial but it didn't really help with understanding how corps are used in game and what the realistic benefits of it would be. Could anyone shed a little light on it for me?


[12-Oct-24 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000
Corps are glorified groups of friend


[12-Oct-24 01:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
It's not that different from this server... It's a group of people who work together to reach a goal what ever goal is... Plus you get a 10% bonus on corp HQ


[12-Oct-24 01:13 PM] mancules#0000
Gotcha, thank you guys


[12-Oct-24 01:13 PM] mancules#0000
From other mmos I kinda figured it would shake out like that but I wanted to make sure


[12-Oct-24 01:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
I assume many corp features are not implemented yet


[12-Oct-24 01:16 PM] mancules#0000
Will be cool to see where they take them then, gotta be a lot of opportunities to make them impactful


[12-Oct-24 01:18 PM] mancules#0000
Also, while doing some preplanning for future bases I've noticed some planets don't have any population. Is it a safe bet, while I'm still a fledgling company, that planets with zero current population aren't a solid investment


[12-Oct-24 01:18 PM] mancules#0000
Like I should be looking towards other, populated, planets for my next expansion


[12-Oct-24 01:19 PM] tanda#0000
yes, absolutely


[12-Oct-24 01:19 PM] tanda#0000
planets in general are developed by more advanced players who have a need for more planets of certain COGC types, or for resource extraction


[12-Oct-24 01:20 PM] tanda#0000
I'm just about done stepping up YK-266c in order to make REA production easier, and it's been expensive and time consuming


[12-Oct-24 01:21 PM] tanda#0000
don't worry, we all feel the call of the pioneer here


[12-Oct-24 01:21 PM] mancules#0000
Makes sense, will probably plan around a planet in my current system then to minimize the logistical load with two ships


[12-Oct-24 01:21 PM] mancules#0000
Plus theyre pretty active in terms of population


[12-Oct-24 01:23 PM] mancules#0000
Is there a typical progression that players follow, or do I just mess around in the prun planner and adi to find something I think will be successful


[12-Oct-24 01:24 PM] tanda#0000
the second one is more fun


[12-Oct-24 01:25 PM] mancules#0000
That's what I like to hear


[12-Oct-24 01:25 PM] tanda#0000
that said, it makes a lot of sense(and helps with transportation) to try to build vertically from your starting base


[12-Oct-24 01:25 PM] tanda#0000
either tackle your personal supply needs, or further refine your goods before selling

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[12-Oct-24 01:26 PM] laaxus#0000
there's few type of profitable base once you look at it
I recommend testing things in prun
If you want a starting point I recommend checking the following bases : https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1254643011980234863/1292873346932932699


[12-Oct-24 01:26 PM] laaxus#0000
You should also think a bit about what kind of prun gameplay is fun to you


[12-Oct-24 01:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
this is the most important part


[12-Oct-24 01:27 PM] mancules#0000
I'll take a look here and see where it leads me, thanks!


[12-Oct-24 01:28 PM] laaxus#0000
There's a few people that like to roleplay into an horizontal company : (zipatsu with water, JPM with manufacturing, Aracyn with mining)
There's a few people that like doing an entirely vertical industry, minimizing risk
There's a few people that like a more high risk high reward gameplay


[12-Oct-24 01:28 PM] mancules#0000
This is something I've been trying to figure out, there's just so much it seems you can do and I'm not at the place to try most of it yet


[12-Oct-24 01:32 PM] mancules#0000
But to circle back a bit, I noticed the COGC over at Agamemnon which is in my current system is chemistry, I haven't run a prun planner to know if it would be profitable but just for the sake of understanding the building vertical point, if I set up a flux production line to feed flux to my current base creating AL, that would be essentially building vertically?


[12-Oct-24 01:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I always recommend refining goods. The closer you get to end-consumer use, the more margin there generally is with the final process.


[12-Oct-24 01:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Unless of course, the market's just bottom out, like with H2O all over the universe.


[12-Oct-24 01:34 PM] mancules#0000
So to that point, taking the AL somewhere to further refine it into say construction materials


[12-Oct-24 01:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But then it's a COGC/planet thing, with shipping.


[12-Oct-24 01:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's a hybrid arrangement, unless if you setup different bases for those different things.


[12-Oct-24 01:35 PM] laaxus#0000
Building vertically means producing the input you need
This increases margins because this is strictly equivalent to selling at ask, buying at ask
But with the following perks :
- you "sell" instantly the inputs good you produced
- you don't suffer from an unstable input good price
- you don't suffer from input goods shortage

There are no economic downside to be vertical, the game even encourage it


[12-Oct-24 01:36 PM] jvaler#0000
nike is considered the go-to for that. you build PP2 and turn AL into bfabs/lfabs depending on the market


[12-Oct-24 01:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, and no. Just divide out the eventual "revenues" over the permits required for the plan.


[12-Oct-24 01:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That'll be your income. Compare it with other methods.


[12-Oct-24 01:37 PM] mancules#0000
Ahhh ok I get it concept now


[12-Oct-24 01:38 PM] mancules#0000
So then if that's the case, if I want to build a vertical base, backwards planning is the way to go, finding the end good I want to produce and sell and then building up the inputs needed to get there


[12-Oct-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I consider this a vertical approach, if you use multiple bases/permits to get there... Hybrid if you only use 1 permit.


[12-Oct-24 01:39 PM] mancules#0000
Got it, that makes a lot of sense


[12-Oct-24 01:39 PM] jvaler#0000
> There are no economic downside to be vertical, the game even encourage it

if the thing you're making isn't profitable on it's own, it's a worse use of your resources


[12-Oct-24 01:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The economical downsides could be considered on many scales: Revenues. Net profits. Volume... Many people chase the first two... I chase the last one.


[12-Oct-24 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
yes, but that usually means someone is selling that input good at a loss
-> not sustainable


[12-Oct-24 01:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's a general lag in market prices for most things.... If intermediate/end use materials are having a huge price change... The critical events happened like a month ago, and you just didn't notice it.


[12-Oct-24 01:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Say for DW.... H2O basically went ballistic (shot up in price). It takes some time for people to churn through their inventories, and come up with a new price, if you aren't selling directly to ASKs or BIDS.


[12-Oct-24 01:43 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm i never thought about that, but yeah


[12-Oct-24 02:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
if item doesn't sell... refine it until it sells


[13-Oct-24 08:46 AM] mancules#0000
What‚Äôs the standard when it comes to trading? For instance I‚Äôve got a load of AL, option A is I bring it to Antares where I sell on the CX through bids and asks, I‚Äôve heard doing like a 50/50 split on them is a good idea, but option B is volume trades to a specific buyer, I‚Äôm sure it changes from player to player but what would be a good number before I put up a general trade offer? 500 tons worth or specific number value of the commodity ect and is it standard practice to store the commodity I plan to sell this way at a station like Antares or keep at my base to ship direct or for direct pick up?


[13-Oct-24 08:47 AM] mancules#0000
I‚Äôm sure this is nuanced and varies depending on the situation I‚Äôm just curious what the standard operating procedure is


[13-Oct-24 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
i you don't need money now, sell at ask, else, sell at bid


[13-Oct-24 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
a nuance is if there's a juicy enough bid order; then it's better to sell at bid, even if you don't need the money now


[13-Oct-24 08:54 AM] mancules#0000
Perfect makes sense, thank you


[13-Oct-24 08:55 AM] mancules#0000
As for a specific buyer I‚Äôll just keep my eyes open for any interest while I build up a stock


[13-Oct-24 08:59 AM] igfloz#0000
You might get a good response on the LM at Nike. there's more than a couple of people over there doing Construction prefabs


[13-Oct-24 09:29 AM] marat_sh#0000
Trading at ASK for AL is better deal right now


[13-Oct-24 09:30 AM] marat_sh#0000
if BIDs drop below 700/u you can start looking for consistent customers


[13-Oct-24 10:14 AM] realharvey#0000
You should figure out what your production cost is per AL. You'll have enough room for profit even selling at lower prices


[13-Oct-24 10:15 AM] realharvey#0000
Don't stress too much about maximizing profits


[13-Oct-24 10:43 AM] mancules#0000
This is good idea, I'll work on this now


[13-Oct-24 09:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Not true if they are supply factors relevant to the item. It‚Äôs usual for prices and supply at fixed price points to fluctuate regularly, and wildly


[13-Oct-24 10:21 PM] jvaler#0000
like raw agri?


[13-Oct-24 10:22 PM] jvaler#0000
you still have to account for the proftability of the end product too. so the cost of the extra FRM base just gets added on to the calculation for the end product


[13-Oct-24 10:26 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Exactly. If you vertically integrate, it‚Äôs not a complete waste of time looking at each level‚Äôs profitability, but I give near infinitely more weight to the final product spilt across the necessary bases


[13-Oct-24 10:27 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Because the stability provided by separating yourself from the instability and volatility of the market is worth quite a lot.

[13-Oct-24 10:28 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Just look at me. I ain‚Äôt poor and I do nothing but vertical integration. Ask all the Colabing folks who work with me how it works out for them. (Not necessarily the value of a IDC base, but I think 45k/permit is good for low/midtier)

Is there any tool to calculate the optimal time to send a ship somewhere to maximize the speed/fuel cost?


[18-Oct-24 07:55 AM] laaxus#0000
it depends on planets position


[18-Oct-24 07:55 AM] laaxus#0000
so no


[18-Oct-24 07:56 AM] mancules#0000
I figured, guess I‚Äôll have to figure it out the hard way


[18-Oct-24 07:57 AM] laaxus#0000
The dumb way I do it is just using 200 fuel every trip, whatever the source and destination :kekw:


[18-Oct-24 07:58 AM] marat_sh#0000
üëÜ I use time to arrive instead of fuel amount


[18-Oct-24 08:02 AM] realharvey#0000
I personally use "When is the next Time I'll check into prun and have enough time to send ships around?" To set the fuel sliders. (For me its like 2-4 Times a day)

Then I set the sliders as low as possible for a suitable timeframe. If I have to spend a lot of fuel to get an earlier window then I'll take a lower one


[18-Oct-24 08:02 AM] realharvey#0000
the ship arriving earlier on a planet doesn't give you any advantage, when you are not there to send it somewhere else


[18-Oct-24 08:08 AM] evov#0000
I agree with everything HarveyG just said. That's exactly how I do it.


[18-Oct-24 01:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
unless you're a dumb dumb and forget to send the ship earlier so your base is going to run out of supplies unless it gets there a bit earlier

I track my own CX activity over time. Not sure if/where you'd find a full list of all CX transactions though, which I guess is the raw data you'd need for what you're talking about (I think)


[23-Oct-24 02:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I think FIO is good enough. I would need a custom script, which collects the data from there and generates the reports.


[23-Oct-24 02:22 AM] realharvey#0000
I dont know if anything could actually track if something has been bought or if someone just deleted the position


[23-Oct-24 02:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the game can - but we don't have an official API yet, so we can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure, if FIO can pick those infos up.


[23-Oct-24 05:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
As far as I understood I can always pack up my stuff and move it somewhere else, right? My buildings, base, etc. 
of course I would lose some materials, but other then that I don‚Äôt see any reason to COLIQ, except I actually want to have a clean start somewhere else or on a planet you can‚Äôt setup a base anymore


[23-Oct-24 05:17 AM] evov#0000
Potentially if you started, made really bad choices and actually lost money... you could back yourself into a corner financially... that would make sense to COLIQ. But yeah, you can delete everything on the planet and get the permit back, and "most" of the materials... depending on how far through the repair cycle is.

[27-Oct-24 09:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Does anyone know how I calculate the required inputs and generated materials, if I have multiple recipes queued?
E.g. I smelt AL, which takes around 11 h and CU, which takes around 8h. Both are alternating, so my 14 SME smelt 7 CU and 7 AL at the moment. PrunPlanner and PMMG throw out the same numbers, so I‚Äôm guessing my calculations need to be off.


[27-Oct-24 09:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I though I could calculate how much a full base of a specific recipe would generate and take half of it, but that‚Äôs not the case


[27-Oct-24 09:36 AM] laaxus#0000
consider the production list as one recipe


[27-Oct-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
so, you have recipe a and b


[27-Oct-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
you sum their input and outputs


[27-Oct-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
and you multiply that by 24/(timeA + TimeB)


[27-Oct-24 09:40 AM] jcheung#0000
how are you currently doing it


[27-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
oh, i need to learn to read


[27-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
so here's the problem


[27-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
if you have a full base


[27-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
in a 24 hr period, half is 12 hrs


[27-Oct-24 09:42 AM] jcheung#0000
so you have 1.09x of one AL run and 1.5 runs of CU in those 12 hrs


[27-Oct-24 12:02 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I try that and see, if the numbers fit

you might have to take into consideration your production building repair. As your buildings age, their production starts dropping, which in turn means you use less product

[28-Oct-24 02:42 PM] pxlfox.#0000

[28-Oct-24 02:43 PM] realharvey#0000

[28-Oct-24 02:43 PM] realharvey#0000

[28-Oct-24 02:43 PM] pxlfox.#0000
well, the copper alone sells for 130.000


[28-Oct-24 02:44 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and I'm prodcing 76 AL, which adds another 50.000


[28-Oct-24 02:44 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and the base costs around 80.000


[28-Oct-24 02:44 PM] pxlfox.#0000
full CU would probably be even more profitable - but my supply isn't there yet


[28-Oct-24 02:46 PM] realharvey#0000
I personally would not increase the CU production


[28-Oct-24 02:47 PM] realharvey#0000

Uhh a database for a refined prun


[28-Oct-24 03:01 PM] razenpok#0000
Ah, no, there's no average bid and ask columns. VWAP is volume-weighted average price


[28-Oct-24 03:01 PM] razenpok#0000
7D/30D


[28-Oct-24 03:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
what's that? üòÆ


[28-Oct-24 03:02 PM] razenpok#0000
It takes each day over 30D and calculates the average, but each day is adjusted according to the traded volume


[28-Oct-24 03:03 PM] razenpok#0000
So random irrelevant spikes in price don't affect the total average


[28-Oct-24 03:04 PM] pxlfox.#0000
so it's... a normilized average price over 30d?


[28-Oct-24 03:04 PM] razenpok#0000
So, in short, it's a "reliable" average price, yes


[28-Oct-24 03:04 PM] pxlfox.#0000
good enough for me


[28-Oct-24 03:04 PM] razenpok#0000
I'm using it for cost estimations in my sheets


[28-Oct-24 03:05 PM] razenpok#0000
VWAP7D is more dynamic and catches up faster with the market tho


[28-Oct-24 03:05 PM] pxlfox.#0000
But it's the average price - not bid/ask seperate, right?

I have more than that tied up in stock üòì


[29-Oct-24 01:40 AM] evov#0000
For "long term" or baseline valuation of materials - I use a derived value model. I'll use CX values for raw materials, consumables and repairs... and derived values for everything else.

Using that model I can, at a moment's notice, look at what a ship costs me to make if I'm ok with zero profit margins on any of the planets involved. Or, what the price would look like if I wanted all the steps to have the same profitability as IDC's.

I don't use it all the time, but for complicated / compound products, it's really handy to be able to bypass whatever the CX "thinks" certain low trade volume items are "worth".


[29-Oct-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That‚Äôs some good numbers to have, too


[29-Oct-24 01:54 AM] jcheung#0000
derived as in something like, raw materials cost + consumable cost + repair cost + 25% profit margin?


[29-Oct-24 02:41 AM] evov#0000
Derived as in .. the only things where CX values are used are - raw materials, base repairs, worker consumables.


[29-Oct-24 05:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm wondering: are you considering shipping costs into your calculations and if yes, how?


[29-Oct-24 06:03 AM] evov#0000
Not in that tool, no. I don't use it for that purpose. It's primarily used as a "check" on what things should be worth... especially things that require multiple steps with fairly uncertain pricing on the intermediate steps.

I do evaluate shipping costs on a base by base system. That's where I also use localized (e.g. ANT specific pricing ) rather than global averages for prices.

Something you might find interesting ... when I was trying to do the modeling for the derived model (I called it UPI - universal price index ) .. one of the methods I tested out was looking at the cost of shipping, more specifically, the capital cost of shipping required, and adding that to the cost to build the base to get a more accurate total cost for setting up a base.

Unfortunately, the resulting numbers had virtually zero correlation to CX prices. While I think it is a very relevant metric.... cost of base + cost of ships + cost of 60-90 days of consumes + cost of 1 ship load of inputs.... use that total number to work out ROI... not just the cost of the base.... if it has near zero correlation to what everyone else thinks something is worth - it's not super useful to me so I scrapped it in favor of something that gives a better fit.

[29-Oct-24 02:07 PM] realharvey#0000
When supply and demand are in equilibrium the prices for lower tiered goods usually end up at around 50k-65k profit per permit.

What price point do you use for your calculations? If you're growing your ingredients you're still only at about 120-150 per unit of GRN/HCP/MAI


[30-Oct-24 04:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, my production calculation for C is not quite right. It takes the current GRN bid price, which would make production unprofitable. But I produce some myself, which should take the value down. 
Since the base makes profit, the real value is somewhere below the current CX bid. 
My sheets can‚Äôt really handle this scenario, but I can throw some numbers manually later and see what comes out

[01-Nov-24 09:17 PM] evov#0000
The reality is that whatever you make, you'll be competing against someone. At least with Lfabs, they're almost certainly an ongoing repair cost nearly everyone in the game needs to make or buy.


[02-Nov-24 02:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A better reality, is with whatever you do; .... You shouldn't  compete with friend/partner, rather with  some random other!. 

You'd all be better off with structuring your relationships with whatever partners you might have, to suit end-retail market prospects, so that you're not competing with amongst each another!


[02-Nov-24 03:01 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It might be a big game, but if you are all doing the same thing, you'll be competing against each other's CX.ASK orders, on the markets, every week... *since everyone here should be ANT-based?*... It's a maths questions, and a good idea in the long-term.


[02-Nov-24 03:24 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I agree, in a friendly economy, there is no need to compete against each other. But as we discussed in other channels, it is nearly impossible to calculate the market and balance it out. Especially, since not everybody in ANT is here to discuss his next steps. Therefore everybody of us guessing and trying to react to what gets thrown at us.
But I wouldn‚Äôt purposely inflate or deflate a market of a fellow CEO here. On the other hand, if there is a demand, there‚Äôs room to sell üòÑ


[02-Nov-24 03:25 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But I‚Äôm not trying to concentrate on lfabs alone, just pfabs in general. There is, as far as I see it, a limited amount of actually viable markets.


[02-Nov-24 03:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
One of those are pfabs, shipping components and consumables (and respectively the materials used to produce them).


[02-Nov-24 03:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That‚Äôs one of the reason, why everybody can produce AL on Deimos - because those markets eat it up


[02-Nov-24 03:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The shipping market is well managed by Evo, Rise and the OOG group (and probably others).


[02-Nov-24 03:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
bfabs aren‚Äôt really profitable, so nobody produces them. Lfabs are covered by the friendly corgi in your neighbourhood.


[02-Nov-24 03:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So yeah‚Ä¶ hard to find something you won‚Äôt compete with each other üòÖ

But didn‚Äôt looked to much into it so far


[02-Nov-24 03:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
pfabs seemed to be a logical step, since they eat up AL, of which I have plenty


[02-Nov-24 04:00 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
To Pxlfox... 

What you see in-game, on the CXM, is not a "friendly" economy.. It's a competitive one. 

The friendly variant is engendered through months + years of cooperation through various means of coordination, be it private, be it corporate, or be it associative (in-game co-ops).... And you will never see the exchange details on FIO, btw.

What the actual shit is going on with the carbon prices? My estimated profit in Prunplanner got more than halved.


[06-Nov-24 11:43 AM] tanda#0000
Rampant market manipulation


[06-Nov-24 12:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's because your Prunplanner instance runs off current FIO data imports, which are pulled from player snapshots off the APEX markets. 

Some would say that there is great value and peace of mind, to be had in maintaining your own production flows and price metrics (or even rules of thumb). Others simply don't care because they're running insulated businesses which don't really deal with the market prices, unless they're selling goodies.

And that doesn't look like market manipulation, more like a shortage (look at the volumes traded recently).


[06-Nov-24 12:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But I could be wrong. I'm of the opinion that C stands for cocaine, and anyone doing smelting simply wants more of it, all the time, from their local dealer (the CX).

[06-Nov-24 12:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, I do too... But not in that I want to - it's just that natural cycles of life usually have those dim moments of decay and whatnot, and I leik them. Natural occurrences keep the ecosystem healthy... In this case, it's just encourage more C production than such person can eat up daily.

As far as I‚Äôm concerned, this shows, that our C production isn‚Äôt sufficient enough - or our C stocks. One of both


[07-Nov-24 03:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
With a high density of smelting bases and the #1 producer of AL,  C might be the target of market manipulation in the future


[07-Nov-24 03:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I will dedicate at least two more permits to C production, which should eventually bring roughly 300 C / per day extra to ANT


[07-Nov-24 03:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It will take me a few months, tho ‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs not a solution for the current shortage


[07-Nov-24 03:15 AM] jcheung#0000
it's just rough that triple burn is the most profitable by volume


[07-Nov-24 03:22 AM] jcheung#0000
it would be so much more efficient to have 4 paired bases (800 c/d) on single burn than a full bore triple burn (8 bases) [600c/d]

makes C


[07-Nov-24 05:00 AM] jcheung#0000
the most efficient C production method uses triple burn, with HYFs supplying MAI and HCP and FRMs supplying GRN


[07-Nov-24 05:01 AM] jcheung#0000
this is significantly more permits than one reasonable person would be willing to place


[07-Nov-24 05:02 AM] jcheung#0000
also with multiple people you can double up FRMs and HYFs on the same planet, reducing the logistical complexity


[07-Nov-24 05:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
How are the materials interchanged? Do they have fixed rates?


[07-Nov-24 05:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Let's say I have a FRM and produce GRN, do I just provide the materials? How am I compensated?


[07-Nov-24 05:10 AM] jcheung#0000
you get H2O for free
you supply consumables
provide GRN for free
each week (sometimes two) you get a portion of the C the entire project makes, proportional to your base's contributions


[07-Nov-24 05:10 AM] jcheung#0000
(workforce consumables are taken into account)


[07-Nov-24 05:25 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Thinking about it, I would love an "Antares Carbon Initiative", which dedicates to provide a stable C market and a "emergency supply" in case somebody wants to bomb our market, again

[07-Nov-24 05:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And to have some stock to sell internally and be able to bridge price spikes


[07-Nov-24 05:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
probably - don't want to ship it too far


[07-Nov-24 06:04 AM] realharvey#0000
I believe internal C demand might be to high


[07-Nov-24 06:05 AM] realharvey#0000
My current bases eat up 800C a day


[07-Nov-24 06:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We would just need enough people producing C ‚Ä¶


[07-Nov-24 06:12 AM] jcheung#0000
Sheesh


[07-Nov-24 06:12 AM] jcheung#0000
That's a lot of c


[07-Nov-24 06:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Roughly 3 FRM 3 HYF 2 INC 1.5 RIG 1 CHP makes around 1200/d


[07-Nov-24 06:14 AM] jcheung#0000

Greetings! Welcome to ADI!


[07-Nov-24 08:27 PM] smittyventures#0000
Thank you. do ya'll recommend a good API for PU?


[07-Nov-24 08:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Uh FIO?


[07-Nov-24 08:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Then use that with PMMG


[07-Nov-24 08:41 PM] smittyventures#0000
What is the command for the local market


[07-Nov-24 08:41 PM] tanda#0000
LM ANT for the CX or LM ZV-759c for Deimos


[07-Nov-24 08:48 PM] smittyventures#0000
Lot of shipments need to be made


[07-Nov-24 08:49 PM] smittyventures#0000
Tempted to do 2. I am sure I can sell my MCG and BDE local


[07-Nov-24 08:49 PM] jcheung#0000
Look at them carefully if you plan to take them


[07-Nov-24 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000
A lot of shipping takes your whole starting cargo bay and pays pennies, so look carefully at the cost in fuel, and apply cost to get back to starting location


[07-Nov-24 08:51 PM] smittyventures#0000
I need to buy more PE, SIO, LST, and FE so going full and coming back with what I need would be smart.


[07-Nov-24 08:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Wacha need FE for?


[07-Nov-24 08:52 PM] jcheung#0000
There's a fair few people that refine FE on deimos, so you might be able to buy local too


[07-Nov-24 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
BMPs are less than ideal on deimos


[07-Nov-24 08:53 PM] smittyventures#0000
FE and LST make BBH


[07-Nov-24 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
Mmmm... okay, but just want to make sure you know FE is heavy as hell and sucks to move


[07-Nov-24 08:54 PM] smittyventures#0000
Awesome!


[07-Nov-24 08:55 PM] jcheung#0000
FE is certainly .ore popular over at vulcan but I've seen some FE appear here and there


[07-Nov-24 08:57 PM] smittyventures#0000
Well I am off to put the kiddoes to bed. I will check on everything in the morning.


[07-Nov-24 08:57 PM] smittyventures#0000
Thank you all for your help. I will be on tomorrow.

[07-Nov-24 09:11 PM] tanda#0000
if you started on Deimos, you'll probably want to use AL for BBH and BSE instead


[07-Nov-24 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
Deimos is AL smelting HQ. It does require PP2's rather than PP1's, though


[07-Nov-24 09:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
you don't start with PP2s right?


[07-Nov-24 09:13 PM] tanda#0000
I started metallurgist, so I don't know


[07-Nov-24 09:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
since it's tier 2 building I assume


[07-Nov-24 09:17 PM] jcheung#0000
No

50 MCG, 4 BBH, and 6 BSE


[08-Nov-24 08:24 PM] smittyventures#0000
100 MCG and 5 BDE on the way.


[08-Nov-24 08:24 PM] smittyventures#0000
then I plan to ship it.


[08-Nov-24 09:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
Do you have a plan for expansion? (prunplanner)


[08-Nov-24 11:34 PM] smittyventures#0000
Not at this time, but I will be looking into over the weekend. I am waiting for this production run to finish so I can take as much over as I can.

[11-Nov-24 09:27 PM] smittyventures#0000
Is it worth it if I am on Deimos to setup a RIG and food processor if I am a constructor. I know it is one less thing for me to have to buy and I can sell my access.


[11-Nov-24 09:27 PM] smittyventures#0000
I am already making my own OVE and will soon be selling my access.


[11-Nov-24 09:28 PM] smittyventures#0000
Ha ha ACCESS insted of EXCESS!!! It is one of those days.


[11-Nov-24 09:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no not really


[11-Nov-24 09:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
What do you have on Deimos again?


[11-Nov-24 09:29 PM] smittyventures#0000
H20, ALO, and O


[11-Nov-24 09:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[11-Nov-24 09:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would just wait till you have another planet

ok


[11-Nov-24 09:34 PM] smittyventures#0000
Thank you HAL98


[11-Nov-24 09:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ü´°


[11-Nov-24 09:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So it‚Äôs just RIG, COL and EXT there? Or do you have BMPs too?


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] smittyventures#0000
I do not have any of those 3 setup yet.


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] smittyventures#0000
But yes


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] smittyventures#0000
What are BMPs?


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Manufacing things


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Basic Manufacturing Plant


[11-Nov-24 09:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How to make OVE


[11-Nov-24 09:39 PM] smittyventures#0000
HA HA YES!


[11-Nov-24 09:39 PM] smittyventures#0000
It has been a long day


[11-Nov-24 09:39 PM] smittyventures#0000
Yes I have 1 BMP making OVE and one PP1 making BSE


[11-Nov-24 09:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh


[11-Nov-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs usually best to have one or maybe two areas of expertise


[11-Nov-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
PP1 is construction


[11-Nov-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
BMP is manufacturing


[11-Nov-24 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
EXT, COL, RIG are resource extraction


[11-Nov-24 09:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also it is usually best to match the CoGC of the planet (center of global commerce or something). There will be a program run there that boosts an industry planet wide


[11-Nov-24 09:42 PM] smittyventures#0000
Yeah I am planning to do EXT next


[11-Nov-24 09:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So that would be 3 industries in one planet


[11-Nov-24 09:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For efficiency that doesn‚Äôt make the most sense


[11-Nov-24 09:44 PM] smittyventures#0000
I am getting what you are saying


[11-Nov-24 09:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Since you can only have 6 experts


[11-Nov-24 09:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And none of those industries match the CoGC program


[11-Nov-24 09:45 PM] smittyventures#0000
SO I chose a bad planet for Cronstruction?


[11-Nov-24 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not bad per say


[11-Nov-24 09:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Just not the most optimal


[11-Nov-24 09:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like at the end of the day it‚Äôs a game


[11-Nov-24 09:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nothing is bad


[11-Nov-24 09:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Play how you want


[11-Nov-24 09:46 PM] smittyventures#0000
I understand that.


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So for example Nike has a CoGC doing construction


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And Hephaestus is doing manufacturing


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] smittyventures#0000
What would be a way to turn this around.


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Have you gotten a grant yet?


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] smittyventures#0000
No


[11-Nov-24 09:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Probably that would be the easiest


[11-Nov-24 09:48 PM] smittyventures#0000
And I would not feel guilty COOLiq and doing this over. LOL


[11-Nov-24 09:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or do a COLIQ or company liquidation and start over


[11-Nov-24 09:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or both


[11-Nov-24 09:48 PM] smittyventures#0000
I know it is prolly against the rules but HEY ANYONE NEED FREE STUFF LOL


[11-Nov-24 09:48 PM] smittyventures#0000

[11-Nov-24 09:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs ambiguous from the ToS


[11-Nov-24 09:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You‚Äôll get a different answer depending on who you ask


[11-Nov-24 09:49 PM] smittyventures#0000
I was kidding. I would only do that if someone had invested in my company


[11-Nov-24 09:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
üòù


[11-Nov-24 09:50 PM] smittyventures#0000

ü§ì


[11-Nov-24 09:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So before you jump your current ship and start over I would look at the industries you are interested in and make a plan


[11-Nov-24 09:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Deimos is a good place long term but might not be your immediate cup of tea


[11-Nov-24 09:52 PM] smittyventures#0000
I already am. But I am doing some research before I do it.


[11-Nov-24 09:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Welcome back


[11-Nov-24 09:55 PM] smittyventures#0000
My first was 1 day in and I lost my company trying to do shipments


[11-Nov-24 09:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Gotcha


[11-Nov-24 09:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Shipping is hard


[11-Nov-24 09:56 PM] smittyventures#0000
Second one lasted about 2 months.


[11-Nov-24 09:57 PM] smittyventures#0000
It was fun, but I was balancing that with running a real business and could not balance the two and real life was more important


[11-Nov-24 09:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Real life ftw


[11-Nov-24 09:58 PM] smittyventures#0000
Wife and kids more important. Wife is a gamer too


[11-Nov-24 09:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
üíØ


[11-Nov-24 09:59 PM] smittyventures#0000
So lets get this right this time. What is DIEMOS good for?


[11-Nov-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Metallurgy


[11-Nov-24 10:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Making metals, glass and such


[11-Nov-24 10:00 PM] smittyventures#0000
Hence ALO


[11-Nov-24 10:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah more or less


[11-Nov-24 10:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So like having a bunch of SME with some EXT/COL at the beginning isn‚Äôt crazy


[11-Nov-24 10:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or rather far from the norm


[11-Nov-24 10:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The SME will be way more profitable, but the EXT and COL greatly reduce the shipping strain with the rinky dinky starting ships


[11-Nov-24 10:03 PM] smittyventures#0000
So I collect O and ALO, SME what I can and sell the rest of what I can't?


[11-Nov-24 10:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Basically


[11-Nov-24 10:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But you could also just do one or the other for COL and EXT


[11-Nov-24 10:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think you can do 17 SME with 3 COL and it basically balances


[11-Nov-24 10:05 PM] evov#0000
Producing O and ALO on deimos, and selling it on planet isn't a bad option for newer players. One of the harder barriers for new players to overcome is the point where they need to buy a new ship. So it makes a lot of sense to start out with bases that have very low logistics needs.  i.e. - extracting stuff on a planet that other people might buy from you on that planet.

[11-Nov-24 10:05 PM] evov#0000

But your private deals are at a much lower price


[11-Nov-24 10:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
LM would be better

Everything gets used somewhere, and they are all proportional priced according to their duration. It looks like allocater has a lot of LD bids in already.


[12-Nov-24 03:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
As for CLRs, the TRN/SWF/CAPs sorta get used together, but I've been having SWF shortages and have been buying those on the CX


[12-Nov-24 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
My CLRs were switched all to MTC for a while, for gateway purposes. I would not recommend anyone do that, but it used up a lot of my supply of other CLR products üòÜ


[12-Nov-24 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I have two gateways worth of MTC, so that won't happen again

I'm happy MTC was given a use

I think universe-wide hex production  other than me is in the low hundreds. (including older than 180d)


[12-Nov-24 04:46 PM] finestone#0000
I would be interested in this what prices would you buy at. Currently filling LD bids.


[12-Nov-24 04:52 PM] finestone#0000
For current LD pricing at 9k competitive pricing would be BAI@12k and MLI@18k but i would happily do 11/17 once LD@9 is filled.


[12-Nov-24 05:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that sounds reasonable. I'm going to add some orders:
LD @ 9k
BAI @ 12k
MLI @ 18k
SAL / SA @ 6k (there's a ton of SAL @ 5.8k, so I'll buy some of that)

The electronics markets really aren't bad. I think they could support a new player or two.


[12-Nov-24 05:50 PM] finestone#0000
While on the topic I was going to start producing SOL/SP was there anything else in the ECA that has demand?


[12-Nov-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
CBL is a decent MM, but it requires a fairly specific chain set up


[12-Nov-24 06:14 PM] finestone#0000
understood thanks

Tying into the Software Development items - I have 30 SD's in the ant region. If the price is right, I'd gladly buy those products rather than make them myself. My experience has been that the CX market has no hope of suppling my needs, but I'll occasionally go shopping if I've got spare cash sitting around.

I'd be happy to buy at the prices Archiel posted - approx ->

I can't help but wonder if these should go in #internal-requests for easier searching in the future

hello ^_^


[13-Nov-24 09:54 PM] maauuu______#0000
How do you know if a planet has good soil fertility?


[13-Nov-24 09:54 PM] maauuu______#0000
im looking around at planets and deimos is orange


[13-Nov-24 09:54 PM] maauuu______#0000
is that good?


[13-Nov-24 09:55 PM] tanda#0000
It's semi visible on the PLI screen, but for best results look it up on prun planner


[13-Nov-24 09:56 PM] tanda#0000
All the bars are orange though


[13-Nov-24 09:57 PM] maauuu______#0000
hmm


[13-Nov-24 09:57 PM] maauuu______#0000
Its kinda to the left of the middle bar


[13-Nov-24 09:57 PM] maauuu______#0000
If that makes sense @_@


[13-Nov-24 09:57 PM] jcheung#0000
I use prunplanner


[13-Nov-24 09:57 PM] jcheung#0000
Way more readable


[13-Nov-24 09:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Gives fertility as a %


[13-Nov-24 10:00 PM] maauuu______#0000
Ohhh


[13-Nov-24 10:00 PM] maauuu______#0000
Looked it up now


[13-Nov-24 10:01 PM] maauuu______#0000
thanksss ^_^


[14-Nov-24 12:25 AM] jvaler#0000
yapt > prunplanner for planet search imo


[14-Nov-24 12:26 AM] jvaler#0000
unless you want CoGC readings, yapt doesn't do that...


[14-Nov-24 05:55 AM] jcheung#0000
that's one of the things that i kinda look at üòõ


[15-Nov-24 10:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just parse for targets on yapt... And then check in-game or on FIO.


[15-Nov-24 10:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's my workflow.


[15-Nov-24 10:11 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I also ask people, since newer COGCs on new planet projects, are kinda masked from the general pop, until they get like more established.


[15-Nov-24 01:17 PM] finestone#0000
or just use taiya's map ü§î


[15-Nov-24 01:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Taiya's map is actually good, for a specific purpose... Mapping our where your ships are going too, and finding synergies with shipping....


[15-Nov-24 01:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The other two aren't good for that.


[15-Nov-24 01:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a design thing... YAPT is good for aggregate searches via resource densities and basic PPS (planetary project infracture pre-existing).. FIO/PP are good for COGC searches, with resource densities, but it's a little clunky imo... If you've got the the basic data from either, you can search up how your ships are going geographically, and you can customize your strategy from there.


[15-Nov-24 01:24 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
whats YAPT? can I get a link?

wow this is nice


[15-Nov-24 01:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yeah, it's really fast... then again my strategy is just to shoot for nearest liquid H2O deposits, extract, make agri stuff, and turn into RAT/DW/OVE.


[15-Nov-24 01:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you're mixed all around, you might have a harder time figuring out what you want to do.


[15-Nov-24 01:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

[15-Nov-24 01:34 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am even simpler. Just make fuel


[15-Nov-24 01:35 PM] tanda#0000
I'm getting more focused these days, it's becoming just: Make MHL and make INS


[15-Nov-24 02:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
I only make RATs, DW, FIM, DDT, H2O, MHP, BWS, and also CL, FLX, and small amounts of INS, bfabs, and lfabs

I mean specialization isn't a bad thing. As long as it makes you money


[15-Nov-24 02:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
Agree - I actually want to narrow down my offerings a bunch, just to reduce the mental load of maintaining it all


[15-Nov-24 02:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just make PE and OFF and it's great. 4 total inputs, easy shipping. Decent money.


[15-Nov-24 02:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[15-Nov-24 03:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I did mostly. I dropped from 14 bases to just one and dropped to basic license. I'm not doing much these days other than PE, OFF, and hanging out on discord

Hello everyone!


[16-Nov-24 06:57 PM] smittyventures#0000
I just got the 3 jobs that are offered from the Antares Logistics Officer. Not sure what I am supposed to do for 2 of them.


[16-Nov-24 07:05 PM] smittyventures#0000
How do I provision the stuff


[16-Nov-24 07:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
You can think of provisioning something as setting it aside for the logistics officer / whoever you made the contract with


[16-Nov-24 07:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
And all you need to do is have the materials it asks for at the location it mentions, and click ‚Äòfulfill‚Äô on the contract üôÇ


[16-Nov-24 07:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it needs to be in a base or warehouse though, I don‚Äôt think you can provision from a ship


[16-Nov-24 07:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you share a screenshot of the contract, I can be more specific than that. But hopefully that helps üòÑ


[16-Nov-24 07:16 PM] smittyventures#0000
So I have to make it or provide it?


[16-Nov-24 07:16 PM] smittyventures#0000
That is what I was wondering.


[16-Nov-24 07:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yes


[16-Nov-24 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
if it's weird enough, you can buy it and it will work. Early on, though, those contracts are based on what your empire makes


[16-Nov-24 07:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you need to get it there somehow


[16-Nov-24 07:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
buy it/make it/appear it


[16-Nov-24 07:17 PM] smittyventures#0000
Yeah, I will get it later.

[16-Nov-24 07:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
what would you have to make / provide for these? just curious üôÇ


[16-Nov-24 07:20 PM] smittyventures#0000
So the Logistics Officer will have to wait


[16-Nov-24 07:21 PM] smittyventures#0000
3 BSE and 44 RAT for one, 44 MCG and do survey, and the last one is do a survey


[16-Nov-24 07:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll give you the BSE and RAT for free if you send the contracts üòÑ


[16-Nov-24 07:22 PM] smittyventures#0000
REALLY?


[16-Nov-24 07:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
and if it's worth the trouble to you to ship them, of course


[16-Nov-24 07:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
sure üôÇ


[16-Nov-24 07:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
if you feel like doing the contract, just send for the stuff at ANT!

[16-Nov-24 07:28 PM] smittyventures#0000
Great time to learn


[16-Nov-24 07:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can go to the bottom left, where you see 'NEW BFR', then enter CONTD in the window it opens


[16-Nov-24 07:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
that will give you a window like this, where you can save a bunch of pre-made contracts to re-use later

[16-Nov-24 07:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
since you want to buy things from me, use the 'Buy commodity' template and enter all the stuff there. just put 1 AIC for the price per unit, and make sure the location is ANT


[16-Nov-24 07:33 PM] smittyventures#0000
I will need to do 2 for the 2 different comodities


[16-Nov-24 07:33 PM] smittyventures#0000

[16-Nov-24 07:35 PM] smittyventures#0000
Are you on Deimos?


[16-Nov-24 07:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
no, sadly - you'll have to pick the things up from Antares Station


[16-Nov-24 07:41 PM] smittyventures#0000
No problem. That is even better cause I have 2 ships there.


[16-Nov-24 07:42 PM] smittyventures#0000

[16-Nov-24 07:42 PM] smittyventures#0000

Actual piracy in this game would be crazy üòÇ
And scary


[21-Nov-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
and that'd be the moment I quit the game


[21-Nov-24 10:06 AM] taiyibureau#0000
I could see an abstract way of piracy, where you'd need to carry some "weapon" consumables or else you have a percentage loss in cargo. Only applied outside of faction space


[21-Nov-24 10:07 AM] razenpok#0000
So, just a new fuel type basically


[21-Nov-24 10:08 AM] laaxus#0000
That's the prun equivalent of mojang adding a new useless block


[21-Nov-24 10:08 AM] laaxus#0000
let's not


[21-Nov-24 10:08 AM] laaxus#0000
it doesn't make the game deeper, just more complex without added value


[21-Nov-24 10:09 AM] taiyibureau#0000
Just saying that is the only way I could see "piracy" added without 80% of the playerbase quitting


[21-Nov-24 10:46 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I once shipped like 200 ABH and a bunch of electronics from MOR and I think over half my wealth was on that ship üòÖ

Lol I bet! INS isn't so compact that I can pack it all in like that


[21-Nov-24 11:56 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
In a game where are the 'conflict' is usually around CX competition and planet workforces, I could imagine 'combat' mechanics that involve bribing governments, influencing unions, tariffs, and other forms of indirect warfare

[21-Nov-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
I suspect there might be some afabs that would give PG a run for its money


[21-Nov-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000

[25-Nov-24 09:58 AM] laaxus#0000

[25-Nov-24 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, the WCB upgrades are the best option since they don't require replacement of the bridge or crew quarters, which are the most expensive parts.


[25-Nov-24 01:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
@ibumcuckets  **OR** the #psk-information  project here in ADI to upgrade your ships. *little birdy told me soonish for the first kits to roll out*

hmm mixed, retail, end-use, high tier commodities. 

That might work, but you might want to consider what sort of margins you want, instead of just selling direct to market. Those LUX goodies feed the TEC+ tiers, but of course, only those who run those higher processes "might, or might not" need them. Price points are a big thing.

Dropping internal market ads here, or elsewhere, will also increase your visibility to any potential buyers.


[27-Nov-24 09:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Super niche too. Lots of hybrid base potential. I think that its something of a mix between a farmer/victualier on Promitor, and a chemical engineer on Griffinstone, at least on the industry mix.

@tanda @akyantor I have sent some cons out let me know if there are any issues.


[13-Dec-24 06:09 AM] evov#0000
I've been thinking about the concept of warfare, or regional conflict within Prun lately. What it means, what it might look like etc. At it's core - I think I'd sum it up by - "The ability of the players from one region, to negatively impact the players of another region"

 Central to this idea is "negative impact". What things make a region better vs worse?

I think there's a number of things that are fairly clearly in the (Advantage) column. Robust and active markets, well developed planets with a good variety of cogc's in the region, active community etc.

Some things however, I'm not 100% sure what's better. For example, CX market prices.
If ANT CX prices were the most expensive of all the CX's - would people view this as good or bad? 
If ANT CX prices were the cheapest of all the CX's - would people view this as good or bad?

Currency inflation -
Is it beneficial for the ANT region if we have more AIC printed, or would that be a negative?
Same thing for the destruction of currency (e.g. buying BFabs ) - is it a benefit to the region if we buy Bfabs from the MM in ANT, or from a different region destroying their currency?

Just to constrain the scope of the discussion, I'm looking for points of view on these two items -
1. CX Prices - What's better, higher ANT CX prices, or lower ANT CX prices?
2. Inflation - What's better, more AIC in circulation, or less?


[13-Dec-24 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
oh man, let me write an essay on 1)


[13-Dec-24 07:43 AM] cptboby#0000
Can't wait to read that.


[13-Dec-24 09:12 AM] finestone#0000
Volume and availability is all I really care about. The price should always work itself out. As far as currency creation deletion it is hard to say. Would have to look at the inflation data which we dont see.


[13-Dec-24 10:05 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
1) CX ASK/BID prices don't matter... Daily traded volumes, and CX buffer inventories do (like how much volume is listed for sale, or for bid, before the market dries out on non-MM supplied goodies). You'll get a better indication of how well your regional economy is performing, and exchanging value through goods/currency.

2) AIC in circulation doesn't matter. What does is more even-distribution of said monies, so that more people can engage in the HQ upgrades, ship building/purchases, more bases, to bring in more stock to market.   -- Or in other words, when you're regional CX runs out of given fab materials for your upgrades/repairs/production inputs, your internal metrics go out of whack if you cannot produce/obtain them locally.

[13-Dec-24 10:09 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a tricky thing.. Most players, on any rate of profit/expansion, usually tend to build bases all over the place, and not just within ANT or HRT, not to mention that they can also export their production to any market of their choosing...

And we don't really have that many players capable of doing that... I'm guessing around ~1,600 players have some form of PRO/BASIC (based on UFO members last time I checked). Hardcore micromanagement is also involved in those potential schemes.


[13-Dec-24 10:09 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
üòÆ what is this utility?


[13-Dec-24 10:32 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Discord auto-formats manuscript-doc uploads? Nice. 

Per Laaxus, do IDC bases actually keep prices high, with markets calculating in potential commodity/currency metrics through time, or is price volatility/inflation more dependent on player activity on commodities being traded?


[13-Dec-24 02:33 PM] evov#0000
I agree with this. I think that Price stability + Product availability are what matters. 

So in any kind of "economic war" with other regions - the overarching direction should be... where possible/practical -

1. Bring goods/materials from other CX's into the ANT CX.
2. Create AIC, destroy other currencies if needed (since more AIC in circulation = higher capacity of CX buy orders =  Better price stability / availability on the market )

{Reactions}
üëç 

[13-Dec-24 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
I believe we should use IDC bases to make strategical reserves of input goods


[13-Dec-24 02:37 PM] evov#0000
I think, it makes sense to break down goods into 2 groups.

1. Consumes / Construction materials
2. Everything else.

I think having cheaper consumes/repairs in a region, while everything else is more expensive - is a net win for the region as a whole.

However,  having higher price, means that a part of the production is probably not local


[13-Dec-24 02:39 PM] laaxus#0000
and therefore, more vulnerable in a war


[13-Dec-24 02:39 PM] laaxus#0000
conversely, CX with low prices probably export, meaning less profit and exports but higher resilience


[13-Dec-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmm. I don't know if currency destruction will really do much


[13-Dec-24 02:43 PM] jcheung#0000
The purchasing power per unit of money is still going to be right about the same


[13-Dec-24 02:44 PM] jcheung#0000
Mostly due to people being lazy

Mmm.. Regarding currency destruction... It's a "hearts and minds" sort of thing. I'm pretty sure everyone has noticed the UFO #deals, regarding permit allocation plans/loans/deals.. 

This sort of thing has been going on for ~2+ years or so, and it's largely dictating the public/private production distributions evidenced throughout Prun, but due to API/LEAD limitations, no one has any exact data on it all....

If you'd like less AIC to be destroyed, then fund SF/FF/B-fab production in house... If not.. Well then currency creation is outpacing currency destruction anyways. The intermediate solution is to attract more business to ANT CX, by whatever means necessary, in the long-term.. I'm thus agreeing on several key points that y'all have made thus far.

Sooo, what‚Äôs the best way for one to get a IDC base‚Ä¶ asking for a friend


[16-Dec-24 06:03 AM] laaxus#0000

[16-Dec-24 06:28 AM] jcheung#0000
well


[16-Dec-24 06:28 AM] jcheung#0000
i wouldn't say hands down


[16-Dec-24 06:29 AM] jcheung#0000
if you were to take out a cash loan and look for deals you could probably get the materials for cheaper, but then you have to worry about paying the loan back in cash rather than goods


[16-Dec-24 06:51 AM] laaxus#0000
Allocater deal truly make things easier


[16-Dec-24 11:11 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I have no regrets on the allocater deal. It was probably the best early game decision I made.


[17-Dec-24 01:30 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Are you shipping your IDC yourself, or are you selling it on the LM?


[17-Dec-24 01:30 PM] pxlfox.#0000
How long did it take to get the popr filled?


[17-Dec-24 01:31 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm selling it to allocater directly whenever I want


[17-Dec-24 01:31 PM] laaxus#0000
I just send him a cont, he usually close and pay within the day


[17-Dec-24 01:32 PM] laaxus#0000
One week iirc, maybe 2


[17-Dec-24 01:33 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and you pay the loan every 7 days... so the base is probably not able to pay itself in the first 1-2 weeks


[17-Dec-24 01:33 PM] pxlfox.#0000
(which is fine, just something to keep in mind, I guess)


[17-Dec-24 01:33 PM] laaxus#0000
It does, the cont pay the first week


[17-Dec-24 01:34 PM] pxlfox.#0000
oh really


[17-Dec-24 01:34 PM] pxlfox.#0000
thats even better


[17-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
You receive 3 M as per the loan


[17-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
So the first week is free


[17-Dec-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
(however you pay 6M at the last step)


[17-Dec-24 01:35 PM] laaxus#0000
You'll have to pay for a 50d package 7 weeks in, don't forget that


[17-Dec-24 01:36 PM] pxlfox.#0000
aren't you getting 50d of consumables in the package?


[17-Dec-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
I couldn't pay for it right away, so he gave it to me, allowing me to pay the package within 30 days at no cost (I paid it within a week)
You might not get the exact same deal but it proves he's flexible


[17-Dec-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
You do


[17-Dec-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
But the Loan is 10 weeks, and 50d is 7


[17-Dec-24 01:37 PM] pxlfox.#0000
ah, ok


[17-Dec-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
well, if I can believe PP, an IDC farm alone puts out the same daily profit as all my other bases combined üòÖ


[17-Dec-24 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
Don't forget to add the corp bonus if you don't have a corp already


[17-Dec-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
just for the measly price of selling your soul for mere 50 days


[17-Dec-24 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
There's a corp for malahat


[17-Dec-24 01:41 PM] pxlfox.#0000
does the company HQ not add some bonus, too?


[17-Dec-24 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
Yes, faction bonus


[17-Dec-24 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
But pp takes Care of that automatically

[17-Dec-24 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
XD that's many free permit


[17-Dec-24 01:43 PM] pxlfox.#0000
me?


[17-Dec-24 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
Yes


[17-Dec-24 01:44 PM] laaxus#0000
Or maybe not many


[17-Dec-24 01:44 PM] laaxus#0000
I honestly forgot the math


[17-Dec-24 01:44 PM] laaxus#0000
But I know I have 12%, something like that ?


[17-Dec-24 01:44 PM] pxlfox.#0000
So the bonus is higher the more free permits I have?


[17-Dec-24 01:44 PM] pxlfox.#0000
weird


[17-Dec-24 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, what matter is, with faction and corp bonus, you'll get a healthy weekly profit even if the Loan is still not paid yet


[17-Dec-24 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
No, not weird. It's described in the handbook if you're interested


[17-Dec-24 02:07 PM] evov#0000
IDC = Great $ per permit. Not great $ per $ invested though.

I think when I built my IDC bases (I have 2) it cost 32mil each for the base + 90 days of consumables.

People with a low permit count could build a LOT of bases/productive capacity with 64mil instead of 2 IDC bases.


[17-Dec-24 02:24 PM] laaxus#0000
This is true


[17-Dec-24 02:24 PM] laaxus#0000
But it doesn't matter as the allocater deal doesn't stop you from taking Loans from lowstrife


[17-Dec-24 02:25 PM] laaxus#0000
So technically, there's no downside only benefits


[19-Dec-24 01:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But where are we gonna gossip about Benten, when this channel is deleted ? üòÆ


[19-Dec-24 01:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
On that note - know I have to collect dirty CIS to pay for production fees -.-


[19-Dec-24 07:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I usually have CIS from government payouts on Malahat (I make the MHP for the planet) - happy to trade 1:1 for AIC üôÇ


[19-Dec-24 07:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
I already found one to trade and now and will probably just sell some IDC for CIS, so I always have some for the production fees


[19-Dec-24 05:49 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
:eyes_sus:


[19-Dec-24 05:55 PM] tanda#0000
Certainly not somewhere Benten can hear us


[19-Dec-24 08:18 PM] jcheung#0000
Don't worry about north antares
