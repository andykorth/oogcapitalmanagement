Posting this old message here because the bulk of it is still valid:

```About settling new bases

High temperature, High pressure, High gravity are not possible for anyone in the game right now. The supplies simply dont exist yet. (High pressure coming soon with titanium, but damn will it be expensive)

This leaves normal rocky planets like we are all currently on, or any combination of:

    Gas planet --- AEF
    Low pressure - SEA
    Low gravity -- MGC
    Low temp. ---- INS

With these constraints, Here are my preferred planets and my reasoning for each:

Harmonia -- Easy, local, plenty of food and water, existing corporate trade route due to Tadabe and his coffee situation

KI-840c --- 5 jumps from phobos with magnesium and copper, as well as BRM and some Galerite, Extractors only

WR-681b --- 9 jumps (far) low pressure, lots of copper and some higher tier rare items. Extractor and Collector only.

Etherwind - Tadabe's favorite, best water output available.

Nike ------ Local, low pressure limestone planet. Local market already built.

Allowing for low temperature, we get some really cool shit if we can somehow get our hands on THF -> INS

    KI-401b -- Titanium, Zirconium, Iron
    ZV-639d -- Nitrogen
    AJ-293g -- Fast Fuel```

@spatial_piano @figaro0714  in the general chat wall of text I mentioned buying a base on the QJ-382e gas planet.


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think you two are most likely to be able to buy that next. We can discuss details in here if you are interested


[21-Aug-21 04:44 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Which one are you talking about again? QJ-382g is the only cold gas planet in the system with worthwhile resources. Would it be for Ammonia extraction mainly?


[21-Aug-21 09:36 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes it is qj-382g sorry i keep mixing them up


[21-Aug-21 09:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ammonia and hydrogen


[21-Aug-21 12:43 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I probably have the money for setting up the CM, but nothing else at the moment. AEF and INS are big hurdles. What are the prices for those in-corp?


[21-Aug-21 06:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
to be determined. We dont have a LAB or a source of argon, neon, thf, etc. So we need to buy THF, AR, and NE


[21-Aug-21 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At that point we can produce the INS and AEF in corp, I can get back to you on a production price for each of those 2 items


[21-Aug-21 07:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano it costs about 14 AIC per INS produced from a PP3 at 92% efficiency. Adding stem cell treatment or stellar pale ale could possibly change this cost


[21-Aug-21 07:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think @figaro0714 would want ~20 AIC per INS so he can do more than break even on technician consumables


[21-Aug-21 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also that number 14 per INS is not including the THF , Argon and PE


[21-Aug-21 08:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
When I bought week or two ago it was about 62000 total AIC for 60 THF, 60 AR and 6000 PE. This is enough for 1200 INS, which is about 51.7 AIC per ins, plus 20 AIC to Figaro.


[21-Aug-21 08:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so **71.7 AIC per INS** vs. 150 on the CX


[21-Aug-21 09:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 setting up 2 HB1 + EXT is going to require 20 BSE and 8 BBH, among other things. How long until I would be able to buy that on Nike?


[21-Aug-21 09:03 PM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape  26hrs, I have the BSE just need this BBH order to finish


[23-Aug-21 07:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Awesome. All on Nike?


[23-Aug-21 08:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling closed a contract to buy 20 Neon at a low price of 350 each. This can be used to make 20 AEF which is enough for 2 new bases on a gas planet.


[23-Aug-21 08:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I guess this guy could possibly fail the contract but otherwise we can get AEF in production this week.


[23-Aug-21 08:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano FYI ^


[24-Aug-21 02:06 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The 20AEF is enough for 2 CMs but you'd still need more for the other buildings. 18EAF gets you a CM, HB1 and a COL. If you want an EXT instead, that's 22 total.


[24-Aug-21 02:09 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll put up an ad for 31@350 each, and see if someone bites. That would cover CM, 2HB, COL and EXT.


[24-Aug-21 02:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh really? I need to double check my math


[24-Aug-21 02:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm using the RAIN spreadsheet, butr I'äm not sure it's up to date


[24-Aug-21 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
AEF is 1/3 the base area


[24-Aug-21 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
CM is 25 area, HB1 is 10 area, COL is 15 area, for a total of 50 area (65 if you want to do 2 collectors)


[24-Aug-21 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah. looks like 22 AEF for 2 collectors after all.


[24-Aug-21 02:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
welp we have the capacity to make 20 of those in corp within the week. I think you would have a harder time procuring the INS and bfabs.


[24-Aug-21 02:13 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Each of the buidings has its AEF cost rounded up I think


[24-Aug-21 02:13 PM] spatial_piano#0000
so 9+4+5*2 = 23


[24-Aug-21 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Good thing you are here to say that, it would be pretty unfortunate to show up to a gas planet with everything you need minus 1-2 AEF


[24-Aug-21 02:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Well you would be then down 1 collector


[24-Aug-21 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Another minor detail.. The Ammonia is frozen on QJ-382g, so you would need a mix of EXT + COL to get both


[24-Aug-21 02:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeap. It's super awkward Hab-wise


[24-Aug-21 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if we consider a 100/110 pioneer base with 1 HB1, it now looks like:

CM = 25 area -> 9 AEF
HB1 = 10 area -> 4 AEF
EXT = 25 area -> 9 AEF
COL = 15 area  -> 5 AEF

net 75 area and 27 AEF


[24-Aug-21 02:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Good point. Why would my workers would even need to sleep inside on a Gas Giant.


[24-Aug-21 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there will just be 100 of them in beds where they would ideally have 110


[24-Aug-21 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If 10 extra pioneers show up looking for work, they will be promptly eaten to save on rations


[24-Aug-21 02:21 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Wait I have to give them Rations? 😩


[24-Aug-21 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
"you guys feed your workers??"


[24-Aug-21 02:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Making a trip to Hortus wouldn't actually be bad. NE is abundant and cheap there.


[24-Aug-21 02:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Shipping it on contract would work as well.


[27-Aug-21 09:23 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@bitcoin_ape There's 28 Neon at 350 on CX. My order for 27 was filled.


[27-Aug-21 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea it seems A1 construction has a new neon source. Earthling has a few AEF already


[27-Aug-21 12:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
They can be sold to you though, we arent going to use them any time soon


[01-Sep-21 09:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I have been considering what our next bases should be. Not in a hurry to bring in new members or push 2nd bases on anyone, I think we are all growing well as is.

Electronics on Phobos has good potential, mainly building a few CLR to burn up carbon and silicon for starters.


[01-Sep-21 09:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also I think we are all hurting on rations and drinking water. If there are any new food processors on harmonia we might consider bringing in a new player for that one.


[01-Sep-21 11:33 PM] colerror#0000
Man, SI is expensive


[02-Sep-21 12:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is, but it is also possible to go vertical into SI on phobos quite easily.


[02-Sep-21 12:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We can move relatively cheap AL from Deimos to Phobos when buying in bulk.


[04-Sep-21 03:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So I have been looking at what remains as a hard blocker for FTL shipbuilding and I think it is down to having scientists.


[04-Sep-21 03:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you need to make WAI at a SL building which is scientists only.

[04-Sep-21 03:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
And the last two recipes down there, RAG and FIR, are needed to make all possible FTL engines.


[04-Sep-21 03:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
having either one will allow FTL engines to be built.


[04-Sep-21 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In preparation for this I want somebody to do electronics on Phobos.


[04-Sep-21 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think I will get into more advanced chemistry and cover the technetium processing and laboratory stuff


[04-Sep-21 03:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 ^


[04-Sep-21 04:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi you have also been talking about shipbuilding. The above might be interesting


[04-Sep-21 04:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano you would be in a good position to build a SKF when it is time to make some finished products. This would be months away probably


[04-Sep-21 04:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Do you mean SPF? That is definitely something I'm interested in.


[04-Sep-21 04:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes I did mean SPF


[04-Sep-21 04:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
SKF should be on Deimos with @insensless72


[04-Sep-21 04:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
he will also have an ASM at this point


[04-Sep-21 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
And I will supply the TI and ZR for those SKF recipes*.


[04-Sep-21 04:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think that Alucard998 is going into debt to get into an Appliances Factory and/or Advanced Appliances Factory


[04-Sep-21 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That isnt confirmed but I saw him making 1 AIC trades on Phobos LM for some NR which is only used to make ABH.


[04-Sep-21 04:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
*Short term* I want us to piggy back off of the Technician -> Engineer transition on Phobos as the governor builds and fund more planetary infrastructure. This will set us up to make ship building technology in in the future.

{Reactions}
😲 

[05-Sep-21 10:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone who would be interested in getting an electronics base on phobos? on what time frames?


[05-Sep-21 11:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im thinking something like HB2, HB3, CLR, SD


[05-Sep-21 11:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
potential to add 2-3 more CLR on those 2 hab units


[06-Sep-21 06:06 AM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm willing to do it if no one wants to, I've also decide to start a emergency fund for myself. I'm think 20000 AIC will do it. Anything left I want to give to help the corps or help build the base.


[06-Sep-21 08:11 AM] sempyrfi#0000
Electronics has several areas of opportunity so I could possibly do it as well


[06-Sep-21 07:44 PM] insensless72#0000
@everyone Im at a point where I can probably expand into tier 4 or 5 buildings on Deimos. So far ive seen interest in the following buildings: WEL, ASM, and FS. I want your opinions on where I should focus my attention, and what you think would be in the best interest of the corp.
An ASM would allow me access to AST (using DLRs TI) 
A FS would allow me to expand into making fuel rods 
A WEL would primarily be used for cheap TRU


[06-Sep-21 07:46 PM] insensless72#0000
At the moment im leaning towards an ASM, but that would require someone to build a SKF to buy up the AST


[06-Sep-21 08:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 Ship Kit Factory (SKF) is metallurgy which is in-spec for you on Deimos. You would not need a permanent factory. If you build up a large stock of AST/FET then you can strategically run a SKF for a week or something and then tear it down


[06-Sep-21 08:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that building is not really expensive. It shouldnt block you


[08-Sep-21 06:28 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wow you can get a FS! Another step towards ship building possibly! Won't TRU exploded in about 2 or 3 months because then everyone will have enough infrastructure and resources to start building a lot more planet improvements? Also are we going to build a HQ?


[08-Sep-21 07:43 PM] colerror#0000
Would need a good place for an HQ. Can't put it on a starter, so that's deimos, phobos, and harmonia out


[08-Sep-21 07:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror I can find us a planet for that 🙂 There are many good candidates.


[08-Sep-21 07:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The issue is we would need everyone (or mostly everyone) to commit to settling a base on that planet.


[08-Sep-21 07:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also we need to collectively buy the RFABs to make the corporate HQ


[08-Sep-21 07:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That would take about 2 PP3s (with repairs) dedicated to the HQ, not to mention PP2 and smelter capacity behind it since we would be going vertical into RFABs for this project.


[09-Sep-21 06:25 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Hmmmmmm, yea far into the future it seems


[12-Sep-21 12:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I think that Harmonia is a possibility for the corp HQ. Phobos and Deimos are ruled out because they are among the 8 starter planets.


[12-Sep-21 12:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Nike too, but we can only choose one.


[12-Sep-21 12:13 PM] colerror#0000
Harmonia is a starter planet now too


[12-Sep-21 12:16 PM] sempyrfi#0000
With proximity to Deimos Harmonia may be the better choice


[12-Sep-21 12:24 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Is it really??


[12-Sep-21 12:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh wut. I havent started in a long time haha.


[12-Sep-21 12:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If harmonia is blocked, then Nike is a good choice.


[12-Sep-21 12:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
best construction planet in the area if we can back it up with AL smelting. Build HQ and COGC to make +35% construction (before experts)


[12-Sep-21 12:50 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, it got added around the Kyle Hill wave, because everything else was filling up

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Sep-21 08:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi where do you plan to settle a 2nd base?


[13-Sep-21 08:11 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Most lik-ey Nike

[13-Sep-21 08:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Extraction only or vertical construction?


[13-Sep-21 09:14 PM] sempyrfi#0000
I plan on EXT only right now. If going vertical in the future is needed to meet demand I could possibly do it


[14-Sep-21 05:36 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Do we have any enemies that everyone should know about?


[14-Sep-21 05:48 PM] insensless72#0000
I never do business with Mumzhar

[16-Sep-21 10:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I cant remember if I have brought this to everyones attention before, but we would really benefit from a strategic (corporate) fuel refinery.

{Reactions}
🔥 (2) 

[16-Sep-21 10:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Given our Antares-only membership, the most fair planet to hold this refinery would be Deimos, and second best would be Phobos.


[18-Sep-21 11:52 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll soon have H and AMM, so we would just need to get either GAL or HAL+BOR. I wouldn't mind making a REF base on Deimos, but I would need to upgrade my HQ before that.


[18-Sep-21 11:53 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I could also provide a loan for the base/buildings if somebody else wants to do it.


[18-Sep-21 12:07 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Deimos is a good place in terms of competition, since Green Horde seems to have a REF on Phobos. Also lot of people go through Deimos often, including me.


[18-Sep-21 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea thats why i was thinking deimos is a good fuel planet, its a growing trade hub and the metal industry there requires import/export


[18-Sep-21 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
another option is going vertical fuel refining on hermes and shipping ammonia/NAB out from phobos


[18-Sep-21 05:27 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Is anyone making NAB in-corp yet?


[18-Sep-21 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
no


[18-Sep-21 05:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its not hard though, there just isnt a need to do it at this moment and i would have to source BOR


[18-Sep-21 05:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i could make a CHP in like 2-3 days and run it with experts but have been prioritizing other stuff


[19-Sep-21 07:33 AM] spatial_piano#0000
[QWNE] Lockreed | RL — 09.09.2021
AMM supply coming o line now on ZV-639e


[19-Sep-21 07:35 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Just noticed this. I think we should reconsider the AMM plan.


[19-Sep-21 07:37 AM] spatial_piano#0000
There's already 350 PIO worth of facilites on ZV-639e, and there probably be a lot of AMM coming to the market. Price is already going down.


[19-Sep-21 08:08 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@bitcoin_ape ⬆️  I still can go to QJ-382g, but if the market is going to flood with AMM soon then there may be Gas Giants that would be better.


[19-Sep-21 08:11 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Only advantage QJ-382g has against ZV-639e is that there is no need for BL, but the considering ZV is both closer to Phobos, and has 30% better concentration of AMM, QJ is probably gonna lose on the long run.


[19-Sep-21 01:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Its up to you. You will still make money on QJ but if you have another cold planet you want to aim for you can go for it


[19-Sep-21 01:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or you could sell me INS and do something else entirely.


[19-Sep-21 02:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
OE-568j is an option. Technetium production. Negative is that it requires huge amount of logistics, which I'm already very short on. Positive is that the planet is arguably the best Technetium planet that doesn't require Technetium.


[19-Sep-21 02:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Would enable more planet to settle in the future.


[19-Sep-21 02:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Would leave the AEF unused, which could go to a Hermes base.


[19-Sep-21 02:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
My thinking earlier is that we need the fuel to extend our logistics capacity like that


[19-Sep-21 02:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you wanted to manage the fuel expense on your own, then nothing would really stop you, and I would go for a fuel planet


[19-Sep-21 02:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or maybe @insensless72 would want to take a fuel planet. Either way I think that is a good move.


[19-Sep-21 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
As far as technetium, I say yes and I would be happy to prioritize a TNP over a LAB on phobos. Same experts but LAB kinda requires ammonia to justify


[19-Sep-21 02:30 PM] insensless72#0000
I could go fuel with my 3rd instead. All I need is AEF at this point.


[19-Sep-21 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you have everything to make a core module?


[19-Sep-21 02:35 PM] insensless72#0000
I would need 12 PSL and 9 NE for a core module


[19-Sep-21 02:35 PM] insensless72#0000
I have everything else


[19-Sep-21 02:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i know we talked about the PSL earlier with @spatial_piano so thats not an issue


[19-Sep-21 02:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you can get the first 12 of course


[19-Sep-21 02:36 PM] insensless72#0000
Well 9 AEF since NE doesnt really exist on CX


[19-Sep-21 02:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If I go to OE-568j I wouldn't need the AEF I already have so that would be sorted.


[19-Sep-21 02:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also we have AEF in corp now, they were originally intended for a fuel planet so they can still be used


[19-Sep-21 02:38 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Although there is another alternative planet. IY-206i. HE3 with 2,5 times the concentration on hermes.


[19-Sep-21 02:38 PM] spatial_piano#0000
would require both the AEF and the INS


[19-Sep-21 02:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 a good start on hermes would be 2 collectors and 1 refinery. let me check out this IY-206i planet


[19-Sep-21 02:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats 2 HB1 btw


[19-Sep-21 02:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
IY-206i is good but then we are back to needing insulation which has proved to be a pain in the ass 🤣


[19-Sep-21 02:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its possible but it will add a cool 80k AIC in expenses up front


[19-Sep-21 02:42 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I was thinking it as an alternative to the OE-568j, so the alternative plan would be that I go for the HE3 and we leave TC for later.


[19-Sep-21 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, yes that would work


[19-Sep-21 02:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think at the point that we are investing INS in a cold base it should provide something that we cant really get on normal planets, but if you do a direct comparison to hermes then it seems like having double the HE3 concentration is a good argument


[19-Sep-21 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so spending INS on ammonia, technetium, rarer metals, etc. is more attractive to me than getting HE3 only


[19-Sep-21 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
2 cents 🪙 🪙


[19-Sep-21 02:47 PM] spatial_piano#0000
TC would be the more interesting option, although I might have to build a STO to manage the tonnage coming out.


[19-Sep-21 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you do that, then @insensless72 could expand into HE3 on hermes at the same time


[19-Sep-21 02:56 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think if we go for TC we should have a high pressure planet lined up to take, so we have a head start.


[19-Sep-21 03:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
We're looking at 7,5 TCO/ day with just the basic consumables. One TNP can process one TCO to 3TCS (+1 O) in 28.32 hours at 100% efficiency so the one EXT running with basics would provide for nearly 9 TNPs.


[19-Sep-21 03:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
One thing I don't like about the TC plan is that we wouldn't have the LAB then.


[19-Sep-21 03:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Hell, I could let PIOs work naked and still have 4.09/day


[19-Sep-21 03:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol


[19-Sep-21 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I could still get a lab but it would be delayed. Currently im repairing on phobos and trying to get an EXT + SME on ki-401b


[19-Sep-21 03:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Technetium might be too early


[19-Sep-21 03:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im realizing titanium/zirconium is also too early so im going to half-way fall back onto iron smelting on ki-401b to absorb some of the production time


[19-Sep-21 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i will then continue to export FE and TIO to deimos/phobos for STL/TI


[19-Sep-21 03:45 PM] spatial_piano#0000
TC is different from those. Everybody wants to settle on more planets always so there is demand. Only problem is that there are no TNPs and they are a bottleneck for the whole thing.


[19-Sep-21 05:33 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I made a list of all resources on planets that need HSE and that are abov 60% of the maximum possible production per day in the galaxy for that resource.

[19-Sep-21 05:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Some notable options: ``` YK-266c (SIO 52.39, BRM 33.28)
 WU-070e (SIO 53.13, MGS 33.42, TIO 19.99,)
 IY-387a (FEO 35.21,GAL 31.39,LIO 11.93,) TSH REQUIRED
 KI-448c (GAL 28.14, TIO 14.54, H2O 11.03, MAG 3.25, CLI 1.21 )
 WU-013d (MAG 15.57, LES 6.24 [biggest in galaxy], LIO 1.88 )
 ZV-759b (FEO 35.40, H 5.26 ) Antares II```


[19-Sep-21 05:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
LES and also iy-387a look nice


[19-Sep-21 05:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is cool analysis


[19-Sep-21 06:01 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll need to think about it overnight. It would take a long time for there to be a lot of demand for TCO, so it's main usefulness would be getting the head start on HSE planets. If we can find some very good candidates I think I'll go for OE-568j, but I'm not really expecting to make my money back.


[19-Sep-21 06:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ROI seems to be 24 days assuming I can sell TCO for 1k/u


[19-Sep-21 06:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think if its too early to make your money back on TCO in a reasonable time frame then we should look at  that for a later base or just commit to supplying and shipping technetium products far and wide 🙂


[19-Sep-21 06:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think it could be hard to offload it all on the market but once you oversupply it in many places people will buy it up gradually


[20-Sep-21 02:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think the TCO is too big now. It needs to be more coordinated than a slapped together plan. If I get QJ-382g it's going to pay itself back slowly but surely. It gives us most of what what Corp needs for SF production, and later on we can do TCO -> IY-387a and we would have everything needed for SF.


[20-Sep-21 02:35 PM] spatial_piano#0000
So after having a panic attack I've come to my senses and decided to stay on target.


[20-Sep-21 03:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Also, holy shit.

[20-Sep-21 03:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Somebody already took THE best TCO planet in the galaxy.


[20-Sep-21 03:03 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's on the route between Hortus and Antares, so there wont be lack of transports going through there.


[20-Sep-21 03:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
TC plan is kill.


[20-Sep-21 03:11 PM] spatial_piano#0000
IY-387a might be a go soon though, if TCS starts to come to market.


[20-Sep-21 03:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
They have 90 workers on se-648c so it's definitely EXO+COL

[20-Sep-21 03:35 PM] spatial_piano#0000
So now Sharhold and GDP have the TCO market.


[20-Sep-21 04:08 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Anyway, I'm headed to OE-568j, unless there is some other last minute pivot we can do. I'll have full ship in bit less than 2 weeks, but I can return sooner if there is a need for cheap AMM or H. I didn't bring any COF with me unfortunately.


[20-Sep-21 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Stupid question, how do I search for a planet?


[20-Sep-21 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
what is this about OE-568j ?


[20-Sep-21 04:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Basically TC plan is kaput


[20-Sep-21 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 there is no goo way to do it in game. I use fio.fnar.net/planetsearch


[20-Sep-21 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea im following that. No TC for us


[20-Sep-21 04:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so you are going for the AMM + H planet in QJ?


[20-Sep-21 04:11 PM] spatial_piano#0000
https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch is also good. it feels a bit faster than FIO


[20-Sep-21 04:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
yep that's waht I meant to say, QJ-382 g


[20-Sep-21 04:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have like 5 different planet names going through my copypaste cycle


[20-Sep-21 04:13 PM] insensless72#0000
If yorue going QJ im going Hermes with fuel production


[20-Sep-21 04:14 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill just buy everything I need through you


[20-Sep-21 04:23 PM] insensless72#0000
Or was that your plan @spatial_piano ? Just realized I might be stepping on your plan


[20-Sep-21 04:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah I'm going to QJ. If


[20-Sep-21 04:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
hermes is not required but before mark settled on getting QJ i thought we needed a cheap backup plan to get into fuel refining


[20-Sep-21 04:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can still do both but with the ammonia source we have some added flexibility


[20-Sep-21 04:29 PM] insensless72#0000
I just realized that If Marky was going QJ then his intent is probably to focus fuel there, which didnt click for me until after I said I was going Hermes


[20-Sep-21 04:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm probably not going to build a REF there, at least for now. It is an option, but for now it's just extraction.


[20-Sep-21 04:32 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Although I dunno, it's not a bad idea, if we just have a source of GAL.


[20-Sep-21 04:34 PM] insensless72#0000
NAB is an option. Ive been debating whether to build a CHP or not


[20-Sep-21 04:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If we go NAB then it doesn't make sense to have the REF on QJ. Either you would have CHP and REF there which costs a lot of INS, or you'd put both REF and CHP somewhere else. Otherwise you'll be hauling H off just to turn it into NAB and haul it back again.


[20-Sep-21 05:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
For GAL the options would be ZV-307a, KI-448c, QJ-382c or IY-387a, all of them having their good sides. ZV is basically on top of ANT and doesn't require HSE (but does require TSH). KI-448c is in hermes system and has a better yield. IY-387a has the best yield, and also good amount of FEO, but isn't near anything and requires TSH. QJ-382c has the worst yield out of these, but has a lot of different materials and is in the same system as QJ-382g, so everything would be in one place.


[20-Sep-21 05:07 PM] spatial_piano#0000
TSH is very expensive, but it is doable right now.


[20-Sep-21 05:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think plan for extraction only on QJ. You will be flying back and forth from phobos which is where the CHPs will be


[20-Sep-21 05:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
building CHP + refinery on a cold planet is not worth the insulation and you would have a hard time with settler populations on an empty planet


[20-Sep-21 05:11 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah the SET would be a problem


[20-Sep-21 05:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think that means that QJ-382c is off the cards as well.


[20-Sep-21 05:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im not in front of the game right now, i cant check these planets mid discussion

[20-Sep-21 05:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
eh. doesnt look great imo


[20-Sep-21 05:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, it has variety, but it's too expensive and doesn't really excel at anything


[20-Sep-21 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I guess in my head im leaning towards refinery base on phobos or deimos


[20-Sep-21 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or if somebody really wanted they could go refinery + CHP on hermes and do ammonia/hydrogen shipments from QJ


[20-Sep-21 05:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
How would you make the trade tho? There's no LM on either QJ or Hermes.


[20-Sep-21 05:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I guess you could transport to KI401 LM and make the trade there


[20-Sep-21 05:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ill buy an LM if thats the only blocker


[20-Sep-21 05:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
They are not so bad


[20-Sep-21 05:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Fair enough, although shipping H doesn't necessarily make sense when ki401 is right there. Anyway I'm off to bed.


[20-Sep-21 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
true, H is more flexible and could even be brought from phobos


[20-Sep-21 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
have a good one, thanks for all of the info and analysis up there. Will be good to read through again

Interesting


[16-Oct-21 01:28 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone there has been a development. Earthling has bought the LDE off of me and will use them to build the LAB on phobos faster than I would be able to


[16-Oct-21 01:31 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also the HB3 is already built on Earthling's base so quite close to dropping the LAB. I now have a CHP up and have a plan for acquiring HAL to get cooking with some good recipes


[16-Oct-21 03:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I have just learned that Rayleonard has removed 2 WEL (Welding plants) on Deimos to "Pursue a different venture".


[16-Oct-21 03:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think this is creating a bit of a TRU supply problem. I think vertical AL is a really strong option for a base on Deimos.

Currently we continue to buy and ship AL/ALO from Deimos and depend on other corporations to supply our AL.

One notable exception of course is  @insensless72 Who has extremely valuable vertical construction and already shares the AL wealth with the corporation.

[17-Oct-21 04:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Vertical AL is a good way to go. I only have 2 EXT on Deimos and its enough to fuel 4 SME. This could be a solid choice for someone who is making a lot of C


[17-Oct-21 04:10 PM] insensless72#0000
I ship all of mine to Nike to make bfabs, but the price of AL itself has remained fairly stable around 400-450ea


[17-Oct-21 11:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I have found a vertical carbon player who is interested in joining us on Phobos. There is potential for them to change industry but for now it would be more carbon

[24-Oct-21 09:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is permanently stuck in Antares 1 (phobos/ANT system) since it has STL engines only. No jumps to other stars

[25-Oct-21 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is one of the closest and easiest planets which isnt a starter planet (no corp HQs on starter worlds) and is great for construction

I have made this map for anyone unfamiliar with the area and locations of our local planets:

The white route goes outwards towards the more distant planets, and the gray route lines show the standard ANT --> BEN path


[25-Oct-21 05:44 PM] insensless72#0000
I love the map @bitcoin_ape I have my construction centered on Nike, if anyone plans on expanding there lmk and I can basically provide you a base when your ship lands


[25-Oct-21 06:22 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yeah, I would definitely want to make a base on Nike. What do you think the cost for each member would be? I can help chip in AIC because this is a major operation for the corps.


[25-Oct-21 06:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At current CX prices, im getting about 65-70k to build a core module on Nike including 100 MCG and 25 SEA


[25-Oct-21 06:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Then you would need some production buildings. Simplest one is HB1 + EXT to extract and sell limestone


[25-Oct-21 06:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
construction is another good option, but if we get enough members on planet you can really do anything since we will have frequent shipments


[25-Oct-21 06:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can make sure the PG is supplied at low/no cost for any expansions on Nike, it requires about 1200 PG to build the Core Module `BUI CM`

I think hes talking about the HQ. If thats the case then way more than 70k. Its going to take rfabs if I remember right


[25-Oct-21 07:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh HQ expense is going to be pretty high. I might try to build a PP3 on Nike just to start producing into that.


[25-Oct-21 07:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
To justify it we would first need multiple bases on planet. I will make my 3rd on Nike


[26-Oct-21 03:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
My recent conversation with Rayleonard:

```mememan — 10/24/2021
ManoftheSea said you may be interested in some ZIR. If so, what kind of quantities and timeframe are you looking at?

Lockreed — Today at 5:03 AM
I am interested, looking for 40 of em, no rush```


[26-Oct-21 04:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ZIR is refined into ZR, which is exclusively used for advanced fuel rods and FTL fuel tanks.

Assuming I am not getting trolled, Lockreed is actually gearing up to build a FTL ship.


[26-Oct-21 04:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
which implies upcoming demand for all sorts of electronics and specialty items.

I would like to brainstorm some production lines that lead to the ship building industry


[01-Dec-21 07:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think electronics base on phobos has many good options, like cleanroom to make NFI. Also software buildings.


[01-Dec-21 07:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Another is metallurgy on Deimos, mainly aluminum smelting and hull welding.


[01-Dec-21 08:15 PM] insensless72#0000
An FS on Deimos would be helpful as well


[01-Dec-21 08:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[01-Dec-21 08:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and of course the metallurgy bonus


[01-Dec-21 08:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We are missing some items from an AML and various electronics buildings to produce complete spacecraft components. 

@insensless72 you should try to get some W, that will open the door for producing FTL emitters in house

[02-Dec-21 10:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We will all be negatively affected by this, though. @spatial_piano is specialized in manufacturing on Phobos and produces much of our BMP and WPL items.


[02-Dec-21 10:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He would lose the +25% manufacturing bonus in this case.


[04-Dec-21 05:29 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I'm not really in phobos sphere of influence to care much, but Marky basically supplies my GF to make glass. If he switches over then maybe I can try to find another person to fill his spot, but there is a lot to think about the situation. I mean this all depends on whether rain9441 can get enough people to help him with this effort and to also switch over I think.......


[04-Dec-21 05:29 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Also you DLR supply my SIO


[04-Dec-21 05:35 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@megasaberexe I'm probably going to keep manufacturing on Phobos even long after the bonus switches. I might move some BMP production to other planets, but I'm planning to eventually have a SCA on the planet.

yea go to cx


[13-Dec-21 06:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
landing and taking off is the worst in terms of fuel cost. If you are already in orbit its not really worth it to land and take off again


[18-Dec-21 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano do you have any input on fuel refining bases?


[18-Dec-21 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh I see in the logistics channel your update 😆


[18-Dec-21 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano would you prefer to buy large amounts of HE3 from a resource extraction base? Or do you think it is best to have a vertical fuel base?


[18-Dec-21 02:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on the cold planet I think the vertical fuel base may be too expensive with INS..


[18-Dec-21 02:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
too many buildings


[18-Dec-21 02:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, and you'd still have to import H. Having multiple refineries speeds up the experts, so having many refineries on a normal planet is better.


[18-Dec-21 02:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Having 1 refinery on the planet might be worth it tho since the FF recipe is super weir in terms of weight and volume.


[18-Dec-21 02:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
FF takes 6m3/0.37t in but is 1m3/5t out. that means that turning some of the HE3 to FF on site makes for very efficient transportation.


[18-Dec-21 02:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000
No actually it's just 2m3/0.29t in since H has to be imported.


[18-Dec-21 02:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is a close call. I think with fair, regular shipping and buying arrangements between you and Earthling would make the specialized bases more efficient


[18-Dec-21 02:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but the vertical base is lower risk and has some added utility


[18-Dec-21 02:42 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I did the math. If you turn 15% of the HE3 to FF on site you can haul about 489HE3+8800FF and you would save 15% on transport, but it's hard to say if that is worth running the ref at lower efficiency and/or higher maintenance cost.


[18-Dec-21 02:44 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Let me double check, I may have made an error


[18-Dec-21 02:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have a whiteboard. but there is some work being done in the house right now. Mobile warrior ⚔️


[18-Dec-21 02:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it really is a spreadsheet question though.


[18-Dec-21 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
saving money on transport and burning your own fuel “for free” is very convenient and is what I meant by added utility. I think there will be low cost FF available either way in this situation.


[18-Dec-21 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but there is more admin work to make consistent trades, shipping contracts, communications, etc.


[18-Dec-21 02:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
taxes..


[18-Dec-21 02:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok, i rechecked and it's actually  412/8800. you need to process 30% of your HE3 on site, but the transport savings are still about 15%


[18-Dec-21 03:01 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Or to be more accurate, processing UP TO 30% of HE3 to FF on site gives proportional saving on transportation costs.


[18-Dec-21 03:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Processing more than that doesn't give benefits.


[18-Dec-21 03:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Interesting. This is a useful result, and good point that the shipping weight/volume could be efficiently combined.


[18-Dec-21 03:06 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Actually REF processes HE3 really fast so even 1 might be overkill. How fast are refs without Settlers?


[18-Dec-21 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
75% pio and 25% settler


[18-Dec-21 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
60 + 20


[18-Dec-21 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on hermes it is overkill


[18-Dec-21 03:09 PM] spatial_piano#0000
So without Settlers, 1 ref can process material from 1 COL on IY-206i


[18-Dec-21 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on IY it is like 2.5 collector to 1 REF


[18-Dec-21 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh. i was doing simplified calculations


[18-Dec-21 03:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
100% eff.


[18-Dec-21 03:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
9.95 H3 can be processed without settlers, and 10,06 produced /COL with 100% eff


[18-Dec-21 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
now that I think of it I must have been using numbers for hermes. That checks out on IY


[18-Dec-21 03:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so for your previous point this would be efficient at 3 or 4 collectors and 1 REF on IY


[18-Dec-21 03:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
where you would be refining 33% or 25% of your HE3, respectively


[18-Dec-21 03:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. You could do HB1+HBB 3COL+REF

{Reactions}
🤯 

[18-Dec-21 03:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Actually screw the HBB, if you are not going to get settlers


[18-Dec-21 03:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
2HB1 is probably better


[18-Dec-21 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
HBB could be useful later when scaling up more collectors and more refinery throughput


[18-Dec-21 03:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
more space efficient habitation, which means cost reduction on INS 🙂


[18-Dec-21 03:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Definitely. I don't know how fast settlers come in so it may be a while before they are useful.

it seems the most effective thing at first is to have open jobs


[18-Dec-21 03:20 PM] spatial_piano#0000
There's a lot of unemployed settlers on Phobos and they might migrate pretty fast actually.


[18-Dec-21 03:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
HB1+HBB+4COL+REF seems like the best setup. you would be missing 5/180 pioneers, but you would have a good ratio even when the settlers come in.


[18-Dec-21 03:40 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sorry I'm mixing up Collectors and RIGs, you would need 2 HB1 in that setup, but you would have all the pioneers


[18-Dec-21 03:42 PM] spatial_piano#0000
it's actually easy to split into smaller expansions like 2*(HB1+2COL)+(HBB+REF)


[18-Dec-21 04:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I did some more calculations. The transportation savings don't completely offset the extra maintenance costs. Basically losses vs normal planet go from 0.44/FF to 0.32/FF. Of course the cost/FF isn't that big in the first place so I think having the 1 REF there isn't a big deal, and offers versitility since you can sell some FF to nearby systems.


[18-Dec-21 04:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Here's my calculations.

Looks good mark, thanks for sharing the results. 0.3/FF sounds very promising


[19-Dec-21 12:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone In general, shipping is becoming a bigger burden on the game economy.

This is happening naturally, I think, as a result of more settled planets total and more complicated supply chains.


[19-Dec-21 12:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you have spare fuel and idle ships, I encourage you to look at local shipping orders on ANT CX, and on local markets that you are willing to pick up from.


[19-Dec-21 02:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@spatial_piano Im looking into producing ALE on Harmonia, which means I would need an AMM connection


[21-Dec-21 09:21 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@insensless72 Yeah I got plenty of AMM. Even with expanding to 3 REFs I have about 14 AMM/day surplus from my own production, as long as I'm using the NAB for SF production. Where would you like to pick them up?


[21-Dec-21 09:28 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Tell ya huwhat, if you pick 200 AMM and 300 H from QJ-382g directly and drop the H to CX or Phobos, I'll sell you the 200 AMM for 7k. Or just give you 85 AMM as transport payment if you prefer.


[21-Dec-21 09:34 AM] insensless72#0000
That works, next time I have a ship ready it'll send it your way!

In order to make 1 BMF and 16 BWS (needed for a COGC) and assuming that your buildings are all running at the same efficiency These are the proportions of buildings that you will need to run the process (standardised to a time in a cleanroom).

ELP    4.006139678

FS    0.6606998673```


[21-Dec-21 12:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you want to do vertical production into more advanced electronics, you need to start with a cleanroom and one of the SCA or MCA


[21-Dec-21 12:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also there are these software buildings which you can run on the side for the cost of consumables only:

TRN, SWF, MWF, CAP, NCS, NFI are all made of Carbon and simple metals.


[21-Dec-21 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
These all feed into more advanced electronics consumables, components, etc in the other electronics buildings


[21-Dec-21 02:04 PM] domicius#0000
Stuff to check out for sure. Need to make plan


[21-Dec-21 03:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 @insensless72 we need to determine a price for ASE and also figure out how we will get NCS from a cleanroom in order to make ATA


[21-Dec-21 03:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@domicius interestingly you would be able to help us by getting a cleanroom early... Big commitment from you though, because you need to make a profit from that point onwards.

Otherwise we buy at 32.50 AIC per NCS


[21-Dec-21 03:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Past sales for ASE were around 18k each.


[21-Dec-21 03:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think its easiest to start with the price of an RSE and titanium since those have market rates established by now


[21-Dec-21 05:36 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Nice, a updated corps wide production sheet. Thanks for making this @bitcoin_ape


[21-Dec-21 06:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Happy to!


[21-Dec-21 06:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe when will you go to ANT station next?


[21-Dec-21 08:44 PM] domicius#0000
Let me check all this out and see if I understand it tomorrow. I kinda had in mind that I needed a cleanroom, but don't know anything about it yet!


[23-Dec-21 05:34 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  Not sure but probably within 2 weeks because I'm low on OVE and EXO, which I will probably buy from Marky again.


[23-Dec-21 06:18 PM] domicius#0000
You know, if we ever get to making ships, it will probably need to be Corp level sales - ie we take an order from the customer, produce all the parts and submit, and everyone gets a share  of the revenue based on input costs and operation time.


[23-Dec-21 06:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea its not really feasible for one person. I think we will start by producing subsystems and components needed for ships and selling those normally


[23-Dec-21 06:30 PM] domicius#0000
Makes sense - although we might need to advertise anyway, rather than go on the CX. As someone just said on the main chat, there's mo liquidity in ship parts on the exchanged because they are being made to order. If we can identify who is currently making ships, we can approach them and offer them a deal

[23-Dec-21 06:30 PM] domicius#0000
Heh, although let me get profitable first...


[23-Dec-21 06:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am familiar with some of the rich players. Also the limiting component is a WAI, so watching the development and transfer of those items will reveal who is in the process of building ships

Hello 
I just joined with my corp mates to you. So let me introduce
So I played before restart. Before I was in AHI corp, but they focus too much on benten region, so I quit, but still doing business with them (majorly with Kapusta). I am major strategic of corp. 
So Gazprom it is my brother in law, and Nutrien it is my friend. We all working together as well. We are from Poland. I am living in uk. We majorly communicate on slack. I am most active on prun, they are little lazy 🙂 
Our planets
Deimos 
Yorkshire - full 1000 base - 14 PP2 and 20 SME, majorly producing Lfabs + BBH and BTA
Gazprom - full 1000 base - ALO, C and O for smellting
Nutrien - full 750 base - small AL, C, O + TRU
Nike
Yorkshire - full 500 base - 10PP2 + 2PP3 + 1 PP4, majorly BSE, INS Rfabs and Afabs
Nutrien - full 500 base - LST + BDE  + FLX
Harmonia
Gazpom - full 1000 base - RAT production
Nutrien - full 1000 base - DW production
Yorkshire - in plan 500 base for more RAT + DW and KOM 
Phobos 
Gazprom - full 1000 base - producing C, O, BCO, SFK, MFK, HCC, GL, RG, NG, FE, STL, CU, AU, FEO, SIO 
Nutrien - full 750 base (1000 in few days) - PG, NL, PE and SF, after upgrade also CL, COT
Yorkshire - 80% of  1000 base - Next week I put APF and start producing LOG. So now I got as well 4 SD, SCA, MCA, 7 PPF, WPL (for KV), 3 LAB (for THF, TCL), CHP for CL,  2 CLR, 2 ELP ( BMF and BMS), and 3 BMP (MCG, OVE, EXO, REP, PT, PWO, SEA) 
Griffistone 
Yorkshire - 4POL for EPO and 1 LAB for  DDT 
Antares II g 
Yorkshire - 14 COL, but still adding more - H production. Also 50% of COGC prepared 
Our short plans are 
COGC on antares II g, one more APF on Phobos, Expand Nutrien base on phobos, and set up one more  Harmonia


[25-Dec-21 09:04 AM] dasefx1#0000
In corp I am happy to invest or borrow to build stable source of resources
If someone still have HQ upgrade only with Bfabs, and want play long, and be stable source, I am happy to do business even now
Now I am looking for stable source of 
CUO and SCN - so KI-840c
MG and small AUO - so QJ-650c (also can be I from CLI, so we can do MHL, if someone is intrested to produce COF in corp) 
AR - so KI-401d


[25-Dec-21 09:30 AM] domicius#0000
Hi Yaro! I am based in the UK too. Just started mind, so not producing much more than MCGs, O, C.

[25-Dec-21 10:36 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is very exciting, I think you 3 will be a huge addition to our corp. I will be happy to discuss this in detail but I am extremely busy today with holiday stuff


[25-Dec-21 10:50 AM] insensless72#0000
Hell yeah guys those are awesome bases. I'm in the same position as DLR but I pinned a message in this chat that contains an updated sheet on our current Corp bases and the production lines established on them

[26-Dec-21 08:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[26-Dec-21 08:46 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have been pushing for some of our smaller members to expand to a new base, now that we have you with some electronics industry, we have a window to expand into electronics raw materials as you said, and also for new electronics buildings on phobos to fill the gaps in those production lines


[26-Dec-21 08:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Myself, Insensless, Earthling and MarkyMark all have 3 bases. Earthling is planning to build 4th base on a cold HE3 planet to get fast fuel production


[26-Dec-21 08:54 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I want to focus on developing new bases for the smaller corp members while pushing the HQ on Nike.


[26-Dec-21 08:56 AM] dasefx1#0000
HQ most profitable can be on phobos, as electronics there


[26-Dec-21 08:56 AM] colerror#0000
Can't put HQ on Phobos


[26-Dec-21 08:56 AM] colerror#0000
Can't put it on a starter planet


[26-Dec-21 08:56 AM] dasefx1#0000
good to know 🙂


[26-Dec-21 08:57 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The QJ base for gold and copper is interesting. I need to re-examine this position (hopefully with some help😁) because the new members have brought so much more production capacity. It changes things!


[26-Dec-21 08:58 AM] dasefx1#0000
in previous corp we used google sheet which was shared. They had own bot, own pricing. I keep this pricing, as I trade with Kapusta on this pricing always


[26-Dec-21 09:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We do not have a shared spreadsheet yet, but it may be a good time to get one made


[26-Dec-21 09:07 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For prices, we generally base them on the CX market rate (minus a little bit for corporate discount)


[26-Dec-21 09:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For larger trades, or for advanced items that are not on the CX, we will base the price on first principles/cost analysis for whoever produced and shipped the items.


[26-Dec-21 09:10 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am interested in collaborating on a spreadsheet. Currently I maintain a “dumb” sheet which just lists everyones production buildings per planet.


[26-Dec-21 09:11 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also have a small personal sheet that has some vertical production profit calculators for a few items that we make with a 100% vertical setup.


[26-Dec-21 09:11 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you have any suggestions for a corp-wide shared spreadsheet, I am listening 😁


[26-Dec-21 09:12 AM] dasefx1#0000
I will think and let you know ;)\


[27-Dec-21 04:23 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think we can start from moving current excel to google sheet, and give access to all members by link to it. Than we can together improve it. I think we should have what production members had. Pricing sheet where you can get what, and requests

[27-Dec-21 04:33 AM] dasefx1#0000
Also I was thinking that I will share few things which I use, which help me play 🙂
1. https://fio.fnar.net/ Great thing for planning, searching planets. If we share access to inventory with one person from corp, than everyone can see others inventory as well, thanks to this connection. In previous corp everyone use it, and Saganaki prepared link for corp members, where he connect all of them, and you can check inventory, production and where is flight 
2. PMMG Beautifier chrome extension - great as this tool is showing landing times, calculate on LM what is price per unit etc
3. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPa0RJcCT3LTUs7eVmcw2tJwP5yZ3TsQBR07GufVIlU/edit#gid=1884208544 + own excel probably 90% of prun members use to manage they bases. I personally use only my own excel, as  I am excel lover 🙂 
4. other interesting things to check are on handbook  https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/community-resources/

[27-Dec-21 04:47 AM] domicius#0000
I use FIO. Its good for finding shipping contracts too. I'll try the chrome extension - i was wondering about it. I think I'm a ways off from needing the base planner right now, but I can see how it is useful if you have a proper plan.


[27-Dec-21 05:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
do base plan from beginning 🙂 than expanding is easier 🙂 as without it is easy to do out of stocks 🙂


[27-Dec-21 05:54 AM] dasefx1#0000
About investment & loans. I will copy same model what I get from Kapusta when I start playing again prun. I expand fast thanks to this. And both of us win win 🙂 
So I will provide 20 days loans for bfabs, lfabs, psl, tru, mcg etc, which I will provide you very cheap. I will expect some amount of products in cheap price to be provided regularly to me, rest you can resell 🙂 
So let's start from pricing
BSE - 600 
BBH - 800
BDE - 800
BTA - 500
LSE - 3300
LBH - 1200
LDE - 3300
LTA - 1200
TRU - 150
MCG - 12 
PSL - 1200 
SEA- 75
from QJ-650c I need only 
550 MG every 10 days delivered to phobos at price 30 p/u
10 AUO every 10 days delivered to phobos at price 120 p/u
So probably one EXT and one BMP can fill all my demand
However from MG I suggest to set up POL and do many PG as it is always with good demand and pricing, plus you can extract CLI, as it is more demand on CX or change it to I, and than to MHL (MHL always had demand) 
from KI-840c  I need only 
45 CUO every 10 days delivered to phobos at price 120 p/u 
10 SCN every 10 days delivered to phobos at price 500 p/u 
CUO (ext cost is 30 p/u, major cost is transport)  and SCN is few times overpriced, as now we have  monopol. So good profit on CX. (CU is too heavy to transport so best is to transport CUO, or SCN or eventually BCO).  
I will  support creating full base, so rest you can sell on CX or LM. Products can be delivered every 5 days or 20 days, no difference
All pricing for me, I checked that you will be profitable. But more profits will be on excess 🙂 
Also I can support chain for
NR as I need 45 daily 
NAB as I need 25 daily
RCO as I need  10 daily 
FF as well 🙂
AR base later on I can support as well, as most INS I conusme for antares II g now
If someone interested can write to me on priv. You can create base how you like it, and I will provide fabs. Some will need few days to produce, some I got now. Thanks to popolous best is to do in batches. for example every week add more buildings 🙂


[27-Dec-21 06:05 AM] dasefx1#0000
it will be like cash injection 🙂 Current cash you will spend only on consumables, and 20 days is long time (with many batches it is easy to move it with time more) , profits from this projects will repay loans easy 😉


[27-Dec-21 06:08 AM] dasefx1#0000
I can advice on planning bases 🙂 as I am good in this


[28-Dec-21 05:10 AM] domicius#0000
This being my first game, I'm still figuring things out - so once I know what I am doing, planning will be easier. The loan offer is interesting

I have some strategy/operations items to discuss with each of you, and have not had a good opportunity to sit down and talk since I have been travelling.

On Friday, Dec 31  at noon UTC time (7am EST) I will be on a 5 hour plane ride. This will be a great opportunity to discuss the game and I hope that you can make some time for discord chat.


[29-Dec-21 11:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The subject is mainly base loans, Nike development, and developing some spreadsheet resources to share in corp (yaro).


[29-Dec-21 11:23 PM] colerror#0000
noon UTC is a bit early for me, so if you want to schedule me later 😄


[29-Dec-21 11:24 PM] colerror#0000
I've currently got about 60k, and I'm good on consumables for at least 2 weeks, so I should be able to set up on Nike without too much lead


[29-Dec-21 11:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
later is fine, i will have a solid 3-4 hours starting at noon UTC


[30-Dec-21 03:32 AM] dasefx1#0000
for me should be fine both times 🙂

@bitcoin_ape I will be free on the 1st of next year, sorry for the late reply


[02-Jan-22 07:03 AM] dasefx1#0000
KI-448b Hermes is good planet for HE3 extraction. Only need AEF (I will try to get AEF) , so I can invest in HE3 extraction or FF chain there 🙂 Electronica is good for BOR, so creating NAB than SF, also I can invest 🙂


[02-Jan-22 08:09 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 Earthling is going to settle IY-206i for HE3. It is a cold gas planet which adds to the cost but the helium concentration is quite good


[02-Jan-22 08:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This shouldnt stop you from settling hermes but maybe it informs your decision 😁


[02-Jan-22 08:45 AM] dasefx1#0000
I was also thinking about IY-206i, but hermes is cheaper that's why I think about it more. However. IY-206i is close to electronica, which is good for NAB, so maybe IY-206i is better choice


[02-Jan-22 08:47 AM] dasefx1#0000
Gazprom was thinking about HE3, however, if eathling is going to do FF, than it is pointless 🙂


[02-Jan-22 09:56 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Initial investment on IY is higher, but operational costs per unit of HE3 produced are about half of that of Hermes even with the increased maintenance costs (60/HE3 VS 115/HE3 at current prices). Refining of course isn't that great on IY, but even there the cost increase from maintainance is only about 0.45/FF VS refining on Phobos, and about 0.18/FF VS Hermes, which isn't a massive increase.


[02-Jan-22 10:09 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think best refining should be on phobos or electronica for it


[02-Jan-22 10:09 AM] dasefx1#0000
HE3 can fit 500 per ship


[02-Jan-22 10:09 AM] dasefx1#0000
so quiet enough 🙂


[02-Jan-22 10:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
on anatares C we can do refinery


[02-Jan-22 10:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
import BOR from electronica or NAB


[02-Jan-22 10:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
H I got almost full ship daily on antares II g


[02-Jan-22 10:11 AM] dasefx1#0000
only we need involve few people in this process 🙂


[02-Jan-22 10:13 AM] dasefx1#0000
or all refinery on electronica


[02-Jan-22 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Which planet code is antares C?


[02-Jan-22 11:15 AM] spatial_piano#0000
ZV-307c I guess. It'


[02-Jan-22 11:16 AM] spatial_piano#0000
It's the one with the shipyard


[02-Jan-22 11:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1  when do you want to build these bases?


[02-Jan-22 12:02 PM] dasefx1#0000
yes 307c, they want create there Manufacturing COGC, and changes phobos to electronics

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Jan-22 12:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
our corp can have most votes on COGC, as me, gazprom and nutrien already it is 6400 votes, so we can block it or change with them 🙂 for me now better manu on phobos, but I can do elec if I move to antares C


[02-Jan-22 12:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
so we can decide together


[02-Jan-22 12:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
and I don't have plan, when to put all bases, with time I want to expand 🙂


[02-Jan-22 12:06 PM] dasefx1#0000
invictus already have HQ upgrade 13, and for 14 is required LOG


[02-Jan-22 12:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think we can have a similar voting situation on Nike


[02-Jan-22 12:07 PM] dasefx1#0000
Yes, but construction on nike is most profitable 😄


[02-Jan-22 12:07 PM] dasefx1#0000
so if someone want change we can block 😄


[02-Jan-22 12:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also governorship


[02-Jan-22 12:07 PM] dasefx1#0000
however with antares c and phobos we should make some decision


[02-Jan-22 12:07 PM] dasefx1#0000
true, ADM is easy to set up, from what I checked


[02-Jan-22 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We are already on board to convert Phobos to an electronics planet, but previously we did not have much plans or capacity to build bases on 307c.


[02-Jan-22 12:08 PM] dasefx1#0000
I chedked that more than half ADM is already contributed


[02-Jan-22 12:09 PM] dasefx1#0000
on nike


[02-Jan-22 12:10 PM] dasefx1#0000
so if we are on board, I will set up next base on antares C


[02-Jan-22 12:10 PM] dasefx1#0000
and maybe gazprom or nutrien will do same, I am not sure


[02-Jan-22 12:10 PM] dasefx1#0000
O nike ADM only LDE, MCG and RTA


[02-Jan-22 12:10 PM] dasefx1#0000
left


[02-Jan-22 12:11 PM] dasefx1#0000
RTA I will contribute tomorrow


[02-Jan-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is a smart move to get an early start on this new manufacturing planet.


[02-Jan-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think swinging the vote on Nike is a tricky political situation. I dont know that we have enough bases to guarantee a governorship yet


[02-Jan-22 12:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We are close though, and with an HQ built it will be more convincing.


[02-Jan-22 12:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
true


[02-Jan-22 12:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also people would be upset that the taxes get distributed among OOG shareholders even though that is the goal 🤣

🏗️ 👍 

[02-Jan-22 12:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
for corp HQ


[02-Jan-22 12:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
If we do smart we can help nike grow, plus take some money out 😄


[02-Jan-22 12:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
exactly! but we need a smooth operator to convince the masses that its not a scam


[02-Jan-22 12:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
how many members we had on nike ?


[02-Jan-22 12:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
plus I will convice Kapusta to vote for us, as he had base there


[02-Jan-22 12:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
6 on Nike, possibly 1 more base incoming


[02-Jan-22 12:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
we don't have any good opposition, as AHI only have kapusta on nike


[02-Jan-22 12:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ANTs + Rain on Nike


[02-Jan-22 12:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
other members from what I know, are govern on other planets


[02-Jan-22 12:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
could be 5-6 votes against + propaganda campaign


[02-Jan-22 12:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
so only few competitors


[02-Jan-22 12:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is close though. with HQ and a few more bases it would be an easy win.


[02-Jan-22 12:17 PM] dasefx1#0000
80% that we wil lwin


[02-Jan-22 12:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we could build a planet infrastructure project in first or second term.


[02-Jan-22 12:19 PM] dasefx1#0000
around 22 players on nike

Governor on Nike also means reducing the Warehouse cost 😄


[02-Jan-22 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
exactly!


[02-Jan-22 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 rushing Nike in this manner would delay your plan to build up on Antares I C


[02-Jan-22 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
well, you are already on Nike so I suppose it does not delay you from getting the base, but it will delay other smaller players who will be deciding between Nike or this new manufacturing planet.


[02-Jan-22 01:43 PM] dasefx1#0000
don't worry 🙂 slowly we will do it 😄


[02-Jan-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can make Antares 1 C my 4th base.


[02-Jan-22 01:44 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had HQ9 to do before Antares C 🙂 so 75 LBH and 54 LSE LDE 😛 so it will take time


[02-Jan-22 01:44 PM] dasefx1#0000
I plan to do COGC on anatares II g, HQ8 for gazprom, HQ8 for nutrien, plus bases 😄


[02-Jan-22 01:44 PM] dasefx1#0000
so a lot of 😄


[02-Jan-22 01:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, high price for building giant bases with 1000 area


[02-Jan-22 01:45 PM] dasefx1#0000
true 🙂 but worth time 🙂 I don't like to fly too much


[02-Jan-22 01:48 PM] dasefx1#0000
I checked today Drones production, and I think we need CU, AU, LIO and N planet before we start it 🙂


[02-Jan-22 01:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
How much Lithium is needed per drone?


[02-Jan-22 01:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
13.5 LIO


[02-Jan-22 01:50 PM] dasefx1#0000
per one DRS making 1.07 RED daily


[02-Jan-22 01:50 PM] dasefx1#0000
so if we want to have 4-5 DRS in corp


[02-Jan-22 01:50 PM] dasefx1#0000
than amount is high


[02-Jan-22 01:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That is about 7 extractor*day on KI-401b


[02-Jan-22 01:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
to get 14 LIO


[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
very bad concentration, but I already have extractors here if that is needed to get an early start


[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
pointless


[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
SE-648a or KI-439b

{Reactions}
🎯 

[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there is CUO and AUO on a single planet nearby if I remember right. edit: nope..


[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
SE-648a is best for LIO as only INS


[02-Jan-22 01:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
needed


[02-Jan-22 01:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
and 4 jumps


[02-Jan-22 01:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
however most extractors are on KI-439b


[02-Jan-22 01:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
6 jumps


[02-Jan-22 01:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
CUO is KI-840c, dominicus should do base there


[02-Jan-22 01:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
but we will need a lot of CUO


[02-Jan-22 01:54 PM] dasefx1#0000
around 4 CU needed per one drone


[02-Jan-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
QJ-650c for gold, then?


[02-Jan-22 01:55 PM] dasefx1#0000
yes


[02-Jan-22 01:55 PM] dasefx1#0000
gold can be last


[02-Jan-22 01:55 PM] dasefx1#0000
as AUO  I bought a lot from CX


[02-Jan-22 01:55 PM] dasefx1#0000
as someone fill all orders


[02-Jan-22 01:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
drones assembled on Phobos or Antares 1 C?


[02-Jan-22 01:56 PM] dasefx1#0000
SCA can be on anatares C


[02-Jan-22 01:56 PM] dasefx1#0000
but rest should be on phobos


[02-Jan-22 01:57 PM] dasefx1#0000
when I move all 8 PPF and SCA to anares C I will have space maybe for 1 drone


[02-Jan-22 01:57 PM] dasefx1#0000
simple RED drone line can make 45k daily profit from my calculation


[02-Jan-22 01:57 PM] dasefx1#0000
only 1mln investment

{Reactions}
🤑 (2) 

[02-Jan-22 01:59 PM] dasefx1#0000
1 DRS    operating 100%will need 
1 SCA 57% needed
1ELP 100% needed
1 ECA 23% needed
1 FS 42% needed 
1 CLR 100% needed
plus PPF, and 1-2 SME


[02-Jan-22 02:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
and N planet or source is needed as 14 N daily is consumption of SCA working on 57%


[02-Jan-22 02:01 PM] dasefx1#0000
with time, if we have few DRS in corp, we will have a lot of money 😄


[02-Jan-22 02:01 PM] dasefx1#0000
this line is for simple RED drone


[02-Jan-22 02:01 PM] dasefx1#0000
if more expensive probably we need more investment 🙂

Gazprom will set up LI production planet KI-439b in 1-2 weeks 🙂


[08-Jan-22 02:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is great!


[08-Jan-22 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 12 LI on Phobos if that is needed in the short term, I mainly refined it for fun on KI-401b, but cannot produce more of it really.


[08-Jan-22 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

will you produce capacitor banks?


[15-Jan-22 02:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
Maybe in long term, in short term only POW


[16-Jan-22 01:57 PM] dasefx1#0000

[16-Jan-22 01:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The gas planet?


[16-Jan-22 01:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
impressive. Im beginning to think I should get a hydrogen base instead of manufacturing on A1C


[16-Jan-22 02:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
yes H planet


[16-Jan-22 02:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
all area used 🙂

it will be nice to have you next to me 🙂


[16-Jan-22 02:02 PM] dasefx1#0000
because Mad is quiting, H price will go up 🙂 so market should be more profitable than now


[16-Jan-22 02:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i need H for polymer plants


[16-Jan-22 02:03 PM] spatial_piano#0000
That's a good point actually


[16-Jan-22 02:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
at least 2000 H I sold to market maker on CX


[16-Jan-22 02:03 PM] dasefx1#0000
as Mad put 3k for 55, so pointless to fight 😛


[16-Jan-22 02:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
now price should be 70 I hope 🙂


[20-Jan-22 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Will someone help me figure out a decent but steepish market price for HOP? I struggle setting prices on items that have not been sold yet on the CX


[20-Jan-22 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
assuming no-on in corp wants them


[20-Jan-22 04:10 PM] insensless72#0000
Recipe calls for 2 DDT and 60 H2O for 15 with 47hrs production time


[20-Jan-22 04:11 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's 700 on Hortus, so I think you might get away with 1k/u I think.

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Jan-22 04:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Althouhgh it seems that the last price it sold at on Hortus was 500.


[20-Jan-22 04:15 PM] insensless72#0000
1 is all thats required for a recipe of ALE


[20-Jan-22 04:16 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. it's good to think what is a price people would pay for ale and then think what an ALE producer would pay for the hops


[20-Jan-22 04:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ALE ask is at 700 so the recipe produces 4200. 1k would be quarter of that, but I think they would pay it.


[20-Jan-22 04:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Other items in the recipe are cheap and there is not much labor


[20-Jan-22 04:19 PM] insensless72#0000
Thank you!

[23-Jan-22 03:22 PM] domicius#0000
Do people invest in simple 1 resource worlds much?


[23-Jan-22 03:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Depends on the world and the resource. ZV-307a is high concentration GAL in the same system as the CX.


[23-Jan-22 03:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Since is very hot you need TSH, but with high concentration you can get a lot out of just a couple of buildings.


[23-Jan-22 03:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's definitely not for goiung vertical though


[23-Jan-22 03:25 PM] domicius#0000
Gotcha. Thanks for explaining.


[23-Jan-22 05:46 PM] namthorn#0000
Cheaper SF would be nice, I could justify a lot more journeys if the price came down to where it was a month or 2 ago.


[23-Jan-22 06:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
In my opinion he had SF ship thats why it is good for him 😁

no, if it fully degrades, it will hit a minimum speed. ship condition is like a multiplier for flight speed

@dasefx1 are you running any software buildings? I am realizing I could build these on Phobos instead of adding a 4th base.

talking about strategy...
I have completed my base on Harmonia, after next POPR, I'll reach area limit and start producing some serious amounts of RAT/DW
what would we need next?
I was thinking to go to Nike, since it's our HQ, but from what I hear you guys already produce more LST than market can soak and situation with bfabs is similar (?)
So maybe rather start some chemistry base somewhere?

what do you think?


[30-Jan-22 12:47 PM] kharadan#0000
I have no idea how it looks with advanced materials, precisely for the reason that they are usually traded internally, maybe some of that would also make sense


[30-Jan-22 12:48 PM] dasefx1#0000
Nike is good for construction as COGC 🙂 but if chemistry best is griffisone


[30-Jan-22 12:49 PM] kharadan#0000
do you still see room on construction market?
won't we flood it too much?


[30-Jan-22 12:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
if you want expand fast, best is to have own fabs 😄


[30-Jan-22 12:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
as I played long, and CX prices are not stable at all 🙂


[30-Jan-22 12:49 PM] kharadan#0000
makes sense, so point for Nike


[30-Jan-22 12:50 PM] kharadan#0000
and a stupid question about Griffonstone, besides CoGC, why is it such a goof chemistry planet?


[30-Jan-22 12:50 PM] kharadan#0000
MGS gains don't look that good there


[30-Jan-22 12:50 PM] dasefx1#0000
HAL for CL than for EPO


[30-Jan-22 12:50 PM] dasefx1#0000
like BSE production cost on nike I had around 420, so much cheaper to use own fabs than CX or corp 😛


[30-Jan-22 12:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
or CL for TCL or DDT


[30-Jan-22 12:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
with laboratory


[30-Jan-22 12:51 PM] dasefx1#0000
I majorly produce EPO + one lab doing DDT


[30-Jan-22 12:52 PM] dasefx1#0000
HAL excess I bring to nutrien on phobos and he do majorly chemistry and he make CL than TCL


[30-Jan-22 12:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
my advice always is same first fabs, than dw+rat, than chemistry


[30-Jan-22 12:53 PM] kharadan#0000
sounds reasonable, so I'll join you on Nike next


[30-Jan-22 12:54 PM] kharadan#0000

I dont have a good spot to run them currently but i would happily build them on any OOG base


[03-Feb-22 11:53 AM] insensless72#0000
I'll gladly help bankroll, I'm maxed as far as shipping potential so I can't be the one that builds it. We could bankroll a 2nd or 3rd base for someone on Deimos, Phobos, or Harmonia


[03-Feb-22 01:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@here anyone interested in burning plants on a large scale?


[03-Feb-22 02:24 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'll throw my hat in. I was looking to expand to join you guys on Deimos anyway (currently only a small Phobos base, so I wanted to expand/move HQ before getting too big). I just became a supporter of the game so I'm PRO committed for at least the next 6 months. I would be happy to manage a carbon base and even track bankrolls to supply C at straight cost until breaking even! My one requirement is that I get some of the base space for other things (obviously not bankrolled) as well? Or do you guys want the full base space dedicated to C production?


[03-Feb-22 02:29 PM] namthorn#0000
yes...join us in the ALO mines


[03-Feb-22 02:31 PM] artokun#0000
if you come in I can sell my FRM and INC and buy from you and focus more on SME


[03-Feb-22 02:31 PM] artokun#0000
but, it's gonna be a while before you are totally ramped up!


[03-Feb-22 02:34 PM] namthorn#0000
sell the FRM as-is imo, the soil on deimos is a bit rubbish


[03-Feb-22 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday your base is your base, we could work out some debt structure where you ultimately get fabs up front and pay back with some mixture of carbon/cash. At the end of it you have 100% ownership


[03-Feb-22 02:34 PM] namthorn#0000
you'd prob net more by just importing the agri

{Reactions}
👍 🤔 

[03-Feb-22 02:35 PM] namthorn#0000
esp with that shiny new harmonia base


[03-Feb-22 02:35 PM] namthorn#0000
on-topic though, I'd be willing to help set up a carbon supplier locally


[03-Feb-22 02:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, we probably cant max a new base right away without concerted effort. As artokun said, some ramp up period is expected


[03-Feb-22 02:36 PM] namthorn#0000
I can provide some cash and pp2 time for fabs


[03-Feb-22 02:56 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'll also make as much bfabs as I can before starting the base. If given a week I could prob get some bfabs together. I'll aim for next Friday to fly a ship out with bfabs to create the base. Anyone who is helping out - let me know what you're making and where to pick it up so I can coordinate accordingly!


[03-Feb-22 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you are shopping in corp, you will get the best prices from buying BFAB, LFAB and TRU on Nike. Buy MCG and PSL on Phobos.


[03-Feb-22 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or Deimos, possibly 🙂


[03-Feb-22 02:58 PM] kharadan#0000
or you can get MCG directly on Deimos if that's where you're settling 🙂


[03-Feb-22 03:02 PM] namthorn#0000
can provide BBH & BSE on Deimos at corp rates, got 10 BBH 14 BSE in stock atm and make a combination of 8 of those daily

[03-Feb-22 09:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Very convenient to have this construction capacity on Deimos @namthorn . Thanks for volunteering.


[03-Feb-22 09:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday as you can see there are some options. One thing you will have trouble getting off of Phobos is PSL. I recommend talking to @spatial_piano for this, before you start flying about to Deimos and/or Nike.


[04-Feb-22 08:20 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Thanks for the heads up, I didn't realize I had to build the Core module for the 2nd base. @spatial_piano  do you have any on Deimos I could grab?


[04-Feb-22 08:22 AM] yjhasaday#0000
That means I'm probably a bit further away than a week from getting this base up and running 😦 that's a lot of lfabs that are needed for the Core Module


[04-Feb-22 10:34 AM] namthorn#0000
yea the CM is the tricky part 😛 I can provide LTAs for it on Deimos as well but LSE/LDE i dont have nor the mats for them locally.


[04-Feb-22 10:44 AM] dasefx1#0000
for BDE and BSE please came to me 🙂


[04-Feb-22 04:13 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@yjhasaday I have PSL on Phobos and on CX. I don't have a base on Deimos, so I don't really make stops there. I could drop in if I can get enough AL to fill a ship, .


[04-Feb-22 04:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Price is 12@15300


[04-Feb-22 04:16 PM] namthorn#0000
i think those of us on deimos can arrange a full AL load np


[04-Feb-22 04:21 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Actually since Havaday has a base on Phobos, it's easier to just trade there. I could make a drop on Deimos regardless if there is ask for cheap MCG.


[04-Feb-22 04:21 PM] rune_242#0000
Yes


[04-Feb-22 04:22 PM] rune_242#0000
I would love some🙃


[04-Feb-22 05:07 PM] yjhasaday#0000
@spatial_piano Okay, sounds good! I can pick up on Phobos, my ship will be leaving from here when I'm ready anyway. I'll let you know when that is - this is a much larger undertaking than I originally anticipated so I'll probably need 2+ weeks to prepare. I'll keep you guys posted. I thought I could just hit start base and start building HB1's 😆  But those CM's are a lot, I'm just a man with 4 buildings right now lol


[04-Feb-22 05:08 PM] yjhasaday#0000
In fact if you guys need C faster than I can mobilize I wouldn't be offended if someone else wanted to take on the C expansion base


[04-Feb-22 05:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
@yjhasaday i can borrow 150k to support expansion for 20-30 days


[04-Feb-22 05:40 PM] yjhasaday#0000
That's very nice of you, I would have to pay it back within 20-30 days? Can I pay it in free Carbon to you once I get my INC's setup?


[04-Feb-22 05:41 PM] dasefx1#0000
Of course, no difference


[04-Feb-22 05:42 PM] dasefx1#0000
When you want list like 1dw for 150k and let me know


[04-Feb-22 05:43 PM] dasefx1#0000
And  bse and bde needed  I can do same


[04-Feb-22 05:46 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, thanks! I'm just finishing up stabilizing my first base then my focus will shift to 2nd base. I'll reach out to you when I'm ready. Cheers!


[04-Feb-22 05:48 PM] dasefx1#0000

I don't know if he would like to join or no 🙂 but good to have him in corp, he is involved in a lot of ANT programms 🙂 now together we are building 3 UNI on phobos 😄

[05-Feb-22 10:35 AM] insensless72#0000
@everyone We are changing our Corporate policy slightly as to how we handle new members. @dasefx1 (This has nothing to do with your invitation to Rain an does not apply.) We will begin inviting players to the Discord for a short period BEFORE we invite them to the Corp in game. We are doing this for several reasons: 1) It allows newer players to test out the corporation and see if they like it before fully committing. 2) It shields the corporation from players who would join and leech off our tax revenue on Nike.

[05-Feb-22 10:38 AM] insensless72#0000
I say this because I am in the process of recruiting a farmer from Harmonia to the corporation and did not want anyone to invite them to the corporation in game. I can kick/ban players from Discord. however, once they are in the corporation in game we have no defensive alternatives.


[05-Feb-22 10:41 AM] kharadan#0000
makes sense 👍 
btw. how does the tax revenue work?
I didn't notice that I would get any, I don't think I should get any, just curious how it works...

@kharadan in this case we should have dedicated corp, but governor will lose corp hq bonus

[05-Feb-22 10:47 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

How close are we to building FLT ships in corp? I know we have the capability to build STL ships I am just unaware of the missing pieces of FTL


[11-Feb-22 06:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is definitely one for @dasefx1


[11-Feb-22 06:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
FTL I think is far away. Basic ship need few WAI, so a lot of time needed. Now  on phobos I had only 30 /110 eng needed, so I didnt consider scnientisc yet


[11-Feb-22 07:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 so what I am hearing is, we need to get a scientist and software labs on your phobos base. It might be a good team effort to help you build the HBL (Luxury Residence)


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

about that I am not worrying. More difficult I think is to get source of consumables for it. As I only produce WS


[12-Feb-22 07:45 AM] dasefx1#0000
Nutrien is quiting prun, Still one base on phobos he had, but in few days, he should quit. I reorgranize with gazprom all my bases, and we reduce majorly construction side, and we focused on Electronics 😉


[12-Feb-22 07:46 AM] dasefx1#0000
so we end LST and BDE exporting :/ but it is good, as electronics is most profitable, and fabs are not liquid

@dasefx1 hypothetically if you had software lab with scientists, you would need a good supply of ROM units. Other than the blue gold, this one is pretty basic materials to make it.


[12-Feb-22 11:00 AM] dasefx1#0000
yes, but ROM is easy to produce and my 2 SCA produce more than I need

true, but like SAR production cost is around 9k, and on cx I see it for 22k 🙂


[13-Feb-22 07:12 AM] allocater#0000
then it's even more profit than 20k per day if you do SAR yourself 🤩


[13-Feb-22 07:43 AM] allocater#0000
since we go into electronics anyway, we could even supply some of the lower level inputs and increase profit further

Is SAR something we can produce? I would buy it for 15k.


[14-Feb-22 04:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
we can, only I am short of them, as I use them also for STL ships


[14-Feb-22 04:58 AM] namthorn#0000
ye it's less of a question of if they can be made and more a question of if there is surplus production, i'd assume most with an ELP have a vertical chain of their own to feed with ELP parts.


[14-Feb-22 05:01 AM] dasefx1#0000
SAR I used for STL ships, BSC and than drones. Sometimes to make ADR if I had REA. Problem with SAR is that it consume a lot of SEN and PCB, which are not easy to make. like SEN need 10 H 10 N and 10 TRN


[14-Feb-22 05:02 AM] namthorn#0000

@deleted-role Sunday strategy update time!


[20-Feb-22 12:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hello OOG shareholders,

I am here to provide a strategy update for the corporation, but first, we should look back on our accomplishments!

We have met all of our major strategic goals so far on accelerated timelines, AND we have added new members at every step of the way! I have seen the level of activity and base-building accelerate over the past 6 months and I am quite proud of how we have grown and developed.

Our latest accomplishment is to bring on additional farming, food production, and carbon players who rapidly expanded to Harmonia. This has stabilized our supply chain and provided extra headroom for us to expand as a whole. Thank you, and congrats to everyone who took risk on a rapid expansion and to those who helped finance the operations.


[20-Feb-22 12:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Now, the news!

As some of you may have picked up, our largest/oldest OOG members are collaborating to build an FTL ship using mostly OOG-sourced components. Kapusta from AHI corp has joined us on this job to help cover some of the production and planning along with yaro.

This first ship will likely be sold to the highest bidder to float our operations and pay the collaborators fairly, but in the process of building it, we will do our best to duplicate many components so that we can more readily build the next ship for OOG.

Shipbuilding is very difficult and time-sensitive. It requires a huge range of items, from bulk metal components, full electronics suites including engineer-only and scientist-only production, advanced chemistry, and sourcing of rare materials.

Unfortunately this does not leave much room for help or collaboration on the first ships. At this stage, we are pursuing this as wealthy players who are willing to put up a few million collectively to build the infrastructure.

For those who want to collaborate and get involved ASAP in shipbuilding, please stay tuned to our discussions here and consider possibilities for supplying metals or low-tech production items which feed into the higher tech systems.


[20-Feb-22 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am happy to answer any questions, and will keep you all posted on these exciting developments.

Does anyone have RSE /RTA? I can't build by CLR until I get some :(


[24-Feb-22 09:23 AM] dasefx1#0000
I am short with both of them. But I can borrow 2 RSE and 4 RTA for HBC.  But I think better is to set up HB3 and HB2 seperate.

Hi guys - how can I expand my base size? Ive already run out on Phobos :(


[28-Feb-22 04:01 AM] kharadan#0000
You can add a base permit on base screen. It will add 250 area and count as another base towards base limit


[28-Feb-22 04:02 AM] namthorn#0000
worth pointing out you get 500 space for using the permit on another planet so if there's another industry you want to get into or another LM to access it could be worth starting a base somewhere else rather than just adding 250 to your existing base.


[28-Feb-22 04:57 AM] domicius#0000
Hmm good points.


[28-Feb-22 04:58 AM] domicius#0000
Either way, need to increase my HQ level


[28-Feb-22 09:17 AM] namthorn#0000
anyone in the FIM market? I keep seeing murmurings that demand's increasing but I don't really see it on the local CX.

hmm, so what you're saying is there's potentially a market there? I was thinking about dabbling in HER farming as a sink for any excess DDT anyway. Thanks for that.


[28-Feb-22 03:07 PM] insensless72#0000
I'm up to 300 FIM now @namthorn it's still a little early for FIM to be in high demand


[28-Feb-22 03:08 PM] spatial_piano#0000
What's the cost of FIM in corp? I'll start needing some in a week or two.


[28-Feb-22 03:09 PM] insensless72#0000
I have mine set at 800ea


[28-Feb-22 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 It would be nice to have a bulk delivery to Phobos for these, so you could sell to those of us who have engineers now


[28-Feb-22 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also need them now that I have the AMLs


[28-Feb-22 03:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they could come alongside the ALE, WIN, etc.


[28-Feb-22 03:15 PM] insensless72#0000
Does anyone ever fly Harmonia > Phobos? I could send all that I have there and keep them in the WAR


[28-Feb-22 03:22 PM] namthorn#0000
some might but you'd have more luck going Harmonia -> CX -> Phobos if no one here is flying that route imo.


[28-Feb-22 03:24 PM] insensless72#0000
Youre probably right

how is AL now cheaper on Benton. We are supposed to be the AL region!


[03-Mar-22 03:06 AM] namthorn#0000
price of both C and FLX on the CX are a lot higher than normal


[03-Mar-22 03:07 AM] namthorn#0000
and most AL stock got bought out last week


[03-Mar-22 03:08 AM] namthorn#0000
can sell for much cheaper than CX if you get it direct from deimos though


[03-Mar-22 06:01 AM] allocater#0000
I don't actually need AL, it's just a "cultural" thing 😄


[03-Mar-22 06:33 AM] namthorn#0000
fair enough


[03-Mar-22 06:34 AM] namthorn#0000
ALO has also risen a little too, so yea if all the inputs go up, outputs will naturally follow

maybe the steam release will get more players


[05-Mar-22 12:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hi @everyone Just a quick update on the state of OOG and the game in general. It seems like a big chunk of the original player base is falling off, and something of a galaxy wide recession is setting in.


[05-Mar-22 12:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also the wealthy players who do remain have turned inwards to some extent, focusing on their own ship building and less on open trade


[05-Mar-22 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Not to worry, though. Many of us plan to play until the devs reset the game universe, and OOG will remain more or less like it is now.


[05-Mar-22 12:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In the mean time, I think it would benefit us to begin thinking of ways to prepare ourselves for loss of external suppliers, and possibly consider downsizing in some cases.


[05-Mar-22 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Suggestions, concerns, general observations etc. are welcome as always 🙂

@deleted-role I would like to discuss with you all about developing 1 or 2 electronics bases in corporation.

 The reason for this announcement/request is to replace @dasefx1 's advanced vertical electronics production lines which he has been reducing to software only (For WAI production)


[17-Mar-22 11:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
A good entry point, and necessary foundation to feed into more advanced parts is to build SME, FS, CLR and SCA. MCA and ECA are possible next steps depending on what metals you can easily source. These are a combination of metallurgy, manufacturing and electronics buildings.


[18-Mar-22 07:03 AM] namthorn#0000
I'm in the process of setting up LI production which could feed into ECAs and was planning to get CU/BCO production going after that if that helps.


[18-Mar-22 07:03 AM] namthorn#0000
main issue with the metallurgy side of things is that the FS runs so fast and the inputs are quite heavy


[18-Mar-22 01:46 PM] allocater#0000
I am building an electronics arm on phobos, but from behind, starting with ELP and then maybe going down to SCA and CLR. Since SEN and PCB are available for fair prices (so far)


[18-Mar-22 02:16 PM] cazertanu#0000
Will you need FE to do that? I am debating building an iron smelting operation on phobos soon or demios weeks later.


[18-Mar-22 02:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater These buildings I mentioned above are the ones that @dasefx1  recommended to begin developing ship building capacity.


[18-Mar-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
From this foundation, the idea is to pass the intermediate electronics products to APF and AAF buildings


[18-Mar-22 02:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@cazertanu this would work for like 2-3 smelters but you would have difficulty with scaling beyond that


[18-Mar-22 02:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this could still be useful on phobos for electronics despite that. You also have the ability to make steel and silicon


[18-Mar-22 02:49 PM] allocater#0000
right, I am definitely open to expand phobos with CLR and I have already been thinking about a SCA base on ANTc. So if someone has the SME+FS on deimos, there could be good synergy.

@allocater I have 7 SME and 1 FS on Deimos


[18-Mar-22 05:35 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets create some synergy


[18-Mar-22 05:48 PM] allocater#0000
I can fit 3 CLR on phobos atm (8 if I refit or expand). A new SCA base will require more time, including HQ upgrade.


[18-Mar-22 05:50 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ihave 1 CLR running, supported by 1 SME on phobos. As I move more Manuf. to ANTIC I'll have more space, but I'm currently pretty full.


[18-Mar-22 05:52 PM] insensless72#0000
I think the biggest limit here would be the SME time. idk if i could fuel your 3 CLR and SCA while maintaining my own demand, though I could certainly try. For the CL you would mainly need SI and AL correct?


[18-Mar-22 05:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah.. For some items you need Fe, GAL or C, but you can run it on just AL and SI


[18-Mar-22 05:54 PM] allocater#0000
correct


[18-Mar-22 05:54 PM] allocater#0000
I can start with 1 CLR


[18-Mar-22 05:54 PM] allocater#0000
we ramp up as it fits


[18-Mar-22 05:56 PM] insensless72#0000
Also another thing to think about, which @spatial_piano was smart about, you might want your own SME on Phobos for the SI production. I have no local SIO so it would have to fly from Phobos to Deimos and then back to Phobos


[18-Mar-22 05:56 PM] insensless72#0000
If you set uo 1 SME for SI I could help supply both of you with the AL if i ramp up production


[18-Mar-22 06:01 PM] allocater#0000
makes sense


[18-Mar-22 06:02 PM] allocater#0000
I will also probe the local market for SI. It should be cheap locally.


[18-Mar-22 06:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I mostly did it because it was faster then setting up a new base on Deimos. It's more efficient to process on Deimos, and you still need to get the ALO or AL in from somewhere regardless, so I think it's still better to smelt on Deimos if you can. Phobos isn't bad tho, and it's pretty easy. I also have a CHP here so I can make all the FLX I need


[18-Mar-22 06:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
recently i sold 100 SI to rain at 800 each. I could sell as low as 500 in corp

[19-Mar-22 01:00 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Oh, I have 3 REF on Nike and 1 on Phobos. I generally take some fuel with me to Deimos now when I make runs as well. It's a good industry for profit margins (especially right now with prices being very high) but it takes a lot to keep the REFs running. I burn through a lot of H and NAB/GAL/HE3 which are hard to source here in Antares space. GAL is very heavy too so it seems I'm constantly making runs to resupply lol


[19-Mar-22 01:02 PM] yang_mills#0000
I was discussing today on UFO on the need of a planet in Antares region specialized in refining, that is to say with a COGC giving the corresponding bonus.


[19-Mar-22 01:03 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, the closest fuel COGC is like Cortez which is like 10(?) jumps away lol. That's why I do it on Nike because the corp HQ bonus is there - better than nothing! lol


[19-Mar-22 01:30 PM] namthorn#0000
if shipping mats for processing is your current bottleneck a CoGC will exacerbate your issue


[19-Mar-22 01:30 PM] namthorn#0000
better served setting up on somewhere with some of the mats as local resources imo


[19-Mar-22 01:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
Like refining on a planet with AMM?


[19-Mar-22 01:33 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, depending on what the bottleneck is, i.e. if you're making SF setting up on electronica for BOR -> NAB processing


[19-Mar-22 01:33 PM] namthorn#0000
cuts out that part of the logistics from your chain allowing you to build more refs


[19-Mar-22 01:34 PM] namthorn#0000
wheras adding an extra 25% efficiency boost will just mean you're going back and forth resupplying more often


[19-Mar-22 01:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
Where does  @MarkyMarkAurelius | MRKF refine? I know that he settled a planet with GAL and an other one with AMM+H.


[19-Mar-22 01:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I don't have a planet with GAL yet. I refine on Phobos and produce AMM and H on QJ-382g.


[19-Mar-22 01:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I use NAB to produce


[19-Mar-22 01:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
I see.


[19-Mar-22 01:38 PM] namthorn#0000
there's potentially a full chain in the ANT system, but requires settling ANT 1a for GAL & 1g for H


[19-Mar-22 01:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
Invictus | IG considers turning QJ-684b into a refining planet. I think he can also supply AMM and NAB in bulk.


[19-Mar-22 01:45 PM] namthorn#0000
im guessing thats just because its a relatively easy settle 1 jump from the CX?


[19-Mar-22 02:21 PM] yang_mills#0000
QJ-684b is also a rocky planet with SEA the only special requirement for building.

Anyone know of a reliable place to find AU?


[24-Mar-22 10:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 QJ-650c is the nearest gold planet with a LM + WAR


[25-Mar-22 03:55 AM] allocater#0000
AUO is constantly thrown away to the MM at 137 so you can just scoop it up


[25-Mar-22 02:41 PM] namthorn#0000
do you have enough AMM for a shipload currently? Realised i can make the trip sooner than expected.


[25-Mar-22 02:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah I have 4 full shiploads


[25-Mar-22 03:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@namthorn We can make a deal now if you are available


[25-Mar-22 03:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000

@insensless72 did you see this? start with MM +1 penny buys on ANT


[25-Mar-22 06:41 PM] insensless72#0000
I did, thank you @allocater for pointing that out, someone filled my order within 15mins


[26-Mar-22 02:56 AM] allocater#0000
yeah it was me with the previously scooped up gold 😄


[26-Mar-22 03:07 AM] allocater#0000
can we produce STL ships? I could use one for ANT1, especially if I build a SCA base on ANTc


[27-Mar-22 12:11 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yaro has made them in the past, they are not so hard to make if you have some metal and electronics capacity

This is the general STL blueprint, along with what I predict will be the most difficult items to produce


[27-Mar-22 12:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
aside from those 3, you are basically looking at metal and welding, which we have good capacity on Deimos.


[27-Mar-22 12:19 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater if you want to start building this blueprint, we can look at filling the metal materials.


[27-Mar-22 12:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 ^


[27-Mar-22 05:51 AM] allocater#0000
I will build UPF items myself, so we only need a GEN, worst case I buy it 140k from CX. So I think this is a go for the metal work.


[27-Mar-22 08:32 AM] insensless72#0000
I can swing the metallurgy


[27-Mar-22 08:42 AM] namthorn#0000
I can also help out w/ the GNZ/GEN if you want to build the GEN rather than buying. Got 4 GFs on Deimos.


[27-Mar-22 09:05 AM] allocater#0000
what inputs are you lacking for GEN? I can maybe collect them all and deliver to deimos


[27-Mar-22 09:34 AM] namthorn#0000
the LFPs and GVs I cant make, the rest I think I can with a little time, just have to import some PG & THF & MFK


[27-Mar-22 09:39 AM] namthorn#0000
if anyone has a couple hundred PG on deimos i could start the RG today.


[27-Mar-22 10:11 AM] allocater#0000
GV looks like something for metallurgy so should be available at deimos LM?

LFP I can CX buy for 16k


[28-Mar-22 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 Do you want to source some aluminum in corp for this? Also we have NFI on phobos for making SSC


[28-Mar-22 03:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if yes on the AL, lets move it to deimos chat

How established is your friend in Moria? Could be that they coliq or rip their buildings down and get established in Antares


[31-Mar-22 03:16 PM] insensless72#0000

@bitcoin_ape Were probably going to need to bump the price of LST down


[01-Apr-22 06:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can go extremely low


[01-Apr-22 06:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
idk about everyone else but i have been making decent money at 7k


[01-Apr-22 06:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Personally I am happy to go as low as we can all agree upon


[01-Apr-22 06:25 PM] insensless72#0000
6k = 32.8ea
5k = 27.3ea


[01-Apr-22 06:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
One extreme option is to go full anti-competition and monopolize everyone else out of LST


[01-Apr-22 06:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
dump BSE+MCG+SEA into corporate nike extractors and drive prices to around 20-25 per LST


[01-Apr-22 06:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but we pretty much do this already without trying so hard


[01-Apr-22 06:28 PM] insensless72#0000
im sitting on 3k now, so plenty to throw around


[01-Apr-22 06:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
check the corp spreadsheet for small extractor stacks on Nike. We need to at least evaluate much or how badly we would be boxing out OOG players before moving the price


[02-Apr-22 02:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
Question: What kind of materials are now the main bottleneck for the corp? What does it need/lack most? This is to plan my future expansion.


[02-Apr-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
good question. In the past I have had the answer to this, but times change quickly and I have been distracted with ships

it doesnt need to be me, but i have the new base stuff ready on phobos now


[02-Apr-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ehh, minus 12 PSL


[02-Apr-22 02:21 PM] yang_mills#0000
Why chlorine? Because of epoxy?


[02-Apr-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mainly epoxy, but also some other chemicals


[02-Apr-22 02:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
Epoxy is so need because of the PP3 prefabs, isn't it?


[02-Apr-22 02:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, large amounts of EPO are needed for RSE, and DEC


[02-Apr-22 02:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
CL is also needed for TCL to make KV, which is critical in PP3 and in shipbuilding


[02-Apr-22 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and DDT is needed for HER and ORC consumables


[02-Apr-22 02:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
EPO, KV, and DDT make chlorine kind of a bottleneck


[02-Apr-22 02:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
So Griffonstone is one of the most profitable planets over there?


[02-Apr-22 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is the best chemistry planet, and 2 jumps from Nike


[02-Apr-22 02:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
another thing i predict we need is hydrogen. this is more simple, but AEF can be difficult


[02-Apr-22 02:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yaro had a H base on Antares IIg, near Deimos


[02-Apr-22 02:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but it is gone now, and so is the corp H supply


[02-Apr-22 03:09 PM] namthorn#0000
can confirm, big moolah, and also no special building mats required - that's a big deal for the number of buildings you can throw down in a HAL chain.


[02-Apr-22 05:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
Hydrogen can be extracted on QJ-382g. @spatial_piano  has a base there.


[02-Apr-22 05:31 PM] erklein#0000
I think eventually, I want to set up a base for LI or CU production. Is that going to be something in demand or anyone got any tips for good planets for those?


[02-Apr-22 05:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
For CUO you have KI-840c


[02-Apr-22 05:33 PM] yang_mills#0000
Not too far away and requires only SEA.


[02-Apr-22 05:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
From a transportation perspective, it is more efficient to ship CUO rather than CU.


[02-Apr-22 05:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
So you can import CUO from KI-840c and produce CU on Deimos.


[02-Apr-22 05:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
One can buy a full cargo of CUO on the LM on KI-840c.


[02-Apr-22 05:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
Or you can produce CU on KI-840c, and also there, out of CU manufacture BCO and SCN, which are very light.


[02-Apr-22 05:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
You will need then to ship O and SIO on KI-840c. Still better than shipping CUO.


[02-Apr-22 05:46 PM] namthorn#0000
Set up a LI base recently on KI-439b. Its costly but perfect for vertical LI production @erklein


[02-Apr-22 05:47 PM] namthorn#0000
Main issue with LI is the ore is heavy and you also need HAL, that planet has both and LI is so much easier to ship than LIO


[03-Apr-22 01:42 AM] allocater#0000
I am eyeing LI + BE now for all the ECA stuff, it seems even profitable to sell to MM, since there are a lot of sales.


[03-Apr-22 03:26 AM] allocater#0000
SE-648 is a perfect system for BE LI TC TI and could become an electronics hub

[03-Apr-22 04:40 AM] namthorn#0000
you'd need to import HAL still, as well as build up the region, those are all low temp planets with 648c requiring HSE too


[03-Apr-22 11:02 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
low temp + high pressure is not an easy combo. very expensive buildings


[03-Apr-22 02:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@yang_mills I Produce mostly AMM currently, and enough H for myself. I can up the H production if there is need for an in-corp source, but I don't think it's necessarily a good idea. H is cheap on KI-401D, and that is only 1 jump farther. the concentration is also a third higher there.


[03-Apr-22 02:06 PM] allocater#0000
I wonder what the dividend will be with phobos taxes 🤔


[03-Apr-22 02:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I would personally benefit most from in corp H  on QJ


[03-Apr-22 02:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Id prefer to buy from you, and everytime my ship is out in KI-401 I need to ship metal more than H


[03-Apr-22 02:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
plus we are building you an extraction cogc 😄


[03-Apr-22 02:25 PM] namthorn#0000
I'd fly out for a steady supply of H. Am using about 25/d so would gladly fly out once a month or so for a shipload


[03-Apr-22 02:27 PM] namthorn#0000
also ditto on the "would prefer to buy from you rather than randos"


[03-Apr-22 07:30 PM] cazertanu#0000
I have a small source of H and C on harmonia.  I use some for making PE but I do have some leftover at the end of the day.


[03-Apr-22 07:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Harmonia doesnt have enough H concentration. Its better to put collectors on a gas planet, you can extract much more with the same amount of pioneers and bfabs


[03-Apr-22 07:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For example, on QJ-382g, there is 13.3x higher Hydrogen concentration than Harmonia


[03-Apr-22 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with the chamber of commerce and assuming the same amount of resource experts on both planets, QJ would have 16.6x better Hydrogen extraction


[03-Apr-22 07:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on KI-401d the numbers are higher still, but we dont have any bases there


[03-Apr-22 08:24 PM] cazertanu#0000
true it would collect faster on QJ-382g, but i do want to sell H to corp mates. where will people use it?


[03-Apr-22 08:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Namthorn needs 25/day on Griffonstone and I need 50/day on Phobos


[04-Apr-22 08:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone With generous funding from the bank of @dasefx1 
I am happy to announce that OOG will be subsidizing Smelter work on Deimos at fixed prices, in order to support ASM and hull welding plants for ship production.


[04-Apr-22 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We will need 1 HWP running full time, with the necessary aluminum production behind it. Also, I predict we will need 3-4 SME running TI full time (TIO supplied free)


[04-Apr-22 08:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
```
OOG Deimos metal prices:

AL 300 AIC

this can be done with settlers only. Technicians not required.


[04-Apr-22 09:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this part is urgent, it is not too difficult to procure AL on deimos, but we need the hull plates in corp 🚀


[05-Apr-22 07:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have 4 SME on Deimos, producing AL. Have some AL to sell.


[05-Apr-22 07:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape, what kind of hull plates do you need? LHP or BHP? Because BHP also requires STL. Do you have HE in stock?


[05-Apr-22 07:29 AM] yang_mills#0000
I could build a HWP. I wanted to do it at some point in time anyway. But I don't have EXO and PT on Deimos. Nor HE. Nor light prefabs or truss.


[05-Apr-22 07:34 AM] yang_mills#0000
Also low on basic prefabs right now. What are the materials that you can provide on Deimos?


[05-Apr-22 10:02 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills We will start with LHP, but as STL and TI are accumulated I also plan to commission some BHP and RHP


[05-Apr-22 10:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
HE should be bought and imported by the shipload, I am willing to pay for that to get it running


[05-Apr-22 10:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
TRU and BFABs should be bought on Nike, I am willing to do 20-day deliver at these prices:

BSE = 600
BBH = 800
BDE = 800
BTA = 500

Of couse I will deliver BFABs up front and wait patiently for the payments


[05-Apr-22 10:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
EXO and PT for 40 settlers honestly are easy, I will give them to you for free if you come to Nike to get the rest of that 😄


[05-Apr-22 10:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
something like 10 EXO and 10 PT will keep them going for a month


[05-Apr-22 10:10 AM] namthorn#0000
ooh RHP? planning on settling some high ship damage planets?


[05-Apr-22 10:39 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I actually just upgraded my HQ and I'm thinking of putting up smelting on phobos.


[05-Apr-22 11:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
more like we have huge titanium capacity on the zirconium planet, so we might as well do fancy plates and charge extra


[05-Apr-22 11:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have a ship arriving on Nike in 5h. Can take Bfabs, Lfabs, TRU and consumables.


[05-Apr-22 12:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
do you need LFABs? My inventory is more limited for those. Request whatever BFAB, TRU, PT and EXO you need


[05-Apr-22 12:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
TRU = 250
PT = 275
EXO = 120

these are the prices i bought at


[05-Apr-22 12:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
20 days delivery is fine for everything. Pay at your convenience


[05-Apr-22 01:29 PM] yang_mills#0000
Posted ads for BSE, BBH, BDE, TRU and PT. Would also need 2 LTA. Do you have these?


[05-Apr-22 01:30 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also a question. What happens if I build an HWP but do not provide habitable space for technicians?


[05-Apr-22 01:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea I can do 2 LTA


[05-Apr-22 01:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you do that, you will simply have no technicians in your workforce


[05-Apr-22 01:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this will make the HWP run at decreased efficiency


[05-Apr-22 01:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
So less efficiency for HWP?

Is anybody making TSH? I'm trying to build on ZV-896a.


[07-Apr-22 08:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
I will start  respecialising my base on Phobos. I thought it would be a good idea to produce some electronics there. What kind of electronic materials does the corp need? I also plan to expand my metallurgy on Deimos and produce STL and CU on top of AL. Is this a good idea?


[07-Apr-22 08:38 AM] namthorn#0000
check out #ship-building for electronics needs


[07-Apr-22 08:39 AM] namthorn#0000
and STL is def doable on deimos, due to the FEO mine next door. As to if it's needed idk, STL market isn't particularly large but theres a couple in-corp that buy small amounts. Better off getting a shipload of TIO from KI-401b and smelting that down imo.


[07-Apr-22 08:41 AM] namthorn#0000
if you want to  go into STL/CU however then you'll need a good supply of O. I have a couple of O rigs on SE-648c that can provide tons at MM prices.

I think this is the fuel saving STL engine


[10-Apr-22 11:13 AM] insensless72#0000
Theyre in a corp with a few heavy hitters so it wouldnt surprise me


[10-Apr-22 11:16 AM] insensless72#0000
The more ships we pump out the more competition were going to stir up i would imagine


[12-Apr-22 02:23 PM] allocater#0000
since ship components are larger than 500t should we upgrade the Heph warehouse so that customers can rent 1000t?


[12-Apr-22 02:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
as long as individual items are below 500t it should be fine


[12-Apr-22 02:24 PM] allocater#0000
yeah but then we can never transfer the items in one go while the customer is offline


[12-Apr-22 02:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am in the process of upgrading the Nike WH to 1000t


[12-Apr-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats okay, I prefer to do these trades over discord with the person online. minimizes risk

[12-Apr-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the customer can also be skittish, once they transfer the money I assume they want all of the items quickly


[12-Apr-22 02:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the last guy was like that, he didnt have to wait very longg


[14-Apr-22 04:31 PM] allocater#0000
how can we prepare for the steam release and all the new players? stockpile b-fabs?


[14-Apr-22 04:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
Good idea.


[14-Apr-22 04:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Stockpile tons of bfabs, LST, consumables, and metals


[14-Apr-22 04:34 PM] insensless72#0000
C we need to keep cheap in corp because it spikes early


[14-Apr-22 04:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps we should stop selling LST at 6000 AIC on the LM.


[14-Apr-22 04:37 PM] insensless72#0000
We can bump it back up. When is the steam release?


[14-Apr-22 04:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
20th of April?


[14-Apr-22 04:40 PM] insensless72#0000
Plastics are also nice to have on hand when players surge


[14-Apr-22 04:53 PM] yang_mills#0000
We should inform the non-OOG members on Nike that we are going to raise the prices for LST.


[14-Apr-22 04:57 PM] insensless72#0000
Following steam release id be fine bumping it to 50per on Nike LM, I have LST moving at 94ea currently on CX


[14-Apr-22 04:58 PM] insensless72#0000
as long as corp is on board


[14-Apr-22 04:58 PM] yang_mills#0000
9000 for a full cargo hold?


[14-Apr-22 04:59 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes. When bfabs spike players will be able to float the increased cost of LST as an input

{Reactions}
👌 

[14-Apr-22 05:04 PM] insensless72#0000
and if it doesn't sell we bump it back down lol


[14-Apr-22 05:12 PM] namthorn#0000
BSE was 1500/u last i checked. I pity the newer folk if it spikes higher.


[14-Apr-22 11:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ive still got over 3k LST. We need to prepare advertisements for the new players


[14-Apr-22 11:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also many of them will be free, so no local market contracts... So shipping to ANT becomes the bottleneck


[15-Apr-22 08:04 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I might be able to step up efforts there. I routinely fly to Nike to pick up my fuel, I generally fill the other 2/3 of the ship with LST. I can start doing this more frequently but it means I won't be able to keep SF/FF as well stocked on Phobos and Deimos. Which would you guys prefer - more LST sales on Nike or fuel easily available for corp on Deimos/Phobos? Let me know and I can shift my ship's focus accordingly!


[15-Apr-22 08:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
I usually use one of my ships for shipping contracts from KI-401d. It pays well. However, if the corp needs more shipping from Nike to the CX, this ship can be employed for that instead. I would prefer @yjhasaday supplying more fuel, and I can do the shipping from Nike to the CX.


[15-Apr-22 08:16 AM] insensless72#0000
Between DLR and I alone we're sitting on 6k LST, not necessarily a bad thing with a player rush headed though. Would you prefer to flip the LST or just ship it?


[15-Apr-22 08:17 AM] insensless72#0000
Currently you would make more flipping it than shipping it


[15-Apr-22 08:23 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I flip it when I take some with my fuel. I figure its a win-win situation - you guys offload LST at a good price, I make some money flipping it, and our corp controls the LST market on ANT. Admittedly I haven't flipped some in a while though, because I have been making a lot of Bfabs and MCG on Phobos so I eat through a lot of it lol


[15-Apr-22 08:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
By flipping do you mean buying it cheaper on the LM and selling higher on the CX?


[15-Apr-22 08:31 AM] insensless72#0000
Yes, a buy offer instead of a shipping offer


[15-Apr-22 08:34 AM] yang_mills#0000
I can start doing that tomorrow.


[15-Apr-22 08:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
@insensless72 Picked one of your ads.


[15-Apr-22 08:44 AM] insensless72#0000
Just a quick post for everyone, if you need quick cash LST can help. Buying it in corp at 6 or 7k and selling it on market at 90 ea is a 10k gain. Way more lucrative than shipping. Thats when LST prices are high though


[16-Apr-22 02:13 AM] allocater#0000
do we still need to convert NCC into AIC? I will convert it 1:1, no fee


[16-Apr-22 06:55 AM] namthorn#0000
looks like someone's trying to establish a C monopoly on the CX


[16-Apr-22 07:00 AM] allocater#0000
also O and DW


[16-Apr-22 07:01 AM] allocater#0000

[16-Apr-22 07:13 AM] namthorn#0000
though it's kind of a terrible idea for the long-term. if there's nothing profitable for new people to do they will quit.


[16-Apr-22 08:06 AM] insensless72#0000
yeah but the newbies dont know theyre being screwed until the prices fall later on


[16-Apr-22 08:23 AM] namthorn#0000
idk about that, doesn't take a genius to add up the cost of their inputs vs what they are selling their outputs at and realize it's going nowhere. If I was playing solo and there was no change to the market sells of my inputs/outputs i'd likely demolish my smelters soon.


[16-Apr-22 08:24 AM] namthorn#0000
a new player aint gonna do that, they're just gonna stop.

[16-Apr-22 09:53 AM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps we should do that for LST. Could anyone post a large buy order at 80 AIC? I don't have the capital to do it myself.


[16-Apr-22 09:55 AM] yang_mills#0000
Or we could split the efforts among corp members, each posting a smaller buy order.


[16-Apr-22 02:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BTW I bought ASEs as a short term solution to our PP4 issue that was discussed earlier in the #ship-building  channel


[17-Apr-22 05:22 AM] yang_mills#0000
That's where you see the benefits of vertical integration. Sea of Dirac is speculating on C, O and PE on the CX. But I don't care.


[17-Apr-22 05:31 AM] namthorn#0000
looks like they're attempting some sort of market takeover. it's a good thing we have people making C or I'd be very annoyed right now lol.


[17-Apr-22 06:09 AM] yang_mills#0000
It seems that their attempt for O failed.


[17-Apr-22 06:12 AM] namthorn#0000
kind of a hard market to corner lol, anyone on deimos using the stuff can just make a col and have tons and that's the primary industry for it


[17-Apr-22 06:12 AM] namthorn#0000
CU and STL smelting arent super commonplace either so demand was never particularly high.


[17-Apr-22 06:16 AM] yang_mills#0000
Invictus Galactic Holding speculating on MCG?


[17-Apr-22 06:18 AM] yang_mills#0000
Sea of Dirac also tried OVE but it didn't work.


[17-Apr-22 06:20 AM] yang_mills#0000
Also huge buys for DW and RAT recently. If it's again Sea of Dirac speculating, then it didn't quite work for these goods either.


[17-Apr-22 06:22 AM] yang_mills#0000
CX out of FE and STL.


[17-Apr-22 06:24 AM] yang_mills#0000
CX almost out of FEO.


[17-Apr-22 06:25 AM] namthorn#0000
might be worth setting up some bmps on nike, importing SIO and using the local LST supply to eat into the mcg market


[17-Apr-22 06:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have 1 BMP on Nike producing MCG 24h/24.


[17-Apr-22 06:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
But I have a large order for @rune_242 to fulfil.


[17-Apr-22 06:42 AM] yang_mills#0000
Sea of Dirac also speculates on SF. Huge buy recently. However, there is the MM sell order, so he can't go too high.


[17-Apr-22 06:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
I might set up a second BMP for the MCG.


[17-Apr-22 09:12 AM] insensless72#0000
BMP would also be useful for PE through PP1s


[17-Apr-22 10:04 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Can I just ask what all this PE is for? I have a few BMPs on Phobos but I took PE out of my rotation because I kept getting stuck with no buyers on it. I can bring it back into production if we need some more of it? I see @bitcoin_ape with more buy ads on Nike for a ton of it too!


[17-Apr-22 10:15 AM] allocater#0000
atm I am aiming for 3000 PE per day to keep the ECA somewhat running with HCC


[17-Apr-22 10:16 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, where is that? I make the PE on Phobos, I can build a couple more to start eating away at the demand faster


[17-Apr-22 10:16 AM] allocater#0000
ah perfect, it's on phobos


[17-Apr-22 10:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I use bulk PE for construction on Nike, BDE and INS mainly


[17-Apr-22 10:41 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
just FYI. Looks like you have a good arrangement with allocater here on phobos, ill find my own mountain of PE


[17-Apr-22 10:54 AM] yang_mills#0000
PE is used for producing BDE in PP1. Also used in some recipes in PP2. For now I produce my own PE. But I might need some extra supply from time to time. You could also sell PE on the CX. Because of Sea of Dirac's speculation, it is crazy expensive now, 10 AIC/u. One run of BMP produces 200 PE which you could sell at almost 2K AIC.

They rather work with Benten.


[17-Apr-22 12:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That may be, but LS-231 is equal distance from ANT and BEN

@everyone I plan to recruit out of the new player rush. Specifically we are looking for 1-2 dedicated carbon players, and optionally a vertical aluminum producer on deimos


[19-Apr-22 07:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Please keep an eye out on Deimos and Harmonia in-game planet chat, as i cant see these.


[19-Apr-22 07:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will be posting a message in the UFO recruitment discord


[19-Apr-22 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you are interested in recruiting, try something generic like “OOG is looking for dedicated carbon farmers, please inquire in direct messages if you want to learn more about our corporation”


[19-Apr-22 07:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On deimos, same thing, except “aluminum producer”


[20-Apr-22 08:49 AM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone Nirces (NIRC) can sell 40 C per day at 250 AIC/u on Harmonia LM. So contact him if you need carbon.


[21-Apr-22 05:36 AM] yang_mills#0000
I have new response on Deimos. But all this new players do not have PRO and cannot use the LM. So it's a bit pointless to recruit them. Perhaps we should make precise in the add that we need players with PRO.


[21-Apr-22 08:48 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think its possible they will get PRO after a week or two with corp - if they have enough interest in the game to be active on our Discord then they're prob willing to spend a few bucks to at least get basic. Is that not what the "probation"/Discord-only new recruit time is for? Also I've done some LM deals with some less-than-a-day-old accounts already so some are buying PRO right away


[21-Apr-22 09:11 AM] yang_mills#0000

Which other corps are building FTL ships atm?


[23-Apr-22 09:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
GTU - Galactic Trade Union. They have been a very large corp even in early game


[23-Apr-22 09:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the ANT* (ANTS, ANTH, etc.) people build shps internally


[23-Apr-22 09:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
FIO is probably the same way


[23-Apr-22 10:16 AM] namthorn#0000
requires a fair bit of organisation though, wonder if there's a way to scrape # of ships a company has


[23-Apr-22 10:54 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[23-Apr-22 10:55 AM] rune_242#0000
is there still need for AL expansion?


[23-Apr-22 10:55 AM] insensless72#0000
Always


[23-Apr-22 10:55 AM] insensless72#0000
Corp soaks it up and if we don the market will. if the market doesnt, fabs are always needed


[23-Apr-22 10:56 AM] rune_242#0000
and where is this all going to?


[23-Apr-22 10:56 AM] rune_242#0000
in the corp I mean


[23-Apr-22 10:57 AM] insensless72#0000
I burn around 30+ AL per day on Nike making b and l fabs alone. The rest goes into making AST


[23-Apr-22 10:58 AM] insensless72#0000
if you scale up into AL smelting it also allows you the ability to burn other ores like FE which goes into PP1s and alloys also


[23-Apr-22 11:00 AM] insensless72#0000
The real pull for AL comes from bfab production in PP2s. Since players are always expanding, joining, and repairing, theyre always in demand


[23-Apr-22 11:00 AM] rune_242#0000
hmmm I see


[23-Apr-22 11:01 AM] insensless72#0000
its also super easy since Deimos is the best AL planet in game


[23-Apr-22 11:14 AM] yang_mills#0000
I run a HWP on Deimos and 3 PP2 on Nike. I alone consume more than 55 AL a day. Sometimes it's more if I produce Lfabs instead of Bfabs. I also produce SI in SME from time to time, and this both consumes additional AL and lowers my AL output.


[23-Apr-22 11:15 AM] yang_mills#0000
If there is "too much AL" then I could just build additional PP2-s on Nike.


[23-Apr-22 11:16 AM] rune_242#0000
dammmmm


[23-Apr-22 11:16 AM] rune_242#0000

There is a new player, Mitlof (Deimos BTP - DBTP). His first and only base is on Nike. I can assume he produces prefabs there. He has PRO. He could be an interesting new recruit for our corp.


[23-Apr-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Today I bring up another PP2 on Nike. Yesterday I repaired all of them. Had to take down an EXT to make room, but it will be worth it

Interesting.. i didnt realize player could start on Nike


[23-Apr-22 11:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
I think he chose Deimos, hence the company name, but then moved to Nike instead.

im sure one of the LST miners can provide at better rates if you ask


[23-Apr-22 11:30 AM] insensless72#0000
Deimos BTP, and exploiting the player rush. Youre still more than welcome to get LST at corp rate, but like Namthorn said, those are for general market


[23-Apr-22 11:30 AM] insensless72#0000
10k per ship is still 55ea for them

@rune_242 If you need LST, I can sell it to you at 35 AIC per unit. Corp-member price. Otherwise, we all try to profit from the Bfab fever. Today I sold 160 LST on CX at 99 AIC/u.

There is a planet that went unnoticed so far. This is QJ-149c. 2 jumps away from ANT I. It does not have extra requirements for building and offers slightly more ALO than @Deimos . No oxygen though. It could be used as a second aluminium planet for those who don't have area left on @Deimos . One can put some EXT and plenty of SME there. A smart thing would be to add some PP2 producing only BBH (2 AL + 1LST). Else the production of AL is too high which would require to much shipping. With some PP2 part of the AL is consumed locally and on top of that the basic prefabs compress a lot the weight. One would then need to bring in LST. I made a base plan with the PRUNner tool. One can fill the planet with 4 EXT, 9 SME and 4 PP2. The profit per day with the current market prices is 30K AIC. One would have to ship in an average of 120 t per day (DW, RAT, OVE, PWO, EXO, PT, C, O, FLX and LST). One would have to ship out an average of 138 t per day (mainly AL, plus the BBH plus a tiny surplus of ALO). So weight in and weight out are almost balanced. With starting ships this would require a trip there every 4 days on average. But one would better have a ship with a larger cargo.


[24-Apr-22 12:30 PM] yang_mills#0000
Output per day: 46,53 AL net (after subtracting the AL used for BBH) and 13,29 BBH. Plus tiny surplus of 3,94 ALO per day.


[24-Apr-22 12:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
Your second Deimos, but requires a source of O and shipping. So you don't want anything sophisticated high tier there. Just more of the basic AL and BBH stuff.


[24-Apr-22 12:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is a fertile planet in KI-sector that is better than harmonia on paper. I have had similar thoughts about making it into a bread-basket planet if we ever ran out of room on harmonia


[24-Apr-22 12:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is good to consider. Its pretty involved though, to develop a new planet with LM, WAR and CoGC. Many BFABs required

[24-Apr-22 01:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps in the long run it would be better to turn Phobos into a 2nd agricultural planet with agricultural COGC. And move electronics to ZV-307b. Phobos has just enough water for growing crops. Not nearly enough for DW. So just growing crops there, and perhaps incinerating them for the carbon. Very basic, and all the new players can do that. As for the electronics, this would require a costly development of the infrastructure on ZV-307b. The electronics is perhaps the most elite economical branch in PrUn anyway. Rain had plans for electronics on ZV-307b. Unfortunately he is leaving the game.


[24-Apr-22 01:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It requires scientists, though, which can only be kept around by the various advanced POPI on phobos

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Apr-22 01:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think uprooting phobos as the electronics planet is a no-go.


[24-Apr-22 01:14 PM] yang_mills#0000
You see, since Phobos has so much more PIOs than SCIs, the total demand for education from all the PIOs is higher that from SCI.


[24-Apr-22 01:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It was rains idea originally to make it electronics.


[24-Apr-22 01:14 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes.


[24-Apr-22 01:16 PM] yang_mills#0000
So all these low tier pops massively increase the needs for comfort, culture and education, just because of their sheer number.


[24-Apr-22 01:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
That's a problem in the game mechanics. The need fulfilment is calculated for all the population, not by population tier. So to keep SCI happy one has to satisfy the needs generated by the masses of PIOs.


[24-Apr-22 01:19 PM] yang_mills#0000
So on a planet with proportionally less PIOs per scientist, one would need less infrastructure.


[24-Apr-22 01:20 PM] yang_mills#0000
On Phobos the social pyramid has such an unnecessary large base because its an obvious starter planet, with all the new players and their PIOs.


[24-Apr-22 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You need a large base to educate high tier workers from, and generate tax revenue


[24-Apr-22 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I expect many of these new bases will disappear


[24-Apr-22 01:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If we come out of it with a planet pop more heavily weighted to pioneers, we can increase tax on pios and upgrade infrastructure accordingly to meet the new stable population levels


[24-Apr-22 01:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this would be faster, and far cheaper/easier than developing scientists on a new planet and moving high tier production lines there


[24-Apr-22 01:23 PM] yang_mills#0000
Tax revenues, yes. But one could tax more the profitable electronic jobs. For the education one does not need that many lower tier pops. Last time when there was an education program 3 on Phobos, it generated 3 times as many scientists as there were jobs for them.


[24-Apr-22 01:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am already looking to upgrade the PAR this term, although we will need to do more to keep comfort up in long term i think


[24-Apr-22 01:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We can do education 1 or 2, in that case. Also I am fine with taxing electronics, but really its not that many players compared to the masses of pioneers. we should do both probably.


[24-Apr-22 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also the new players are the ones putting the burden on us in this case, they should pay a fair share for us upgrading the infrastructure in reaction to this situation


[24-Apr-22 01:27 PM] yang_mills#0000
Totally agree. Moreover, they have been warned that Deimos and Harmonia offer a better start.


[24-Apr-22 01:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[25-Apr-22 03:46 AM] yang_mills#0000
Does anyone have copper ore? @domicius ?


[25-Apr-22 05:33 AM] domicius#0000
Yes I do. Also CU. How much do you need.


[25-Apr-22 09:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
It depends. How much do you ask for CUO and for CU? Do you have it only on KI-840c, or do you have it closer, say on Deimos?


[25-Apr-22 09:37 AM] domicius#0000
CU goes for 1k currently, and CUO probably 300ish. You can always make an offer for a lower price if that's too high. 

I mine the CUO on KI-840c, and process on KI-840c and Phobos (due to the difficulty of shipping Oxygen around) so any shipping is extra unless I am picking something up on Deimos.


[25-Apr-22 09:38 AM] domicius#0000
To be specific, I fulfill out of Phobos, so you don't need to come to KI-840c


[25-Apr-22 10:10 AM] namthorn#0000
it's actually easier to ship the SIO and O to KI-840 rather than shipping the CUO out for processing. A shipload of oxygen lasts 43 runs, whereas a shipload of CUO only lasts 24 runs. shipping the CU back is a bit more demanding but if you're going for something like BCO or SCN you can produce on site and that drastically cuts down your shipping needs for the way back.

what do you think of KI-446b?

8 jumps from ANT, better fertility and H2O content than harmonia


[26-Apr-22 04:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
not worth considering until harmonia is maxed out i think


[26-Apr-22 04:31 PM] namthorn#0000
worth it for the long run if we plan on building up the area, lot of juicy planets in the KI sector that would love a close-by supply point


[30-Apr-22 04:59 PM] yang_mills#0000
I seriously consider building at some point a base on YK-649b. This planet offers a lot of SIO, twice as much as Phobos. But it's not about the SIO. It's a rocky planet without extra requirements and it's one jump away from Harmonia. The jump is long though. The idea is that one wants to maximise the number of farms on Harmonia, and put the food processors and the incinerators somewhere else. YK-649b could be used just for that. On can fill this planet with 12 HB1, 1 STO, 1 EXT (for the SIO, will free room on Phobos), 12 INC and 16 FP. When fully built up, it consumes more crops than an optimised base on Harmonia could provide. So actually crops from a second Harmonia could also go there. There is already one base on YK-649b. If there are more people who would like to settle there, we could even build a COGC that would provide a food processing (for FP) or resource extraction (for EXT and INC) bonus. It would be a PIO paradise.


[01-May-22 02:32 AM] allocater#0000
interesting, I will definitely build a FP base next, candiates are:
YK-649b (cheap crops from harmonia)
KW-602c  (cheap water from Etherwind)
QJ-149c (cheap water from ice station alpha/ANT)
KW-020c (cheap crops from benton)

[06-May-22 04:43 PM] namthorn#0000

I think it would be interesting to expand in the KI area. There is a bunch of interesting planets over there: KI-446b, KI-446e, KI-439d, KI-448b=Hermes, KI-840c, KI-401b, KI-401d, IY-028c=Electronica. KI-446b would be a nice bridgehead.


[08-May-22 04:30 PM] namthorn#0000
go ki-439b over ki-439d. you get LIO and HAL, perfect for LI smelting.


[08-May-22 04:30 PM] namthorn#0000
but ye would be down to do some farming meself, one industry i dont have a base plan for atm.


[08-May-22 05:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Okay, then. Lets put a timeline and real commitment towards this. 

for the planetary infrastructure, i make the following suggestions:

1. Local market (greatest utility)
2. Warehouse (2nd greatest utility)
3. chamber of global commerce
4. planetary administration


[08-May-22 05:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for the chamber of commerce, i suggest food processing bonus. However, we should also seriously consider pioneers +10% bonus.


[08-May-22 05:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since we require local extraction and farming, it could be greater total efficiency gain


[08-May-22 05:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, we should delegate who will be in charge of procurement for these building supplies.


[08-May-22 05:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I would prefer that we spend 2 weeks stimulating in-corp BFAB and LFAB production to build up the necessary supplies. At the same time, we can dollar cost average into fabs on AIC and NCC markets


[08-May-22 05:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone taking volunteers to help me organize and provision these building supplies on KI-446


[08-May-22 05:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, count me in for a specialized base on planet. I will happily do RIG since it is probably the most boring.


[08-May-22 05:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would be happy to be part take in the colonisation of KI-446b. It happens so that I just have 1 free base permit. My main motivation: it will be very fun. I think we would need 3 full weeks of preparation. Let's aim for the first settlements beginning of June. Also will have more IRL time at that point.


[08-May-22 05:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I agree, we need 2 weeks prep time to gather resources without putting pressure on our existing operations


[08-May-22 05:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I plan to tear down my LS-231 base to free up a permit. Who knew it would be harder to get rations than tungsten?


[08-May-22 05:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The amount i have gathered is enough for 12+ ships


[08-May-22 05:34 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also my base on Harmonia is now full.


[08-May-22 05:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also all the people interested should settle on the planet on the same week, so as to benefit from the explorer's grace bonus.


[08-May-22 05:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can use some stuff


[08-May-22 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
We can make deals for prices


[08-May-22 05:38 PM] yang_mills#0000
I think you misunderstood me. By full I meant that I reached the area limit. I cannot add more buildings. I didn't mean that my inventory is full, because it isn't.


[08-May-22 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ah like that. 😂


[08-May-22 05:43 PM] yang_mills#0000
Where are displayed the costs of planetary projects?


[08-May-22 05:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
POPI


[08-May-22 05:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh, also PPS


[08-May-22 05:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there should be POPI and PPS for all planets


[08-May-22 05:47 PM] yang_mills#0000
See it. Do we have the light prefabs from yaro? How much?


[08-May-22 06:16 PM] namthorn#0000
agree on the pioneer cogc, at least for the first one. after that we can look at bottlenecks and speed them up


[08-May-22 06:18 PM] namthorn#0000
I can probably head to KI-446 when i next go to KI-439, should have plenty of room. Will let you know a day or so before i head out that way.


[08-May-22 06:23 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, I too would prefer a PIO bonus at the COGC.


[08-May-22 06:24 PM] yang_mills#0000
We should plant our bases in a synchronised way. And we need 3 weeks of preparation.


[08-May-22 06:32 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, i meant as DLR has a ton of stuff to transport


[08-May-22 06:32 PM] namthorn#0000
unless thats tungsten?


[08-May-22 06:33 PM] namthorn#0000
i assumed 12 lots of cargo hold usage lol


[08-May-22 06:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i can do it with 2 normal ships. The base is quite small with only 2 RIG


[08-May-22 06:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
about 700t of BTS and then building supplies


[08-May-22 08:38 PM] aegis76#0000
id be willing to start a base on KI-446b once i have my main base running smoothly


[09-May-22 01:09 AM] yang_mills#0000
I would advise you to first build a base on Harmonia and fill it. Harmonia is an agricultural planet which is just one jump away from Deimos. KI-446b is 8 jumps away. We plan to settle on  KI-446b because we have already maximised our bases on Harmonia.


[09-May-22 01:18 AM] domicius#0000
Speaking of which, does anyone in Corp require a steady supply of REA or CU? I am considering expanding my base on KI-840c to process more CU/REA, but it's only really worth it if someone wants to buy the stuff.


[09-May-22 01:39 AM] rune_242#0000
Same, I'm in too


[09-May-22 01:45 AM] allocater#0000
we could look into setting up more people with REA->money conversion infrastructure. It needs DCM and SAR, so more printers and electronics chains. I can't convert more REA into money atm but if anyone has free space on heph/phobos they could do it.


[09-May-22 01:46 AM] allocater#0000
long term QJ-149 can be food production and KI-446 can be farming


[09-May-22 03:18 AM] namthorn#0000
yea i'd buy REA on the regular, would save converting BRM myself.


[09-May-22 03:33 AM] domicius#0000
How much would you need weekly?


[09-May-22 04:30 AM] namthorn#0000
I'd take 50/week


[09-May-22 10:33 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hey all, with the price of STL going insane I stopped making PT (like a week ago) and now have offloaded pretty much all of my reserves throughout the corp. Does anyone make STL - maybe on @Deimos? I'm happy to pay inflated prices to get some - just not the current 2500/u on the market.... I would estimate the price of PT is going to blow up soon so we should make an effort to continue an in-house supply chain. Let me know if you can supply STL!


[09-May-22 10:33 AM] rune_242#0000
I have been making PT for about a week now


[09-May-22 10:34 AM] rune_242#0000
only one BMP though


[09-May-22 10:34 AM] rune_242#0000
I can provide 120 STL if you want


[09-May-22 10:34 AM] rune_242#0000
but it will take a week to produce


[09-May-22 10:35 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, so you make your own STL for PT production? Do you think you could cover corp demand? Then I'll focus on other stuff with my BMPs?


[09-May-22 10:36 AM] rune_242#0000
how high is corp demand?


[09-May-22 10:38 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I've been running PT once every 5 runs on 3 BMPs for the last month or so (prob around 5/day maybe) and I was moving that product throughout Deimos, Nike, and Phobos


[09-May-22 10:38 AM] rune_242#0000
every 5 runs...


[09-May-22 10:38 AM] rune_242#0000
so one BMP only making PT should be enough right?


[09-May-22 10:39 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yeah I think so


[09-May-22 10:39 AM] yjhasaday#0000
If you end up with extra you could always bring to the market and make bank on it too


[09-May-22 10:39 AM] rune_242#0000
230/u?


[09-May-22 10:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
that was my price but that assumes STL at only 900/u


[09-May-22 10:40 AM] rune_242#0000
I'l happy take over the PT production


[09-May-22 10:40 AM] rune_242#0000
I make my own😎


[09-May-22 10:41 AM] yjhasaday#0000

[09-May-22 02:23 PM] thummper#0000
hi just wondering if anybody in corp produces COF / if it would be worth me doing it? 
I like the farming related things but I'm not sure if it would be better to turbo scale up my carbon or if I should do some other things?


[09-May-22 02:26 PM] allocater#0000
go for it, I am not aware of any COF producers, you sure will have the entire corp ripping it from your hands 😄

[09-May-22 02:44 PM] yang_mills#0000
COF is indeed in high demand. However, the issue is really producing the input, the Caffeinated Beans CAF. It requires HYF and cannot be grown in FRM. And it requires a lot of H2O. So it is up to you to do the math and see if you would be profitable. Producing COF is definitely more challenging than producing C. An other option would be growing HER in FRM and reprocessing it into FIM.


[09-May-22 02:46 PM] yang_mills#0000
@thummper I will bring you mats for 1 HB1 and 2 FRM on Harmonia in about 2 days from now. Corp prices.


[09-May-22 02:46 PM] thummper#0000
perfect thanks & additional thanks for the info. I will do some maths and figure out what to do


[10-May-22 03:14 AM] rune_242#0000

[10-May-22 10:12 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
bfabs are definitely needed 🏗️😁


[10-May-22 11:33 AM] allocater#0000
I propose calling the planet KIAAS for now (4->A, 5->S) until it has a real name


[10-May-22 11:35 AM] allocater#0000
it would be good if someone runs a ship ANT<->Kiaas, so we can move b-fabs and supplies there in bulk and exports back. Then every base can request and sell on local market without everybody having to send their ship


[10-May-22 11:36 AM] rune_242#0000
I would first want to move all my PP2's to Nike


[10-May-22 11:37 AM] rune_242#0000
with the space make more SME on deimos and then start making fabs for Kiaas


[10-May-22 11:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i dont understand the AAS


[10-May-22 11:47 AM] allocater#0000
oh it's a 6 at the end, so it should be KIAAG ? too late! 😄


[10-May-22 11:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i dont feel strongly about the name, we can discuss it. Im not going to pay to name it for real in game, not sure how that process works


[10-May-22 11:49 AM] allocater#0000
maybe KIAAG is better, because it sounds less like KI-ASS 😄


[10-May-22 11:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we could stylize it like a fast food drive through


[10-May-22 11:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

You can ask on the bank channel


[16-May-22 09:20 AM] namthorn#0000
it's kind of a vicious cycle lol. More AL demand leads to more bfab demand to build smelters, more bfab demand leads to more pp2s being built which leads to more AL demand. I wonder when it'll settle.

[28-May-22 04:47 PM] yang_mills#0000
Since @yjhasaday will settle on QJ-682g, I will rather go for a PG base. What do you think about QJ-650c? It offers MGS, CLI and AUO.


[28-May-22 04:48 PM] allocater#0000
AUO is at MM but seems still profitable, people keep selling it


[28-May-22 04:49 PM] allocater#0000
with more and more ships coming online you could mine the MGS and process it on heph+griffenstone


[28-May-22 04:49 PM] yang_mills#0000
I consider QJ-650c primarily because of the MGS. The planet only requires SEA, and I have plenty of it.


[28-May-22 04:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
MGS + CLI is very valuable


[28-May-22 04:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The AUO was the main attraction a while ago, but now we observe significant inflation in game, and we find ourselves having issues on fundamentals like PG, AL, DW, etc.


[28-May-22 04:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In short think QJ-650c is an excellent candidate for a chemistry planet. @yang_mills the bank can help with this too.


[28-May-22 04:55 PM] yang_mills#0000
CLI is required for SOI.

☝️ 

[28-May-22 05:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also worth noting that BRM density is 2.5, making it an excellent application of OOG-3000 time


[28-May-22 05:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but also feasible for the 2000


[28-May-22 05:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
similarly, CLI density is 2.42

One can fill the planet with 2 HB1, 6 HBB, 1 STO, 2 EXT (for MGS and CLI), 1 BMP (for MGS->MG), 12 POL (for PG), 2 CHP (for SOI) and 6 INC (for C). Actually producing PG does not require a lot MGS. The bottleneck are the polymers plants POL and the area they take. With less than 1 EXT and 1 BMP one can feed 12 POL. The issue is that it also requires a lot of C (42 per day), and C is heavy and inconvenient to ship. Hence 6 INC. Agri products are easier to ship. With the slowest recipe, 6 INC cover only half the need in C. One could also use the fastest recipe. Then 2 INC cover 50% of the needs. The saved space can be used for one additional EXT and one additional CHP, for more SOI.


[28-May-22 05:34 PM] yang_mills#0000
With this setting, the output is 2K PG per day.


[28-May-22 05:35 PM] namthorn#0000
C is heavy to ship yes, but with a big ship you can feed it fine, if you can make more use of the space running something else.


[28-May-22 05:36 PM] namthorn#0000
I ship about 100-150C in a week making roughly 900 PG a day on griffonstone


[28-May-22 05:40 PM] namthorn#0000
Its also on the route to the ki sector so can assist with shipping in stuff semi-regularly


[28-May-22 05:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
So here is what one gets without the COGC bonus (there is no COGC on this planet now). With a chemistry COGC is works better.

[28-May-22 05:44 PM] namthorn#0000
MG is also dirt cheap and abundant on the CX, would save you 100 PIO and some space


[28-May-22 05:45 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yeah. It's really about finding space for the POLs.


[28-May-22 05:46 PM] yang_mills#0000
CLI is valuable though, and out of supply on the CX.


[28-May-22 05:49 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would keep the BMP however. It is also used to reprocess CLI into I, and I is rare and expensive.


[28-May-22 05:50 PM] yang_mills#0000
One could switch all the EXT to CLI, and the BMP to I, and buy MG on the CX.


[28-May-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000
fair, I know a couple farmers that are trying to get MHLs in corp, an Iodine source would help there

There was/is demand for HYF supplies is what I was going for. NS too.


[28-May-22 06:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
Another possible setup, without INC. Requires a lot of mass shipped in though. A strain on logistics. Note that the daily profit is 50K.

But combines perfectly with an AMM+H base on QJ-682g, which is just one jump away.

earthling will continue small scale ops on IY-206, but there is room there for more FF production if somebody is interested


[28-May-22 06:44 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yet another possible setup, with (only !) 10 POL, but 2 REF for some fuel. AMM comes from QJ-392g which is one jump away.

[28-May-22 06:46 PM] namthorn#0000
I dont think shipping would be a problem with the first one, 1 full 2k load of C would last you 17 days, if you plan on shipping out PG more frequently than that you're golden


[28-May-22 06:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
100k PG 🤑


[28-May-22 06:47 PM] yang_mills#0000
Is QJ-392g good for refining, or only for resource extraction?


[28-May-22 06:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I would say only extraction. Cold, low pressure gas planet is expensive to build up and maintain.


[28-May-22 06:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
refining on IY-206i can be justified if you factor in the benefits of FF production, but still it is expensive


[28-May-22 06:51 PM] namthorn#0000
i'd go IY-028c coupled with qj-382g for SF refining. BOR, AMM and H between the two worlds


[28-May-22 06:51 PM] yang_mills#0000
Don't remember who exactly, but rain or Visinvictus considered QJ-684b as a refining world.


[28-May-22 06:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
IY-028c=Electronica? Because of BOR?


[28-May-22 06:52 PM] namthorn#0000
yea pretty much


[28-May-22 06:52 PM] namthorn#0000
refine it into NAB, run NAB + AMM


[28-May-22 06:56 PM] yang_mills#0000
The logistics is not awesome though. Electronica is 6 jumps away from QJ-392g. And it is easier to ship 1 BOR (1.8 t) than 5 H (5*1 m^3).


[28-May-22 06:59 PM] namthorn#0000
true, but alternatively you're building on a cold gas giant world, or a third world and shipping both in


[28-May-22 07:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
Right. At least Electronica is on the route between KI-446b and ANT I.


[28-May-22 07:04 PM] namthorn#0000
ideally you'd have a third party make the NAB for you and not bother with the NAB base at all. If you wanted control of the full chain though, it's a conundrum that needs solved and there's no easy answer there.


[28-May-22 07:05 PM] namthorn#0000
i'm realising now why the refining tech tree stops at settler tech - the hard part for that industry is logistics by far


[28-May-22 07:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
NAB is available on the CX. Visinvictus appears to be the only producer in the area.


[28-May-22 07:06 PM] namthorn#0000
Aye for now, importing the mats saves a lot more hassle.


[28-May-22 07:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
BOR is also available on the CX. Again, Visinvictus has the monopoly.


[28-May-22 07:10 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, no one else wants to touch that chain locally I guess.


[28-May-22 07:10 PM] namthorn#0000
Though with fuel as cheap as it is currently, I'm inclined to say just bulk buying FF and SF might be a viable solution also


[28-May-22 07:12 PM] namthorn#0000
SF from BEN, FF from HRT


[28-May-22 07:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
Well, the MM sell order for SF is at 16 AIC, which is still reasonable.

@allocater How much CIS do you have?


[28-May-22 07:50 PM] yang_mills#0000
I could indeed buy a full Tayra of SF on Benten. That's 33 333 units. It will be used for the corporate ships. On my return on ANT I can give 16 K SF to @insensless72, for OOG-3000. I would need 330 K CIS for that. @allocater appears to have a lot of CIS, given all his orders on the currency exchange. To pay for the CIS, I could request AIC from @bitcoin_ape, if he agrees. This fuel will not be used for my personal ships, and will be stored separately on ANT CX.


[28-May-22 07:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

I could do the same kind of operation with FF as I did with SF. I could fill Tayra with 40 K FF on Hortus, at 9.32 ICA/u. That's the lowest price over there. I could give half of it to @insensless72, for OOG3000. I would need 373 K ICA for that. @allocater, do you have this amount? Also, @bitcoin_ape, would you agree to finance this operation?


[06-Jun-22 09:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
Actually it is better to fly for the FF with OOG3000 @insensless72. Because tons to m^3 ratio for FF is 5 to 1.

we have already started on KI-446b


[07-Jun-22 10:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
recently, though. It is still early days out there while we get more pioneers


[07-Jun-22 10:53 AM] allocater#0000
food processing candidates are 
YK-649b (cheap crops from harmonia)
KW-602c  (cheap water from Etherwind)
QJ-149c (cheap water from ice station alpha/ANT)
KW-020c (cheap crops from benton)


[08-Jun-22 07:13 AM] insensless72#0000
Ive had a few questions so let me explain my thought process behind the LST wave. While controlling a large portion of the LST supply and reaping the rewards is beneficial to us as a corp, keeping LST prices low on market will benefit us further in the future. keeping LST prices high on the market encourages competition, where as if they sit around 70ish on the market we sell more and there is less incentive for other players to push Nike and create their own rock collection. Now that the LST market is beginning to fall again we have the opportunity to make it less profitable for others. We will be in competition with each other on the market but that is a win win for all of us as we all benefit from each others expansion. Long story short lower prices = less revenue but = more sales in the future and more consistent flow of product since it also = less competition

@insensless72 
@yang_mills 
@allocater 

It seems like we would benefit from some kind of system to manage fuel on our major planets, stations, trade routes, etc.

I propose a few main points:

1. OOG ships should carry several fuel tanks worth of both fuel types to selected "refuel planets" along common flight routes

2. at least OOG member would maintain fuel inventory + trade offers on these LMs. This potentially allows for a profit margin/gas station type business.

3. OOG pilots maintain full ship refuels at these locations with long date 1 AIC corp buy offers and @somebody mentions


[12-Jun-22 02:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
#1 is meant as an initial push to distribute fuel resources. #2 could be me initially, but I would be willing to give this to anyone in corp really, or at least partial workloads.


[12-Jun-22 02:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have some thoughts on how to streamline the gas station business, and get better scale compared to alucard998's choice of business model


[12-Jun-22 02:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is the only existing gas station I have seen, and it seemslike he has poor volume


[12-Jun-22 03:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday Plenty of opportunity here since you are the main (only?) local fuel producer in corp


[12-Jun-22 03:17 PM] domicius#0000
I'm happy to help out. I don't make fuel tho. I would stockpile however.


[12-Jun-22 03:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I make a bit of fuel, but don’t really have a good source of the inputs the way YJ does. Happy to help out as appropriate. Been planning on asking all of you what you need most from my second base. Seems like FRMs have been discussed to help with C production, but I’m happy to do whatever. I’ve already gotten a big head start here, so want to contribute


[12-Jun-22 03:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
As far as the gas station goes, I would be able to procure fuel from the corp and bank funds.


[12-Jun-22 03:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
refineries are tricky, really this comes down to administrative work of managing FX (currency exchange) and local market sell offers simultaneously


[12-Jun-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and enough activity to keep offers up even as they are bought/sold


[12-Jun-22 03:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
new refineries and commitment to move hydrogen, etc, would really drive down our prices and make the whole thing more stable. That is definitely welcome, but it is no small feat.


[12-Jun-22 03:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
Phobos is a natural candidate for a fuel station.


[12-Jun-22 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes. Also Nike, since all taxes come back to us


[12-Jun-22 04:05 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I kind of already do this on Nike, Deimos, and Phobos but I don't keep too large a stock pile (usually about 4K SF and 1K FF).   My 5 REF seem to perfectly feed the corp - I haven't sold fuel on CX in maybe a month lol. I could build some more REFs on Nike with the HQ + experts bonuses


[12-Jun-22 04:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So, the idea is to maintain the reserve on the warehouses or base inventory of these planets, for example NIke/Deimos/Phobos like you have already said


[12-Jun-22 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also independently, each OOG pilot maintains full refuels on these planets in their own inventory, restocking from you


[12-Jun-22 04:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
after that, the fuel-holder(s) will maintain a set of AIC sell offers on the local markets where our reserve is located


[12-Jun-22 04:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
these are public facing sells, they will be competitively priced if we do it right. the goal is to undercut the CX


[12-Jun-22 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Side-by-side, I will work to guarantee liquidity into AIC from all other currencies, so anyone who wants to buy our fuel but cannot, will naturally check the FX and find that they can easily convert to AIC


[12-Jun-22 04:26 PM] domicius#0000
Very interesting


[12-Jun-22 09:35 PM] yjhasaday#0000
So I was out all day but now that I'm home I've read above more carefully - I can definitely ramp up fuel production now that I have QJ382 to supply H/AMM. Then I'm happy to sell at corp rates to anyone who is stocking planets (I think Marky's reserves should hold us while I build up my own stocks?). I can increase the amount I hold ready for corp on each planet so pilots will always have stock to keep their inventories flush. In this sense I can also volunteer to oversee LM sales on Phobos, Deimos, and Nike 🙂


[12-Jun-22 09:39 PM] yjhasaday#0000
From a strategic standpoint I'm assuming this is an effort to control the Antares fuel market (similar to LST)? If we are selling at reasonable prices on LMs then it is far less likely external players will get into the fuel business and allow us to control fuel supply/cost? If so I really like this idea because Antares is probably the worst region for proximity to fuel making inputs! I haven't seen too many major Antares players in fuel refining - the CX is often loaded with supply from Benton/Hortus traders/haulers

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Jun-22 09:39 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I think the only thing I would need from corp is the use of our OOG ships every once in a while to move GAL - its reasonably priced for the time being but really heavy for me to move with my own ships. In fact, I have plenty of liquid cash available right now - I could buy a massive amount right now if OOG-3000 ( @insensless72 ) could make a ANT -> Nike trip in the near future? For those unaware the GAL recipe makes SF almost 3 times faster than the NAB recipe (but NAB recipe is usually more profitable)


[12-Jun-22 10:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ill trust your judgement on the fuel recipes, although it is worth noting NAB inputs are more readily available with Nike + Griffonstone

[12-Jun-22 10:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
all of this sounds good, and if we go for this gas station business we can definitely get some free OOG shipping involved

is NAB fuel viable? because everyone is throwing NA away, I got 800 randomly gifted to me and LM is 25/u


[13-Jun-22 04:52 AM] namthorn#0000
should be, if you can get the BOR and H supply. NA is a waste product for the most part. I have 300 you can have if you want to be garbage disposal xD


[13-Jun-22 04:53 AM] namthorn#0000
couldn't comment if it's more viable than the other fuel recipes though


[13-Jun-22 07:56 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Really? I buy it on the CX right now (its pretty damn cheap lol). I'll take some from time to time 🙂


[13-Jun-22 08:06 AM] namthorn#0000
yea you can take it all for free if you come to griffonstone


[13-Jun-22 08:06 AM] namthorn#0000
people give the stuff away there


[13-Jun-22 08:10 AM] namthorn#0000
it's just not worth transporting unless you've got a use for it or excess shipping capacity. Stuff leaving griffonstone is usually high-value and you really dont want to waste cargo space on a 25/u junk item that takes up 1t/m^3 each when you could be sending out 500 more PG instead


[13-Jun-22 08:12 AM] namthorn#0000
reached the point now with having an AML that there is no free cargo space leaving the planet ever lol


[13-Jun-22 08:14 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Haha fair enough! Next time I'm low I will make a trip out, can probably bulk up on PG and other chem stuff too


[13-Jun-22 08:41 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Good news @everyone! (said like Prof Farnsworth from Futurama 👴 ) With all this fuel talk I've implemented the lower costs for H/AMM from QJ-382 in my spreadsheet and I can lower the corp price on SF and FF! You can now post your fuel ads on Nike, Phobos, and Deimos at the below prices - I've updated my pricing on the corp sheet to reflect this change.

SF @ 8/u
FF @ 8/u

[13-Jun-22 02:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000
On the gas station conversation, I'm helping YJ with producing fuel on Phobos.  Currently we're both sourcing GAL at the CX where it's 100/u (as low as it's been in 180 days).  I've done the math on a GAL mining base on ANT-1a, and even given the CX pricing for upkeep I pay, we could produce GAL for 23.5/u.  That would reduce our cost per unit of SF by 1.53 (currently 25% of my cost to produce SF; a significantly higher % for YJ) and given the planet is in the same system as Phobos, shipping would be very straightforward.  Anyone seeing something I'm missing?  Is this a good goal as we try to take over the fuel market?  I think the GAL recipe is very important given the volume it allows and the area constraints we have on bases.  One concern could be to scale up significantly might require investments in planetary infrastructure to grow the population, but I suppose that is just one more planet to govern?


[13-Jun-22 02:57 PM] churavis#0000
You're going to need a good source of TSH, it's expensive and low volume on the CX


[13-Jun-22 02:57 PM] allocater#0000
so even with NA at 25, the GAL recipe is still better? rip balance 😄

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Jun-22 03:04 PM] jackinabox86#0000
~~the NAB recipe is significantly more profitable (about 3.5k aic per day for my costs), but you get 300 less SF per day per refinery.~~


[13-Jun-22 03:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
~~at YJ's costs for AMM and H, that would level the playing field a fair bit more, but perhaps we have a easy way to stand up NAB production; I just don't know much about that yet~~


[13-Jun-22 03:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Nvm, checking that formula, I didn't adjust the profits for the longer time of the NAB recipe.  You actually lose $2k a day in profit doing the longer recipe and you produce less overall as we try to swamp supply


[13-Jun-22 03:12 PM] churavis#0000
Time is money, especially when workers insist on consuming luxuries like food and clothing


[13-Jun-22 03:14 PM] jackinabox86#0000
the TSH problem is a pretty major one though.  I'm looking around


[13-Jun-22 03:22 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It might be an issue that there is literally 0 infrastructure at KW-976c, but it would produce 30% more GAL for not the worst distance

@jackinabox86 Historically, the only problem with Antares 1a `PLI ZV-307a` is the High temperature conditions.


[13-Jun-22 08:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, i see this was already discussed. Well, anyways. OOG can produce TSH vertically if we are provided BER. Allocater and myself already source BER for shipbuilding, but we could talk about developing TSH if this is agreed upon as the best fuel strategy.


[13-Jun-22 08:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have already made TSH for my tungsten extraction base on LS-231a, but that was small amounts for a 2-RIG + 1 HB1 base


[13-Jun-22 09:49 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think KW-976c would be the answer if we decided to do this.  Not as high a cost to get started, still pretty easy to get to with our cheap fuel and 30% faster extraction. We’d need about 1 RIG per two refineries, and we’re currently running seven REF. That might end up being a lot of TSH if we do it in Antares

RIG are easier, so for convenience, lets assume its the hard one (EXT)


[13-Jun-22 10:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
3 HB1 + 5 EXT would support 10 REF, and we can benefit from in system non-FTL shipping


[13-Jun-22 10:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is an attainable amount of TSH hypothetically, but that doesnt mean it is cheaper or more efficient than another slow fuel solution


[13-Jun-22 10:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
developing and supporting a small extraction world is markedly easier if it is 0 jumps from phobos/ANT


[13-Jun-22 10:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
logistics too. much better availability. These are all things to consider


[14-Jun-22 08:20 AM] jackinabox86#0000
It's EXT; you're right.  Given the lower extraction rate on ANT-1a, it would be 1.5 REF to 1 EXT.  So we'd need 7 or so and 420 pioneers for 10 REF, but it would probably make sense to go up to 8/480 to support 12 REF.    1 TSH builds the base, then 5 TSH for HB1 and 8 for the EXT.  14 TSH total, plus other construction materials


[14-Jun-22 08:25 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it looks like no one has a PP4 though, so we might be paying market price?  336,000 atm.  Saving 1.4/u on fuel, that would take 12 REFs 30 days to hit ROI.


[14-Jun-22 08:49 AM] allocater#0000
if that plan wins, we can build a PP4 for TSH I think


[14-Jun-22 08:53 AM] namthorn#0000
it's probably better in the long run, fuel refining is more about the logistics. If you can dump down REFs on heph/phobos, the GAL import can be serviced by a glass ship, leaving only the AMM + H imports needing FTL travel


[14-Jun-22 09:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I figured my starter ship could do 17 REF days per run of GAL (199 per trip).  It's workable, but having a glass ship or the occasional run from the big boy OOG ships would make it very smooth.


[14-Jun-22 09:08 AM] namthorn#0000
you'd want to scale up though, no need to settle this world if you're not going big on the refineries


[14-Jun-22 09:08 AM] namthorn#0000
17 REF days turns into 2 days very quickly xD


[14-Jun-22 09:08 AM] churavis#0000
It might be good to have a Corp stl ship in the Antares I system for all the bases corp members have and the CX


[14-Jun-22 10:42 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think we might already? @allocater 500 capacity?


[14-Jun-22 10:47 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea we have it, but allocater already has it on a permanent loop from ANT -> Phobos -> Heph and it gets used heavily


[14-Jun-22 10:47 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
im down to build another, not sure who should pilot it.


[14-Jun-22 11:19 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hey all, @jackinabox86 and I have started posting the "gas station" ads across Phobos, Deimos, and Nike. I just wanted to remind @everyone that these are NOT for corp members! These are offers to the general public at full price. We are keeping stores of both SF and FF separate from these ads for corp purchase, if you need fuel please post a buy ad @8/u for what you need and we will fill it (I like to think I'm pretty quick at this but sometimes RL happens so no promises lol). You can always ping/DM me if you need something filled quickly 🙂 

PS Deimos is a little understocked so if you can be flexible fill up at Nike/Phobos for the first week while I get Deimos stock up

I don't even know how heat works 😅


[14-Jun-22 02:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I've been using the GAL recipe for SF, which makes 292 extra fuel per day and 1k in extra profit for me, but takes up 40t/40m shipping capacity per day per refinery.  Maybe it's worth just going with the NAB recipe, which would give us a bit less supply/profit, but saves us building a base/ship?  I love min-maxxing profit long-term, so the GAL base has its attractions, but I'm still up in the air


[14-Jun-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also NAB is pretty heavy on CHP time.


[14-Jun-22 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is a hard decision, I think numbers need to be run 😮


[14-Jun-22 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater the BPT and APT items add 25% and 75% damage reduction, respecitively, while flying within a high temp atmosphere


[14-Jun-22 02:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so you can couple it with LHP, get a nice speed at a low price, and not get killed on hull plates repair as much as you otherwise would be


[14-Jun-22 02:38 PM] dersix#0000
according to the wiki, a hot planet is not adding heat dmg, but one with dense athmosphere (the BLU simulation is supporting this)


[14-Jun-22 02:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, thanks for the fact check!


[14-Jun-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that could have been expensive…


[14-Jun-22 02:53 PM] dersix#0000
well, it was useful, as I have a high pressure colony in ANT II and sooner or later the plan for a glass also there


[14-Jun-22 03:49 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have it split at my REFs - I run 5 recurring lines 2 x NAB, 2 x GAL, 1 x FF. I find it balances nicely - it makes fuel pretty quick, doesn't burn through NAB or GAL too quickly, and provides a good ratio of SF to FF


[14-Jun-22 05:47 PM] megasaberexe#0000

I can start producing it on Griffonstone. How much total do you need?


[15-Jun-22 01:17 AM] insensless72#0000
Ultimately 100 every 5 days but thats not reasonable right away so as many as you could make. I could provide AMM


[15-Jun-22 01:18 AM] insensless72#0000
Also it requires a LAB, not sure if that was something you were planning on going into or not


[15-Jun-22 01:29 AM] erklein#0000
I already have 2 LAB on Griffonstone with plans for more, so that won't be a problem. It would help if you could provide AMM as that is the only limiting factor right now

[16-Jun-22 11:35 AM] churavis#0000
But you need stuff in order to make stuff


[16-Jun-22 11:35 AM] exeler#0000
I can't speak much about the higher tier goods, all I sell is Carbon, but I really like local markets. Much more interactive/fun to be trading directly with a person than via the CX.


[16-Jun-22 11:36 AM] rune_242#0000
you also have to fly to the CX


[16-Jun-22 11:36 AM] namthorn#0000
the only stuff you absolutely need is always accessible on the CX - basic construction supplies, consumables and fuel


[16-Jun-22 11:37 AM] exeler#0000
This has been my experience. I usually just buy my consumables from the CX.

[16-Jun-22 11:45 AM] domicius#0000
I mop up stuff from the CX all the time


[16-Jun-22 12:44 PM] insensless72#0000
One could also argue that "shadow markets" are helpful for new players. For instance we offer prices way lower than market value which players could opt to use or flip on the CX whichever is in their best interest.   Corporations hoarding every item of a certain product can be problematic, but would also allow for gaps in the market more players would fill


[16-Jun-22 12:46 PM] churavis#0000
New players need capital and cheap building materials. Old players need large quantities of basic inputs. A corp with both facilitates the trade of both of these in the absence of a formal banking system.


[16-Jun-22 01:09 PM] namthorn#0000
these markets are also essential to get goods TO the CX in the first place. No-one would invest in LST mines on Nike other than what they need for themselves if they had to ship all the excess out all the time.


[16-Jun-22 01:11 PM] namthorn#0000
it would kinda necessitate vertical production lines for heavy goods. No spamming ore driving the price down, no heavy metals.


[16-Jun-22 01:11 PM] churavis#0000
I certainly made good money transporting LST as a new player, it was a good source of extra capital and a way to use up extra shipping capacity.


[16-Jun-22 01:12 PM] namthorn#0000
there's only so much you can support with 2 ships and shipping contracts. not to mention the nightmare of having to receive it all at the CX.


[16-Jun-22 01:12 PM] churavis#0000
I did nuke the LST market once or twice


[16-Jun-22 01:14 PM] churavis#0000
Before I had a good understanding of what good velocity and market saturation is


[16-Jun-22 01:14 PM] namthorn#0000
nightmare of logistical chains too. Instead of taking goods from A -> B and selling at B, you have to go A -> CX -> B with two independent ships


[16-Jun-22 01:15 PM] namthorn#0000
fine for simple stuff. but would really hamper universe growth unless we got a major influx of players, bigger than the steam wave.


[16-Jun-22 01:51 PM] erklein#0000
I did like some of the ideas, or at least the sentiment behind them, i.e. expand more past the starter planets and add buildings that aren’t solely about resource output. This isn’t a fully fleshed out thought, but I wonder about implementing some kind of timer on starter worlds where eventually you have to leave to colonize new worlds or bear some sort of huge efficiency penalty


[16-Jun-22 01:55 PM] churavis#0000
I think there should be a gradual reduction in the natural resources of the starter planets or of the number of lower tier workers, so that after several months players have to decide whether to import those resources from far away or transition to a higher tier of industry. That's how it works in the real world, countries start out with the most basic, easiest to start, lowest skill industries and then move on to more complex, lucrative ones as their raw resources run out (or environmental concerns gain precedence) and human capital gets more skilled and more expensive.


[16-Jun-22 02:08 PM] namthorn#0000
you potentially screw over new starters that way. But I agree with the sentiment of offering more lucrative rewards for settling more adverse conditions.


[16-Jun-22 02:09 PM] churavis#0000
You'd just have to move the starters to other worlds


[16-Jun-22 02:12 PM] namthorn#0000
I think you just make the starters worse, a la phobos. and make planets better the further away from the CX they are


[16-Jun-22 02:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
if the starter planets were worse, it wouldn't be as big a deal if the starting capital was higher


[16-Jun-22 02:45 PM] churavis#0000
We wouldn't need more starting capital if we had banks and loans


[16-Jun-22 02:45 PM] churavis#0000
We wouldn't need any starting capital


[16-Jun-22 02:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I probably had a harder start going to Phobos as a constructor at first (heard an old youtube that you could instatrade the CX in system), but it was horribly slow.  Need to be able to either go into higher things faster or more fully vertically integrate early to make returns worth continuing to play (and eventually afford a move out of faction space)


[16-Jun-22 02:49 PM] churavis#0000
So you needed a loan?


[16-Jun-22 02:53 PM] jackinabox86#0000
one random loaned me 25k after a couple weeks, but I just bootstrapped with the starting capital so far.  it takes a long while to expand to a second base (even with the corp price mats I've acquired here).  I think the game would be a bit better off if we had an incentive to move further out paired with an easier starting path to do so


[16-Jun-22 02:59 PM] namthorn#0000
yea starting capital should probably increase over time. Or more easily accessible industries to start e.g. some basic electronics or chemistry at the pioneer tier,


[16-Jun-22 03:02 PM] namthorn#0000
abstracting services would be a decent idea - stuff not required to bootstrap an economy but benefits the economy as a whole later on.


[16-Jun-22 03:34 PM] exeler#0000
The problem with building any system that can benefit new players specifically is that it can also be used by veteran players, or it feels contrived, or there ends up being a huge drop off in productivity/fun once the initial boost wears off. 

I think if the devs wanted to really give new players a place in the economy, it'd be to have  veterans rely on the basic goods produced by new players. That way new players immediately have a place and purpose in the market. 

At least for me, I think that's already the case. I started off as a carbon farmer and it seems like that's a hot commodity. I've never had trouble selling it and there's been enough of a margin on it that I've not really had to think about optimizing much to turn a profit.

I personally don't think there's a problem if late game goods tend to be handled in LM orders rather than being dumped on the CX as long as the volume of basic goods, especially ones new players might be producing, on the CX is good enough to sustain new players.

So I was planning on building up my next base on ZV-639d to provide N and NS. Two questions: 1) Anyone have a supply of INS I can start buying from? 2) For gaseous planets, how does the area/3 for AEF actually work out (i.e. how does it round)?


[18-Jun-22 01:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@erklein the AEF rounds up, per building. Each building will require at least 1 AEF.


[18-Jun-22 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 5000 INS and 40 AEF ready on Nike for something like this. However, as I have recently told @thummper and others, in the past I have been pretty comfortable relying on the market for nitrogen.


[18-Jun-22 01:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am willing to be "outvoted" on this if multiple shareholders are saying we should have a strategic nitrogen source. I am currently of the opinion that a chemical plant base with H2O/LST/N imports is the best approach to the NS problem.

I'm quickly running out of space on my first base, I think I can add a permit to get some more space, but I've started trying to plan for a second base. Anyone got any recommendations? Anything we need more of?

I've seen NS and COF (I'm assuming the NS is for the COF?) mentioned a few times, and the CX is light on both. I've been not buying COF for my FRM/INC operations and would be interesting in getting into that chain if it's not something we already have a ton of.

There's also the idea of making my second base on `ki-446b` and going 100% FRM. I think that's kinda far out though, but if I don't need to fly a ship out there except super occasionally then I don't mind having two bases that are kind of independent from each other.


[24-Jun-22 09:41 PM] insensless72#0000
Things that come quickly to my mind are infrastructure upkeep mats. PFE, SOI, OFF etc. Were short on textiles like TK and KV. If you were to expand COF, KOM, and FIM are all good options as well


[24-Jun-22 09:49 PM] churavis#0000

@yjhasaday We should build a warehouse on QJ-382g. I need a lot of H for my base on QJ-650c, which is one jump away. I could buy it from you on QJ-382g LM, and then ship it to my base. This will avoid shipping all the H all the way to Phobos. I would be happy to contribute Bfabs to the warehouse.


[25-Jun-22 06:51 AM] dersix#0000

[25-Jun-22 07:25 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You may not want to spend your open base permit on expansion of an existing base. You only get 250 area that way, but a new base would give you 500 area. You can get the mats for a new base relatively easily in corp and that area will quickly get filled


[25-Jun-22 08:09 AM] namthorn#0000

[25-Jun-22 10:17 AM] domicius#0000
I've been thinking about this, but some vertical integration seems to pretty much require expanded bases, otherwise you're shipping shed loads of stuff around. Is there an upper limit to the number of bases you can have?


[25-Jun-22 10:37 AM] namthorn#0000
there's a softcap to it iirc, based on permit count, the cost gets more and more prohibitive the more permits you get


[25-Jun-22 10:39 AM] namthorn#0000
2nd base probably a good idea to get another 500 area unless you can get more out of 250 on a specialised world (like spamming SE on phobos)


[25-Jun-22 10:47 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sounds like a plan, do you want to go half and half on the bfabs? I can transport them out on my next trip out there - which should be in a couple days, then we can have the WAR operational within a week!

What if we added a 'Demand' page to the corp spreadsheet so that everyone can post the MAT's that they would like to buy regularly from the corp and how much that demand is being filled so that others can more easily plan expansions and production schedules

@everyone was there any discussion of a helium planet? This is a resource I would like to have a strategic supply of in corp, because it can awkwardly jam our ship building.


[26-Jun-22 10:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I mean normal HE, not HE3.


[27-Jun-22 08:02 AM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps a base on IY-206j? It offers only an average quantity of HE, but it also has BRM, has rather convenient logistics because it's on the route from KI-446b to Phobos, and it's a rocky planet (MCG+INS).


[27-Jun-22 08:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
Or ZV-307h, which is in the ANT 1 system (AEF+INS) ?


[27-Jun-22 08:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
Since our corp already has a supply of BRM, ZV-307h looks like a better option.

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[27-Jun-22 08:56 AM] namthorn#0000
id go with the ZV-307h. The logistical convenience is hard to pass up and we'd need to build the LM on either anyway. How much HE do people use per day roughly?


[27-Jun-22 09:00 AM] insensless72#0000
I dont think were burning it in crazy high numbers, I only use 5 per day for LHP. I know Yang is using it for his HWP, Allocater for CHA and its inputs, and Rune for SSC. Its probably below 50 total a day


[27-Jun-22 09:12 AM] namthorn#0000
kk. do we have AEF in stock?


[27-Jun-22 09:14 AM] namthorn#0000
i reckon you'll want something like 8 COLs to service ~50/d with some capacity to build a stock. so we're looking at around 70 AEF for that option


[27-Jun-22 09:24 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I have 35 NE on Nike, my PP2's are currently backlogged so it will take some time before I can make AEF but I can sell the NE to someone else if someone has PP2 availability? Unfortunately I bought the NE at market rate so I can't give a corp discount, let me know if anyone is interested!


[27-Jun-22 09:30 AM] insensless72#0000
If you sell me 10 NE I can get 2 of mine started on AEF


[27-Jun-22 09:41 AM] yang_mills#0000
IY-206j has a huge advantage of being an MCG planet. Since it  is on the way from KI-446b, one can add there some (or many) INC and burn the crops from KI-446b. Plus extractors for BRM. COL, EXT, INC and a resource extraction COGC would work perfectly. We don't need tons of HE, so it's better to have some additional use for the planet.


[27-Jun-22 09:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps one can also put INC on ZV-307h, but AEF is more expensive and harder to produce than the MCG.


[27-Jun-22 10:11 AM] namthorn#0000
MCG is easier sure, but I think the aef planet location is better for a small HE operation, as we naturally have more traffic in ZV-307. Provided we can sort the AEF situation out.  Setting up INC on an INS world is really not worth either imo. The crops are really the bottleneck there over burn time and setting up on KI-840c makes more sense for BRM extraction, requiring only SEA.


[27-Jun-22 10:12 AM] churavis#0000
i've got plenty of extra capacity for INC on KI-446b and room to build more if only i had the crops to burn

[27-Jun-22 10:17 AM] namthorn#0000
I'd agree with you if the aim was to maximize area use, but sometimes it's not worth it. HE is one of those resources that's tricky to get but not much is required. For what it's worth you could probably command a dominant market postion for a long time, given that theres 0 for sale across both AI1 & CI1 and it isn't exactly easy to get in this part of space.

HE would be nice to have


[28-Jun-22 07:06 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think the challenge is that any HE base close to ANT needs special materials because it isn't a Rocky normal temp/pressure base


[28-Jun-22 07:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000
so the actual extraction is easy, but we'd need to supply the special construction materials.  I'm not experienced enough to weigh in, nor do I know our stockpiles, but that's been the discussion.  What amount of convenience in terms of proximity vs startup costs


[28-Jun-22 07:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@exeler In this channel, 2 days ago I did an “at everyone” message requesting a new helium base


[28-Jun-22 07:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there was then extended discussion about sourcing AEF and INS, which it looks like we are in a position to do now


[28-Jun-22 07:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In short, OOG needs an insider helium producer, and can supply the special materials if you wanted to be that person

[28-Jun-22 09:23 PM] exeler#0000
I'd be down to throw up a base on `IY-206j` if that sounds like a good idea. I was also thinking of making a base on `KI-446b` and I kinda like the idea that @yang_mills had about having a combined `COL`, `EXT` and `INC` base going.

It looks like I could upgrade my HQ for pretty cheap since it's still level 1, but I'd like to make the most of the first few bases I have. Having a planet with multiple uses seems more in line with what I want to do at this point in the game than a very specialized base that chews up a permit just for a single resource.


[28-Jun-22 09:25 PM] churavis#0000
I've got MCG, MFK, OFF and UTS for the HQ upgrades


[28-Jun-22 09:35 PM] exeler#0000

I assume you mean COL, FRM, INC, not EXT?


[28-Jun-22 09:43 PM] exeler#0000
I've been getting all my bfabs on Deimos and taking them back to Harmonia since I deliver C to Deimos. Haven't really been thinking about upgrading the HQ yet since I still have a base permit. Literally just noticed the HQ upgrade is made of the same stuff all my FRM and INC are 😅


[28-Jun-22 09:43 PM] insensless72#0000
I meant for the upgrade fabs but I was mistaken about the planet, my bad


[28-Jun-22 09:44 PM] exeler#0000
I haven't looked at the planet much yet. I was just copy/pasting what was mentioned above 😅


[29-Jun-22 12:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@exeler I think IY-206j is a viable planet for a helium base. Will you do 500 HE shipments from there to Antares?


[29-Jun-22 12:09 AM] exeler#0000
I think that's a decent plan. Since I'm still early on, I've definitely not hit the point where shipping is my limiting factor, so I don't mind having a reason to keep a ship flying things around as long as it pays for the fuel.


[29-Jun-22 12:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
~3day round trip fuel cost is around 5-6k total, at 8 AIC per fuel unit


[29-Jun-22 12:19 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
HE is above 100 per unit everywhere.


[29-Jun-22 12:22 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
even at 50 per unit I think you would do fine on full ship loads


[29-Jun-22 12:25 AM] exeler#0000
Yeah, that sounds really reasonable. Each EXT makes ~10 per day on there right? So 5 EXT would be 500 every 10 days, 10 for 5 days? Do we have a huge need for it, or do we just want to have a stockpile for when the occasional demand spikes?


[29-Jun-22 02:13 AM] allocater#0000
a ship needs ~250 every 5d, so that's cutting it close. I would say 6 COL initially, but there is also the prospect of expanding it to 12 COL and depending on market demand even fill the base with 22 COL.


[29-Jun-22 02:15 AM] allocater#0000
so 1500 INS, who has it? the rest is available on deimos (-PSL),


[29-Jun-22 02:15 AM] allocater#0000
also lets upgrade the HQ 2 times, so you can also build the Kioog base

@yjhasaday I see that the warehouse on QJ-382g isn't ready yet. Perhaps there are some mats missing and I could provide it.


[29-Jun-22 06:52 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I forgot to bring them out on my last ship so I setup a shipping ad but a random picked it up. It's been in transit for 2.5 days now. Warehouse will be built once it arrives - should be any day now

That's a good question I've been asking myself. 

I'll do it if we can find the materials to make it happen. I was looking at prices of some of the things last night and it'll be a little bit before I have enough capital to get the stuff I need for the HE base.


[30-Jun-22 12:41 PM] exeler#0000
Takes me a little while to build up for an expensive base with just 4 INC making money for me 😅

except PSL on deimos and INS is still unclear


[30-Jun-22 01:11 PM] exeler#0000
I think there's some INS on the CX I was looking at, but it was pricey (I think?) and in short supply. 

I haven't checked the other CXs, but maybe I could fly out and find some cheaper(or just more abundantly) elsewhere?

Not at my PC to go hunting right now, but will take a look tonight.


[30-Jun-22 01:16 PM] allocater#0000
yeah if there is no INS in corp we will have to buy it on the CX 😥

[30-Jun-22 09:10 PM] exeler#0000
I put up a whole ton of ads on Deimos for all the MATs (plus a really appropriately priced unit of DW on Harmonia for anyone who really needs exactly one super high quality unit of DW)

If there's a better place to drop the ads for some of these MATs, let me know and I can move them and make a pit stop to pick it up.

Or if the prices aren't accurate, also let me know and I can adjust.

Thanks, I think some other people had mentioned some specific things that were also going to take another day or so. I'll see what's filled tomorrow and move some orders around to wherever the MATs are at.


[02-Jul-22 07:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
This is a bad time to bring this up given the holiday weekend, but the GAL situation (prime ingredient for the fast fuel recipe) is untenable.  I could load up and ship out 2002 to try to get another load from Katoa or Benten, but there is no supply on Katoa and a very small supply on Benten.  The supply is fairly limited or expensive everywhere else.  GAL used to be roughly 100/u and now it's not available in ANT for under 240.


[02-Jul-22 07:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Currently, I use 50-60 a day and YJ likely uses a fairly similar amount.  the NAB recipe isn't as profitable as the GAL recipe and it certainly produces less fuel over time


[02-Jul-22 07:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
so I'm returning to my GAL base idea, this time looking at KW-626a, which produces 25 GAL per day per EXT and only requires HSE to build the base versus INS or TSH


[02-Jul-22 07:45 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If I can pay corp prices for the materials (I need my second HQ upgrade for a permit along with the new base materials), I've got the capital on hand, but not sure if we've got the fabs and other materials available.  Given I have OOG2002, I don't really need to worry about the shipping required for the GAL once the base is built


[02-Jul-22 07:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Anything I'm missing?  If I buy the TCS, can someone run the HSE required through a PP3?


[02-Jul-22 07:56 PM] dersix#0000
I've 20 HSE available and can make more if required


[02-Jul-22 07:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think I'll only need 6 the first week for the CM, two HB1, and three EXT


[02-Jul-22 08:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Seems like a decent plan to me


[02-Jul-22 08:07 PM] churavis#0000
If the price of GAL stays high then I'm sure others will either join you or buy from you


[02-Jul-22 08:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Total materials needed other than the HSE from Pokter are 64 bse, 24 bbh, 16 bde, 8 bta, 4 lse, 4 lde, 4 lta, 20 tru, 516 mcg, 12 psl, and 20 off, if anyone has some of those available

I make GL on Deimos, currently 120 in stock @ 130/u. 
@bitcoin_ape I have 3 GF on Deimos, all of which are pretty new so I'm hoping it will start to help with the supply for corp GL needs - I've already chatted to @namthorn about it. I've offered to change my GF production if needed for ship building - right now they are all running GL -> TUB


[04-Jul-22 09:52 AM] namthorn#0000
build up some RG when you can, that'll help out nicely. We've got 1 gen made and i have the GNZs for another so a fair bit of leeway.


[04-Jul-22 09:55 AM] namthorn#0000

I still have over 1000 GAL you can take from on Nike, plus I have multiple suppliers on Katoa. Each has informed me that they have thousands of GAL stock available. I can arrange for you to pick up a shipload if you would like? Price generally runs between 65-75 per unit

[10-Jul-22 12:53 AM] allocater#0000
QJ-149c was also a candidate


[10-Jul-22 12:54 AM] churavis#0000
I'm planning on turning YK-649b into a glass metallurgy planet


[10-Jul-22 12:55 AM] churavis#0000
It will take weeks just to get enough settlers, however, and almost all the infrastructure has yet to be built


[10-Jul-22 06:03 AM] namthorn#0000
would it be worth it to build an ADM there? then you can run settler migration to speed it along a bit


[10-Jul-22 06:08 AM] namthorn#0000
yea they are, you need ~2 FRMs on HER for every FP running FIM


[10-Jul-22 08:29 AM] churavis#0000
I'm not sure, it's just me and two other randos and I'm already governor of a planet.

yeah I have a base there, but it counts more to BEN


[10-Jul-22 12:59 PM] allocater#0000
Antares has now the lowest DW price


[10-Jul-22 06:40 PM] insensless72#0000
Anyone have 6 KV I can buy on any planet?


[10-Jul-22 06:40 PM] insensless72#0000
That will get me to 12 ASE and 12 ADE


[10-Jul-22 07:19 PM] churavis#0000
I have 4 KV on Deimos and 4 on the cx and more in production on Hephaestus


[10-Jul-22 07:19 PM] churavis#0000
Price is on the sheet


[10-Jul-22 07:35 PM] insensless72#0000
Ad up for your 4 on Deimos


[10-Jul-22 10:21 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have 9 available on Phobos


[11-Jul-22 12:52 AM] allocater#0000
now 12 on heph unless they are reserved for "the project"


[11-Jul-22 03:11 PM] churavis#0000
If I made an FE/STL base on antares II b, how much would the corp buy?


[11-Jul-22 03:12 PM] insensless72#0000
depending on how much you produce I would buy it


[11-Jul-22 03:12 PM] insensless72#0000
I need it for FET, UTS, and STL


[11-Jul-22 03:14 PM] churavis#0000
It's already got a metallurgy CoGC, I would just need at least 10 HSE to get started and more to scale up. I would probably also want to make a glass stl ship before it got too big.


[11-Jul-22 03:15 PM] dersix#0000
I've still 40 HSE on phobos


[11-Jul-22 03:18 PM] dersix#0000
I would buy something in the order of 100 STL/week or the equivalent in FE/FEO


[11-Jul-22 03:20 PM] churavis#0000
It sounds like there's a pretty healthy demand so I'll put a plan together tonight


[11-Jul-22 03:22 PM] allocater#0000
but why was ZV-759b colonized before SE-110d?


[11-Jul-22 03:23 PM] allocater#0000
just because STL travel? That's no longer that relevant


[11-Jul-22 03:24 PM] churavis#0000
It's relevant if you're middle game and can only afford a glass ship


[11-Jul-22 03:24 PM] allocater#0000
but we are endgame! 😄


[11-Jul-22 03:25 PM] churavis#0000
Not everyone is end game


[11-Jul-22 03:25 PM] allocater#0000
also if you can make FE cheaper than AL we can produce FE BSE/BBH/BTA


[11-Jul-22 03:25 PM] churavis#0000
I'll have to run the numbers to see


[11-Jul-22 03:37 PM] namthorn#0000
logistics, not just thinking about GL ships, You can only haul so much FEO at a time, the more jumps you add into the flight plan the slower your smelting operation has to go


[11-Jul-22 03:39 PM] namthorn#0000
flight time from se-110d is like 16hrs, from ant 11b its around 6. You can go twice as fast with the smelting if you're importing from ant IIb


[11-Jul-22 03:45 PM] churavis#0000
I don't have the shipping capacity for SE-110d, especially then it comes to heavy ores/metals


[11-Jul-22 03:46 PM] namthorn#0000
it's just really inferior imo. by the point you have INS, you likely can get HSE too. before that you can import from phobos


[12-Jul-22 03:27 PM] rune_242#0000

Exeler is working on it, in the meantime there is HE on the CX if you need it. I picked up 100 earlier


[12-Jul-22 04:09 PM] rune_242#0000
Did you fly already?


[12-Jul-22 04:10 PM] insensless72#0000
i didnt have a ship out there, im having Allocater move it to Heph for me


[12-Jul-22 07:10 PM] exeler#0000
Not yet, gonna send the ship tonight. Server issues last night overlapped pretty much perfectly with all of my available play time.


[12-Jul-22 10:57 PM] exeler#0000
I've got 180 HE flying back now. Is consumption high enough that it's worth doubling my base out there for 12 col? My production should go up a good bit once I ship some PWO and COF, and the popr fills in the pioneers to staff all the col without having to upgrade the base any more.

{Reactions}

[12-Jul-22 10:57 PM] exeler#0000
I could instead build an AL refinery on Deimos.


[13-Jul-22 01:07 AM] allocater#0000
yes consumption would consume ~250 per ship + other random things + very good market situation. I'd say definitely worth having 12 COL


[13-Jul-22 01:08 AM] allocater#0000
as for AL on deimos: por que no los dos 😄


[13-Jul-22 05:49 PM] exeler#0000
Because one has to come first. I plan on doing both, just a question of order :D


[14-Jul-22 12:07 PM] allocater#0000
oh ho, even Universal Reserve went down to 49.99 for DW


[14-Jul-22 12:08 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, what is up with the DW price? Is it because OVE is so high that everyone's making RCO instead of RAT ingredients?


[14-Jul-22 12:10 PM] allocater#0000
nah, just massive investments into DW infrastructure


[14-Jul-22 12:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think there are some producers who can make DW but don't have FRMs and can't make RATs


[14-Jul-22 12:10 PM] allocater#0000
volume is even still increasing


[14-Jul-22 12:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also the price of H2O is way down


[14-Jul-22 12:12 PM] allocater#0000

[14-Jul-22 12:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a while my PRUNner was telling me about the fantastic returns of DW, so large investments wouldn't surprise me

I can fit 508 FEO or 381 FE on Bucephalus if we need large shipments moved in the future


[17-Jul-22 03:29 PM] churavis#0000
That is good to know. It's a small operation now but I will likely expand it given the corp's demand for FE and STL


[17-Jul-22 03:34 PM] dersix#0000

You can just keep running 1 so it's easier. I take either one.


[21-Jul-22 02:39 PM] allocater#0000
with contract templates I think it could make sense to prepare standard shipping contract template and send them to the dedicated shipper for a dedicated route instead of posting on the LM. For that we would need more regular shipping schedules though, so we know for example who does the nike->deimos route.


[22-Jul-22 12:01 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Hi all, this isn't urgent/high priority but I thought I would toss the idea out there in case one of you is pondering your next base location. I am struggling to keep up with corp demand for H and I have now maxed my base on QJ-382g (POPR still catching up but my max output will be somewhere around 600 H per day - you can read that as: not enough). If another corp member were to expand to a H planet it would help me greatly! I've posted some good planet options below (within 4 jumps of ANT and 30+ H concentration). Also you could consider ZV-307g as well - its concentration is a bit lower but it is right in the ANT system so its very convenient. ZV-759g is in Deimos' system so it would also be a convenient choice! You could always join me on QJ-382g where OOG has already built infrastructure and I will be making common trips with the OOG-2003-Planet Express!

Where is the H needed? Or are people picking it up ?


[22-Jul-22 05:57 PM] insensless72#0000
BMP, POL, REF, CHP, LAB


[22-Jul-22 05:58 PM] insensless72#0000
probably just about every planet we control


[22-Jul-22 06:03 PM] dersix#0000
I was asking logistics wise, because I can upgrade my AR-base on ki-401d for additional H (but I'm a bit worried getting it off planet)


[22-Jul-22 06:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Bucephalus? I doubt ill hit 1000 TIO before it makes its way back out there. I could just swing by and pick up some H as well


[22-Jul-22 06:07 PM] insensless72#0000
Though I will say its one of the most limited m^3 ships we have


[22-Jul-22 06:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I am happy to help pick up H at KI


[22-Jul-22 06:09 PM] dersix#0000
I can do ~1.3k m^3 per day when I fullydevelop the base


[22-Jul-22 06:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
With 2003


[22-Jul-22 06:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000

ok, I'll collect stuff for an upgrade


[22-Jul-22 06:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
also, if you have shipping needs, let me know.  I pick up a lot of your nice ads, but I'm happy to do it cheaper.  Don't always have ships available, but I like to keep them busy


[23-Jul-22 01:55 AM] allocater#0000
If we can fill existing bases, that's even better. Can't have any unused space! 😄


[23-Jul-22 01:57 AM] allocater#0000
you can test hanging 500 H sales at 50/u on the LM, maybe others pick it up too, and if not, we will pick it up


[23-Jul-22 04:45 AM] namthorn#0000
griffonstone & wherever the fuel ops people are set up. I go through about 200/week atm personally.


[23-Jul-22 07:32 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I can also send my 2000 out periodically as well! I don't think moving H should be a concern, OOG has plenty of 2000 capacity ships available. Plus with the update coming we'll be able to upgrade standard ships too!

@everyone Have you seen the new dev diary? https://com.prosperousuniverse.com/t/release-notes-convergence/4862 There will be an update on Wednesday August 3rd, and ship upgrades will be introduce. This will create a market for unbundled ship components, as players will buy these for the upgrades. Our corporation should step into this new market.

Unfortunately the upgrades will be locked behind the PRO licence, which greatly reduces the number of potential customers.


[25-Jul-22 08:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
We should anticipate what would be the most demanded components. In particular, the players will prioritize upgrading their 2 starting ships. I will switch from LHP to BHP, since the latter are used in the starting ships.


[25-Jul-22 09:00 AM] rune_242#0000

Perhaps we should fix price tags for every component and advertise in the game chat, UFO, official PrUn Discord and on the forum that our corp can sell the spare parts at these prices.

the bottleneck for upgrades is TI by the sounds of it. I'm sure we can come to some sort of round-robin style deal once we have the bottleneck fixed


[25-Jul-22 10:25 AM] insensless72#0000
my plan is to produce as much TIO as possible on 401b, bring it back to Deimos and hand it off to you guys cheap


[25-Jul-22 10:26 AM] namthorn#0000
i think we should as members that want upgrades, help accelerate this though. Anyone with shipping capacity should drop by either 401b or se-648c and take some TIO


[25-Jul-22 10:26 AM] namthorn#0000
the more we get, the faster we can go after all


[25-Jul-22 10:27 AM] namthorn#0000
ive got about 2 shiploads that im going to schedule in this week


[25-Jul-22 10:28 AM] insensless72#0000
We also need to figure out a good going rate for TI internally. LCB and WCB are so expensive mainly due to TI prices. So the lower I buy TI for the cheaper the upgrades become


[25-Jul-22 10:28 AM] allocater#0000
is the TIO base already maxed with EXT?


[25-Jul-22 10:29 AM] namthorn#0000
I can run my smelters at a loss for a while so I can just hand you the TI I make


[25-Jul-22 10:29 AM] namthorn#0000
but i dont exactly have a lot of them lol


[25-Jul-22 10:30 AM] insensless72#0000

Is there any NE in corp?

I've got 18 on Deimos you can have. 250/u


[28-Jul-22 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Soo... I have been looking at getting into a new industry that would compliment my Farms and soon to be online Chem Plant, which would let me fill a unique role in the corporation. After looking at the Corp Production Spreadsheet, it appears that no one has a Fermenter operation, and I am especially interested in producing GIN.


[28-Jul-22 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Of course the biggest factor in producing the GIN product would be how much demand is there in the corporation? I see a lot of building that require workers that use GIN, but are the players who use those workers going to buy Kowa-Bunga GIN? I thought that I would ask here.


[28-Jul-22 09:22 AM] rune_242#0000
I was thinking about the same thing yesterday


[28-Jul-22 09:22 AM] rune_242#0000
but I was planning on making KOM and ALE


[28-Jul-22 09:36 AM] erklein#0000
I think there is room for more FER, especially as a lot of players continue to expand. I know that with my 1 FER I usually produce KOM and occasionally ALE and that's enough to cover my needs with a little excess to sell to the corp if someone needs it. So for KOM and ALE, I would think there is space for more of them. As far as GIN, I don't know how much more production capacity is needed since engineers are relatively rarer, so I'm hoping someone who has them can weigh in on that front

[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] insensless72#0000
GIN would be a tricky one. I wont speak for everyone but as of right now I avoid most Engineer consumables due to pricing. By doing so I keep the price of engineer products lower for corp


[28-Jul-22 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
@insensless72 But would you buy it if it was at a fixed, reasonable price? and if so, how much would you purchase?

@everyone Do we still need expanded H production? I know it seemed like we did for a while but I'm wondering whether that was just because it took time for YJ's expansions to work through pent up demand. has anyone needed to buy H from the CX lately? CX prices are still high.


[02-Aug-22 07:34 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I get a lot from YJ, but still get a lot from the CX. The more supply, the better


[02-Aug-22 08:25 PM] erklein#0000
I would also like greater H production


[02-Aug-22 08:32 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Ya I think the need is still there. I have been running on the bare minimum to allow for more H distribution - I would like to create a good stockpile and finally breath easy lol


[02-Aug-22 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000

[02-Aug-22 08:34 PM] churavis#0000
The next question is where is the H needed?


[02-Aug-22 08:34 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Actually, its not (shipping that is). I can't extract the H fast enough! 14 COLs (600 H per day) doesn't seem to cut it


[02-Aug-22 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

[02-Aug-22 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think thats an easy question to answer, a couple more bases, the rest goes to CX at top bid 📈


[02-Aug-22 08:41 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I've asked this question a couple times and wasn't able to get a definitive answer 😦 my REFs are on Nike and they chug through 100/day. My other bases have much smaller H needs. 

I think Heph has high demand because of all the PE being made. @jackinabox86 has REFs on Phobos, and I would imagine Griffonstone has some demand as well


[02-Aug-22 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I can get a good source of C I’d setup Heph for PE, should have a good amount of H consumption


[02-Aug-22 08:53 PM] churavis#0000
I'm trying to decide between ZV-307g and ZV-759g, in Antares I and Antares II respectively.
Both are INS gas giants with a CoGC
ZV-307g will allow for STL only ships to transport to CX, Phobos and Heph and has some N
ZV-759g has richer H deposits and a WAR and I already have an STL ship in the system that will have plenty of capacity and is closer to Nike and Griffonstone


[02-Aug-22 09:21 PM] churavis#0000
At full capacity, ZV-759g would produce 16,717 more H than ZV-307g but logistics are easier with the latter.


[02-Aug-22 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
16,717 more H in how much time?


[02-Aug-22 10:10 PM] churavis#0000

[02-Aug-22 10:46 PM] churavis#0000
Sorry, 16,717 AIC worth of H at current prices, 196 more units of H per day


[02-Aug-22 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats a bit more reasonable


[02-Aug-22 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I were settling a H COL base I’d go for 307g


[02-Aug-22 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
It being in 307 is a huge advantage


[02-Aug-22 11:44 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But he already has an stl ship in 759. That argues for that system, and shipping is about to be even less of a bottleneck with upgrades. All things considered, I’d go with more H than less and build in 759.


[02-Aug-22 11:45 PM] churavis#0000
That is my major holdup as well. I already needed an STL ship for my FE/STL base but it will have extra shipping capacity


[02-Aug-22 11:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
We will have the 2000s crawling in that space, so it’s not really a constrained territory regardless of where you build. Higher production/return over time seems preferable

They still have a day and a half to finish 😦 But after that I am 100% doing the MAI+GRN+HCP recipe until long into the future.

who else will join this?


[03-Aug-22 02:38 PM] allocater#0000
INC base or FP base? INC base I would join. But for both we also need more farm bases.


[03-Aug-22 02:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I would probably join for INC if we switch Demeter to full ag. Easier to ship crops from out there than C


[03-Aug-22 02:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
FP seems too niche before we have the C supply sorted.


[03-Aug-22 02:42 PM] rune_242#0000
so first we build on QJ-149c?

There are never enough farms!  They aren’t the most profitable, but we do need them


[03-Aug-22 04:15 PM] churavis#0000
They are the foundation of our most profitable production chains


[03-Aug-22 04:19 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If they were particularly profitable, you’d see a return for them on the CX or LM. I don’t really see that, and that is compounded by the amount of area they consume (arguably our scarcest resource)


[03-Aug-22 04:20 PM] rune_242#0000

shouldn't a hydro farm use less water?

and also making 10 HYF is super expensive


[03-Aug-22 06:10 PM] rune_242#0000
I have a new idea


[03-Aug-22 06:10 PM] rune_242#0000
maybe we should a lot of HYF with a agriculture GOGC


[03-Aug-22 06:11 PM] rune_242#0000
and have a closeby water planet with resource extraction


[03-Aug-22 06:11 PM] rune_242#0000
with enough N I believe this would be the answer to the C/RAT/DW issue


[03-Aug-22 09:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But is the expense of that worth it? The length of the ROI is pretty high. We’ve got Demeter ready to go as an Ag planet with minimal additional investment needed


[03-Aug-22 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
In my math, MUS can outperform BEA a bit in RAT production, and that frees up some  space in the FRMs for carbon producing plants. But that assumes a lot of maxed FRM planets, and separate HYF planets.


[03-Aug-22 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Using HYF for VEG/MAI/HCP doesn't seem to make sense


[03-Aug-22 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000

[03-Aug-22 11:32 PM] exeler#0000
I think FRM is the way to go. 5X water input and an expensive addition for slightly faster crops?

I think the story is the same for other carbon plants. I have no idea about the RAT stuff though

[03-Aug-22 11:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I got kind of obsessive about figuring out which RAT was the best. As a new player it was super overwhelming to have 12 recipes to make one thing, and it wasn't obvious which combinations of materials were allowed.


[04-Aug-22 02:50 AM] erklein#0000
10 NG available on Deimos if you still need it. 600/u


[04-Aug-22 07:19 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Is cost price the way the measure things though? I think the profit over time metric is better. Doesn’t matter if your input costs a bit more if the volume and profit you can produce on faster recipe is higher. I don’t think that’s often the case for HYF recipes, but it definitely makes the more expensive, but shorter FRM recipes optimal


[04-Aug-22 07:44 AM] rune_242#0000
Don't forget it also uses half as much area wich is also limited


[04-Aug-22 07:44 AM] rune_242#0000
Since hq upgrades get quite expensive


[04-Aug-22 08:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, fair point. My spreadsheet metric is profit per hour per unit of area, but fortunately I’m still not particularly space constrained yet so don’t have to be disciplined so far


[04-Aug-22 08:11 AM] rune_242#0000
the recipe for RAT requires: 
one part of protein
one part of carbs
and one part of VEG/NUT

Glad that I am not the only one who struggles to calculate time & area into profit calculations... There are so many ways to look at the input, output, and other factors. Although, I do get giddy when I find yet another way of calculating things, usually with a loud "A ha!"

If you're making CAF in your HYF and you run out of water, you can switch them to MUS 😄

@churavis @rune_242 I spam PG on QJ-650c, so I need carbon. May I book 500 C from you? I can pay 300 AIC/u, and in advance. Perhaps a 20 day order.


[04-Aug-22 06:18 PM] rune_242#0000
I'm sorry but I won't sell any of the C


[04-Aug-22 06:18 PM] churavis#0000
Is it  going to mess you up if we switch to a resource extraction CoGC program?


[04-Aug-22 06:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
No problem. You can switch to resource extraction. I also have extractors there, and actually 3 INC.


[04-Aug-22 06:18 PM] rune_242#0000
I consume about 50 C right now per day


[04-Aug-22 06:19 PM] rune_242#0000

[04-Aug-22 06:19 PM] rune_242#0000
I was also planning on switching it to resource extraction


[04-Aug-22 06:53 PM] churavis#0000
I haven't hammered out the details of my case plan or time-line yet but I'll probably have extra carbon to sell. I'm happy to promise my first born carbon but I wouldn't want to make a contract just yet.


[04-Aug-22 07:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Would be interesting to see what @archielvahr thinks of changing the COGC. Did we build it or the other randoms out there?


[04-Aug-22 07:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
What about QJ-149c?  It doesn't take anything special to build and already has an inactive COGC that could go INC.  It's two jumps from Harmonia and on the path between Demeter and ANT


[04-Aug-22 07:41 PM] churavis#0000
I think it actually was QJ-149c hat we were considering for an INC base


[04-Aug-22 07:43 PM] rune_242#0000
I would rather go to QJ-650c since it also has CLI and MGS


[04-Aug-22 07:45 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yep, you're right.  I was traveling yesterday, so only able to follow so much.


[04-Aug-22 07:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
We should figure out something to do with QJ-149c.  Just sitting there in a decent spot with all the makings of a useful planet


[04-Aug-22 09:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
QJ-650C is my MHL planet, so construction, manufacturing, or extraction would all be useful for me. Seems like consensus is on Pioneer-wide 10% bonus. Resource extraction wouldn't be bad, I think, since it benefits both the EXTs and INCs.


[04-Aug-22 09:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
It had no governor before I showed up, but the popi and cogc were well managed. [ANTS] melon164 had a big role in that


[05-Aug-22 01:12 AM] allocater#0000
QJ-149 is 1 jump off the path to demeter and furter away, QJ-650 ist exactly on the path and 2 jumps closer to demeter and same to ANT


[05-Aug-22 01:12 AM] allocater#0000
I will also sponsor 2 FRM bases on Demeter


[05-Aug-22 01:14 AM] allocater#0000
If anyone doesn't have a demeter base yet and a free permit (soon) you can teleport a base + 10 FRMs there. I should have it ready next week.


[05-Aug-22 01:38 AM] allocater#0000
once there is Carbon on 650, the H in 2 neighbor system can also make it a great plastics planet. The area is also TIO hub with our WCB competitor. Here a crude map:

Interesting.  When I was testing it with BLU last night, it sent me the other way through QJ-149 to ANT.  But it seems like your route works fine as well


[05-Aug-22 10:02 AM] jackinabox86#0000
And it is certainly a better route for our other planets in the region


[05-Aug-22 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
My water consumption on Harmonia has gone from 200/d to 600+ per day, so I'm looking for a larger supply. I've generally been buying it locally which mostly works well, but I'm open to shipping in full ships myself if someone has a dedicated water planet.

I realize I either have super low weight, high volume stuff (like HE) , or high weight, low volume shipments (like C) to move.

Especially with the HE, I'd like to fly out and pick it up less frequently.

Hi all, I was wondering if there was any interest in updating our corp rate on construction prefabs to offset inflation? I have 5 prefab plants running on Nike so I'm starting to build up stock that I can share with corp members as needed. However some of the current corp prices require me to operate at a loss and I don't think that any corp sale should require someone to lose money (unless there are unique circumstances/agreement). I should point out that I only run 2 con experts (the other 4 spots are needed for fuel experts) but I think there will be others that haven't earned 3+ con experts and may find themselves in a similar situation - such as those with newer bases on Nike. 
The attached screenshot shows the item, current corp rate, and profit/hour of construction prefabs from my spreadsheet. It includes corp discounts on all inputs, standard Nike fees, 2 con experts, and about 90% production line condition. I usually try to put my corp prices at around 20-30 AIC profit per hour to cover any hidden costs (fuel costs for transporting materials, building/ship repairs, unexpected input supply cost spikes, CX trips, etc.). Only the LTA price meets my usual minimum for corp price. 

I think the corp prices I usually set on my products are very reasonable but perhaps I'm the odd one out here so if we want to keep the prices as they are I'm fine with that but since they are pretty old and PrUn has seen a ton of inflation since they were established I thought I would at least bring it up 🙂 It's also understandable if these prices are designed to be below the profit line in an effort to help out newer players that have joined the corp?

BSE 650/u
BTA 600/u
LBH 1500/u
LSE 3900/u
LDE 3250/u
LTA 1300/u


[10-Aug-22 10:27 AM] churavis#0000
What inputs have gone up in price that you can't get in corp?


[10-Aug-22 10:32 AM] allocater#0000
Yes, I have been running bfabs at a loss for quite some time, but I didn't mind because money comes in from other sources. I also have been thinking for simplicity we should just set every bfab to 1000AIC and if the market goes lower than that, also great. 1000AIC still acts as a safety-net.


[10-Aug-22 10:34 AM] yjhasaday#0000
All inputs sourced from within corp or I produce myself. Prices in spreadsheet are as follows:
LST @ 35/u
AL @ 320/u
GL @ 130/u
PE @ 5/u
PG @ 20/u
NL @ 1800/u


[10-Aug-22 10:34 AM] jackinabox86#0000
perhaps we could give $100k to new members or something to help offset the cost of their first bfabs and then sell the rest at a level like YJ or Allocator is suggesting


[10-Aug-22 10:34 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Then they get a boost (after their 7 day trial), but we have a bit more rational pricing


[10-Aug-22 10:35 AM] allocater#0000
second starting capital sounds great


[10-Aug-22 10:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if they want a loan in addition to the grant, then usual Bank of OOG policies would apply


[10-Aug-22 10:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
new players also get the dividend to help with bfab prices


[10-Aug-22 10:37 AM] churavis#0000
Has the cost of your self made products or the in corp prices gone up?


[10-Aug-22 10:37 AM] allocater#0000
I buy AL at 400 and there were even 450 times, so BBH= 450+450+40+supplies and I sold for 800 😅


[10-Aug-22 10:39 AM] churavis#0000
I offered many times to sell AL for the corp price of 300


[10-Aug-22 10:51 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Before the Steam migration (when the corp bfab prices were set) prices were very different. The market rate for all bfabs was around 1000 or lower - there has been a similar trend amongst a lot of the inputs too so yes prices have increased


[10-Aug-22 10:53 AM] churavis#0000
But have corp prices increased?


[10-Aug-22 10:54 AM] yjhasaday#0000
No - that's what I'm suggesting. These prices existed well before then


[10-Aug-22 10:55 AM] churavis#0000
If corp prices have stayed the same and you only buy things in corp or make them yourself, then how can your costs increase since all your inputs haven't changed in price?


[10-Aug-22 10:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
The real benefit of the corp prices is knowing *where* to buy these products consistently, and the price to put in the contract. I also want the seller to profit, too, since that money is going into producing more corporate goods, anyway. I want them excited to sell to me again.

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Aug-22 11:00 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sorry, I misunderstood. Corp prices on some inputs have increased - the main one being AL. Before I had my own smelters on Deimos I used to consistently buy AL for around 270/u - now that I make my own I wonder how the hell people sold it to me for that price! 😅 I used to sell/make PE @ 3.5/u and I think PG was cheaper too


[10-Aug-22 11:04 AM] dersix#0000
from my position, a good supply of bfabs is helping growth a lot, but selling them at a loss should not happen, as this will not motivate people to go in this direction and leave all the supply pressure on the established ones (when I started doing INS I've increased the price form 55/u to 60/u, not to make a lot of money but just to offset cost). I think re-evaluating does not hurt (up/or down)


[10-Aug-22 11:14 AM] allocater#0000
and thanks for that, but I get AL from ~10 different sources and didn't want to move the price discrepancy from the market just on you.


[10-Aug-22 11:25 AM] rune_242#0000

[10-Aug-22 11:26 AM] rune_242#0000

[10-Aug-22 02:17 PM] exeler#0000
From a new player joining the corp's perspective, the dividend was more than enough to really accelerate my growth. 

I wouldn't mind setting in-corp prices to some ratio of whatever the current market value is. With perhaps inviduals who have more optimized setups able to offer a more stable/lower price. 

If we want to pin a price to something, why not work together to pin it publicly?


[10-Aug-22 02:17 PM] churavis#0000
We want corp prices to be consistent more than anything


[10-Aug-22 02:18 PM] churavis#0000
If we tie them to the market then they become as volatile as the market


[10-Aug-22 02:22 PM] exeler#0000
But then can't we try to contribute to a more stable market?

Like right now ALO is dirt cheap, but AL is kinda expensive. If unstable AL prices are something we want to avoid, why don't we contribute to setting a more stable price point?

If that works, we are able to then reap the benefits of being able to scoop up the materials we need at reasonably stable prices  from outside sources so we don't have to rely on corp members for everything.


[10-Aug-22 03:35 PM] insensless72#0000
The original reason for setting corp prices on bfabs, and C was to help quickly fuel new player growth and establish a solid foundation of players in corp. DLR and I were the primary contributors and were fine operating at a loss as we made money early on and were pretty much 100% vertical, further reducing the hit taken. Corp prices on goods are not and (in my opinion) should never be required, only voluntary. With that being said, bumping up minimums or even throwing out set costs for certain items is probably overdue as most of us are well within the established range at this point


[10-Aug-22 03:45 PM] insensless72#0000
Going off what YJ mentioned here, the prices were also set well before the Steam migration and the average price on market for BSE for example ranged from 650-800, 900max. We originally assumed that the prices would naturally fall back down to their average values, but that has not been the case. As @allocater mentioned, AL is still selling around 450ea where before it could easily be purchased on Deimos for 300 outside of corp. A new evaluation on corp prices is needed


[10-Aug-22 03:54 PM] churavis#0000
It should be noted that new players are generally in need of capital and cheap expansion supplies while older players have capital and expansion supplies but are generally in need of the basic inputs that feed higher tier production chains but  that area/permit limitations do not allow them to make themselves.

My understanding was that a main purpose of the corp was to facilitate old and new players giving each what the other needs. Lower corp prices and loans are a part of this.

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[10-Aug-22 03:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
one challenge is that corp prices for the basic inputs make it hard for a player producing to them to grow very quickly and provide additional input and overall supply to the corp.  That's very much mitigated by the subsidized bfabs, but I think I think we could help newer players by increasing the corp price for rats or PG, while also making it worthwhile for any player to produce bfabs or things like that.  I look at anything I do at corp price as basically hobbling myself for the good of the corp; that's justified because of the extreme generosity I've benefited from, but if we want supply and demand to work well in-corp, we should be reviewing the corp price on an occasional basis to account for costs/supplies/modest profit


[10-Aug-22 03:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
and if we want to subsidize newer players further with grants and loans, I think that's an excellent use of the bank.  No reason for capital to sit


[10-Aug-22 04:13 PM] insensless72#0000
Here in the next couple days I will reevaluate my corp costs for b - a fabs along with the other items I sell. I encourage others to do the same. Make sure that once you do, update the corporate sheet. If you notice others selling cheaper or higher than you take that into consideration. I also want to stress that this was a policy enacted to benefit new players so if youre not turning a profit in corp there is nothing preventing you selling on the CX. 

I will recreate and take over the bank of OOG role in case that new players are recruited or existing players need liquid capital for upkeep, expansions, etc

[10-Aug-22 05:24 PM] exeler#0000
I know when I started I felt kind of bad for taking advantage of all the really low corp prices and other perks, but was mostly unable to contribute back. I missed the memo on these benefits being designed specifically for new players, and knowing that now makes me feel a little better 😅


[10-Aug-22 05:30 PM] churavis#0000
If we need more H ZDLR could make an H base


[10-Aug-22 05:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I constructed my first few buildings by purchasing everything off the CX, and it was pretty slow going at the start. The discount BFABs were a huge bonus, and really kicked things into gear for me. I think raising bfab prices and offering back that income as loans is essentially equivalent, except that often people (including myself) are hesitant to "take on debt", since it adds anxiety about being able to pay it back.... whereas cheap bfabs are simply cheap bfabs. Wealthy OOG members opting into the banking system seems roughly equivalent to opting into our current "low corp price" system.


[10-Aug-22 05:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really have any sense of how much capital is idle in our distributed "bank account"


[10-Aug-22 05:40 PM] churavis#0000
At a certain point the limiting factor becomes not capital but managerial complexity


[10-Aug-22 06:14 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I get worried that if we have low prices, we’re dependent on a couple generous producers. That can limit supply and then leave us with a shortage when someone leaves, like the holes were filling after DLR’s departure. There’s always going to be a discount and perhaps the possibility of grants, but the way things are structured, a new player could never make a profit in construction joining this corp (which I was when I joined and had to pivot from)


[10-Aug-22 06:21 PM] churavis#0000
But you need to weigh that against the advantages of specialization due to expert stacking and COGC compounding efficiencies together. That specialization is only possible if one has a guaranteed market and the corp provides that.


[10-Aug-22 07:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think that’s only possible if you have guaranteed inputs or vertical integration, not guaranteed demand. Everything would be much better if we could do recurring custom contracts because you could sell me 1000 PE a week and I could stop thinking about it and focus on my thing. The COGC bonuses actually make it easier for one to compete in the true market because you can produce at scale faster and profit more through volume versus players who aren’t at a COGC. There is a guaranteed market for pretty much anything one would produce at any scale, and it’s the CX/global player base. Again, I think recurring contracts priced generously are a great thing to have in corp; I just think that those internal prices should reflect cost and be profitable so we give an incentive to people to participate. If we don’t price C and RATs decently, we’ll have a harder time getting new players to support longer-term ones through production of those mats.


[10-Aug-22 07:28 PM] churavis#0000
The faster your production the less you spend in consumables and repairs in addition to faster profits due to higher volumes. It also allows you to maximize the use of your land area, which is the biggest limiting factor mid to late game


[10-Aug-22 09:32 PM] exeler#0000
I kinda like the idea of boosting a new player by giving them a 20 day contract to produce X number of things on a new base and just paying a large amount. I think that would skip over the fear of debt a new member might have yet still allow the larger players to help a new player grow. 

For example, instead of "Just ask for a loan to get a new base", we can maybe try "Hey, I need a new C supplier and I'm willing to pay 300k for an order of 500C in 20d". 

New player accepts contract and uses money to start the base and produce the good. If it takes a little longer, the contract can always be extended easily.

[11-Aug-22 08:28 AM] yjhasaday#0000
These prices are better for me as well, I can also fill buy ads at these rate! And I think its still a considerable deal from current CX prices. 

I know it may be difficult for everyone to work with a fixed price but it certainly was convenient for those who needed prefabs to be able to post at the fixed rate and have it filled by whoever had stock. Shall we keep these prices as a corp standard rate?

Putting it out there if any other players want to help me colonize ZV-639D. It's a great N planet that has liquid N meaning you only need to rigs to extract! However, it is also gaseous (AEF) and cold (INS) so there is a definite greater cost to getting set up. I figure that as we expand our agriculture sectors, especially as we get more HYF up, there is going to be a greater need for NS to keep them all running. My personal plans on this planet are to have a base primarily of RIG and CHP, with a couple HYF and FP to simplify upkeep and logistics, so I'm only importing LST and H2O with some other basic supplies. Unfortunately, I haven't expanded much into construction yet so I have limited capacity in personally helping anyone else get started, but I do intend to construct and handle popi upkeep if/as more players arrive on planet. Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk

I'm very short of ICA now. It seems that the trade deficit in AI region is hard to avoid.😅


[16-Aug-22 11:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
Except prefabs, products with price advantage are usually very heavy things like mcg and al, which leads to insufficient value.


[17-Aug-22 12:21 AM] churavis#0000
ZDLR has ICA he can trade you for ACI


[17-Aug-22 12:32 AM] dersix#0000
I can in general exchange big quantities of currency, which would allow for an asymmetric trade, just let me know what you need/plan and we can find a solution :)


[17-Aug-22 01:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
I usually buy consumables from HRC and sell them, such as dw rat cof. If the price is right, I may buy something else. I used to sell bse there, but now I don't have enough for myself, so I can't sell it at all.


[17-Aug-22 01:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you have CIA that you don't use for the time being, you can trade it to me, and I'll pay it back with AIC or the goods bought from HRC.


[17-Aug-22 01:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
@churavis


[17-Aug-22 01:47 AM] allocater#0000
I sent you a AIC->ICA shipment for money conversion


[17-Aug-22 01:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, but I don't ship yet.


[17-Aug-22 01:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now I have collected all the materials for building a base in hep, and my ship is full of materials to go there. Then I will transport some supplies from ANT to hep, and then I can start work.😆


[17-Aug-22 09:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is there a convenient way or tool to manage consumables? The more complicated the population, the more troublesome the calculation, purchase and transportation are.


[17-Aug-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
PRUNner/sheets


[17-Aug-22 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or the workforce tab in view base can get you some basic numbers


[17-Aug-22 09:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
I've already used all these, and it seems that I need to adapt to the expanded business.


[17-Aug-22 09:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
With the help of Corp, the industrial chain and transportation are much more convenient.


[17-Aug-22 09:10 AM] domicius#0000
I use FIO. It tells you what's running low, and what to buy


[17-Aug-22 09:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
FIO's burndown is particularly good for managing consumables


[17-Aug-22 09:10 AM] domicius#0000
Does it for building materials too


[17-Aug-22 09:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is fio a stand-alone exe or a plug-in for the browser?


[17-Aug-22 09:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
You download a plugin, which pulls your data out of apex, then it shows up in the browser at https://fio.fnar.net/burnrate

When the ship was sent out for a long voyage, the supplementary materials were really torture, especially the raw materials contained such heavy things as C and al.

You are right, the initial capacity is insufficient, and it is necessary to get close between planets.

As a consequence, the prices on HCP, GRN and MAI went up too. This is also due to high prices on RAT. I suspect that the agricultural output in Antares area is highly insufficient now.


[21-Aug-22 10:08 AM] yang_mills#0000
More people should come to Demeter, really. Perhaps we should advertise our planet.

The high price cycle of carbon will not last long, because the threshold of this industry is too low.


[21-Aug-22 09:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main problem of C is transportation.


[21-Aug-22 09:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
If I have a 3000t transport ship, I can get the cx consumption of ai for two days in one transport.

Earthling played very conservatively, and has received every dividend since OOG started paying them out. There is about 6m cash which no doubt includes most of this dividend payout. I think this should be a nice recovery of wealth back to the corp bank

zDLR is in need of EPO for DEC for Phobos upkeep


[28-Aug-22 09:12 AM] dersix#0000
DEC for upkeep is incredibly costly


[28-Aug-22 09:14 AM] churavis#0000
More than HOG or MHP?


[28-Aug-22 09:15 AM] dersix#0000
more than both of them combined when I did the math for griff


[28-Aug-22 09:17 AM] dersix#0000
if you have a very cheap DEC/EPO source its comparable to HOG but still more expensive than MHP


[28-Aug-22 09:20 AM] allocater#0000
we are doing HOG and MHP anyway, no? So the competition is for the next cheapest?


[28-Aug-22 09:22 AM] churavis#0000
Also, does 1 unit of DEC increase the culture the same as 1 unit of HOG or 1 unit of MHP?


[28-Aug-22 10:20 AM] dersix#0000
I'm not calculating on single unit but cost for monthly supply


[28-Aug-22 10:21 AM] churavis#0000

Oh nice! I would buy it all if thats cool?? I can have a ship run to CX in the next day or so to pick it up. I'm assuming we still have to ship it to another planet before we can do a buy order - or do custom contracts allow company-company trading at CX now?

4 Welding plants have been running for 42 days, only doing MHL. So I've sold a fair bit too. I'm getting the impression that the supply is slowly outstripping demand. It seems like a few other people started up MHL production at the same time (probably during that coffee shortage when COF was 625/u)


[03-Sep-22 02:41 PM] allocater#0000
Maybe I should repair the water production chain 🤔

we could do an internal contest for the best haikus to submit (we should do more than one) and then we can also figure out who gets the stuff.  It's not like the winning haiku has to keep the spoils

@yang_mills do you still import SCR? I remember a while back you were talking about a supplier for SCR. I just wanted to make you aware that I've built a base on Avalon in the Hortus system and I've added SCR to my mining rotation so I'll start bringing it back with the TS/HE3 when I fly out next. 

Is there any corp interest/need for Sulfur? I could probably produce it on Deimos once I bring a shipment of SCR back - I'll use some to make SEA but I'm not sure if the chemical outputs are worth making? Maybe some people on @Griffonstone can inform me if they ever need to make BAC, BLE, or IND?

Also Avalon has MAG but I see no use for it so I haven't added it to my EXT rotation. However maybe we can use it in ship building supply chains or for planetary infrastructure upkeep? @Shipwright 

Let me know what everyone's thoughts are and I can adjust my mining accordingly! Cheers


[05-Sep-22 10:23 AM] allocater#0000
1 MAG builds 5 ships, so my amazing stockpile of 5 MAG will last for the next 25 ships, so probably end of the universe 😅


[05-Sep-22 10:45 AM] namthorn#0000
Only occasionally make BAC if we need some for AIR, requirement is pretty tiny though, the others I've never made


[05-Sep-22 10:45 AM] namthorn#0000
also the MAG thing is weird. It's an iron ore so I'd expect an alternate recipe for MAG -> FE


[05-Sep-22 10:47 AM] namthorn#0000
that or more magnet-related recipes, it's odd that we go straight to magnetic flooring and air filters instead of the more mundane uses of magnets


[05-Sep-22 12:30 PM] yang_mills#0000
I have 300+ units of SCR in reserve. I just put a buy orders 1 penny above MM buy and intercepted some SCR in this way.

[06-Sep-22 10:50 AM] balbar#0000
I did. I should be able to get most on Nike and a few things on other planets. Everything gets produced, but I don't know how much is available right now. Thats why I asked here😅


[06-Sep-22 10:57 AM] churavis#0000
INS and HSE are expensive, have you done an analysis to make sure the base will be worth it?


[06-Sep-22 11:00 AM] balbar#0000
I need an H2O-Price of 9 to break even according to PRUNner. That is with CX-prices for everything

We need the ability to sell a base! Inventory, buildings, the whole thing 😄


[06-Sep-22 03:01 PM] jackinabox86#0000
that would be a very nice package to sell.  I also wish someone could combine all consumables for 100 of a given workforce type, like PIOs, for 1 day into a specific package.  You could combine a given number of RAT, DW, and OVE and sell it as a chunk.  Would give another task for beginner manufacturers and simplify big bases for the long-time players.  One could still buy the constituent parts and probably save money, but I'd definitely pay for convenience!


[06-Sep-22 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I had the impression custom contracts would move that direction once they are beyond the "apply template" feature set.


[06-Sep-22 03:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
well yes, but you still have to ship everything together.  I want to buy a box

I'm going to make some NR so I can restock on ABH


[09-Sep-22 09:32 AM] churavis#0000
I'm producing it on Phobos and how much I produce depends on how consistent demand for NCS turns out to be. How often will you need it?


[09-Sep-22 03:07 PM] _bojidar#0000
Is it Possible to get some AEF from some1? 🙂

[09-Sep-22 04:05 PM] namthorn#0000
NR 220ish? NCS 20, and I can assist in turning into NR if you'll buy it.

had it sitting around for a while so not fussed either way


[09-Sep-22 04:08 PM] dersix#0000
I can provide EPO for the NR if needed, I'm looking overall at 2-3k NR


[09-Sep-22 04:08 PM] namthorn#0000
i have ample EPO production, should be np there. how many labs you got? we can divide up the NCS based on available capacity and go from there


[09-Sep-22 04:10 PM] dersix#0000

I think Nascent exploded the crop market, we should all switch to slow burning C, at 200 per crop it's not viable to turn 8 crops to 4 C


[13-Sep-22 11:48 PM] exeler#0000
What's the PG/EPO demand look like? I remember there being a discussion about it a while back about a base for it on Griffonstone. I also saw some notes about `QJ-650c`.

It looks like make enough C to fuel a 20 POL base, with maybe the occasional trip to the CX for some, so I'm not super worried about sourcing the C input. 

PRUNer estimated about 1.2k PG and EPO a day if I run a recurring order of 1 cycle each. Would there be enough buyers to consume that much including selling to the CX for any leftovers if there's enough to fill in-corp demand?


[14-Sep-22 02:07 AM] allocater#0000
PG can be either sold on the CX or turned into PSM/L. and sold. I would say the profits are good on the entire chain. EPO price is also high atm.


[14-Sep-22 06:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
PG is easy to spend, if we make textiles and consumables such as ove and nl.


[14-Sep-22 08:38 AM] exeler#0000
Sweet, any recommendations on Giffonstone vs QJ-650C?

I'll try and get the final layout planned and set up some orders for materials sometime today.


[14-Sep-22 09:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Probably Griffonstone. The Chemistry COGC is more useful for you. MG is lightweight and cheap and much easier to transport than C, so you don't gain much making PG on QJ-650C. I have loads of MGS/MG that I export from QJ-650c. It mostly ends up on the CX, but I'm happy to take it down and resell it cheaply for corp-mates


[14-Sep-22 11:58 AM] _bojidar#0000

I don't think anybody uses drones for popi, too expensive/badly balanced by the devs


[16-Sep-22 01:31 PM] allocater#0000
but we can do the math


[16-Sep-22 01:33 PM] jackinabox86#0000
seems like it's a good money maker to MMs?


[16-Sep-22 01:33 PM] churavis#0000
Repair drones are the only upgrade that increases endurance without increasing repair costs


[16-Sep-22 06:06 PM] exeler#0000
Finding a way to optimize the supply chain for them enough to make them viable could be a fun goal


[16-Sep-22 06:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wonder if the damage reduction is less than the added fuel cost from the additional mass


[16-Sep-22 06:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
They’ve done a lot of drone analysis and it sounds like they’re never cost effective. I’m interested in the production chain as a challenge someday, but more for profit than usage


[16-Sep-22 06:57 PM] erklein#0000
I'm interested in it, less for profit and more because I feel like at least ANT with the electronics boost should be the one place in the universe they're available


[16-Sep-22 11:00 PM] allocater#0000
ANT produces a lot of drones, just the ones that sell to MM for profit


[17-Sep-22 12:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000
@rune_242 had some the other day


[17-Sep-22 12:11 PM] churavis#0000
Where and how much?


[17-Sep-22 12:38 PM] churavis#0000
I've got 640 and zDLR has 1242 on Nike, he also makes more than 200 a day there, or the full 2k on Heph


[17-Sep-22 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
When do you need it? We could probably have the full amount in less than a day


[17-Sep-22 12:44 PM] churavis#0000
I'll give DLR my stock and he'll be able to fulfill the 2k in about 18h


[19-Sep-22 01:30 PM] allocater#0000

@allocater or @yang_mills are the two possibilities


[20-Sep-22 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
Do we recruit people from Hortus area, especially those who started in Promiter?


[20-Sep-22 09:15 PM] churavis#0000
I would advise against it, almost all corp bases are in Antares and we couldn't support or receive support from them due to distance and currency issues


[20-Sep-22 09:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
I specifically refer to the person who plans to move to Antares. If all his bases are in Hortus, I suggest not to recruit either.


[20-Sep-22 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
Money is not a problem. Hortus's specialty is easy to sell in Antares, and they can easily get enough AIC.


[20-Sep-22 09:17 PM] balbar#0000
Promitor is even slightly closer to ANT than Etherwind


[20-Sep-22 09:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
RAT and C can be easily transported through WCB upgrade. If Promitor is not full, I want to build a base there.


[20-Sep-22 09:19 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If someone is moving to ANT and going to make participating in the corp a priority, I don’t have a real issue with it, but I also don’t want members that aren’t really focused on where we’re focused. Having bases wherever is cool, I just want them to be able to interact/trade with us.


[20-Sep-22 09:21 PM] churavis#0000
It's hard to move your first base as you can't get any MATs out of the command module and for a planet that's full like promitor you will feel like you don't want to move being that you won't be able to come back later


[20-Sep-22 09:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
So I think their biggest advantage is that they can keep that base, and then build a new base in Antares, and slowly move to Antares.


[20-Sep-22 09:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
Even if they sell crops, C and consumables to Corp in promiter or avalon, I think it helps a lot. I always feel that the crops of Antares are not enough.


[20-Sep-22 09:24 PM] churavis#0000
In any case, its up to @yjhasaday. He has a plan for specifically how many recruits we want and from where. Don't promise anyone anything until he says so.

{Reactions}
👌 

[20-Sep-22 09:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
From the perspective of Antares, if we can get more and cheaper consumables, crops, and C from Hortus, the problem of population reduction caused by the meager profit of new players can be alleviated. Especially Moria is buying from there.


[20-Sep-22 09:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
And the output of DW and water is very large, which I think is easier to solve.


[21-Sep-22 01:23 AM] yjhasaday#0000
@yuen8241 I don't think it's a great idea to start inviting players from outside of Antares space. Moving an entire operation can be very tedious, time consuming, and high effort. One of our main goals with recruitment is to make our member's experiences easy and enjoyable, not demand them to start their whole company from scratch far from the region that they've been getting comfortable in. We have a good group here that is pretty committed to PrUn but not everyone is like us. I fear that requiring relocation from newer players is a recipe for poor player retention. 

However, if you know this person and they are already interested in relocating then send me their company info and lets start a conversation - maybe we can make an exception if the situation is right? Especially if they are into farming!

I can do most things from it. The key is to set up a handful of tiles for what you need. For example I have CONTD in a trading tile along with the CX and LMs, so sending contracts is easy. I also have an inventory tile, production tile, flt, etc. if you don’t take the time to put links to what you need, it’s unusable

I use the mobile UI a fair bit when I'm away. 

Like @jackinabox86 said, you have to set up the different stacks for what you want to do. It's similar to the main UI in that way where you have to set up different screens for the things you need. 

The more I use it the more comfortable it becomes.


[21-Sep-22 09:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
The only thing that is damn near unusable is the slider for fuel usage on a ship.  Sending ships is a major PITA

this 

[21-Sep-22 09:20 AM] exeler#0000
A truer statement has never been said lol. I usually just accept the default or tap on the slider instead of trying to use it like a slider.


[21-Sep-22 09:27 AM] churavis#0000
I've discovered that if you hold it down you can move your finger down far enough to see the slider while you move your finger, that helps a lot


[21-Sep-22 09:47 AM] seraphx2#0000
the annoying thing is that you can't easily rearrange buffers as you figure out more efficient ways to do things.


[21-Sep-22 10:54 AM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, you have to delete and readd; I wish you could reorder.  I just ignore the buffer stack though, unless I'm deleting 100+ buffers after using it for weeks


[21-Sep-22 11:08 AM] churavis#0000
I have to empty out the buffer stack every so often, otherwise it will always freeze up whenever I accidentally hit the stack button in an unassigned buffer.

[21-Sep-22 12:40 PM] _bojidar#0000
deimos is ok too


[22-Sep-22 01:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
The latest price of BDE is 1200 AIC per unit.


[22-Sep-22 01:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can accept CIS, but I am out of BDE now.


[22-Sep-22 01:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
Few people in Antares use NCC.


[22-Sep-22 01:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
The price of building materials has risen sharply these days. Moreover, a wave of new members has consumed a lot of building materials.


[22-Sep-22 01:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
I suggest you build a base on Nike and Deimos to produce Al and prefabricated parts. We are short of both. The shortage of C has been basically solved.


[22-Sep-22 01:58 AM] _bojidar#0000
i will..but then again need to buy some first 🙂

I've got my base on Griff up and running, and I find I need a lot of BER and LIO. So two questions: Does anyone mine those ores, and have extra they can regularly supply? Or if I set up a dedicated BER or LIO mining planet, would anyone want some?


[23-Sep-22 02:05 PM] churavis#0000
Namthorn has an LI base on KI-439B, which has both LIO and HAL

Ooh, I'm probably going to be looking for a HAL supplier sometime soon


[23-Sep-22 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mine a tiny bit of HAL on griffonstone to cover my own purposes, seems like a good place to make LI for that reason


[23-Sep-22 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
If I get enough LIO, I can probably sell excess LI also


[23-Sep-22 03:06 PM] churavis#0000
Send your contracts to ZDLR, he always has tons of HAL

It looks like Yang's biggest contributions that we will now need to replace are the 2 EDM on Phobos, the HWP on Deimos as well as FP and BMP in various locations, am I missing anything?


[26-Sep-22 10:22 PM] churavis#0000
I have just built two EDM on Phobos as I was planning on that anyways.


[26-Sep-22 10:24 PM] churavis#0000
I can do the HWP on Deimos if given a few days to upgrade my HQ, although I'll definitely need help with more AL and HE as my current capacity is tapped out providing for my 9 PP2 on Nike.


[26-Sep-22 10:27 PM] churavis#0000
I am running for Governor of Phobos but will need help with upkeep previously provided by Yang, especially FOD, DEC, OFF and DW


[26-Sep-22 10:43 PM] seraphx2#0000
well, im building up some AL on Deimos. i'll have 42 per day starting out in the next few days once i get all my inputs there. im not sure if allocater was wanting a constant supply or not. i would assume to some degree yes, that he would need more than just the first 1000 units to offset the 400k loan he gave me. and that he would want to keep producing. maybe with Yang leaving, if there is capacity, i can supply allocater with his daily allotment have the rest be distributable to other needs as well? will ahve to talk to him more about that tomorrow.

But im only at 379/500 for the base. can always add a little bit more to capacity.
and i'd help with DW but my Harmonia base is supplying itself and my Deimos base now and im tapped there for the time being unless i get a chance to expand my base on Harmonia. im at 500 capacity


[26-Sep-22 10:51 PM] exeler#0000
In a few days my base on Griffonstone should be making some DEC, how many do we need?


[26-Sep-22 10:52 PM] exeler#0000
I've got more HE than I know what to do with. Send me a contract for as much as you need whenever you need it. 

If you start using it all, I'll expand the HE base. There is plenty of room left on that base to expand.


[26-Sep-22 10:54 PM] exeler#0000
Alternatively, I was planning on building a metallurgy base with WEL, FS, and HWP sometime in the future. I can expedite that and make it my next base expansion.

I've got all the materials I need for my next HQ upgrade already on the way to my HQ, so I should be able to set this up as soon as I've got the capital for it.


[26-Sep-22 10:56 PM] exeler#0000
I should be able to make enough metals and HE to keep that base running myself, which is why I was planning on starting the base. Seems like the next natural progression step.


[27-Sep-22 01:48 AM] allocater#0000
2 DEC per day


[27-Sep-22 03:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
Nike and Griffinstone  are short of technicians. Phobos are short of Engineers.


[27-Sep-22 03:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
What is the corresponding infrastructure of technicians?


[27-Sep-22 09:14 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I think when he said 1000 units to pay the loan, he meant it.  He can confirm, but I think your debt is repaid then.  All of us will buy AL though, so get as big as you can as fast as you can!


[27-Sep-22 09:16 AM] seraphx2#0000
yeah. he confirmed last night in DM that he only wants the 1k. so supply will be open after that.


[27-Sep-22 09:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
@churavis what quantities of the inputs do you need per week or whatever the cycle length is.  I find it a lot easier to determine if I can help with something if I know the volume needed


[27-Sep-22 09:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
also, happy to contribute cash to buy things.  I don't really want to build a base for DW, but I can pay for it


[27-Sep-22 12:35 PM] churavis#0000
What building MATs are you lacking? I'd be glad to sell them to you with a long payment tail if it means getting the HWP up and running faster, it looks like we're going to need it


[27-Sep-22 03:45 PM] exeler#0000
All of them 😅

I don't make any building mats myself, so I don't keep them on hand. 

I'll try and get a plan together and see exactly what I need. How many HWP would it take to satisfy the needs we have? Do we just need one?


[27-Sep-22 03:47 PM] churavis#0000
According to the sheet, Yang just had one in addition to Insensless' HWP so I'd recommend just starting with one yourself to see whether it fills demand and has enough inputs.


[27-Sep-22 03:48 PM] churavis#0000
You'll want to build plenty of smelters to provide inputs as well


[27-Sep-22 03:53 PM] exeler#0000
My Deimos base has many SME as will fit in a 500 area base, so I definitely have that covered. Especially if we only need one HWP.


[27-Sep-22 06:28 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I had an HWP for a bit and it just cranked out hull plates. Like 12 a day. You might want two up front to help with the backlog, or someone else could do one temporarily. I could probably do it in a couple days when I’m done with the TIO I have and am therefore producing enough AL


[27-Sep-22 10:13 PM] seraphx2#0000
@churavis how much AL are you gonna be short per day?


[27-Sep-22 10:14 PM] churavis#0000
Probably more than you can produce in one base


[27-Sep-22 10:14 PM] seraphx2#0000

[27-Sep-22 10:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
Recently, the profit margin of al smelting is relatively low, but the demand of corp is very large. That's why interest-free loans are given to new players. This is a win-win cooperation.

I've been chatting with a few other members, and I'm stepping up to make some higher tier consumables. Orchard products in particular. Insenseless had the only ORC in corp, and I'm planning on adding two to Demeter- where water is plentiful, Agri experts are already at 5/5, and high fertility will help output. I'll need 16 ASE and 8 ATA. If anyone has some available, let me know.. otherwise I'll hit up Pokter again. (I have the liquid cash to pay off my last Afab loan, so I am ready for another 😄 )

So, I don't have a base on Deimos, and I have a few extra base permits. I can take on ASMs / HWP / SKF there if we can be sure we have the materials to feed them. First I wanna set up my orchards on demeter and I'll need to chase down 16 ASE and 8 ATA.


[30-Sep-22 04:50 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I was thinking about doing more ASMs, but given my 8 PP2 on Nike and 4 PP1, I'm definitely down on my AL supply and losing more Deimos space would be tough, even though I'm doing a new full base a A2b.  I can definitely do my one ASM and may be able to do another


[30-Sep-22 04:50 PM] jackinabox86#0000

Also, if we're looking for tasks, we need someone to do R-Fabs/A-Fabs now that our usual producers (Insensless and Pokter) are leaving.  It's on my medium term outlook, but trying to get the shipbuilding stuff settled first.  If anyone else is interested, there'll be demand!


[30-Sep-22 09:54 PM] churavis#0000
I am uniquely positioned to produce Rfabs and Afabs and will be setting that up shortly. It would be a good idea to have another as well, however

Personally, I suggest that the materials needed for shipbuilding should be directly given to the person in charge of shipbuilding, which are produced at the internal price.


[01-Oct-22 08:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
I mainly need materials for manufacturing ins and frabs, and my ar and THF reserves are enough for me to produce enough ins to build a base. Of course, if no one wants it, I'm happy to ask for some more to save for the needs of new members in the future. Besides, yang and pokter are our H producers, and YJ14 is on vacation , so if no one wants it, I want to stock up H to produce PE.


[01-Oct-22 08:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
If the production of H and fuel of Corp cannot be maintained, I will consider joining the industry of H producer and producing H+AR at the same time.


[01-Oct-22 08:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Allocater should definitely get the ship parts. Fuel supply will be fine, but we may need someone to do H along with YJ


[01-Oct-22 09:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think the biggest trouble is that we lost the VCB boat, and my LCB needs to transport water. It is not very efficient to transport H. Of course, I can ask Allocater to transport water for me.


[01-Oct-22 09:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
AEF has more than 100 demands. It seems that no one in our house produces NE?


[01-Oct-22 09:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
Personally, I suggest adding ship information to the Corp form, so that we can judge whether the transportation capacity of crops and H is sufficient.


[01-Oct-22 10:03 AM] dersix#0000

Oh wow PE has fallen back to 5 on the CX


[02-Oct-22 01:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
So I'm going to make other products instead.


[02-Oct-22 01:24 AM] allocater#0000
4-5 is still good


[02-Oct-22 01:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to build a base in griffonstone, which will cost a lot of Rrab, but my excess C can be digested by PG. Just do some MCG these days for expansion and reserve at Heph.


[02-Oct-22 01:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
I found that the number of SME is not enough. Maybe we can find a planet outside deimos to deal with SMEs.


[02-Oct-22 01:33 AM] allocater#0000
some members have no deimos base yet and could build one


[02-Oct-22 01:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
The goods that deimos SME needs to import from the outside are mainly C, and the gross tonnage is still very small compared with BMP, which I think is quite suitable for newcomers.


[02-Oct-22 01:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
A WCB specially transporting C+ALO from nascent to deimos can basically meet the needs of many members.


[02-Oct-22 01:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now I calculate that my own C demand can be met by Harmonia alone, so I won't expand to nascent for the time being.


[02-Oct-22 02:03 AM] balbar#0000
I don't have a deimos base yet. I can set up a SME-base on Deimos if we need more of those. I can source ALO and O locally and "only" need C, right? I do have some spare cash right now due to insensless leaving

[02-Oct-22 02:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, you can set up COL and EXT locally. You only need to enter FLX, C and consumables.

I found that several people in our Corp are short of AL. If you smelt, we can directly sell you C and then buy your Al at deimos, which can save your capacity.

I think we should revisit the corp price for it. Make it worthwhile to smelt. Maybe 375 a unit?


[02-Oct-22 09:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
400AIC is acceptable to me, which can give SME producers more profits to encourage production.


[02-Oct-22 09:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
Sponsorship or subsidy within Corp should be given priority to farmers, followed by metallurgical industry. With enough basic products, shipbuilding can circulate positively.

INS is not a problem


[02-Oct-22 10:50 AM] balbar#0000

I'm about to close a large deal (for me) that will allow me to expand my bases quite a bit. What is the protocol for purchasing things from the corp? Do I just look at the price spreadsheet and send contracts directly?


[05-Oct-22 02:29 AM] balbar#0000
you can also put the buy ads on the local markets and maybe post a notice in the discord for the respective planet


[05-Oct-22 02:29 AM] dehzhas#0000
Perfect, thanks


[05-Oct-22 02:45 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, one time purchases are easier as LM ad, repeated same contracts are easier as custom contracts


[05-Oct-22 02:46 AM] allocater#0000
also when multiple partners are possible LM ads are better


[05-Oct-22 07:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also, I don't think we have it written down anywhere, but the rule of thumb is not to directly re-sell anything purchased at a corp discount. Although you could certainly worth that out with people

if you're going to use a permit, you should get fairly compensated


[06-Oct-22 03:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
you producing ALO would allow me to drop 6 extractors and do several more SMEs


[06-Oct-22 03:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
I can actually just drop most if not all the SMEs and mostly do extraction.


[06-Oct-22 03:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
I was actually thinking of doing a base on Nascent for ALO extraction because my Deimos base is already built out and retooling it effectively would be wasteful at the moment.

That might be good as you could stack experts

But I can get constant supply for ALO and I think it is easier to ship than AL.

I'm also going to be buying large amounts of ALO regularly. 

Currently I just use public LM ads on Deimos or get it on the CX, but if you're ever in a position of needing to find a buyer for ALO throw a contract my way. I like to stockpile my inputs so I'll basically always be buying.


[06-Oct-22 07:38 PM] dehzhas#0000
ok, in that case, I will just make an ALO base and assume that most of it will sell internally. I can dump any extra on the market in the worst case.

True, but most prices in the sheet list at 50/u for RAT and DW


[09-Oct-22 03:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
I usually buy RAT at HRT at 65/U. However, the company's prices are very favorable. If you buy fabs to build a base, you can save more than 100k, which is basically the welfare price.🤩


[09-Oct-22 03:35 AM] dehzhas#0000
My problem right now is that I don't produce enough RAT inputs myself, so I have to pay through the nose for them, which just kills my margins. Working on solving that. Once I do, selling RAT for 50/u to the corp in exchange for bfabs at low prices is an excellent trade IMO


[09-Oct-22 07:47 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Don’t worry. Take your time. You’re definitely contributing, so don’t feel bad about charging what you need to. No one, particularly newer players, should be selling at a loss

melon164 and I were both eyeballing WU-882h


[10-Oct-22 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
because it also contains LES as an added bonus.


[10-Oct-22 12:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
ZV-896f is tempting due to the closeness to ANT, but the concentration is so low it's a terrible return


[10-Oct-22 12:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
anything else is quite far away. There are some candidates near other exchanges, particularly near Arclight


[10-Oct-22 12:32 PM] churavis#0000
One of you could put a temporary base on ZV-896f long enough to get the F you need to make a more permanent base on WU-882h


[10-Oct-22 12:33 PM] rune_242#0000
how about PD-754f?


[10-Oct-22 12:34 PM] rune_242#0000
you need INS and AEF


[10-Oct-22 12:35 PM] rune_242#0000
the concentration is almost double WU-882h


[10-Oct-22 12:42 PM] churavis#0000
Also, Moria station has some F, it's horrendously expensive but it's enough to get you started


[10-Oct-22 12:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeaaaah thought about that.


[10-Oct-22 12:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
PD-754f is an option - 11 jumps out, empty planet. AM-528f is the only one that's not cold. it's 3 jumps from arclight, but 18 from ant. kind of poor efficiency.


[10-Oct-22 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
UV-234g was one I liked. Very rich 3 jumps from benten, 5 from moria. Has one person on it, NorseFTX


[10-Oct-22 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
no replies to messages yet


[10-Oct-22 12:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
WC-702j 35 jumps away.. but 3 from hubur. Can I make a base exclusively with shipping contracts? 😄


[10-Oct-22 01:08 PM] churavis#0000
I wouldn't rely on inter cx shipping contracts, they're always in demand from traders and most players that have the ability to ship between CXs prefer to just trade themselves and keep all the profit.


[10-Oct-22 01:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well melon164 bought some of the super expensive Moria F to make BL for WU-882h


[10-Oct-22 01:25 PM] churavis#0000
Then maybe you can just buy from him when he produces more?


[10-Oct-22 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup


[10-Oct-22 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
as fun as it was to entertain the idea of being the only F producer in the universe


[10-Oct-22 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
probably more effective to buy from him


[10-Oct-22 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
How much F would you even need on a regular basis?


[10-Oct-22 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Really not a lot. like 5 a week?


[10-Oct-22 02:42 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, it makes more sense to buy it from him and I'm sure he'll be glad for the business on such a low velocity product


[10-Oct-22 02:44 PM] churavis#0000
Does anyone else have their eye on a high gravity planet?


[11-Oct-22 02:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
@jackinabox86 I'm sending @dehzhas the 200k grant now, I have set aside funds for that

I just got it from @allocater - as much as I would love to double my grant money 🤣 ... there are probably other things to do with it


[11-Oct-22 02:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hah, okay I guess you can talk me out of it


[11-Oct-22 02:14 PM] churavis#0000
Allocater is the bank and has oodles of money


[11-Oct-22 02:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe I can use it to subsidize someone's rfab production


[11-Oct-22 04:01 PM] _bojidar#0000
Any1 have KOM stocked?


[11-Oct-22 04:02 PM] churavis#0000
Thumper said he was going to set up a large KOM operation on Norwick but I don't know if that's happened yet.


[11-Oct-22 04:14 PM] exeler#0000
I'd also love to buy KOM regularly.


[11-Oct-22 08:33 PM] erklein#0000
I have about 100 excess KOM on Deimos if anyone needs it. I also have plans to expand my production soon from Norwick as I don't produce enough excess past my own needs to offer it regularly to the corp


[11-Oct-22 08:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send you a contract for 50 KOM


[11-Oct-22 09:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
I want the rest of KOM.


[12-Oct-22 01:57 AM] thummper#0000
Do we have AMM on QJ-382G? 🧀


[12-Oct-22 02:34 AM] _bojidar#0000
I want to expand in Ant area more but I  need 1 more ship first and later on glass one for same area


[12-Oct-22 02:35 AM] _bojidar#0000
I will expand 2 more planets but can't handle all as it is


[12-Oct-22 06:20 AM] jackinabox86#0000
YJ sells some from there


[12-Oct-22 09:22 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Current stock is 465, I will accept your ad once I have the 550 you requested 🙂 should be about 36 hours from now


[12-Oct-22 09:23 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Actually I accepted it now, I'll fill when I can


[12-Oct-22 09:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Who are our major suppliers of PG and EPO now? I used to go to DLR and Pokter for large amounts of those. @Griffonstone


[12-Oct-22 10:06 AM] rune_242#0000
didn't I use to buy PG from you?


[12-Oct-22 10:43 AM] allocater#0000
I am producing PG and EPO on Griff, but it will probably be not enough


[12-Oct-22 12:14 PM] thummper#0000
Thanks xoxox


[12-Oct-22 12:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I produce some, but use a fair bit of it.  Rune and I are planning on building on KI-840c, where I will do PG and some EPO


[12-Oct-22 01:37 PM] rune_242#0000
I will also do PG and EPO I'll use it all myself though
At least that's less demand in corp


[12-Oct-22 01:38 PM] allocater#0000
are there any planets in the southern rim that would be awesome if they were developed?


[12-Oct-22 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm flying out to GK-115c to buy LIO. I wouldn't say it should be developed though, heh


[12-Oct-22 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
melon164 is making an F base on WU-882h. But I think his one base will probably cover the needs in ANT for F. It's a relatively useful planet because it also has LES


[12-Oct-22 05:09 PM] exeler#0000
I make these on griff. 500 area base dedicated entirely to PG/EPO/DEC production.


[12-Oct-22 06:42 PM] churavis#0000
What about IY-816D? It has lots of water and is on the way to Demeter. It would be great for supplying Demeter, Norwick and Harmonia with water. A full base could produce 434.45 H20 per day. It would only require SEA and INS.


[12-Oct-22 08:40 PM] yjhasaday#0000
haha couldn't have been me, I haven't made a single PG myself lol


[12-Oct-22 08:41 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Nice, if I send a ship out in a few days will you have some stock to sell?


[13-Oct-22 01:47 AM] rune_242#0000
it was Namthorn🤦‍♂️


[13-Oct-22 10:21 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Tried to fill but it you need space - do you have a big enough warehouse?


[13-Oct-22 11:12 AM] allocater#0000
does ANT have a N problem?


[13-Oct-22 11:15 AM] rune_242#0000
not for me,
I buy all my N from @erklein 
bought 2k last week


[13-Oct-22 11:15 AM] rune_242#0000

[13-Oct-22 02:06 PM] erklein#0000
I noticed someone has been scalping it recently. I think I’m producing around 90 excess a day with the next 1000 going to Archiel. I usually have a stockpile on Heph if anyone needs it, and can scale up production if it becomes necessary


[13-Oct-22 02:08 PM] churavis#0000
I could use some N after Archiel

[13-Oct-22 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use about 125/day making nutrient solution. But I fallback to flux to keep them busy when I run out.


[13-Oct-22 02:13 PM] rune_242#0000
who exactly?


[13-Oct-22 02:13 PM] rune_242#0000
wow Erix you have a triple A rating👌


[13-Oct-22 02:16 PM] erklein#0000
It’s Avalon Illuminate. I think for the past couple of weeks, he’s had the lowest price listed around 160/u. When I put up a couple hundred at 120/u on the market, he immediately snapped it up and reposted it


[13-Oct-22 02:18 PM] churavis#0000
Scalping has been discussed and it mostly means that you get paid immediately and he takes the time cost of the capital stored in that N and the risk that the market goes down before he can sell it.


[13-Oct-22 02:19 PM] rune_242#0000
if erix would produce more it wouldn't be worth it anymore right?


[13-Oct-22 02:19 PM] churavis#0000
If you do want to screw him over you could expand your N production and then dump it on the market so that he can't buy it all up and is never able to sell what he's already bought, that's what we did when someone tried to scalp all our MCG.

[13-Oct-22 02:20 PM] rune_242#0000
do you need anything to expand your production?


[13-Oct-22 02:20 PM] rune_242#0000
or are you already on max building space?


[13-Oct-22 02:20 PM] allocater#0000
I could also use another 1000 N for SEN


[13-Oct-22 02:20 PM] rune_242#0000
I have 140 NE that could go into AEF


[13-Oct-22 02:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have an N base in MOR space that I just need to expand to produce more. Fully maxed, I can produce 2k of N a day. I only have 1 rig there at the moment, but can pretty easily expand it once I get my funds. I don't have the shipping capacity to get 2k/day of N off the planet, but I can start sending thousands a week from ANT to MOR if we really want volume here.


[13-Oct-22 02:27 PM] dehzhas#0000
2k of N per day at 120/u would be pretty much impossible for him to scalp at that rate 🤣  unless he make $240k/day

{Reactions}
😆 

[13-Oct-22 03:32 PM] erklein#0000
I should be good for materials for expansion. My limit was just prioritizing other planets, and limited capacity in shipping/limited demand


[13-Oct-22 08:18 PM] yjhasaday#0000
no worries! Let me know when you're ready


[14-Oct-22 02:02 AM] rune_242#0000
what planet is that?


[14-Oct-22 02:03 AM] dehzhas#0000
WB-947h


[14-Oct-22 02:05 AM] rune_242#0000
about the BL is that just for construction or do you need it constantly like a consumable?


[14-Oct-22 02:05 AM] dehzhas#0000
Construction and I believe upkeep


[14-Oct-22 02:06 AM] dehzhas#0000
yep, repair costs include 1 BL


[14-Oct-22 02:06 AM] dehzhas#0000
It's a nasty planet

{Reactions}
🤢 

[14-Oct-22 02:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
If I can get F, I can produce INS, HSE and BL. However, our production capacity is far from that of pokter.


[14-Oct-22 02:14 AM] allocater#0000
you can let it decay to 33% and it will stay there permanently. 3 times consumable costs but no more construction costs


[14-Oct-22 02:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you can get F, BL is not expensive at all. I suspect that an F producer has stopped playing.


[14-Oct-22 02:58 AM] thummper#0000
ship has arrived thanks


[14-Oct-22 09:51 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I was kind of fearing this might happen, unfortunately it still doesn't work - I think you need to have enough WAR space for the entire shipment. But it will work if I send you a sell contract so I just sent you one (and requested termination of the other one). If it doesn't give you your payment back let me know and we'll set up a contract for the refund

[14-Oct-22 01:09 PM] _bojidar#0000
any RAT/DW stocks?


[14-Oct-22 01:12 PM] dehzhas#0000
Depends on where, but if it is an emergency, I might be able to help a little. My Fri-Sat deliveries use all of my production, but I have some flexibility to sell you some at CX prices and repurchase at CX to fill my other orders if you need some in a hurry.


[14-Oct-22 01:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
If it is a very small amount, I might be able to sell you some at corp prices to hold you over until resupply


[14-Oct-22 01:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
I should have plenty of availability on Sunday to provide a good bit.


[14-Oct-22 01:16 PM] dehzhas#0000
if @allocater is willing to extend his contract by a day or two, I can provide you a lot more.


[14-Oct-22 01:19 PM] dehzhas#0000
how much you need?


[14-Oct-22 01:20 PM] dehzhas#0000

is there any more need for Afabs?


[15-Oct-22 10:48 AM] churavis#0000
Being that my goal is to upgrade my HQ as much as possible, there will be an insatiable need for Afabs


[15-Oct-22 10:49 AM] rune_242#0000
I will build 2 in a couple days so I can upgrade my HQ
however this isn't urgent so if they are needed elsewhere that's fine for me


[15-Oct-22 10:49 AM] churavis#0000
For right now though, there seems to be a higher deficit of PP3 capacity


[15-Oct-22 10:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, rfabs have been short. I had to buy a few on the cx


[15-Oct-22 10:51 AM] rune_242#0000
can't make those at the moment because I don't have EPO


[15-Oct-22 10:51 AM] rune_242#0000
oh wow I actually have some stock of Rfabs


[15-Oct-22 10:51 AM] rune_242#0000

ah well not at the moment, but I'll hit you up 😄


[15-Oct-22 10:52 AM] rune_242#0000
I have 39 RBH and 28 RSE


[15-Oct-22 10:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I would buy many Afabs as well


[15-Oct-22 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
actually my last permit will be expanding my labs on griff, so I'll take 12 RBH and 8 RSEs for my next permit.


[15-Oct-22 10:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don’t need rfabs today, but I often do. The more supply the better of both


[15-Oct-22 10:54 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You should join me on electronica and get a 500 area base


[15-Oct-22 10:54 AM] rune_242#0000
my plan was to take down my BMP's and build them on hephaestus to make room for 2 PP4's
if I do this I'll have 1 space left on nike

ah it's so far to fly though!


[15-Oct-22 11:01 AM] churavis#0000
I'm going to make a POL base on Antares II d, which will be a bit expensive to construct but the logistics will be so much easier and I'll save money on shipping


[15-Oct-22 11:10 AM] jackinabox86#0000
It’s a great idea and maybe I’ll join you one day, but losing Pokter’s hse has soured me on those bases. I hope Yuen gets that figured out


[15-Oct-22 11:14 AM] churavis#0000
Yeah, that guy was crazy, he apparently had 20 PP3. I can't imagine how much of a beast it was to get all the inputs for those


[15-Oct-22 11:14 AM] churavis#0000
If we can get a good source of TCS in the corp then I could make more HSE


[15-Oct-22 11:48 AM] balbar#0000
I have a TNP on griffonstone, so I can supply at least a littel if necessary


[15-Oct-22 11:49 AM] churavis#0000

[15-Oct-22 12:01 PM] churavis#0000
4k/u is fine with me. Ultimately they'll be needed on Nike but I ship stuff there from Deimos, ANT and Heph all the time so just send me a contract whenever you have more on any of those planets


[15-Oct-22 12:02 PM] balbar#0000
most of my griffon stuff is going to deimos, so if you are fine with shipping it from there i will send you contracts to pick it up on deimos for 4k/u

[15-Oct-22 12:14 PM] balbar#0000
As I said, i have (1) TNP on Griffon, not sure if that really needs a dedicated base. On the other hand both Yuen and Namrhorn have a TNP on Griffon...


[15-Oct-22 12:15 PM] balbar#0000
Right. I'll sell anything I don't use myself on the CX. Just give me a notice, I can probably provide any amount you need in a few days at most. currently at 127/day 🙂

7k  Send me the contract directly.


[15-Oct-22 08:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
I suggest you buy TCS directly from me at the price of 4000, because my LSE is not enough.😅


[15-Oct-22 08:34 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If you need LSE, I can sell those


[15-Oct-22 08:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
That's good, too. We can make a deal. Anyway, PG and AL are too short.

[17-Oct-22 11:31 AM] allocater#0000
Exeler is making them by the hundreds


[17-Oct-22 12:14 PM] exeler#0000
I've got 2 HWP cranking out 20 BHP and LHP per day. @allocater has already pre purchased the next 400 of each that I'm making. 

After that I'm more than happy to keep making them indefinitely at that pace if someone is buying.


[17-Oct-22 12:19 PM] churavis#0000
I need 22 BHP for repairs and 64 LHP for my next ship but I can't wait 20 days


[17-Oct-22 12:20 PM] allocater#0000

[17-Oct-22 10:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
Nine planets plus the expansion plan make me tired of managing logistics. Now I'm ready to store consumables for more than 30 days to avoid frequent replenishment.

I think that's why you should make all those BMPs and sell everyone OVE 1000 at a time 😄


[17-Oct-22 11:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
I just setup a whole bunch of BMPs to produce a variety of consumables on Phobos... I'm still spinning it up to full scale (more cash flow requirements for these inputs that for DW and RAT), but I will have large numbers of them churning out soon.


[17-Oct-22 11:24 PM] churavis#0000
Phobos is electronics, Heph is manufacturing


[17-Oct-22 11:27 PM] dehzhas#0000
I produce DW on Heph... I'm just breaking on the planet X is for Y rules (unless it's resource extraction or fertile soil I need)


[17-Oct-22 11:30 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm just going to end up producing truly massive amounts of consumables, stacking every rocky planet near ANT with FP and BMP, rigging and mining every available water source and fertile planet. Not optimal, but I will leave my mark as one of the premier consumables producers in Ant space. 🤓

[17-Oct-22 11:35 PM] churavis#0000
It's not that there are rules for what industry you can or can't do on whatever planet it's just that you won't get the CoGC efficiency bonus, which is hugely important


[18-Oct-22 12:20 AM] dehzhas#0000
It depends on your bottleneck. For me, there have been a few bottlenecks:
1. Planets that are the next logical/available step given my current logistics
2. The logistics of moving things around
3. Planets that have key resources (H2O, fertility)


[18-Oct-22 12:22 AM] dehzhas#0000
H2O in particular is a huge bottleneck for my FP's. Thus, I tend to optimize rigs on those planets with CoGC extraction for maximum output. My FPs can produce everything I need if I keep them supplied, which is one the the harder parts.


[18-Oct-22 12:23 AM] dehzhas#0000
My manufacturing tends to produce more than enough volume, so CoGC bonus doesn't really do me much good for what I am trying to do.


[18-Oct-22 12:25 AM] dehzhas#0000
CoGC is critical for a fully pipelined steady state, but I'm in hyper-growth stages so building a new base is more valuable than optimizing or re-tooling an old one unless that is the best way to relieve a bottleneck.


[18-Oct-22 12:25 AM] dehzhas#0000
Eventually, yes, I will want to maximize my CoGC bonuses, it just doesn't matter much at the moment given the other options I have.


[18-Oct-22 01:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
COGC is very important to chemical industry and electronics, which greatly affects profits. But for some overproduction, with large capacity consumption production，the impact is much smaller.


[18-Oct-22 01:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, the biggest advantage of the core planet in ANT region is that COGC can coordinate the division of labor and improve the production capacity. If you like not to consider COGC, in fact, frontier regions such as demeter are more suitable for this way


[18-Oct-22 01:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
There are also some planets with heavy minerals and low consumption. It is very appropriate to make finished products and then transport them to cx. Consumables are usually light, even considering water, so it is advantageous to make full use of COGC.


[18-Oct-22 01:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that 1000 ove is just enough for 30 days.🤣

[18-Oct-22 06:58 AM] _bojidar#0000
So with so many huge producers around here..is there anything left needed to be produced for the Corp?


[18-Oct-22 07:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
AL and fabs are always needed


[18-Oct-22 07:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you develop to a more advanced stage, you need to join the production of chemical or advanced consumables, or enter the shipbuilding sector.


[18-Oct-22 08:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the higher level fabs, like rfabs and afabs are definitely needed, and will be profitable to sell outside the corp as well. So if you would like a challenge, go for that 😄


[18-Oct-22 08:18 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I think we've got people shifting to high level fabs


[18-Oct-22 08:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now I am 10 pp2 and 3 pp3, and after a while I may adjust to 6 pp2 and 6 pp3.


[18-Oct-22 08:22 AM] yuen8241#0000
The demand of Afabs is not so high. insensless was the only one who had a pp4.


[18-Oct-22 08:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I think it's pretty high given the number of us building AMLs and almost to Afab HQ upgrades


[18-Oct-22 08:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
but Churavis is doing them and I believe we may have others


[18-Oct-22 08:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
darkfuel hasn't done anything in corp yet, would be pretty crazy to jump right to producing afabs


[18-Oct-22 08:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
It's good that he produces Bfabs first.


[18-Oct-22 08:25 AM] churavis#0000
Both Pokter and Insenseless had a PP4, now I am the only one


[18-Oct-22 08:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that their Nike base is either 1000 or 750.


[18-Oct-22 08:28 AM] churavis#0000
PP4 uses about 1 PP3 worth of inputs and a whole bunch of other inputs and a crazy amount of AL and other niche materials so I don't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have a ton of other bases and supply chains already up and running


[18-Oct-22 08:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that their deimos base is also 1000.


[18-Oct-22 09:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
My deimos base only covers an area of 500. Considering that I still have SKF and ASM, which are two big consumers of AL and TI, it's very good for me to produce Rfabs to transform AL demand into EPO demand. After all, I can build multiple chemical bases. However, this will  cause i need to  purchase bfabs.


[18-Oct-22 10:28 AM] allocater#0000
PSM/PSL etc are also still tied and profitable on the CX, so a PPF base on heph.


[18-Oct-22 11:31 AM] allocater#0000
what do you think of colonizing SE-110b and SE-110d? They could be used as processing planets or hydroponic farming planet.


[18-Oct-22 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Antares I b is a tempting target, is high-temperature TSH drastically worse than SEA + INS?


[18-Oct-22 11:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Antares I should already have a lot of STL ships available. Although it's further to haul the water


[18-Oct-22 11:55 AM] churavis#0000
TSH is PP4 tier and requires THP, so once you get me that I could make about 3 per day


[18-Oct-22 11:56 AM] churavis#0000
That's assuming no one else needs Afabs, of course


[18-Oct-22 11:58 AM] allocater#0000
TSH is the worst, basically no hot planets are colonized because of it


[18-Oct-22 01:33 PM] jackinabox86#0000
TSH is really really hard.  We barely have a PP4 running as it is


[18-Oct-22 01:39 PM] churavis#0000
My PP4 is running just fine but demand is likely to outstrip supply sooner or later


[18-Oct-22 01:42 PM] allocater#0000
would it make sense to have 1 person producing only 1 type of  Afab, then it's easier to manage the inputs?


[18-Oct-22 01:47 PM] churavis#0000
For me personally the Afabs aren't a problem, or at least not once I get a Griffon base up and running for the NR, that's the only thing I've had trouble sourcing


[18-Oct-22 01:48 PM] churavis#0000
TSH however would be a problem and I'm not likely to make it unless the THP were provided


[19-Oct-22 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
.... news wire .... 
Kowa-Bunga is re-organizing and specializing on the fermentation operations to meet the GIN demands of Antares Region and expand into the other galactic markets. All other operations have been razed, including all holdings on Harmonia, leaving 14 FERmentation plants on Nike. The breaking of ground of 10 new FER on Norwick is expected, within days.

I just buy a large quantity of the consumables. Think about it once a month and the rest of the time it isn't an issue.

Same with the inputs for my buildings. Each of my bases generally only has one or two things that it needs regularly shipped because storing a month's stock is difficult or impossible to do.

Without pmmg, when you have four populations on the same planet, you will be very tired of 19 consumables.

[20-Oct-22 10:43 AM] allocater#0000
I have a crazy idea to make a non-fertile farming planet in ANT region. So only HYF.

local resources don't matter much since import H2O+NS(LST+N) will always be lower than the crop export.

candidates are so far:
IY-816d (next to Nascent)
ZV-194b (nike system)
SE-110b / SE-110d (water in system)
YK-005d (between nascent and norwick)

what do you think?


[20-Oct-22 10:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
interesting that ZV-104b hasn't been used for something, since it only needs INS and is in a good location.  I guess I'd probably go with IY-816d given the water right there


[20-Oct-22 10:54 AM] jackinabox86#0000
SE is a good system, but we don't do as much over there.  Now that folks on are Ice Station Alpha, maybe that's not a big deal


[20-Oct-22 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
I like the idea generally. I have a bunch of thoughts.
1) We have a lot of potential for more bases on easy Harmonia or Demeter planets. I was talking about this with Tux earlier today. Blue column is people without bases on Demeter. http://kortham.homeip.net/files/chrome_2022-10-20_08-43-25.png It is possible to run a demeter base without ever sending a ship out there via local contracts. 
2) It feels like proximity to water is the most important for running HYFs. I think the Ice Station Alpha system is really good in that regard. Output shipping can be pretty low compared to the water coming in, especially if a lot of those HYFs are making CAF.

[20-Oct-22 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
3) I always want people to buy my MHL for HYFs. I have 6 WP that have been 100% MHL their whole life. But MHL goes pretty fast and we'll need to pick some up on the market. I can export Iodine if people want to make more MHL elsewhere, although I is heavy


[20-Oct-22 11:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Offering base teleports + consumables (even if they are fully paid) to demeter is probably more cost effective to get the basic crops


[20-Oct-22 11:04 AM] allocater#0000
2) true, with CAF local resources matter because import will be higher than export if there is nothing local


[20-Oct-22 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I like the idea of several players making HYF bases on a Agriculture COGC planet, and one player going all FP on that planet with their food industries experts. Even if the FP player loses the COGC, it can compress inputs well... especially the H2O -> DW -> COF chain


[20-Oct-22 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000

[20-Oct-22 02:05 PM] exeler#0000
This has been on my to-do list for a little while. 

I currently run a hybrid setup like this on Harmonia just so I don't have to ship the crops off planet.

I've been feeding 12 INC all the HCP and MAI they can take (even with GRN import to burn the fast recipe) and making a little CAF on the side since the HYF are able to really crank out huge volumes of crops. 

The main downside for me is just the initial cost as the MHL are incredibly expensive compared to the rest of the building supplies.

The profit margins on the crops are worse because you need more H2O per crop you produce, as well as the added NS, but the issue with crops has never been the margins. The area cost for a FRM and the long production times are the biggest drawback to farming for me, and HYF solves both of those problems.

After I get my NS base set up, I wouldn't mind risking setting up a 100% HYF base somewhere. I would want to make sure that there's an in-corp use for the volume of crops that the base produces though. 

I'm guessing that there's plenty of INC that are currently just burning GRN that would greatly benefit from large quantities of readily available HCP and MAI.

I think we will find a use for the crops, crops are most valuable in ANT region and can be turned into C or RAT, both of which is also crazy in demand.

Of course if someone wants to build Harmonia and Demeter bases, we will always prioritize supporting that

I’m at work right now will be home at my computer in 6ish hours to sell stuff. Bit hard on the phone


[20-Oct-22 02:17 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, building a FRM base is always more cost effective, except in terms of permits. 

If everyone had 35 permits, and fertile planets were more common, we probably wouldn't consider HYF except for CAF. But neither of those is true, so being able to get 4X more crops (or more) out of the same area in exchange for a higher initial cost makes sense to me.


[20-Oct-22 02:17 PM] _bojidar#0000
well i could get any RAT/DW up to 1000/1000


[20-Oct-22 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Our carbon making members will buy HCP and MAI in bulk. I'd buy MAI or NUT for ration production (I move the crops to Nike for food processing, others have their FP on other planets)


[20-Oct-22 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you enjoy farming, I would also suggest a base on Demeter, corp members can supply the water there, and will buy crops directly.


[20-Oct-22 02:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am happy to pre-buy crops also. Many other people are too. I'll pay now for crops you'll be making over the next week, for example.


[20-Oct-22 02:24 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It works on a couple other browsers.  If you let us know what you use, we can see if that works.  FIO works on any browser, and if you are playing this without that, you should STRONGLY consider FIO


[20-Oct-22 02:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't see how it works in other browsers. Everything I am reading says it only works in google chrome, and I use firefox because it is built into my operating system... And, yeah, it is easy to be envious of players using add-on user-interface tools making it more managable.


[20-Oct-22 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
FIO works in firefox if you use it with tampermonkey. I use the tampermonkey version on Chrome, because I have been messing around with it a bit.

what are products where the consumables have the least amount of impact? Those would be candidates to run in permanently decayed bases, which essentially have 3 times consumable costs. 3 times consumable costs also has to be cheaper than repairing the base.


[23-Oct-22 06:29 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I treat my GAL base like that. I could ship it and sell some or just use what I need and save on HSE for repairs


[23-Oct-22 06:36 AM] allocater#0000
exactly, if you only build the base once it also opens up viability of building on HSE and TSH planets


[24-Oct-22 01:33 AM] allocater#0000
does an EDC base that buys BSE produce more BSE than a BSE base? 🤔


[24-Oct-22 01:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't understand what you're saying. EDC mainly depends on Rfabs


[24-Oct-22 01:38 AM] allocater#0000
but if you have an EDC base and sell all EDC at lowMM and buy BSE at highMM, do you make more BSE than a BSE production base?

{Reactions}
🤯 

[24-Oct-22 01:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, more.

{Reactions}
😮 

[24-Oct-22 01:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
But EDC cost recovery cycle is long. Suitable for people who have more money and nowhere to spend, and pursue higher overall returns.


[24-Oct-22 01:39 AM] allocater#0000
which is us! 😄 EDC base for everyone!


[24-Oct-22 01:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
So if each of us develops to the later stage, it is suitable to build SE base on phobos. This makes it very profitable for us to manage PHobos.


[24-Oct-22 01:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
Poketer is a typical example. He snowballed through pp3 and SE.


[24-Oct-22 01:43 AM] allocater#0000
yes, but first we need to establish R-fab industry, I think


[24-Oct-22 01:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
That's what I'm doing, participating in shipbuilding, developing the construction industry, entering the chemical industry, and then earning more money through SE.


[24-Oct-22 01:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there is not enough chemical industry and construction industry, SE cannot be supported at all.


[24-Oct-22 01:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
It takes about two or three chemical planets, two agricultural planets, one food planet, one metallurgical planet and one building planet to support an SE planet.

Pokter's griff, Phobos, Nike, and deimos bases are all 1000-area.I estimates that he totally depends on cx for consumables, but if many of us do this, cx will not be able to provide enough consumables, so it's better to produce some of them ourselves.

These FIM alone have to be supported by two agricultural bases, one food base and one chemical planet.


[24-Oct-22 01:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
We also need to consider the industries that provide maintenance for infrastructure. Some things can't be bought stably in cx.


[24-Oct-22 02:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
So it's better to go to other cx to sell EDC, and then buy consumables and raw materials. Otherwise, ANT's inflation will be very serious.😅


[24-Oct-22 02:03 AM] allocater#0000
yes let's destroy all other currencies 😄


[24-Oct-22 07:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
1 mil AIC/day buys 645 BSE from the MM per day. Sounds better than a Nike base 😄


[24-Oct-22 09:36 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I wonder if they will nerf EDC soon? Like lower the MM payout on it so its less lucrative? Or is it only lucrative here because we get both ANT electronics bonus and the Phobos COGC bonus?


[24-Oct-22 09:41 AM] domicius#0000
It's lucrative because it has zero inputs and good value


[24-Oct-22 09:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
Even if you don't even have COGC and expert rewards, you can make money. The only limitation is the engineer population.


[24-Oct-22 09:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
And sometimes, other people pay for the engineer population costs 😉


[24-Oct-22 09:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
So this industry encourages hitchhiking.


[24-Oct-22 09:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think previously, the lack of high level consumables were also a constraint, but that is lifting a bit.


[24-Oct-22 09:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
Instead of others doing this, we should do it ourselves in phobos. After all, we will pay the infrastructure cost.


[24-Oct-22 09:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm also worried that someone will use nike's engineer population to do this.😅


[24-Oct-22 09:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
I met a NEO guy before. He is a free user, but his base is all on the electronics planet. He fought me for FIM at HRT.

But generally speaking, Deimos is enough.


[26-Oct-22 09:35 AM] rune_242#0000
there is no RG on the CX at the moment

Unless you have a lot of PP3, two GF's are enough to maintain.


[26-Oct-22 09:36 AM] rune_242#0000

[26-Oct-22 10:32 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if you want to do more GF, just go to Antares II B.  I have 500 area bases on both it and Deimos.  GF on A2b makes a lot of sense because the shipping needs are so low.  And @yuen8241 there's a fair amount of GL used by pop upkeep; it's not just fabs


[26-Oct-22 10:32 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I run 5 GF's on Deimos and I have 400 RG if you need some. But I go through it quick because GEN requires a shit-ton

[26-Oct-22 10:36 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think we need some improvements to our current glass making. But I don't think making a GF planet is the right course. Perhaps more coordination would be good though:

Someone to focus on low tier glasses like GL and TUB
Someone to focus on mid tier - RG and NG
And then a GEN maker - GCH, GNZ, and GEN (this one can buy RG from the middle one because lots of it is needed)


[26-Oct-22 10:37 AM] allocater#0000
actually I mixed up optitronic with oasis 😅 no matter, now we should have both 😄


[26-Oct-22 10:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, I see it, but I usually only make it myself in the RG step, and I will directly purchase the subsequent finished products of GL.


[26-Oct-22 10:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Right now we lack TUB in planetary infrastructure and I can't take my GF's off GL>RG>GCH>NG>GNZ>GEN cycle or we will fall behind with GEN demand. Currently only one in stock and I think I heard talk of some more demand coming our way?
Maybe @churavis or @rune_242 could make TUB for infrastructure? Or supply my GL + RG and I can make some?


[26-Oct-22 10:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Wait, so we are still unsure who Oasis is?


[26-Oct-22 10:43 AM] rune_242#0000
I'll build a base on antares IIb and make  GL and TUB

the *ELECTION WATCH* says Phobos's election is starting soon. Looks like it starts in 20h, so my math is reasonably close 😄


[26-Oct-22 06:00 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, I'm already running, I've topped off the upkeep, I've been running education programs, which seem more effective at generating engineers.
 My only opponent is this game's equivalent of a street bum but I'm not taking chances.

It's too far. What is it mainly for?


[28-Oct-22 04:41 AM] rune_242#0000
glass


[28-Oct-22 04:41 AM] rune_242#0000
glass doesn't require much shipping


[28-Oct-22 04:41 AM] rune_242#0000
you could fly just once a month and be fine


[28-Oct-22 04:42 AM] allocater#0000
with local SIO and metal COGC it has the potential to becoming the glass capital of Antares

However, nearly 1,000 settlers are hard to cultivate.


[28-Oct-22 04:56 AM] rune_242#0000
if you build just INF you only need TUB for upkeep

and a SST too of course


[28-Oct-22 04:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, but we need a pioneer population first. But these pioneers have nothing to do except mine.


[28-Oct-22 04:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
Settlers of deimos can do EXT, COL and SME in pioneer stage.

Maybe we can transport some Tio here for smelting?

interesting question on how to develop a planet with minimal PIO to max SET


[28-Oct-22 05:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, the pressure of transportation is too great, and two WBCs are needed  to do it.

I am. My base has a slow trickle at the moment depending on how much you need.


[28-Oct-22 04:42 PM] churavis#0000
Where and how much can you spare?


[28-Oct-22 04:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
Base is in MOR space, but I slow ship it over to ANT. I have a spare 200 at the moment, and will have roughly that every week. It would be easy to increase that if needed.

If you want, in the future I can hitch a ride for it to another planet. Where do you use it?

I use it on Heph for SEN and Griff for NS, although I have a puddlejumper that makes regular trips between ANT, Phobos and Heph so don't go out of your way


[28-Oct-22 04:54 PM] dehzhas#0000
ANT is probably best if you send it 2 different ways. I have a puddlejumper that hits Heph as well, but I'll just let you do the split on Ant

I need both SFK and MFK, small quantities now, but will grow some


[29-Oct-22 12:46 PM] exeler#0000
How much extra STL do you produce?

I use a little bit for the HWP and make it myself from FEO. I end up making excess STL, but I'd rather make excess AL, but it's hard to get the ratio right because of how little STL I use compared to the AL


[29-Oct-22 12:46 PM] exeler#0000
I'd be interested in just buying the STL and swapping to full AL production again.


[29-Oct-22 12:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
I also need STL 🙂


[29-Oct-22 12:47 PM] churavis#0000
How much STL I make depends on how much O I can get my hands on


[29-Oct-22 12:48 PM] exeler#0000
I currently have been buying huge quantities of O and have a decent stockpile for exactly the same reason 😅


[29-Oct-22 12:48 PM] churavis#0000
I offer it on Deimos all the time but nobody bites so I've just been shipping it to the CX


[29-Oct-22 12:49 PM] exeler#0000
I've been doing the same 😅 

The CX is almost out of demand for STL so if I can stop making it and give you some regular demand for it, I think that works out better


[29-Oct-22 12:50 PM] churavis#0000
It's listed on the price sheet as well


[29-Oct-22 12:50 PM] dehzhas#0000
Sent you a bunch of contracts for HSE so you can fill what you have. I meant to set them for > 1 day, but forgot. Let me know if that is a problem.

Omg. I will buy O all the time


[29-Oct-22 12:51 PM] jackinabox86#0000

If I can get O from you guys on Etherwind then I won't have to raise my price for STL


[29-Oct-22 12:55 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah O has the biggest impact on the price of STL right? The FEO is cheap, and C is cheap if you have a source.


[29-Oct-22 01:08 PM] balbar#0000
You already bought my last stock, but I produce about 3/d on Griffonstone. so if you need TCS just send me a contract or post here and i'll sell it for 4000/u

[30-Oct-22 04:05 PM] churavis#0000
I believe 10k is just what Allocater has been offering for it on the CX, although there are several bids above him now and the offers are at 13k minimum so he probably won't get much at that price any time soon. Balbar has been great about getting me TCS so I can provide it for 8k/u and I have enough in stock for both of you.

10 should be plenty for me since my Nike base uses 0.1 per day and my Phobos base uses 0 per day.

I just switched my DW production to the non-PG version. I am going to produce like huge amounts of DW per day, but going to run through H2O like its going out of style. I will hit probably 4.5k/day sustained for a while, but my margins will tank while I run in this mode.


[31-Oct-22 08:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Is your profit per day or unit of time higher with the fast recipe though? Margin on a given recipe is pretty immaterial to me


[31-Oct-22 08:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
Generally speaking, DW production formula without PG will make less money.

Not to mention that the water saved can be used for other purposes.


[31-Oct-22 08:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
That is not necessarily true. Particularly when the price of DW is high


[31-Oct-22 08:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
Then you can even build more FPs to consume this H2O.


[31-Oct-22 08:47 PM] dehzhas#0000
At the moment, at 70+ per unit, the margins get closer, but prunner has higher margins with PG until PG gets pretty cheap and DW gets pretty expensive.


[31-Oct-22 08:48 PM] balbar#0000
I'll also take 10 please

[31-Oct-22 08:48 PM] dehzhas#0000
But, the main issue with H2O only is the unbelievable amount of H2O I have to ship around.


[31-Oct-22 08:50 PM] dehzhas#0000
A single base with 4 experts can produce 2384 DW per day but consume 3472 H2O in the process. I need 1.5 Etherwind planets per DW production planet to keep up with that and massive 2k ships constantly running it around. At that rate, A single 2k ship can only carry 3 days of H2O.


[31-Oct-22 08:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you simply use one fp planet to produce dw to consume etherwind's water, you can switch back and forth between the two production formulas to maximize profits.


[31-Oct-22 08:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
But generally speaking, there is only one H2O planet for each of us, and there are still many places where H2O is needed, so it is better to use Pg formula to save water.  If you are willing to buy H2O to produce more DW, that's fine, but in this case you can even build a second FP planet.


[31-Oct-22 08:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have 2 planets full FP on DW, working on more, so it would be almost impossible to keep up with that H2O consumption on the fast mode.


[31-Oct-22 08:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm doing it for now to beat the scalper, but I have to buy a lot of H2O to do it. It really eats into my margins that way.


[31-Oct-22 08:59 PM] yuen8241#0000
It's really unnecessary. Such a high price will attract more people to produce DW or resell DW to ANT. It's impossible to have a high price for a long time.


[31-Oct-22 09:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
I prefer to store up more reserves at ordinary times and attack scalpers when they appear.


[31-Oct-22 09:01 PM] dehzhas#0000
I don't tend to keep much of it around since demand is high and it's my main business.


[31-Oct-22 09:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
However, DW is just in need of hard currency, and scalpers are not easily trapped.


[31-Oct-22 09:02 PM] dehzhas#0000
My ultimate goal here is to keep consumables in Ant space fairly low cost to promote development of the region and cheaper products.

RedWolvesGaming has been around for 175 days and has 1 planet. My guess is they are a full time scalper.

I just want them to go somewhere else and not mess with the tier 1 and 2 consumables in Ant space.

That would be epic


[31-Oct-22 09:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that I can adopt the strategy of maintaining hierarchical pricing in the future. Half of DW is used to sell quickly, and the other half is set at a higher price to prevent scalpers from sweeping goods.


[31-Oct-22 09:44 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, basically stone wall their higher price, pick a lower bound and fulfill every buy order above that price.


[31-Oct-22 09:48 PM] dehzhas#0000
It looks like we have it stonewalled now, and I make more DW on heph than the CX typically moves historically, so I think we got’em.


[31-Oct-22 10:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Did anyone ask "NIRCo 2" to drop his DW price from 99.00 to 98.98 so those 5000 units would undercut the scalper?


[31-Oct-22 10:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly if he's buying DW at 97 AIC to repost it, we're winning 😄


[31-Oct-22 10:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
It's okay. Let him sweep the goods. The prices are not low now. When the new DW is delivered, he will be stuck.

[02-Nov-22 10:55 AM] allocater#0000
in theory the market reveals the bottlenecks, i.e. what is most profitable. At the moment we feel the lack of PSM/PSL and BDE the most, so PP~~T~~F base on heph or PP1 base on nike sound good? of course there is always need for AL smelting on deimos 😄 Really up to you what you find fun or if you want to calculate the most profitable goods.

[02-Nov-22 10:59 AM] allocater#0000

But so we have the C for a POL base?


[02-Nov-22 11:57 AM] balbar#0000

[02-Nov-22 11:57 AM] churavis#0000

I mixed some CHP into my POL base to make the CL I need. Just gotta buy the HAL on the LM.

I make a little bit of extra CL and occasionally sell it on the Griffonstone LM or CX. 

I don't know if it is worthwhile to have a dedicated CHP base for that since the experts stack with the POL. Plus whoever gets stuck with the CHP base churning out CL will be stuck with mountains of NA to deal with. Plus you give up the opportunity to make and sell the more lucrative PG and EPO.

The scalper moved the DW price lower. If you had DW bids, you should lower them below the new price.

thanks for the notice, done


[03-Nov-22 03:35 AM] exeler#0000
How much demand is there for NS and who currently is making it? I'm gearing up to build my next base and I want to make NS to fuel my HYF.

If I max out a base then I'm making like 10x more NS than I need. What are the chances I find buyers for up to 300 NS a day? I could probably undercut the current prices by a bit and offer a stable 140/u price.


[03-Nov-22 03:51 AM] gladeowl#0000
Is INS in demand as a construction material? I see a lot of bases that need it but don't really see a steady supply other than one person having a near-monopoly in the CX.
I was thinking about starting one on Nike. It's pretty cheap to start with 100/day.


[03-Nov-22 04:00 AM] allocater#0000
I produce NS in my N base when I realized that there is not enough N demand to fill it, but 300/day is the entire production. I am currently working towards a stable 200 price on the CX.


[03-Nov-22 04:01 AM] exeler#0000
300 NS per day is a pretty hefty amount. I only need 50 or so per day.

If you're already making a large excess of NS then I might look for a different plan to avoid over flooding the market


[03-Nov-22 04:02 AM] allocater#0000
you could probably undercut the monopoly at 114 if that price is profitable. There should always be stable demand for it.


[03-Nov-22 04:03 AM] gladeowl#0000
I can sell to the CX for 114/u and you lads for 70/u, and still have it float ok.


[03-Nov-22 04:04 AM] allocater#0000
sounds like a plan, you can also switch from time to time to r-fabs if those are more profitable


[03-Nov-22 04:08 AM] allocater#0000
I'll give it another week to see if the market can absorb my production. I certainly can fulfill your 50/day.


[03-Nov-22 04:13 AM] exeler#0000
Sounds good, I think I'll start playing more seriously with an idea to make an LI/POW base on KI-439b in the meantime


[03-Nov-22 04:38 AM] exeler#0000
Or making a crapton of PE on Hephaestus. What's the market for H look like? If I wanted to buy 230 a day would that be sustainable?


[03-Nov-22 06:15 AM] domicius#0000
I think most H goes into fuel


[03-Nov-22 06:48 AM] jackinabox86#0000
H is probably a bit lean. Not like it was a while ago, but we lost all our major suppliers other than YJ I think


[03-Nov-22 07:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll buy excess LIO if you end up with some.


[03-Nov-22 08:01 AM] domicius#0000
If someone wants to throw me some advice, I'll build an H base.

can't recall where Pokter was, but that took HSE


[03-Nov-22 09:04 AM] sginga#0000
KI-401d looks like the best one nearby, but it requires INS and AEF, but even a small base produces alot of H and has a decent ROI

[03-Nov-22 11:17 AM] exeler#0000
I think a decently profitable PE base demands either a lower H price or a higher PE price. Especially if I want to make a large quantity like 20k PE per day that will probably impact prices on the market a bit.

All the decent H planets in ANT seem to require expensive materials to build, but are worth it once they get running. 

Target price for H I was hoping for was ~60/u. If that's way too low given current market conditions I'm happy to either chip in for an H base that can sustain that or build one myself first.


[03-Nov-22 11:24 AM] allocater#0000
I feel like 20k PE/day can work, we just turn half of it into BDE and PE has increased in price parallel to H. Worst case you switch all the BMPs to one of the other profitable recipes.


[03-Nov-22 12:32 PM] exeler#0000
I think I'm gonna start with a small number of BMP on Heph and increase it over time. 

If I ever struggle to source the H or it gets too expensive, I'll either sponsor or build my own H base.

What do you think, is it time for another price sheet update, where everybody adjusts their discount offers to:
* remove offers that are no longer available (regularly or in reasonable quantities)
* adjust prices to something more reasonable (i.e. higher) according to the current market situation? Of course everyone can always do this, but if there is an official update round, it's more likely to happen.

I’m not too fussed about the corp fab prices. We did a big increase a few months ago. It’s still a good discount, but I don’t mind selling at the current prices. Anyone new is able to sell at any price they want though. Those of us selling at the lower prices do so bc we have cheap supply lines and all the bonuses

If we need C somewhere, I think I can build, or we can sponsor a C fountain to make the C directly on the planet. That should cut down on shipping a lot. 

I think a single C fountain makes enough C for multiple POL bases.

@allocater or @yuen8241 can you move some part of your DW sell order on ANT to 78 or 79? The scalper has tried to scalp a smaller order at a lower price and I have 1.1k as the only buffer at the moment.

I wanted to pause my production (because I ran out of AMM and knew it would take a few days to replace it). I hid the consumables in a warehouse, but production continued even after (what I incorrectly presumed was the start of the cycle timer) the Norwick Population Report 16 hours ago.

So I kept checking back to see what would happen. Finally, just now, the workforce consumables went empty for some items:

Two interesting things: the timer on the KOM is not in sync with the others, and also the REP seems to continue using something from the prior day (presumably 0.8 unit remainder.


[08-Nov-22 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I also learned something else, when I tried this before.. if you add the consumables back, within the same 24 hour cycle, then the entire amount will be consumed (even though there was only 12 hours left of the cycle).

My understanding is that a POPR, new building, getting new consumables after a shortage or any other event that affects the rate of consumption will reset your consumption cycle to be the time of day of that event.

We should build some strategic reserves on important materials to prevent this kind of scalper from doing such a thing in ANT.


[08-Nov-22 04:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
In addition to the internal production capacity, you can make long-term low-price acquisition in ANT, and then reserve the goods in ANT.


[08-Nov-22 04:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have bought a lot before and haven't sold it yet. I usually ship it to other cx to sell it. It seems necessary to ensure a certain inventory in ANT.

If each of us produces, soon he will be stuck. BSE is the biggest-selling fabs. However, we'd better take the strategy of only 0.01AIC cheaper to avoid him eating our chips again.

I don’t know that I want ANT space to be some cheap region either. If that happens naturally, great, but I joined a trading game to make money!


[08-Nov-22 05:12 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Everyone else seems amped to stop the scalping, so I’ll bow to the will of the corp, but we should probably pick a few key mats to care about and not impact our own ability to grow on the way

[08-Nov-22 05:16 PM] dehzhas#0000
For my part, I think it is only really worth trying to stop scalping on high volume essentials like DW, RAT, OVE and others that the region needs to keep going strong. It would be nice to stop scalping on bfabs, but you can wait on those if you have to. Basic consumables will quickly keep new players from being liquid


[08-Nov-22 05:19 PM] dehzhas#0000
Prices generally seem on the rise as demand is high. Gives scalpers the advantage. I think the most effective mitigation is to keep the essentials readily available.


[08-Nov-22 05:31 PM] domicius#0000
It's one way for a rich person to get richer. I have no strong feelings about it though.


[08-Nov-22 05:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
A scalper spent a bunch of money to raise the price of goods, every good you sell at the raised price is bonus profit you didn't "pay for" (in the form if buying to inflate prices)


[08-Nov-22 06:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
In a sense, fabs scalpers will increase the number of nike bases. People who can't stand the high price of fabs will come to nike to build a base to produce their own products.


[08-Nov-22 06:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
Scalping will tend to increase prices and encourage people to build those bases. Scalping is a short term move when there is a supply shortage.


[08-Nov-22 06:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
Scalping only works long term if you can prevent the supply from improving. It might work longer in this game because the supply might not be able to keep up with demand for a while.


[08-Nov-22 06:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
Fabs is different. It is generally used for expansion. If the cost is too high, it can be postponed or even cancelled. But consumables can't. .


[08-Nov-22 06:26 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
New players may be less likely to tolerate high fab prices rather than slightly higher consumables as the feedback cycle of expanding their base is longer and harder to achieve making the start of the game even more tedious.


[08-Nov-22 06:28 PM] exeler#0000
And one solution for a new player is just to quit the game, which sucks.


[08-Nov-22 06:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
For new players, fabs is the biggest expense. If ANT's fabs is expensive, they can go to other cx to buy it. Considering that the price difference is so large, it is appropriate, and the initial ship is enough to bring them back.


[08-Nov-22 06:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
Goods with high weight, high consumption and high frequency are generally not easy to buy from other cx.


[08-Nov-22 06:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
The most typical ones are C and metal.


[08-Nov-22 06:31 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
A really new 1st or 2nd week player won't do that though, not after being told to sell half their fuel and seeing it will take a number of days to get there and back. They also don't have the capital to make saving a few hundred credits on a handful of bfabs to cover the cost of flying to another CX and back worth it.


[08-Nov-22 06:32 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Cheaper bfabs encourage growth and that will mean older players can sell more other higher tier products to newer players


[08-Nov-22 06:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
The current situation is that the total differnce price is about 100,000, and generally, the cross-cx trade of the initial ship simply can't earn so much.


[08-Nov-22 06:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
As a matter of fact, a WBC ship can't earn so much unless it buys very expensive goods.


[08-Nov-22 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I posted some extra building fab inventory that was sitting at ANT to undercut the scalper. I will take it back off tomorrow when it doesn't sell.


[09-Nov-22 12:29 AM] dehzhas#0000
Thinking this through a bit more, basically, the active scalping that is taking place is a sign that the materials being scalped are priced too low.


[09-Nov-22 12:29 AM] churavis#0000
Only according to one person


[09-Nov-22 12:30 AM] dehzhas#0000
If people didn't agree, they wouldn't buy at the higher price.


[09-Nov-22 12:30 AM] churavis#0000
If people don't agree then they sell it for less, which is exactly what happened for most the items


[09-Nov-22 12:31 AM] dehzhas#0000
That is, if the materials are already near the high end of their actual value, the scalper can't make money. If they are making money, then people are willing to pay that price at some level.


[09-Nov-22 12:32 AM] dehzhas#0000
Exactly, people are willing to sell for less, but in theory, the scalper could just swoop in and buy those goods too, limited only by capital.


[09-Nov-22 12:34 AM] dehzhas#0000
To make money, the scalper has to be able to sell though. One of the DW scalpers has been scalping PG. People are still paying for it though because the demand is high and the price hasn't made it a negative ROI.


[09-Nov-22 12:46 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Basically bfabs are like petrol or drugs, demand is largely inelastic as the price rises because there are no alternatives


[09-Nov-22 12:47 AM] churavis#0000
There are alternatives in the mid to long term, say other CX or building your own construction base

[10-Nov-22 02:20 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Last time I needed SC I got the TA and CA off the CX and made it myself. I can make you some but there will be some days of lead time to get the materials and get them to Griffonstone


[10-Nov-22 02:26 PM] gladeowl#0000
Probably a better idea than just hoping somebody sells it on the CX. I'll give you an advance warning when I need it.


[10-Nov-22 03:24 PM] exeler#0000
I can also make a batch on Griffonstone provided the supplies. I've got a lot of extra CHP time that's currently just making extra CL to sell that I could switch to some other goods on demand.


[10-Nov-22 03:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 30 extra SC on Griff and queued up another 40.


[10-Nov-22 03:46 PM] archielvahr#0000

How are your thoughts going about the NEon base, near Hortus? Were you thinking about starting on AJ-135e ?


[14-Nov-22 06:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thinking about making a NEon base myself, after struggling to source AEF. I think there is a demand for it, plus a market maker.


[14-Nov-22 06:48 AM] gladeowl#0000
I was thinking about Nova Honshu, because of being cheap to build on and having a LM I can rely on, as I feel a bit iffy sending my starter ships that far, even with pit stops.
Considering the recipe for AEF uses 1 NE every 12 hours. The input should be fairly low.
I still have a fair bit before I can think about that base however, I still need to get the INS base on Nike to full swing.


[14-Nov-22 07:27 AM] rune_242#0000
are there people who need more H or are bottle necked by shipping time of H?


[14-Nov-22 07:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
At present, PE and PG are very expensive in the market. Obviously, we lack internal H suppliers.

Trying to think up a good resource extraction base to start. Hydrogen seems good to me, with a decent planet in Antares II


[14-Nov-22 11:09 AM] churavis#0000
Antares II g had a good amount of H but it's pretty far out in the system so you'll want to avoid intersystem travel. AEF and INS might be a challenge as well


[14-Nov-22 11:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I send my 2000 out every once in a while. I have a base on Avalon for TS but I don't make the trip often. I could bring some shipments back with me when I go out tho. Is the planet youre thinking about close to the Hortus system?


[14-Nov-22 11:41 AM] gladeowl#0000
Nova Honshu (BS-788c), it's 2 jumps from the Hortus CX.


[14-Nov-22 11:42 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm kind of cautious about my H production right now, Pokter was helping a lot with corp demand on H so I'm concerned my production may not keep up now that he's gone. Currently only a few hundred H available on QJ382g. We could certainly use another H base if someone is considering it


[14-Nov-22 11:43 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, my H demand is only going to increase as I’m increasing my fuel production by 50% and also doing more PG and EPO


[14-Nov-22 11:43 AM] jackinabox86#0000
And CL


[14-Nov-22 11:44 AM] jackinabox86#0000

[14-Nov-22 01:55 PM] exeler#0000
I also am going to be consuming huge amounts of H on Hephaestus for PE. So a base on A2G would work for me since I'm in a different system.

I can help with an H base or put one down, I will be needing about 120H/day. A 10x COL base on ZV-759g will output ~360H/day. Bring me the 89 NE and I will make the AEF in a few days, I can also contribute to INS.

I successfully built a base in Katoa, so that my industries affected by UPF can be built there.🥳


[15-Nov-22 03:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
It really takes luck to build a base there. My materials have been waiting there for half a month.


[15-Nov-22 05:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is anyone interested in this planet? I found that it has just become a chemical planet. The profit of making PG here is very high, and C, H and MG of HRT are very cheap and stable.

I, and I don't plan to build it there for the time being.


[16-Nov-22 08:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
My product line is not suitable for building there, and there are not enough raw materials.


[16-Nov-22 08:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
But I plan to build two more FP bases, so that I have three.


[16-Nov-22 08:39 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I do not, I can arrange one after sorting my rfab production


[16-Nov-22 08:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I have one, but it’s only at 250 area. If someone else ships in more h2o, I’ll expand and run DW forever, but I don’t have capacity for an Etherwind base atm


[16-Nov-22 08:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think Norwick is suitable for producing FIM, and the production capacity of harmonia+demeter is just enough to support a food base.


[16-Nov-22 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
Considering demeter is so far away, it's appropriate to do so.


[16-Nov-22 08:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest problem of Norwick is that there is no agricultural planet as good as promitor and no water planet as good as etherwind nearby.


[16-Nov-22 08:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
This makes it difficult for a person's agricultural base to meet the raw material demand of a completely built food base.


[16-Nov-22 09:07 PM] dehzhas#0000
I don’t have a FP base on Norwick ironically


[16-Nov-22 09:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've transitioned to have Norwick be my FIM focused base, and my other FP planet is heavier on DW- close to ice station alpha and ANT.


[16-Nov-22 09:39 PM] gladeowl#0000
I'm curious what is the preferred RAT/DW setup. Do you guys prefer to have FRM/HYF on the same planet as the FP? Or just ship the crops from a different planet?


[16-Nov-22 09:39 PM] churavis#0000
Repeat after me, specialization specialization and more specialization


[16-Nov-22 09:40 PM] gladeowl#0000
hahaha.. different planets it is.


[16-Nov-22 09:42 PM] churavis#0000
Efficiencies compound, which means that the extra 25% of COGC bonus and the extra 28% from 5 experts becomes an extra 60%


[16-Nov-22 09:44 PM] gladeowl#0000
Harmonia is current RAT/DW for all my planets.
Current plan is to convert all the FRM to HYF and move all the FPs to Norwick.
There's enough water on Harmonia to sustain the HYFs, so I only need to import on Norwick


[16-Nov-22 10:00 PM] exeler#0000
Me, but also don't have plans for it either


[16-Nov-22 11:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the early days of the game, you can produce water, crops and food on a planet at the same time, but with the increase of bases and ships, you need to separate them to get expert bonus and COGC bonus.


[17-Nov-22 12:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
I gave up demeter base, because I urgently need a permit now.Since demeter is a farm, it is easy to rebuild.  To be honest, demeter is too far away for me, and my ship can't take care of so many places, so I can only give him up temporarily.


[17-Nov-22 01:05 AM] allocater#0000

For Demeter, I just run GRN for C on Nascent. I get 200 C a day and only need to send out a ship every few days(Ant-Demeter-Nascent). I wouldn’t try to do something with a faster ratio out there

[17-Nov-22 02:08 PM] allocater#0000
infinite shipping capacity means it can be heavy, like gold or steel, synergy with heph could be chemistry, or high end construction r/a-fabs


[17-Nov-22 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
From my view, I think there's a need for another chemistry and food industry COGC (the food industry thing might just be me though 😄 )


[17-Nov-22 02:13 PM] churavis#0000
We do need another FP planet but no FP product will ever justify TSH, chemistry might


[17-Nov-22 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

[17-Nov-22 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
My long term plan is to remove my FPs from Nike, and turn it into a proper construction planet, using my own EPO. Then I need a HYF planet near Griff (mushrooms are NS only- no water). I have an Ice Station Alpha planet, so my Nike FPs should move to a new planet in ANT-1 or ZV-639... or something nearby.

ZR and BE in AMLs make SIO instead of SI- that's a pretty big change for me


[21-Nov-22 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
NA is required in GL now


[21-Nov-22 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyone with other currencies might want to buy all the cheap SI on the other CXes


[21-Nov-22 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Any SI that costs close to the AL that goes into it should be purchased now, I think.


[21-Nov-22 12:47 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Probably should have removed the EDC MM too


[21-Nov-22 12:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I bought the cheapest 700 SI on ANT, that should last me several months of SEA/CTF production (although I was considering getting into SWF production just to use up my excess before)


[21-Nov-22 12:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
😄


[21-Nov-22 12:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
ooh someone is buying up NA


[21-Nov-22 12:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I just sold my NA to the MM last night


[21-Nov-22 12:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been dumping mine


[21-Nov-22 12:49 PM] churavis#0000
I think I'm just going to not throw it away for now until I see exactly how much is necessary.


[21-Nov-22 12:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
@allocater has quite the stockpile in "CX Storage". I wonder if he wants to reserve that.


[21-Nov-22 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
As you can see. NA prices have skyrocketed!

[21-Nov-22 05:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
ok... that contract in the example is utter trash.


[21-Nov-22 05:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
that's ROI negative


[21-Nov-22 05:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
experienced players will look at that and reject and ignore it


[21-Nov-22 05:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
new players might get trapped spending fuel and capital they don't really have


[21-Nov-22 05:42 PM] dehzhas#0000
I take contracts like that if I am already going that way, but an out and back "exploration" is terrible.


[21-Nov-22 05:42 PM] churavis#0000
That might make it more interesting if there's no guarantee that a contract is worth it and you have to figure out if it is or not before you accept it


[21-Nov-22 05:43 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm mostly worried about the onboarding experience for new players. This game already has really high drop off rates and high COLIQ rates. Not sure how this helps.


[21-Nov-22 05:43 PM] churavis#0000
There are plenty of things that new players can do already that aren't worth it and part of the fun is learning how to determine what is and what isn't


[21-Nov-22 05:44 PM] dehzhas#0000
I would argue "not worth it" and "it hurts your ability to play" are two different things.


[21-Nov-22 05:45 PM] dehzhas#0000
That contract uses up fuel and hence startup capital which is already very tightly constrained. By taking contracts you can easily get yourself stuck.


[21-Nov-22 05:45 PM] churavis#0000
Is it that bad?


[21-Nov-22 05:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
Personally, I think so. I want people to stick around and keep playing, I'm not sure this helps that cause.

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-Nov-22 05:49 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm willing to keep an open mind, but so far all the contracts I have seen examples for are bad choices. This one and the other two dev notes that show them. I have seen no contracts that I would consider beneficial for anyone to take, experienced or new.


[21-Nov-22 05:50 PM] dehzhas#0000
Experienced players will just never do it. New players will just get burned. This doesn't seem like a positive to me.


[21-Nov-22 05:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think we should see them in practice. It’s a great idea on their part to make early play more active. They can tweak rewards as needed

[21-Nov-22 06:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
"reputation points" probably have a value far greater than 2000 CIS.


[21-Nov-22 06:15 PM] dehzhas#0000
Maybe... so far there is no place to use them. They might have some feedback loop built into the contracts where better reputation means better contracts, but outside of that it doesn't seem like it for now.


[21-Nov-22 07:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
With the changes to NA, GL and SI is there going to be a better place to make GL? I was going to extend my Deimos base to make GL for fabs.


[21-Nov-22 07:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
Deimos is fine


[21-Nov-22 07:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
if the formula of GL can be accelerated with NA and SIO, the import tonnage will be greatly increased.


[21-Nov-22 07:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
Correspondingly,  i estimates that the price of AL will rise again.😅


[21-Nov-22 08:10 PM] churavis#0000
We're going to be able to make GL faster with FLX as well


[21-Nov-22 08:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that I should buy back some of my FLX.😅  Who would have thought? It has been idle for more than a month. As soon as I sold it, GL will use it.


[22-Nov-22 10:41 AM] churavis#0000
Is there anyone willing to build a glass metallurgy base on uWU-070A and be the governor while we build up the population? You could also just build a SIO and TAI extraction base.

[24-Nov-22 08:23 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Going to be making more efficient production bases now that i've learned the different bonuses. So i've had a PE production and BDE production with my C production on Harmonia. Planning on making Harmonia straight C production while moving PE to Hephaestus. Is there enough demand to justify the move or is there something else being needed that I could focus efforts into? Also working on a H base in KI-401d as well.


[24-Nov-22 09:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, there's definitely enough demand for PE and BDE that you could dedicate separate planets to each of them.


[24-Nov-22 09:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hopefully someone is helping you fund the H base, don't hesitate to ask


[24-Nov-22 09:40 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Yes the H base is sponsored. And that sounds like a decent course then thanks!


[24-Nov-22 09:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nike is a great choice for construction if you get into that more heavily. And many of us run SME bases on Deimos to smelt metals. The various ores are readily available through the corp so Deimos bases can be pretty easy.


[24-Nov-22 09:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
Eventually, you might want to focus Harmonia as mostly FRMs, to make the most of the limited fertile space out there. But it's common to run incinerators on planet, especially at the start


[24-Nov-22 09:44 AM] rune_242#0000
later in the game you want to have even more specialisation so for instance: only make crops on harmonia and burn them on nascent (resource extraction bonus) or turn them in to RAT on norwick (FP bonus)


[24-Nov-22 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got a full 500/500 base in my ship, plus 10 days of all consumables:

[25-Nov-22 01:37 PM] allocater#0000
not that I know of


[25-Nov-22 03:15 PM] churavis#0000
Do we have any leftover AGS or BPT?


[25-Nov-22 03:33 PM] allocater#0000
no


[25-Nov-22 03:37 PM] churavis#0000
As I recall, didn't Pokter have trouble finding enough inputs and work for it to do despite it being Tech only and letting it degrade to 33%?


[25-Nov-22 03:38 PM] allocater#0000
don't know about the inputs, but nobody was buying the outputs either


[26-Nov-22 10:32 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think I was on vacation when he left, which was sad because he was awesome! Did he leave the game or just OOG?


[26-Nov-22 10:35 AM] churavis#0000
He gave all his stuff away and left his buildings to degrade saying he wasn't going to play for a bit but might come back some day, especially if they start a new universe or add more endgame stuff to do


[28-Nov-22 08:36 PM] sginga#0000
got a new base on hephaestus, is there anything people need manufacturing wise? so far I've got PE and MG lined up

PPF-PSL/PSM  WPL-NL/COT/KV


[28-Nov-22 08:41 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Is it worth it to do MG like that for others? On QJ-650c I only need 2 BMP to feed 20 POL for PG


[28-Nov-22 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000

Yes, on ANT, @40pu


[29-Nov-22 10:31 AM] allocater#0000
I need a non-gov member to build a useless base on Antares 1 b and be governor for 1 term. Base teleport will be provided, the timer on it is 2 days 18h. I pay you 500k.


[29-Nov-22 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send a contract for 1000 too, if you have it.

I also need to build a warehouse so you can accept the materials


[29-Nov-22 02:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have a ship at ANT if that helps

[29-Nov-22 05:17 PM] dehzhas#0000
@allocater I want a base on that planet eventually anyway. Do you have a source of TSH? That's the only reason I haven't so far.


[29-Nov-22 05:22 PM] churavis#0000
If you get me THP then I will make you TSH


[29-Nov-22 10:02 PM] dehzhas#0000
THP... that seems hard to come by too


[30-Nov-22 02:28 AM] allocater#0000
at the moment I am living off of 100 discarded THP from ship building, but I want to build a local production chain for it.


[30-Nov-22 02:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can build more ASM.


[30-Nov-22 02:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
Then replace your fabs factory on deimos with sme.


[30-Nov-22 01:51 PM] _bojidar#0000
Any1 have GAL  to supply? I cant see any1 on sheets about it..


[30-Nov-22 02:13 PM] churavis#0000
If I set up a THS production chain, would anyone buy any?


[30-Nov-22 02:13 PM] churavis#0000
Also, does anyone have excess BER or BE capacity?


[30-Nov-22 02:15 PM] allocater#0000
I build TSH on Ant b to slowly build up the base as population increases. I think population growth will be the limit, not TSH.


[30-Nov-22 02:16 PM] allocater#0000
Even with a stock of 50 TSH you can not spend it, since there are no high-pop TSH planets


[30-Nov-22 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I tend to have a bit of trouble finding BER (and BTS). I usually use up all my BE, but I could spare 12 on Griff right now as I'm transitioning things there. @balbar  runs BE there also and might have extra.


[30-Nov-22 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
I don't need it right now I'm just figuring out how to source it on a regular basis for THP


[30-Nov-22 02:22 PM] churavis#0000
Do you want to entice randos to colonize A1b? We could probably do that if we sold THS on ANT


[30-Nov-22 02:24 PM] allocater#0000
long term yeah, I was thinking offering them on LM otherwise they just colonize other planets! 😄


[30-Nov-22 02:29 PM] churavis#0000
It will probably take me a while to set the production chain up, plus more time to satisfy corp demands first


[30-Nov-22 04:52 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I can help with BE for TSH.  I'm not going to sell heaps because it's hard enough to produce for my own chains, but I could fill that part of a TSH chain


[30-Nov-22 04:53 PM] churavis#0000
How much BE could you provide on a weekly basis?


[30-Nov-22 04:54 PM] jackinabox86#0000
lets figure out how much TSH we need.  I'd be contributing for corp use, not outside sales


[30-Nov-22 04:54 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I assume it's like a steady demand of 10-20 TSH a week


[30-Nov-22 04:57 PM] churavis#0000
I am planning on making enough for outside sales but you don't need to provide all the BE for it


[30-Nov-22 04:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
You want 30 a week?


[30-Nov-22 04:58 PM] churavis#0000
I haven't run specific numbers yet but I'm sure I could use that much


[30-Nov-22 04:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I have it on Griff


[30-Nov-22 04:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
wow, it's pretty cheap on the CX atm


[30-Nov-22 04:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
poor Balbar selling low!


[30-Nov-22 04:59 PM] churavis#0000
I make regular trips from Griff to Nike to ANT


[30-Nov-22 04:59 PM] churavis#0000
That's probably temporary while everyone is stocking up on SI


[30-Nov-22 07:06 PM] balbar#0000
eh, i only made BE because i needed room on griffon. i usually run all the other stuff AML can do 🙂


[30-Nov-22 08:39 PM] churavis#0000
Do you still mine BER?


[30-Nov-22 10:16 PM] balbar#0000
jepp, on SE-648b


[30-Nov-22 10:18 PM] churavis#0000
How much excess BER capacity can you provide? How much room do you have for expansion on SE-648b


[30-Nov-22 10:22 PM] balbar#0000
I'm running 13 extractors, up to about 1,5K BER a week (dont have access to PRUNer right now. Work laptop 🙂 )for more I would need to get and use another permit. Right now I'm providing 1K a week to jackinabox on Griffonstone.


[30-Nov-22 10:24 PM] balbar#0000
my next target would be upgrading my HQ anyway. (and get another ship. H2O from Ice station almost uses up one by itself...)


[30-Nov-22 10:24 PM] churavis#0000
What level are you one, I might have what you need


[30-Nov-22 10:25 PM] balbar#0000
level 10


[30-Nov-22 10:27 PM] balbar#0000
The Rfabs, TRU and MCG should not be a problem. gotta check out where I can get AAR, BWS and BMF from.


[30-Nov-22 10:27 PM] churavis#0000
I've got everything you need for that on Phobos, other's might have it on Nike already


[30-Nov-22 10:28 PM] balbar#0000
I put my HQ on SE-648b right now. the bonus to Extraction, chem and fuel refining is way more helpful to me as I don't do electronics


[30-Nov-22 10:31 PM] balbar#0000
according to the spreadsheet allocator produces the stuff on Phobos. I'll put up the ads over there and for the Rfabs on nike


[30-Nov-22 10:32 PM] churavis#0000
I've got the AAR on Nike already as well as the Rfabs if you want it all in one place


[30-Nov-22 10:34 PM] balbar#0000
nice. I'll still put up the rest of the ads (want to go to 13 in one go) I'll check later what I need for more extractors and put up the ads for that, too


[30-Nov-22 10:35 PM] churavis#0000
I'll do some analysis to make sure I will need more BER


[30-Nov-22 11:43 PM] churavis#0000
OK, I've done the math and in order to produce about 20 TSH per week I would only need 20 BE per week, which  Jackinabox can already provide from his excess capacity, so you won't need to expand your BER production for me at least. That also saves me from having to build any AML


[01-Dec-22 12:16 AM] balbar#0000
alright. still, I will upgrade my HQ anyway.

[05-Dec-22 02:45 AM] allocater#0000
I knew the day would come where a material stays at MM forever due to inflation, but I did not expect it to be SF 😄


[05-Dec-22 02:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
It's not surprising, and even so, it's not very profitable to produce SF now.


[05-Dec-22 02:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
HE3 is probably the most profitable link in the fuel production chain, followed by H and FF.

The development team either chooses to weaken SE's revenue or consider adding new ways to consume funds to recover liquidity. Otherwise, more and more serious inflation will lead to the distortion of the price system, and eventually the industrial chain will serve MM.


[05-Dec-22 11:25 AM] churavis#0000
Is there anyone with extra WEL capacity that could make about 40 THP per week for my TSH production? Jackinabox can provide the BE and I can provide the CF no problem.


[05-Dec-22 12:40 PM] allocater#0000
yeah I can spend 4h of WEL per day to keep a PP4 busy


[05-Dec-22 12:40 PM] allocater#0000
on heph


[05-Dec-22 12:41 PM] allocater#0000
unless you want to keep it deimos local


[05-Dec-22 12:50 PM] churavis#0000
Either one is fine for me, I send ships from Deimos to Nike regularly.


[05-Dec-22 12:56 PM] allocater#0000
I only have WEL on heph and you get get 20 THP to get you started right now! (but I still take the BE and CF to produce them 😄 )


[05-Dec-22 12:58 PM] churavis#0000
I've got 30 CF on Nike just for you


[05-Dec-22 12:58 PM] churavis#0000
Send me contracts for both when you get a chance


[05-Dec-22 01:00 PM] allocater#0000
you are the initiator, you have to send the contracts 😇


[05-Dec-22 01:00 PM] churavis#0000
THP price?


[05-Dec-22 01:01 PM] allocater#0000
if you give CF and BE, it's free


[05-Dec-22 01:01 PM] allocater#0000
for accounting purposes 2500/u I guess


[05-Dec-22 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 3 WEL on Nike now, if they are ever needed


[05-Dec-22 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are probably gonna do a mix of TRU and MHL.


[05-Dec-22 08:34 PM] jackinabox86#0000
honestly, I can just run the THP with my own BE


[05-Dec-22 08:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Happy to let someone else do it, but I have enough TRU and GV supply as it is


[05-Dec-22 09:44 PM] churavis#0000
Do you need CF?


[05-Dec-22 10:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yes

Where are your WEL?

Heph. I can get my BE and everything there. Just need the CF there

HE3 is the hardest one to get a hold of in ANT, before DLR and Earthling quit the game we used to be supplied by Earthling. Now I have a base all the way out on Avalon in the Hortus system to extract TS and convert it to HE3, its annoying but its a source!


[06-Dec-22 12:20 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm thinking of sponsoring a fuel base for a OOG member so that I can start making a surplus and influence the market

Where is the closest HE3 base potential to ANT? Also was looking to eventually establish a fuel base


[06-Dec-22 12:42 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I believe Earthling's extraction base was on a planet in the IY systems, my FIO is down right now or I would tell you which one it was lol. I didn't like its low concentration though so I went further out. Avalon also provides SCR to make Sulfur so I thought I was getting extra value but it turns out no one buys S haha


[06-Dec-22 12:43 PM] churavis#0000
It was in the IY-206 system


[06-Dec-22 07:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
It is not suitable to use TS to produce HE3. Collecting HE3 directly will make a lot of money, although it will seriously occupy the capacity.

I am looking to find a home for all the ALE being produced.
The markets have not been vigorous in purchasing this product, and I have build up a large supply at Antares Station.
So, if you have technicians, and you have not purchased from me for some reason, then reach out to me and let's see if we can find a suitable way to make these work for your supply chain.
I would like to keep this product output flowing and it would be great to have it increase the production speed of corporate products.

AL is also rising very high now, and we also need GL. Can we use aceland as a metallurgical base and support the settler population needed by GF through the pioneer population raised by SME?


[15-Dec-22 01:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
Aceland only needs sea, and it's only one hop from CX.

But I think it's too far away, and industries other than GF can't support enough pioneer population.

I brought up making it metallurgy a few days ago and I guess they use it for construction, not metallurgy. I think it’s stupid, but we haven’t really had a presence there, so it’s tough to take it from those who have built it into their chains

So, I am having trouble getting enough Pioneers on my new Hydrogen base on A2G.
Do you all have suggestions on how to recruit new population?
I have built one new COLlector before the population report, and it did get filled, but that seems like a slow process to do one each week.
There is no governor, and I am reluctant to build an admin center.

It's got 7 bases and 2600 pioneers. It should be getting an okay amount of health from the base count. Like it should get more than 53%, so I'm concerned about the base coutn I have being incorrect.


[16-Dec-22 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
The True happiness on report 54 is 81.65%, so it will drift up from the 74% average happiness that it's reporting now.


[16-Dec-22 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Half an SST of DW is plenty to cover safety. I guess an INF would help a bit with the rest of it.


[16-Dec-22 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
On low pop planets the festivals are suuuper cheap and effective, but you need the ADM / governor for that. (should have lots of governor volunteers now that there are quests for it)


[16-Dec-22 10:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think for COL/EXT/RIG, the building depreciation is low enough to make it worthwhile to just make the building even if it's partially staffed.

I started a HAL extraction base on YK-005d with only 1 other base that isn't expanding and the PIOs are filling in nicely. I built in 2-3 waves rather than 1 EXT at a time. It might just be because it has a low starting pop 🤷‍♂️

[22-Dec-22 02:09 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
sounds dumb but I always try and leave at least a single unit up on the CX as a visual baseline to tease people into aligning their sales with that number. Its a little mind trick and I don't know how much it actually works, but I've noted having zero stock directly translates to inflated pricing

Uhh.. I deleted the order, but I just wanted to fill the space in my 3K / 1K with something useful

switch your WEL to TRU, people keep buying at insane prices


[22-Dec-22 04:51 PM] dehzhas#0000
OMG TRU is soooo rediculous right now


[22-Dec-22 06:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
MAi I saved a long time ago was sold out at 199.🤣


[22-Dec-22 06:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
ANT's crop price is very strange now.


[23-Dec-22 03:21 PM] _bojidar#0000
Any1 can make some HSE?price?


[23-Dec-22 03:22 PM] churavis#0000
Have you checked the sheet?


[23-Dec-22 03:32 PM] _bojidar#0000
yes but dont know if there is any stock of it


[23-Dec-22 03:34 PM] churavis#0000
18 at the moment and plenty of inputs to make more


[23-Dec-22 03:36 PM] _bojidar#0000
ok then. so 25 for a start


[23-Dec-22 03:37 PM] _bojidar#0000
i can take these 18 and 7 more after


[23-Dec-22 03:44 PM] churavis#0000
No problem


[23-Dec-22 07:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have 26 HSE in ant


[24-Dec-22 05:13 AM] domicius#0000
Looks like all the luxury goods are selling out rapidly an ANT. I'm considering whether this is an opportunity to get into those fields!


[24-Dec-22 05:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
which product do you want to produce?😆


[24-Dec-22 05:46 AM] domicius#0000
VIN, LC, and LCs are all going low


[24-Dec-22 05:47 AM] domicius#0000
Of course, other players might be in a better position to do this 🙂


[24-Dec-22 06:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
What are VIN and LC?


[24-Dec-22 08:50 AM] domicius#0000
Zinfandel and lab coats. Needed for scientists


[24-Dec-22 08:51 AM] domicius#0000
And engineers


[24-Dec-22 08:51 AM] domicius#0000
I'll need to invest in a steady supply somehow.


[24-Dec-22 12:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm literally in the middle of a massive expansion to start producing all tier 1 - tier 4 consumables, including the luxury ones. Prices are insane right now.

Good plan


[24-Dec-22 09:13 PM] jackinabox86#0000
anyone do/have BTS anywhere?


[24-Dec-22 09:13 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we're going to need a lot of W for this fancy ship, so I need to source that


[24-Dec-22 09:13 PM] jackinabox86#0000
and I was a moron and didn't just buy it a couple days ago on the CX


[24-Dec-22 09:29 PM] dehzhas#0000
Anyone have TRU available somewhere? I am in dire need of it and the CX is absurdly priced right now.


[24-Dec-22 09:30 PM] dehzhas#0000
I can pay more than the corp price if it helps


[24-Dec-22 10:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just started a BTS base on Aratora. I might have to increase the size if people regularly want BTS. I will ship some to Griff regularly


[24-Dec-22 10:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Haven't worked out my stocks yet, will have to check when I'm back at home in a day or two


[25-Dec-22 08:32 AM] balbar#0000
I have 500BTS on Griffon (sourced from Moria iirc). also 57 W on Deimos if you need some


[25-Dec-22 09:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I will buy all the W and 200 BTS if I can


[25-Dec-22 09:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I bought 100 BTS for 500 on the CX, so that's not fun


[25-Dec-22 09:22 AM] balbar#0000
sure, no problem


[25-Dec-22 09:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
price?


[25-Dec-22 09:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't know how much the stock will need to be, since we seem to have enough to make the W needed for Churavis's ship


[25-Dec-22 09:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
but if more people want fancy ships


[25-Dec-22 09:23 AM] balbar#0000
W is 8k, i think i paid something like 450NCC per BTS?. So I'd say 450/BTS


[27-Dec-22 02:42 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm in search of 98 TRU - TRU seems to be in short supply at the moment. Anyone have some or all of that?


[27-Dec-22 02:43 PM] churavis#0000
Do we need more WEL capacity in the corp?


[27-Dec-22 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
In 6 minutes I'll have 95 TRU on Nike. I switched my WELs over from MHL briefly.


[27-Dec-22 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don' thave a price in mind but feel free to send me a contract for whatever price seems right


[27-Dec-22 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think historically TRU has had a pretty poor profit margin.


[27-Dec-22 03:12 PM] dehzhas#0000
Corp price has been 150 on TRU, but I'll go 300 for these... CX is like 600 at the moment.

{Reactions}
👍 

[27-Dec-22 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
My WELs are mostly just for MHL, and those have always eventually sold for me


[27-Dec-22 03:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
Typically CX has been around 250... it's gone crazy

You'll probably make more per hour by switching to TRU until the market calms down


[27-Dec-22 05:12 PM] exeler#0000
I've got 200 or so TRU sitting around if anyone needs. Let me check where they're at


[27-Dec-22 05:18 PM] exeler#0000
I've got 200 TRU on ANT and 50 on Deimos.


[27-Dec-22 05:18 PM] churavis#0000
Price?


[27-Dec-22 05:19 PM] exeler#0000
200 /u sounds fair?

Contract sent for 100 on ANT


[27-Dec-22 07:06 PM] exeler#0000
I still don't have a Nike base 😅


[28-Dec-22 04:21 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
No viable option around ANT space? I'm currently looking for a 4th base location, seeing as how I got this loan and am doing nothing useful with the money.


[28-Dec-22 04:34 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Question. Has anyone done the math to see how much of what goods we're all producing; how much is sold intra-corp; how much we buy from extra-corp sources; and how much goes to open market?


[28-Dec-22 04:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might be optimal to find out what industries we've a solid chokehold on, and which are still open/viable for expansion - or otherwise low market share - thus viable to push out foreign non-corp competitors who ship in for extra profit from outside markets.


[28-Dec-22 04:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Especially for higher cost/volume goods we don't produce domestically, and rely on.


[28-Dec-22 05:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Would this be the sort of data (total planetary industry, %, type specifics) Governors have access to? Or is total industry numbers on-world/etc just... Something that isn't shown anywhere, and we'd need to manually ask folks in order to know? If there's no actual display of industry numbers for Governors, then that's definitely something worth suggesting to devs. Seems silly to govern a world and not know exactly how many smelters or farms exist to be taxed, or whatever.


[28-Dec-22 06:33 AM] gladeowl#0000
He was being sarcastic. Nike, the Corp HQ, is a construction planet.


[28-Dec-22 06:35 AM] gladeowl#0000
Think we have another one. Aceland, I think.


[28-Dec-22 07:35 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah.


[28-Dec-22 07:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sarcasm via text is inefficient at best.


[28-Dec-22 08:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
Unfortunately governors get very very little information like that. We really only know how much tax income all our planets put together make. We don't have a breakdown planet-by-planet. WE don't have a breakdown of LM fees vs. production fees vs. warehouse fees. You can get decent estimates of some of those by doing things like checking the total number of rented warehouses, or looking at total planetary employment

{Reactions}
😭 

[28-Dec-22 08:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
The devs are aware of the issues and it's somewhere on the todo list.


[28-Dec-22 08:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah, damn.


[28-Dec-22 08:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
As far as looking at individual industries, I'd say it sounds like a fun project, and go for it 😄


[28-Dec-22 08:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure the best way to formally approach that. Anything that moves at a decent rate on the CX and has a high profit margin is probably "viable for expansion". But there's a lot of things that look good/bad on paper that might not be in reality.


[28-Dec-22 08:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Basically there's a lot of nuance that's hard to model in-bulk


[28-Dec-22 08:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
It'll involve a heavy dose of pestering everyone for in-depth data, but in the long run, I hope it'll help us as a corp figure out our strengths and weaknesses - with opportunities for profit and growth in mind. I can't possibly be the only one going "Hm. I'd like a new base, but what's actually needed by the market; by our corpmates; how often; and in what volume?"


[28-Dec-22 08:51 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye. Therein lies the struggle. Some things are hard to model *at all* due to the lack of direct data. Though logically it'd be easier to make decisions based on better data, than no data and pure guesswork.


[28-Dec-22 08:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Too bad PU does not* incorporate accessable API's, or I could create a system that pulls data and compiles it, much like the scripts my faction uses for another game.


[28-Dec-22 08:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, it's really hard to enumerate all the private deals that regularly happen behind the scenes and off the CX. I think the best approach to answer that question for in-corp needs is to check out the #base-sponsoring channel. Each sponsored base represents a in-corp need that is so strong someone wants to pay up front for it 😄

{Reactions}
🤘 

[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Here are those APIs: https://doc.fnar.net/ it's provided by a third party tool named FIO


[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We have market info, but no (far as I can tell) direct-from-player data without the need to constantly ask people to provide said data


[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
I use them pretty extensively


[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oooh


[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah, yeah. I've seen FIO. Market data and all is great, I meant more player-direct data.


[28-Dec-22 08:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like how we have the sheet with "X player runs Y industries on Z planets"


[28-Dec-22 08:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
But no actual numbers on "x per day of y outputs using z inputs"


[28-Dec-22 08:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I guess I could just ask everyone to give me an estimate and work off of that


[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, some corps use FIO that way. You can provide "Groups" and set permissions to share information in different categories: "Flight Data    Building Data    Storage Data    Production Data    Workforce Data    Experts Data    Contract Data    Shipment Tracking" with your group.


[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oooooooh


[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Okay now *that* is what I'm talking about!


[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I could work magic with that.


[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] exeler#0000
FIO should have base numbers (like how many of what building) and probably also production/consumption numbers since it has the burn feature.

{Reactions}
👍 

[28-Dec-22 08:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
But then everyone has to want to make that information shared 😄 also its' a bit of extra setup that I don't really have a sense for how many OOGers use

[28-Dec-22 08:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We have the same type of system for my Torn City faction. Really lets us math things out to boost efficiency


[28-Dec-22 08:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think as a corp we don't want to be in a situation where we're pushing people down certain paths, but there have definitely been people who have asked for that kind of guidance


[28-Dec-22 08:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
(Also lets me write really fun and silly AAR newsletter on a weekly basis breaking down our gains, losses, and interesting notes)

{Reactions}
😁 

[28-Dec-22 08:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Pushing, definitely not. Suggested upon request? Hell yeah. SImply having the opportunity to be educated in our guesstimates is priceless.


[28-Dec-22 09:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If there's some sort of view permissions via the FIO system, that'd likely soothe some grumbles. I totally get the privacy bit as far as API's and player behavior goes. There's a thin line, easily crossed, between surveillance and policing, but OOG doesn't give off police-your-gameplay vibes. Y'all are quite liberal in the player agency sense.


[28-Dec-22 09:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Well, maybe I'll make a FIO group and see how it works


[28-Dec-22 09:01 AM] exeler#0000
I think for newer players having a sense of "the corp needs this, and I can supply that" is great. I know having my first couple of bases be corp oriented like that was cool. 

I think if we want that for new members, we kind of already have that. If a new player says "I have a permit and want to make a base" there's a bunch of us that would probably jump on that to give them something to do with that permit. 

Coordinating that on a corp wide scale might be a fun project, but on an individual basis I think people generally know what kinds of bases they'd want to sponsor if someone asked already.

{Reactions}
💯 

[28-Dec-22 09:02 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye. That's my thought too, as one of the forementioned new players.


[28-Dec-22 09:03 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
My first 3 bases I pretty much went with "what do y'all think I should do". I turned Deimos HQ into an SME->AL base; Harmonia was a FRM sponsorship; and Heph an FP sponsorship. For my 4th base, I want to find my own way. 🙂 And it just makes sense, at least to me, that I need to study real data and make an informed decision. If I'm going to do so anyway, I may as well compile what I learn into a format that others can take advantage of.


[28-Dec-22 09:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
@xenoxerarch  Send me your FIO username and I'll add you too the OOG group

[28-Dec-22 09:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I shared my info with the group on https://fio.fnar.net/settings so at least there should be something in there for people to see


[28-Dec-22 09:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I added the members whose names I recognized out of the list of all users 😄


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll do the same as soon as I register. Just got the FIO plugin for my browser. (Didn't know that was a thing; I've just been using the website itself)


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
ahh cool


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
you will be much happier


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
oh incidentally, your previous company before you did a COLIQ still shows up in FIO


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
heh


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
so hopefully your registration knocks something loose and fixes that issue


[28-Dec-22 09:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I used the same name, so that might get weird. Or fix itself. We'll see.


[28-Dec-22 09:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Once you register you can click "Reset my data" at the top of settings. But I think registering will do that as part of the process


[28-Dec-22 09:16 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. How do I actually join the group?


[28-Dec-22 09:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think I might need to add your FIO username to the list


[28-Dec-22 09:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Which I have now done 😄


[28-Dec-22 09:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
XenoXerarch is my user, account's created and I've produced an API. Do you need it perchance?


[28-Dec-22 09:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm still not seeing any groups on my group list.


[28-Dec-22 09:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
It says I can 'create a group I can share with others', so perhaps there's a link to share on your end?


[28-Dec-22 09:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm, well there's: https://fio.fnar.net/grouphub?Group=18737399-Ooga_Booga_Capital_Management


[28-Dec-22 09:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah I see now.


[28-Dec-22 09:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If I go to 'add user/group' there's a new group dropdown menu.


[28-Dec-22 09:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I added OOG, and you, and it gave me options to flick on data


[28-Dec-22 09:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
All are now active, and transmitting


[28-Dec-22 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
So my understanding is that you can now query that stuff from the API, as long as you authenticate first ( and/or use your auth token )


[28-Dec-22 09:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. My data isn't showing up but yours and Balbar's are


[28-Dec-22 09:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Also, minor peeve, is it possible to re-order the usernames into alphabetical order?


[28-Dec-22 09:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Just to make searches more streamlined 🙂


[28-Dec-22 09:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think if you're actually using it, you'll want to pull it into google docs or something. The grouphub page seems pretty unwieldy already


[28-Dec-22 09:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
As far as getting your information to show up, you need to make sure your browser plugin is submitting it


[28-Dec-22 09:43 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah here we go, its starting to pull my data now


[28-Dec-22 09:43 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Beautiful. Man this is awesome.


[28-Dec-22 09:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye, definitely going to need an excel sheet or two for this


[28-Dec-22 09:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Honestly this is way more convenient than manually pestering every corp member to look things up constantly. Plus it updates, and states hours since last update, which is way better than a one-time infodump. Loving this!


[28-Dec-22 10:12 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh sweet it even shows ships in transit with cargo! Nice!


[31-Dec-22 07:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I installed the FIO client just to see our corporate information. Sounded interesting. But, I can only see @balbar 's information in the group page (from that link from @archielvahr )


[31-Dec-22 07:49 AM] balbar#0000
you have to enable the information sharing, maybe everyone else has it off?


[31-Dec-22 07:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Odd. Mine and @allocater are definitely on. Maybe it needs to be updated daily, ie, open the app? Or it could just be a permissions thing. Did you get added to the group yet?


[31-Dec-22 07:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Err, meant Arch


[31-Dec-22 07:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Not allo


[31-Dec-22 07:51 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Pretty sure you need permissions to see the data, unless a player sets their data to public (which balbar may have done)


[31-Dec-22 07:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
I see that Balbar's information says <1 hour ago


[31-Dec-22 07:51 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Let me log on real quick and see what shows up for me


[31-Dec-22 07:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

[31-Dec-22 07:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I can see it hypothetically being used to counter-deal, but it'd be too much of a hassle for anything lower than major corp vs corp rivalry

A massive portion of the community of another game I play got hacked via a PIO-like script for that exact reason, so I've already seen it happen. Some salty asshole decided he wasn't cool/rich/strong enough and screwed the entire community for lulz. Hence, I avoid letting anyone know I'm accessing them. Much harder to be targeted if no one knows you can be 😛

How do people generally optimise C production? H2O from Etherwind -> FRM on Harmonia -> INC on Nascent? My C production isn't keeping up and prices aren't great.

[10-Jan-23 12:15 AM] exeler#0000
If you need volume, go with HYF and HCP. 

I'm swapping to HCP in HYF on Harmonia with GRN and MAI done in FRM on Demeter. 

My INC are on Harmonia right now running the fast recipe, but hoping to move them to Nascent soon to squeeze more out of my HYF and have more of them.


[10-Jan-23 12:19 AM] domicius#0000
I've only got 2 INC but I use the fast recipe burns GRN, MAI, HCP. Makes 24 C per day, needs 3-4 FRM full time  to provide the raw materials. I guess it scales from there. Using HYF would make sense on a dedicated basis though, as you get twice the HCP at half the area.


[10-Jan-23 12:21 AM] exeler#0000
Twice the HCP, faster time, and half the area. It's more than 4x the amount of HCP per area.


[10-Jan-23 12:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think you can keep switching production formulas by obtaining GRN, HCP and MAI cheaply, so that you can make a higher profit.


[10-Jan-23 12:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
What do y'all usually buy GRN/MAI @ ? I can switch my Harm FRM production to those if you need, at whatever corp price is.


[10-Jan-23 01:23 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
That's how I usually do it. I am able to supply 10 INC's on Nascent burning the fast recipe off Harmonia. But both Etherwind and Harmonia are 3/3 bases. I added Demeter in my loop now, so I can add 10 more INC's on Nascent soon. 

With the fast recipe I do the maximum amount, so I need to transport things there only once every 5 days. 800 HCP, 400 GRN, 400 MAI. 

In the future I'll switch FRM from Harmonia to HYF but that's a bit long way off.


[10-Jan-23 01:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can purchase your GRN/RCO on harmonia if you like .


[10-Jan-23 01:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
But in fact, the producer of C is the bottomless pit that consumes crops, more crops and faster formula.😆

[10-Jan-23 01:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
32 INCs using this formula are enough for you to supply the whole C market of ANT.

[10-Jan-23 01:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
Compared with the number of crops it burns and the capacity of ships it used, the profit is not high.


[10-Jan-23 01:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, that's on par with CHP-CL production in terms of profit. Really figured y'all would earn more than that for the sheer volume of crap you need to supply the industry.


[10-Jan-23 01:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
C's production is not profitable. Some people do it because the threshold is low. Many of us do it to hedge the risk of CX out of stock and ensure a certain supply.


[10-Jan-23 01:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
I need very little C now, so I totally rely on purchasing.

[10-Jan-23 02:35 AM] allocater#0000
I do slow recipe MAI->C now, because crop price is so high that "destroying" 4 crops to be faster, is less profitable.


[10-Jan-23 02:45 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Interesting that, in this peculiar case, fast doesn't quite equal efficient/optimal.


[10-Jan-23 02:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I've got 60 RCO atm if you want it. Whatever the usual price is works for me. I'll be producing MAI for the next few days for Allocator, then switching to MAI/GRN split to help feed all of y'alls voracious black hole C plants 🙂


[10-Jan-23 02:59 AM] yuen8241#0000
sent the contract 🤝


[10-Jan-23 03:23 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
Maybe I've been doing things wrong. But isn't it quite profitable if you make the crops (and water) for them yourself. Plus have a self-sustaining setup for RAT and DW? Pretty much my only expenses are OVE and PWO, and the repair materials.


[10-Jan-23 03:42 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
There is the opportunity cost of using that same area for something more profitable


[10-Jan-23 09:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if you're using your own inputs, you're likely losing profits using the fast recipe

{Reactions}
👆 

[10-Jan-23 09:53 AM] jackinabox86#0000
because the FRM input needed is so large; you can make more C cheaper with less farms just burning slow


[10-Jan-23 09:55 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I have Demeter as all FRMs doing GRN and Nascent burning them and get 200 C a day


[10-Jan-23 09:55 AM] jackinabox86#0000
from 1000 area, and minimal water


[10-Jan-23 10:03 AM] allocater#0000
you might be better off selling 4 crops and 4 C slowly, instead of selling 4 C faster, but I haven't done deep math on it

Like raw material inventory management, production ratio and so on?


[10-Jan-23 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
It is an annoying and difficult chain. You need a lot of buildings, and if you balanced everything just for the production of one item, you'd never be able to sell that quantity... so you have to skip around to keep the buildings working.


[10-Jan-23 08:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems as I thought before.


[10-Jan-23 08:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I run an ECA + ELP to build LFEs, but they can't keep the building busy all the time, so I've been adding production of other things. Figured I could use the extra ELP time to make BMFs or AARs. The AARs weren't too bad except for the kevlar.


[10-Jan-23 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
SE is too simple. But now I want to make something new.


[10-Jan-23 08:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I  have a lot of extra SI and LI, so I can use that for interesting things. But the plastic cases for a lot of those parts has been an annoyance.

Don't make something like AWF which are only used in prestige buildings

Oh no, they are in crew modules too I guess, nevermind.


[10-Jan-23 08:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
Great, it seems that I can purchase some SI and LI, otherwise I have to build two SME bases myself.


[10-Jan-23 08:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been making a ton of ROMs, and hoping to make Weak AIs. But I'll need to add an SE, SL, and SD for that.


[10-Jan-23 08:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
and for the ratios to work out... probably multiple SDs

What do you mean by proper list?


[10-Jan-23 08:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, we have 'XenoXerarch 20 SME Deimos; 12 FRM/4RIG Harmonia" etc on a line, for each corp member, but what about an actual 'sheet has x number of total SMEs; there are x number of corp SME's on Deimos; thus x percent of all corp SME's are on planets a b and c;" and so forth


[10-Jan-23 08:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm not knowledgeable enough in excel to know how to pull all that


[10-Jan-23 08:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I could do it manually but I'm sure its possible to do it properly in the sheet itself somehow


[10-Jan-23 08:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm, I think that's pretty close to the first sheet, except if you read down by the columns instead of across the rows


[10-Jan-23 08:52 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[10-Jan-23 08:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm. I'm trying to think of how you could summarize it in a useful way.


[10-Jan-23 08:54 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Once it involves more than 1 vertical/horizonal line, I dunno how the fuck to pull it off


[10-Jan-23 08:54 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
like I don't even understand how you got the price finder to work mechanically


[10-Jan-23 08:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess you could add up all the buildings and know there's 78 rigs and 115 FRMs on harmonia, but I'm not sure if that's actionable


[10-Jan-23 08:55 PM] archielvahr#0000

[11-Jan-23 03:54 AM] dehzhas#0000
No way he sells at that price? 100+ H2O means 100++ DW? Same with other H2O input things. That kills profitability on H2O derivatives and only people who have a reliable source outside the CX will be able to net profit on those things.


[11-Jan-23 03:55 AM] dehzhas#0000

[11-Jan-23 01:22 PM] dehzhas#0000
I've been thinking of upgrading the warehouses on the following planets:


[11-Jan-23 01:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
* Ice Station Alpha
* Nascent
* Harmonia
* Norwick

I'd like all of them to at least be 3 units deep to help with my logistics. Any objections to buying in-corp fabs for that purpose?

[11-Jan-23 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think every other upgrade increases the number of units you can rent, and the cost increases every other upgrade as well. Not sure on the numbers though.


[11-Jan-23 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
But definitely a good use in my opinion


[11-Jan-23 01:46 PM] churavis#0000
Every other upgrade that doesn't increase the max units per player increases the maximum number of players that can rent units.

@xenoxerarch What are you smelting on Deimos? maybe you could put your price information on the corp spreadsheet at some time. I am looking to pick up ALuminum if you have it available

Damn PE exploding in price again


[12-Jan-23 08:33 PM] churavis#0000
Do we not have enough producers in corp?


[12-Jan-23 08:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have about 100k PE in stock


[12-Jan-23 08:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe we should sponsor a new manufacturer of C-AL-PE.


[12-Jan-23 08:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I use 11k a day and produce 6k a day


[12-Jan-23 08:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
but I'll buy whatever is available atm


[12-Jan-23 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
A BMP can produce 1k PE a day.


[12-Jan-23 08:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yes, I have 6 of them


[12-Jan-23 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have 8


[12-Jan-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
But I don't always produce PE.


[12-Jan-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
Why do you consume so much PE? Are you making INS?


[12-Jan-23 08:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
BCO

WU-070a just added 463 settlers on it's POPR. If anyone needs a metallurgy planet for glass, glass forge products, silicon, silicon ore, tantalite or any other metallurgy, now is a great time to do it as the population is exploding.

Let me know if you're coming so we can continue the settler immigration programs for you.

Because it's the martian faction and they needed to spread out two well know martian names over multiple systems

Let me know how many SET you'll be employing


[13-Jan-23 08:29 PM] churavis#0000
We'll probably get another 500 SET total so if you can't employ that much let me know so I can build something


[13-Jan-23 08:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
500, more is better.

@churavis


[13-Jan-23 08:47 PM] churavis#0000
Aeper already has enough so go ahead and build more than 500 jobs if you want


[13-Jan-23 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
I noticed that there is still a shortage of 400 SET.

apparently the waterbuyer has 4 EDC bases and makes 2mil per day

and then pumps all money into water buying 😄

yeah they are so bored they came up with the water shenanigans 😄


[15-Jan-23 03:12 PM] mrtcsmith#0000

so, collectively we just need to sell 45k H2O a day to overcome that


[15-Jan-23 06:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
I estimate that his daily income is around 1.2 million. If he keeps buying water, he can only buy 26k a day.


[15-Jan-23 06:31 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don’t know how he’ll ever sell it all


[15-Jan-23 06:31 PM] churavis#0000
He probably doesn't plan on selling it all


[15-Jan-23 06:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
There’s virtually nothing in this game in high, consistent demand that you can corner without people easily ramping supply


[15-Jan-23 06:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It’s a good thing

However, in reality, there are also some rich people who have inherited the inheritance who squander money and buy some useless things. I think it is similar to this situation.


[15-Jan-23 07:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looking at the dev's accounts, I don't think they're really at the point where they're making MM or really interacting with players who make MM stuff: http://kortham.homeip.net/files/chrome_2023-01-15_19-39-44.png

[15-Jan-23 07:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
So they probably don't see it as a very relevant problem especially since they are (understandably and probably rightly) focused on new player experience and new player drop off rates


[15-Jan-23 07:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
None of them even participated in electronics.


[15-Jan-23 07:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
It would probably be best for them to be playing on secret accounts that no one knows is a dev account, but I'm not sure if that's the case


[15-Jan-23 07:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
It may be better to experience the game with an ordinary account


[15-Jan-23 07:46 PM] churavis#0000
Maybe their secret account is in our corp too?


[15-Jan-23 07:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
It is possible, because every time the development team rewards the ship, it is delivered in heph.😆


[15-Jan-23 07:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
Heph's biggest ship manufacturer is us, right?


[15-Jan-23 07:49 PM] churavis#0000

We got 463 new settlers last time, we'll likely get more this time


[16-Jan-23 11:19 AM] allocater#0000
if this 45 water keeps going we can set up a pipeline, 30 for the producer, 15 for the transporter


[16-Jan-23 01:54 PM] dehzhas#0000
It's hard to setup a great pipeline because it's a bit unpredictable. I can easily sell through the 45/u at any given time so you may not always be able to move all the water you have at 45/u


[16-Jan-23 01:55 PM] allocater#0000
That's what I thought too, but I keep destroying the wall, and he keeps putting it up, I think I dumped 50k so far


[16-Jan-23 01:55 PM] dehzhas#0000
Also... I suspect there are a lot of people ramping H2O production right now so there will be increasing competition for that 45/u


[16-Jan-23 01:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
It is hard to predict when we will fully sell through his capacity to buy it up at that price.


[16-Jan-23 01:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
He's definitely not expanding his income while doing this.


[16-Jan-23 01:57 PM] allocater#0000
if he makes 2mil per day with 5 EDC bases, this will be his daily buying power 😄


[16-Jan-23 01:57 PM] dehzhas#0000
across all exchanges


[16-Jan-23 01:58 PM] churavis#0000
The longer this goes on the more people are going to build water bases to take advantage of the easy money.

If I were him and trying to troll as hard as possible without caring about money then I'd wait until everyone built a ton of water bases and then dump all my water all at once at lower than cost prices

{Reactions}
💯 

[16-Jan-23 01:58 PM] allocater#0000
yeah, hortus is not up atm and benten and moria are weak, AIC seems his strongest currency


[16-Jan-23 01:59 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, I'm trying to avoid responding to this by building up more H2O capacity. The 45/u is nice and I sell a few thousand here and there, but I don't want to be left holding the H2O bag when he has his "lol, gotcha" moment.


[16-Jan-23 02:01 PM] churavis#0000
Even if he can only maintain the price on Antares, traders will ensure that it doesn't go too low elsewhere.


[16-Jan-23 02:03 PM] dehzhas#0000
Once we all out produce his ability to purchase, he may just dump the massive H2O at stupid low prices, crashing the market. This would give him some of the capital back while his EDC production stays at 2 mil/day. Then he can turn around once that is gone and do it again with even more capital to back it up.


[16-Jan-23 02:03 PM] dehzhas#0000
... until he gets tired of doing it


[16-Jan-23 02:04 PM] allocater#0000
I don't think he can crash water below 20, because if he does, I will buy like 1 million for 20 million 😄


[16-Jan-23 02:05 PM] churavis#0000
How much water could be have by now?


[16-Jan-23 02:05 PM] allocater#0000
on the CX it's 325k + maybe 100k in backup


[16-Jan-23 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
doesn't he hide the water in expensive ~~buy ~~ sell orders?


[16-Jan-23 02:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
True, if you have tons of capital, you can just purchase when he sells low and sell when he buys high and instantly kill the strat.


[16-Jan-23 02:06 PM] dehzhas#0000
I imagine he will have at least a million before he runs out of capital to keep it up


[16-Jan-23 02:06 PM] churavis#0000
He could hide an infinite amount in overflow contracts, indefinitely and without cost


[16-Jan-23 02:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
interesting


[16-Jan-23 02:07 PM] allocater#0000
at least the upper bound is the volume on the CX graph


[16-Jan-23 02:09 PM] allocater#0000
also I wonder about his FIM reserve and if we could sabotage EDC production by inflating FIM prices


[16-Jan-23 02:10 PM] dehzhas#0000
There is a limit to the number of contracts for a single MAT and limit to the size on the CX I think... so that is a max across all exchanges. But then... the CX warehouse is maximum of 1000 units * 500 or a total of 2,500,000 per CX


[16-Jan-23 02:10 PM] churavis#0000
That would only work until traders arrive and he's not likely to run out before then


[16-Jan-23 02:11 PM] dehzhas#0000
I think the upper bound he could store is roughly 3 million per CX.


[16-Jan-23 02:12 PM] churavis#0000
What about overflow contracts?


[16-Jan-23 02:12 PM] allocater#0000
what happens if you buy water, CX warehouse is full and there are already max H2O overflow contracts?


[16-Jan-23 02:12 PM] dehzhas#0000
I don't know if there is a limit to overflow contracts


[16-Jan-23 02:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
I give it 50/50 there is a limit there


[16-Jan-23 02:13 PM] dehzhas#0000
The devs have put limits on the CX for most things, but that one would be easy to overlook


[16-Jan-23 02:13 PM] allocater#0000
to the modder discord and have someone sell 1 unit , 1000 times into overflow 😄


[16-Jan-23 02:14 PM] dehzhas#0000
I am really curious to test it out now


[16-Jan-23 02:15 PM] dehzhas#0000

A 500-area EDC base has a daily profit of 360,000, and it seems that it only has four EDC bases.


[16-Jan-23 06:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have studied it, and it is true that he has five EDC bases, but one of them is definitely not full, and the others may not be full.


[16-Jan-23 09:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems like no one is buying the water Allocater and I have at 48/u. So that's all moved off the exchange, I guess.

Is a WCB ship enough to maintain these four bases?


[19-Jan-23 09:10 PM] churavis#0000
The burnables will be too much for the WCB\


[19-Jan-23 09:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
If LCB is used, the total investment will be too high.


[19-Jan-23 09:12 PM] churavis#0000
You might be able to get away with it if you can get a few noobs to do shipments for you


[19-Jan-23 11:10 PM] exeler#0000
I'll tell you in about a week. I've got a ship set to build a base on Nascent that gives me essentially this


[19-Jan-23 11:11 PM] exeler#0000
Well, assuming you don't need the AL to actually leave Deimos 😅 

I eat most of my own AL on Deimos and ship the the excess and the PE from Heph to Nike


[19-Jan-23 11:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
This is my sponsorship plan. I have built three ORCs on harmonia. Obviously, I can't do MAI there.


[19-Jan-23 11:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
I really need AL and TI, but my license is very short.


[19-Jan-23 11:18 PM] dehzhas#0000
Does anyone produce TA by any chance?


[19-Jan-23 11:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
You want to produce SC? You can ask people with AML if they can produce this. I estimate that your demand is not great.


[19-Jan-23 11:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
No, I don't need a huge amount of it, just a few a week to keep up with demand.


[19-Jan-23 11:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
I estimate that you will only buy 10-20 at a time.

[19-Jan-23 11:22 PM] dehzhas#0000
@churavis sells TAI on CX, so I'm guessing I can borrow and AML for a little time each week for someone to turn that into TA.


[19-Jan-23 11:22 PM] dehzhas#0000
Who has an AML they would be willing to let me use?


[19-Jan-23 11:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
Looks like I need about 300 hours of production time per week


[19-Jan-23 11:23 PM] churavis#0000
I mine TAI on WU-070A so you can buy the TAI I have for cheap


[19-Jan-23 11:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
An AML take about four days to produce 10 TA , so only people with rich AML capacity can help you.


[19-Jan-23 11:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
The market of sc is very small. Is it necessary to include this in your consumable business?


[19-Jan-23 11:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
I produce a lot of these things at one time and transport them to CX to sell them slowly.


[19-Jan-23 11:25 PM] churavis#0000
Actually, I think DLR has some TA leftover on Phobos that you could have


[19-Jan-23 11:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
If your consumables subscription service even includes such things as SC, you should charge them more money, otherwise the money you earn will be sorry for your efforts in managing complex supply chain and logistics.😅


[19-Jan-23 11:27 PM] dehzhas#0000
How do I get that?


[19-Jan-23 11:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, I don't really make much money on the SC, but it is part of the complete offering of all tier 1-4 consumables.


[19-Jan-23 11:31 PM] churavis#0000
Send DLR a contract for 107, 1 AIC, quick before he falls asleep


[19-Jan-23 11:31 PM] churavis#0000
On Phobos


[19-Jan-23 11:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
100 TA is enough for him for several months.


[19-Jan-23 11:38 PM] churavis#0000
DLR isn't using it


[19-Jan-23 11:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
He can even monopolize all CX business.🥳


[19-Jan-23 11:38 PM] churavis#0000
Did you want some?


[19-Jan-23 11:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter, I will build my own AML, and I also produce TAI.


[19-Jan-23 11:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
Contract for 107 TA sent to @bitcoin_ape


[20-Jan-23 06:23 PM] churavis#0000

It seems that phobos has provided us with a lot of taxes.


[30-Jan-23 12:15 AM] churavis#0000
Not enough, I'm about to upgrade some infrastructure, how much should I raise the taxes by?


[30-Jan-23 12:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
1440😋


[30-Jan-23 12:40 AM] churavis#0000
1,440 percent?


[30-Jan-23 12:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
Only the taxes of ENG and SCI can be raised to 1440.


[30-Jan-23 11:38 AM] gladeowl#0000
Can I buy 100-200 units of three different crops enough for a RAT recipe on ANT or Harmonia? 
Trying to create a buffer before I build the Norwick base so my Harmonia production can catch up.
*can do Norwick as well but the pickup would be delayed till the base goes up and as the Warehouse doesn't have the cap to handle this amount of crops*


[30-Jan-23 01:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have loads of MUS and MAI on Harmonia, feel free to send ads of up to 200 @ 100/u. I don't have extra NUT/VEG though


[30-Jan-23 05:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
why is Nascent the C smelting planet and not Antares I b? Lots closer to Harmonia/Phobos


[30-Jan-23 05:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's running Chem right now, but Antares ii d is also running Chem, albeit a bit more expensive to construct


[30-Jan-23 05:20 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Nascent is resource extraction


[30-Jan-23 05:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, isn't it used mostly for INCs though?


[30-Jan-23 05:20 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
INC is a resource extraction building


[30-Jan-23 05:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
but it's so far away


[30-Jan-23 05:20 PM] churavis#0000
Nascent doesn't need TSH


[30-Jan-23 05:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
and you shouldn't really be farming on Phobos


[30-Jan-23 05:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
agreed, just a point for those who might need the extra land and not want to make the trek


[30-Jan-23 05:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
true, but the fuel over time + time itself


[30-Jan-23 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
feel like it'd make up for it eventually


[30-Jan-23 05:22 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
With an upgraded starter ship, you only need to make the trip from Harmonia every 1-2 weeks I think it is


[30-Jan-23 05:22 PM] churavis#0000
You also have to pay more TSH every time you need to repair and that adds up to more than the extra fuel/ship capacity


[30-Jan-23 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah I see


[30-Jan-23 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
Nascent is on the way back from Demeter anyways and that's where I grow all my burnables


[30-Jan-23 05:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
makes sense, okay


[30-Jan-23 05:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Its only a few jumps from Harmonia, that's only half a day usually


[30-Jan-23 08:04 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I use Nascent because it works well with Demeter


[30-Jan-23 08:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
long ago, the corp sponsored a few free farming bases on Demeter, so it's been a foundation of the C chain for a lot of us for a while


[30-Jan-23 08:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
I got it with a loan, and then I tore it down.


[30-Jan-23 08:47 PM] yuen8241#0000

Confirmed not a SE troll. I don't think EDC farming is a terrible idea... I'm just philosophically opposed to it. And I hope that market makers get changed in some way such that they provide a utility, but not an objective.


[01-Feb-23 03:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, I also produce EDC, and I am also a market maker. I just think EDC is too strong and too simple, and it lacks fun. I hope the development team will weaken it quickly.

[01-Feb-23 06:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
As I said when I invited him to join discord, he needed to offer some products below the market price in exchange.


[01-Feb-23 11:34 PM] domicius#0000
MMs are also a way of making sure that some complicated goods remain expensive, by setting a minimum floor. However they need to be more dynamic by eg responding to how many players have SE in the game.


[01-Feb-23 11:35 PM] domicius#0000
Agreed on new players. We're all here to offer each other a competitive source of goods and the ability to work together, rather than just an internal market.


[02-Feb-23 12:19 AM] evov#0000
I'm not looking for "corp" prices, discounted goods, loans or favors. To be honest, I'm wary of most internal markets or walled gardens as I feel like they can end up being more restrictive than beneficial in the long run. I buy some things, I sell some things, and I feel like there's often a net benefit to be found when interacting with people directly. If it's helpful to anyone, I'll work on putting together a more detailed list of my production capacities in case anyone might have a need of something I can provide.


[02-Feb-23 12:28 AM] churavis#0000
Late game players are constrained by area and managerial capacity but have plenty of capital. Early game players are constrained by capital but have plenty of excess area and managerial capacity. Corp prices, loans, grants and sponsored bases allow early and late game players to trade what the have in abundance for what they are constrained by.

You play how you want but our system is extremely effective at optimizing strengths and weaknesses for maximum growth.


[02-Feb-23 02:33 AM] allocater#0000
Don't be afraid of adjusting your offers to the market prices. For example C is now ~500. Discounts offers are entirely voluntary. Benefit is volume, regularity and simplicity.


[02-Feb-23 02:36 AM] allocater#0000
I am currently trying to move a lot of the ship-chain to and through the CX


[02-Feb-23 04:29 AM] domicius#0000
I think Corp members should offer, at a minimum, at the bid price.


[02-Feb-23 04:30 AM] domicius#0000
I mean, the benefit of being in a Corp is being with other people - a social reward. Funding for new bases, advice on what to do, and a lot of  trust too.

This thing is in short supply.


[03-Feb-23 02:32 AM] rune_242#0000
in 3d9h I'll have another 100 BDE


[03-Feb-23 02:53 AM] domicius#0000
I'll be honest. I change my prices whenever I feel the need to. Of course, since I make most of my money on SE I don't care if I make money on other stuff.


[03-Feb-23 02:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't produce BDE, I adjust my purchase price. I think it is reasonable to adjust the company's price according to market changes, especially those products that sell well in the market.


[03-Feb-23 04:06 AM] domicius#0000
The real thing, where you buy inputs, you need to adjust prices. There's no way around it. Also, with consumable prices rising clearly one has to be able to afford upkeep and building maintenance. Hell, I've built 3 bases just to save myself the cost of buying B, L and R fabs.


[03-Feb-23 04:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
My fabs raw materials are basically bought.


[03-Feb-23 04:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
My metal production capacity is not enough to support my shipbuilding and construction industry.


[03-Feb-23 04:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't even produce C, and my EPO and PG are basically purchased.


[03-Feb-23 04:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
So inflation will obviously affect my cost on these products.


[03-Feb-23 08:57 AM] exeler#0000

I've been making it on Heph, just waiting on my next Heph->Nike shipment.

That means it will be worth nothing


[03-Feb-23 10:39 AM] churavis#0000
You should sell everything to me for a million/u, then I'll sell it all back to you for the same price and your base will be worth millions

I will buy 500 SEA at Nike.  Sending contract


[03-Feb-23 11:20 AM] hernanduer#0000

[03-Feb-23 12:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
We should sell ship components back and forth to pump up the CX prices. That's not against the rules, is it? There's no tax on CX transactions so it's free


[03-Feb-23 12:37 PM] churavis#0000
That only works if no one else is selling them


[05-Feb-23 04:30 PM] legosfreak#0000

[06-Feb-23 06:26 AM] rune_242#0000
awesome


[06-Feb-23 06:27 AM] rune_242#0000
can I sell it directly on your POL base?


[06-Feb-23 06:27 AM] rune_242#0000
saves you the hastle of shipping 3k H


[06-Feb-23 06:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
My four chemical bases need H to varying degrees, but none of them can use 3k.


[06-Feb-23 06:34 AM] yuen8241#0000
I usually mix H and C and transport them by LCB.


[06-Feb-23 06:34 AM] yuen8241#0000
It will be more convenient for you to sell it to me at ANT


[06-Feb-23 06:35 AM] neth_havoc#0000
ANT would be fine for me, too. 😉


[06-Feb-23 06:35 AM] rune_242#0000
if you need it on elon or hephaestus I can sell you any amount any time


[06-Feb-23 06:35 AM] rune_242#0000
I keep large stocks on those planets


[06-Feb-23 06:36 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Griffonstone


[06-Feb-23 06:36 AM] rune_242#0000
that's fine too


[06-Feb-23 06:36 AM] rune_242#0000
I have 3k at 60/u


[06-Feb-23 06:37 AM] rune_242#0000
you can send me a contract any time you need some


[06-Feb-23 06:37 AM] neth_havoc#0000
On Griffonstone?


[06-Feb-23 06:37 AM] rune_242#0000
yup


[06-Feb-23 06:38 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Ohh, that's nice. Was difficult to aquire some on CX.


[06-Feb-23 06:38 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Will send a contract when I'm home.


[06-Feb-23 08:46 AM] neth_havoc#0000
At how much % should I repair buildings? How do you handle it?


[06-Feb-23 08:49 AM] rune_242#0000
I do it at around 95 percent


[06-Feb-23 09:07 AM] domicius#0000
At 80%.  There is no effect on efficiency before that. Should be about once every 3months I believe


[06-Feb-23 09:08 AM] neth_havoc#0000
So the same as with ships?


[06-Feb-23 09:23 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah. I'm not sure its official, but when I started playing a year+ ago, that was what the devs said.


[06-Feb-23 09:24 AM] domicius#0000
I don't believe it's changed


[06-Feb-23 09:26 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't know how much of your production has been claimed, but I'm happy to buy large amounts at Elon anytime


[06-Feb-23 09:47 AM] rune_242#0000
I'm sending 3k tonight
would like a piece of that?


[06-Feb-23 09:48 AM] rune_242#0000
and in 3h you can buy 1k


[06-Feb-23 09:49 AM] rune_242#0000
doesn't every bit of degradation slow down your production?


[06-Feb-23 10:02 AM] domicius#0000
Apparently not? Let me see what I can find.

this building has a 8 percent higher production line condition so a 8 percent better overall efficiency


[06-Feb-23 11:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah unlike ships, building condition is a continuous reduction. There's a minimum of 33% efficiency though

Day 89 is a good strategy for repairs if you're really min-maxing thing


[06-Feb-23 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
because of the way rounding works, there's usually a sweet spot in repair cost price at day 89:

although that chart varies a bit depending on the building (and if it's using SEA or BL or one of those other materials)


[06-Feb-23 12:51 PM] allocater#0000
I plotted APF cost per production day for each repair interval and it also came up at ~90days as minimum.

red is consumable cost; blue is repair costs


[06-Feb-23 12:51 PM] allocater#0000
if you have something with cheap consumables you can actually just let it decay to 33% and keep it there, it's the cheapest operation costs.


[06-Feb-23 01:34 PM] churavis#0000
You also have to consider the area cost as you'd need 3 times as much area to produce the same amount as a fully maintained operation.

Yeah, 1k or whatever H on Elon would be great

Don't we need to keep inviting new players to join? Considering that there are many retired players.


[06-Feb-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
A PRO player who has played in ANT for 160 days is still willing to join Corp. Are there many such people?


[06-Feb-23 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am willing to provide sponsorship and WCB upgrade package to find a Ti supplier that I can't find.😅


[06-Feb-23 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
Or I can continue to upgrade my HQ and let me do all these things myself.

[08-Feb-23 03:29 PM] allocater#0000
can the oog sheet access "live" FIO data like the gov sheets?


[08-Feb-23 03:39 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
They probably could if they don't already, just use the Rain CSV endpoints that are available which are for getting data into spreadsheets


[08-Feb-23 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
The OOG sheets that I made aren't live due to scripting issues and the fact that they'd potentially make a ton of requests. My sheets occasionally get me rate-limited from FIO. I could look into something there. (specifically I'm talking about the player activity sheet and the PlanetTracker sheet, which I occasionally copy the values over into)


[08-Feb-23 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can definitely give it a try and see how it shakes out


[08-Feb-23 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also have an intermediate sheet to do some cleanup form bad data in FIO (regarding players who have left OOG or had their accounts deleted, etc)


[08-Feb-23 05:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Would anyone be interested in another Manufacturing planet? Probably in one ANT 1 or 2 on one of the unused more expensive planets?


[08-Feb-23 06:39 PM] erklein#0000
I am. I was thinking it would be nice to have another in the region.


[08-Feb-23 06:41 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah I can really only fit another SPF with no space for more supporting manufacturing or having to use another permit for only 250 area, another base would be better for growth overall


[08-Feb-23 06:42 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I expect it would be expensive to do but I have some cash to burn


[08-Feb-23 06:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Half my new Phobos base is manufacturing too


[08-Feb-23 06:44 PM] erklein#0000
I also make BWS/BMF so with help with the lfabs, it wouldn't be too hard to set up a COG and ADM somewhere

[08-Feb-23 06:52 PM] erklein#0000
I think I would like YK-005d. It needs INS, but it's close to Norwick for comsumables and Nascent for C for a variety of good BMP stuff


[08-Feb-23 06:56 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I'm using that planet for my HAL extraction base


[08-Feb-23 07:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
The best manufacturing planet must be near ANT.

{Reactions}
💯 

[08-Feb-23 07:31 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yes, I think that ZV-307e might be best, there is ZV-759j but it's quite far out


[08-Feb-23 07:34 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
and if TSH is included that brings in ZV-759a and a planet in the same system as the two Metallurgy planets might be beneficial


[08-Feb-23 07:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think ZV-759a is better for electronics, and it can produce a large number of electronic basic materials through CLR.

{Reactions}
👍 

[08-Feb-23 07:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
CU/AU/SI produced by metallurgical planet can be transported to electronic planet faster, and the population level required by CLR is not particularly high.


[08-Feb-23 07:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
Higher construction cost of electronics base can prevent SE farmers from coming here to take advantage.


[08-Feb-23 07:49 PM] churavis#0000
We already have an electronics planet at home


[08-Feb-23 07:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
But it can save some space occupied by factories such as SD/EDM that don't need engineers and scientists.


[08-Feb-23 07:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
In this case, I only need to keep buildings such as SE, SL and DRS in phobos, and some necessary supporting buildings. The low-end electronics factory serving high-end manufacturing industry can not occupy phobos space, which is equivalent to saving a permit.


[08-Feb-23 07:59 PM] yuen8241#0000
In this case, we will have two electronic planets near AL , and MOR people will be jealous of us.

{Reactions}
💯 

[08-Feb-23 08:00 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
This is the primary reason we should do anything, make other players jealous


[08-Feb-23 08:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that some MOR players often laugh at ANT, it makes me feel very happy to make them jealous.😆


[08-Feb-23 08:04 PM] churavis#0000
Personally I depend on having a puddle jumper do regular trips between my electronics and manufacturing base


[08-Feb-23 08:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
The ANT1 and ANT2 systems can have two manufacturing planets, two electronics planets, two chemical planets and two metallurgical planets with the improvement of our infrastructure construction capacity. What a great industrial cluster!


[08-Feb-23 08:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, but these two planets need to invest more permits. It would be great if I could save them.


[08-Feb-23 08:10 PM] exeler#0000
If rate limiting is the only issue, we could set up an intermediary cache for the data we need so we don't have to reach out to fio every time someone loads the sheet.


[08-Feb-23 08:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, not sure how to control that intermediary cache (except by copy pasting out the values). Google docs will recalculate hidden sheets when the workbook is open even if you're not looking at them, presumably any time something accesses it. There is some caching somewhere, maybe I'll google around and see if I can figure out how that works


[08-Feb-23 11:51 PM] dehzhas#0000
So... I'm going to move my HQ out of ANT space. I'm still dedicated to ANT as ever, but:

Insitor Cooperative: 3% bonus on agriculture, 2% on food industries

which is like... almost all of my bases get an instant boost across the board.


[08-Feb-23 11:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
So all your bases have buildings like FRM or FP？😅


[09-Feb-23 01:23 AM] allocater#0000

[11-Feb-23 03:46 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I'm going to start a new Manufacturing planet on Ant 1e. I will build the COGC, ADM, WAR, LM and SST, INF and PAR. I will also run for gov. I don't think it will need pop past techs, there is plenty of profitable manufacturing that could be moved there to free up space on Heph.

[11-Feb-23 07:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
What if we transform ANT1-A into an electronic planet, so that the ANT system has two electronic planets and two manufacturing planets, which is very convenient to form industrial synergy?


[11-Feb-23 07:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that the profit of Electronics Planet is very high, TSH is worthwhile as an input.


[11-Feb-23 08:07 AM] allocater#0000
Is there an interest among governors to create in-game spin-off corps for clearer planet and tax management?


[11-Feb-23 08:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think it is more convenient for subsidiaries to calculate taxes and costs. At the same time, it can ensure that dividends are used for active members. We can help new members through loans and sponsorship.


[11-Feb-23 08:13 AM] balbar#0000
I don't mind either way. SE-648b is not really that demanding though 😅


[11-Feb-23 08:13 AM] yuen8241#0000
Subsidiaries need to reflect the relevance of OOG through their names, such as OOG-deimos management company. And the governor needs to report the tax situation every week.


[11-Feb-23 08:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
Everyone can join the head office to enjoy HQ bonus.


[11-Feb-23 08:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now, the biggest source of tax revenue is phobos, so it depends on whether Churavis is interested.


[11-Feb-23 08:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Personally, I think the tax should be collected by the governor, who can pay the bank or directly sponsor the members.


[11-Feb-23 08:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, we will no longer worry that inactive members will take up dividends.


[11-Feb-23 08:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
The only trouble is that the governor will lose the HQ bonus, or they will build a new one. The good news is that if we can operate steadily, the governor can pass on the subsidiary to the next person when he retires.

[11-Feb-23 08:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
Judging from our current strength, this cost is not high.


[11-Feb-23 08:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering the high cost and income of Phobos, having a subsidiary to do independent accounting will help us adjust the tax level and maintain a balance.


[11-Feb-23 08:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
Griffstone may also face this problem, where the high-end population and cost are also higher.


[11-Feb-23 08:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't think it's worth investing in HQ for this low-tax and low-cost planet.😆


[11-Feb-23 09:04 AM] churavis#0000
The problem with subsidiary corporations is that you'd lose your HQ bonus on Nike


[11-Feb-23 09:05 AM] churavis#0000
That bonus is far more valuable to me than any tax money


[11-Feb-23 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've thought about spin-off corps in the past. I would love to know how much each planet is actually bringing in. My previous concern was inactive members taking away from the "upkeep money". But that hasn't been as much of a problem lately since people have been better about leaving the corp. Ultimately, I don't think it's worth the hassle, especially if you're planning on creating HQs for each governor (or even some of them). Governorships can be fluid, and change frequently. It should be handled as an in-game feature, like separate wallets for tax income... and I think that was/is an intended feature


[12-Feb-23 05:07 PM] dehzhas#0000
It would be nice to have more direct funding for the cost of Griffonstone, but I'm not super tied to it.


[12-Feb-23 05:08 PM] dehzhas#0000
I get less of a boost from the HQ on Nike than most because of my industry there. I think mostly, if I can source Griff stuff at corp prices I think I am good.


[12-Feb-23 05:09 PM] dehzhas#0000
Speaking of which, does anyone have OFF and SUN for purchase? I put ads up on Heph per the spreadsheet but got not bites.


[12-Feb-23 06:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd be cool with the corp making some direct payments to the govs of the highest-cost planet governors


[12-Feb-23 06:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
Except ANT, the Corp to which the governor of the tax-collecting planet belongs is usually only one person.


[12-Feb-23 06:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
Individual planets are two people. Etherwind is an exception, but it is basically tax-free.


[12-Feb-23 06:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
Even RiseofFilth, now he is alone in the Corp.


[12-Feb-23 07:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
I don't quite believe that except the governor of FIO, none of the other governors belong to Corp


[12-Feb-23 07:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
Obviously, they also think it is convenient to calculate the costs and benefits. As for whether the surplus tax is paid to Corp or whether the insufficient loss is made up by Corp, it can be easily done after accounting.


[12-Feb-23 07:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now our weekly tax revenue is 2.1 million, and there will be more in the future. If we divest the main tax sources to subsidiaries, it will be easier to recruit members later, and Corp can accommodate more people.


[12-Feb-23 07:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'll throw UTS and OFF into the griff in a few hours.


[12-Feb-23 09:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000

If you can't beat them, join them. To defeat EDC bases, we have to build EDC bases to drive up the price of R-fabs and FIM. If we can't drive up the price, we make profit, if we can do it, EDC bases will decline. win-win 😄

If ANT1-E becomes a manufacturing planet, will anyone go to ANT1-A with me to turn it into an electronics planet? We can save a permit of Phobos.

TSH is hard to get compared to HSE etc, supply would need to be increased.

This is the case with electronics, but it is difficult to sell except MM.


[15-Feb-23 01:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
ANT1-A is so close to CX and Heph that we can just keep buildings such as SE and SL on phobos.


[15-Feb-23 01:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, the income of each of our members in phobos will be greatly improved.

[15-Feb-23 01:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the case of not affecting the shipbuilding industry and high-end manufacturing industry, it will earn an additional daily profit of about 300k.


[15-Feb-23 01:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
Our transportation path becomes ANT1-A to heph and then to Phobos, which is closer and smaller in tonnage and suitable for STL ship transportation.


[15-Feb-23 01:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
If we raise the tax rate of electronic engineers in phobos to 1440, we will have a greater advantage than others.


[15-Feb-23 01:26 AM] allocater#0000
it will take some time to build up pop on Anta. Electronics requires almost no shipping so it can be on any MCG planet further away. But next to CX is also nice.


[15-Feb-23 01:29 AM] allocater#0000
Are there really only 4 electronics planets in the universe?


[15-Feb-23 01:31 AM] allocater#0000
ABH production is better than TSH, but if ABH inputs are missing, TSH is a good fallback. So we could first build up PP~~3~~4 on Nike for it. Then we can settle the 2 hot planets Anta and Antb


[15-Feb-23 01:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that the low-end products of electronics need heavy things such as CU as raw materials, it is beneficial to be close to CX or ANT2 system


[15-Feb-23 01:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
TSH needs PP4.

[15-Feb-23 01:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
In addition, if the construction cost of electronics base is too low, there will definitely be SE farmers coming here to take advantage.

[15-Feb-23 01:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
If the electronic planet like phobos is under our control, as long as we charge the heaviest tax and take up enough engineers, we will also make a lot of money.


[15-Feb-23 01:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
With the money earned, we can build more ships or invest in more bases to enhance the strength of Corp


[15-Feb-23 01:50 AM] allocater#0000
I still have to produce it. If you are in a hurry I have to delist ADS on CX


[15-Feb-23 01:51 AM] allocater#0000
Malahat will overtake Phobos as best electronics planet soon

The best SE planet. It's still a little far from AL and CX.


[15-Feb-23 01:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
If we build a new electronic planet in ANT to accommodate non-MM buildings, phobos will be better than it.


[15-Feb-23 01:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, each of us can leave a permit to build SE and SL in phobos, and then it's hard to believe that ANT and even the whole universe will have a Corp that is richer than us.


[15-Feb-23 02:01 AM] allocater#0000
so if someone wants to produce the TSH for this expansion, they can collect 250k per day, otherwise that will go to the Moria TSH seller:

Self-production


[15-Feb-23 02:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
Only CF, HE and BE are needed.


[15-Feb-23 02:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
All three products can be produced internally by Corp


[15-Feb-23 02:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering the slow growth of population and the difficulty in selling Afabs, it is acceptable to produce TSH by ourselves.


[15-Feb-23 02:15 AM] allocater#0000
1 WEL is enough to supply the base, I am sure we have that on deimos


[15-Feb-23 02:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have started to switch to producing CF, and when I have enough CF and BE, I will start producing THP.


[15-Feb-23 02:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
The demand for TSH is not large, because electronic buildings occupy a large area, and a base needs about 20 TSH.


[15-Feb-23 03:29 AM] rune_242#0000
I am planning building 2 more PP4's next week


[15-Feb-23 03:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
Can you maintain it? Four PP4 are very raw material consuming. The market of TSH is not big either. Our production rate is faster than the population growth rate.


[15-Feb-23 03:39 AM] rune_242#0000
I think I can
I've just build a base on elon with 20 POL (2 more coming)
and I'll use part of the TSH for building a base ant 1b
that will be filled with CHP/LAB


[15-Feb-23 03:39 AM] rune_242#0000
I already have 1000 CHEM space and another 1000 is coming


[15-Feb-23 03:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
If your base focuses on construction and chemical industry, it should be no problem.


[15-Feb-23 08:24 AM] churavis#0000

[16-Feb-23 09:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
We hope to have two electronic planets, two manufacturing planets and one chemical planet in the ANT system at the same time.


[16-Feb-23 09:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, we can turn metals and other products shipped from ANT2 system and other places into ships, high-end electronic products and high-end manufacturing products here.


[16-Feb-23 09:08 PM] jackinabox86#0000
what's the additional manufacturing planet?


[16-Feb-23 09:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
A1E


[16-Feb-23 09:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
hmm.  I could use more PE production.  My 6 BMPs on Heph are not enough


[16-Feb-23 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
I hope A1A will become an electronic planet to build CLR, ELP and so on. So phobos can only keep SE, DRS and SL.


[16-Feb-23 09:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
If each of us can own a SE farm in phobos without hindering the production of other products, we can build more infrastructure in phobos and make a profit from it.


[16-Feb-23 09:12 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah, I'm developing A1E for manufacturing


[16-Feb-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
Malahat's EDC output value is getting larger and larger, and phobos' financial position in the universe has been seriously weakened. If we don't participate in EDC, we will lose money in maintaining phobos, and our profits will be eroded by EDC produced by others.


[16-Feb-23 09:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think many of us don't mind owning an SE farm in phobos if we can not affect shipbuilding and other industries, especially since we have been paying so much for phobos' engineer population.


[16-Feb-23 09:15 PM] churavis#0000
EDC demand is constant, how does Malahat EDC producer's erode our profits?


[16-Feb-23 09:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
The inflation brought by EDC has expanded wildly with the continuous development of malahat.


[16-Feb-23 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now many MOR people start to sell EDC in other CX. As long as you don't participate in the upstream industry of EDC, your profits will be eroded by the EDC they shipped.


[16-Feb-23 09:26 PM] churavis#0000
The price of EDC stays the same regardless of how much is sold


[16-Feb-23 09:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
During this time, people have been buying EDC in MOR, and it is obvious that MOR's inflation will spill over to other places.


[16-Feb-23 09:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
The profit of EDC has been decreasing, and the cost recovery cycle is very long, but the profit is still higher than that of most industries.


[16-Feb-23 09:38 PM] churavis#0000
What do you mean the income is decreasing if the price has remained the same?

[16-Feb-23 09:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
profit


[16-Feb-23 09:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
Because the upstream products of EDC are all increasing in price.


[16-Feb-23 09:49 PM] churavis#0000
EDC doesn't have upstream products besides consumables, which are easy to vertically integrate, and fabs which are only needed every 3 months


[16-Feb-23 09:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
At present, the daily income of a 500-area SE farm is about 300k . If 10 people have such a farm in phobos, the daily profit will be enough to maintain the happiness of phobos population at 100% within 30 days.


[16-Feb-23 09:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
So the upstream products I am talking about are Rfabs and consumables. These things are all rising in price because of EDC. If you don't participate in EDC or these related industries, your profits will be eroded by the inflation they bring.


[16-Feb-23 09:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
Just like when discharging water, the closer you are to the water source, the more water you get.


[16-Feb-23 09:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
Simple MM economy is very boring, but if we just build such a farm to hedge inflation, I think it is no problem.


[16-Feb-23 09:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
If A1A becomes an electronics planet, people who already own the electronics industry chain will not have a big change in operation because of the relocation of buildings such as CLR, but they can save a permit for SE farms.


[17-Feb-23 02:06 AM] allocater#0000
each EDC base is printing ~40 million over its lifetime (80-100d). That money is distributed among the FIM, R-fab industry and the base operator. Atm, FIM takes 30%, R-fabs take 20%, and the EDC base operator takes 50%. A tax of 1440 would take about 5%.


[17-Feb-23 02:09 AM] allocater#0000
as R-fabs and FIM increase they will take more of the pie, but if one person operates all himself, they always will keep all of the 40mil pie


[17-Feb-23 02:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
The difference between MM products and other products is that it will generate new money, which will lead to the devaluation of the money of non-MM products producers and suffer losses under the new wealth distribution pattern.


[17-Feb-23 02:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
MM is the printing press, and whoever has mastered the faucet will be richer.


[17-Feb-23 02:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now, because ANT has only one electronic planet phobos, we choose high-end electronics between finance and high-end electronics, but if there are two electronic planets, we can have them all.


[17-Feb-23 02:17 AM] allocater#0000
all other industries can and should adjust prices to inflation until they have the same profit as the EDC chain


[17-Feb-23 02:18 AM] allocater#0000
but that may take a while


[17-Feb-23 02:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, this adjustment is gradual. In this process, people who master the faucet or are close to it have accumulated far more wealth than others.


[17-Feb-23 02:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
The money can be used to buy a boat or build a new base, or sponsor others.


[17-Feb-23 02:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
It means that we can use other people's products to make ourselves stronger and have a higher ecological niche in the whole universe.


[17-Feb-23 02:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that MM can become ICA or CIS, it is more advantageous to buy products from other CX at a lower price.


[17-Feb-23 02:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
do we have any unmet KV needs? I'm looking to setup a Griff base for DDT+TCL then Heph for KV.


[17-Feb-23 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
I make slightly more TCL and slightly more KV than I need for my own ADE production

[17-Feb-23 02:20 PM] hernanduer#0000

[17-Feb-23 02:33 PM] allocater#0000
at the moment it's better to sell TCL and buy the KV, because that production step is somehow negative: https://universallogistics.app/building/WPL

market on TCL is non-existent though

How is the in-corp water production looking?
My next expansion will increase the consumption of it to ~1500/d on Harmonia (~600/d) and Norwick (~900/d).
Can I expect a steady supply of this amount, *either from one person or split between multiple* or do I need to plan a Water base of my own?


[20-Feb-23 07:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
You'd better build one yourself.


[20-Feb-23 07:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
Few people have extra capacity to meet such a large demand.


[20-Feb-23 07:17 AM] gladeowl#0000
Assumed as much. Will have to plan out an ISA or Etherwind base. Main concern is just shipping it.


[20-Feb-23 07:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you are concentrated in ANT area, ISA is better than etherwind.


[20-Feb-23 09:36 AM] zipatsu#0000
If you can figure out a way to transport it I can easily cover ~1500/d from ISA


[20-Feb-23 10:14 AM] gladeowl#0000
Sadly, shipping is the main concern. But I'll most likely come back to you once I have the means for it.

[20-Feb-23 10:22 AM] allocater#0000
I think there is enough water on etherwind for 20/u, so if you are willing to pay that and can get the shipping, you don't need a base


[21-Feb-23 12:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
Looking for ~10 WIN


[21-Feb-23 02:17 AM] erklein#0000
I think I have 20 on Norwick. I’ll check later


[21-Feb-23 09:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
How is COGC's voting right calculated? If PIO is 1, what are SET, TEC, ENG and SCI respectively?


[21-Feb-23 09:56 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Isn't it just 1 per pop?


[21-Feb-23 09:58 PM] erklein#0000
PIO is 1, SET is 1.25, TEC is 1.5, and I think it continues to scale to 1.75 for ENG and 2 for SCI


[21-Feb-23 10:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
Does anyone want to go to A1A with me to build an electronics base?


[21-Feb-23 10:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
My own TSH is enough, and I am producing TSH at the same time. On average, a base only needs 20. I need a companion to ensure COGC's voting rights. I can pay to build and maintain the infrastructure of technicians.


[22-Feb-23 01:10 AM] allocater#0000
I will, just have to demolish phobos from 750 to 500


[22-Feb-23 01:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
I've sent my boat, and I'm ready to start upgrading the infrastructure and the planet project.


[22-Feb-23 01:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
I only need 10 BWS and 5 HAB now.


[22-Feb-23 02:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
When this base is built, I can draw two permit from phobos.😆

Does the fio api have the cogc upkeep data?

If so, a bot that posts reminders should be pretty easy to set up.


[22-Feb-23 01:52 PM] churavis#0000
COGC upkeep is every 10 days, right?


[22-Feb-23 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I actually don't see it in FIO. The planet payload has a "COGCUpkeep" array, but it seems empty...?


[22-Feb-23 02:59 PM] churavis#0000
Maybe we just set a calendar notification?

looks like we have no LI production. I would buy 1000 per week @ 1000/u


[24-Feb-23 03:39 AM] habix3956#0000
KI-439b ?


[24-Feb-23 03:41 AM] habix3956#0000
7 clicks from ANT, but got both LIO and HAL on planet


[24-Feb-23 03:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
I will go there to build a base in a while, but my LI is only for my own use.


[24-Feb-23 03:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
There is no metallurgical planet near this planet, so it is too far to transport HAL and LIO to deimos or WU.


[24-Feb-23 03:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there is a metallurgical planet nearby, we can produce a huge amount of LI.


[24-Feb-23 03:50 AM] habix3956#0000
deimos is only planet in ANT with metallurgy as far as I know


[24-Feb-23 03:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
Deimos, A2B and Wu-070a are all metallurgical planets, and I have bases on these three planets, otherwise, my metal is simply not enough.


[24-Feb-23 03:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
Deimos produces FET and Ti, A2B produces CU, AU, SI and BCO, and WU produces GL and RG.


[24-Feb-23 03:53 AM] habix3956#0000
I put KI-439b into prunner... it's hardly profitable


[24-Feb-23 03:53 AM] habix3956#0000
either with EXT only or with EXT+SME


[24-Feb-23 03:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can purchase STL and FE and AL in large quantities from CX or Corp


[24-Feb-23 03:53 AM] habix3956#0000
almost 60 day payback in both cases


[24-Feb-23 03:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
This planet is not suitable for beginners.


[24-Feb-23 03:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to build HAL+LIO base there. You can't transport its products without enough ships.


[24-Feb-23 03:56 AM] yuen8241#0000

The planet has an LM so you might be able to buy the extra you need

also you could even import the missing ore since you will fly there always empty


[24-Feb-23 11:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
also, adjusting the experts there to 3-3, you can get 1 more SME and an extra 1k profit/d

[24-Feb-23 11:36 AM] archielvahr#0000

[01-Mar-23 01:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that my gameplay is more worry-free. Mass production of consumables and then hoarding. Trade in the form of contract only includes bulk commodities and does not include small-scale products.


[01-Mar-23 01:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
I hoard all consumables in ANT, and only need a 2k boat to replenish all bases once every half month.

Excess consumables can be sold in cx, and insufficient consumables can also be replenished in cx.

After lots of thought, I have decided to step away from PrUn for a while. I'm in a season of life where I am having trouble with consistent game interactions and hit an inflection point where I need to spend a lot more time to grow to the next level, and I just don't have the time. I still really love this game and plan on coming back at some point, but the season of life I am in just doesn't allow it at the moment.

I am not going way immediately since I have lots of contracts that still need to be fulfilled and an outstanding loan I need to pay off, but after I take care of those things, I will step away from the game for a bit.

Also, someone will need to take over Griff governor for me.

I just gotta say... prices are insane on consumables these days. I have been trying to simplify my life and just purchase some of them instead of keeping up with the logistics... but wow... almost everything is as high as I have ever seen it or higher. COF is 845!! RAT is 144! BFabs for repairs are at MM prices... it's insane.


[17-Mar-23 02:32 AM] dehzhas#0000
Finishing out my contracts is going to be expensive.


[17-Mar-23 03:15 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah. It's nuts.

Inflation is real


[17-Mar-23 06:17 PM] gl4ucon#0000
do we need more cl?


[17-Mar-23 06:31 PM] churavis#0000
Yes


[18-Mar-23 02:19 AM] gl4ucon#0000
well could i get people intrested in starting/ taking over a new chem planet next to griff?


[18-Mar-23 02:21 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
ZV-307b, ZV-759d and Elon are all chem planets, you need another one?


[18-Mar-23 02:23 AM] gl4ucon#0000
well i need one close to it, where we can move the hal to


[18-Mar-23 02:51 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I get my HAL from yk-005d to supply EPO bases on 307b and 759d


[18-Mar-23 02:52 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Do you have an upgraded starter ship?


[18-Mar-23 05:05 AM] gl4ucon#0000
yes


[24-Mar-23 03:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
how's our SD/SE/SL production? Are you missing any WAI or SNM @allocater or others?


[24-Mar-23 03:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
or DA or something


[24-Mar-23 03:52 PM] allocater#0000
domicius is covering all software so far


[24-Mar-23 03:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
hmm okay, just trying to figure out any middle steps we're missing


[24-Mar-23 03:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
or could use more of

I know ASM stuff

I have some SNM and WAI regularly.


[24-Mar-23 07:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I assume that base setup will require a lot of AL imported. Seems like AL is a little tough to get in corp


[24-Mar-23 08:42 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah even ALO is hard to get, the CX is nearly out or all out most of the time recently


[24-Mar-23 08:43 PM] exeler#0000
#notsorry


[24-Mar-23 09:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was thinking of making a dedicated Nascent ALO base too


[24-Mar-23 09:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
mostly because I have no plan of making a C base


[24-Mar-23 09:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
also it's only 17/d AL

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Mar-23 09:22 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I have an excess of about 10AL/day at Deimos at the moment


[24-Mar-23 09:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
And I could scale that up to 17/day if you need an AL supplier


[24-Mar-23 09:26 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Hmm, actually I'm at 16/day right now, so I could almost cover you completely as is


[24-Mar-23 09:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh great, that'd work for a while. I'll probably set this base up in the next couple days


[24-Mar-23 09:34 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ok, I'll be happy to sell you AL at say, 480/u.  Saves me shipping it to the CX


[24-Mar-23 09:38 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Hadn't seen how high the ALO price was getting.  With a minor reconfig I can boost my excess of both AL and ALO


[24-Mar-23 09:43 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ok, I now have an excess of 25 AL/day and 27 ALO/day


[24-Mar-23 09:46 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Hernanduer has dibs on 17 AL/day, but if anyone else needs AL at Deimos, there is 8/day available


[24-Mar-23 11:50 PM] habix3956#0000
Need 317 ALO/day


[24-Mar-23 11:51 PM] churavis#0000
Come to Nascent, you can mine ALO and burn C with a COGC bonus all day long


[24-Mar-23 11:51 PM] habix3956#0000
Think I'll do just that.. I don't have enough agriculture for C, but I'll spam the planet with EXT


[24-Mar-23 11:52 PM] churavis#0000
I have 3 EXT and with full Experts its enough to support my 10 SME on Deimos

[25-Mar-23 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 30 FAL right now on Deimos. But I've got two weeks or more of CTF to make, so that'll be it for a while


[25-Mar-23 02:52 PM] churavis#0000
Can I get some of that? Price?

Should we set a minimum activity level? For example, should players whose activity drops to C, D, E, and F still stay in Corp and enjoy dividends?


[25-Mar-23 11:21 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, we should


[25-Mar-23 11:23 PM] yuen8241#0000
We now have seven members whose activity has dropped to D or below.

Well reading about it, I think we should go for it. Somethin' for us to do... which we sort of are running out of anyway. I assume we'll build it on Nike?


[27-Mar-23 04:22 PM] churavis#0000
Afabs are going to get even more expensive


[27-Mar-23 04:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've got a few hundred TRU queued up, I'll do the 100 ASE, 10 ATA, and I will have about 50 ADE in a few days. I've got 4 CBL and 26 SP


[27-Mar-23 04:23 PM] gl4ucon#0000
do you need rse?


[27-Mar-23 04:23 PM] churavis#0000
I can do whatever Afabs you can't


[27-Mar-23 04:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can fill those TRU on my next ship from ANT

If I can get some NE I can make the LIT on Deimos


[27-Mar-23 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't make any glass products, so I can't do ATA normally. Likewise with the LIT. DEC has always seemed very slow


[27-Mar-23 04:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have spare POL capacity so I can make start making some DEC too

{Reactions}
🎉 

[27-Mar-23 04:34 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can probably make them all in 3-4 days. Good timing as I was preparing to drop some POL for more LABs.


[27-Mar-23 04:40 PM] churavis#0000
ATA and ADE isn't a problem for me but ABH is doing my to be limited by NR


[27-Mar-23 04:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
That is just a lab time problem? I have some NCS, I will fit some in between TCL


[27-Mar-23 04:44 PM] churavis#0000
I have plenty of NCS, but EPO is an issue as well as lab time


[27-Mar-23 04:47 PM] gl4ucon#0000
how much epo?


[27-Mar-23 04:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Calc tells me 100 ABH is 6250 EPO


[27-Mar-23 04:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
for the NR


[27-Mar-23 04:55 PM] gl4ucon#0000
i mean i could do at least halve and given enough time all of it


[27-Mar-23 04:55 PM] gl4ucon#0000
how quickly do you need the epo?


[27-Mar-23 04:59 PM] churavis#0000
Give me a day and I'll run some numbers when I've got some time


[27-Mar-23 05:05 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can supply the remaining EPO needs


[27-Mar-23 05:16 PM] churavis#0000
If you have the lab capacity then I'd rather have you just make NR for me or other Afab producers


[27-Mar-23 05:16 PM] churavis#0000
Let me know if you need more NCS


[27-Mar-23 05:18 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
EPO and NR are different buildings and I have CLR to make NCS so I can contribute to it all


[27-Mar-23 05:19 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I lack SI for my CLR to make anything else right now to it works out


[27-Mar-23 05:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Once the DEC is done, I will put up my planned 5 more lab


[27-Mar-23 08:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
What is this thing for?


[27-Mar-23 08:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
Where will the donated money eventually go?


[27-Mar-23 08:25 PM] churavis#0000
It's a prestige money sink, there's a leader board for the corp that can burn the most money


[27-Mar-23 08:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
There seems to be no new mechanism, just a prestigious building.

I'm still upgrading my HQ. If this building proves to be valuable, I am willing to donate Afabs.


[27-Mar-23 08:32 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
It's valuable at proving how good you are at a game, surely that is enough?


[27-Mar-23 08:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
I plan to build 22 bases. Considering that I need to pay an extra permit for phobos and heph, I need to upgrade HQ to level 23.😄


[28-Mar-23 01:26 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Has anyone considered Pyrgos and CH-115a for consumable production?  A bit far out but they make a very good pair


[28-Mar-23 05:00 AM] domicius#0000
Interesting. I'm thinking of going into WIN production. The prices are nuts


[28-Mar-23 08:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
It's interesting that no one bought WIN when I sold it before.


[28-Mar-23 08:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
This combination is suitable for ORC+FER.


[28-Mar-23 10:31 AM] domicius#0000
I think software and AFabs have taken off, driving consumption. I mean, I don't think it's a massive market or anything, but prices are 20kpu right now, and the market is all empty.


[28-Mar-23 10:32 AM] domicius#0000
I say that, but of course now you're selling 100 bottles at 21kpu on ANT

Looks like the APEX Representation Center has kicked off a big buying spree on afabs... I suspect we have a couple weeks before that change even becomes live.


[28-Mar-23 07:38 PM] churavis#0000
We should be able to make enough on our own


[28-Mar-23 10:33 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That's what I was thinking


[29-Mar-23 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems like I produce 160 units of BTS per day, out of the universe wide production of about 350 BTS per day


[29-Mar-23 02:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
true power 😄


[29-Mar-23 02:18 PM] churavis#0000

it's on a 24 hour rolling average. so starting now, at 29-Mar-23 02:19 PM I'll turn it off, then in 48 hours, I'll turn it back on.


[29-Mar-23 02:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
It seems I also have a decent chunk of LES production. maybe 25%?


[29-Mar-23 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000

Sir_Dep is getting swamped with IRL stuff and thus is unable to continue with the game. I'm in a similar boat and will be following in his footsteps.

Bye - hope things work out. BTW I took some of  Feb and March off, and just left things running. The bases are quite resilient and not much happens if you then want to come back and reactivate. And we'll be here to help when you do come back.

It's a good idea to store all consumables in the warehouse, or you can just demolish all the buildings. After all, there is no residual value after a long time.

I finally managed to balance the production capacity of most industries.


[30-Mar-23 11:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
For example, NR and EPO needed by the construction industry, CL needed by the chemical industry, and various electronics and manufacturing products needed by the shipbuilding industry.


[30-Mar-23 11:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
BE,CUO,ALO,AUO,SIO,TiO, FE,STL,AL,Ti, C,H2O, these are the things I need to import in large quantities.


[30-Mar-23 11:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
Others are either surplus in production capacity or I can purchase in small quantities to meet the demand.

For example, I'm already in the process of making all the LIT. It's not ready yet but I don't want someone else to start making it too as then it would be wasted

In this case, I have five bases in ANT1 and three in ANT2.😄

Do you need anymore puddlejumpers?


[31-Mar-23 10:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to build some FTL boats, which is more flexible.


[31-Mar-23 11:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
For example, A2B, A2D and deimos either have no industrial chain relationship, or the products are too heavy. It is difficult for SCB-STL ships to transport these products.


[31-Mar-23 11:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
My products need to be transported from A2B or deimos to heph or A1A, and then to Aceland. Obviously, FTL has more advantages.


[31-Mar-23 11:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
I keep an STL for transporting electronic products and plastics between heph, phobos, A1A and A1E, which are particularly light.


[31-Mar-23 11:23 PM] erklein#0000
There's also ZV-639d. One jump from ANT


[31-Mar-23 11:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
This base can also produce n with RIG.😆


[31-Mar-23 11:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems more helpful for me to exchange 400 PG for 60 N every day.😆

I am about to build a new base somewhere but I don't know what industry I should choose


[01-Apr-23 09:16 AM] rune_242#0000
any ideas?


[01-Apr-23 09:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
To build an A2B base to help us produce more metals. Or build a mining base for CUO, LIO, HAL and so on.


[01-Apr-23 09:22 AM] rune_242#0000

[01-Apr-23 09:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you like chemical industry, you can build a POL base to produce PG for us. This thing is too scarce recently.


[01-Apr-23 09:23 AM] rune_242#0000

Now that we are in charge of our own affairs, you can purchase parts and assemble them yourself.

It shouldn't be too expensive, at least it's cheaper than buying it from CX.


[01-Apr-23 09:24 AM] rune_242#0000

There are only 17 vacancies in deimos. If you don't have a deimos base, consider building one in advance.


[02-Apr-23 06:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
People other than ANT like to build a base in deimos first when coming to ANT.

[06-Apr-23 12:12 PM] exeler#0000
I've been thinking about how I could make a feature for the bot that might help us there. 

I was thinking about adding a "bundle" buy/sell feature. So list out a collection of things you need in specific volumes and then people can grab/bid on the things they supply easily. 

Could be handy for both ship building and buying bulk construction mats for a new base. Although construction materials are generally easy to come by with just an LM order on #🚧nike-hq


[06-Apr-23 12:17 PM] domicius#0000
Hmm. It could be a blender, like CX. I can put my needs or my haves. And then it tells me who to send stuff to if I have stuff to sell.


[06-Apr-23 12:17 PM] domicius#0000
Mainly the bot needs to have location tho.

I know some folks were looking for LIO.  I anyone wants, I've been buying 1000 a week from Sango for months, so he'll be able to sell to anyone who needs it.  I bought it at Deimos, but I assume he'd ship to ANT

[08-Apr-23 05:27 AM] domicius#0000
I have a suggestion. If you have stuff on the CX you are selling, but you would also sell in Corp, then put up a small amount at the Corp price, but add a "1" in front of the price. So for example, I'll sell MCG at 18 in Corp, so I've put 100 on sale for 118.  If you need MCG on ANT and you see I have the price, send me an ask at 18pu. Hope this makes sense.

I'm speculating on the function of the APEX representation center based on the last few blog posts:

There are several mentions to "APEX representation center level"- as in discrete levels. But we do know it's a place that you just throw money into.

One line is: "Instead, I extended the existing mechanism to contribute materials and also allow monetary contributions."

Which implies we need to 1) Build the center with a bunch of fabs 2) throw money into it 3) Upgrade the level of it (also using fabs? Or just with money?)


[17-Apr-23 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000

I'm not super inclined to level up my HQ more, since it's 100+ afabs per level now. I have enough ships for my current 21 base permits... no one in corp seems to need sponsored bases... so this seems like the next best thing to throw money into

[19-May-23 07:34 PM] exeler#0000
I guess 58 FP churning out COF nonstop makes a LOT of COF. How many PIO could that sustain at max speed?

@allocater do you make NS in-situ on ZV-639d?


[19-May-23 08:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah only 186k


[19-May-23 08:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's about as many PIO as Nike, heph and Phobos combined


[19-May-23 08:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
So not that many really


[19-May-23 10:40 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Judging by just the charts on the CXs, it could supply AI1, CI1 or IC1 all by itself. We don't really know the demand of the shadowy LM or direct contract economy but it's probably not as high as the CX. The most recent economic report puts mean production of COF at just over 11000 so he's producing roughly 8% of the mean daily production.


[20-May-23 04:19 AM] allocater#0000
yes, but not enough to supply my HYF + corp + ANT


[20-May-23 04:32 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I was just curious if that is what you did, I haven't seen a gas giant used for anything but resource extraction before


[20-May-23 04:50 AM] allocater#0000
I think a lot of people do it, since the COGC switched to Chem


[20-May-23 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm three days ago I sold 500 MHL to Sanggo. at those quantities they are probably only used for COF


[20-May-23 01:21 PM] exeler#0000
He also blew through all my MHL on the CX as well... That's a lot of HYF

Here's hoping a bunch of peeps jump in on COF. 
I don't want to be in the COF business, and I don't want super-cheap COF either. All I want is reasonably-priced COF (and all consumables really) and get on with my personal projects!


[21-May-23 01:55 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Though it still makes sense to buy COF at 3k/u, so I'll still buy at that price if it gets there... I'm just gonna whine and b*tch the whole time!


[21-May-23 02:15 PM] sage42#0000
My third base should be up in a few days, the construction mats are on their way. Once that's done, I'm planing for my fourth to be an HYF base to produce CAF as well as ALG for the PPA and HCP I'll need for the IVPs I want to add to Norwick.


[21-May-23 02:16 PM] sage42#0000
I certainly won't produce 900 COF a day, but it's a start.


[21-May-23 04:25 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
3rd base! That is great congrats! 🥳 
I take it you already have an H2O base to feed the water-hungry HYFs?


[21-May-23 05:08 PM] exeler#0000
I've been running a full base of HYF without a water base. 

There's usually plenty on the CX

Having a dedicated H2O base can definitely help though since you can cut the effective price of H2O down quite a bit.


[21-May-23 05:11 PM] churavis#0000
The best thing about having a dedicated water base is ruining the day of people that try to corner the H2O market and force everyone to pay double. It seems like we get one every month at least

[24-May-23 04:51 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I will be dropping my YK-005d base in the near future so won't be able to supply HAL much longer. If someone does want to take over, I have a great number of BSE for cheap.

ah bullocks, I'll need that!


[24-May-23 05:57 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have a stockpile. I have to empty the base to destroy it so I can possibly deliver some.


[24-May-23 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
sure, I'll take any regularly priced deliveries to Elon


[24-May-23 05:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I'll also make my own base in place of yours


[26-May-23 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm considering offering some sort of Antares welcome money to random players who 1) move / build a base in ANT space and 2) own (or perhaps just recently upgraded to) pro. I'm not sure what the rules should be. I think requiring pro is good because the retention rate of pro players is higher, so the money won't disappear as quickly


[26-May-23 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
250k should get a new player a mostly complete base


[26-May-23 03:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
that sounds interesting


[26-May-23 04:02 PM] sage42#0000
You’re right asking for pro, maybe basic, but definitely not free players unless you’re just looking for a money sink.


[26-May-23 04:04 PM] sage42#0000
Would you target players without corporations (new players) or would you set a limit to the corporation size the person can be part of to receive this money?


[26-May-23 09:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm that's an interesting idea. If they join a big or established corp they probably don't need it. but there's a lot of small corps out there with basically no support network


[26-May-23 09:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
@mrtcsmith let me know once you're ready to tear down 005d, I have the free permit I need now


[27-May-23 12:24 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
It's hard to help free players in any form, they're locked out of a large part of what the game is about and that's possibly a big reason why conversion is so low


[27-May-23 12:24 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have started tearing down and will be done in the next day or two


[27-May-23 03:07 AM] allocater#0000
I give 200k to every new ANT player I can find. basic is required because you can't send money to trial accounts.


[30-May-23 10:16 PM] martin1194#0000
um. so, u will build HAL base?


[30-May-23 10:51 PM] hernanduer#0000

[31-May-23 08:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
I can do 110/u


[31-May-23 06:48 PM] martin1194#0000
On yl-005d or ant?


[31-May-23 10:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
only 005d


[31-May-23 10:54 PM] martin1194#0000
what price can u do if ant?
yl-005d only can rent 1 warehouse not good to buy a stack for LCB/WCB ship.


[31-May-23 11:08 PM] martin1194#0000
if can't be sent to ant with a higher price please say. I will think it later.


[31-May-23 11:11 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
If someone sends you a sell order, it can be placed directly in your bigger ship without needing a warehouse


[31-May-23 11:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yes, you'd ask for a sell order and I can provision that for whenever you arrive


[31-May-23 11:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can't do ANT


[31-May-23 11:22 PM] hernanduer#0000

Hello big brains of OOG - I have a question - I'd want to setup a 3rd farm planet - but not sure where I should look. Already have Demeter and Harmonia. Any suggestions? I want to use it to increase my C production and to supply FP's on Norwick.


[02-Jun-23 06:48 AM] sage42#0000
I just built myself a farm base on pyrgos, about as good as promitor in terms of fertility and water stats and about the same number of jumps from norwick


[02-Jun-23 10:22 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Pyrgos is better than Promitor (slightly).


[02-Jun-23 10:22 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
It's also a 4-day round trip from ANT, flying at full speed.


[02-Jun-23 10:24 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
My suggestion is setting up an empty planet with a CoGC, and focusing it as a HYF base. Then moving HYFs from Harmonia & Demeter and running the FRMs you need on those two.


[02-Jun-23 10:25 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
The benefit of a HYF-only agri planet is that it can be set up anywhere. Perhaps near Ice Station? ANT could do with more agri.


[02-Jun-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
LS-934c looks good, it's a good distance between Etherwind and ANT


[02-Jun-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's hard to find any planets that are unpopulated and near ANT with only 1 negative aspect (let alone golden zone planets)


[02-Jun-23 10:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, a HYF only planet has been discussed before near Ice Station Alpha. I think @mrtcsmith  has such a planet although I'm not sure where.


[02-Jun-23 12:31 PM] allocater#0000
I hear the meta is moving away from FRM, so you can already replace all yours on harmonia and demeter with HYF until there is an unfertile HYF planet I guess


[02-Jun-23 12:33 PM] allocater#0000
or get a base that makes 75k per day and use that to buy ~400 crops #bank-base-ad 😄


[02-Jun-23 12:37 PM] churavis#0000
Their aren't a ton of extra crops on the cx that you can get for any reasonable price


[02-Jun-23 01:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
gonna need a lot more water to support that kind of migration


[02-Jun-23 03:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I've had a quick look but for now I have filled Harmonia with 20 HYF. Another Ag HYF base for CAF would be nice and so would an FP base close to H2O for DW.

[02-Jun-23 05:00 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Yeah I can move my HYF’s around. Got 40 HYFs across Harmonia and Demeter with only 10 FRM. If we make another HYF planet I’d be up for contributing with w/e is needed as well.


[02-Jun-23 05:01 PM] churavis#0000
The difficulty will likely be MHL


[02-Jun-23 05:02 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Ive been abusing Arch in the past for the MHL - I can delay my next ship and contribute to buying some of them.

How about se-110d or b for a HYF base, only SEA and INS?


[03-Jun-23 02:49 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Same system as ISA


[04-Jun-23 04:01 PM] exeler#0000
I've also been producing MHL non stop on like 4 WEL I have on Nike.

Every time I get a small stockpile going on the CX someone comes and scoops it all up.


[04-Jun-23 04:21 PM] churavis#0000
That means you're not charging enough for it


[04-Jun-23 04:53 PM] mrtcsmith#0000

The player activity sheet hadn't been updating due to FIO issues. It's still kind of wonky, so the governor list and base list is not correct. But the player list and activity list is here:

Some bad data in FIO, like DLR is out of the list but still shows up


[12-Jun-23 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
The other F activity ratings seem legit, and those players may wish to step out of the corp / liquidate to the bank / etc

I saw GI4ucon left earlier without saying anything

It is quieter than usual around these parts, likely due to the lack of new content, leaderboards aren't going to change that

Yeah, it does feel like the smallest features are being added and at quite a slow pace


[13-Jun-23 01:15 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah and the sole developer just had marketing added to his list of tasks


[13-Jun-23 02:40 AM] domicius#0000
I guess the big Steam move didn't really work out


[13-Jun-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
A game like this was always gonna be a passion project. The key to long term is they need to add more features or add more patha to keep existing players while attracting new ones. The player base for this is always gonna be small, so it's important to retain existing ones while adding new ones.


[13-Jun-23 02:37 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I think they went too hard for new players too soon that just bounced right off and will never come back, if they had put those resources into polishing the game and adding a few more of the bigger features then those players might have stayed and the older players would have had reason to stick around and keep paying.


[13-Jun-23 02:40 PM] domicius#0000
I think it's just to cerebral a game. The phone game generation isn't gonna get into it. This is some proper Play By Email Stuff


[13-Jun-23 02:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I would love a play by email game 😄


[13-Jun-23 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
The other issue is they have that Steam Review -> Discord plugin going, so they stress hard about every negative review they get. All the negative reviews are players with <2 hours bouncing off the game... and it's listed as a free game on steam, so it's destined to have bad reviews, because it gets a ton of uninvested players who try it just because it's free.


[13-Jun-23 02:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
So they see those negative new player reviews... and know they shouldn't compromise the vision of it as a cerebral game... and they end up compromising with weird newbie friendly features, or endless tutorial rewrites (eve's approach to the "new player experience") has run through this for decades too


[13-Jun-23 02:50 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Eve has the benefit of being able to fly spaceships in 3d and having a faster starting experience and even free players can participate with other players directly.


[13-Jun-23 02:55 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah. They have to commit to the vision. There's nothing else like this.

Nothing like this as an MMO at least


[13-Jun-23 03:20 PM] domicius#0000
In the old days there were a lot of "kingdom" games where you had to grow and  expand. However there was always a short reset because inevitably some guys became too big


[13-Jun-23 03:20 PM] domicius#0000
Here, it just becomes unmanageable after a while


[13-Jun-23 03:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
Also the scale is a lot bigger and there's no combat


[13-Jun-23 03:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
So even lowstrife with his 34 bases is only twice my size


[13-Jun-23 03:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
Vs like tribal wars where the biggest guys have 150 cities


[13-Jun-23 03:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Eve doesn't have a "cap" to the amount of time you can play, (especially immediately after you start). I personally don't really apply the label "idle game" this prun. It's a real-time game, which idle games also are, but it shares very little else with cookie clicker and the like. I think the label is distracting and confuses the type of game to a lot of new players. I don't think those "kingdom" style games really used that label either. (I used to play one back in about 2002).


[13-Jun-23 03:55 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah, its funny how the clicker-game comments just show an ignorance of this whole genre!


[13-Jun-23 03:56 PM] domicius#0000
The slower pace does lose people, but you spend the down time planning... Just like real life.

Once my base gets the pioneers and settlers it needs, I'm gonna be making a ton of NS on ZV-639D and shipping it to Harmonia/ANT. 

I'm gonna have way more than I can use myself so expect to see some NS auctions semi-regularly.

[15-Jun-23 05:47 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I will take some as spare when it's available. I have 639D doing N and NS and 759b just doing NS, I expect to use it all on two HYF bases making CAF.

Can I get some advice please?
Someone just dropped a base on Electronica with 12 LABs. A little 12k planet with next to no infrastructure.


[23-Jun-23 12:47 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Can someone look at the planet and perhaps advise on what to do?


[23-Jun-23 01:02 PM] domicius#0000
From what perspective?


[23-Jun-23 01:12 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
The sudden lack of POP


[23-Jun-23 01:23 PM] churavis#0000
You can ignore it and let that one base deal with it or raise taxes on chemistry techs and build a PAR


[23-Jun-23 02:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
They probably should have known better. If they want it dealt with, they should work with the governor on immigration and infrastructure. That's what happened when someone wanted a bunch of engineers on QJ-650c, they paid per program


[23-Jun-23 02:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
And if they haven't reached out to you, then... I would just ignore it


[23-Jun-23 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Technicians aren't too hard though, I definitely recommend running Festival 3s if you aren't running anythign else. It will be quite cheap and can keep them sorta-happy

I've just set up shop on KI-401a as well, which is _disgustingly_ close to b (like <1hr flight time most of the time), so I'd love to develop it as metallurgy to complement b as RE

If any governors want a good deal on OFF I've been making boat loads of it (seriously, shipping this stuff has become my bottleneck) and will keep making it for a while longer until I end up with a stockpile on the CX. I'm happy to fill orders for as much as anyone could reasonably want at 60/u

I make around 1500 per day right now, but could bump that up to 4500 per day if anyone wants to put in an insane order.

I'd love some off


[12-Jul-23 08:43 AM] exeler#0000
Either works for me. I ship from Hephaestus to ANT pretty regularly. 

If you have a large order you'll probably get it faster from Heph than ANT as I'll need a little extra time to ship it.


[13-Jul-23 01:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
4k off sounds good if you can send a contract for that wherever 😄


[13-Jul-23 03:30 PM] higgsy#0000
I'll buy 300 OFF


[14-Jul-23 02:00 AM] sage42#0000
So my shipping capacity sucks, it’ll take a while to accumulate the money necessary to fix that issue. But I have an idea to increase my income without increasing my shipping requirements too much. I’d like use my current capital build a base for basic ressource extraction on a planet with a local market.


[14-Jul-23 02:01 AM] sage42#0000

[14-Jul-23 05:02 AM] melon164#0000
I'd love someone to set up on EW-238c and pull HAL and maybe FEO; I've always felt that it had the potential to be a powerhouse for RBH/RSE between three or four players


[14-Jul-23 07:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Allocater also offers shipping-free EDC bases in the #bank-of-oog channel, that's a nice and easy income boost


[14-Jul-23 03:54 PM] allocater#0000
yes it pays 75k / day so you can get your ship upgrade faster, but you can also get a loan to buy the ship upgrades today and then pay it off with all the new profits


[14-Jul-23 03:54 PM] allocater#0000
or both 😄

There's not a ton that gets sold. in the last 30 days there were 3 sales, 22, 11, and 5. I don't think any of those were me. Over the past 90 days there were more sales, but some of them were me

I think this would be a fun idea once the recurring contracts go in. Or if you allow paying multiple weeks premium at a time. Otherwise sending money each week might get tedious


[18-Jul-23 10:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I expect the tedium of collecting money to be much higher than dealing with payouts


[18-Jul-23 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
With recurring payments I'll need to be mindful of when they age into the next bracket, but I can make a spreadsheet to do that (pull their info from FIO)


[19-Jul-23 10:17 AM] allocater#0000
nice idea, but what if 2 people play-act a robbery so that you pay? then they split the payment and secretly complete the shipment 😄


[19-Jul-23 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
The only defense I have there is that I hope the requirement for public reporting will dissuade some of that


[19-Jul-23 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
the conspiring contract-breaker will be ostracized by the UFO community, and hopefully that's enough dissuasion


[20-Jul-23 01:13 AM] zipatsu#0000

I propose the following nicknames for ships for the sake of brevity and clarity:

*Hauler: a ship with a WCB 3k ton/1k volume capacity and low tier engine (QCR, RCT, ENG, FSE)

*Carrier: a ship with an LCB 2k ton/2k volume capacity and low tier engine (QCR, RCT, ENG, FSE)

*Tanker: a ship with a VCB 1k ton/3k volume capacity and low tier engine (QCR, RCT, ENG, FSE)

*Puddlejumper: any ship with only slower than light capability

*Lifter: a ship with 500 ton/ 500 volume cargo bay or greater that also has high tier engines(AEN, HTE, HPR, HYR) high tier plates(RHP, HHP, AHP) and gravity seats of either kind

*Yacht: a ship with 250 ton/ 250 volume cargo bay or less that also has high tier engines(AEN, HTE, HPR, HYR) high tier plates(RHP, HHP, AHP) and gravity seats of either kind

is nobody putting the monster engines on a 2k or 3k?


[25-Aug-23 12:53 PM] churavis#0000
That would be covered under Lifter


[25-Aug-23 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
“Lifter” needs a cooler name that reflects the luxury of the high end engine. Otherwise it sounds pretty good. I kind of like descriptive names like “the 2k standard” for what is listed there as “carrier”


[25-Aug-23 01:39 PM] melon164#0000
You could go with Clipper (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper), seems appropriate


[25-Aug-23 02:03 PM] churavis#0000
I like Clipper, we'll use that


[25-Aug-23 02:04 PM] churavis#0000
"The 2k Standard" rolls off the tongue like a square wheeled bicycle and had too many syllables. It needs to be short and sound cool, that's what matters most.

don't include advanced plates, their weight actually takes away more acceleration than the G forces they tolerate. It would only be useful if you're WAY over accelerating, something like a 250/250 or MAYbe 500/500


[25-Aug-23 02:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
LHP are the lightest of them all, and thus are the best


[25-Aug-23 02:45 PM] churavis#0000
This isn't about what's optimal, it's about what's common.


[25-Aug-23 02:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
optimal should be the most common though


[25-Aug-23 02:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
else people are just being silly


[25-Aug-23 02:46 PM] churavis#0000
Using LHP with a high tier engine is silly as the plates fall apart at higher acceleration and thus prevent full use of the engine.

Lol, only if it gets stranded somewhere


[26-Aug-23 04:42 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I'm going to disagree: "clippers" were really little yachts that carried very small, very high-value cargo at mast-break speeds. "Yachts" should be renamed "clippers".
"Yachts" are what rich douchebags sail to only move their fat lards around.
I also think "Carriers" should be renamed "Cathedral" ships, but that's a personal preference (from obvious reference).
"Lifters" could be named "galleons", since they were the big-cargo _and_ fast ships of their time.


[26-Aug-23 04:43 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Though "cruiser" would also work, since they are big and fast (they are military ships though, if that matters).


[28-Aug-23 01:05 PM] churavis#0000
I was thinking about the names over the weekend and decided I liked Higgsy' idea of using an adjective to describe the engine tier and the noun to indicate the cargo bay size. I wanted the adjective to be single syllable and the noun to be a two syllable word ending in '-er'. This is what I came up with:

[28-Aug-23 02:06 PM] exeler#0000
Could break out the engine types a bit more. 

Stock - Tier 1 - RCT, ENG
Improved - Tier 2 - QCR, FSE
Premium - Tier 3 - (whatever is next)
Lux - Tier 4 - ...

Then an STL only ship could have a prefix of Cab (or whatever else we decide) so you could have a Stock Clipper, but also a Cab Stock Clipper

The nice thing about the different pieces of the naming convention having specific purposes is that you could leave out any of the descriptive words if they're not important. 

"I'll send my Hauler on over there" means "I'll send my 3k/1k ship over there" or "I've got a Cab in that system for that" is "I've got an STL only ship in that system for that".  Specific phrases that communicate specific information are easy to craft and consume naturally.


[28-Aug-23 02:21 PM] churavis#0000
There is a cost to more specificity, in that it's harder to remember and use, especially for newbies. Do the benefits of that greater level of specificity justify the cost?

In addition, it's not that crazy to imagine someone putting an RCT with an FSE, what would you call it then? You wouldn't put it with an HYR, on the other hand.

Most importantly, I could not, for the life of me, find a synonym for conventional that was one syllable besides stock, even lux and cab are pushing it.


[28-Aug-23 02:25 PM] churavis#0000
Also, yes, I expect that people will not always use the both names, in which case you can assume it's whatever version is most common, e.g. just saying 'carrier' would mean a stock carrier and just saying 'cab' would mean a cab clipper.


[28-Aug-23 06:25 PM] exeler#0000
I mean for shipping contracts if someone says they have a carrier, I'd just not assume any other specs. All I really care about is that it's a 2k/2k. 

I think for basically all day to day uses people will just use the shipping capacity of the ship to identify their ships. So just carrier, hauler, tanker, clipper, etc. 

The only time the other parts are important is when someone is requesting the parts to build a ship. I think having a small set of extra quantifiers to say what "tier" of ship they want gives us some simple vocabulary to talk about them. Especially since the production chains for the different tiers of engine can be pretty different. 

We may have tons of parts laying around for standard ships, but have a long waiting list for the lux stuff.

I think to go along with what you said, having too many of these terms could be too complex to the point of being unusable. So I like the idea of having just a few terms like you've enumerated here. 

For someone building a mismatched ship that uses different tires of engines or doesn't fit one of the standard categories, we'll just have to revert to using specific item names for things.

What price per unit for SUN makes it a viable option for governors to use?


[05-Sep-23 01:16 AM] fremen45#0000
Okay I think I can supply that. I need to expand my HAL base to account for that draw.


[05-Sep-23 01:16 AM] exeler#0000
Oooh, that would be awesome. I have no plans to build a HAL tap of my own for a long while, so you'd have a steady customer for a while 😄


[05-Sep-23 01:18 AM] fremen45#0000
Yeah I can give you about 300 HAL either tomorrow or Wednesday. I might need help with shipping the stuff if you can?


[05-Sep-23 01:28 AM] exeler#0000
Where do you have the HAL at? I'm happy to pick up on ANT, Griffonstone, or ZV-639D with no questions asked.

Picking up somewhere else might be out of my way and I'd have to squint at my shipping a bit to see how regularly I could land there.


[05-Sep-23 02:10 AM] fremen45#0000
My HAL base is at YK-005d.


[05-Sep-23 09:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's already viable over DW for SSTs


[05-Sep-23 11:19 AM] exeler#0000
If I sell SUN for 300/u it's more profitable for me than the OFF@60/u, and both of those beat out anything else I could spend my BMP time on by a decent margin, just limited by how much people are willing to buy


[05-Sep-23 11:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
they'll still be less efficient than OFF, but definitely better than DW


[05-Sep-23 11:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
problem is they're only used in SST, while OFF is used for SST and INF


[05-Sep-23 12:08 PM] melon164#0000
Being able to send out one commodity to supply both SST and INF is seriously helpful


[05-Sep-23 07:20 PM] pateirn#0000
okay, so you guys like C right? A group of us have been cooking up a pretty wild idea, so we are very open to suggestions. We are thinking of colonizing parts of the nascent system, to put HYF's, to make mats to burn on nascent. We would need to build a shipyard, the idea is built around using puddle jumpers, and buildings for settlers. How crazy is this?


[05-Sep-23 07:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
Those would be expensive bases ... TSH or HSE depending on which planet


[05-Sep-23 07:23 PM] pateirn#0000
We did think of that yes


[05-Sep-23 07:23 PM] dehzhas#0000
That maintenance cost would drive profits down a lot


[05-Sep-23 07:23 PM] pateirn#0000
Very fair


[05-Sep-23 07:26 PM] dehzhas#0000
It would almost be better to do HYFs at Norwick. It's HSE, SEA, INS depending on planet, which is cheaper and more available than TSH. Then you could do RAT on Norwick or burn for C depending on your preference


[05-Sep-23 07:27 PM] dehzhas#0000
Also, I would be interested in doing that. I would have to do math to see if the numbers worked out though.


[05-Sep-23 07:28 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have been looking for a system with multiple low cost bases available


[05-Sep-23 07:28 PM] tuffyless#0000
HSE & INS.
Very-very rough draft.


**QJ-149c** is Nascent - make C.  149d can feed it with Agri's.

**QJ-149d** - put down HYF BUI's, install a Agri CoGC, and it costs HSE + INS to build.  Will be semi-expensive.

**QJ-149e** - produces 36 H2O/day per BUI, install a ResExt CoGC, and it costs HSE + INS to build.  Will be as expensive as ISA is.

PuddleJumper or two or three to keep things moving.
Still need to figure out NS.  N + LST.


[05-Sep-23 07:28 PM] pateirn#0000
Yeah, I was just looking the the harmonia syetem too, nothing looks good


[05-Sep-23 07:36 PM] pateirn#0000
I do like this idea of HYF's basically everywhere though lol


[05-Sep-23 07:37 PM] dehzhas#0000
If you can win the COGC as an Ag planet, it is very enticing


[05-Sep-23 07:42 PM] dehzhas#0000
I will warn you, starting and ramping a planet for HYF bases takes a while. You are understaffed forever. I was the first base on ZV-194b and it took forever to ramp for HYF and get full settlers. Then RiseOfFilth and company plopped down a few bases and won the COGC from me and rode in on my coat tails having worked to cultivate the population.


[05-Sep-23 07:43 PM] dehzhas#0000
So.... if you want to do that strat, make sure you are patient and have enough peeps to keep the COGC.


[05-Sep-23 07:50 PM] exeler#0000
I've been independently thinking of the same thing. Let's do it


[05-Sep-23 07:51 PM] pateirn#0000
Okay, we obviously need to come up with a plan that makes actual sense, but I love this idea. I feel like a big group of C producers could literally develop the region more if we make enough.


[05-Sep-23 08:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
You're looking at an H2O cost of at least 16/u and HCP at 130/u. The depreciation cost per cycle on the EXT and HYF is about the same, at 140/cycle. Also keep in mind EXT are much bigger than RIG so you will not get a lot of water


[05-Sep-23 08:17 PM] pateirn#0000
Okay very good to know. Our plan makes less sense now lol


[05-Sep-23 08:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
The depreciation is included in the per unit costs I listed. So profits will be slim, but definitely do some more in depth analysis


[05-Sep-23 08:33 PM] pateirn#0000
Any ideas on the most effecient planets/shipping?


[05-Sep-23 10:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
A while ago we had floated a HYF planet somewhere near ISA


[05-Sep-23 10:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't do C production personally, but whatever you grow in a HYF takes pressure of FRMs


[05-Sep-23 11:33 PM] exeler#0000
With a single HYF base you can fuel a ton of INC. 

My ideal plan would be to find a way to get shipping to balance out. If I can fly H2O in, swap for crops, hop over a planet, drop the crops and swap for C, then fly back out that would be sweet.


[05-Sep-23 11:37 PM] fremen45#0000
It depends on what recipe you are using. To produce the most C you would need to run the 8 hour recipe which is 1000 space of farming to support.


[06-Sep-23 12:22 AM] exeler#0000
Stacking the fast recipe with HYF goods brings the cost per C up quite a bit. 

With HYF you're already trading a higher cost per crop in exchange for making a ton more of them. 

So running the fast recipe on already expensive crops makes for very expensive C. 

I usually run the HCP+GRN and HCP+MAI recipes in the INC with cheap GRN and MAI from a FRM base.

Okay, the cost is what I never really looked at. It is significantly cheaper to do GRN and MAI in a FRM? Then just run HYF on all HCP?


[06-Sep-23 06:58 AM] melon164#0000
FRMs have better ROI (higher profit per $ invested), but HYFs are denser (higher profit per base area unit invested)


[06-Sep-23 06:59 AM] melon164#0000
So for your first or second base, where the permit is free, FRMs are better.  For your 25th base where the permit costs you 50M, HYFs are better


[06-Sep-23 06:59 AM] melon164#0000
There are also limited fertile planets, but you can put HYFs anywhere


[06-Sep-23 07:53 AM] pateirn#0000
Okay that makes perfect sense. I have HYF on Harm right now, was planning FRM on Demeter.


[06-Sep-23 11:56 AM] exeler#0000
Yeah, I think FRM has one of the highest ROI based on input cost. The limiting factor is time and places to build FRM. 

FRM take up a ton of space so you can't build a ton of them. Then they work slow, so you don't get a super amazing throughout. 

HYF are more expensive to build, cost more to run, but produce more and take up less space. So HCP that comes from a FRM is a lot cheaper to make, but you're limited by how much you can make. 

I want to find a few planets with no resources (or at least no useful concentrations of them) on them to turn into HYF agriculture worlds so that the fertile agriculture world's can be used for FRM. 

Putting HYF on a fertile world just to take advantage of the agriculture COGC is a waste of the area that could've been using the planet's fertility.

Okay I absolutely love this plan. I have not combed the map, but are there sectors like that?


[06-Sep-23 12:06 PM] exeler#0000
I haven't done a deep search either. Most of the community tools are catered to finding useful worlds, but in this case we're kind of looking for a garbage world 😅


[06-Sep-23 12:08 PM] exeler#0000
Ideally it would be close to the places where crops are consumed to help keep shipping manageable. 

That being said, finding a place where an INC planet and a FP planet could also go would be lit. 

Shipping H2O and NS in and RAT/DW out seems like a dream.


[06-Sep-23 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Avoiding the expensive materials is nice. I thought we foudn one close to ISA before. SE-648a could be flipped from metallurgy to Agriculture. There's a second water planet in SE-648 also. and it's on the ANT side of ISA.


[06-Sep-23 12:09 PM] pateirn#0000
Okay, so part of the plan I was thinking of was using a puddle jumper to do the in sytem stuff. How expensive is a shipyard? lol


[06-Sep-23 12:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
PLI SE-866e could be ours.


[06-Sep-23 12:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Does anyone have a chart of costs of the different extra building mats?


[06-Sep-23 12:11 PM] exeler#0000
There's also some COGC that can boost pioneers. 

If we found a planet that had H2O on it, we could stack, RIG, HYF, INC and FP on it and have all of them benefit from the plain PIO cogc. Then no shipping for intermediary goods, just funnel things through the LM or contracts.


[06-Sep-23 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
TSH sucks, but SEA+INS isn't _that_ bad, right?


[06-Sep-23 12:13 PM] exeler#0000
Could even stick SME there to use the C. Then you're really only bringing in ore and taking out metal. Both fit nicely in a 3kt ship.

Food stuff inputs and outputs all fit nice in a 2k/2k


[06-Sep-23 12:14 PM] exeler#0000
I actually found SEA is super easy to make. I can make a ton of it if we need it in large quantities


[06-Sep-23 12:14 PM] maddenhenge#0000
Maybe QJ-149 E?


[06-Sep-23 12:15 PM] pateirn#0000
INS doesn't look awful either, I would need more labs though

2,505,755.08 base cost, 669,438.00 of that is INS


[06-Sep-23 12:17 PM] melon164#0000
I quite like https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch for planet searching


[06-Sep-23 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
If it's high temperature, TSH for the base costs 970,200.00


[06-Sep-23 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
TSH are pretty much the most expensive, I think?


[06-Sep-23 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
followed by HSE


[06-Sep-23 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
(ignoring gravity effects)


[06-Sep-23 12:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can supply discount BL, but high gravity is quite rare.


[06-Sep-23 12:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Better for me to put material numbers instead of costs:  33 TSH, or 4,830 INS.


[06-Sep-23 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
I guess HSE vs INS gets into an argument about building size. Big buildings, HSE are cheaper, small, INS will be


[06-Sep-23 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
and SEA is like way, way below that


[06-Sep-23 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
QJ-149e is HSE + INS


[06-Sep-23 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
big ouchie there 😅


[06-Sep-23 12:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
QJ-149a is just TSH and no one voted this week for the COGC, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind if it flipped 😉


[06-Sep-23 12:23 PM] melon164#0000
Assuming you intend to fill the base, INS is pretty much a flat cost (some rounding effects).  But the HSE/TSH cost varies wildly depending on what you fill the base with


[06-Sep-23 12:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
20 HYF in a base, which is a lot more than say, WPLs, heh


[06-Sep-23 12:24 PM] melon164#0000
a full base of SME, TSH will double the cost of; but a full base of AML it'll be a rounding error


[06-Sep-23 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, but a lot less than 39 RIGs

[06-Sep-23 12:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
so fit the planet to the task, basically, but where 🤔


[06-Sep-23 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems more important to be close to a water planet (ISA or Etherwind) than to be close to Nascent, looking at the shipping numbers.


[06-Sep-23 12:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
QJ-149a is dead planet, would take a little while


[06-Sep-23 12:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
but only requires TSH


[06-Sep-23 12:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
and 149e is mineral water, so 1/2 as much output as liquid


[06-Sep-23 12:26 PM] pateirn#0000
and how many planets do we want in a system? Or are we just looking for 1?


[06-Sep-23 12:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess I'm looking just for 1, because sets are hard to find, and ships are cheap now. There will be out-of-system shipping anyway, so puddle jumpers are really only supplements.


[06-Sep-23 12:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
149a is good choice for HYFs with Nascent right there, only 7h away


[06-Sep-23 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
and importing water isn't really that big a deal with an LCB


[06-Sep-23 12:28 PM] pateirn#0000
Okay, I looked at that planet. you don't think it's that crazy?


[06-Sep-23 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
ISA to 149a is only a day


[06-Sep-23 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
well it's only one malus


[06-Sep-23 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's the worst one, but most other *free* planets are gonna give you two maluses


[06-Sep-23 12:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
SE-648a is only INS and two jumps from ISA (but in the wrong direction)


[06-Sep-23 12:29 PM] hernanduer#0000

not that I'm really worried about the logistics of any of them


[06-Sep-23 12:33 PM] pateirn#0000
So rough possible game plan, Harm and Demeter for FRM. QJ-149A for HYF, Nascent for INC


[06-Sep-23 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
IY-206j is one jump from Nascent


[06-Sep-23 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
oops 3 jumps, nevermind


[06-Sep-23 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
IY-816e is ins only, and that's one jump out. IY-816d is SEA + INS, if we want a pair of planets.


[06-Sep-23 12:35 PM] maddenhenge#0000
IY-816 e is a single malus, doesn't seem like a great planet


[06-Sep-23 12:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
and IY-816d actually has water.


[06-Sep-23 12:36 PM] maddenhenge#0000
Mineral though


[06-Sep-23 12:36 PM] archielvahr#0000

Ahh


[06-Sep-23 12:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
IY-816d for water -> puddlejumper to HYFs on IY-816e.. one jump to nascent for INC

I honestly don't understand the development design behind soooo many garbage planets.


[06-Sep-23 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
randomly generated


[06-Sep-23 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the algorithm was backwards and made all the good planets in the core instead of outside

it's why the entire southern half of the universe is unpopulated


[06-Sep-23 12:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
and in the north, idk did they place Saladin? I wasn't here then, but there's a couple fertile planets there and the best H2O planet in the universe


[06-Sep-23 12:40 PM] pateirn#0000
Like, I feel like they could pick a few sectors with 0 people in them, re roll the planets without a universe reset


[06-Sep-23 12:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's low priority, the problem is still what do you even do with that space


[06-Sep-23 12:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the time takes so long


[06-Sep-23 12:41 PM] pateirn#0000
If there were good planets, I feel like it would be possible lol


[06-Sep-23 12:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
but they'd have to be so good that the core becomes bad - then new players get outcompeted by the older players who can import their products

Lot of iron but, might be usable still


[06-Sep-23 12:49 PM] hernanduer#0000

INS is actually much more than I thought it would be, that's INS @ 133.25/u.. we could do cheaper per unit internally (which is the case for all of them I'm sure)


[06-Sep-23 01:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
I see a base production cost of only about 50/u on INS

Summary:

Options near Etherwind
    Need to look!

Options near Ice Station Alpha
* ZV-639 b
    1 jump from ISA and CX- TSH only
* SE-110 same system as ISA.
    SE-110e -> AEF + INS
    SE-110b/d -> INS + SEA
    
Options near Nascent:
* YK-005 a
    One jump from Nascent, towards Harmonia.
    TSH only
* IY-816
    One jump away from Nascent, away from CX
    IY-816d has EXT based Water, SEA + INS, probably better to import from ISA/Etherwind
    IY-816e INS only, for HYFs
    Has puddlejumping opportunities
* QJ-149A for HYFs.
    Same system as Nascent
    TSH only
    
Threats: SE-866e (get murdered by Hern)

Cost guide for 20 HYF planet:
SEA: $23k
AEF: $324k
INS: $468k
TSH: $660k

Shipping guide:
20 HYFs making HCP: import 1,123.50t of water, and export 642t of crops


[06-Sep-23 02:01 PM] maddenhenge#0000

two perfect planets, one with water in the same system as one for HYFs.

If you have a group of planets that are amazing, the logistics aren’t really an issue. I routinely fly ships on multi-day journey and carry extra FF on board for the way back. It’s more a matter of how many ships do you want to devote to it.

[06-Sep-23 10:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
If the heaviest lifting can be done locally (water and crops), then moving the C back isn't quite as arduous. Even better if we had enough planets to really make a chain out there. H2O -> HCP -> C -> (EPO/DDT/PE/PG) and ship that back.

https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch and https://prunplanner.org/search will help with that particular problem a bit


[06-Sep-23 10:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
well only sort of. need some custom tooling to find systems with groups, but prunplanner can sort of do that like this:

but water


[06-Sep-23 10:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
also make sure it's Liquid instead of Mineral, or you have to cut the number in half

are either of you using FIO?


[06-Sep-23 10:54 PM] maddenhenge#0000
the map for FIO doesnt load for me


[06-Sep-23 10:54 PM] fremen45#0000
I feel like you search for H20 and sort by quatity output.


[06-Sep-23 10:55 PM] fremen45#0000
then you can look throught those systems.

HV-512b is only perfect that system


[06-Sep-23 10:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm, that one is atmospheric so it uses a COL, which isn't as bad as an EXT

still a fair bit of a drop from the RIG though.


[06-Sep-23 11:00 PM] fremen45#0000
as a system Idea. it's bad but it's consistently bad and you have 3 planets and one has H2O

OY-569c uses HSE but has good liquid water. OY-569b is SEA only (which is nearly free).. But OY isn't really near ANT space


[06-Sep-23 11:07 PM] maddenhenge#0000
i checked this and its mineral water btw


[06-Sep-23 11:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah bummer.


[06-Sep-23 11:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
lemme do a price workup for RIGs on the different materials


[06-Sep-23 11:09 PM] fremen45#0000
yeah I saw that but why does that matter? it's over 30 a day. what would it have to be if it were mineral?


[06-Sep-23 11:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
A 500/500 area planet holds 11 HB1s and 36 rigs. For liquid water


[06-Sep-23 11:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if you are EXTing mineral water, you can only fit 15 EXT and 9 HB1s.


[06-Sep-23 11:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
so 30 per building per day


[06-Sep-23 11:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
and it's more workers required per unit extracted too


[06-Sep-23 11:15 PM] fremen45#0000

now it's obscene at 33 jumps. but we are tied for second closet and the next system over has HE3 so we could launch REF in the same system

[06-Sep-23 11:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
SEA is pretty much free. TSH is a killer. INS isn't really great.


[06-Sep-23 11:23 PM] fremen45#0000
this is the one that I think Archiel found already that requires HSE and TSH but it is liquid and we are the closest at 14 jumps.

Yeaaah, HSE + TSH turns a 1m base into a 2.4m base 😭


[06-Sep-23 11:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think H2O is the worst material in this regard


[06-Sep-23 11:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
especially since it swaps EXT/RIG/COL based on the other negatives


[06-Sep-23 11:27 PM] fremen45#0000
that is liquid. H2O on that planet according to FIO.


[06-Sep-23 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yes, that is a weird one. Like Ice Station Alpha


[06-Sep-23 11:32 PM] archielvahr#0000

KW-020d is a candidate for a HYF planet. Seems like it already is one. It's 3 jumps from etherwind, but 2 of them are jumps away from ANT space so that's a bit of a bummer.

Should I even produce it myself?


[07-Sep-23 02:40 PM] churavis#0000
Demeter - Nascent is a great combo for growing and burning C and you can also extract ALO from Nascent as well


[07-Sep-23 02:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
C prices seem pretty high, so it's not a bad choice if it interests you


[07-Sep-23 03:16 PM] mrsmith33#0000
But there are more profitable recipes out there. The only real benefit of own C production is steady supply of it to my buildings that use it. While making something more profitable covers the margin I would have earned by producing C myself + much more.


[07-Sep-23 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
That is a good way to think about it


[08-Sep-23 02:27 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Carbon market is not stable, since so many industries use it. You may find yourself running out at a critical time just when the market hits 900/u again.


[08-Sep-23 02:28 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I don't make Carbon myself, so this fluctuation is something I try plan for.


[09-Sep-23 12:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Saw a new tidbit about orbital structures on the roadmap. Hadn't heard this elsewhere:


[09-Sep-23 12:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
```Orbital Structures
Allows to build space stations in orbit around planets, allowing to use ships for transport that do not require the ability to land on planetary surfaces or fly within atmospheres.```


[09-Sep-23 12:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
That suggests to me a change to ships as well.


[09-Sep-23 12:53 PM] churavis#0000
I interpreted that as a space elevator


[09-Sep-23 12:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh, yeah that makes sense.


[09-Sep-23 12:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe the wording there is just strange, suggesting new ships that can't land on surfaces. But that does line up with previous statements about space elevators


[09-Sep-23 12:54 PM] churavis#0000
I expect it will take lot's of exotic mats but will save fuel and time for ships in not having to land or takeoff of the planet


[09-Sep-23 12:58 PM] domicius#0000
Functionally unimportant change though. Unless you can build different kind of orbital structures to make exotic materials

{Reactions}
🤔 

[09-Sep-23 01:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
Decent fuel savings and reduces repair load. Also if they do mean to make ships that can't land, perhaps they'll be lighter and go faster


[09-Sep-23 01:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah,  I'd rather have some new mechanics than "oh this flight doesn't use as much SF any more"... cause I don't even calculate or think about fuel costs anymore

[09-Sep-23 03:07 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I suspect they may introduce large freighters that cannot land on planets, only at stations and elevators. I know we'd all love ships that can carry 5k/5k or more.

{Reactions}
🤤 (2) 

[09-Sep-23 03:31 PM] churavis#0000
It would be an interesting dynamic to have large ships that are more efficient but require expensive infrastructure in order to work, you'd have to decide how much of your shipping capacity is between planet's with elevators and planets without


[09-Sep-23 06:10 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, bigger ships that have a drawback would be an interesting change that adds some variety to shipping 🤔


[09-Sep-23 11:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay there weren't any tools that did what I wanted, so I wrote one in Jupyter (pandas and networkx)


[09-Sep-23 11:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
On this map, any system marked in purple has one planet that can be colonized with only MCG or MCG+SEA (aka the really cheap one)

Orange has two.. and there's a single system with 3. It's OS-099 in southern ANT space

Moria has a ton. I suspect these were hand placed and hand improved  where there's a CX

I was out of town during the big HYF planet discussions, but I was looking at putting HYF as close to Nascent as possible to simplify shipping.

Specifically, the two gaseous planets that are in QJ-149.

With corp pricing for AEF (2000/u) and INS (100/u) and the costs I have configured for NS (140/u) and H2O (15/u) because I make those myself, it looks like both of these are viable.

Why does Hortus get both the bootstrapping tap, and the best-in-game tap?


[13-Sep-23 07:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
After tons of looking, I think this is my conclusion too. There's no cheaper planets close enough to Nascent or other water taps to outweigh the shipping savings.


[13-Sep-23 07:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
I might run a tiny bit more math today

all planets with a base cost under 2.4m sorted by distance from either Nascent or water taps, aka: good places for a HYF. Colonized planets have the COGC noted, because it probably can't be flipped, but just in case it will be printed.

Filth is asking me about 639d and making it res instead of chem. No idea who needs that much N


[13-Sep-23 07:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Actually everything in QJ-149 is about the same. The gas giants clock in at 2,480,000 AIC per HYF base. so maybe that was a poor threshold. There is probably enough price/availablity variability that they are all about equal in-system. There's a case for putting it closer to the water tap than the INCs, but the incs seem a bit more popular.
`    QJ-149a         HYF Base Cost: 2368k      High Temp (TSH), `
or
`QJ-149g/f         HYF Base Cost: 2480k      Low Temp (INS), Gas (AEF),`

LS-231c/d is a good choice if we are by etherwind. It's on the way if you're coming from etherwind to Nascent. 
`LS-231c         HYF Base Cost: 1960k      High Press (HSE),`

Near ISA, in system at SE-110b is an okay choice 
`SE-110b         HYF Base Cost: 2179k      Low Temp (INS), Low Press (SEA), `


[13-Sep-23 07:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
10k water goes a long way for HYFs, it's not too much to ask an LCB shipment every 5 days I'd think


[13-Sep-23 07:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
Even if it's a few extra jumps past QJ 149

Maybe we should vote:
Where should the corp place a new AGRI planet for HYFs?

[14-Sep-23 07:15 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I started a base focused on making AEF. Currently at 25u/day, with 35u/day at Experts 5. Best price I can do is 2k/u.

Does he watch the system population counts for each planet daily? Or does he want my `co ARCL` base count?


[17-Sep-23 02:58 PM] maddenhenge#0000
No idea


[17-Sep-23 02:59 PM] maddenhenge#0000
Wonder how much it would cost me to start setting a base up there


[17-Sep-23 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
about 2,179,000 AIC for a full HYF base


[17-Sep-23 03:12 PM] maddenhenge#0000
Hmm
So would be a multi month longterm project


[17-Sep-23 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
we need AGRI buildings other than FRM and HYF


[17-Sep-23 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
need a fish farm or something

Once Dehz is back, we will see about immigration projects- there was something about not being able to run them right away, but we'll see how that looks now that there's a POPI report


[23-Sep-23 04:46 PM] mrsmith33#0000
How often do you guys supply your bases with consumables? I'm maintaining 10 day worth of stuff atm


[23-Sep-23 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Meanwhile, Harpercz of FCST contacted me. They seem to have a plan to make SE-110d the hyf planet, 110b the INC planet, and 110a food production... so trying to change his mind on that, especially since people are already moving out of 110d.


[23-Sep-23 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I used to run them at like 5 days when I was resource constrained, but then I got tired of that and now I aim for 20 days of consumables everywhere.


[23-Sep-23 04:47 PM] churavis#0000
I always send at least 30 days of consumables just so I don't have to get those annoying messages before I come by next


[23-Sep-23 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
they didn't build any POPI or planetary projects anywhere so... I think we should go with the plan that we started and actually built towards 😛

If it came down to a COGC election fight, who would win?


[23-Sep-23 04:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Totally unclear. I'm the only one on 110b, and we have the governor so we can mess with taxes. We can bring people in pretty fast, I imagine


[23-Sep-23 04:52 PM] churavis#0000
I plan on coming out there myself eventually but I can come quicker if needed, I just don't see the point while you're still building up the population


[23-Sep-23 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't care about their other planets, so the rest of their plan is fine


[23-Sep-23 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, population will be a constraint for a while


[23-Sep-23 04:55 PM] maddenhenge#0000
Should I use my 3rd permit to go get set up over there?


[23-Sep-23 04:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nahhh, probably not so early in your development. If y ou want more agri, I would start with Harmonia and Demeter first

I just dropped a base with habs and some STO, but no HYF yet on 110b

Your pion's are going to get bored. Idle hands are the devil's workshop


[23-Sep-23 11:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds like they are on board with SE-110b staying the HYF planet. They will develop INC and FP planets in system too.


[24-Sep-23 08:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Where do people spend their produced PG? Is it all self-consumed, or it is being sold to others?


[24-Sep-23 08:19 AM] mrsmith33#0000
But if I calculate it, 5500 PG/day is only good for 110 NL/ day


[24-Sep-23 08:20 AM] churavis#0000
PG is used in a ton of products but PSL and PSM use a ton of PG and you need a lot of both for even just one prefab production building


[24-Sep-23 09:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah PG is just eaten up everywhere. Idk why anyone would need 110 NL/d but I use 2500 PG/d on some NL, all the PPF products, and in my PP2s, among other places


[24-Sep-23 10:17 AM] maddenhenge#0000
thinking about this again, what does a very basic farm base look like on harmonia, because im sure yall have optimized it


[24-Sep-23 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Probably something like 1 STO, max farms, and however many HB1s it takes to house them


[24-Sep-23 10:18 AM] maddenhenge#0000
ah


[24-Sep-23 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
I actually have a few FP on my base, but I'm going to get rid of them since they don't have the bonus and are taking up valuable FRM space


[24-Sep-23 10:18 AM] maddenhenge#0000
fair


[24-Sep-23 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
1 STO, 7 HB1, 13 FRM is 500/500 area 🙂


[24-Sep-23 10:20 AM] maddenhenge#0000
yea, i had figured, 1 sto, 7 hb1, 12 frm, 3 rig so i dont have to fast upgrade to another hq level and take debt to make an isa base

KW-602c is an option but it's not in or near Antares space


[24-Sep-23 11:46 AM] exeler#0000
It sounded like that other group was gonna set up an FP planet in SE-110 as well. No reason we can't also plop down bases there


[24-Sep-23 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup


[24-Sep-23 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
It will be a while before the SE-110 base is set up by FICSIT so definitely start with Norwick

What if I move my Etherwind and Nascent setups into SE-110 before they do. Then I'll have H2O, crops, FP, and INC all in the same system

[24-Sep-23 04:09 PM] exeler#0000
I have a whole base making NS. If you throw up an order for NS I can provide enough for a few 500/500 HYF bases


[24-Sep-23 04:55 PM] fremen45#0000
that's part of my longer term strategy. I don't need NS as of right now. that base will also provide FLX for my SME bases.


[24-Sep-23 05:06 PM] exeler#0000
Oh! You're looking for H2O for a CHP base that'll make NS/FLX/etc?


[24-Sep-23 05:13 PM] fremen45#0000
yeah well that and I have a HAL->CL base that takes H2O as well.

@fremen45 can I get a regular BER supply from you from IY-206c?  Happy to provide materials for a base expansion


[02-Oct-23 10:11 AM] fremen45#0000
How much BER do you need? Rn I was planning on closing IY-306c. However I do have SE-648b as a BER supplier.


[02-Oct-23 11:16 AM] melon164#0000
Um, 270/d?  😁


[02-Oct-23 11:16 AM] fremen45#0000
is that steady?


[02-Oct-23 11:18 AM] fremen45#0000
I'm asking because if it is then I would have to run a second permit just to handle your BER Load and you are not the only person I am supplying.

[03-Oct-23 11:12 AM] fremen45#0000

[03-Oct-23 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
SE-110b is the HYF planet, SE-110d will be the INC planet.


[03-Oct-23 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not involved with SE-110d... and it just lost 16 workers last week.. so


[03-Oct-23 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
maybe someone should reach out to harpercz, there's no infrastructure there so I'm not sure what they are doing


[03-Oct-23 01:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
KW-602a is also, apparently, being made into a HYF planet


[04-Oct-23 11:21 PM] tuffyless#0000
KW-020d too with an Agri CoGC.
Which is close to KW-020c (Milliways) with a Food CoGC.


[04-Oct-23 11:23 PM] tuffyless#0000
KW-602c is a Food CoGC ... Etherwind feeds the H2O


[04-Oct-23 11:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
KW-688d makes the NS for HYF's, with N input from Biogenesis or ZV-639d.


[04-Oct-23 11:31 PM] tuffyless#0000
Currently my Etherwind base feeds H2O to a 602c FP base which makes DW.  And my KW-688d base feeds NS to a future HYF base around KW sys.  
The N for the NS on 688d will come from my ZV-639d base.
The LST for the NS on 639d will come from my KW-688d base.
Round-trip for inputs.


[05-Oct-23 10:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you build 31 INCs on a single fresh planet and start them all at once on the HCP recipe, when they all finish their first production cycle, you get two experts at once

Why no one mines AMM and HE on `ZV-639e`?


[09-Oct-23 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
because high gravity is hard to deal with, and just mining basic resources on a planet with 2x malus is going to give really bad returns


[09-Oct-23 09:19 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Looks like people are doing it on ZV-759e


[09-Oct-23 09:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000
In the end, does CoGC matter that much?


[09-Oct-23 09:42 AM] melon164#0000
only 25% 😝


[09-Oct-23 09:43 AM] mrsmith33#0000
When you are fully vertically integrated the only money that do matter is tax payments. Other than that it would be fully closed system, where the price of everything is zero


[09-Oct-23 09:45 AM] melon164#0000
You are usually base capacity limited, though, so CoGC alignment allows you to produce 25% more of whatever _from the same base area_


[09-Oct-23 09:47 AM] mrsmith33#0000
So, is the ideal way to organize everything is to only have 500 area bases, only build one kind of buildings that matches experts/CoGC?


[09-Oct-23 09:47 AM] fremen45#0000
I think you might want to think about consumable costs for sub products. And possibly shipping costs if you want to get an accurate cost picture.


[09-Oct-23 09:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm including that too (consumables, fuel, building degradation, ship repairs, taxes)


[09-Oct-23 09:50 AM] mrsmith33#0000
You need to sell enough to cover taxes and everything you are buying


[09-Oct-23 09:52 AM] tuffyless#0000
I agree with melon about base capacity limitation makes CoGC important.

For example, my next permit for another base is taking forever to get.  
So not being able to expand so fast anymore, makes you wanna relook at the existing setup and enhance it.  CoGC enter stage.


[09-Oct-23 09:55 AM] tuffyless#0000
That optimization is as you say a 500 area of population getting the CoGC bonus.  Then shipping logistics is another factor it seems


[09-Oct-23 09:56 AM] tuffyless#0000
btw...ZV-639e is a PLI on my 'want to get' list. 🙂

[09-Oct-23 09:58 AM] churavis#0000
This depends on whether you are optimizing for production and efficiency or for logistical simplicity


[09-Oct-23 10:01 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Should resources be mined on Resource extraction planets?


[09-Oct-23 10:02 AM] tuffyless#0000
So the more boats with gas that you have the more likely you'll be angled toward production & efficiency.?.


[09-Oct-23 10:03 AM] mrsmith33#0000
If you play Pro only, then shipping is not an issue, I guess


[09-Oct-23 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
High efficiency also means you get more output per unit of consumables that your workers consume


[09-Oct-23 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also you get more output per building repair, so repair costs are lower too.


[09-Oct-23 01:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's a multiplicative 25%, so with experts it can actually be a good bit more


[09-Oct-23 01:47 PM] mrsmith33#0000
You get 160.5% total

it's 1 * 1.25 * 1.28 rather than 1 * (1 + .25 + .28)


[09-Oct-23 01:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
right so it's 160 - 128=32%

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Oct-23 02:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
And in cases where upkeep costs are high, it can be a big deal:
At 100% efficiency, an AML takes 14h24m to make 1 W from 5 BTS.
During that time your workforce will consume 4213 AIC and the AML will degrade 3690 AIC. BTS is a static cost (assume you bought it from me for 350/u: 1750 total).

That's 9653 AIC spent per W. 

 Let's pretend you sell it for 11k, that's ~1400 AIC in profit.

But if you pick a good COGC and experts, at 160% efficiency:
Degradation: $2299
Workforce: $2625
Input BTS: $1750 (unchanged)

That's 6674 AIC per W. Sell at 11k and your profit is $4300 per W }
(and you make it faster too!) 

So that's like a 6 fold profit on the AML per day once you calculate in the time savings too. 

That's why I really really try to align with COGCs, especially where buildings and workforce are expensive


[13-Oct-23 04:46 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Sorry to be late to the party, but following the COGC is like having an extra 1/4 permit on the base, without having to pay for consumables, degradation or repairs. Only you can know if that extra production & cost saving is worth it for you.


[15-Oct-23 11:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those ship auctions EV1L has been running have been getting crazy high prices. If anyone here wants to buy up OOG ship parts at an external prices for ship auctions, I would support that. I have an absolute ton of LFE/SFE/MFE and FFCs.

I've also sent a ship and will be setting up a base to purely make AEF. At 45 units/day, I think I can easily supply the corp's needs and also make AEF available to the general market at a reasonable price.

Yes, unemployed POPs will keep going up if you keep feeding them. I find a balance of around 5-10% unemployed is a good target.
Also, high unemployed PIOs & SETs will make growing TECH & ENG harder, since you first have to feed the unemployed of the lower classes before the upper classes will get fed and grow. This isn't an issue right now but could be in the future.


[31-Oct-23 06:43 AM] domicius#0000
OK. I'll be less generous.


[31-Oct-23 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
The QF/NG region is very interesting, it looks to be one of the most remote areas in the universe and it has some decent resources and many temperate planets


[31-Oct-23 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's super far away though, I think any ships making the long haul regularly would need to run HYR or HPRs. They'd go to a midway point with a level 3 warehouse for storing fuel so they could make the jumps in about 2 days at the cost of about 4k FF


[31-Oct-23 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
but if only complex finished products come out, that fuel overhead would be miniscule


[31-Oct-23 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000

HAL - NG-164d - 19.1 - SEA + INS
LST - NG-848b - 47.24 - TSH
TIO - RV-276a - 20.43 - HSE + TSH (9th highest in universe)
SIO - QF-930c - 50.04 - none
CUO - NG-574b - 20.60 - SEA
H - QF-564e - 41.64 - INS (5th highest)
HE - QF-497f - 22.21 - INS (8th highest)
O - RV-854d - 43.26 - HSE (the highest)
AMM - QF-899h/QF-497e - 41.41 - INS (2nd highest)
BRM - QF-930c - 28.88 - none
fertile - QF-930b

if they bump up some resources or add some more fertility, I don't see why an outpost with several bases clustered in the area wouldn't make sense

Start a trend of selling entertainment "cruises" to people.

Is this only relevant when doing STL flight within the system, or FLT jump is affected too?


[05-Nov-23 08:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
Sublight flights


[07-Nov-23 12:55 PM] mrsmith33#0000
@higgsy What's you ALO/AL setup?


[07-Nov-23 01:12 PM] higgsy#0000
Currently 1 permit on Nascent just for ALO and 3 on Deimos for AL. I'm in the process of splitting AL between Vulcan and Deimos to save a permit.


[07-Nov-23 01:13 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I see. I currently do C on Nascent. Will need to move it somewhere else


[07-Nov-23 01:17 PM] higgsy#0000
I have 3 permits on YK-005d for C


[07-Nov-23 01:25 PM] mrsmith33#0000
ZV-759g looks like perfect place for C, that is near both Ant and Harmonia.
Though in the long term I should probably use Harmonia for food crops instead of for C. And do HYF for carbon plants somewhere else


[07-Nov-23 01:35 PM] mrsmith33#0000
So, SE-110b is already Agriculture CoGC, that is near water source (SE-110c). Might also make (SE-110d) a resource extraction one and have a whole chain in one system


[07-Nov-23 01:48 PM] mrsmith33#0000
And resulting C price is the same as on Nascent with GRN from Harmonia


[07-Nov-23 01:49 PM] mrsmith33#0000
and 1 HYF planet produces 3.3x HCP than 1 C base needs


[07-Nov-23 01:55 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I can set 3 C bases in that system


[07-Nov-23 04:59 PM] mrsmith33#0000
The next 2 bases will be Chem base on ZV-639d + YK-005d HAL mining


[07-Nov-23 05:00 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Cheap fertilizers is the way to go


[07-Nov-23 05:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
since SE-110c is also resource extraction (which is what INCs use), some people could set up two INC bases in system


[07-Nov-23 05:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
FCST is supposed to be setting up SE-110d as something


[07-Nov-23 05:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
but they have not made much progress on that it seems


[07-Nov-23 05:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah their plan was d to be INCs and SE-110a to be FPs


[07-Nov-23 05:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
but we could roll in and build out either of those planets


[08-Nov-23 03:13 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Using SE-110c for anything other than water is just a crime


[09-Nov-23 04:07 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Is it better to specialize construction bases, or to mix more construction buildings per base?


[09-Nov-23 04:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
I just put all mine together


[09-Nov-23 04:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
would be annoying moving around fabs


[09-Nov-23 04:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
then you accidentally spend them on a build and now your pp3s run dry 😮


[09-Nov-23 04:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
instead I just pull out as many of all levels until they're all <10 and take the excesses for sale/use


[09-Nov-23 04:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
I only use Nike for construction though


[12-Nov-23 12:52 PM] mrsmith33#0000
What's the best software planet?


[12-Nov-23 12:56 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Seems like software and actual electronics should be on different bases


[12-Nov-23 01:44 PM] melon164#0000
For SD I just put them anywhere, especially places where I'm trying to build up or maintain TEC population but don't currently actually need TEC buildings there (I've got a few on KI-401a for instance).


[12-Nov-23 04:51 PM] churavis#0000
Phobos and Antares 1 a will be the closest electronics COGC planets


[14-Nov-23 02:22 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I need second Food planet (for DW?)


[14-Nov-23 04:20 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm considering doing it on one of the gas planets in ZV-639. Which is near H2O source


[14-Nov-23 07:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
KW-602c is near etherwind and somewhat near ISA, that's an option. SE-110a will eventually be a FP planet, but no one has started it, so it's probably not a great choice unless you want to be that person 😄


[14-Nov-23 07:02 AM] mrsmith33#0000
SE-110a is a good idea, yeah


[15-Nov-23 12:44 PM] higgsy#0000

3 CLR, 1 ECA, 1 ELP, 1 EDM, 4 SD, 2 SE, 1 SL
and have 55 area left


[18-Nov-23 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's super close to what I do


[18-Nov-23 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
My ECA makes a lot of CBL, and that can take a lot of LI + BE + HCC, so if you are doing that, be readyt for it


[18-Nov-23 10:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
Also really close to mine, I have 5 SD and no EDM

Need plan for Construction base that produces PP4 mats.
Current idea is 4 PP2, 4 PP3, 3 PP4


[20-Nov-23 03:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Nike seems much better for PP4, since it has better infra


[20-Nov-23 03:29 PM] churavis#0000
As a general rule, you'll need 1 PP3 for each PP4


[20-Nov-23 03:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Maybe it is better to ship lower tier goods


[20-Nov-23 03:30 PM] churavis#0000
I use A3B for extra construction space


[20-Nov-23 03:30 PM] mrsmith33#0000

Yeah, put the low-tier buildings on Antares III b, and the fancy ones on Nike

You'll never sell that many and have 5mil in capital before earning anything 😅


[20-Nov-23 06:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
And you'll need at least 2 chem planets to support that I think, not to mention a KV planet, so more like 3 chem planets


[20-Nov-23 06:37 PM] churavis#0000
I have 3 chem planets and they support more than just my 4 PP4


[20-Nov-23 06:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah but 9 pp4 is more than twice that!


[20-Nov-23 06:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
I feel like I always need more chem planets though, I'm parked on every available one in ant space


[22-Nov-23 04:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Does anyone feel like joining me out on Ant IIg to supply more H?  Not that I mind bleeding everyone on the CX for my H, but eventually it's going to start feeding through into prices of things like PE and PG.


[22-Nov-23 04:22 PM] churavis#0000
Rune has a pretty good supply. One base on KI-401d can produce quite a lot of H if you have the shipping to get it out of there


[22-Nov-23 04:25 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I produce over 750/day on IIg, but that's not enough to keep the CX price stable


[23-Nov-23 09:27 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Are people using NAB recipe for SF?
If yes, do you mine BOR?
If yes, are you doing it on Electronica?

should I also sell some on the CX to help stabilize the price?


[28-Nov-23 03:54 PM] rune_242#0000
or should sell it in corp to keep the price high to get more people making H?

EW-238c has a dormant COGC, and I'll happily build one on WU-974c if someone will reliably vote them


[01-Dec-23 03:50 AM] melon164#0000
Not being able to vote for COGCs is the worst BASIC limitation, IMO, worse than the two-ships

[09-Dec-23 03:20 PM] mrsmith33#0000
WU-070a, Etherwind, Aratora, Norwick


[09-Dec-23 03:22 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Of course, why didn't I think of Norwick, I already have a food production base there that isn't using the full 500.  Time to build some EXT


[09-Dec-23 03:53 PM] churavis#0000
WU-070a is designed to be a glass production planet as well as SIO extracting and smelting. It has a metallurgy COGC and is MCG only. It's far away but glass is lightweight


[09-Dec-23 04:28 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ah, cool.  I will give it a look


[09-Dec-23 04:38 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Might be worth going for that.  At the moment I'm extracting HAL onsite on IId, which puts my NA very convenient for Deimos, but I've been thinking of reconfiguring IId as well, moving HAL extraction to YK-005d and PE production to Hephestus


[09-Dec-23 04:39 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Doesn't look like the WU-070a governor actually contributes anything?

WU-070a is so small it doesn't need a governor. The current governor has been there since forever but afaik Chur feeds the COGC.


[14-Dec-23 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems like that governor doesn't do the POPI either


[14-Dec-23 05:56 PM] churavis#0000
I feed the POPI too. It would be nice to get the taxes but they're not a lot

[15-Dec-23 07:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh to fill in @cleavingambiguity, my vague plan for colonizing OS-099 is based on the fact that it's the only system with 3 cheaply habitable planets (MCG or SEA only) in the whole universe. It's 4 jumps from GM-498 which is a really good water planet- one of the best in the game, although it has some expensive materials. Downside is that there isn't much for great materials in the region, or something to do with them. No fertility nearby, so crops would be in HYFs. 

So... that leaves you with your choice of 3x COGCs in one system. Maybe the best you can do is make 3 electronics bases and farm EDC/IDC there, since that's a minimal shipping thing. But you'd be starting the POPI from scratch, so it's probably better to do that in already colonized space, just spread out. 

Trying hard to find any plausable case for going out there

An update to my ongoing OS-099 work. I made my planet search python script mark the top 5 locations for each resource type. It takes into account the penalty for Mineral water vs. liquid water, for example. It doesn't take into account the habitability of those planets though.


[01-Jan-24 11:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
It turns out that there are some pretty good resources available around OS-099. In particular, one of the best O planets, one of the best H2O planets, and really good sources for TIO, LST, ALO, HE, FEo, and LIO.

The map seems upside down or sideways


[01-Jan-24 11:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
The first "detail map" is just the bottom right section of the big map. It doesn't really communicate where it's cut off


[01-Jan-24 11:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
The second map should line up with your  expectations approximately of where things are positioned compared to the game map... just shifted around so the lines and dots don't overlap or cross over as much as they do in-game


[01-Jan-24 11:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
It would be nice to weigh the haitability of a planet vs. the richness of the resource somehow, but that's a value judgement that I haven't made. So you'll note that etherwind doesn't technically make the cut for H2O


[01-Jan-24 11:13 PM] churavis#0000
Acetares should be to the left of Antares I not the right and Antares II should be to the right and down, not up and left.

[01-Jan-24 11:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, as far as growing an industry in OS-099... there is H2O, so you _could_ make carbon down there and smelt some highly available ores. I don't think that really gets you too far since H2O -> HYFs -> INCs -> SMEs is 4 planets already and then you gotta ship the metal back.. so that's a crappy chain to pursue.  Having better ALO/FEO/LST than Nike/Vulcan/Deimos doesn't really buy you that much if it's that far away. 

Chemistry would be a better chain to move down there, more value, less shipping back and forth... more value in having many planets. But the gasses aren't really there.

So that leaves the idea of putting 3 software farms on OS-099


[01-Jan-24 11:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is definitely still a solution looking for a problem 😄


[01-Jan-24 11:29 PM] churavis#0000
How long would it take to build up the high-tier population for the software farms?

[15-Jan-24 11:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Se-110a is food industries, SE-110b is our HYF planet, which is growing well.


[15-Jan-24 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
SE-110d is resource extraction - mostly for more INCs

Can we put together a list of recruitment standards?


[23-Jan-24 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been thinking we should have some for a while. I think in my views, I mostly want someone who communicates regularly and coherently and are involved in the corp. At least 2/3rds of their bases in ANT space or something similar..? 

I've only ever invited pro/basic users. I think that's a good requirement. 

Giving out my ANT development grants has been a nice way to strike up conversations and see if people are on a good track before considering sending them an invite. 

I often ask about their plans or goals, not because it's important that they have any specific goal, but it's nice if they have some coherent thinking on the topic- assuming they've been playing long enough to understand the game. If they are gonna stick around for more than a month or two, they should have an interest in working together on ship parts, governing, finance / loans / market making, or some kind of personal project. 

Since the content has been pretty slow from the devs, I think a lot of us are in semi-retirement. Unfortunately that turns into a slow ship into totally inactive and people don't leave the corp when they quit. I'm not really upset about it cause it's sort of inevitable and understandable. But it's hard to track how many members are inactive so I don't know if we should be recruiting.


[23-Jan-24 01:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh, the other thing I always do is check their message history in the Prosperous Universe and UFO discords, you can get a good sense of someone from that often

I think if we have something moderately robust, we could even list for open enrollment. I know we have 35 members listed, but I think the active count is a fair bit lower. But since the activity change, the FIO API doesn't have any activity information


[24-Jan-24 04:45 PM] churavis#0000
It might be better to have a more formal enrollment process instead of just whoever happens to interact with a member

I've been making AIR as an MM, due to excess APF production, but I think it's actually a pretty good choice


[05-Feb-24 11:51 PM] allocater#0000
updated report, technically those 3 are still profit, so we can keep going 🤷‍♂️

in the local chat on Ice Station Alpha Harpercz is asking whether we use discord.
i assume he wants to join our discord as a guest for better coordination.


[06-Feb-24 04:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
well, I'm willing to set up the roles required for guests. It's come up a few times but we avoided it. Thoughts? @allocater  ? Alternatively whatever he's asking about might be suited for the Antares Development Initative... although I don't want to push off all our projects into third parties 🤷‍♂️


[07-Feb-24 01:36 PM] allocater#0000
Yeah, I support guest roles.

[07-Feb-24 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay my plan then is to make the Logistics and Planets and Shipyard categories be visible to "OOG Shareholders" only. Then "guests" (or people without the "OOG Shareholder" role will get the Public category. I'll roll the fuel-ops channel into logistics and remove the planet specific ones cause they haven't gotten any use. Then that'll be less clicking when I set up permissions. I might do the same with ship-status too, in fact...


[07-Feb-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah I don't think I have "manage channels" permissions though


[07-Feb-24 02:11 PM] allocater#0000
you don't? govs should have it

[07-Feb-24 02:13 PM] allocater#0000

[07-Feb-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, works now, thanks


[07-Feb-24 03:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, those changes are made, except ship-status is special and I can't touch it.


[07-Feb-24 03:02 PM] churavis#0000
We'll want to be careful about what we say in the public channels


[07-Feb-24 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, do you think there should be a separate "guest" channel, and we change "general" to be a private one?


[07-Feb-24 03:03 PM] churavis#0000
That would probably be easier than scrubbing General

{Reactions}

[07-Feb-24 03:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
@Deleted User  is a trial member, he can see all the channels.  Trial members have green names so we can remember to invite them after a while. I did double check to make sure everyone else had the shareholder role, so we should be good there.


[07-Feb-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is what guests (and new joins to the server) will see:

[07-Feb-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Allocater will have to fix oog-c-suite and #ship-status I guess


[07-Feb-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I might freshen up the rules / welcome posts... unless someone else wants to


[07-Feb-24 03:11 PM] churavis#0000
The Welcome and Rules-FAQ channels aren't relevant to guests and we probably don't want corp prices to be public


[07-Feb-24 03:11 PM] churavis#0000
I would say move them and make a guest-welcome-rules one


[07-Feb-24 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ohhhh didn't see that sheet in there. Yeah it would be nice to have posts for prospective members to see, but that is somewhat separate from "new members" page.


[07-Feb-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess I can't mess with #welcome or #rules-faq either.


[07-Feb-24 03:35 PM] exeler#0000
Would we want guests to be able to access #orders to create orders for things?

Or maybe a guest only orders/auctions channel that we can use as a store front of sorts?


[07-Feb-24 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I expect it to be infrequent enough they can do it without the bot.


[07-Feb-24 03:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since a guest would probably be doing something like setting up a repeating sale/purchase of HAL or asking about something complicated like a whole ship


[07-Feb-24 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
is there anything in regards to being a trial member I need to do? pretty sure you mentioned a week trial which I think has elapsed

[07-Feb-24 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope, you just gotta make it a whole week without being awful 😄

So congrats! I have sent you an invite in-game


[07-Feb-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
We're gonna have a formal rule or plan or system sometime soon (tm)


[07-Feb-24 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
gotcha, quick question, does each new term reset the collected income of a planet even if you remain the governor?


[07-Feb-24 04:27 PM] churavis#0000
No, it's only if the governor changes


[07-Feb-24 04:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
ah, that solves that worry then


[09-Feb-24 11:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, the channel cleanup is complete. 
The two #public-welcome and #public-general are visible to guests. All of the recruitment and general rules are in public-welcome. The #shareholders-welcome  contains the more internal information, including things trial members will need to know. 

Everything else is restricted to shareholders and trial members (there's nothing trial members can't see). Any Governor can post to the welcome channels to update rules, but generally it's a read-only channel. 

If everything looks goods, @allocater  can remove/archive #rules-faq #welcome #ship-status  and #oog-c-suite. Those I don't have permission to touch I guess.  (I think if you assign me the Mod role, I will be able to)

[09-Feb-24 11:40 AM] allocater#0000
the mod role isn't really set up and unused, but all those channels should now be invisible for members


[09-Feb-24 11:41 AM] churavis#0000
We should have multiple active members with the mod role in case something happens to one of them

[09-Feb-24 11:46 AM] allocater#0000
if yes, we can give it to more people


[09-Feb-24 11:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, the Mod role seems to have all permissions, but I think it makes sense to have a few (3ish?) people with that role


[09-Feb-24 01:09 PM] emperyan11#0000
Hey? What is the "Governor" roll? Is that Discord admin / mod?


[09-Feb-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's sort of like a mod-lite role. It mostly gives you blue names and the ability to change the planet roles for people. And a little channel editing ability, although I'm not sure what that consists of


[09-Feb-24 05:19 PM] emperyan11#0000
Ah, gotcha! Thanks @archielvahr


[09-Feb-24 05:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
No one was really setting the role consistently anyway 🤷‍♂️  So it's an open question what it should be


[10-Feb-24 10:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
Honestly since allocator is the bank, if he leaves there'd be more than just discord trouble 🫠

I'm planning to setup a chemistry base for PG. Where is the best place to do this? And where do you get your MG/MGS?


[18-Feb-24 08:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I do it on Elon, and buy MG locally from @churavis


[18-Feb-24 08:43 AM] mrsmith33#0000
`ZV-759d` has MGS and is Chem CoGC, if you want to make your own MG


[19-Feb-24 05:33 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I manufacture PG on Ant IId


[19-Feb-24 05:33 PM] draconisdomini#0000
And produce my own MG


[19-Feb-24 05:34 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I always have spare MG so I can sell some to you if you want to set up a base there


[21-Feb-24 09:13 PM] tuffyless#0000
Have been working with lukeskye (current gov of Elon) to build up PLI QJ-382a, which is in the neighboring system of Elon.

I donated alot of goods for ADM + COG.  
Warehouse is prolly next in time.

The plan is to make it a manufacturing CoGC, with the supply of MGS.
Claim your plot before it's gone.  🙂

Is it better to have FER on the base where RAT is made (Norwick) or where DW is made (SE-110a)?


[29-Feb-24 01:39 PM] mrsmith33#0000
SE-110a seems better, because I produce CAF on SE-110b


[29-Feb-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. Also check to see if which planet has available settlers


[01-Mar-24 12:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah FER take more expensive pops


[01-Mar-24 12:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
better to put them on Norwick because of that availability

How about adding a Discord Role to mark players that have quit?


[07-Mar-24 12:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's a good idea. I thought we had a "retired" role but I guess not!


[07-Mar-24 12:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay I made the role, but I haven't marked everyone. That'll be a big job I think 😬


[07-Mar-24 12:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Anyone who retires will get a light grey name instead of blue/white, and they will continue to have access to everything since they will also keep the shareholder role

why do you need supporter level for an activity tracker? and what's with the section after creation date?


[10-Mar-24 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
just curious


[10-Mar-24 12:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh a few notes, those are the fields right out of FIO. They are a little buggy for users who have recycled CO names. And the creation date from FIO is wrong for people who have COLIQ'd or have a reused company code. Unfortunately there's no easy fix for that on the fio side. 

I also hand cleaned up old members, so if anyone is missing that's me just messing up some data.


[10-Mar-24 12:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
I had started listing planet data esp for the messed up accounts but it was too much work so I stopped


[10-Mar-24 12:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
the last column is the number of days active reported in the USR in-game buffer, which isn't in FIO yet.


[10-Mar-24 12:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
The original rule of OOG was to leave the corp if you went inactive to prevent dilution of dividends on people who won't use them.. but it's tough to stay on top of that.


[10-Mar-24 12:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
with no ability to remove people I imagine it'd be very hard


[10-Mar-24 12:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaaaaaaaah, I think I'll ping some of them in discord tomorrow and see how that goes.


[10-Mar-24 12:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh and the pro/basic also determines if / when your inactive account will be removed too.


[11-Mar-24 12:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send out DMs to some of the inactive people tomorrow to see what's up and if they want to retire, etc. Maybe we should have a way to make it easier for people to liquidate assets, open to ideas there. Since the dividend is ~250k now, I'm guessing there's a lot of liquid cash tied up in people who aren't playing. 🤷‍♂️


[14-Mar-24 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is it just me or does the FX market actually move pretty fast? The FXPC doesn't render for me at all

Progress Update - Development Log #430 | Prosperous Universe
Reading our devlogs on a weekly basis gives you a good idea about what we are currently up to. It is easy though to lose sight of the big picture and our medium term goals. With this devlog we want to recap what happened in the last months and what happens next.

Any thoughts on trying to recruit a few people from the ADI discord? It worked out pretty well with australis 🙂


[17-Apr-24 10:46 AM] katinga#0000
what's ADI?


[17-Apr-24 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
There's a few people in there that have played for ~90 days and are pretty active. I'm probably also biased because they buy my rations

Antares Development Initiative - @Deleted User (sry for ping) started it to give grants to new players (including myself, months ago 🙂 )


[17-Apr-24 11:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
I sell a lot to Uncle_Leslie69 and Hal98. I think either / both of them would be a good fit


[17-Apr-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, it is a really good group overall. And reaching out to individuals you've worked with is great.

I've been neglecting some recruitment guidelines and I've also been thinking of putting up a public post. I do want to stay on top of the inevitable churn


[17-Apr-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Recruitment Spiel:

We are the premier corporation in Antares space and the largest governance organization in the universe. As a corporation, we work to ensure the stability of the Antares region, as well as creating a fun and engaging place for our members to enjoy Prosperous Universe. Our corporation includes weekly dividends in excess of 200k AIC, governance training and support, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities, including base teleports. Our friendly group has members that are active in all timezones.

Recruitment Guidelines:

OOG is a highly selective corp with limited available positions. We're looking for members who:

* Interested in being a team player and being active in the corp and community
* Are primarily based in ANT space
* Have a Pro License and plan to maintain it
* Bonus: Interest in planetary governance, or are already a governor.

------------------

How we internally evaluate candidates on those guidelines:

* 30 Days of overall game experience
* Current Pro License and plans to maintain it
* 80% of bases in Antares sphere of influence
* The ability to communicate in English
* A team player attitude 
* Active in other PRUN discords

Nice to have:
* Decent growth to company age ratio
* They have an interest in governance.
* They have cool side projects (maintain tools, run in-game development projects, well known to the community, etc)
* They're already a governor somewhere.


[17-Apr-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
How's that sound?


[17-Apr-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then maybe we have a recruitment channel for discussing members


[17-Apr-24 11:53 AM] sidepipe#0000

[17-Apr-24 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I think they are generally flexible, if they demonstrate other outstanding features, like you did 😉


[17-Apr-24 11:57 AM] katinga#0000
It's reasonable guidelines, though.


[17-Apr-24 12:05 PM] katinga#0000
TBH, I'm fixing to shut down my base there at Proxion.  it's terribly inconvenient to move materials to and from there to even Etherwind, much less my ANT area bases.  The reason I put my base there at Proxion pretty much no longer applies.  I plan to move operations of that base to Demeter.  Then move my burners from Etherwind to Nascent.


[17-Apr-24 12:06 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I have Harmonia and Demeter for GRN and HER


[17-Apr-24 12:07 PM] churavis#0000
Fertile planets are in short supply and you can always build more ships

Life is an option if you want to go the HYP route.  I may set up there just so I can channel my inner Marvin the manically depressed robot

the point of ADI is to be seperate from any Corp with no real obligations - I'm not sure how I feel it being used to recruit people specifically


[17-Apr-24 02:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's fair 🙂


[17-Apr-24 02:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
maybe I phrased it badly, I meant more that I was considering recruiting some specific folks that are in the discord. not like targeting ADI specifically for recruitment


[17-Apr-24 02:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
in that case I'd be fine with it


[17-Apr-24 02:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
more specifically uncle_leslie and hal98 - see #recruitment-discussion. I just interact with them a lot there, so I got the feeling they'd fit in well here as well. If I do reach out to them, I can make it clear that they wouldn't need to stop doing anything they're already doing in/for ADI


[17-Apr-24 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's fine, the way I thought it was worded seemed as if it was targeted and just straight up poaching, which didn't sit right at all


[17-Apr-24 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
both of them were going to be apart of something I was working on a more serious basis  but the choice is up to them at the end of the day


[17-Apr-24 06:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, reading it back I understand why you got that impression 😅 

and if that project is what I think it is, I don't think membership in OOG would preclude participating in that. especially since I have a bunch of excess HAL that might be useful 🙂

Are 3 EXT enough to feed 9 SME or are you importing ore as well?


[24-Apr-24 03:53 PM] mrsmith33#0000
SME is for lots of ores, not just for AUO


[24-Apr-24 03:53 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, but anything else you'll have to import


[24-Apr-24 03:53 PM] mrsmith33#0000
And from those I will do alloys on FS


[24-Apr-24 03:53 PM] mrsmith33#0000

[25-Apr-24 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ah yeah I believe so


[25-Apr-24 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I have like 150 LFEs, and a pretty decent number of MFE, SFE, FFC- more than I can sell. Which makes me think maybe we should start selling ship packages externally again. 

1) Do other ship component makers have an overload of components they can't sell?
2) Does anyone want to manage ship sales contracts? (it's a bazillion clicks). I might be interested in that if some PMMG features come to pass.


[25-Apr-24 01:10 PM] melon164#0000
I make a massive overage of engines, I think I have 15-20M worth


[25-Apr-24 01:11 PM] melon164#0000
I've paused making QCR because I have so many


[25-Apr-24 01:12 PM] melon164#0000
and I stopped my LCB/WCB production line in KI-401 system for the same reason


[25-Apr-24 01:13 PM] melon164#0000
So I'd happily participate in a shipyard program, although obviously I can't help with the clickwork 😭


[25-Apr-24 01:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay that's cool. I've definitely got the capital to buy parts and hold them for ship sale


[25-Apr-24 01:15 PM] allocater#0000
I wonder if we would offer package for the exact price on ANT CX, if people would buy it 😄


[25-Apr-24 01:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly I think so


[25-Apr-24 01:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Apr-24 01:25 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Why not sell in bulk, so others have to do the clicks?


[25-Apr-24 01:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
We used to sell ready-to-assemble ships, but moved to individually putting stuff on the CX so anyone could assemble their own ships (with their own clicks). But I've begun to suspect that there are people who have money and want ships, but don't want to mess around with individually buying components from the CX, even when they are usually all in stock.


[25-Apr-24 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the complexity is a turn off for some people - too many ship options, too many things to buy, not obviously clear they are all available unless you check all the order books.


[25-Apr-24 01:31 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Sounds like the same number of clicks for the buyer


[25-Apr-24 01:33 PM] melon164#0000
with a package the seller assumes most of the risk of misunderstanding what the bill of materials is


[25-Apr-24 01:33 PM] katinga#0000
I would really appreciate ready to assemble ships like Eve does, with just different configurations.  Or a system where players can put out requests for what they want in the whole ship?


[25-Apr-24 01:34 PM] melon164#0000
buying million-credit materials with little liquidity requires careful clicking


[25-Apr-24 01:34 PM] melon164#0000
don't want to buy BR2 instead of BR1 or LFL instead of LFE


[25-Apr-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or they buy almost all the parts and they find out there's suddenly no BR2s on the market


[25-Apr-24 01:35 PM] melon164#0000
Whereas the shipwright is familiar with those materials and knows which one is correct


[25-Apr-24 01:36 PM] melon164#0000
also that


[25-Apr-24 01:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
If I were to do it, I would just buy 10x of our OOG Standard 2k ship (Carrier in Churavis-speak). Then solicit parts from the corp at your choice external price, then offer them for sale with a markup as "immediately available". You can get cheap ships from current manufacturers, but there's a 3 month wait. Worst case, I assemble them for myself 😛

{Reactions}
🤨 

[25-Apr-24 01:39 PM] katinga#0000
I remember in Eve, you'd buy the ship, then put it together, and could configure it with different modules.  maybe they could make the ship industry here more modular on a whole?


[25-Apr-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
eh maybe. that is paperwork though, and if it involves removing a BR1 and adding a BR2, then it's a bit more annoying. If they wanna add fancy seats, they can do that, probably on their own


[25-Apr-24 01:42 PM] katinga#0000
ship building menus.  offer some standards.  if players want a more custom job, they'd have to request it with specs?


[25-Apr-24 01:46 PM] katinga#0000
they could redo the shipyard system to request builds AT the shipyards.  You already use shipyards to design blueprints


[25-Apr-24 01:53 PM] melon164#0000
I wish there was a decent in-game system for doing auctions


[25-Apr-24 01:53 PM] melon164#0000
it's basically impossible to get a market price for whole ships


[25-Apr-24 02:04 PM] mrsmith33#0000
The lack of Quality of Life changes constantly motivates to develop my own game, but I'm successfully resisting the urge.


[25-Apr-24 02:07 PM] melon164#0000

I can't really play a game where my very expensive space ship is on a 4 hour long operation, and I am basically assured of losing it if I have to quit or pause before the operation ends.  But I used to like it okay

Which is good, because I forgot to bring CoGC consumables, and bad because I wanted it to be Metallurgy


[25-Apr-24 04:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
"Highlander shipping" offers our 2k/2k ship for 2.75M. But they have a 6 month backlog.

Rise charges 4.4 million AIC for a 2k/2k

Our in-corp price is 4.6m. The CX price is around 6m. Of the 1.4m markup, 1.05m of that is on the BR1 and CQM. Those also have the least stock posted on the CX.


[25-Apr-24 04:55 PM] churavis#0000
How much of that BR1 and CQM stock is mine?


[25-Apr-24 04:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
they are both 100% you or allocater 😄

{Reactions}

[25-Apr-24 05:05 PM] melon164#0000
I don't at all understand how they can do the 2k/2k for that price, it's basically no margin anywhere, full vertical integration


[25-Apr-24 05:06 PM] melon164#0000
I wouldn't be surprised to find we could put ten LCB or WCBs together just from our collective stock though

also... is GTU still making ships or are they defunct?


[25-Apr-24 05:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh their sheet says 5.1m and seems up to date


[25-Apr-24 05:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
they seem to be a few months out probably.


[25-Apr-24 05:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
they are short on BR1s and BHPs


[25-Apr-24 05:13 PM] churavis#0000
Would we be short on anything if we started to pump out as many ships as we could?


[25-Apr-24 05:18 PM] melon164#0000
What does "as many as we could" look like?


[25-Apr-24 05:18 PM] melon164#0000
1/d?


[25-Apr-24 05:19 PM] churavis#0000
If we tried to make as much as possible, eventually we hit some kind of bottleneck, what would the bottleneck be?


[25-Apr-24 05:20 PM] melon164#0000
I'm guessing LHP 😝

5 SPF does 1.15/d QCR/FSE


[25-Apr-24 05:25 PM] melon164#0000
so can comfortably deliver 1/d


[25-Apr-24 05:26 PM] melon164#0000
2 APF-FFC


[25-Apr-24 05:27 PM] melon164#0000
but 4 UPF-BR1 and 3 UPF-CQM with lord knows how many PPF to make the sheets


[25-Apr-24 05:30 PM] melon164#0000
so I would guess whichever of bridges or crew quarters is most painful


[25-Apr-24 05:34 PM] churavis#0000
I have 3 UPF that can make 0.65 BR1/CQM combos per day max


[25-Apr-24 05:35 PM] churavis#0000
I could maybe add more UPF if I had a bit of help with PSL/PSM


[25-Apr-24 05:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm I'm probably out of PSL/PSM capacity, but I can make NV1s or LIS slowly


[25-Apr-24 05:37 PM] churavis#0000
I would need still need help with APF products but I figure you still have extra capacity


[25-Apr-24 08:47 PM] tuffyless#0000
Fascinating.  
I can offer up to ELP & SL products currently.  
My PPF output isnt enough to help yet.  😦
Sounds like another permit is needed.


[25-Apr-24 08:54 PM] tuffyless#0000
Am 2 weeks from having 4 permits to play with.

Downsizing Norwick +2 permits plus Griff +1 permit plus +1 HQ upgrade to Lvl28.  All happening ~same time. 

I was gunna put them towards Fuel Prod but could be persuaded to change plans.

[25-Apr-24 09:19 PM] churavis#0000
I've got 10 ships and he's never had trouble providing enough FF or SF

I'll put some time into Excel figuring out how to help with OOG Shipbuilding.  🙂  PPF's at the least?


[25-Apr-24 10:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably hull plates too. Worth checkign how much profit they make at market prices. You might be able to get AL form in corp, but I'm not sure who has excess


[25-Apr-24 10:30 PM] churavis#0000
AL is fairly cheap on the ANT CX and has been for months


[25-Apr-24 10:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
It looks like Tuffy has a bunch on the CX, so maybe he has excess 😄


[25-Apr-24 10:31 PM] exeler#0000
I'm usually swimming in hull plates, are we lacking some?


[25-Apr-24 10:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
you got like 1000 LHP?


[25-Apr-24 10:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
maybe we are collectively sitting on 10+ ships


[25-Apr-24 10:32 PM] exeler#0000
I did: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755/1230322066314760273


[25-Apr-24 10:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh yeah nice!


[25-Apr-24 10:32 PM] exeler#0000
I'm back up to around 500 now


[25-Apr-24 10:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well it sounds like it's just a matter of picking component prices now. Maybe I will do that tomorrow at work 😄


[25-Apr-24 10:38 PM] churavis#0000
So are we doing this for sure? Should I make plans to increase my UPF capacity?


[25-Apr-24 10:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well it seems like we can do a fair bit with our current capacity


[25-Apr-24 10:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since I don't _reaaaaalllly_ know how fast these will sell


[25-Apr-24 10:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
but if we collectively have 10 ships already made, we can sell those without any production changes


[25-Apr-24 10:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
if they all sell in 2 days, we will then know if production changes are warranted


[25-Apr-24 10:39 PM] churavis#0000
The speed at which they sell is determined by price, if they sell too fast we raise prices until they meet production


[25-Apr-24 10:41 PM] exeler#0000
I'd be willing buy up to 2 2k/2k ships, and maybe a third 1k/3k (volume)


[25-Apr-24 10:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm yeah then we need internal vs. external prices


[25-Apr-24 10:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wouldn't want to buy ship parts at the internal price then sell the ships externally - ethically speaking


[25-Apr-24 10:42 PM] exeler#0000
I'm not too worried about the prices. I haven't spent any real money in a while 😅

Not really.  Not a source for AL currently.  That's storage.
Almost ready to put a base full of PP2's on 194b, the AL stockpile will be dwindling fast. 😦

[26-Apr-24 12:51 AM] allocater#0000
I have 15 CQM in storage and let my 3 UPF decay to 33% because nobody is buying. So this can be easily ramped up. BR1 and CQM are no problem.


[26-Apr-24 01:22 AM] allocater#0000
Benten C now more expensive than ANT C 😮


[26-Apr-24 02:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here's my draft of prices. My thought is that I'll pay these rates to buy components in bulk, in the appropriate ratios, then I'll sell them externally at the 5.98m AIC price. I tried to aim high on prices, taking either the higher of the CX price or the GTU price, with some adjustments for the larger differences, and the internal prod price. I wanted to hold it under 6m. But I could be talked out of that. 

So is anyone unhappy with any of these prices? 

125    1x MFL
150    1x MSL
390    2x LFE
180    2x MFE
60    1x SFE
240    94x LHP
55    128x SSC
420    1x LCB
750    1x FSE
700    1x QCR
1300    1x CQM
1100    1x BR1
350    1x FFC    
160    1x Assembly Fee

Ship cost: 5.98m AIC


[26-Apr-24 02:07 PM] churavis#0000
I fear that absolute prices like this will limit your ability to adjust package sell prices based on market conditions or individual negotiations


[26-Apr-24 02:09 PM] churavis#0000
What if it doesn't sell and you want to lower prices, or it's super popular and you need to raise prices?


[26-Apr-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's a good question. Maybe these will be considered flexible first-round prices. I do want to sell from stock that I actually have so I can fulfill them immediately, rather than a "build-to-order" system, where I have to track pending orders and deal with a backlog.


[26-Apr-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm thinking this is a no-backlog, first come first serve, maximum FOMO, minimum bookkeeping situation.


[26-Apr-24 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
ive noticed OOG prices for ships are **much** higher than others ive seen


[26-Apr-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's cause other people are crazy 😄


[26-Apr-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
and have a 6 month backlog apparently (in the case of highland shipyards)


[26-Apr-24 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
in comparison rise would sell that for 3.7m


[26-Apr-24 02:49 PM] katinga#0000
Rise told me he has a backlog, too.  he wants conts with at least a 30 day limit


[26-Apr-24 02:49 PM] churavis#0000
If demand outstrips supply and you don't raise prices, you get a backlog


[26-Apr-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
4.4m I think according to his prices


[26-Apr-24 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
it depends, that's because he's out on holiday atm


[26-Apr-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000

[26-Apr-24 05:27 PM] exeler#0000
What if we added a ship building feature to the bot?

Imagine each ship is a big order and people with the parts can sign up for parts at appropriate prices?

Getting a nice workflow with the discord UI options might be a bit rough, but that sounds like a fun design challenge. Worst case I go nuclear and build a plain website


[26-Apr-24 06:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
part of the issue is the profit margin on the parts is not at all equal


[26-Apr-24 06:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah no idea what to do about that other than solicit feedback


[26-Apr-24 06:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think 1.5yr ago there was a sheet that calculated the profit/hr on each item to try to address that, but that' funky based on area of the buildings and capital cost of the building too


[26-Apr-24 06:14 PM] churavis#0000
The parts are never going to have equal supply and demand


[26-Apr-24 06:15 PM] churavis#0000
There is no such thing as equality because of the cake slice problem


[26-Apr-24 06:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
cost of opportunity is very tricky


[26-Apr-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just want to sell more of what I already have made

{Reactions}
💯 (2) 

[26-Apr-24 06:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe set a flat X% profit per part, or some kind of VAT-equivalent profit calculation that applies a smaller Y% profit per stage


[26-Apr-24 06:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
the second is what I kind of wanted to do for my own production sheets, but I ended up forgetting a lot


[26-Apr-24 06:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
so make TIO? Okay, cost of PIO+EXT degradation + 5%


[26-Apr-24 06:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
TIO -> TI? TIO cost + PIO+SME degradation + 5%


[26-Apr-24 06:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
you could make a whole sheet using just market input consumables


[26-Apr-24 06:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
then assume all products (non-consumable) are made in-house and follow that staged profit


[26-Apr-24 06:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
we could use a basis like that for creating suggested "corp" prices


[26-Apr-24 06:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
doesn't account for opportunity loss against current market conditions though, so it's at the player's discretion whether they use the suggested price


[26-Apr-24 06:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I did make one of those once, but it's got so many caveats that it ended up beingt not too useful (except maybe as a gauge of MM prices, which was sort of the intent). Google sheets was kind of choking on the iterative calculations since I recalculate the price of DW based on the price of the consumables needed to make it, (DW, RAT, COF, Bfabs for EXTs, mats for the FPs, etc). Did the whole thing (except transport costs and taxes).


[26-Apr-24 06:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
And assumed all the materials were extracted from a certain typical but "good" planet.


[26-Apr-24 06:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah that's why you'd have to have some baseline, I was saying consumables but could be any 1 resource


[26-Apr-24 06:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah you can set override prices, which can help with the iteration- it does work without any baseline


[26-Apr-24 06:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
just like newton's method


[26-Apr-24 06:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
I guess you could, but you'd have to allow the calculations to become steady since it's basically an integrator


[26-Apr-24 06:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably why the sheets struggled so much 😄


[26-Apr-24 06:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also did the profit percentage on every MM assuming you're doing the whole chain in-house (including consumables and building supplies). And then did the $ / unit area / day... which actually has pretty different results from the markup


[26-Apr-24 06:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah lol


[26-Apr-24 06:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
unit area can be very hard because HBB vs HB1, excess population due to imbalanced housing, ugh it's just too much


[26-Apr-24 06:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
each base would be different


[26-Apr-24 06:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I assumed HB1/2/3/etc, and pretended they were always evenly split


[26-Apr-24 06:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like 1 EXT is 25 area + (10 AREA / 100 pioneers * 60 Pioneers) = 31 area


[26-Apr-24 06:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
as far as planning a packaged ship to deliver though, I'd be up for following whatever some staged profit chart says


[26-Apr-24 06:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
I feel like there should be an advantage to just buying the parts on the market


[26-Apr-24 06:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, I put a fair bit of work into it and just ended up with a mess 😆

{Reactions}
🐜 

[26-Apr-24 06:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's an interesting thought. anyone could buy them off the market and sell "ship packs". I think we collectively have a lot that isn't listed, which is maybe part of it


[26-Apr-24 06:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I list most of my SKF products, they move a unit a week each typically


[26-Apr-24 06:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
some days like 3 LCB are bought, then 10 days with 0


[26-Apr-24 06:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
as it stands though, there's anywhere from 50-100% profit margin on my SKF products at corp prices, way more at higher (keep in mind, this is basically 2 whole bases for me, 401b and Deimos)


[26-Apr-24 06:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't wan to buy 10 ships worth of parts at a variety of prices and have to price them separately or some-such


[26-Apr-24 06:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
while the engines actually sell much lower profit margins considering their huge complexity


[26-Apr-24 06:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
<100% profit margin


[26-Apr-24 06:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I'll put up 10 orders on the #auctions  channel, then sell 10 ships and we can reconvene


[26-Apr-24 06:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
alright, sounds good. What I'm trying to say though, is prices in your list for goods I can provide are relatively high, so they can come down 10-20% 🙂


[26-Apr-24 06:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
above corp, but doesn't have to be by much


[26-Apr-24 06:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
ahh gotcha 😁  I do want everyone to make a good profit for ships being sold externally

[26-Apr-24 06:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
GTU price, CX price, and internal price are listed in there if you are curious


[26-Apr-24 06:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
GTU prices their fuel tanks and cargo bays fairly far above CX, but their CQM/BR1 quite a bit under


[26-Apr-24 06:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
525,000 for a BR1, while it's 1.3m on the CX


[26-Apr-24 06:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
then there's highlander shipbuilders who charge 2m for the whole thing, but have a 6 month backlog 🤷‍♂️


[26-Apr-24 06:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't even believe that's base cost


[26-Apr-24 06:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
I pulled back the curtain and revealed the cost of the pudding on the sheet as well (for me at least 🙂 ) - absolute base cost, like if I sold any lower I would literally lose money I put in, not even opportunity or anything else


[26-Apr-24 07:09 PM] tuffyless#0000
So ... for those of you producing the final products for ships, what lower level or intermediate MAT / BUI's can help to support you?


[26-Apr-24 07:10 PM] tuffyless#0000
Example Chur mentioned PPF for PSL/PSM for his UPF.  What elses?


[26-Apr-24 07:11 PM] tuffyless#0000
Cuz it sounds like ya'll got the final products pretty much covered.  Extra surpluses, stuff not selling fast, etc.


[26-Apr-24 07:17 PM] tuffyless#0000
Actually, that may answer my own question.
Thinking that if your final products are covered in surplus then guess it's not that far an assumption to figure the lower tier materials are covered too.


[26-Apr-24 07:22 PM] tuffyless#0000
Maybe will just think back to the original plan w/ these 4 permits:  of making fuel for all these ships that ya'll be selling.  haha 🤣


[26-Apr-24 07:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
heh could be


[26-Apr-24 07:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
tough to know at this point, normally I'd say metals get used up fast - in plates and cargo bays / fuel bays.. but maybe there's already enough excess


[26-Apr-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay posted some orders for ship components, starting here: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1156955200867811450/1233580960092655646


[26-Apr-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
once I have the goods, I will advertise the sale publically. The idea being you can have a ship in an hour


[27-Apr-24 05:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Weirdly there are a few people buying RCTs for 1m on ANT. In case anyone has some laying around and wants to jump on that

{Reactions}

[27-Apr-24 05:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
not sure why they aren't buying the QCRs 🤷‍♂️


[27-Apr-24 08:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
They're faster


[27-Apr-24 08:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
On distances greater than 2.4ps an RCT will perform the whole jump faster at 100% fuel than QCR


[27-Apr-24 08:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ohhh huh


[27-Apr-24 09:47 PM] exeler#0000
Wait, is that why my trips to etherewind take forever and adding more ftl fuel doesn't seem to help?


[27-Apr-24 11:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sent out orders for everything that people have supplied in #orders . Looks like 5 FSE and 8 QCR that haven't been bid for yet


[27-Apr-24 11:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can pick up 1x at 700k and 4x at 750k, which is pretty close to the price I marked.. but I'll give some time for everyone to chime in


[28-Apr-24 03:00 AM] melon164#0000
I can do all the QCR that no one else can handle, just got to bring them back from the other exchanges


[28-Apr-24 06:26 AM] allocater#0000
if RAG is a problem, I have 10 of those


[28-Apr-24 11:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have the parts to make a couple FSEs, it's just a matter of SPF taking awhile. I can have them by Friday I think


[28-Apr-24 11:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
max power on the QCR is about 20% less than max power on the RCT, so at max power it should be around 20% faster. The reason for the 2.4ps requirement is because of the wind up time, QCRs wind up a lot faster


[28-Apr-24 11:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
and if you don't put power above 80% on the RCT, then their speeds will be roughly equivalent from that point on a fuel-to-fuel basis (100% of QCR spends the same amount of fuel as 80% on an RCT, and thus travels at the same speed - sans the wind up time which is a constant and much faster with the QCR)

Does a 2k/2k ship fit in a 1500m3 warehouse? Or should I upgrade Heph more?


[30-Apr-24 08:53 PM] tuffyless#0000
No

ahh nice thanks

I guess you can accept them one at a time but it would be convenient to just have them all

Well that answers the “how fast will they sell” question 😀


[02-May-24 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup


[02-May-24 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
lord it's a lot of clicking though


[02-May-24 03:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
but I fixed the 3 contracts that had mistakes in them 😮‍💨


[02-May-24 03:54 PM] churavis#0000
Looks like we didn't charge enough


[02-May-24 03:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the bulk purchase is unsurprising. It's common to have 10s of millions, but not enough energy to spend it unless someone is making it easy


[02-May-24 03:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will bump up the price a bit on the next 5


[02-May-24 03:58 PM] churavis#0000
You sold all 5 to the same person?


[02-May-24 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
First one went to `VIVI` , other 4 went to Knarfaction


[02-May-24 04:01 PM] churavis#0000
Maybe he's just trying to catch up to bojidar?


[02-May-24 04:01 PM] churavis#0000
Those 4 will put him in 3rd place for most ships


[02-May-24 04:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
He said he's gonna share them with his corp


[02-May-24 04:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think he's bringing ships to pick them up and haul them away 😬

[02-May-24 04:11 PM] churavis#0000
Oof, how much inventory are those taking up?


[02-May-24 04:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
well I have a good system now for sending them to people. so I think we can do the next round. I think I just need 5 more FSE for the next 5 ships.


[02-May-24 04:12 PM] churavis#0000
Do we need more engine makers?


[02-May-24 04:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's about 2k per ship, so those BLKs are like 6000t (he picked up one ship to his warehouse)


[02-May-24 04:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's a good question for @melon164  (and maybe @hernanduer )


[02-May-24 04:12 PM] churavis#0000
Maybe he's making the one ship and then using that to ship the parts for the others

{Reactions}
🫠 

[02-May-24 04:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
there are a ton of FSE on ANT for 750k, which is the amount I sell them for.. So we could complete ships at 0 net cost.


[02-May-24 04:42 PM] melon164#0000
I have a stupid amount of CHA from processing a bulk lot of BOS I picked up a while ago, but FSE steal time and parts from my QCR line which does weird things like unbalance RCS/ACS.  I'd be happy to focus on the FTL engines if Hernanduer wants to do the STLs

[02-May-24 05:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
sounds good


[02-May-24 05:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make all the FSE stuff


[02-May-24 05:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
only issue is NOZ, andddd I dropped the SCI/ENG split housing from Heph because my SPF was idle too much 😄


[02-May-24 05:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
so it's running on only ENG - still 20 hours for 1 FSE (though the NOZ add another 60 hours 😦 )


[02-May-24 05:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
so roughly one FSE every 3 days


[02-May-24 05:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
if I added back the SCI (which requires blowing up _something_) I'd get another 45% efficiency back, from 115 to 160, so maybe like 2-2.5 days at that point


[02-May-24 05:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
this is also an option (I'll have 1 FSE ready each day for the next 3 days however)

👍 

[02-May-24 06:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds good. I will probably buy a few on the CX to fill in.


[02-May-24 06:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
So keep them coming’


[03-May-24 09:06 AM] allocater#0000
how would we advertise that we have new stock? writing a new comment in the thread might not be seen.

[04-May-24 02:13 AM] allocater#0000
the profit margins of connectors (BCO BCG HCC) are insane, in case anybody wants to get into it


[04-May-24 09:38 AM] tuffyless#0000
I know 🙂  FS's are so slow though.

[04-May-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
I might take a look at it - I've been wanting to branch out from food and food related chemicals. Torn between something like this or a construction base for bfabs and INS on Nike


[04-May-24 10:30 AM] tuffyless#0000
I'd suggest construction!  IMO, fabs are the ultimate currency in this game, esp when HQ upgrades start eating up 100's of Afabs.


[04-May-24 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah afab construction is the real end game


[04-May-24 12:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 1.5 planets making connectors… but I use them all up myself 😱


[06-May-24 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
They announced some changes to hull plates and shields


[06-May-24 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Other hull plates will get lighter and might get good. Shield reduce your need for hull plates now too


[06-May-24 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
```Namely, we will reduce the weight of higher-level hull plates, so they will mainly differ in production cost (and of course their resistance). Basic and lightweight plates will be adjusted as well, but this should make the more expensive ones more viable in comparison. Shield recipes will become less expensive overall as well. On top of that, applying shields to your ship will reduce the amount of hull plate materials you have to provide. The more and higher-tier shields your ship blueprint has, the more hull plates will be deducted from your repair bill, so shields will not just reduce the rate of deterioration but also save on other required repair materials. This should make using (especially higher-tier) shields more of an actually viable choice.```


[06-May-24 10:45 AM] churavis#0000
Someone is going to need to build an SPP, we'll also want to increase our textiles capacity


[06-May-24 10:45 AM] churavis#0000

[06-May-24 11:40 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have a TNP, SPP and already have 1 WPL very slowly creating textiles for BGS/AGS


[06-May-24 11:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
sounds like we'll want some HWPs too, I know a few guys have those


[06-May-24 11:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
I had one but there was too much LHP in the universe 😄


[06-May-24 11:56 AM] katinga#0000
Scotty, I need more power to shields


[06-May-24 12:26 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 462 TCS, so I can switch to pure TC for a long time


[06-May-24 02:14 PM] exeler#0000

that 100% shouldn't be happening and should be a priority to fix

[07-May-24 09:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
and he goes from 0 to 100 immediately

Whats the plan for the planet then?


[07-May-24 09:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
just filled a bit more POPI and running an AE program


[07-May-24 09:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
should resolve itself fine in the next cycle


[07-May-24 12:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
So is the situation just that you were working on reducing the other levels of POP, therefore also reducing unemployed engineers, and someone put down some more PP4 (I.e less unemployed engineers so some folks lost some)?


[07-May-24 12:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just curious, I don’t have my head around all the gov stuff yet 😄


[07-May-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes, that's pretty much it


[07-May-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
I knew it would be close here


[07-May-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
just didn't think people would throw a huge fit over 2% open jobs


[07-May-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
I already charged up the POPI starting last week


[07-May-24 12:51 PM] churavis#0000
If you want to reduce the lower tier population while maintaining the higher ones then you want to keep upkeep levels pretty much the same across categories while running immigration or education programs


[07-May-24 12:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
it seemed to be working okay, we held pops just fine with 20% cult/edu but yeah definitely will try to approach it a little better coming next


[07-May-24 12:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
2 weeks ago ENG was at 8% unemployment

@sidepipe


[07-May-24 12:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yup, makes sense - thanks for the explanation 🙂 I’ve only dealt with PIO and SET, so I’ve been insulated from this kind of stuff so far


[07-May-24 12:55 PM] sidepipe#0000

[07-May-24 01:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
my biggest problem right now is doing something I was already going to do, but now it looks like it's because he told me to 😢


[07-May-24 01:11 PM] churavis#0000
When did you decide to run a program and increase upkeep?


[07-May-24 01:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
I already did upkeep last week, and modified some lines to get partial coverage on the arts gallery with UTS/HOG 50/50 the time


[07-May-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
the program I ran after being asked by a guy who actually lost something


[07-May-24 01:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
which was well before Stinky's indignation

He likes to complain about other people like a 1 month 50 engineer shortage is the end of the world. And it's only new buildings that won't have them


[07-May-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000

oh yeah that's what I meant


[07-May-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah and ZV-307a has been short like 7 weeks. (ignoring the scientist shortage)


[07-May-24 02:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
which I'm generally fine with... but it does mean he shouldn't be complaining


[07-May-24 02:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
not even that really, just look at Heph itself. The engineer margin there for the last couple weeks is worse than Nike was last week


[07-May-24 02:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
one more SPF, OMG THE END OF THE WORLD


[07-May-24 02:28 PM] churavis#0000
Once the Shield update is enacted, we're going to see way more than just one more SPF

exactly


[07-May-24 02:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
seriously though, next time he misses CoGC, which I think was already twice this year

annnnd negative spread on the FX, weird


[07-May-24 07:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, if anyone wants to put more money into the FX at very agressive values, I've had people changing 10-20m on the FX


[07-May-24 07:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
apparently at 0.9 to 0.92 so... easy money to be made

Anecdotally, has anyone felt the effects of the expanding money supply over the last 14 months? I don’t have the long-term perspective here 😄


[15-May-24 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
oh yeah, all prices have changed, crops used to be 100, now 200


[15-May-24 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
PE was famously 4


[15-May-24 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
now 8

[15-May-24 11:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
I wonder if I could pull historical prices for a bunch of common materials to make an inflation index 🤔


[15-May-24 11:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
It puts some bfabs in a weird place where the MM ends up being the cheapest


[15-May-24 11:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
It didn't use to be that way

@allocater how much of that inflation is the bank responsible for, in your estimate? 🙂

{Reactions}

[16-May-24 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
last month was a growth of 460m AIC and 1b of all currencies


[16-May-24 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
I see now the bank is doing other currencies too


[16-May-24 11:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
Not enough 😄


[16-May-24 11:06 AM] allocater#0000
we produce only 150m per month


[16-May-24 11:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
2.25->5.5, 1.5->4.25, 1.5->3.5, 1->3... 10bil in new currency... Figure 60mil 14 months ago to 150mil now on linear slope, around 1.5bil, so 15% of all inflation 😲😄


[16-May-24 11:37 AM] churavis#0000
It only increases inflation if you use it to buy something. Money that is thrown into the ARC money pire or that sits in your account won't affect inflation.


[16-May-24 11:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
Ah yeah, I'm equating increase in money supply to inflation, but you're right it wouldn't necessarily impact usable money


[16-May-24 11:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
That settles it. We need to hoard more currency to counter inflation. Lowering the velocity of money is the only option 😄


[16-May-24 12:49 PM] exeler#0000
Hold the tendies so they're worth more. Got it


[16-May-24 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think the velocity naturally lowers itself, partly out of the natural human laziness, but also just out of the lack of things to do with it


[16-May-24 01:10 PM] archielvahr#0000

How does one accurately price goods internally? IE GRN->C->AL


[03-Jun-24 01:53 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I set material price in PRUNplanner to be equal to Cost Of Goods Manufactured, then repeat for the whole chain of production

[03-Jun-24 02:07 AM] allocater#0000
one way to do it would be to plan out bases for each and then set it so that the base income is equal for all bases

I have a spreadsheet that determines cost of materials, similar to prunplanner but older than the site

Ideally price per area per day would be involved. I have some such sheets but 🤷‍♂️


[04-Jun-24 06:45 PM] tuffyless#0000
Sanity check plz regarding the CoGM in PRUNplanner ...

If I set all the CoG's Empire-Wide that I produce, as the BUY price, to match my own cost of production 
(*which includes running through all the reiterations as many times as needed, since lowering consumables for example, lowers the CoGM of other products*), 
actually result in a true actual cost of production?  

Minus taxes & transportation of course.


[04-Jun-24 06:49 PM] tuffyless#0000
--
Sorry if that's just a string of text making no sense, it's kinda tough to ask the question.

I did that above before and the resulting CoGM which I produce just seemed to be super low.  
Example RAT was for like 10 or 15 AIC something to produce.

It just didnt seem right so I clicked the delete all button and havent retried it again.  
Takes alot time to reiterate through all the chains to get to the bottom line.


[04-Jun-24 06:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
That seems like it could be about right


[04-Jun-24 06:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve been meaning to do something similar - I make my own RAT, which I grow the plants for, which I extract the water for, which I make the bfabs for


[04-Jun-24 07:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
So assuming you are able to make all you consume, the cogm should be pretty low


[04-Jun-24 07:02 PM] tuffyless#0000
Exactly!  Same here.

I make nearly 100% of my own inputs from, bottom to top, for the final products which I produce.

And when reiterating through all those chains over and over resetting the updated BUY price accordingly, the ending CoGM is pretty damn low.


[04-Jun-24 07:04 PM] tuffyless#0000
So low in fact I couldnt believe it lol.  
thanks for the sanity Sidepipe.  🙂  
Will redo it all again when bored.


[04-Jun-24 07:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Upside - huge profit margins on the stuff you do sell! Downside - you eat up a ton of your own stuff and can't sell it 😄


[04-Jun-24 07:08 PM] tuffyless#0000
Agree!  
Maybe another sanity check I think it leads to an inflated Empire-Wide profit/loss margin.  

By that I mean, I think all the inputs you consume yourself, from all the various planets you produce them on, need to have SELL's matching your own BUY prices.

Otherwise, PRUNplanner thinks you're SELLing your own inputs at CX prices and BUYing your inputs from discounted genie.


[04-Jun-24 07:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that's why I have one CX preference set to Buy = Sell = AVG

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Jun-24 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I did make a sheet to calculate the same thing, and yes the prices can get extremely low. Extracted goods are something to think about. I made a sheet to extract them at like the 90th percentile efficiency- compared to what planets actually exist with those resources on them. 

A few notes. I think that if you are totally operating on "cost to produce", the prices get o low that taxes might be a non-trivial added cost. I ignored them but probably shouldn't. Maybe likewise for travel costs.


[04-Jun-24 07:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I think taxes and transport cost would actually be a  lower bound


[04-Jun-24 07:10 PM] tuffyless#0000
The taxes compound themselves though, which I thoughts about once to be important.

Ex: 
You're making MEA.
Taxes on the H2O.  on the Agri.  on the RAT.  on the FIM.  on the MEA.  etc

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Jun-24 07:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
there's nothing else that limits the cogm for something that's fully vertically integrated - the cogm will just get lower and lower every iteration, I think


[04-Jun-24 07:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
(i think. unlike others, I've never done the math in real life 😄 )


[04-Jun-24 07:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was getting prices like... ALO 18.8. RAT 19.2, DW 17.4, FIM 217.6


[04-Jun-24 07:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
huh, does it ever converge? That's an interesting question


[04-Jun-24 07:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
On my sheet, the iteration does stop when it changes by a very small amount between iterations


[04-Jun-24 07:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe I need to haul out R for this 😄


[04-Jun-24 07:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess that doesn’t strictly mean there’s a limit


[04-Jun-24 07:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it would asymptotically go to zero if you were making every product yourself


[04-Jun-24 07:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah google docs is unhappy with the iteration. I was considering doing more in Jupyter. There are some python tools out there.


[04-Jun-24 07:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Modeling taxes would stop that.


[04-Jun-24 07:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since every cost is just a linear combination of other costs. Otherwise it would just go to the sum of taxes on every good in the chain


[04-Jun-24 07:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since taxes aren’t a proportion of the value, but a fixed currency cost per production time


[04-Jun-24 07:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
Transport costs would technically also go to zero if you make your own fuel and ship parts 😄

much more manual and brutish


[04-Jun-24 07:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
So my first pass of the tool made me think AIRs were the best thing ever. Because the markup is actually really good. But they produce really slowly and they need large area buildings. So the number of AIRs you get per day per area is pretty low, even if the markup is good, they are a poor money maker


[04-Jun-24 07:26 PM] tuffyless#0000
Kinda reminds me of MHL's.  
Almost 9.5 days to make 20 but they max at 32xx AIC.

It seems too often the requirements conflict with other plans, or frequently cost rather than provide funds.

I still accept some types of new faction missions. My HQ is on Nike, the most common mission I get is taking packages from my HQ planet to ANT. I always have extra shipping capacity back from ANT since shipping inputs are so much heavier than outputs.

[07-Jun-24 09:17 AM] churavis#0000
Reputation gives you better missions which give you more reputation which gives you better missions.....


[07-Jun-24 09:17 AM] akyantor#0000
So perhaps worth keeping them to cherry pick ones that fit around whatever it is you're doing


[07-Jun-24 09:17 AM] akyantor#0000
And I suppose, if reputation is used for something later you'd have built up more score.


[07-Jun-24 09:18 AM] churavis#0000
Yes, if you don't like any of the three you get then just reject them as the timer for the next ones doesn't start until you either accept or reject all of the previous ones.

I also used to steal some faction contracts but I never got anything good out of them - mostly just ores and LST


[07-Jun-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I wonder if I could get them for HAL on Halcyon….


[07-Jun-24 03:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
they used to have really good ones at the very beginning, I remember one being like 100 IDC or something

I wish the game would let you 'defect'


[07-Jun-24 10:10 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I mostly just take the contracts that want to take a shipment to somewhere I already have a route anyway, like Nike to ANT


[07-Jun-24 10:47 PM] churavis#0000
That's most the contracts I get, is your HQ on Nike?


[07-Jun-24 11:01 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah


[07-Jun-24 11:02 PM] churavis#0000
Weird


[09-Jun-24 07:08 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm planning on dropping H2O production on harmonia and just shipping it in from ANT (until I get a supply from a dedicated planet). It increases profitability by 10k, which doesn't seem much, but I figure it'll improve as it accelerates the generation of agri experts (as I'm replacing the RIGs with more FRMs). 

Do most folks have their own H2O supply on a dedicated planet (like Ice Station Alpha), or just buy it as it's so liquid on the market? *Excuse the pun.*


[09-Jun-24 07:10 AM] katinga#0000
i would have bought H2O from you on Harm.  I have a HYF base on Life, in the same system, and those things are thirsty


[09-Jun-24 07:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I suspect everyone suffers from the same problem... I'm a bit tight on supplying GRN to my C farm on 759g, production only just matching supply, so favouring more FRM over the local H2O supply.


[09-Jun-24 07:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm only just getting enough H2O at the moment to keep the FRM going, and the small excess has been going to Griffonstone for CL/EPO production


[09-Jun-24 07:12 AM] akyantor#0000
It will mean that I'll have something to put on the ships going from ANT->Harm, as they're almost always empty for me at the moment.


[09-Jun-24 07:12 AM] katinga#0000
I grow GRN on Demeter to burn and have a few pumps there.  I don't find it cost effective to ship water from ANT all the way out there


[09-Jun-24 07:13 AM] akyantor#0000
That makes sense. A lot further out than I've gone so far.


[09-Jun-24 07:15 AM] akyantor#0000
I see there's an adjacent planet to that one with lots of water, but looks expensive to build on. Low gravity, high temp, and low pressure. *Yikes*


[09-Jun-24 07:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I only extract water on Ice Station Alpha, but there is also Etherwind, if I need more


[09-Jun-24 07:17 AM] katinga#0000
Etherwind is as far as Demeter, just in another direction


[09-Jun-24 07:19 AM] katinga#0000
A few folks go out to Boucher, too


[09-Jun-24 07:21 AM] akyantor#0000
I think one of my future bases will eventually be to setup on Ice Station Alpha, but I think for now there are a few more profitable options in the short term. I'm thinking either PE/OVE/EXO/OFF) production on Hephaestus, or PG/MG production on 759d.


[09-Jun-24 07:21 AM] akyantor#0000
Not decided yet.


[09-Jun-24 07:26 AM] katinga#0000
how do you collect it when it's ice?  (that's not a mineral btw, folks)  I imagine lots of workers with ice picks and coleman coolers


[09-Jun-24 07:26 AM] akyantor#0000
Sounds like hard work to me.


[09-Jun-24 07:26 AM] akyantor#0000
Ice picks and hair driers. 😛


[09-Jun-24 07:28 AM] katinga#0000
bring your Charizard?


[09-Jun-24 07:39 AM] domicius#0000
I buy H2O - not worth extracting it unless you want to secure supply. It's a cheap commodity

{Reactions}

[09-Jun-24 07:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
I extract my own H2O, but only because I make a fair bit of DW and do a lot of farming (HYF on SE-110b, 3 permits on harmonia). In most cases, there’s more profitable things to use a permit on 🙂


[09-Jun-24 07:53 AM] churavis#0000
I import water into Demeter not just so I can max out my FRM but also because my ships are always going there empty anyways so it's essentially free shipping from ANT anyways


[09-Jun-24 07:56 AM] tuffyless#0000
Same here.  Got 3 planets producing H2O to keep 2 planets of HYF's running, 3 planets of FP & FER's, and 2 planets of FRM's.  Plus the ORC & IVP's.  
Maybe more profitable things for the 3 H2O permits but am guaranteed no supply/CX pricing issues.


[09-Jun-24 07:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Now _that’s_ a lot of farming 😄


[09-Jun-24 08:01 AM] tuffyless#0000
If someone uses HER, I think it's best to use Harmonia for FRM's instead of HYF


[09-Jun-24 08:02 AM] katinga#0000
since I only grow on Demeter to burn for C, which goes into my smelting ops, I don't mind giving up a little bit of land there to pump my own water


[09-Jun-24 08:07 AM] katinga#0000
I wish the game would up the available plots on planets.  I've been wanting to get on Deimos for months.  the plot limits don't make much sense to me on a whole planet


[09-Jun-24 08:48 AM] zipatsu#0000
What if they introduced plot auctions for ''full'' planets as a currency sink 🤔


[09-Jun-24 08:49 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, it'd be good if there was some kind of mechanism. Otherwise certain planets are just a lock out for new players.


[09-Jun-24 08:49 AM] akyantor#0000
But it should definitely go the other way... under populated planets should afford the option for players to take more than one plot, with some limitation so you can't just fully stack a single planet.


[09-Jun-24 08:50 AM] katinga#0000
389 plots doesn't seem that many.  It's like they restricted players to an area the size of Delaware.  Like wtf?


[09-Jun-24 08:50 AM] zipatsu#0000
That edit killed my dream of putting my entire H2O operation on a single planet 😄

{Reactions}
🤣 

[09-Jun-24 08:51 AM] akyantor#0000
An escalating cost for each new plot taken... so there some kind of trade off.

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Jun-24 08:52 AM] zipatsu#0000
Yeah, 3xx definitely isn't a lot and then the popi buildings also take up slots for some reason


[09-Jun-24 09:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have ISA and Etherwind. ISA costs more to build on, but does have a better income per day, even including the repair costs. Like others have said, since Harmonia is fertile you'll probably eventually want to do all FRMs there.


[09-Jun-24 09:45 AM] akyantor#0000
I've decided to go that route now before I expand to another planet. I've the materials in ANT to do it, just need to buy the water and wait for a ship to take the H2O and construction materials to Harmonia.


[09-Jun-24 09:47 AM] akyantor#0000
It's a relatively small change materials wise, so feels like a no brainer. I'll then do a big resupply to get my 3 current planets up to 20 days endurance, and then pick and settle the 4th base. 🙂

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Jun-24 09:48 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm leaning towards the Hephaestus route, as it'll only take 500k to get the initial plan up and running. I shouldn't have an issue doing that by next weekend, by selling the EPO/C/NR that I'm already making.


[09-Jun-24 09:50 AM] katinga#0000
I think the plot limited could be increased with Infrastructure projects completed.  that would 'suggest' that further development needs additional infrastructure to support it.  remember playing SimCity and you needed more hospitals, power plants, and police stations?


[09-Jun-24 09:53 AM] katinga#0000
"You must construct additional pylons"


[09-Jun-24 09:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
Or just limit everyone to max 3 permits per planet with no limit on total plots


[09-Jun-24 09:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
as much as I feel ambivalent about the plot system, I kinda like how it forces people to look outward to new planets


[09-Jun-24 09:57 AM] akyantor#0000
That's true. There'd be less reason to expand outwards if you can stack the same planets


[09-Jun-24 09:57 AM] katinga#0000
depends on what they are looking for in a planet.  Resources?  Oh it's a good place to make a chip factory here?  that will still make people look at different planets


[09-Jun-24 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the catch with the plot system is that the plot limits are actually pretty high. So there's only a handful of planets affected. The goal is to encourage people to expand, but when it happens sort of infrequently people don't see it as a "regular common mechanic"


[09-Jun-24 10:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that's a good point. Sometimes I feel like this game was designed for about 4-10x the players it has atm


[09-Jun-24 10:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
(not that I could design it any better 😄 )


[09-Jun-24 10:02 AM] zipatsu#0000
Sounds interesting for sure! Would also be awesome to, way down the line, have large scale ways to further improve planets somehow so that there's not just one best planet for X


[09-Jun-24 10:03 AM] katinga#0000
I feel that, too.  all that white space on the map.  maybe if a player had the resource to establish their own stations the way you could in Eve, some of those really remote systems would be better settled


[09-Jun-24 10:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also I guess there are a lot of conundrums around planet design. A lot of planets are just bad 🤷‍♂️  And the ones that were tweaked to be good are all very near CXes


[09-Jun-24 10:04 AM] katinga#0000
there are a lot of 'Tatooine' systems on the map


[09-Jun-24 10:06 AM] sidepipe#0000

[09-Jun-24 10:42 AM] katinga#0000
But then again, what does OS-099 got that BS-987 aint got?


[09-Jun-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000

Hmm, not sure then :S


[13-Jun-24 04:21 PM] akyantor#0000
@churavis & @archielvahr I’ve noticed that you both always bid for all of the NR I auction. Would you have a use for more supply if I double production? Np if not, just keen to find niches to fill in corp priced goods.


[13-Jun-24 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep I'd say I could use any conceivable amount of EPO or NR


[13-Jun-24 04:29 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, good to know. Thanks


[13-Jun-24 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I have space for a second lab on griffonstone that I was planning to use to expand NR production. Just been prioritising increasing C production on 759g in the last week.

A quick somewhat stupid question. If you place a production order for more than one run of goods. Does it produce all the goods at the end of the order, or make them incrementally available throughout the run? For example, if I specify a farm order with an order size of 5 GRN, do I get 4 GRN emitted periodically, or 20 GRN at the end of the entire order.

It takes the inputs from your inventory at the beginning and then puts the outputs into your inventory all at once at the end

[17-Jun-24 09:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you cancel it mid order though, you get the % of time completed in products, and get back the inverse % of inputs

floored though, so it's a loss


[17-Jun-24 10:03 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I think I saw that before with order size 1.


[22-Jun-24 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
I feel like I flick back and forth about what direction to go in terms of a goal. I've production of EPO, NR, PE, and have a plan to get PG going on 759d. After that... I was thinking of going towards making construction fabs, but feels like there's pretty good coverage of making those already... is it viable to try to make some kind of ship parts instead (doesn't look like the market is all that liquid for individual parts)?


[22-Jun-24 04:32 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm minded to stick with fabs, if only because I already have a lot of the required production lines to progress to at least rfabs (if I throw in an ALO/AL base on Nascent).


[22-Jun-24 04:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
That seems like a logical next step 🙂


[22-Jun-24 04:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
The higher level fabs aren't as liquid, but it definitely seems like they sell well. And I imagine there's lots of players getting to the point in HQ upgrades where they'll need l and rfabs


[22-Jun-24 04:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
And since you don't have a base on Nike yet - the corp bonus there does make a pretty big difference


[22-Jun-24 04:38 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'll get a base there eventually... probably will do the PG base next, then Nascent, then Nike (at which point I'll have all the required materials to do alsorts of different fabs)


[22-Jun-24 04:39 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm doing BDE in a minor way on Heph already... but that's mostly going to get consumed by my own usage.


[22-Jun-24 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe afabs seem far away at your stages, but they are solid profit, and I really think demand is endless. Lots of players sitting on 10-100m just waiting to do their next HQ upgrade


[22-Jun-24 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
And if you're only making EPO, well that's okay, that sells great. Same with NR.


[22-Jun-24 04:42 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, nearly all the intermediary materials are good for selling the excess (e.g. EPO, PG, PE, AL etc.)


[22-Jun-24 04:44 PM] akyantor#0000
If I go down the fab route, I pretty much know what I'm doing for my next 4 bases (759d for PG, WU-070a for GL products, Nascent for ALO, then Nike to start fab production)


[22-Jun-24 04:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ship parts are still mostly sold privately. So they sell more than it appears on the CX. Take a look at something like FSE on the CX. The 7d units sold is 3 for the whole universe. But in that time the weekly universe production is 34. They aren't sitting unsold on the CX

I've already upgraded my HQ for one of those bases. I've the materials for the second in storage... so really it's just time to make money, and incrementally build each of those bases.


[22-Jun-24 04:48 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm probably going to do the PG base first, as it's the least painful from a shipping perspective.


[22-Jun-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah my Electronica seems like it only needs one visit every 2 weeks


[22-Jun-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's all PG


[22-Jun-24 04:49 PM] akyantor#0000
The Nascent ALO/AL base really will need to wait until I've the WCB upgrade on at least one of my starter ships, and then it'd be more managable.


[24-Jun-24 06:42 AM] akyantor#0000
I've started buying the materials for my 759d base... will probably post some orders after I've auctioned my next batch of EPO, NR, PE. 🙂


[25-Jun-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Free business idea... someone should start a:

Municipal Management Business:
The MMB supplies the COGC, SST, and INF on  your planet in exchange for direct payments from the government. It would set a very healthy rate for those basic materials, DW, MCG, PE, RAT, OFF, and TUB... Promise weekly deliveries. Then offer a 10% kickback to the governor / parliament member who contracted them. 

Because the parliament isn't spending their own money, they would be happy to pay an exhorbitant delivery fee to avoid messing with the recurring deliveries. The payments to the supplier are public, but the kickback would be hidden from public view. So everyone wins.

@archielvahr If you're willing then I'd propose this [setup for WU-070a](https://prunplanner.org/shared/a9f04924-5670-4c1d-bd46-a89ef9af926f). I've around 156,508 in AIC at the mo, so would probably need a float of around 600k for the materials. That'll give me a purpose for my NA finally. 😛


[25-Jun-24 04:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
let's doooooo it!


[25-Jun-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
You want a 2k/2k ship too? I'll throw one in


[25-Jun-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
It'll take 24hr to build though


[25-Jun-24 04:27 PM] akyantor#0000
Sure, but that's quite a large uplift from a 600k arragement. 😛


[25-Jun-24 04:28 PM] akyantor#0000

`DO NOT RESPOND IN THIS CHANNEL UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED TO, OR I WILL DELETE IT AND WAG MY FINGER AT YOU IN A FORCEFUL MANNER

Hello all. Apologies for the ping, but I feel this is important. The new changes from the patch today have changed governance, and I want to start off on a strong foot that has us organized.

To preface: I plan on running for parliament on all planets I currently oversee, and likely a few larger ones as well, to assist where I can. 

How this is relevant to you:
-I think it is important that anyone have an opportunity for all who wish to contribute and try their hand at assisting, or just learning how running planets is done. Spoiler: Its a tedious and not very glorious job that requires weekly effort.
-Thus, I would ask that anyone who is interested in specifically helping run, through daily/week extra button clicks, to run planets, please respond to this post with the planets you wish to serve on, in the order of preference, from most desirable to least. See below for an example, and note which planets you would like to be Speaker on.

Rise:
Hephaestus (Speaker)
Astraeus (Speaker)
Eos
...
Digging's mother (Speaker 😍 )
A2D

My goal in creating such a list for everyone is to prioritize what people want to do, create a reasonable distribution for those who want to help, and to avoid any conflict or hurt feelings. Specifically, I also do not mind if someone wants the "top spot" on most planets. My interest is only in maintaining good governance and policy. If you desire this on a planet, I ask the following (ask, not require) `


[26-Jun-24 10:15 AM] .urpalhal#0000
`Help me to continue to let me provide upkeep and continue to receive payouts as I have been, at least in the short term for the first month. After the first multi-person Parliament is elected, we will reassess.

Down the line, take heed on my instructions for inputs and population strategy and source the upkeep from me exclusively, unless a cheaper source than what I offer becomes available.

Help me maintain tax rates as they are currently, or in line with the average across the planets I've run, at least for the first month pending review once we see what individual planet finances are.

Help me maintain an overall goal to continue the population levels/support/happiness as they are now.

Minimal drama. Just good work. We are here to help people and create the most well run planets in the game.


Let me know your thoughts, as these are the products of 5:30am brain.

I could produce some TAI on WU-070a, which I don't have an immediate need for myself. If I put it up on auctions occasionally in ANT, will anyone have any interest in buying it?


[27-Jun-24 03:32 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
TAI is expensive to process, takes a long time, and it's only real use is for making SC (which is critical but has a small demand). I would buy some if you produce but not a lot.


[27-Jun-24 03:39 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Question (apologies if it's already been discussed):
Now that income from planets is going into the planet's wallet instead of the corp wallet, I take it the Dividend is over?


[27-Jun-24 03:42 AM] akyantor#0000
I think it's expected there will be one further meaningful payout (covering the funds accumulated between Monday and Wednesday), but after that it'll diminish substantially.


[27-Jun-24 03:43 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably produce ~9 units a day, don't know if that's a lot or not. May be simpler to stick with an oversupply of SIO that I can sell more reliably if there's not a lot of demand.


[27-Jun-24 03:50 AM] melon164#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:09 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I almost exclusively sell both fuels internally, and for 9/u because besides HE3 I produce all resources myself. If the demand is that high, we could maybe need some more fuel produced in corp. I wouldn't mind another fuel producing planet, maybe I place a second refinery base.

Been buying SF/FF off CX for insane prices. 😠


[27-Jun-24 12:10 PM] katinga#0000
the project is going to need some OOG members in the system too.  on C and G


[27-Jun-24 12:11 PM] neth_havoc#0000
If you need chap GAL let me know, I have more then enough.


[27-Jun-24 12:11 PM] katinga#0000
we could yank A from Rise... but that's a later thing.  we should focus on the other 2


[27-Jun-24 12:40 PM] katinga#0000
Is there a chance some of y'all big shots can sponsor bases with newer players out there?


[27-Jun-24 12:41 PM] katinga#0000
@archielvahr can we get a channel for that system?  we can take the development project there


[27-Jun-24 12:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
#base-sponsoring if you have wants


[27-Jun-24 12:42 PM] katinga#0000
not my base.  i can manage.  i mean newer folks


[27-Jun-24 12:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh oh, hmmm I'd really only prefer in corp


[27-Jun-24 12:43 PM] katinga#0000
newer folks in this corp!

[27-Jun-24 12:59 PM] katinga#0000
I need some PSL for the base hubs


[27-Jun-24 12:59 PM] katinga#0000
the core modules


[27-Jun-24 01:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got a channel for #⛽romulan-system  related projects


[27-Jun-24 01:06 PM] churavis#0000
Is there a limit to the number of channels we can have?


[27-Jun-24 01:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the planet channels might be getting more use with the politics update now.. I know there's a lot, but I think it's helpful to sort them out


[27-Jun-24 01:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
effectively no


[27-Jun-24 01:07 PM] katinga#0000
You rock!


[27-Jun-24 03:35 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm super close to the next base

I can supply FF. Just put up an auction today.


[28-Jun-24 04:03 PM] katinga#0000
anything you want to donate, I'll be grateful for


[28-Jun-24 06:52 PM] tuffyless#0000
thanks Paris, Im in.


[28-Jun-24 06:53 PM] tuffyless#0000
Also sent @_bojidar a contd for some SF; still waiting for him to accept it.  
He gets alot cheap stuff from my auctions so would be nice for participation the other way around.  🤷‍♂️


[29-Jun-24 02:00 AM] _bojidar#0000
you have contr for what you want. go get it


[29-Jun-24 02:02 AM] tuffyless#0000
Katoa?  I see how ya work; gotta spend a tank to get a tank + alittle


[29-Jun-24 02:05 AM] _bojidar#0000
i dont have sf on Ant. i dont even sell fuel..or very rare as i use all i produce my self. but since you i\need it i.m ok for you to have it


[29-Jun-24 02:05 AM] tuffyless#0000
My bad - I thought you were a selling of Fuel.  Seemed as so too by the LEAD board


[29-Jun-24 02:08 AM] _bojidar#0000
it was probably a year ago..my bad i didnt change on that sheet


[29-Jun-24 02:13 AM] tuffyless#0000
ok yeh.  Still seems as though the auctions should be give-n-take.  But ok


[29-Jun-24 02:15 AM] tuffyless#0000
I'll be sure to filter you out accordingly in future


[29-Jun-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
A heads up that I am tearing down my Aratora base. I have alot of BTS in stock.. and Hern has a lot of Tungsten on the CX, so I think it'll be okay for a couple months

[29-Jun-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd be really surprised if someone started buying the stuff I was storing on the CX, it's priced pretty high


[29-Jun-24 12:34 PM] mrsmith33#0000
690 doesn't seem high


[29-Jun-24 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I swear it was like 300 a year ago 🤷‍♂️


[29-Jun-24 01:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
We'll see how shield demand comes in after we see what the changes are in staging server. I might need to sponsor someone to get out there if they're good enough!


[29-Jun-24 01:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ohhh they use a lot of W


[29-Jun-24 01:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah and I'll probably need another AML base, chem base #8 I think lol


[29-Jun-24 01:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
Or maybe just drop some PG/EPO production


[29-Jun-24 02:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I'm starting to come around to a hub and spoke model for logistics... too much of a headache to plan something cleverer even with 6 bases. 😛 Just have all the ships shuttle between each planet and ANT, with megastorage at ANT.

[29-Jun-24 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, it helps that ANT has up to 500k warehouse space. Hard to beat that


[29-Jun-24 02:25 PM] akyantor#0000
I've been running myself ragged trying to be smart about doing multiple hops... but think I'm just going to start being a bit "dummer" about it.


[29-Jun-24 02:26 PM] akyantor#0000
I realised today that often it was as quick to go from ZV-759g to ANT, as it was from ZV-759d... depending on the orbital position.


[30-Jun-24 11:40 PM] katinga#0000
@uncle_leslie69 the pop on Vulcan is taking a bit of a dip


[30-Jun-24 11:48 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Vulcan or 759g?


[30-Jun-24 11:49 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000

I’ll check when I get back, kinda needed to take a dip because unemployment just kept going up

I’ll fully stock it all up later then

Not really a need for em.  people are just sucking hydrogen.


[30-Jun-24 11:54 PM] katinga#0000
it's a PIO world


[30-Jun-24 11:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
33% unemployment is plenty of workers though. There's 4000 unemployed pioneers


[30-Jun-24 11:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is that just a newly expanded base? The rest will fill in when the POPI rolls over in 1d 1hr


[30-Jun-24 11:56 PM] katinga#0000
no.  it's a standard 500 base.  expanded is 750


[30-Jun-24 11:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean, did you just build more buildings?


[30-Jun-24 11:56 PM] katinga#0000
?


[30-Jun-24 11:56 PM] katinga#0000
dorms and collectors


[30-Jun-24 11:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
So when you make a new building, you don't get your full workforce immediately. You get workers out of the workforce pool (the number in parenthesis), then you get the rest of the workers distributed during the POPI report


[01-Jul-24 12:00 AM] katinga#0000
I built 5 days ago


[01-Jul-24 12:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, so that was after this report started, 5d 23hr ago. So when it rolls over in 1d, 1hr, you'll get all your workers


[01-Jul-24 12:06 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Ahh fair, I’m not too clued up on all this stuff just yet


[01-Jul-24 12:06 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Lol


[01-Jul-24 09:54 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I want to build PP3 base on Aceland, but there is a tech deficit


[01-Jul-24 10:00 AM] mrsmith33#0000
there is actually a tech immigration program running


[01-Jul-24 11:23 AM] melon164#0000
Build it on KI-401a instead 😁


[01-Jul-24 11:31 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Looks promising


[01-Jul-24 11:35 AM] mrsmith33#0000
A bit far though


[02-Jul-24 04:12 PM] akyantor#0000
I've been sleeping on STO... was using warehouses quite a bit, but so much easier to have a STO. 😛


[02-Jul-24 04:13 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm slowly building them where there's space on my existing bases to make it less of a faff to manage.


[03-Jul-24 12:53 PM] zipatsu#0000
I sacrifice the extra rig(s) on my H2O bases just so I can add in 2 STO's, great for stocking up a few months at a time / not being pressured into constant deadlines before you run out of space 😄

[03-Jul-24 01:40 PM] katinga#0000
Question: what does the Reserve do in the Upkeep UI for infrastructure buildings?  Does that stockpile for the next upkeep cycle(s)


[03-Jul-24 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep


[03-Jul-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
The "Next consumption" is the next 3 or 5 or 10 days or whatever, then the reserve rolls into it. The reserve can usually hold like 30 days of stuff.


[03-Jul-24 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
The actual amount of needs generated is the average fullness of the Next Consumption bar during the week


[03-Jul-24 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
(or maybe more precisely, the fullness of the next consumption bar at the end of each consumption cycle, summed up for the week)... hard to be exactly sure.


[03-Jul-24 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
In practice, people either keep the bar full or empty for a cycle.


[03-Jul-24 01:43 PM] katinga#0000
that's cool though that you can take care of upkeep for a while


[03-Jul-24 01:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Athough supplying half a bar of something could have value to fine tune.. it's just too hard to fine tune that way


[03-Jul-24 01:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
also the little teeny tiny movement bars make that impossible


[03-Jul-24 01:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
really should have a number entry box as well


[03-Jul-24 02:03 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Created a base on Aceland


[04-Jul-24 02:38 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I really need more PE production, but permits are so expensive, that it may be a bad idea


[04-Jul-24 02:39 PM] mrsmith33#0000

[06-Jul-24 12:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Next revelation... using FIO to pull in current stock levels to my google sheets rather than manually updating them to check upkeep status and calculate restock needs... also a game changer. 😛


[06-Jul-24 12:10 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, would be a headache to manage 6 planets, let alone the other ones that I have planned.


[06-Jul-24 12:10 PM] akyantor#0000
I've scheduled it to automatically update every 4 hours automatically now, rather than me manually updating it occasionally ...


[06-Jul-24 12:12 PM] akyantor#0000
The only sad thing is the balance API isn't working any more.


[06-Jul-24 12:12 PM] tuffyless#0000
definitely true!  I did the same.  
And also sucked in the workforce data so could bump the two datasets up against each other, to keep an excess stock on each planet.


[06-Jul-24 12:13 PM] tuffyless#0000
and then the same for inputs using the burn datsset


[06-Jul-24 12:13 PM] akyantor#0000
I've not pulled the workforce data yet, but that's the next logical step. I've manually keyed that at the moment. I didn't go there yet, as doesn't change anywhere near as frequently.


[06-Jul-24 12:16 PM] tuffyless#0000
found that doing the same for Fab repairs is helpful too. 
So when time comes to repair, all the correct # of mats are already onsite.


[06-Jul-24 12:16 PM] akyantor#0000
I've not really looked at repairs... scared to look


[06-Jul-24 12:17 PM] tuffyless#0000
haha.  you'll wish you did one day 🙂


[06-Jul-24 12:17 PM] akyantor#0000
What threshold should you repair?


[06-Jul-24 12:17 PM] akyantor#0000
I've only been going for 77 days... so hopefully not hit the threshold where it's necessary yet


[06-Jul-24 12:18 PM] tuffyless#0000
I've always wanted to publish the dashboard sheet I created for others to use but havent really figure out how to easily allow others to quickly convert to their API key


[06-Jul-24 12:19 PM] tuffyless#0000
For Borg-like-efficiency, Repair times are different per building.  I never bothered to learn all the variations.  So I typically stick with the 90-day limit myself

The fab calcs are super helpful because when all the planets are summarized, you can project-out what you need the buildings to focus on making.

[06-Jul-24 12:25 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, definitely going to need something like that at some point.


[09-Jul-24 03:32 PM] akyantor#0000
Anyone still in the market for excess ALO?
I've a decision to make, either fully stack extraction on Nascent and have a separate smelter world (2x permit), or just stack enough extractor and smelters on Nascent for my initial needs. *If there's still more demand for ALO in corp, then I'd lean towards the former option.*


[09-Jul-24 03:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
I buy like 70 ALO/d on the CX, but I'm perfectly comfortable with that. Saving like 3500/d just to have a contract isn't worth it to me, so I'll keep doing that 😅

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Jul-24 03:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
really wanna see those corp CXs in the next update


[09-Jul-24 03:41 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, could be a case for me to just sell into the CX, even if there wasn't corp demand.


[09-Jul-24 03:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's worth running the numbers


[09-Jul-24 03:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
most of my bases are above resource extraction, so I buy most of my raw MATs on the CX


[09-Jul-24 03:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
gotta keep the economy going and all


[09-Jul-24 03:47 PM] katinga#0000
I mine my own ALO.  if there's demand for it, I'm willing to sell internally.  otherwise i've been mining and smelting along to sell on the CX


[09-Jul-24 05:49 PM] tuffyless#0000
In a month or so, Im planning to ditch my EXT's on Deimos which dig ALO.  So I'll no longer have a source for it.  
I'd rather buy ALO, either intra-corp or from CX, then to spend a permit at Nascent on EXT's.


[09-Jul-24 05:50 PM] tuffyless#0000
I'll be a buyer.  I think Churaviis may be a buyer of too.


[09-Jul-24 09:42 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Selling excess raw materials to the CX will almost always get you a profit, even if only a small one


[09-Jul-24 10:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah it's just a matter of determining if that permit could make you more money elsewhere


[09-Jul-24 10:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
And given the ease of entry into the resources market, it tends to covet lower margins


[10-Jul-24 07:09 AM] akyantor#0000
If you've a stockpile of TRU, today is the day to put it on the market. There are zero offers on the AI CX!


[10-Jul-24 09:00 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Reduced AUO extraction from 3 EXT to 1 on ZV-194d, and increased SME 9 -> 12
PP4 4->5 on Nike


[10-Jul-24 11:09 AM] katinga#0000
at what point should I actively be trying to recruit more players to establish players on the Romulan planets?  The pops are low, but immigration programs are in progress.


[10-Jul-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
The first few weeks you probably only have the pop to add one base per week. When I was at that point I was mentioning it to people individually, once you have like 3 bases worth of pop in there you can publically solicit


[10-Jul-24 11:30 AM] katinga#0000
I don't have anyone setting up shop on Remus or ROMc


[10-Jul-24 11:48 AM] katinga#0000
NGL, I was a little surprised that Romulus and Remus hadn't been taken as planet names in a faction region of space where the planet names have Roman influences.


[10-Jul-24 11:55 AM] katinga#0000
It's also a bit slow.  I think I sucked most of the pop increase into my current bases on those planets.  The next POPR should be able to sustain a new neighbor

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Jul-24 11:55 AM] akyantor#0000
Where do folks normally setup shop when they want a second constrution planet? Aceland?


[12-Jul-24 12:14 PM] mrsmith33#0000
ZV-194b, Aceland


[12-Jul-24 12:16 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm starting to think it's getting worth at least making my own DW... buying a months supply at this point is a almost half a million AIC. :S


[12-Jul-24 12:16 PM] akyantor#0000
Or are there enough folks with an oversupply in corp?


[12-Jul-24 12:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
how much do you use per day / week?


[12-Jul-24 12:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
~7000 per month? based off .5M for a month at about 75 AIC


[12-Jul-24 12:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
I make about 790/day, and it would be easy enough to make more. I have a ton of extra water that I'm not really using right now in favor of RATs


[12-Jul-24 12:30 PM] akyantor#0000
I've been trying to get a month of stock built up at the CX so I stop doing a bunch of smaller orders. I've worked out with my current set of bases I need about 7,500 RAT/DW.


[12-Jul-24 12:30 PM] akyantor#0000
It's more complicated to be self sufficient in RAT than it is DW.


[12-Jul-24 12:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that makes sense. I want to expand my DW production as well, but I'm kinda out of good FP planets in antares space


[12-Jul-24 12:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a decent surplus of DW, my RATs are a slight surplus depending on the day.


[12-Jul-24 12:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd rather make FIMs but I don't always have the HER


[12-Jul-24 12:32 PM] akyantor#0000
Or at least... keen not to do that in favour of getting to the end of my current plan to get bfab and lfab production up and running. Need to build three more bases (Nike, Nascent and Vulcan), as well as reconfigure 759d/Heph a bit.


[12-Jul-24 12:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can sell to ya. +1.2k RATs / day as well


[12-Jul-24 12:32 PM] akyantor#0000
Fair enough.


[12-Jul-24 12:33 PM] akyantor#0000
Maybe more of a problem when I have those other bases up.


[12-Jul-24 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was considering maybe dropping a base on somewhere like SE-751b


[12-Jul-24 12:33 PM] akyantor#0000
It feels like there's demand for more RAT at least.


[12-Jul-24 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. I've probably been selling too much RATs to ADI


[12-Jul-24 12:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've been considering putting in a limit of like 1k / week / person there, since there are several people that buy 2/3k at a time


[12-Jul-24 12:34 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm not sure anyone else is selling RAT/DW ADI, and it's grown quite a bit even since I joined.


[12-Jul-24 12:34 PM] akyantor#0000
I saw even KAWA were trying to get in on the action yesterday. 😛


[12-Jul-24 12:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
Food might not be the most profitable, but it _never_ goes out of style 😄


[12-Jul-24 12:35 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, solid demand


[12-Jul-24 12:35 PM] akyantor#0000
Even more so than the lower tier fabs...


[12-Jul-24 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
Does anyone know of good FP planets other than Norwick and Thalassa B?


[12-Jul-24 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
If not, I might take over SE-751b. It's reasonably close to ISA and only requires INS, which I make enough of


[12-Jul-24 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
KW-602c is FP and near etherwind. You can focus that on DW

{Reactions}
🔥 

[12-Jul-24 01:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ah, good idea. I was just running RIGs and FP on etherwind to make DW in one planet, so that's a good next step


[12-Jul-24 01:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah it can be a pretty big boost once you have the permits and ships


[12-Jul-24 07:32 PM] exeler#0000
That reminds me, I have some auctions to put up tonight. I've forgotten about my growing stockpile of agriculture products at the CX for a while now 😅


[14-Jul-24 08:34 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Need help finding a good planet to smelt glass. WU-070a is a bit too far for an efficient use of my ships. Aside from Vulcan and Deimos, any good smelt planets within 12hrs of Ant


[14-Jul-24 08:39 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I ended up at WU as you can do it all on the one planet (as you can also mine the SIO). You can do a round trip in a starter ship with one load of fuel, but it does take 24 hours return trip.


[14-Jul-24 08:48 AM] akyantor#0000
I think all the other nearer planets would have additional building requirements (INS, SEA or HSE), and you'd need to ship in the SIO


[14-Jul-24 08:58 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The time is really the issues here. Although it is very useful to be able to do it all at once


[14-Jul-24 08:58 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Gonna have to rework my ship schedule to fit it in I guess


[14-Jul-24 08:59 AM] akyantor#0000
For what it's worth the glass products seem quite light, so you don't have to go there too often once you're up and running


[14-Jul-24 08:59 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah poop probably gonna set it up for once a week


[14-Jul-24 08:59 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m trying to fit 4 bases on my new WCB route but it’s not easy


[14-Jul-24 09:00 AM] akyantor#0000
I gave up trying to be clever, and just operate a hub (AI CX) and spoke (all the bases) approach. Just visit each base once or twice a week (for a few which have much heavier goods)


[14-Jul-24 09:01 AM] akyantor#0000
I was tying myself up in knots at one point trying to go between multiple planets. 😛


[14-Jul-24 09:01 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah that’s what I do as well expect for Alo from nascent into Vulcan/Deimos. I guess I can make them go straight to Nike to free up time to go to WU


[14-Jul-24 09:01 AM] akyantor#0000
I think it's probably a lot more efficient to try and do some kind of route though


[14-Jul-24 09:02 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If I had more money I’d get an extra ship but I’m 40 mil in debt… o don’t have this luxury

[14-Jul-24 09:03 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't feel so bad about the loans I took from the ADI folks to get my 2x WCB upgrades now.


[14-Jul-24 09:03 AM] akyantor#0000
A mere triffle by comparison


[14-Jul-24 09:05 AM] akyantor#0000
What did you invest the funds in?


[14-Jul-24 09:06 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I figured if a base has a ROI of 14-20 days and I can get a 30-45 day loan, might as well put down as many of those as possible


[14-Jul-24 09:07 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So I’m currently laying down bases 8 to 12 now that I have a forth ship


[14-Jul-24 09:07 AM] akyantor#0000
Wow, that's quite some expansion


[14-Jul-24 09:07 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm almost 3 months in, and have only just shipped out the supplies to put down my 7th base.


[14-Jul-24 09:07 AM] katinga#0000
And not one of those is on one of my planets 😢


[14-Jul-24 09:08 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I haven’t been able to get a good roi on fuel yet


[14-Jul-24 09:08 AM] katinga#0000
it takes a while.  I did the bulk of the legwork, though, putting in the infrastructure


[14-Jul-24 09:08 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
For my strategy to work I need excellent ROI, I aim for 14 days max


[14-Jul-24 09:09 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd be tempted to have a fuel sideline once I've finished my current set of plans. I've two more bases to place, and then I'll have my initial plans to do bfab/lfab, and most of the re-req materials for rfabs complete.


[14-Jul-24 09:09 AM] akyantor#0000
The alternative sideline is DW/RAT, as there's almost endless demand for them.


[14-Jul-24 09:10 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’ve had a lot of success with chemistry


[14-Jul-24 09:10 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm heavily in chemistry already (as can be seen with my auctions). EPO/PE/PG/NR


[14-Jul-24 09:11 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv got 3 chem bases making approx 80k profit per day each


[14-Jul-24 09:11 AM] katinga#0000
TBF, AMM alone is in fairly high demand.  That's what I'm running on Romulus


[14-Jul-24 09:11 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I do PG/CL/NS and about to add EPO into the mix


[14-Jul-24 09:12 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
And I have 2 500 area smelting bases for AL with all inputs integrated or on their way to being self produced


[14-Jul-24 09:14 AM] akyantor#0000
I did think about going into INS, would have needed AMM, but quite a few other folks have started to focus on it, so will do more basic fab stuff first.


[14-Jul-24 09:15 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Aluminum Alliance have a project going on to mass produce it so iv stayed away from it


[14-Jul-24 09:15 AM] mrsmith33#0000
ZV-194d is Metallurgy


[14-Jul-24 09:15 AM] akyantor#0000
ADI also have some folks doing it... so probably not a good place to be for now, until it's seen how they affect the market


[14-Jul-24 09:16 AM] katinga#0000
AMM or SF?


[14-Jul-24 09:16 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
iNS


[14-Jul-24 09:16 AM] akyantor#0000
That's the close option, more expensive to setup though as it requires SEA and INS, as well as shipping in SIO. It's a trade off I think between distance and setup capital expense.


[14-Jul-24 09:17 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah I’ve been convinced to find a way to make WU-70 work


[14-Jul-24 09:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
Make sure you bring at least a couple weeks of consumables to your bases. 4 ships should be plenty for 12 bases. Try bumping up the FTL fuel use if you're still tight. Its increase is linear so you get equal bang for your buck


[14-Jul-24 09:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
I run 26 bases on basically 7 ships, though I have 9 for just in cases


[14-Jul-24 09:44 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 1 ship per 5 bases


[14-Jul-24 10:53 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I work in 12hr increments to help logistics so I only have to log on twice a day for 15 minutes in case I get busy


[14-Jul-24 10:53 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My schedule could be stretched a bit but I wanna be able to accumulate at the bases


[14-Jul-24 10:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Smelting is also very logistically demanding


[14-Jul-24 10:56 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My WCB barely covers Nacsent/Deimos/vulcan and still needs 1 trip per week of a LCB to feed the C/O/fx


[14-Jul-24 03:02 PM] akyantor#0000
I decided to split ALO extraction and smelting in the end, preserves the option to double AL production later if I want. Just popped half a permit of extraction on Nascent, as my 7th base. 🙂

I know you're on a tight schedule right now, but for my 2c; Wu is a great planet for me since the biggest import I have is POP consumables. Fill it with 60 days of RAT & COF and come take stuff away every 2 months for a massive payout (or sooner if I need the mats).

if Churaviis is retiring, we'll need someone (or 2) to setup a UPF line


[15-Jul-24 08:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
easier said than done, I suppose. It's several bases worth


[15-Jul-24 08:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
electronics for SNMs and WAIs, manufacturing for PSL and PSMs and to support APF to make NV1s and COMs, then it's a construction building


[15-Jul-24 08:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
plus ASM inputs are needed, but we have people who can support that. I think we have 3 guys with an APF right now: Archiel, me and allocator


[15-Jul-24 08:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 1 APF

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Jul-24 08:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
you'll also need a PHF on a chem planet for ADRs


[15-Jul-24 08:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What are the demand figures?


[15-Jul-24 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
should be enough to keep 1 UPF fully occupied


[15-Jul-24 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
rest can be sold on market


[15-Jul-24 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
looks like 1 UPF can make a single BR1 and CQM/CQL within 10 days


[15-Jul-24 09:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
which is quite slow compared to our other parts, I can make an FSE in a week and cargo bays in just a few days


[15-Jul-24 09:03 AM] mrsmith33#0000
At least UPF only needs PIO and SET


[15-Jul-24 09:03 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, you just need the SCI and ENG for the other buildings 😄


[15-Jul-24 09:03 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I think I can make a WEL + UPF base, and free space for PP4 on Nike


[15-Jul-24 09:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
Aceland perhaps?


[15-Jul-24 09:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
you have the electronics base setup already to support?


[15-Jul-24 09:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 3 Construction bases already: Nike(PP3, PP4,WEL), 194b(PP2), Aceland(PP3)

ah yeah, that should be able to cover a lot of the need


[15-Jul-24 09:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you lack any of the parts though, I make literally every input to the UPF (except the PHF/DRS ones) so just let me know


[15-Jul-24 09:06 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I want to replace one ELP with one DRS


[15-Jul-24 09:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
you'll need the SAR


[15-Jul-24 09:14 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I may need a third electronics base then


[15-Jul-24 09:33 AM] melon164#0000
I have three APF


[15-Jul-24 09:34 AM] melon164#0000
I've also previously run a stupid amount of UPFs and will be doing so again


[15-Jul-24 09:35 AM] melon164#0000
I don't really have the space to run the several plastics bases that are needed


[15-Jul-24 09:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
great, try to get a stockpile of bridge and crew parts I suppose


[15-Jul-24 09:56 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I might be interested in getting in on ship construction eventually as well (will be free to expand in 1-2 weeks)
I you have a lack of anything just let me know and I’ll see what I can setup


[15-Jul-24 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Woah for a minute there I thought you posted my Phobos base 😆


[15-Jul-24 10:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Almost identical to what I  had a few weeks ago


[15-Jul-24 10:20 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Already replaced one ELP with one DRS?


[15-Jul-24 10:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nahhhh, not doing drones myself.


[15-Jul-24 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I have 4 APFs now, 2 SPFs, and 1 SPP. I can just barely supply them so I'm not expecting a lot of free ASM supplies out of me.


[15-Jul-24 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have any UPFs, but I have a pile of PSM / PSL, although I cut back production there in favor of ship parts


[15-Jul-24 10:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think Churaviis sent me most of his UPF outputs. I have:
1 BR1, 2x BR2, 1x CQL, 6x CQM, 2x CQS, 4x CQT, 6x BRS, 4x RDS, 3x RDL


[15-Jul-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think he still has sell orders up for some bridges and such, I think those might just end up staying at this point


[15-Jul-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh he sent a ton of SRDs


[15-Jul-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
He was my Iodine supplier, so my MHLs might come to a stop.. which probably means I need to drop my 13 WEL down on Nike. So I guess making a UPF would be good use of that space.


[15-Jul-24 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Wouldn't hurt to have me and MrSmith both with one, assuming we can supply it.


[15-Jul-24 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I kiiiiinda need a planet just full of PPFs


[15-Jul-24 10:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think I can source I for you - I’m not using my halcyon base for anything else currently


[15-Jul-24 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
Well, I mine CLI on Elon, and he turned it to iodine there, so he ran the BMPs


[15-Jul-24 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
Which means Elon should change too 😬


[15-Jul-24 10:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
I could drop a WPL or two on Heph and replace it with BMPs if that helps


[15-Jul-24 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
that base predates the chemistry COGC


[15-Jul-24 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmmm I better do some thinking

that's the best kind of thinking


[15-Jul-24 10:54 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I think without Churavis, I will need a base on SE-110d for FEO (+ INC)


[15-Jul-24 11:13 AM] melon164#0000
Was Churavis also supplying MG on Elon?

[15-Jul-24 11:19 AM] melon164#0000
What throughput?  I'm already running 5 manufacturing experts on Elon for my SPFs, so it might make sense for me to pick that up


[15-Jul-24 11:20 AM] melon164#0000
Don't need so much gold production right now with fewer QCRs in the pipeline


[15-Jul-24 11:20 AM] melon164#0000

I'm making progress on my fab plans. Have my ALO base up on Nascent... and just about to setup on Nike (initially just LST/BDE production). Next step is to get FLX production on 759d using that LST, and then get the smelting up on Vulcan. Then expand Nike to all lfabs and bfabs.


[17-Jul-24 04:43 PM] parisinspringtime#0000

[17-Jul-24 06:47 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So question for you guys, if I setup production for 400 NS/day. Is the market gonna crash and how bad?


[17-Jul-24 06:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Would bring my surplus to 600/day


[17-Jul-24 06:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No I don’t think it would


[17-Jul-24 06:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But there are also other things you can make with a CHP if you feel like it was a bad choice


[17-Jul-24 06:50 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv optimized my routes and in found room for 1 more chem base


[17-Jul-24 06:50 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What would you make? Prun planner gives me 100k/day


[17-Jul-24 06:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
CL


[17-Jul-24 06:51 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

Sorry HAL to make CL


[17-Jul-24 06:52 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

A lot of useful things


[17-Jul-24 06:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This would be the 4th CHEM base i setup in Ant within the last 2 weeks so I don’t want to overdo it with the best setups


[17-Jul-24 06:56 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
And stay diversified


[17-Jul-24 06:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not gonna tell you how to play the game but maybe make things other than CHEM?


[17-Jul-24 06:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I make a lot of smelting as well


[17-Jul-24 06:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
And my own C


[17-Jul-24 06:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Just that Chemisty is very ship efficient


[17-Jul-24 06:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I make 400AL/day and fully supply the inputs


[17-Jul-24 07:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That’s true it is pretty efficient


[17-Jul-24 09:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really think there's a risk of oversupplying CL, because if there's too much anyone can start making more into EPO and afabs, and the market is unlimited for afabs.


[17-Jul-24 09:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean at some point you should stop making CL bases and make TCL/EPO bases instead- if you haven't got any (or have a friend do that)


[17-Jul-24 09:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, I think NS is in a pretty similar situation. It's probably somewhat elastic since 1) someone can spin up a HYF and use up a lot quickly and 2) it's already pretty deeply used, it's not a niche item


[17-Jul-24 09:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see a lot of people making 3k NS a week


[17-Jul-24 09:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
you'd be well in the single digits of percentage of NS production still.


[17-Jul-24 10:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
also I have like, 8 chem bases


[17-Jul-24 10:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
so 4 chem bases, you still got a ways to go 😄


[18-Jul-24 02:47 AM] akyantor#0000
Thanks. I’ll bare that in mind, may want to give up the EXT on Nike when I expand in a bit, so good to have the option.


[18-Jul-24 02:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Do we need more ES/EES?


[18-Jul-24 05:26 AM] melon164#0000
I feel like I'm successfully covering corp needs for HPR/HYR, but I really hope the external market will grow 🤷‍♂️


[18-Jul-24 05:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Looked into it and CL/EPO is definitely a better choice. I’m just putting down a FAB base so I’m gonna use up most of the EPO anyways

I am thinking about posting a bulletin on UFO to advertise for Romulus.  Should I post now or wait one more POPR cycle?


[18-Jul-24 09:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the advanced ship components in general take a lot more processing time. There's plenty of capital out there to buy them, it's just a matter of 1. if all the pros need mroe ships and 2. availability of mats to upgrade shields


[18-Jul-24 09:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
And I think EES -> HYR is part of that


[18-Jul-24 09:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am planning my new ships to be maxed out, mayyyyyybe eventually updating shields on old ones


[18-Jul-24 02:42 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I think I should do a CL base on KI-840c next, followed by EPO base somewhere


[18-Jul-24 02:43 PM] mrsmith33#0000
New PP3 base is getting hungry


[20-Jul-24 06:05 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is anyone making GC for sale? I want to replace WEL with PP4 and I need 13 GC/day


[20-Jul-24 11:51 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I now have 9 PP4 on Nike


[20-Jul-24 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000

[20-Jul-24 12:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Doesn't really matter, probably like 200/u


[20-Jul-24 12:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Comparable to what I charge for MHL out of my WEL


[25-Jul-24 12:20 PM] mrsmith33#0000
How about making a third construction planet in Nike system on Antares III c?

[25-Jul-24 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000

[25-Jul-24 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
plus you gotta factor in overhead


[26-Jul-24 02:47 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Classic mistake, missed 2 LSE somewhere when bringing building mats


[26-Jul-24 10:47 AM] katinga#0000
Any suggestions on what I should do for programs on Rom C and Remus?  I got too much pop until more bases are settled there.  apparently that drives down Life Support as well, and no one's happy


[26-Jul-24 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess Remus probably needs a settler immigration job


[26-Jul-24 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
romulus with 61% unemployment on pioneers I probably wouldn't run anything


[26-Jul-24 10:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
unless you really want to continue pumping up the pop, then festival 3. but I'd only do that if you were expecting a lot of bases


[26-Jul-24 10:59 AM] katinga#0000
I'm the only one on Remus, atm.  there's nowhere for settlers to go once my base is full.

{Reactions}
👍 

[26-Jul-24 11:01 AM] katinga#0000
I think I am the only one active on Rom C, as well.  The other bases there are from players that quit


[26-Jul-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
gotcha. I just saw the 200 open settler jobs there, if it's filling at 38 a week it'll take a while


[26-Jul-24 11:27 AM] katinga#0000
yeah those are what I still have open

Lowest ROI on prunplanner!


[26-Jul-24 09:17 PM] hernanduer#0000

the price for INS is rising.
i'm thinking about building my own small INS-production.

is somebody selling AR?


[29-Jul-24 01:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think Paris has a tap?


[30-Jul-24 07:11 AM] katinga#0000
I would definitely buy INS from ya.  I had to buy of CX last time.


[30-Jul-24 07:11 AM] katinga#0000
anyone else notice the spike in LST prices at ANT?


[30-Jul-24 07:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Do it! I have my own INS production, but I can’t meet the needs of the corp. I buy AR off the CX usually, but if enough people here use it I can set up a base for it


[30-Jul-24 07:27 AM] melon164#0000
I have space on KI-401d, I could tap some AR


[30-Jul-24 07:31 AM] katinga#0000
What's a pirate's favorite element? Arrrrrrgon!

Do we need more RAT production? The market is going nuts.


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can expand to Life and a new FP planet somewhere. I’m just severely limited on NS right now


[30-Jul-24 02:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
That and I probably need to put a limit on ADI orders now. I’ve sold a few batches of 2k+ there, and there’s too many people to supply there while supplying everyone here


[30-Jul-24 03:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have some NS I could sell you


[30-Jul-24 03:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can make more NS no problem if you need


[30-Jul-24 03:06 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m already overproducing 200/day so it’s not an issue

Yeah it changes once you are out of permits, heh

Iv noticed my profit across the board have gone down recently, not to sure why


[30-Jul-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv tried to find the source and coudnt pin point it


[30-Jul-24 03:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably price fluctuations, esp with the change to the new market indexes. I think PMMG is using them as well as prunplanner.


[30-Jul-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
ah i see


[30-Jul-24 03:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is it mining the AIC that the market makers buy EDC with..? Or gold pressed latinum? Or am I the only HEX producer in the whole universe???


[30-Jul-24 03:38 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My CHEM bases that were at 80-100k are now more like 60-70

[30-Jul-24 03:39 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I feel like im getting quite confortable with the mecanics of the game. But I still lack quite a bit of knowledge on the "Content" of it


[30-Jul-24 03:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
HEX has no use, but I am betting on the fact that it will be part of gateway fuel.


[30-Jul-24 03:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
So the price is meaningless at the moment

[30-Jul-24 07:45 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I just expanded Norwick to 2 permits so that will increase my RAT production.  I had been selling a lot of excess agricultural products to the market though, so it may not make much difference.


[30-Jul-24 07:52 PM] tuffyless#0000
coincidence ... I just downsized on Norwick from 2 perms to 1.  
Got 3 FP planets though at KW-602c, Norwick, 110a.


[30-Jul-24 07:56 PM] tuffyless#0000
So I have 2 permits/planets with only HYF's.  110b & Life.  
Those 2 HYF farms feed the 3 above FP planets, 1 INC/Carbon farm, maybe 5 WPL's with RCO to COT.


[30-Jul-24 07:56 PM] tuffyless#0000
HYF pretty powerful 😉

{Reactions}
💯 (2) 

[30-Jul-24 08:03 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah, I downsized Harmonia from 3 permits to just 1 producing only RCO and HER, Life is why I am one of the top producers of mushrooms!


[30-Jul-24 08:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
So. Do any of you need a new FP planet? 🙂


[30-Jul-24 08:09 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I have been considering it


[30-Jul-24 08:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
SE-751b?


[30-Jul-24 08:12 PM] tuffyless#0000
Not considering permits, I would. 🙂  
haha but that'd be the straw to break the camels back ... another FP base would need a 3rd HYF base.


[30-Jul-24 08:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
That’s fair 😄


[30-Jul-24 08:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d been looking at SE-751b because it’s close to SE-110. Only needs INS, and completely empty


[30-Jul-24 08:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t want to run incinerators, so I basically still have half of SE-110b to fill up with HYFs


[30-Jul-24 08:13 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That's what I really need.  A base producing nothing but INS!

even restorted to buying off the CX :\


[30-Jul-24 08:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I’m trying to help some folks in ADI run INS bases selling to the CX, but it’s been a slow start


[30-Jul-24 08:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
what is a bottle neck for INS?


[30-Jul-24 08:17 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Argon

[30-Jul-24 08:18 PM] tuffyless#0000
yep.  AR only ingredient I dont produce


[30-Jul-24 08:18 PM] draconisdomini#0000
And it needs PP3, so you need Technicians on whatever planet


[30-Jul-24 08:19 PM] tuffyless#0000
kinda makes the SE-751b HYF topic seem like a totally different subject 😆


[30-Jul-24 08:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Is there any AR production in Antares space? Seems like the only one that is inhabited is KI-401d


[30-Jul-24 08:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not HYF, FPs! If I have anything to say about it, anyway 😄


[30-Jul-24 08:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
KI-401d is the only one I know of

same as 401d

All Bfabs except BTA are basically at the market maker cap

Given LST prices as they've been, BSE MM is kinda crazy low.

I pretty much only make fabs for my own use

what pros and cons on having 1 base having 1 building type


[30-Jul-24 10:02 PM] tuffyless#0000
pros all around, if all the buildings align to the CoGC, and one feeds the other.


[30-Jul-24 10:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely worth keeping a base to one COGC. Sometimes that's more than one building. Often it's only one. Much easier to manage a base when it only has one product though


[30-Jul-24 10:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
I mean like, what's stopping me having 20 BMPs on heph


[30-Jul-24 10:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh well you can do a mix


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like BMP and WPL


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But nothing stops you from either


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] tuffyless#0000
making sgure you have the input flow to keep all 20 busy 24/7


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
that's why I am asking Mix vs Mono


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
Since I can't fit every Manufacturing building for 1 permit


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
and 2 permits per base is a waste


[30-Jul-24 10:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Mix gives you more queue slots

[30-Jul-24 10:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
is there a reason why there is a limit of permits per base? as well as 250 area instead of 500 per permit

did devs explained or it's just a thing

I think just so  one person can't super charge a single base


[30-Jul-24 10:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
make sense but considering that there isn't that much people playing this game and the size of the map


[31-Jul-24 03:34 AM] melon164#0000
I'm going to switch my KI-401d base to produce some AR.  How much do we need?

I think that's reasonable. Eventually you'll want to move the WPLs off planet since they are manufacturing, and they are big slow buildings.


[31-Jul-24 05:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if you have CL coming in that's a very low effort planet to run


[31-Jul-24 05:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is always nice

A bit better version of same concept but 2 permits 👀


[31-Jul-24 06:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m kinda of a purist for that but long term, it is much better to stick to 1 permit per base


[31-Jul-24 06:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Make sure to test with your full set of experts also


[31-Jul-24 06:40 PM] archielvahr#0000

[31-Jul-24 06:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Why don’t you just make 2 bases 1 Chem 1 manufacturing?


[31-Jul-24 06:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
Less logistics


[31-Jul-24 06:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
With gates and easier logistics 1 permit per base is better


[31-Jul-24 06:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Those bases should only require 1 delivery of a 2k/2k each


[31-Jul-24 06:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

I'm not at full size yet on Nike, but feels good to finally have reached the point that I'm creating my own bfab/lfabs with input materials nearly all within my own supply chain (except small quantities of O, and the consumables). 

Looking forward to filling out the rest of the permit soon, and that'll make it easier for me to expand in future with cheaper fabs. Just need to finish my AL expansion first otherwise I'd run out of AL.

But that 90d volume jump in CX trades, maybe that's some sort of shift from shadow markets to the CX or something...? I don't know why though

You'd have to buy one at 99k first!

total supply of HEX on the CX is only 50 units.


[09-Aug-24 04:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
you know, HEX might be a good vehicle for completely dubious money transfers in the meantime, for people who don't have pro


[09-Aug-24 04:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah to some extent. They have to stay inside the price band if they don't have pro


[09-Aug-24 04:55 PM] archielvahr#0000

[12-Aug-24 07:45 AM] archielvahr#0000
There is a lot of information on how gateways are intended to work. I think this confirms my expectations about linking distance


[12-Aug-24 07:47 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, a suprisingly illuminating post. I should have guessed that they'd re-use the upgrade mechanic for popi, so you can increase various capabilities of the gateway over time.


[12-Aug-24 07:47 AM] akyantor#0000
There's a hint in there that we might see early parts of this in live sooner than we might expect too. i.e. they may incrementally release some elements.


[12-Aug-24 07:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Time to claim more valuable systems/planets via base establishment fees


[12-Aug-24 08:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
That's the trick, most far away ones are just bad AND far away, lol


[12-Aug-24 08:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
If they're expecting the planets to fit within a list, that had me a little concerned with how much range a particular gate can have


[12-Aug-24 08:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
Or it's just gonna be a really big list


[12-Aug-24 08:53 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Or it’s only the planets with gates that would appear


[12-Aug-24 09:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah we don’t know if it’s gate to gate or not. I sort of assume it’s “gate to anywhere in range”.


[12-Aug-24 09:34 AM] melon164#0000
I thought I remembered them mentioning gate-to-gate.  I can't find it now though


[12-Aug-24 09:50 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess that's an assumption. I'd sort of assumed it was a gate-to-gate thing, rather than a one-way gate to a location.


[12-Aug-24 09:51 AM] akyantor#0000
It could be:
- Gate to Gate - bi-directional
- Gate to location - uni-directional
- Gate to location - bi-directional


[12-Aug-24 09:52 AM] akyantor#0000
It would appear to be the first option:

[12-Aug-24 09:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im very curious as to how the capacity will be managed.
Is it going to be a waiting line?
Can you white list/ black list corps to reserve capacity for your corp?


[12-Aug-24 09:54 AM] akyantor#0000
That means the list wont' be all that long unless there are a "lot" of gateways. You've got to imagine the the cost to build will be non-trivial, or perhaps non-trivial for an interesting "range".


[12-Aug-24 09:56 AM] akyantor#0000
I wonder if there will be a charging mechanic. It occurs to me for a more central based gateway then users may not always be folks with a base on the planatary government that has sponsored the gate.


[12-Aug-24 09:56 AM] katinga#0000
or a toll!


[12-Aug-24 09:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, ideally there'd be some kind of toll mechanic.


[12-Aug-24 09:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
They are playing up the cost of the gateway construction but I'm not sure what they consider to be a lot. Like level 18 HQ or level 28 HQ, big differences 😄


[12-Aug-24 09:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think they said there will be a toll that is charged by the planetary government in order to cover the fuel

{Reactions}
👍 

[12-Aug-24 09:58 AM] akyantor#0000
You'd imagine a range cost will exponentially grow a bit like HQ level costs do


[12-Aug-24 09:59 AM] akyantor#0000
As you say, makes a big difference how that scaling function works


[12-Aug-24 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds like they will release the GTWI tool before the gateways itself, so we will be able to calculate distances

Can you take a gateway if you don't have an FTL drive?? ooh that would mix things up in an interesting way


[12-Aug-24 10:10 AM] katinga#0000
or extend the range of starter ships


[12-Aug-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
If it's gate to gate, I'd expect it to be instantaneous


[12-Aug-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
and it does seem to be gate to gate


[12-Aug-24 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
like are we talking stargate tech, EVE tech or something else? It's instant for both of those


[12-Aug-24 10:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
if it's just a big accelerator, that kinda diminishes its use a bit I think, unless the acceleration is like 100x


[12-Aug-24 10:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
at that point it might as well be instant


[12-Aug-24 10:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
do both gates have to have the range to connect, or is it uni-directional range?


[12-Aug-24 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
or is it just based on which gate you're launching from, it has to reach the other? It sounded to me like the gateway companion choice is semi-permanent, so it's not like someone can drive up and pick whichever one they need that's in range


[12-Aug-24 10:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
if the range is required bi-directionally, there will be a lot of one-way trips in the beginning where you have to slow boat back to CX lol


[12-Aug-24 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Since the gateway UI seems to list connectable systems but doesn’t have a place to pick a connection, my guess is the connections don’t have to be pre chosen.


[12-Aug-24 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Good question about uni directional range though


[12-Aug-24 10:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe any recipient gateway can doesn’t need to fulfill requirements

[12-Aug-24 10:55 AM] akyantor#0000
It does mention something about linking gates though, in todays post.


[12-Aug-24 10:55 AM] akyantor#0000
This would imply that there is some "linking" between gates: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/870777970367811604/1272568280217030824


[12-Aug-24 11:00 AM] akyantor#0000
I’d like connections to Demeter and Haylos . It’s hard to imagine you’d be able to afford building return connections from Hyalos given the relatively small population. I guess it depends on how the split the costs, whether it’s weighted towards the initial build or towards the fuel costs


[12-Aug-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
Demeter is a planet we pretty much control, and it's pretty close to bridging the gap to OS-099


[12-Aug-24 11:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
I figure the best choice is funding a gate in Ant 1 as a corp, then funding a second gate on Demeter to jump to OS-099


[12-Aug-24 11:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
if they're paired semi-permanently, then we have to build a second gate on Demeter to link back to Ant


[12-Aug-24 11:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
Phobos is hard to control given it's a starter planet, but it should be easy enough to justify a link to Demeter given it's the only other fertile planet in Ant space


[12-Aug-24 11:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
but the other planets are all run by Rise through and through, so...


[12-Aug-24 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah I missed that note. That must be what that means.


[12-Aug-24 11:17 AM] katinga#0000
I would love a shortcut to Demeter.  it takes almost a day to get a ship there.  Etherwind too


[12-Aug-24 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I think it's an easily palatable choice, and we can fund it wholly if necessary, depending on cost


[12-Aug-24 11:54 AM] mrsmith33#0000

[12-Aug-24 01:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m opting without reason that it would use Rfabs. I find Afabs are already in quite short supply and so complexe most players can’t make any


[12-Aug-24 01:50 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m also biaised from the fact that I’m making a lot of them


[12-Aug-24 01:51 PM] akyantor#0000
Tbh, would be be surprised it if was a mix. May end up looking a lot more like ship production, than production building.


[12-Aug-24 01:51 PM] akyantor#0000
That’s, a lot more variety of components


[12-Aug-24 01:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I like the idea of components. Would make them very rare and expensive

STL ships will be able to use gateways.


[12-Aug-24 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I imagine a lot of 100m+ players will be looking to buy whatever they can to build gateways. And cash generally outstrips supply of afabs and rfabs. Plus APF products and those sorts of things. I expect they will use LOG or ADS and maybe even TAC.


[12-Aug-24 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
They said they will be expensive. We just don’t know what that means to the devs.


[12-Aug-24 02:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since they have a lot of levels it will probably scale like HQ costs.

I was looking at Argon again and according to the commodity production leaderboards there are very few people producing Argon (only 16 over the last week.  Building out a complete 500 area base on KI-401d for Argon production would produce 477/day, compared with total production in the entire universe at present of 1296/day...

That would certainly drop AR prices considerably, and by an extension probably bring down INS prices too


[12-Aug-24 03:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
That'll probably be a good ways off if their "we hope to do this" statements in the past have shown anything. So better off locking it down with a planet like Demeter


[12-Aug-24 03:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
Could even pick something silly if we're range limited, a new planet we can lock down. Of course most of my discussion has been about project 6115, but that's just because it's the most interesting 😋


[12-Aug-24 03:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
I fully anticipate HTE STL ships ferrying things between the 4 major CXs within the first month


[12-Aug-24 03:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
So that's not so interesting, unless you wanna be in the engine market


[12-Aug-24 04:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
We can lock down a planet in ANT 1 if it is crappy.


[12-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe someone should do that quick.


[12-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like one of those gas giants without any population or resources.


[12-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh I guess we can’t totally lock down a faction space planet. But with 4 permits we’d have it on an effective voting lock down


[12-Aug-24 04:39 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Can be made into a chem planet


[12-Aug-24 05:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think paying for a gate to Demeter should be easy enough, most people are reasonable in game. I'd rather use my permits on the project directly  😉


[12-Aug-24 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
ANT 1f has only one person on it and they are inactive. So that's an option if we want to go that route.


[16-Aug-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Added some stuff to the mapping tool to calculate Gateway distances between systems

can you pin the way to access that map again? This channel probably needs its pins cleaned up

I am redoing the website since that edited map is localhost only at the moment

Does anyone in the corp make BRM? I'm considering dropping a base on IY-206j


[18-Aug-24 02:33 AM] melon164#0000
I had a base there once.  Not any more though


[18-Aug-24 02:36 AM] allocater#0000
what technology did you use for this?


[18-Aug-24 09:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
The map is Taiyi's map with a bunch of changes. It's written in React and D3 for the node drawing and visualization stuff. The map itself is a big SVG and you can pick out parts of the SVG by systemID and add components to it that way

Heh, I still whip out php sometimes when I need to make some web stuff


[18-Aug-24 09:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
The rest of the OOG website is Hugo, a static site generator


[18-Aug-24 09:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's my second Hugo page, and I'm not really sure what I think about it. If you get a nice template, it looks really good. Most templates (including this one) have some sort of issues that prevent it from "just working". And it's inevitable that you need to edit the template a fair bit. So basically you need to have full knowledge of HTML and CSS anyway to make a hugo page. Then y ou also need to know markdown and whatever random npm libraries the hugo template uses. Each template usually uses at least 20 of those. So for this page the only one I needed to really mess with was Tailwind, and some hugo version mismatches that needed cleaning


[18-Aug-24 01:24 PM] exeler#0000
Sounds like my experience every time I try to contribute to a project that uses npm.

I think the number one wormhole would be ANT to Griffonstone

SE-648a as well


[21-Aug-24 01:57 PM] katinga#0000
For micrometeroid density is a bigger number worse or a lower number worse?


[21-Aug-24 02:01 PM] katinga#0000
the Romulan system is 2.9 and the Ant2 system is 0.3.  SE-648 is 4.6.  But it's just... numbers.  something like 4.6ppm would be helpful


[21-Aug-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
big numbers are bad


[21-Aug-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's 4.6 "giant rocks per m3"


[21-Aug-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
SE-648 is basically flying through soup

I might be interested


[24-Aug-24 06:03 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’d have to make a few calculation before hand


[24-Aug-24 06:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I'd forecast around 29/u a day


[24-Aug-24 06:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Great thanks, I’d need like a day to calculate things


[24-Aug-24 06:26 PM] akyantor#0000
No worries. tbh, I can probably sell some into the CX anyway.


[24-Aug-24 07:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d also buy small amounts- thinking of setting up a few PP4 to make afabs semi-regularly 🙂


[24-Aug-24 07:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Same, planning on PP4 and that would avoid needing a smelting base

should we buy millions of SF for 16, because it will never be this cheap ever again? 😄


[26-Aug-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't see a reason why it would suddenly go below 16 as a result of this change

soooo the logic seems sound

this will not look pretty on their eco report 😅


[26-Aug-24 02:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ll drop like 1M on SF at each CX and hold onto it


[26-Aug-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well I bought everything on BEN under 16 and it was only 1m


[26-Aug-24 02:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Except BEN I guess 😛


[26-Aug-24 02:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
you can still buy at the MM price, hehe


[26-Aug-24 02:43 PM] allocater#0000
the more you buy the more you can sell for 16.1 in the after-times 😄

imagine the entire fuel production collapsing because the market is running on the old MM stock for the next years 😄

I think it's just a pain


[26-Aug-24 02:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
you need significant shipping and a few bases to get it set up

31k of AMM, 50k GAL, 50kH to make 240k SF


[26-Aug-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
but 83k/d isn't bad for a base. its a 2k ship every other day whiich might be tough for n ew players, but it's balanced weight wise, (if you are bringing from the CX and not straight from a H tap)


[27-Aug-24 09:48 AM] hernanduer#0000

I’ve got 125k at each CX


[27-Aug-24 09:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
You know the Gamestop thingy? What if people will pump their SF production to get that 18 AIC per SF bases and lower the price even more (lower then 16) 😅


[27-Aug-24 09:55 AM] marat_sh#0000

Yeah, it’s not like the fuel will go bad


[27-Aug-24 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
If all else fails I’ll list it all at 16.5 and forget about it until fuel goes through the roof again 😁


[27-Aug-24 09:58 AM] katinga#0000
especially SF.  You burn more of it than FF


[27-Aug-24 09:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
depends entirely on your destinations, I definitely use more FF than SF


[27-Aug-24 09:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
also because FF scales linearly with use, while SF is logarithmic


[27-Aug-24 10:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
you get more bang for the buck with that FF use


[27-Aug-24 10:01 AM] marat_sh#0000

that slider is so bad

{Reactions}
👆 

[27-Aug-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
it scales based on how much fuel is in the tanks


[27-Aug-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
so I think, if you can move fuel into your cargo bay, then you max the slider it'll use all the fuel that's in there

[27-Aug-24 10:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
Ah I see


[27-Aug-24 10:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
so set it to 50% and give fuel that it needs


[27-Aug-24 10:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
problem that fuel consumption will very depending on the distance


[27-Aug-24 10:04 AM] melon164#0000
SF is pretty stable (as long as your flight is interstellar)


[27-Aug-24 10:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
today it took me 100 SF to got from Heph to CX for 7h and yesterday it was 100 SF for 3.5 hours


[27-Aug-24 10:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
depending where the planet is


[27-Aug-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, also depends on the route the planner takes


[27-Aug-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
every route can be done from two directions


[27-Aug-24 10:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
We need MechJeb from KSP to plan transfer windows 😅

[27-Aug-24 10:07 AM] katinga#0000
I burn way more SF, but I also can't stand to let my ships use the bare minimum of fuel usage and take forever like Zerg Overlords to get where I need them to go.  I step on the gas a little.


[27-Aug-24 10:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah I feel that


[27-Aug-24 10:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
just max the FF slider, it's worth so much more than SF spend


[27-Aug-24 10:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
yeah difference in time for min and min + 1% is massive 😅


[27-Aug-24 10:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
you can tick SF up maybe a couple ticks, no more than 3


[27-Aug-24 10:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
after that the diminishing returns gets pretty dramatic - also since SF is only spent on departure and arrival, if it's a lot of jumps then the FF use is gonna be more


[27-Aug-24 10:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
and thus FF impact is much higher the more jumps


[27-Aug-24 10:11 AM] melon164#0000
I tend to do ~300-400 SF and max FF, try to get the flight time around 6-7h


[27-Aug-24 10:12 AM] melon164#0000
Ship launch permits are my most limited resource


[27-Aug-24 11:13 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is anyone running an AAF?


[27-Aug-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think we have one unless @melon164  has one. I couldn't fit one in


[27-Aug-24 11:16 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Looks like not

if you guys need to free up some intermediate Manufacturing on Heph to make space for AAF, let me know


[27-Aug-24 11:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
I can take some production of intermediates


[27-Aug-24 11:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd love to lose my PPFs on Heph


[27-Aug-24 11:19 AM] mrsmith33#0000
same, but I will probably make another base just for them


[27-Aug-24 11:20 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 10 PPF on Heph


[27-Aug-24 11:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have 5, but I'm also on all the manufacturing planets


[27-Aug-24 11:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
probably a good plan for OS-099c 😉


[27-Aug-24 11:23 AM] mrsmith33#0000
1.5-2 days of travel though


[27-Aug-24 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
meh, plastic is super light


[27-Aug-24 11:24 AM] mrsmith33#0000
PPFs seem like a good candidate, since inputs/outputs are small


[27-Aug-24 11:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
I will start expanding PPFs so you guys can relocate or remove them


[27-Aug-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
PPFs work great in OS, very low shipping


[27-Aug-24 11:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
it will take me a bit and I will let you know


[27-Aug-24 11:25 AM] mrsmith33#0000
My 100t ship can reach it in 4hr

[28-Aug-24 03:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay so this gigantic sheet. It assumes everything is made at 160% efficiency, with materials sourced from the CX at the average price. I will do a version with home-made materials too. It includes input costs, workforce costs, and building depreciation. It calculates the area to make something based on the size of the building, plus the size of the housing needed to build it.


[28-Aug-24 03:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
So the 500 area col is gonna be on the high end because it's going to assume you have 0 unused space, 0 STO, and you somehow got fractional numbers of SLs built, and no unused pop.


[28-Aug-24 03:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
In practice, I think it's pretty close, esp assuming you probably got a bit over 160% efficiency


[28-Aug-24 03:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
In cases where prices are wonky for precursors, like drones frames or something, it's going to suffer a bit, either too high or too low.


[28-Aug-24 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the best solution is to hand enter override prices on things you can figure out. But that's a ton of work.


[28-Aug-24 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Furthermore, these are the old MM prices, so that needs fixing by hand.


[28-Aug-24 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
but it's a start.


[28-Aug-24 03:41 PM] akyantor#0000
IDC still in the top 10, not bad for something with not supply chain requirements at all other than consumables


[28-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. IDC will probably get worse relatively if you look at drilldowns like this for FFC

[28-Aug-24 04:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
FFCs mats cost 276,500 on the CX


[28-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
But that's cause WAI on the CX is 118k and you could make your own for 70k (assuming you bought the WAI components on the CX!) So it's recursive savings. But then you gotta work that into the area and time cost too.


[28-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you want 1 FFC per day, it takes 270.6 area to do that, assuming you build the entire chain yourself.


[28-Aug-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
(All material inputs but not workforce consumables)


[28-Aug-24 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
for the FFC, 129.0 of that area is in the AFP and employee housing for the AFP


[28-Aug-24 04:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
(because it takes 2.5d / eff to build an FFC, we assume you have (1 / (2.5 / 1.7)) AFPs to do that )


[28-Aug-24 04:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
wow that's a lot of parens


[28-Aug-24 04:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
so is FFC the new MM king? 😄


[28-Aug-24 04:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I gotta put the new numbers in, it's still pretty unclear, heh


[28-Aug-24 04:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
haven't ruled out other bugs too


[28-Aug-24 04:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
And ignored taxes, which is probably fine.


[28-Aug-24 04:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
what? I thought taxes were driving the poor IDC/EDC folks to bankruptcy 😛


[28-Aug-24 04:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
But WAI is common in those top couple. And LOG is software heavy too. so that's likely to be a theme

🎻  🥲

{Reactions}
😄 

[28-Aug-24 04:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
but that's very interesting - I wanna see if I can do something similar to evaluate how far up / down a production chain it makes sense to go (i.e. does making your own WAI over buying from CX increase or decrease total profit / area)


[28-Aug-24 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah you definitely gotta run the numbers. I suspect WAI is good to make on your own, cause it has a big markup, but can't say for sure


[28-Aug-24 10:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay so there were mistakes in that, lol


[28-Aug-24 10:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
For the purpose of MM calcs, you gotta use $185,000.00 for FFC, the MM price, not 370k, which is the CX price


[28-Aug-24 11:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oof it's tough because for SRDs you gotta assume it's being sold at the MM price, but it contains UTS, which you have to assume is not being bought at the MM price.. so you need different prices at different stages of the calculations


[29-Aug-24 11:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Fancy tip, if you want the PP30d_Universe price data, you can get that through the prun planner API

[29-Aug-24 12:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Drones initially look good, because you can do great with 12 DRS on a planet. But if you actually have to make the BSC for them... those are priced at 0, so bam, you need like 1200 area for those 12 DRS. etc. So if you run the math out for the whole chain, it takes a ton of extra area to feed the DRS. It's probably worse than what the sheet is saying there, which is if you make the whole DRS chain, for every 500 area you put into it, you make 105k. per day. I'm a little doubtful on some of that math though. I might want a different approach for it


[29-Aug-24 12:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
IDC and EDC come out pretty great in the final calcs still


[29-Aug-24 12:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm finally done fixing a stupid /dev/mem access issue, so I can try to spreadsheet this too 😄

[29-Aug-24 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
But IDC has no prereq steps so I'm not sure why the sheet is coming out with different numbers in those two columns. I think something is wrong there

HODL IDC/EDC


[29-Aug-24 12:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahhh I fixed the math error. I was missing an efficiency multiplier in one of the area calculations

Uhg, the area calculation for FE was using the AML recipe


[29-Aug-24 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
so many little details


[29-Aug-24 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
so UTS was crazy wrong


[29-Aug-24 01:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have the expansion for one type into all its constituent parts

now I just gotta get the amounts working for that


[29-Aug-24 01:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Tracking both the price and the area used for each constituent part?


[29-Aug-24 01:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
nope! just the breakdown 😄


[29-Aug-24 01:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
just pretty cool to put in FSE and see it pull up ALL the recipes


[29-Aug-24 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah sure


[29-Aug-24 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
One goofy thing I ran into was that I needed to use different prices at different points. So making an SRD uses UTS. But it needs to price that input at 4700 per UTS. But UTS is also a MM, so if you want to sell UTS, it needs to use the 2200/u price.


[29-Aug-24 01:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I would argue if it is indeed gate stuff, there is a high likely hood of those things selling higher than mm off the market I’m the very beginning when all the accumulated great fortunes fight to build gates


[29-Aug-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
At first, I had UTS at 2200, then it made the SRDs too cheap. But you need to use the MM price of the SRDs at 53k instead of the market 97k, because the demand isn't there for that volume


[29-Aug-24 01:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
can you separate them? UTS_MM and UTS_IN?


[29-Aug-24 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's what I ended up doing.. each item has a "production price" = what it would cost to make. A "real price" which is the MM price, and a "main price" = the price to buy it on the CX


[29-Aug-24 01:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
And a checkbox at the sheet to swap which one gets used


[29-Aug-24 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
My price to produce 1 AUO is 85.4, the MM is 137, the CX is 250


[29-Aug-24 01:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's a good point, if you make a ton of weird stuff like LIS or AIR or TAC, hold on to th em for the patch. Just in case they are in gateways


[29-Aug-24 01:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I doubt CCD / SDR / SRD / SUD will be in them


[29-Aug-24 01:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can’t switch my setup and eat up the speculative cost but maybe someone can try to


[29-Aug-24 01:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m sure at auction if the allow someone to build the first gate they’ll be a lot of interest

[29-Aug-24 03:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's really bad at it


[29-Aug-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
you can tweak the iteration count in the prefs, but it doesn't really help


[29-Aug-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
because with prun sheets it doesn't really understand when it needs a refresh


[29-Aug-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
and since it doesn't really seem to converge it gets unhappy with that

I'm iteratively determining the needs of each "root" item


[29-Aug-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
say you want FSE and it'll expand to all needed items and the amount needed


[29-Aug-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
it was working _okay_ with the items by themselves


[29-Aug-24 03:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
but adding in the amounts seems to be overwhelming it


[29-Aug-24 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I'll try fixing all the workforce consumables and then see about iteratively calculating everything else


[29-Aug-24 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
but what I've been doing now is basically summing up the profits for each item as they go up the chain


[29-Aug-24 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
which avoids the iterative issues

[29-Aug-24 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
This sums in profit from earlier phases, which is important for CBL. CBL bases run at a loss if you only run the CBLs with CX priced inputs. But if you make the inputs yourself you capture the income from the earlier steps. So this should be entirely resilient to price variations on the CX of input materials if you look at that one "whole chain" column


[29-Aug-24 04:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think your efficiencies aren't being calculated right


[29-Aug-24 04:15 PM] hernanduer#0000

but I think it should be multiplied by efficiency (oops)


[29-Aug-24 04:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
for example: in apex time for 3 IDC at 176% shows 40 hours to complete


[29-Aug-24 04:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
unmodified is 72 hours


[29-Aug-24 04:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
72/40 = ~1.8


[29-Aug-24 04:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
so it should be that your area behaves the same, but for IDC your area is 13.37


[29-Aug-24 04:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
20/13.37 = 1.5, not 1.8


[29-Aug-24 04:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
should be 20/11.36


[29-Aug-24 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
multiplied by (1/efficiency) is the same as dividing by effiency. if you divide by 1.7, the area gets smaller


[29-Aug-24 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lemme double check though


[29-Aug-24 04:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah yeah, I fixed that 🥲


[29-Aug-24 04:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I did use IDC as the benchmark for testing


[29-Aug-24 04:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
it wouldn't change relative rankings anyway, I think, just the total profit


[29-Aug-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
okay so. Each SL is 23.6 area (counting the workforce). At 100%,  1 IDC should take 24 hours.


[29-Aug-24 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
So it's 1/23.6 =  0.0423 IDC per day per area. 

At 176.50% efficiency it should be that number *1.71 = 0.0747 IDC per day per unit area


[29-Aug-24 04:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
ohhh


[29-Aug-24 04:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
I missed the part where it includes the residences


[29-Aug-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that column you mentioned "Area / (unit*day) - how much area required to make one each day"


[29-Aug-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
(what a mess of units)


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah adding residences I think is important. it assume sfractional production buildings and fractional residences, which is a bummer, but buildings differ wildly


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
BMPs are huge cause they need one house per BMP


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
for sure, I just missed that part


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
And other buildings just use 20 people, 1/5th a building


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was tracing it from the core sheet and it said "stage only", I didn't clarify to myself if that included residences


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure if anyone else has a sheet that tracks area like this


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I've got something now too 😄


[29-Aug-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh gotcha yeah

[29-Aug-24 04:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
no costs though


[29-Aug-24 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sometimes the "last stage" has 0 profit in it, like making CBLs with expensive LI. But if all the profit is locked up in the LI step, then you still have a profitable MM


[29-Aug-24 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
ooh got them big string concats 😄


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
does that mean 4600 Area to make 1 FSE per day?


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVSF-wVkX0xJzo33P_zzPbb8DFfGQjeGv6jLf1MXRVg/edit?usp=sharing


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Does that count workforce consumables?


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
I thought about it but didn't


[29-Aug-24 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am assuming all workforce stuff is bought, and all production inputs have the option of being produced or bought


[29-Aug-24 04:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
it wouldn't be too hard to add if you look at the sheet, it would just require incorporating the consumables into the "production" consumables, then they'd get added up and broken down as well


[29-Aug-24 04:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I sent an access request to that sheet


[29-Aug-24 04:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
got in


[29-Aug-24 04:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
oops done


[29-Aug-24 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have way more wasted nonsense columns hahaha


[29-Aug-24 04:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't have prices in mine either


[29-Aug-24 04:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
so that'd add at least another ridiculous layer of multipliers 😄


[29-Aug-24 04:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
and it's only 1 item a time


[29-Aug-24 04:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well if you have "area per unit per day", you can take the MM value and the CX value and then you have dollar per area per unit per day, and that's what we really want


[29-Aug-24 04:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
yep, I figure that's the easy part


[29-Aug-24 04:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's probably a way better approach than what I did


[29-Aug-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then when you expand out a product, you can get the price for each item and see which ones you should buy and which ones you should make


[29-Aug-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you don't know your production price, that's kind of okay, because you can decide off the income per area... uhhh maybe?


[29-Aug-24 04:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's actually a bit of a flaw, it always picks the recipe with the highest output amount


[29-Aug-24 04:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
so for something like C, it struggles to pick the recipe


[29-Aug-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah yeah, mine picks the recipe with the lowest production price


[29-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I should have done more operations on the recipe level rather t han the material level


[29-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
then compare them at the end


[29-Aug-24 04:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah that makes the most sense


[29-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think drone frames cost more in the WEL but I would make them in the WEL because they are faster


[29-Aug-24 04:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
The cost is higher, but the "sumarea" is way lower in a WEL than a DRS


[29-Aug-24 04:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
That filter picking the DRF takes the first one in the ROutputs?


[29-Aug-24 04:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
think so, yeah


[29-Aug-24 04:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
but looks like WEL is twice as much area as the DRS


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
hmmmmm


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
could be the EXT settings I have


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I just set them all to 10 with like a 10 hour extraction time


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah EXT settings are weird. I also faked them


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
ohhh so I averaged all the planet deposits and picked a mid-upper planet


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's a lot smarter 🙂


[29-Aug-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was lazy


[29-Aug-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah but you need a sheet with all the planets in the game, lmao


[29-Aug-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
so the catch is that Neon is just low on average compared to something like FEO


[29-Aug-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
like 6x or 7x


[29-Aug-24 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think most resources on the CX are extracted at like 90th percentile, so mine is a little low


[29-Aug-24 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's "Extractor Core Price" sheet if you wanna see it


[29-Aug-24 04:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll just borrow those


[29-Aug-24 04:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
😉


[29-Aug-24 04:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I must say this is beyond my understanding of the game


[29-Aug-24 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah my area calcs are broken for extracted stuff, like helium


[29-Aug-24 04:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
13.57 isn't that far off from where I was


[29-Aug-24 04:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I think the WEL is probably still a more area intensive cost than the DRS path


[29-Aug-24 04:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
actually, 13.57 is way worse, I'm at like 24


[29-Aug-24 04:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh right, it's not the filter, it's the sortn, and so it's kind of random since both produce 1 DRF

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Aug-24 04:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
it only resolves 1 row


[29-Aug-24 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm yeah this will take some work to fix my extractor issues


[29-Aug-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Tentatively the DRS-DRF probably takes less area than WEL-DRF. But I might buy AL and do it anyway to sidestep taht


[29-Aug-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
it uses 6 AL every 80m on Nike:

[29-Aug-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
And that's 9 WEL, lmao


[29-Aug-24 04:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
importing AL from CX shows a -1500/cycle


[29-Aug-24 04:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
But anyway, the BSC is really slow and you'd need a full base of pharma thingies


[29-Aug-24 04:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's at selling DRF back onto the CX


[29-Aug-24 04:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah sort of why I'm not enthusiastic about Drones, the chain is big and unbalanced and it doesn't seem to end up as good as IDC and EDC


[29-Aug-24 04:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
assuming base area equates directly to cost/value (without including those) these are the numbers I get


[29-Aug-24 05:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
so this is relating the value of an MM directly with base area. Consumables are not being accounted for as a variable here, hence why IDC might look a bit better than it is really


[29-Aug-24 05:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
but it shows all those drones still really suck


[29-Aug-24 05:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh wait, missing a few

[29-Aug-24 05:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
NV2 doesn't look that bad


[29-Aug-24 05:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the hilarity of CC costing 2781 base area-days to make a single CC


[29-Aug-24 05:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
that means basically 5.5 (500 area)bases have to run for an entire day to make 1 CC


[29-Aug-24 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
😆


[29-Aug-24 05:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
NV1 / NV2 looked okay for me before, but right now my tool doesn't like them at all


[29-Aug-24 05:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't want to include too many outside factors with pricing - so this says 1 base (with STO and CM, 393 area is basically 1 base) can get you 180k in profit per day


[29-Aug-24 05:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
really need to get consumables added in here, hmmmm


[29-Aug-24 05:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh sure, NV2s are a ton of SL time


[29-Aug-24 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
after accounting for consumables, LOG look a lot better

[29-Aug-24 05:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
also shows just how close IDC and EDC are


[29-Aug-24 05:31 PM] hernanduer#0000

surprised LCB takes over 2k BAd to produce a single product


[29-Aug-24 05:39 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m really curious is IDC are the best overall


[29-Aug-24 05:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
People complain about them being easy but they are just so good it’s hard to ignore


[29-Aug-24 05:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
not heaving any inputs is already the best by default


[29-Aug-24 05:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If it was only that, like as implied risk free way of making good money. 
But if it’s that good that you can’t really be doing better it’s hard to justify playing sub optimal


[29-Aug-24 05:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
everyone have their own opinion on that I would love to see ship parts being MM with same margins as IDC


[29-Aug-24 05:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
I want trade between players and not conveyer belt to money

💯 (2) 

[29-Aug-24 05:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
but that's just me


[29-Aug-24 06:27 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think IDC shouldnt be as profitable indeed. Nothing is gained by having that specific commodity as mm


[29-Aug-24 06:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, some of the other marketmakers could enable player to player trade. But not IDC and EDC


[29-Aug-24 06:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I lost power so I am without spreadsheets at the moment


[29-Aug-24 06:44 PM] marat_sh#0000

Hehehe


[29-Aug-24 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am a little surprised those non MM items are so bad


[29-Aug-24 06:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am surprised that ADR is not that bad as I thought it would


[29-Aug-24 07:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
In place of MM prices I just put corp prices or CX prices for some of them, but yeah it's really impressive how much IDC makes


[29-Aug-24 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
Reflects a bit on real life with how GDP really doesn't mean as much as you might think. An entire universe of IDC, EDC and SCI consumables would have an insane GDP, but it does nothing


[29-Aug-24 07:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
speaking of GDP... I wander what % IDC and EDC are currently sitting at... Is there a data for it?


[29-Aug-24 07:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Have you seen the monthly economic reports?


[29-Aug-24 07:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
They skip IDC and EDc but contain everything else. But if you look at currency growth, you can determine the amount of those two commodities since those are the only marketmakers anyone really uses.


[29-Aug-24 07:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was wondering why there are not there lol 😅


[29-Aug-24 07:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think they are fine with IDCs since old player represent central banks that print new money into circulation


[29-Aug-24 07:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
Probably it will be until they find a better solution


[29-Aug-24 07:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have come to notice certain older players only make IDC


[29-Aug-24 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I’m a little perplexed that low strife was advocating for such a small Nerf. Because it totally doesn’t change anything, and he was talking like that change was going to totally shift the marketmaker meta.

lol didnt expect to be in there


[29-Aug-24 07:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think 220-240 is one base worth


[29-Aug-24 07:39 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
yeah iv got jeetiyu coming online


[29-Aug-24 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah around that is one full base


[29-Aug-24 07:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's like 38-40 IDC per day


[29-Aug-24 07:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
with 5 experts and ANT electronics bonus


[29-Aug-24 07:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
Still that's some crazy numbers... 299 IDC


[29-Aug-24 07:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
What's the point of playing the game at that point... Blood got actual money cheats 😅


[29-Aug-24 07:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
good thing the OOG bank production is distributed among many players 😛


[29-Aug-24 07:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
is a server wipes are a thing in this game?


[29-Aug-24 07:46 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
you have to play for yourself, thats the nature of compounding growth


[29-Aug-24 07:46 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
you wont catch firefreak in the forseeable future


[29-Aug-24 07:47 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
but you can grow to become an actor on the galactic scale that is well within reach


[29-Aug-24 07:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am a simple man... My end game goal is to produce every item from 'manufacturing' category without touching other industries 😅


[29-Aug-24 08:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
The server will wipe when there's a reason to do it, shouldn't happen for quite some time yet


[29-Aug-24 08:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
so there was no server wipes before?


[29-Aug-24 08:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
There were some before, over 3 years ago I think


[29-Aug-24 08:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
I assume when major update happened but I would count it as no wipes

[30-Aug-24 09:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
so I adjusted my workforce costs to be CX prices, I also added in the repair costs which I neglected to do yesterday, and then I also forgot to modify those costs by the efficiency


[30-Aug-24 09:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
interestingly, adding in repair costs really lowered EDC but not IDC


[30-Aug-24 09:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
and now the "normal" materials make a lot more sense - they're pretty profitable and beat most other MMs, but not IDC and EDC


[30-Aug-24 09:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm gonna do two RATs, one where it's all FRM and the other all HYF

almost twice the area costs for the FRM based RATs


[30-Aug-24 10:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
while it only costs 3 more AIC/u to go the HYF route


[30-Aug-24 11:00 AM] allocater#0000
that's revenue or profit?


[30-Aug-24 11:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
All of that is theoretical profit, if you make the whole chain


[30-Aug-24 11:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
So it should be 612 profit/day for an IDC base per area used by that base


[30-Aug-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
Which is about 306k/d  (500 * 612)


[30-Aug-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
Archiel had 302k so I'd say we're really close


[30-Aug-24 11:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
Should probably be 475 since you can never get rid of the CM


[30-Aug-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
prunplanner is around 300-320 I think so it matches there


[30-Aug-24 01:05 PM] allocater#0000
a HCC base can now make 100k/day


[30-Aug-24 09:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
woah I just figured out about hiding columns

the price for HSE on he CX on ANT incread a lot. on moria it isn't much cheaper.
are there other CXs where you can get it cheaper?
would entering into HSE production be a sensible move?


[31-Aug-24 06:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
You can try CXM HSE command to look at all of them at once


[31-Aug-24 06:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a while I was buying TCS and making it, if you only need a few dozen that works pretty well


[31-Aug-24 06:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
The markup on that stage seems high


[31-Aug-24 07:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
How come Phobos as so little SCI?


[31-Aug-24 07:18 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Seems like a perfect IDC planet


[31-Aug-24 07:18 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But they are all in MOR it seems


[31-Aug-24 08:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think they’re way more expensive to maintain with a relatively large PIO population like Phobos has


[31-Aug-24 08:23 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ah I see


[31-Aug-24 08:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not that Rise doesn’t have enough of a tax surplus to pay for it 😉


[01-Sep-24 03:08 AM] akyantor#0000
I was actually planning of making some HSE once I've finished my AWH plan, as it'd be easy to scale up making TCS as I'm already making TC for TK.

[01-Sep-24 05:02 AM] allocater#0000
I someone wants to build IDC bases on phobos, we can offer the same conditions as on Malahat.


[01-Sep-24 05:03 AM] allocater#0000
added bonus we create lack of SCI and can annoy Rise with it 😄


[01-Sep-24 07:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Oh man... I have a spare permit... even with my current plans. It's tempting as the extra income would be helpful.


[01-Sep-24 07:50 AM] akyantor#0000
There aren't actually enough SCI for a full permit of IDC at the moment, short by 150 SCI. :S


[01-Sep-24 07:50 AM] akyantor#0000
So it wouldn't be very efficient until that was fixed by the governor.


[01-Sep-24 07:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am making an IDC base on Jeetiyu, because they insist they can run them with very low taxes 😛

[01-Sep-24 08:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
for full effect we'd need to build them all at the same time 😆  just kidding


[01-Sep-24 08:44 AM] allocater#0000
the unemployment rate is always from last week, so there are 3,6% plus the new 109 SCI now.


[01-Sep-24 10:34 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If you want to annoy someone, XG-751b apparently as a bug where any time there is a lack of SCI, they are taken from MemoryAlpha’s idc base

[01-Sep-24 11:28 AM] akyantor#0000
Well, if the bank will fund it, I'm game to host another sponsored IDC base on Phobos for a while. It'd help me pay back the OOG bank loan, as well as helping me get over the expensive hump of the AWH plan (which is about to start as I need to build the AML/ASM soon).


[02-Sep-24 03:45 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Getting a new permit tomorrow. Also switched Elon from POL to LAB. Will make a POL base on YK-024a


[03-Sep-24 12:38 PM] allocater#0000
request the mats via contract or the LM. list is pinned in Malahat chat


[03-Sep-24 01:20 PM] akyantor#0000
Cool. I’ve posted the orders on the local market


[04-Sep-24 01:33 PM] archielvahr#0000

When do the changes take effect?


[04-Sep-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000

[04-Sep-24 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah probably overnight, so like 12-16 hours? not sure. Traditionally it's when I'm asleep


[04-Sep-24 03:02 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Made a POL base on YK-024a


[04-Sep-24 03:14 PM] akyantor#0000
@allocater just as a heads up I only have 3 warehouse on Phobos not the 4 in the instructions due to the limitation of the warehouse availability.

[05-Sep-24 12:12 AM] allocater#0000
then I try to deliver CM mats first


[05-Sep-24 10:54 AM] allocater#0000
so did anybody set at the MM price before the MM was changed? Which order is first?


[05-Sep-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yes you can beat the MM


[05-Sep-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000

can you build the CM and shift goods around to make space for the 240 RSE?


[05-Sep-24 03:09 PM] akyantor#0000
I realised I didn't sent a contract for the 4 LSE, so can't create the base. :S

{Reactions}
😮 

[05-Sep-24 03:09 PM] akyantor#0000
I've sent a contract for the missing contract I should have setup for 4 LSE.


[05-Sep-24 03:11 PM] akyantor#0000
Base built, should be able to fulfil the remaining contractws


[05-Sep-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
@allocater I can only draw down 19 SCI (1xSL), so will need to wait 5.5 days until placing the remaining buildings down just before the next popr

So... if nothing else lfabs/rfabs/afab supplies are going to be in demand...


[09-Sep-24 10:11 AM] akyantor#0000
There are least a handful of new goods in there... SST, TRS, GWS, and SPT


[09-Sep-24 10:14 AM] akyantor#0000
There could also be a clue in the expected range too (linking radius) default is 10...


[09-Sep-24 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
TWELVE HUNDRED TSH


[09-Sep-24 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh my


[09-Sep-24 10:17 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, if it stays like this they will be a monstrous material sink!


[09-Sep-24 10:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
600 RSH


[09-Sep-24 10:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
someone spin up the AMLs


[09-Sep-24 10:17 AM] akyantor#0000
And we don't even know how complicated some of those new goods are yet


[09-Sep-24 10:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's like the equivalent of an HQ level 28 upgrade


[09-Sep-24 10:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess it's calibrated to ensure that it'll mostly be a team sport


[09-Sep-24 10:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
and you have to have a couple distance upgrades for it to make sense


[09-Sep-24 10:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, we'll see if they adjust it at all


[09-Sep-24 10:24 AM] akyantor#0000
No doubt not final, will have to wait for some of this to appear on the test server to know for sure.


[09-Sep-24 10:24 AM] akyantor#0000

` that the gateway could potentially be connected to a gateway in one of these systems.`


[09-Sep-24 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
qualifying that you will need a gateway on both sides


[09-Sep-24 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
question is if both need the upgrade though


[09-Sep-24 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000

[09-Sep-24 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I like the mat breakdown a lot. A little something for everyone in there. It's not just afabs, it's the earlier ones too.  Plus the weird ones like LIT


[09-Sep-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
plus we still don't know the fuel


[09-Sep-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
or how that even works - why does the fuel tank matter


[09-Sep-24 11:05 AM] akyantor#0000
A potential side effect of all the weird stuff like PSH/RSH/TSH is that it'll may become cheaper to settle on more red planets...once everyone ramps up production for make gateways.


[09-Sep-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
PSH and RSH aren't even used I think


[09-Sep-24 11:05 AM] akyantor#0000
So just TSH, ah well


[09-Sep-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
TSH are already pretty cheap, the margin vs afabs is bad seeing as they just both use pp4s


[09-Sep-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
TSH I got 26 profit per minute


[09-Sep-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's lower than every other PP4 output except RSH (which is -6 profit per minute, lol)


[09-Sep-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
ADE is 128 profit per minute


[09-Sep-24 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
I bet CU demand is gonna go way up for SP. I wonder if it’s worth making my own


[09-Sep-24 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000

not quite as bad as gold, but it's needed in higher quanities


[09-Sep-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh the video Molp shared does have some range information in it as well. And upgrade costs for gateways. With two radius upgrades we're at 20 parsecs.

[09-Sep-24 04:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
> Ships take time to travel through a gateway, balanced to be similar to an FTL jump.


[09-Sep-24 04:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
what does it mean?


[09-Sep-24 04:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
Can you use Gates for In system transportation? gate of one planet to gate of another planet


[09-Sep-24 04:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
Like having Phobos - > Eos (from phobos closer to CX) as an example


[09-Sep-24 04:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
Usually large chunk of travel is taken by in system flight


[09-Sep-24 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Gate travel is between systems, but it isn’t instant. Just like each jump takes an hour or whatever, so does using a gateway


[09-Sep-24 04:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nothing within a system that we know about.


[09-Sep-24 05:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've just assumed that there would be in system gates since it's a planet project and not a system project

[10-Sep-24 07:52 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
It nice, appropriately expensive


[10-Sep-24 07:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
Also the GWS are 5000t/5000m


[10-Sep-24 07:53 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
And the amounts needed aren’t just a factor of cash, getting a hand on them is itself a lot


[10-Sep-24 07:53 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Oh so they need to be built in place?


[10-Sep-24 07:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
Unless they add a ship that can carry that much, I guess so


[10-Sep-24 07:53 AM] melon164#0000
Oh that's clever


[10-Sep-24 07:54 AM] melon164#0000
So if we want to build a gate at Demeter, we need to maintain SCI _on Demeter_ 🤯


[10-Sep-24 07:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’m just happy they’re appropriately difficult and expensive to make 😄

[10-Sep-24 07:55 AM] melon164#0000
@akyantor (or anyone else with test server access) could you screenshot the other gateway component recipes?

not necessarily, just the ENG really


[10-Sep-24 08:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
Looks like a bug in my opinion


[10-Sep-24 08:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
I don't think they will go that route


[10-Sep-24 08:19 AM] marat_sh#0000
It would be cool for on site production (also makes sense) but It might be just some was happy pressing extra 0


[10-Sep-24 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
nah look at the sizes of the components before


[10-Sep-24 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
it builds up to being that big


[10-Sep-24 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
SST is 1500/500


[10-Sep-24 08:23 AM] hernanduer#0000

Screenshot at 1,1,1,1 and 2,2,2,2 for example


[10-Sep-24 09:04 AM] hernanduer#0000

distance and volume max at 3 upgrades


[10-Sep-24 09:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
capacity goes to 5


[10-Sep-24 09:07 AM] marat_sh#0000
if distance is 0 for same system... Can you do in system gate?


[10-Sep-24 09:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
Demeter cannot make the jump across the gap with 3 distance upgrades :'(((((


[10-Sep-24 09:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
or is just 1 planet -> other system


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
it doesn't show paths


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
it just gives you possible systems


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] mrsmith33#0000
eh, similar to experts limit


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
so endpoints are systems, not planets


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
right now at least


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
farthest that Antares can reach is WU-504


[10-Sep-24 09:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
Antares cannot reach Demeter


[10-Sep-24 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
Antares also can't reach any other CXs 🤔


[10-Sep-24 09:10 AM] katinga#0000

[10-Sep-24 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
WU-504 still can't reach OS-099 either


[10-Sep-24 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
so it'd be a minimum of 2 hops

So much for a bridge from ANT to WU-070a (Hyalos)


[10-Sep-24 09:21 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess it may be that it makes sense to build some gateways to useful junction points that enable access to more that one location, where you can't go direct


[10-Sep-24 09:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Interestingly... doesn't look like you can just max everything... may be limits on how many upgrades you can do (trading off range for volume/capacity).

geez RHO is heavy, I wonder if they're gonna change that


[10-Sep-24 10:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
an absolute smelt-on-site ore, since the RHE is like a quarter the mass


[10-Sep-24 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh interesting


[10-Sep-24 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
The way more ore is supposed to be imo 😛


[10-Sep-24 10:01 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah but then you should have slag


[10-Sep-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
just melt the slag into LST or something 😄


[10-Sep-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
or carbon


[10-Sep-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
you should probably start up that BTS tap again


[10-Sep-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
sounds like W is gonna be in big boy demand soon


[10-Sep-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
could sell it for a bit more if you wanna


[10-Sep-24 10:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
or I could go make a base on XD-311b


[10-Sep-24 10:12 AM] archielvahr#0000

Akyan added a BTS tap I believe, he could expand that

Wow, gateway fuel comes via EEP?!


[10-Sep-24 11:19 AM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Sep-24 11:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
I wonder what the price would be for that fuel... and how much it uses


[10-Sep-24 11:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
1 EEP run makes 4k fuel, and max capacity on a gate is 2500, so I don't know how much is gonna be needed


[10-Sep-24 11:28 AM] allocater#0000
gateways might be a trap that will take years to recoup the investment 🤔


[10-Sep-24 11:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
now that we know the breakdown of the new components, let me put together the new BOM and we'll see


[10-Sep-24 11:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think well north of 200mil


[10-Sep-24 11:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[10-Sep-24 11:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
282mil


[10-Sep-24 11:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
I didn't include labor costs in any of the new components either


[10-Sep-24 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
and they're all in expensive buildings, so that's easily several more millions


[10-Sep-24 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
I updated it to include 3 distance upgrades, so the Afabs could be a lot lower if you didn't need those


[10-Sep-24 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
but it looks like without a distance upgrade it's almost useless


[10-Sep-24 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
oh and the yellow are guess, Rhenium looks about the same as FE and AL so I just guessed it'll be the same cost


[10-Sep-24 11:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
At 200 jumps a day max, how much do you charge to recoup 282mil in say a year? Say 50k jumps in a year, and fuel is half the cost, you'd only have to charge about 7500 per jump

{Reactions}
🥲 

[10-Sep-24 11:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
since it's planetary investment They shouldn't care about ROI


[10-Sep-24 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it’s gotta be max distance to make sense. Maybe some exceptions exist.


[10-Sep-24 11:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
No planet has this much money, haha


[10-Sep-24 11:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's gonna be groups of people like us, and we'll want reimbursements


[10-Sep-24 11:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
it doesn't have to be build instantly for a full price 😅


[10-Sep-24 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah but we are talking about a lot of labor for sureeee


[10-Sep-24 11:58 AM] marat_sh#0000
I assume phobos is the planet with highest income right?


[10-Sep-24 11:58 AM] marat_sh#0000
how much is it?


[10-Sep-24 12:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
Last time rise said it's 10mil a month


[10-Sep-24 12:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
so around ~2.5 years for one gate


[10-Sep-24 12:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well it's 100% gonna be on players donations


[10-Sep-24 12:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
and donations shouldn't have ROI ether 😅 If I gave a bread to an orphan I don't expect that orphan by my products in 2 years 😅


[10-Sep-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
donations on the magnitude of 10k-100k, whatever


[10-Sep-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Sep-24 12:39 PM] akyantor#0000
On cost how do you guarantee the payback for the corp responsible for the build. You’d only want to take it on for a planet you have a complete lock on.


[10-Sep-24 12:39 PM] akyantor#0000
Like #project-6115


[10-Sep-24 12:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
There is also a increase in capacity that is an indirect return


[10-Sep-24 12:40 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Being able to run more ships quicker


[10-Sep-24 12:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said, you’d need to have them lock to a corp for a real reason to have them


[10-Sep-24 12:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can see a corp have a network and selling access to other corps


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Its also at the same time gives more of a reason for being to corps


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] akyantor#0000
Do you end up building them on dead planets where there’s no reason to have a base solely so they can be controlled by a corp? As you can use permits to control the planet


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] akyantor#0000
As there’s little incentive to build a permit there otherwise


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think we are going to see a lot of movement in galactic politics and the likes


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
A lot more base sponsoring


[10-Sep-24 12:42 PM] akyantor#0000
You could end up with some really weird emergent behaviour between the politics expansion and this


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
A lot more corp activity as well


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] akyantor#0000
To create defacto corp controlled planets


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Would be interesting


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] akyantor#0000
Which in turn control gateways


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Or vote buying if being governor is more important


[10-Sep-24 12:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can see control of the gate end point being very contentious


[10-Sep-24 12:44 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
It also very much shakes up ship construction and the corp efforts behind that


[10-Sep-24 12:45 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im happy they are that expensive


[10-Sep-24 12:48 PM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Sep-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Haven’t thought of anything concrete yet, but is there any interest in starting a project in-corp to make some of the materials for the gateway? I’m guessing the TSH and Afabs are going to be major bottlenecks


[10-Sep-24 02:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
So it could maybe be worthwhile to focus on one as a group


[10-Sep-24 02:14 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If any corp is big enough it should be us


[10-Sep-24 02:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I was already planning an A fab production, I can dedicate some permits to that


[10-Sep-24 02:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But I can’t really start for a few weeks as I’ll be going on vacation and won’t be there to get it running


[10-Sep-24 02:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just curious on people’s thoughts 🙂


[10-Sep-24 02:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
I figure as a group we’re more limited by permits than anything else


[10-Sep-24 02:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
But that could also be a good reason to make Afabs as a group. Just a thought 😁

I don’t think the fab are going to be the limiter


[10-Sep-24 02:19 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That can be solved with money


[10-Sep-24 02:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The challenge is what money alone can’t juy


[10-Sep-24 02:21 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably be game to support. Would only be able to help in a month or so though, need to finish my current plan and pay back my loans. 😛


[10-Sep-24 02:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
KRE through EEPs, perhaps?


[10-Sep-24 02:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I didn’t analyse stuff sufficiently


[10-Sep-24 02:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Me neither, yet - I’m still stuck at work 😄


[10-Sep-24 02:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’m « at work »


[10-Sep-24 02:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Am I working?


[10-Sep-24 02:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
If I ever branch out of Manufacturing I can go for electronics (CLR and ECA)


[10-Sep-24 02:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Phobos beckons 😁


[10-Sep-24 02:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Plus, electronics is basically manufacturing, but for really small things

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Sep-24 02:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
I will run some numbers


[10-Sep-24 02:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
PPF base will have to wait


[10-Sep-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I definitely agree


[10-Sep-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly just because it would be fun


[10-Sep-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I brought it up in ADI Coordinators chat, no one really jumped on any of the planning aspects


[10-Sep-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like Shrewd said, a lot of those products aren't on the market at any price


[10-Sep-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wanted to get other opinions about the route. I think Antares should start with a pair of gateways before adding a 3rd or 4th. Production time itself is gonna be long, and split efforts will delay completion of a pair.


[10-Sep-24 02:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah - before the politics update, it felt like governance was our big purpose, but now there’s not nearly as much reason to focus on that as a corp, so doing something else together could be fun 🙂


[10-Sep-24 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I was just talking to JeanPaulMarat about that too.


[10-Sep-24 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that mean:
* Deciding a route
* Deciding if a single corp (us) bankrolls it, and tries to make the money back via fees
* * Or it's just a big donation party
* * And other people in ANT hopefully donate too


[10-Sep-24 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since there's two gateways, that could work. We'd have to be damn sure we can hold the p lanet we build it around, if we hope to make back fees in any meaningful way though.


[10-Sep-24 02:39 PM] akyantor#0000
I think that's where placing it around an inner planet that's currently unutilised could be a strategy... won't be a natural base of permit holders to vote for governance other than our own.


[10-Sep-24 02:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
As much as I’d love to make the G in OOG stand for gateway, I don’t think the ROI is there for bankrolling it


[10-Sep-24 02:39 PM] akyantor#0000
It's a big sacrafic though to go that route


[10-Sep-24 02:40 PM] akyantor#0000
I think realistically it's at least in part going to be a subsidised effort, with only partial payback at best.


[10-Sep-24 02:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. The construction itself might be a sunk cost


[10-Sep-24 02:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
The fuel though - consumed every jump, using high-tier buildings?


[10-Sep-24 02:41 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that'd need to be funded by use


[10-Sep-24 02:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
There could be some consistent profit there too if we make / sell the fuel


[10-Sep-24 02:42 PM] akyantor#0000
Agreed.


[10-Sep-24 02:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
But I suppose that depends on how much is used


[10-Sep-24 02:42 PM] akyantor#0000
The route selection will be cruical


[10-Sep-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
depending on time savings and fuel savings, I don't think it's infeasible we recoup


[10-Sep-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
it'd be a long long term recoup though


[10-Sep-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
charging 10-15k a jump, but saving that much in fuel, not to mention time? Would be very enticing


[10-Sep-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
with current distances, easy choice is Heph to Griff


[10-Sep-24 02:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
takes JUST over 1 distance upgrade, so we'll need 2


[10-Sep-24 02:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
you need the traffic to justify the payback period as well


[10-Sep-24 02:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
And I think Chem products are more used in the manufacturing rather than electronics? Anyone else feel free to butt in 🙂


[10-Sep-24 02:48 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, a strong option


[10-Sep-24 02:50 PM] akyantor#0000
Norwick is possibly interesting, short cut to return food products to ant (fairly high pop)?


[10-Sep-24 02:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh yeah, good point - not to mention that you could potentially fly from ANT to Heph and take the gate to griff (sorry, that was supposed to be a reply)


[10-Sep-24 02:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
Nascent to Demeter can be done with 3 upgrades

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Sep-24 02:51 PM] akyantor#0000
Heph<->Griffonstone is pretty strong


[10-Sep-24 02:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
Elon to Demeter with 2


[10-Sep-24 02:51 PM] akyantor#0000
That's a pretty strong...


[10-Sep-24 02:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I know that C + Ag pairing, yeah


[10-Sep-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ant I to Norwick can be done with 1 distance upgrade


[10-Sep-24 02:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
Halcyon to Griff is also 1 distance


[10-Sep-24 02:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think the only meaningful impact of a gate would be if it opens up new planets


[10-Sep-24 02:54 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If it allows to go to a new region then we have side benefits as well


[10-Sep-24 02:54 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
In that we would have a better access to new good planets


[10-Sep-24 02:55 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can see the benefits in that case, particularly if we try to lock down those sorrounding planets as well


[10-Sep-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
in that vein... a gateway from YK-024 to Arclight can be made with 3 distance


[10-Sep-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
unfortunately connecting to OS-099 is gonna take at least 3 sets of gateways...


[10-Sep-24 02:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I wonder how much we could shorten the trip with just one gateway


[10-Sep-24 02:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im thinking we would need to see where will the new resources be


[10-Sep-24 02:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Might be a case of we need to move there first in order to then connect it


[10-Sep-24 02:58 PM] akyantor#0000
WU-070 to GM-something?


[10-Sep-24 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
GM-498 to Hyalos can be done in 2 distance, that should cut at least 7 jumps


[10-Sep-24 02:59 PM] akyantor#0000
snap


[10-Sep-24 02:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
We can do the longer parsec jumps in FTL and batch up some of the shorter ones via gateways


[10-Sep-24 03:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
Hyalos to GM-212 cuts another 2 jumps for an extra distance upgrade


[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
so you can do Aceland -> Hyalos -> GM-212


[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
ANT can't reach WU-070a


[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
When the ressources come out, do we want to make sure we have ships ready to lock it down?

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
ANT can reach WU-504


[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think that should be our first step


[10-Sep-24 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000

Ship full for a base, the extractors, the ADM and the COGC


[10-Sep-24 03:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But it depends how much we want to be good guys versus trying to take a hold of ressources

about to start buying some supply to build a new base now 🙂 2nd one woot


[10-Sep-24 03:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's not like we'd prevent people from using the gates, we just want to make sure we get reimbursed


[10-Sep-24 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
2nd base is a big milestone 😄


[10-Sep-24 03:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm curious if he's going to put other features in to help ensure that


[10-Sep-24 03:03 PM] hernanduer#0000

i do not mind


[10-Sep-24 03:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
WU-504 can reach both Ant and GM-498


[10-Sep-24 03:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
then GM-498 can reach OS-099


[10-Sep-24 03:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
but if they're permanently paired (which is still unclear) then that's 3 sets of gates 😴


[10-Sep-24 03:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
if it's just one gate that can be redirected though, it's only 4 gates


[10-Sep-24 03:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
I really hope it's the latter


[10-Sep-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
These are <= 25 parsecs. Not sure if EW-238 has more auxilary uses than WU-504.

EW-238c has a half decent HAL point, like 20th in universe or something


[10-Sep-24 03:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
and it's SEA only


[10-Sep-24 03:09 PM] xtc69#0000
i will for sure should be up and running tomorrow i hope trying to see how much i need


[10-Sep-24 03:09 PM] xtc69#0000
yeah going to read website agian


[10-Sep-24 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
We could also work out a regional cooperative for the gateway ownership, recover a portion of the shares proportional to the contributions. Having more people onboard for the cooperative would ensure the planet keeps ownership

You can do /project but it's a little more effort, since you have to format a string sort of specifically.


[10-Sep-24 04:54 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
is there a guide for the syntax of a /project somewhere?

[11-Sep-24 02:52 AM] melon164#0000
In terms of construction, I bet it'll be the "little" things (for some quite impressive definition of 'little') that get us, like the way it sneakily needs six _thousand_ KV 😮


[11-Sep-24 03:14 AM] akyantor#0000
Ergh, KV is painfully slow / space intensive. *Having just learned this as I'm preparing to make TK*.

is anybody making moves toward servicing the new gateway economy? I only switched ECA to SP for now, since lowstrife is paying 2.6k


[15-Sep-24 10:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have been saving my CBL instead of selling it.


[15-Sep-24 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
We could start on MTC now. No one has started and we're gonna need 300 MTC per gateway. They actually take a fair bit of production time.

I don't have a clothing factory to make SPT, but I've got a stockpile of KV. I can probably get ready to start knocking out PFGs pretty quick


[15-Sep-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have s growing amount of KV


[15-Sep-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
Over 400 right now


[15-Sep-24 10:58 AM] allocater#0000
Am I seeing this right, a APF base now makes 400k/day with LOG?


[15-Sep-24 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I  have it as $139,937.9 per 500 area at 176% efficiency for each step, assuming you make the whole thing


[15-Sep-24 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Or another sheet puts it at 151k per 500 area per day

ok it was counting BMF at 19000


[15-Sep-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
How does it look at 24k?


[15-Sep-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it would be correct assuming you can actually get those things at those prices, but if you need a low income BMF base, or the LD/SAL prices are too low, it will pull the average down


[15-Sep-24 11:22 AM] allocater#0000
341k, comparable with IDC base


[15-Sep-24 11:23 AM] allocater#0000
but even the BMF base makes 263k


[15-Sep-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm that's not bad


[15-Sep-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the poor numbers I'm getting come from the DCL and MB going into the BMF

Fixed the math on the area calcs in my tool


[15-Sep-24 11:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently DCL is coming up basically at a loss (probably because it's so easy to make if you are already making PSL in the same building


[15-Sep-24 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
That is a downside of tools like this one, esp extractor-y stuff


[15-Sep-24 11:38 AM] allocater#0000
well, as long as I can get the input for this cheap, I will go for it. It sets a new bottom on all APF products.


[15-Sep-24 03:18 PM] melon164#0000
I’ve made moves to make RSH, more HSE and more KV.

damn autocorrect 🤦‍♂️


[16-Sep-24 07:13 AM] melon164#0000
🤔 my calculations are that a gateway needs 6k SPT, which is 600 MTC?  And that that's about 4-5d of a CLR base.  Doesn't feel extreme to me...


[16-Sep-24 07:52 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have CLR base. Can make MTC if needed


[16-Sep-24 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm yeah I saw 2 MTC in 9 hours


[16-Sep-24 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
But I guess it goes fast when you have a bunch. I started some here:

so what is the bottleneck production for a gateway?


[16-Sep-24 12:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
let me employ the power of the base area calculator to determine what's truly the most expensive

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Sep-24 01:26 PM] melon164#0000
Rhenium will probably bottleneck at first just because it’s new and needs to be spun up all the way from colonisation. Equally a lot of AAF time, although that’s a lot faster to spin up, _except_ if AAF-GWS has to be done on site, in which case we’ll need ENG/SCI in odd places


[16-Sep-24 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
the bill of materials for a GWS is 131 items long

[16-Sep-24 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
yellow column is number of base area days - so if you have a 112k area base, you can make 4 GWS in 1 day 😄


[16-Sep-24 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
and since these are static values, here's the list for comparison

[16-Sep-24 02:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
those are using the real time equations on the staging server


[16-Sep-24 02:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
so it's as accurate as I can get it right now


[16-Sep-24 02:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
looks like the SP and TSH are gonna be the main holdups


[16-Sep-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is it overestimating the EXT time for the SP mats? Seems pretty high. But that's just me eyeballin' it


[16-Sep-24 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
the $ to area ratio is awful on SPs


[16-Sep-24 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
but maybe that checks out 😆


[16-Sep-24 02:30 PM] melon164#0000
So each item is the cumulative BaD to produce it and its inputs?


[16-Sep-24 02:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
Right


[16-Sep-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
Maybe, all the EXTs are assuming 10 ore per 10 hours


[16-Sep-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
For AL and FE that's pretty low, but for others it's a little high


[16-Sep-24 02:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
You can see for most of them cost aligns with BAd, which is expected. SP is kind of an outlier. The cost is calculated completely independent of BAd so I think that's a good validation


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I added a sheet to your thing with some numbers:


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
TEMPORARY EXT NUMBERS


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those are the average concentration


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
lemme add max


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
numbers are extracted per day


[16-Sep-24 02:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I dunno if you care to change them, but there they are 😉


[16-Sep-24 02:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
Maybe 10% below max, and modify it to per 10 hours? Then just update the Outputs sheet at the very bottom


[16-Sep-24 02:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm at work now and my poor phone can't process those calculations lol


[16-Sep-24 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay I added average and max, because it was easy to calculate. I think I can mix those to get a 90th percentile reasonably.


[16-Sep-24 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
👍


[16-Sep-24 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got it in there


[16-Sep-24 02:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
"RIG:=>20xH2O" noticed that's 20 and some of the other ones are 10, I am ignoring that though


[16-Sep-24 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
added to the "Base Area Day" sheet


[16-Sep-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is maybe not what you are working in for the gateways


[16-Sep-24 04:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
Nah I think that's in my personal sheet, I'll have to update them when I get home


[16-Sep-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can also make a fun sheet that totals all the mats needed as dependencies


[16-Sep-24 04:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
If we wanna see where the hotspots are


[16-Sep-24 09:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ooooookay so I adjusted some of the equations it was picking and that had pretty big consequences. I'll post the new one in a few, as well as a complete material breakdown

[16-Sep-24 10:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay, so that's the updated chart


[16-Sep-24 10:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
and here's a new one: total number of materials needed, and then the colors are a scale of how long it'll take to make *just that stage* of the material


[16-Sep-24 10:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
so for example, the AL time is just the time spent in SMEs


[16-Sep-24 10:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
specifically this recipe SME:6xALO-1xC-1xFLX-1xO=>4xAL


[16-Sep-24 10:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
so now we can see exactly where time needs to be spent making material parts


[16-Sep-24 10:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
MAI is high use because the C recipe in use is INC:4xHCP-2xMAI=>4xC

[16-Sep-24 10:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
Took a few tries 😅


[16-Sep-24 10:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
Kinda interesting - based off the 2024-08 economic report, the galaxy makes 38,834 ALO per day. Assuming everyone uses the FLX recipe, that's about exactly 26k AL per day. So one gateway uses just a touch more than 1 day worth of the galaxy's AL


[16-Sep-24 10:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
Those times are 100% efficiency


[16-Sep-24 10:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
That is interesting, it's a lot of metal


[16-Sep-24 10:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
Carbon is similar too. 35k per day vs 30.5k for a gateway


[16-Sep-24 10:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
I want to sit down and put those all in a sheet so we can see what basic materials might be most in shortage (at least compared to the galactic GDP, like a % of galaxy production per day / week metric)


[16-Sep-24 10:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
though I'm guessing it'll line up pretty much 1:1 with the materials with the longest stage time in your sheet, so it might be redundant 😄


[16-Sep-24 10:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
For the more common stuff yeah but PSH and RSH you'd probably find the galactic production at 0 hah


[16-Sep-24 10:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
AML products will probably be off too


[16-Sep-24 10:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, those might be things to check against LEAD for the last month


[16-Sep-24 10:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
RHO and RHE are also rather low time wise


[16-Sep-24 10:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
Considering they're whole new materials


[16-Sep-24 10:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
ALR and WRH are related as well

HCP + MAI makes the most sense to me

nope, HCP+MAI is better for base area

good catch, that's what I actually did want to check... still looks slightly inferior to HCP + MAI

if your GRN is from Promitor with the extra fertility %, it could just about even out

If they are paired, can the destination gateway be changed? How often?   Gateway destinations can be changed anytime (only via motions for now).  Can one gateway re...

[18-Sep-24 07:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
These answers do  say  1:1 symmetric links. No shared gateways receiving ships from multiple gateways


[18-Sep-24 08:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
Think they might need to back off on the cost then


[18-Sep-24 08:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
Or make them corporate owned, it's hard to trust any faction space planet


[18-Sep-24 10:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
I really don't like that the pairs are locked in


[18-Sep-24 10:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
I posted this in the behind the scenes channel:
"so with some of those answers, I'm extremely concerned to run these gates in faction space while they're owned by a government 
if someone funds a gate-pair and then some other force builds a single gate at a different destination, there can be constant conflict trying to get the gate changed
and I don't like having roughly 300mil in "constant conflict" for no reason
governments are basically unaccountable, if they owe a debt there's absolutely zero guarantee it'll be paid. I think I'd wait for gateways to be ownable by corporations to do anything"


[18-Sep-24 10:33 AM] allocater#0000
followup: what if A<->B are linked and then Planet A motions to change to C. Will B just seize operations?


[18-Sep-24 10:34 AM] allocater#0000
can you do 24 change motions per day, so every hour the gateway connects to a different system?


[18-Sep-24 10:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah B would just be useless

Well regarding the gateway discussion in https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1283881894966202469 I am inclined to go grab planet A in LS-231a and lock it down


[18-Sep-24 11:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also in that system: Aratora is too large to lock down.


[18-Sep-24 11:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
LS-231c is an option, it already has ADMs and such, but it has a few people on it who mostly ignore it.


[18-Sep-24 11:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
PiBoy is the current governor but might be inclined to join up


[18-Sep-24 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have a spare permit after closing down my ill-fated HEX tap 😆


[18-Sep-24 11:47 AM] max.kalina#0000
I was thinking about LST base on Aratora😎  instead Nike


[18-Sep-24 11:47 AM] max.kalina#0000
Lock down, you mean make planet exclusive for corp members?


[18-Sep-24 11:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, put on a base establishment fee so we can control it better, and potentially build gateways in orbit

[18-Sep-24 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
that one?


[18-Sep-24 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I like it as a whole, but ANT <-> IA-603 is useless in and of itself


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Compare it to the the LS-231 plan, which gets you to griff and etherwind, when you just have two gateways.   I don't really have a sense of how quickly two gateways will come together, let alone 10 gateways.. so we should make the first pair really count, if possible


[18-Sep-24 01:31 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yah that a 3 billion plan


[18-Sep-24 01:31 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But it’s a nice community challenge


[18-Sep-24 01:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
do people even have that much capital?


[18-Sep-24 01:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
3b is a lot. It's high enough that I think you can't really look at it as capital, but rather.. does the universe actually make enough of those resources to supply it?


[18-Sep-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
With those upgrades it's probably closer to 5.6 billion


[18-Sep-24 01:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
one thing to make it Other is to buy it


[18-Sep-24 01:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't think people will sell items at the cost to make


[18-Sep-24 02:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Yeah at this point the constraint is production


[18-Sep-24 02:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
global production is also drastically higher than global cx sales, so even if you had the money you couldn't buy 10% of it on the CX anyway


[18-Sep-24 03:17 PM] allocater#0000
BEN will also want to connect to Moria, instead of ANT, so might be a while until BEN gets a second gateway for ANT


[18-Sep-24 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Does anyone know about other regions gateway efforts?


[18-Sep-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Haven’t heard anything


[18-Sep-24 03:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Mor region feels pretty dead on the UFO


[18-Sep-24 03:38 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Feels like all the other big corps have desintegrated


[18-Sep-24 04:27 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That does seem kind of ridiculous.  It would make a gateway at Phobos basically useless


[18-Sep-24 05:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
They'll need a hop in the middle, would be good if we convince them of some sort of axis


[18-Sep-24 08:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I hear a vague plan of Etherwind to Katoa by Kawa


[20-Sep-24 08:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
Roh talks too much in the ADI gateway chat


[20-Sep-24 08:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
Seems it's the only place to talk about gateways though, that's concerning maybe... Or the devs will recognize there is little benefit when owned by governments.


[20-Sep-24 08:59 AM] hernanduer#0000

Yeah some old message board formatting


[20-Sep-24 10:04 AM] akyantor#0000

I don't think he's ill intended as far as I can tell, just difficult.


[20-Sep-24 10:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
His use of commas, every other word, makes it really hard, to get a flow for, his sentences


[20-Sep-24 10:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t know, when to properly use, commas in sentences, but this, can’t be right


[20-Sep-24 10:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
Lol yeah I'm sure I use them wrong too, but at least they're not so frequent. I'm not a fan of blocking people who aren't malignant, I just avoid his text for sanity haha


[20-Sep-24 10:24 AM] akyantor#0000
To the earlier point, I'd agree... I feel like it may be a bit of an error to have gateways initially controlled by planets rather than corps.


[20-Sep-24 10:25 AM] akyantor#0000
It's definitely going to put some folks off having it connected with politics. If they'd gone the corp route it could have been a good way to create a purpose for corps again now that there's no connection with planetary dividends.


[20-Sep-24 10:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I mean we can always stockpile the ressources until corp ownership is out


[20-Sep-24 10:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Not like we are going to pump out gates within the first weeks/month


[20-Sep-24 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
usually when the devs say "not planned for the current release", they mean it's yeaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrs away


[20-Sep-24 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
like changing currencies for a planet via a government motion, it wasn't ever gonna be done right after the politics release


[20-Sep-24 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
likewise with the multi-item contracts which were "coming in a future release" when private contracts were added like 2 years ago


[20-Sep-24 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think those items basically go to the back of the list, so they might even be after the power/electricity update


[20-Sep-24 10:42 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Fair enough, I guess you are well placed to know


[20-Sep-24 10:43 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I m sure they have there reasons but sometimes I’m puzzled by the game devs priorities


[20-Sep-24 10:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Like language localization is a lot of energy for not that much return


[20-Sep-24 10:45 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Maybe I underestimate the complexity but there would be so many QOL low hanging fruits


[20-Sep-24 10:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am pretty sure it was their high priority to make game in german for grant and now since german is a thing They thought might as well translate whole game


[20-Sep-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah there are some oddities with their dev process


[20-Sep-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep the translation parts were a requirement from the grant.


[20-Sep-24 10:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
And the community translation stuff these last weeks overlaps with stuff they've built for their other game


[20-Sep-24 10:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
They sort of avoid touching anything that PMMG or FIO might cover, which sort of makes sense in some ways, even though it seems like pretty low hanging fruit to replicate some of those ideas


[20-Sep-24 10:49 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Translation gives access to more players -> more moneys


[20-Sep-24 10:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
Paradox does the same They see that players fix their issues through mods and just focus on other stuff


[20-Sep-24 10:50 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Arguably spending that money on marketing would probably bring more players… 
But again not my industry so what do I know


[20-Sep-24 10:51 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Most people take a while to get the extension and likely leave the game before then


[20-Sep-24 10:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
Honestly They just Need english german and chinese for a game success


[20-Sep-24 10:52 AM] marat_sh#0000
I had 170h (3 weeks) on steam before transferred to browser


[20-Sep-24 10:53 AM] marat_sh#0000

[20-Sep-24 11:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
Also, out all of the things that they could be working Why Gates (why now)? I am not complaining since it will help with logistical problems people have, but really? Multi items in the contract I think would be on the top of the list if people could vote on features


[20-Sep-24 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I think they are pretty responsive on some things. I've been pushing the devs to try to do some of those QOL things, especially because click-burnout is a big thing, and i think it affects retention of paying players. I think the motion editor is better than the contract one. And they tried with the changes to "Select Template" which puts everything in one spot and doesn't have multiple "save" buttons

But it's another click to get in there and it's not really helpful, but it's the right idea 🤷‍♂️


[20-Sep-24 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
multi item contracts would be great, I think in their mind it mostly benefits big players like ship builders, and if you count all the trial users we're probably like 1% of the playerbase.. and we're gonna stick around anyway.


[20-Sep-24 11:05 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That a recurring contracts would really improve player to player deals


[20-Sep-24 11:05 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Would allow more supply deals


[20-Sep-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that "Recurring contract" button is like 4 years old 😄


[20-Sep-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000

I’ve got like 3-4 spare permits and only plans for 1 of them atm

[21-Sep-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
I was considering setting up a small amount of AUO mining on Elon and putting together a smelting / fine smelting base to free up space on Phobos


[21-Sep-24 11:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
So as to make some of the metals myself and sell the excess


[21-Sep-24 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that’s what got me thinking about it - seems like most people make some for shipbuilding but there’s few selling to market


[21-Sep-24 11:58 AM] mrsmith33#0000
There is AUO on ZV-194d. I smelt it there


[21-Sep-24 11:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 600+ AU on ANT if anyone needs


[21-Sep-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
Hmm. I’ll disappear to prunplanner for a few days and come back with a plan 😄


[21-Sep-24 12:06 PM] sidepipe#0000

[22-Sep-24 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
so what I tried to do is:


[22-Sep-24 05:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
given the static settings for ELP and MCA above, minimize the $ amount of stuff overproduced on the right (based on the PP30D prices for each)


[22-Sep-24 05:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
and limiting the maximum order length to 14 days for any given item, to make it a bit easier to bootstrap (previous solutions were coming up with like 1.5 month order times to shave off an extra .3 HD overproduced per day 😄 )


[22-Sep-24 06:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh yeah, and that all those intermediate products were produced at a surplus, but just keeping that surplus as small as possible with the price constraint


[22-Sep-24 07:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
so. I have 2 solutions that should work (I haven't tested the second one in prunplanner yet) - but important question: is 100 BWS a week way more than the market can handle?


[22-Sep-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
Right now I'm looking at making either 50 per week, which would take up half of two permits on OS-099c and d, or 100 per week to take up almost the whole lot. I guess the former leaves room for other electonics stuff if there's anything people are particularly interested in


[22-Sep-24 07:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
this is solution #2 btw. I think it should fit into two permits but I don't even wanna put it into prunplanner if 100 BWS per week seems like overkill 😄

Clearly what the universe needs is to quintuple the supply of WS 😝


[23-Sep-24 09:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
Well, you’ll need a lot of BWS to do that 😁


[23-Sep-24 09:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
Though this is definitely a solution in search of a problem, but I kinda wanna do it anyway. The top 10 players made 414 BWS this week so this is only another 25%


[23-Sep-24 09:50 AM] melon164#0000
Just don't go down the path of "well if I run out of inputs for the more complicated recipes, I can always make some SAR on the side" 🫠

Yeah, that’s why I’m just sticking with the BWS for now 😄


[23-Sep-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I think this is just crazy enough to work. If lowstrife can make this many for sale on the CX and they’re out of stock everywhere, then I think there’s enough room in the market for another player 🙂

I could switch the WPL base on Heph over to CLF if you want

Since you're renting it anyway - that way you can just stockpile at heph and we can get it running as soon as the update hits

They think you just quit the game


[25-Sep-24 01:23 PM] zipatsu#0000
Yeah 😄 Saw someone say that on the Boucher chat too, feel bad for the people that actually used it but I hope it at least sends a message to the people just buying it to resell that most of the water on the CX was shipped in by me so their buys likely aren't getting filled either at the moment

[25-Sep-24 02:35 PM] zipatsu#0000
Just recently put up a base on OF-208b but the cost for each new base has gotten pretty wild (*permits for the next base in screenshot, add +- a few million for the actual parts of the base and then a few more for the planets where I'll have to do the infrastructure too like JS-753b*), combined with me not looking for mega profit on the H2O it's a bit of a time period in-between upgrades. 's a fun process though! ✌️

[25-Sep-24 02:54 PM] zipatsu#0000
Started playing this game with a friend, we were planning on going for #1 Carbon suppliers but then at some point while growing HCP I veered off into the H2O business instead 😄 Was able to get a solid start thanks to Allocater buying all my Carbon and selling us cheap bfabs ✌️


[25-Sep-24 03:26 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i'm supporting a new player who grows HER on Harmonia. he just got a second base on SE-648 b.

still bought H2O from me. so i guess he's in the process of establishing his new base.

[26-Sep-24 09:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
(the extra MPC and RAM were an intentional compromise on my part to get 4 ELP making 100% BWS)


[28-Sep-24 11:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So for an ADI project (SKP) I am making a base with 6 AMLs, I *can* fit 3 more AMLs or some LABs. 

I don’t care either way which I build (AML or LAB) would there be a preference incorp for either’s products?


[28-Sep-24 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think both are pretty valuable. AMLs are probably most useful- both in corp and most profitable if you are selling on the CX


[28-Sep-24 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of need for tungsten.


[28-Sep-24 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Plus it’s nice and easy to do single building bases 😁


[28-Sep-24 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Alright I will put together a plan for pure AML and mixed AML and LAB


[28-Sep-24 03:37 PM] melon164#0000
Don't go 9×AML zero STO.  It's too painful 🙀


[28-Sep-24 03:42 PM] melon164#0000
You physically can't fit more than 48 hours worth of inputs and consumables, and most of the recipes are weight-increasing, so you can't even hide lots of inventory in the queue because you can't get it out again.  My Bober base has 9 AML and it's probably a third of my shipping 😭


[28-Sep-24 03:44 PM] exeler#0000
I've started toying with the idea of building ships just to serve as extra storage for a planet. STO takes permit space, but a stationary ship doesn't


[28-Sep-24 03:45 PM] melon164#0000
Exactly: my oldest ship is basically parked at Bober, with brief trips back to the CX to dump inventory and return before the next cycle is done


[28-Sep-24 03:46 PM] melon164#0000
It's the only one of my bases where I deliberately sync the orders rather than stagger them, so they all dump at once


[28-Sep-24 03:47 PM] exeler#0000
Can completed orders dump straight into a ships inventory, or do you have to move the stuff regularly?


[28-Sep-24 03:48 PM] melon164#0000
No, have to move stuff


[28-Sep-24 04:02 PM] melon164#0000
Eg: the 320 BER plus 10 BTS is enough to start the next round, but the BER recipe expands so you can't store more than one round.  So I have two days to get the ship back with more BER, plus enough empty space to shuffle things around, or the second cycle will jam it up.

Just go 8 AML and a STO like a sane person 😉

[28-Sep-24 04:06 PM] melon164#0000
🤔 don't actually build that unless you have a legacy HBL that you don't want to get rid of for sentimental reasons 😂


[28-Sep-24 04:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah I don’t have a single base without a STO


[28-Sep-24 04:26 PM] akyantor#0000
I've only a single base.. my first. Ever since all have at least one... it's too much faff messing around with warehouses moving stuff around when you've got any number of bases at all.


[28-Sep-24 08:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
I run my WPL bases without it since they're so lightweight


[28-Sep-24 08:53 PM] hernanduer#0000

[30-Sep-24 09:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently, what they previously said about gateway links must be 1:1 and symmetric didn't mean what we thought, because they have just written: 

``` So, why 'links' in plural then? While a gateway can only have one outgoing link, several other gateways might link to this gateway. We need a way to show which other gateways want to link to this gateway, so the operators can make an informed decision about the link.```

and 

``` Once the link is established, ships can travel between the gateways in both directions ```


[30-Sep-24 09:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Made note of this in ADI: https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1283881894966202469/1290312851273285715

I cleared it out there, but if the links aren't reciprocal then the link is incomplete


[30-Sep-24 09:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
and incomplete doesn't function per `We are currently thinking about what should happen with flights that plan to use the gateway, but the link changed or became incomplete in the meantime.`


[30-Sep-24 09:15 AM] mrsmith33#0000
This part is a bit confusing:
> That other gateway has to link back in order for the link to be complete.
Seems like they are saying that gateway operator needs to approve incoming links from other gateway in order for link to become operational.

no one is gonna be building 300mil decorative structures that have incomplete links


[30-Sep-24 09:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
idk what he's thinking


[30-Sep-24 09:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
The `link back` can be read as `2 gateways must link to each other`, and also as `1 gateway needs to establish outgoing link, while the other needs to establish incoming link`


[30-Sep-24 09:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
well the links are only outgoing


[30-Sep-24 09:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
how it reads is that each gateway must be linked to the other, or the link is incomplete


[30-Sep-24 09:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
incomplete links do not function


[30-Sep-24 09:38 AM] melon164#0000
Each gateway opens a link halfway to the other.  If they don't meet in the middle, any travellers are dropped into another dimension

[30-Sep-24 11:30 AM] _bojidar#0000
i know coalitions are  getting ready for gateways...but it will depend how it will work after its built..taxes? shares? how will return these investments for example? who control it.. it if its goverment building?


[30-Sep-24 11:35 AM] _bojidar#0000
about links imo its just that you need 2x2gates for a link to work

[30-Sep-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
But mostly we don't reaaaaaaally know how much income they will generate or how much use they will get


[30-Sep-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think we should assume running a gateway isn't really a profitable thing


[30-Sep-24 11:43 AM] _bojidar#0000
from what i read devs assume about 200 jumps per day at gate..but such high investments will be are really long run return as there are ..how many..500..1000 people playing? i havent seen more then 400 online..


[30-Sep-24 11:43 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, given the cost I don't think these things are going to be a money spinner... mostly a prestige thing to start, particularly given the ownership structure.


[30-Sep-24 11:44 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess we'll see if there's interest still in building any with that being the case.


[30-Sep-24 11:45 AM] _bojidar#0000
and if only goverment control..so coalition in control distribute taxes..still not atractive..i mean if a coalition lose control..so they lose all there investments


[30-Sep-24 11:48 AM] _bojidar#0000
Here's some numbers copied from analysis btw:
Primary Route Distances (Left, Right, Regular jumps):
Benten<>Antares - 38.02,  61.40,  61
Antares<>Hortus - 36.23,  40.40,  61
Hortus<>Moria - 41.42,  65.04,  50
Moria<>Benten - 37.63,  39.22,  47
Antares<>Moria - 61.02,  65.76,  81
Hortus<>Benten - 57.60,  56.46,  94


[30-Sep-24 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, losing control is a big concern 🤷‍♂️


[30-Sep-24 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
Although if the income is very low, then maybe there's no incentive for someone else to take control 😆


[30-Sep-24 12:01 PM] _bojidar#0000
I know that the ANT coalition is planning exactly that, and it seems like some corps will essentially merge into the same coalition, and therefore share system.
There's still discussion going on behind the scenes, and the general plan is that once consensus is achieved in the coordination group, they will present fully-formed plans to the wider community and enable public buy-in.

I think we can definitely have some sway if we have any preferences, as available capital is of course a concern. Honestly I don't know how many people will be able to spend even 1-10M in the support of this, and so we expect the vast majority of funding to come from the relatively few of us wealthier players (i.e. ~100M+ net worth).


[30-Sep-24 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a lot of the headliner "super wealthy" players aren't very interested in putting 100m+ into "vanity projects". But we'll see


[30-Sep-24 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am hoping we might nail down a route and then start asking for financial/resource commitments

Something like that

I'd burn out pretty quick if I could expand indefinitely, I think


[03-Oct-24 05:51 PM] melon164#0000
managing two ships at a time and 10-15 bases is manageable at a sustainable level for me


[03-Oct-24 05:51 PM] melon164#0000
I've bought pro three times and had promo codes twice I think


[03-Oct-24 05:52 PM] melon164#0000
the second one was a special one from Molp to test a bug for them, though, I don't think you can use multiple promo codes normally


[03-Oct-24 05:52 PM] melon164#0000
thanks for the offer though 🙂

Gateways will be a multi-year, multi-stage project to connect the various regions, the primary usage being connecting the 4 main CX regions.

This poll is aimed to find out which Gateways links will be most useful and should be priortized, and which systems between CX's will gain the most advantage from being the midpoint.
We don't yet know just...

Supernova's survey


[06-Oct-24 07:32 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm not sure if the discussion around gateways has started to over-index on trying to connect the CXs, rather than focusing on interconnecting travel within a CX area. It may be personal bias... but I've yet to even visit any other CX other than ANT. Maybe I'm underestimating how much CX<->CX traffic there is?


[06-Oct-24 09:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I do it pretty rarely. I think there are a handful of players who just spread out and pick planets from each region, so they probably do more back and forth. And there's also a small number who really want to do CX-to-CX arbitrage


[06-Oct-24 09:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I don't think it's necessarily a ton of people, but I think more people do CX-to-CX than to any other specific planet


[06-Oct-24 10:03 AM] marat_sh#0000
I still think that first 8 gates should be in faction spaces for distant systems with high trafic to CX


[06-Oct-24 10:07 AM] max.kalina#0000
I am making round trip between ANT and HRT every 3 days with 2K/2K ship. And I need more ships to make HRT-MOR😎. I am selling my C on MOR, even paying for delivery 5000 ICA, I receive more money if selling C on HRT. To ANT I am bringing DW, RAT, KOM, WIN, ALE, etc.

[06-Oct-24 10:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
I probably make a trip to another CX a week on average - sometimes I end up with a bunch of ICA / NCC / whatever, so I try to turn it into AIC that way


[06-Oct-24 10:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
NCC is always hard though. Seems like prices are almost universally higher in MOR whenever I make a trip 😄


[06-Oct-24 10:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
To some degree, I think we should view inter-CX gateways as inducing demand, rather than serving an existing market. I imagine more people will make the trip once it's faster / easier / potentially cheaper


[06-Oct-24 10:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
I've been trying to think of ways to estimate how many ships travel between CXs. I wonder if we could basically just look at a system between the two and count ships on a few different days to get a rough (possibly Poisson-distributed) estimate


[06-Oct-24 10:52 AM] marat_sh#0000
Would anyone be interested in selling my EXOs and REPs to other CXs? I don't do trips to other CXs


[06-Oct-24 11:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
I also never really do CX to CX but maybe it'll induce demand, just probably not from me


[06-Oct-24 12:29 PM] max.kalina#0000
I could sell them on HRT, which price is suitable for you to sell?


[06-Oct-24 12:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
depends on the max for you how much it would worth


[06-Oct-24 12:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
there is only 20 BID on HRT for EXO


[06-Oct-24 12:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
so I don't think it's gonna worth for you


[06-Oct-24 12:32 PM] marat_sh#0000

For a low maintenance base too, relatively simple consumables and non-existing material inputs.

lowstrife said he had to convert a lot to AIC to get the money for the shields


[08-Oct-24 08:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
My takeaway from the FX right now is that everyone wants AIC and nobody wants NCC 😄


[08-Oct-24 08:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
I have so much NCC that I’m gonna have to start importing from MOR and selling to ANT at breakeven just to change the money


[08-Oct-24 08:43 AM] zipatsu#0000
Once all the gateways are connected we can abandon the inferior CX's and just move everything to ANT (*I've not looked into how Gateways work this is just the dream*) ✌️


[08-Oct-24 08:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
One CX just gonna be better then others


[08-Oct-24 08:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
One CX to rule them all? 😁


[08-Oct-24 08:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I do seriously think that the grant programs in ANT have contributed a lot to the strength of the CX overall, both in terms of things made in ANT as well as just the amount of buying and selling that happens


[08-Oct-24 08:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah that grant was a W move

at this price H is pretty good


[13-Oct-24 09:09 AM] turlorn_angren#0000
60/u is very good. at the CX you pay more than double of that.


[13-Oct-24 09:23 AM] marat_sh#0000
at 150/u it's 80k+ per day base


[13-Oct-24 02:33 PM] allocater#0000

The discrepencies from CX price to base area day price can be pretty high


[13-Oct-24 09:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
some things are 300 AIC per base area day, some are 1500


[13-Oct-24 09:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
are you not breaking them down into their consituent parts?


[13-Oct-24 09:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
if you count just the BAd of the final stage, you have to pull out all the costs of the inputs


[13-Oct-24 09:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
and it'll skew due to vertical integration for more complex things


[13-Oct-24 09:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
making them look worse than they actually are


[14-Oct-24 10:26 AM] allocater#0000
I think this is to be expected, since some bases make 50k/day other make 200k/day.


[14-Oct-24 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
Those are the sum BAd of all steps


[14-Oct-24 10:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
hmmm but for ADE to make the KV it needs, that alone is 32 BAd (69120 / 86400 * 40 = 32 BAd for the WPL)


[14-Oct-24 10:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
then the population housing is another 7.896 BA (for the WPL)


[14-Oct-24 10:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
so just the KV is more than the 34 BAd you're showing in the list


[14-Oct-24 11:35 AM] archielvahr#0000

More H production would certainly not hurt.  I was holding it at 80/u for quite a while, but I think a major H producer must have dropped out.  I expanded my base on ANT IIg to 1000 and even that plus some from KI-401d isn't enough to drive it below 150/u.  I should probably rename myself to Dragon Gas, lol, I'm the number 4 producer of H and number two of AR.

PP3 is all the craze at the moment


[27-Oct-24 04:02 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I have 2000 MAG, time to demolish Avalon base and make a construction base on IY-816d. Will relocate 15 PP2 from ZV-194b, and turn ZV-194b into a multipurpose construction base (WEL, INS, TSH, maybe UPF)

LS-231 is getting the first gateway, linked with Heph. If anyone has a preference for which planet in heph, mention it here:

@archielvahr does the gov calculator take into account the increased education with the presence of LIB and UNI?


[31-Oct-24 09:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
just curious if balancing like Ogrebeef is saying in Eos chat would be possible using the calculator


[31-Oct-24 09:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yes, it takes it into effect. I'm not sure if deactivated buildings change the education constant or not


[31-Oct-24 09:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
per the convo, sounds like they have to be active


[31-Oct-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
A big PrunPlanner change went into effect today:

`Workforce Cost Integration: After extensive discussion on the PCT Discord, workforce costs are now factored into daily revenue and ROI projections for recipes.`

I think a lot of people were relying very heavily on the recipe ROI numbers and not paying too close attention to the total base ROI, so over time. this might shift around some prices.


[01-Nov-24 02:08 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
are there other agricultural planets with fertile soil in Antares space other than Harmonia and Demeter?
or do i have to build more hydroponic farms now?


[01-Nov-24 02:10 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Demeter is outside of ANT space


[01-Nov-24 02:10 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Phobos and Deimos are fertile and in ANT space, but not Agri


[01-Nov-24 02:11 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Electronica and Etherwind are fertile and not in ANT space, and not Agri


[01-Nov-24 02:12 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i see. thanks for the info.
then i'll build hydroponic farms on thalassa b next.


[01-Nov-24 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
HYF is really nice, you get a lot of crops out of them.


[02-Nov-24 04:03 AM] allocater#0000
maybe long term the limited farms will be only used for HER and HYF does everything else


[02-Nov-24 10:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
This is exactly what I'm already doing exclusively


[02-Nov-24 10:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
And GRN


[02-Nov-24 02:55 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
this works out financially with buying/producing NS?


[02-Nov-24 05:30 PM] akyantor#0000
Is there any way to get a list of currently required repair materials for your base? I found an API to return building repair status for each building, but doesn't seem there's a FIO API that directly returns the required mats. *Or do you have to calculate a proportion of initial build materials using the condition to calculate your own list.*


[02-Nov-24 07:01 PM] zipatsu#0000
There's the relatively recently added BRA command, if you set the minimum condition to 100% it'll show you the amount needed to repair everything in a base. You can even look up to 2 days ahead with it as well ✌️

[02-Nov-24 07:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do the same with my HYFs, it seems to work out great. You can fit more HYFs on a planet than you can FRMs, and they run faster. My income per base has been good, and in Thalassa, bringing in your own water from ISA is cheap and easy


[02-Nov-24 08:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
There is also XIT Repair in PMMG


[02-Nov-24 09:15 PM] tuffyless#0000
Same here.

My 1 NS base on ZV-639d is able to feed 2 HYF bases.
One on Life (making MAI & HCP for C)  & another on SE-110b (making MAI, VEG, MUS for RAT).

Have a backup NS base on KW-688d creating additional NS, when needed, which usually happens after spamming CAF & RCO for awhile on both HYF bases.

Then 2 FRM bases, on Harmonia & Demeter.
They both alternate between GRN & HER every cycle.


[02-Nov-24 09:18 PM] tuffyless#0000
H2O kinda gets tight when adding in the production of DW for long periods of time on FP bases.
So I find the need to manually dethrottle on some things requiring less H2O for abit so it'll catch up.
It's a manual-balancing act.


[02-Nov-24 09:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
Supply for H2O comes from Etherwind, ISA, and SE-648b.  
648b swaps between BER & H2O but it spends most of the time on H2O.
Rarely have to buy from Zip except in extreme situations.

As long as you are using a permit, I always try to fill the base


[07-Nov-24 10:53 AM] akyantor#0000
I had previously balanced it out by making some FLX there, but will reduce or remove that in favour of extraction


[07-Nov-24 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think I sold about 3/4 of my BTS in the corp. But people did buy it on the CX also and I had a pretty crazy markup on the CX price.


[07-Nov-24 10:53 AM] akyantor#0000
As I didn't need that much FLX


[07-Nov-24 10:53 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm just going to ditch that and buy FLX instead


[07-Nov-24 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000

[08-Nov-24 09:00 AM] akyantor#0000
I think to feed a full Nike when I looked seemed to require more than a permit of EPO

@hernanduer I've shot you a contract for some TSH, if you have any lying around, so I can max out that BTS base. Thinking of shipping out the fabs to expand later today or tomorrow. If you're out let me know, and I'll go to the market.

I prefer to buy everything on Ant anyways, I run super centralized


[08-Nov-24 09:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
And my Nike is 8 or 9 PP4s, so it doesn't use EPO on its own, per se


[08-Nov-24 09:51 AM] akyantor#0000
I tend to do the same. Hub and spoke. I very rarely attempt to ship between two bases, 95% of trips are between a base and ANT.


[08-Nov-24 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yep, I've added a small secondary hub for 6115 but even that takes its own screen


[08-Nov-24 09:52 AM] akyantor#0000

[10-Nov-24 11:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
since HAL in same system


[10-Nov-24 11:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
if it's just you and CHP, then you'd probably want an SST to maintain the SETs


[10-Nov-24 11:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
they can be finicky

Honestly you can start a planet for like 4-5 mil. It just takes a few weeks

time is not a problem, I was just interested if someone would also be interested in financing it as well


[10-Nov-24 12:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I could drop you some cash (but I should maybe put some cash in the bank to while I’m thinking about it)


[10-Nov-24 12:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
It's a plan for like a month or two into the future


[10-Nov-24 12:56 PM] marat_sh#0000

[10-Nov-24 12:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No worries ☺️


[10-Nov-24 12:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's just convenience to refine HAL in same system


[10-Nov-24 06:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
eh, you really wanna check STL flight times and meteroid density before considering that


[10-Nov-24 06:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
some systems are HUGE and it's faster to jump 3 systems away than to go from the g to the c planet, for example


[10-Nov-24 06:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
also meteroids can really wreck your ships

Is the info in the devlog about gateway upgrades (max five total upgrades across range, size and capacity) new?  Does it affect strategy at all?


[12-Nov-24 09:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
not new


[12-Nov-24 09:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
kind of a redundant devlog, not really sure why he went over all that data, it's already been spread around from the test server


[12-Nov-24 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I think they are just stretching out the dev logs


[12-Nov-24 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000

Okay I'm looking for about 384 HSE and 192 PSH for gateway stuff. I would also take TCS and make HSE myself. 

I can reimburse:
83.24 gateway shares per HSE (that's $142.80 AIC per share given the market price of HSE)
55.99 gateway shares per PSH ($183.09 per share given the current market price)
Or I can reimburse at 10k and 6k AIC each (Or NCC 😉 )

[02-Dec-24 12:30 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Hey guys,


[02-Dec-24 12:31 PM] superbadsounds#0000
So I'm looking at plans for Styx c and b.. and what I can contribute there, and I feel like I could help fill the TSH, ADE, and ATA we still need.

My thoughts are to get these bases up and rolling, let them recoup the 15m (11m build, 4m consumables) investment over the first 45 days or so, and then divert 5 TSH, 5 ADE, and 5 ATA to the gateways each day for 3-4 months.

AGC Contributions and fulfillment goals would be:
650 TSH (with Construction COGC: 130 days/with Manufacturing COGC: 163 days)
560 ADE (with Construction COGC: 112/with Manufacturing COGC: 140)
690 ATA (with Construction COGC: 138/with Manufacturing COGC: 173)

The total timeline for my contributions would be roughly 180-210 days (June 2025) and should net me about 10% ownership of the project shares. 

Styx c (TSH, ADE, and ATA)
https://prunplanner.org/shared/70f5dab3-fb98-49c2-9d58-4c4753225d89

Aratora (Support for Styx c with: CF, HE)
https://prunplanner.org/shared/a74711d3-262c-4642-b6ef-67d551733f68

My main concerns are with pops and the COGC change down the line.

Styx c will need 320 TEC and 240 ENG, while Aratora will need 140 TEC and 100 ENG. Only Styx c has the TEC, and neither planet has any ENG currently. What does the timeline usually look like for developing t4 pops?

When do you expect we might switch Styx c to Manufacturing? I think I can still make these plans work with a mismatched COGC, but I'm also open to moving construction operations to Styx d if it makes more sense.

bonus question..

When do we expect Gateways to be released? A quick search around the discords didn't bring out anything obvious. If it's far enough away, I could contribute more TSH and AFABS. If I have until late Septemeber 2025, I could supply all the remaining TSH and switch my AFAB production to make 350 ABH and 350 ASE when the time is right. My total contribution would be at about 16.5% by that point with 1000 TSH, 350 ABH, 560 ADE, 350 ASE, 690 ATA.

WALL OF TEXT
TLDR:  I want to help with AGC and settle in to Styx, but I don't want to be dumb. Poke holes in my plans


[02-Dec-24 12:34 PM] superbadsounds#0000
an update: I've spoken with @prophetar who governs Aratora. He is pushing for ENG pops and happy to make sure I get everything I need. He also mentioned that while most people on planet want to keep the Resource COGC, he wants to move it into Chemistry.


[02-Dec-24 12:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Awesome, always glad to have more people getting into Gateway mats. The afabs are a good choice, since they have basically unlimited demand even without the gateways.  Nike is a great place to build them since they are easy to move, so I would consider that before building them onsite on Styx c. But you can make the LDE on Styx, or other low-tech construction workers. OOG's HQ is on Nike, so getting the expensive PP4s there is nice.


[02-Dec-24 12:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
It sounds like other people were interested in keeping the Construction COGC most of the time for Styx C, so we can plan on that. I expect to flip  it to Manuf for a few weeks right after launch so we can produce the GWS on site.


[02-Dec-24 12:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then flip it back to construction


[02-Dec-24 01:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
As for a release date, we don't really know. My guess is 3 months. The devs don't have a flight through a gateway yet, so there are flight planner changes to make, plus taxing UI, etc.  Allocating production out to June/Sept is pretty tough, especially if you have loans out. I am hoping we have gateways done and built by September 2025 😆


[02-Dec-24 01:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
So you might want to compress that, esp if you have more room for growth. I see you're at 17 bases and that's probably close to where things start to slow down, so it's not a red flag to invest in gateways at this point


[02-Dec-24 01:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Others can hop in on that point too.


[02-Dec-24 01:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know we're gonna need a lot of ASM time post launch for the new ALR and WRH alloys. And I'm happy to delegate AAF/ APF time as well


[02-Dec-24 01:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think my ask for the corp is to stock up all your ASM products and have as many people as possible flip over to the Rhenium alloys. Then we can start the Torus segments and Singularity stabilizers asap


[02-Dec-24 02:15 PM] superbadsounds#0000
This is what I really needed to hear. I've got some AFABs going at Nike and Gibson now with another TSH/AFAB base going up on Yannick today, but I'll reassess Styx

Additionally it's worth noting that the GWS and TRS have a ton of components inside them, and you can help out doing those subcomponents too.

@melon164  and I have a lot of those planned for the first two, but there's more coming. I do expect to rely on other people's RHO


[02-Dec-24 09:52 PM] katinga#0000
Based on what I currently produce, can I help in any way with raw materials?  I mine and smelt TIO/TI, ALO/AL, & SIO/SI.  I also produce LST, H, AMM, and GAL


[02-Dec-24 09:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
How many ASMs do you have?


[02-Dec-24 09:54 PM] katinga#0000
Assimilated Smiling Manatees?  not a 1


[02-Dec-24 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
I assume it's "Advanced Smelters" but the building name is "High-Power Blast Furnace" so who knows what ASM stands for 😆


[02-Dec-24 10:00 PM] katinga#0000
I have SMEs


[02-Dec-24 10:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Unfortunately those metals aren't used a ton. TI and AL in the lfabs/rfabs/afabs. The PSH / RSH/ TSH is going to be a bottleneck, so see if any of those line up with what you make.


[02-Dec-24 10:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you like raw materials as a thing, you can open a Krypton tap or a RHO tap, but that will happen after the new mats are released


[02-Dec-24 10:03 PM] katinga#0000
I can do that


[02-Dec-24 10:04 PM] katinga#0000
I'm still in the 'middle class' of players.  I don't really shell out for the higher type of workers.  I do have SET for my SF base, though.


[02-Dec-24 10:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think often the higher workers are easier since they tend to have much lower shipping requirement


[02-Dec-24 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah looking at the chart I think the construction products are the biggest bottleneck


[02-Dec-24 10:08 PM] katinga#0000
I can definitely contribute TI and AL.


[02-Dec-24 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if you want, I can buy your AL in exchange for shares, then take care of the processing into whatever I need


[02-Dec-24 10:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or I can buy it for cash, giving you the cash donated to the project, then the donator gets shares


[02-Dec-24 10:11 PM] marat_sh#0000

[02-Dec-24 10:14 PM] tuffyless#0000
Is the ASM demand because of expected WRH & ALR ?

Yep

10 GWS takes 2000 WRH


[02-Dec-24 10:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
and the TORs require 4000 ALR


[02-Dec-24 10:28 PM] tuffyless#0000
geez ... I foresee more local Metallurgy CoGC's becoming a thing 🙂


[02-Dec-24 10:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
200 AST takes forever and both these alloys are much slower than AST


[03-Dec-24 12:13 AM] evov#0000
If people want to build ASM's on IA-151e (metallurgy planet in the gateway project I'm working on)- I'll work out a price with them to buy their outputs now until they need the buildings for production of gateway mats later. I'll note that it's conveniently close to TIO / TI production in the SE region if that helps.


[03-Dec-24 01:46 AM] melon164#0000
Equally I'll help anyone who wants to set up on KI-401b and KI-401a producing TI or ASM products, and then flip over to rhodium products for a bit after launch.

If you're sitting on LSE, now's the time to sell it on the CX!


[04-Dec-24 12:04 PM] katinga#0000
I'm installing a new smelting base at Deimos.  I might put one in KI after that


[04-Dec-24 12:37 PM] katinga#0000
Ya know, though, with all the smelting people are probably going to be doing for the gateways, we're going to need more carbon production.  My burners can't keep up with my consumption as it is.  Although, one of my smelting bases is for SIO and that shorter run time really chews carbon up fast.


[04-Dec-24 12:46 PM] max.kalina#0000
I could help with C


[04-Dec-24 12:46 PM] tyrandia#0000
I'd be happy to sell my carbon in house. I generate roughly 100 a day.

I’m planning to renovate my Harmonia base to mass-produce HCP. I also have a small base all the way out in Verdant which sustains itself and kicks out a little C.

Okay I did a bunch of math. At the sheet's base-area-day values, AL comes up at 7.82 shares per item, which puts it pretty close to the lower end of AIC per share- down with LTA. I'll bump that up to 10.5 for you, so that'll be 21000 shares. It will be recorded like this:

[09-Dec-24 04:01 PM] superbadsounds#0000
This may fall outside of most peoples immediate interest here, but I'm needing some electronics production near Katoa in support of my AAF and APF. Anyone have a good guide for developing a planet? I'm considering spinning up Tarvos in Benten for the sake of proximity, but would love some input from those more versed in building planetary infrastructure.


[09-Dec-24 04:02 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I have no sense of scale for costs on a project like this, other than my planned base needing roughly 9m in build mats.. Are we talking 10m for a COGC and popi? 100m?


[09-Dec-24 04:25 PM] evov#0000
The planets I've been spooling up in the IA region - about 7mil. For Scientists, probably allow 10mil. Plus a fairly long time of low productivity while pop builds.


[09-Dec-24 04:26 PM] evov#0000
The more important question is - electronics are quite low on the transport requirements, so how important is it that you keep production local/close to your AAF/APF's ?


[09-Dec-24 04:34 PM] evov#0000
If you do really really want your electronics and APFs/AAF's right next to each other - consider looking at this gateway project I'm working on in the IA region. - e.g. Electronics + Manufacturing right next to each other - currently supporting mid-high level pop tiers already.

I still feel BEN space is missing some local electronics production. But maybe it doesn't make sense long term.

Building prefab very expensive


[12-Dec-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was just noticing that I think we are pretty short on fabs. There's been a bunch of orders lately and I'm totally out


[12-Dec-24 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think we're at the point where most people will probably be purchasing bfabs from the MM at the MM price. But lfabs seem to be in short supply too.


[12-Dec-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I still have some lfabs in stock, but I only make like 5 of each a day


[12-Dec-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've been considering dropping my bfab production entirely and only making lfabs on Nike, now might be a good time to do that


[12-Dec-24 12:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I’ve been buying bfabs from cx for a while 😅 They are not that expensive in comparison to other fabs


[12-Dec-24 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
i do have 80 of the 100 LDE you're looking for if you'd like them, just stuck on mobile atm 😄


[12-Dec-24 12:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
There is no rush on that order I just need them in general 😅


[12-Dec-24 12:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
It’s for TCL base


[12-Dec-24 12:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can partially fill it and I can send you contract 👍


[12-Dec-24 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can knock 1k/u off the price since you're sending me contracts on an order 🙂

Some questions for you guys: 
How do you maintain momentum and growth through the end game? 

I have been able to add roughly 1m of daily profit per month played since my COLIQ, but what do I do now that I've hit the HQ level soft cap? 

The return on HQ levels makes expansion loans seem much less attractive, but is that still a viable path?


[16-Dec-24 11:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
maybe this isn't a super useful answer, but I kinda haven't maintained growth (at least according to my FINCH)

[16-Dec-24 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm just getting HQ upgrades 19 and 20 now - for the most part, I focused on re-purposing some of my previous bases that were no longer super profitable / didn't really support my core business. Lots of bases that were super profitable at the time but could be better utilized other ways


[16-Dec-24 11:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
personally, I don't take loans at this point because I have enough cash to do what I want, but with >1M daily profit there's not really a reason not to take loans. you can just take larger amounts / pay them back faster


[16-Dec-24 11:35 AM] superbadsounds#0000
I was considering cutting out some of the chains I find less satisfying, like agriculture and FP, and making more project focused bases for Styx, Nyx, and 151. 

This doesn't necessarily make me more money, but it would help me contribute to the gateways faster, which gets me mucho savings in time and money down the line.


[16-Dec-24 11:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s kinda what I’ve been doing - cutting down on annoying or boring bases, refocusing more on agriculture and FP (someone has to do it 😄), experimenting with electronics


[16-Dec-24 11:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’m sure others will have helpful perspective as well


[16-Dec-24 12:20 PM] exeler#0000
I think building specialized goals is the key. 

At some point making more money hits a huge plateau so it doesn't make sense as a primary goal any more.


[16-Dec-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been dropping things like FRM planets, and instead of making low level software like LD, I buy that and use the extra space for SE buildings instead.


[16-Dec-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sponsored bases can help drive you forward, but that's a lot of overhead


[16-Dec-24 01:07 PM] cptboby#0000
Am i correctly assuming EDC and IDC will always be needed?


[16-Dec-24 01:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
They will never be needed but always be profitable 😄


[16-Dec-24 01:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
more or less, yes - you can sell them infinitely to the game

The devs have been slowly nerfing them over the years, but they are very slow at it.


[16-Dec-24 02:07 PM] cptboby#0000
i thought they were a consumable for certain buildings


[16-Dec-24 02:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
they are, but there are usually cheaper alternatives for those buildings, and the demand is tiny compared to how many are produced. for example, the level 5 UNI on malahat only uses 75 IDC every 20 days


[16-Dec-24 02:12 PM] cptboby#0000
huh


[16-Dec-24 02:12 PM] cptboby#0000
and what is MM?


[16-Dec-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
market maker - it's those infinite orders you see in certain order books


[16-Dec-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
basically the game will buy or sell an infinite amount of an item to you at a certain price


[16-Dec-24 02:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
so the basic goods like DW, RAT have them so the universe never runs out, and some high-level goods like IDC have buy orders so there's always demand


[16-Dec-24 02:17 PM] cptboby#0000
wierd way of injecting money into the system

[17-Dec-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was considering hitting you up, the price I have right now for RSH is 26k.. which isn't greaaaaaaaat


[17-Dec-24 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can bump it up a little bit if we get desperate, but I also want to make sure the financial contributors get a good Share per AIC ratio


[17-Dec-24 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I saw you had some on the CX, I figured that was sort of an arbitrarily high price


[17-Dec-24 02:30 PM] evov#0000
I'll have to re-check, but no, I think the prices I threw them up there at are about where it needs to be to be worth making them.


[17-Dec-24 02:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Gotcha. the base area day calcs probably value TA somewhat low. Although it throws the iron out of the recipe.. cause AMLs are weird with multiple outputs.


[17-Dec-24 02:32 PM] evov#0000
At the moment I'm just ( for an arbitrary goal in the game ) trying to produce a full gateway myself. But once I've built all the stuff for it, I'll switch production over to something more useful. So I need the sale cost to be competetive with whatever else I would be producing.

{Reactions}
👍 

[17-Dec-24 02:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
undervalues the AML because it doesn't account for the hassle of the high tier pop. (it does account for the workforce cost)


[17-Dec-24 02:36 PM] evov#0000
For a reference point - these are the internal numbers I threw onto these items. Subject to change in the future, but should be kinda close hopefully -

## Gateway Mats!

Thanks to very generous financial contributions by Bojidar, Sidepipe, and Akyan with 130m received, I am looking to buy the following:

100 LIT @ 19k
100 CBL @ 91k
150 ASE @ 36k
300 ABH @ 43k
800 RSH @ 26k
5000 SP @ 2600
200 PSH @ 8000
400 HSE @ 11,500


[17-Dec-24 02:43 PM] evov#0000
Just looking at RSH as the example - 
TA at 20k each seems expensive. But even at that price - still leaves AML's making it at 35day Roi - not bad, but hardly a golden goose. I could imagine that price dropping a bit, but not a huge amount because otherwise those AML's will just pump out ZR or BE instead.

[17-Dec-24 03:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's pretty much my thought. If I can buy enough other items at a good price, it can subsidize a higher price for the RSH


[17-Dec-24 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
And I sort of prepped the cash contributors that the cash is likely to be weighted towards the stuff no one wants to contribute at the given share prices


[17-Dec-24 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have an abundance of NCC for the donations, do you want NCC or AIC?


[17-Dec-24 03:04 PM] evov#0000
AIC is definitely preffered. I have enough extra NCC that I tend to just use it to retaliate on the MOR market every time they mess with ANT.

{Reactions}
😆 

[17-Dec-24 03:05 PM] evov#0000
Which . . on a related note.... anyone know if the current high PE prices are natural or is a MORdog responsible?


[17-Dec-24 03:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
could be both... a high volume on thin market


[17-Dec-24 03:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
BMPs were kinda crap for a while Some people (me included) switched production


[17-Dec-24 03:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
it was like what... 300k PE traded in a few days?


[17-Dec-24 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
There was a really big purchase in the past few days


[17-Dec-24 03:09 PM] melon164#0000
I have a lot of TA production, far more than I have PP4 for


[17-Dec-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think someone is attempting shenanigans, cause they bought 1m PE across ANT and Moria

[18-Dec-24 01:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am working and can't watch stream... is it like multiple items in one item (like a new recipe for BMPs for example that takes PIO inputs and make "packaged" output?)


[18-Dec-24 01:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
So this is what it sounds like it works like. 
Someone builds a "packager" building. It takes 100 DW, 100 RAT, 10 OVE, 10 COF, 5 PWO, plus some "packaging material" like PE or something. Then it makes 1 "packaged consumable. And you ship the consumable somewhere and it unpacks and you feed your workforce.

I'm not sure if this is better than shipping bulk supplies?


[18-Dec-24 01:35 PM] katinga#0000
You're still going to have to ship more than one package for your bases


[18-Dec-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I have a lot of mixed population bases.


[18-Dec-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
It sounds like an optional thing. I guess it's fewer items in a ship often


[18-Dec-24 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Although DW is shared across other pops so.. 🤷‍♂️


[18-Dec-24 01:37 PM] katinga#0000
maybe because you buy 1 thing 10 times instead of 5 things 10 times?

EW-238c is far enough away that you'd want to do some vertical integration, but it's got great HAL deposits.  WU-974c is actually not that far away


[19-Dec-24 12:48 PM] melon164#0000
I reeeeaaly want to build a gateway to EW-238c


[19-Dec-24 01:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
GM-332c is even better 😉


[19-Dec-24 10:16 PM] evov#0000
IA-151d , IA-158c - Chem planets within 24hrs flight time of ANT cx. Both have pop infrastructure support for up to engineers at the moment.

151d is potentially open for more people to join it, 158c might take a couple of weeks before the current pop requirements are filled


[19-Dec-24 11:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well my thought was putting AMLs on Bober and then placing CHPs somewhere else

looking for advice, Iv got 1 spare permit and dont know what to do with it. Whats a profitable 1 base setup nowadays?

[26-Dec-24 10:19 AM] roche3950#0000
I’m actually planning to set up a chem base on Elon or Electronica. What’s the official plan re: FLX from our side?

Selling internally to avoid the CX problems?


[26-Dec-24 10:26 AM] roche3950#0000
if I don’t just scale up CL production, ha


[26-Dec-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
If you wanna do FLX, agamemnon is better since it’s next door to Nike


[26-Dec-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
Elon is good for PG


[26-Dec-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
I use elextronica as mix base CL->EPO


[26-Dec-24 10:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
Bober is probably best for advanced labs since you get metals as well

[27-Dec-24 03:22 AM] evov#0000
I ran dry of HE earlier today. Saw it left the CX pretty dry after I bought what I needed so I bought out the HE on the rest of the CX's up to about the price I left it on ANT. I've just been really lazy about sending ships out to the other CX's to bring it back to the motherland.


[27-Dec-24 12:04 PM] exeler#0000
I have more than enough HE for everyone. I just don't list it on the CX.


[31-Dec-24 10:32 AM] hernanduer#0000

Feels like such a waste of a permit.


[01-Jan-25 05:02 PM] tuffyless#0000
Was debating whether between Milliways or Hermes.  Decided to go with Milli because Hermes costs AEF.  Ouchy for FP's.

Rise has contacted me to let know they are stepping back from some of their parliamentary positions/governorships


[04-Jan-25 04:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Guess it really was too much


[04-Jan-25 04:24 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah.  I know he is stepping down from parliament on Nascent and governor on Life, since those are the ones we spoke about.


[04-Jan-25 04:25 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm surprised he's kept up trying to look after so many for so long.


[04-Jan-25 04:25 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm an MP on Life and I'll remain such, but I don't especially want to be governor (Nascent and KI-401d is enough for me)


[04-Jan-25 04:26 PM] akyantor#0000
I look after two relatively simple planets (SE-648 & Hyalos), and that's more than enough


[04-Jan-25 04:29 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Anyway, if anyone feels like running for parliament on Nascent, or governor on Life, this is your opportunity to do so

[10-Jan-25 06:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think there is plenty of O on the market it's just people stopped posting it on CX

not too cheap in ANT either


[13-Jan-25 12:34 AM] evov#0000
Not sure if this is the cause or not, but just after xmas time ( Dec 27th ) I was running low on HE, and saw the the ANT cx was also pretty much out of HE. So... I might have emptied out the other CX's of HE at the time and started shipping it back to the mother land.

I think I took about 13k from MOR, and maybe 2k from each of BEN and HRT.


[13-Jan-25 12:35 AM] evov#0000
I've been pretty slow on shipping it back. So I've still got most of MOR's HE sitting in the warehouse/on their cx at silly prices haha

Meanwhile I noticed recently all my neighbors on IY-206j had left. I think I was the only one on the planet for a while. 

Seriously, if anyone needs HE just send me a message or a CONT. I keep a stash on ANT, just usually not listed on the CX. 

I used to keep the ANT price down, but I stopped doing that a while ago just in case something wild like this happened. This is better than what I was hoping for 🤣

let me know next time!  I smelt the stuff!


[15-Jan-25 10:44 PM] evov#0000
Well, I didn't realize I was gonna buy most of it out until I noticed I was low... and the CX's were low. If I told everyone I was gonna do it before doing it, the CX's might run dry before I was able to top up my precious AL swimming pool.

But yeah, for AL (and most metals) I'll gladly buy up long term bulk contracts for whatever you can smelt. There's a few people who just cont me their smelter outputs directly on Deimos or Vulcan and I'll handle the shipping later.


[15-Jan-25 11:07 PM] tyrandia#0000
Let meee know next time... I was counting on a certain price per unit for my fab production. >_<


[15-Jan-25 11:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have about 1k extra, if you run short before the market recovers, place an order and I can probably fill it on ant at a normal price


[15-Jan-25 11:18 PM] tyrandia#0000
I'll buy it now cause I kinda need it. ❤️

[16-Jan-25 02:44 AM] evov#0000
There's no shortage of ALO on the market ( most of the galactic supply is in ANT ). So the only thing stopping increased AL production is Smelting bases. If someone wants to make a smelting base, but feel's like there are hurdles preventing them from doing so, let me know and I'm confident I can help find a workable solution.


[16-Jan-25 03:37 AM] mrsmith33#0000

650aic ea still higher than other CX


[21-Jan-25 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think he will be stuck with those 😆


[21-Jan-25 01:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
Tossed some of mine on the book at 896 as well


[21-Jan-25 01:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just to add a little more cost if he wants to try clearing it out again 😁

Speaking of OOG operation - should we be coordinating on BWS at ANT? I noticed we keep undercutting each other 😄


[21-Jan-25 01:48 PM] allocater#0000
oh, I confused you with someone else. Yeah sure, we can set 21000 but I think the market is basically non-existent.


[21-Jan-25 01:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, no kidding - seems like a bunch of people started BWS right when I did, but I think a lot of them dropped out


[21-Jan-25 01:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just listed at 20.9k to sell a few every now and then, but I have enough cash that I can sit on them basically forever


[21-Jan-25 01:52 PM] allocater#0000
there was a huge BWS demand a month ago, but I still don't know why

😮 

[21-Jan-25 01:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
So if you ever wanna buy a bunch at a discount and re-list them at 21k, let me know 😄


[21-Jan-25 01:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think I need to bring like 120 to each CX and just start selling there instead

I will make a base there + ADM + WAR

I was actually eying the same planet. Looked great for STL production to go into my PP3's on Nike. But first I need to resolve my EPO bottleneck

Abandoning. I can keep running if need.
cuz FE+FEO production not good at zv194c.

[25-Jan-25 02:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
sell is duplicate of the buy interface, only problem I see is that they're in the template interface so you can't modify an existing contract to add a new item, you have to redo the whole contract


[25-Jan-25 02:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
so make sure you get all the items the first time...


[25-Jan-25 02:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
you can still modify if you pick the wrong item, or change items or prices, same as current, you just can't add another item

[29-Jan-25 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
these are deceptively fast


[29-Jan-25 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
and the damage is remarkably lower


[29-Jan-25 11:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
despite roughly equal reactor too


[29-Jan-25 12:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
looks like 5ks are, at worst, 50% slower


[29-Jan-25 12:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the more jumps the less slower since jump speed is the same, only charge time is about double (but with a HYR that's only seconds)

Oops sorry Paris, I just saw your note on Deimos. I should read everything before I start replying, hehe


[31-Jan-25 11:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you want the governor slot, I will happily endorse you for it. Heph is one of the bigger planets, but it's weighted towards low tier workers so it shouldn't be too hard to run. My goal is just to get an MP slot for gateway administration


[31-Jan-25 12:16 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Governor on Deimos is about 750k-950k/week (depending on your costs). The taxes help but don't cover it completely. I managed to convince 2 sets of governor-aides to donate cash to the wallet, and it's still really healthy.

[12-Feb-25 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think he's being coy with the name "NULL" cause it looks like a real company code, and the name is "NullN"


[12-Feb-25 03:09 PM] shokanshi#0000

rat is pretty profitable rn, its just that its consumed so much


[03-Mar-25 07:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
They raised the price limit on fuel recently. And before that some of the B fabs.


[03-Mar-25 07:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think investing in rations would be a reasonable hedge against inflation. Especially if you can get them under MM price.


[03-Mar-25 07:59 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh fr?


[03-Mar-25 08:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
its a pretty solid investment, if you make the inputs aswell its very cheap to run


[03-Mar-25 08:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are generally pretty slow with balance changes but I think they’ve got a good handle on what’s going on.


[03-Mar-25 08:00 PM] archielvahr#0000

I will think is it possible to export MEA in future. I was worry FIM production rate can cover the consumtion rate or not. : P
So, FIM only accept related workforce in this moment.

Hoping to just vertically integrate all the way to FIM at least


[19-Mar-25 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely check if it's cheaper to buy the RATs


[19-Mar-25 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
on PP30d I have MEA at $223k/d. FIM is 182k/d.. So doing both on one planet gives you $200k/d per 500 area.

RAT is more around 100k-110k/d at MM price. 

The tool doesn't do farm products though. Probably can't buy enough farm products regularly to feed a lot of RAT planets. And I think the RAT crops aren't terribly profitable to make. Not sure about HER, if that's a "buy or make" situation


[19-Mar-25 03:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ve got two FRMs worth of HER going right now, so I’ll probably just keep that 😄

Major Market Maker Pricing Changes
As talked about on discord, I want to make a forum thread for people who might not see that. And gather more input.  The extremely quick tl;dr is: Adjusting the price of marketmakers to align with two factors. Difficulty of the recipe, and tier of workforce that is needed to make it. Something which is easy is rewarded lowly, something which is ...

I ran the numbers through the sheet Hern had made, and I am pleased with the numbers lowstrife has listed


[23-Mar-25 07:25 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I support this.. though I was just considering decommissioning my last APF chains for the time being.


[23-Mar-25 07:39 PM] evov#0000
A very cursory look at the proposed prices leads me to the following broad/macro outlook.

1. High tier manufacturing planets will be in high demand.
2. Ship prices will increase.
3. Electronics will still be required, but emphasis will shift from SCI to some of the lower pops.
4. Construction ( by way of Welding plants ) will have increased demand.


[23-Mar-25 07:58 PM] evov#0000
I think one of the side effects of having more complicated things be more profitable (drones / lis etc ) will be that it makes it harder for solo players to take advantage of money printers and benefits groups/ collectives/ collaboration/ trade.


[23-Mar-25 09:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm I hadn't thought about that. If someone really wants to make LIS or drones in high quantities, a coop model might be good. I guess I make most of the stuff on the list already (except drones), so none of it seems too inaccessible. I think the ship price increase will be pretty small, since LIS usually seems to be traded fairly close to the new MM price. Our "internal" price is 450k, but it usually trades around 600-700k.

[24-Mar-25 04:20 PM] akyantor#0000
Well... a lot of people have piled in on IDC bases, so I gues it's not surprising. I've added two in between those two charts.


[25-Mar-25 11:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have an FP base on SE-110a making DW, and a RIG base on ISA making H2O, but i cant produce enough H2O to supply my DW fully, what other things are good to make on a FP planet that I could do to supliment some part of my DW productionc to allow for some small excess of H2O?


[25-Mar-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
I was thinking IVP, but those are bloody expensive, and the PPA and NS needed to run the MTP recipie are at all time highs


[25-Mar-25 11:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
One option could be using the PG recipe for DW if you’re not already


[25-Mar-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, but i dont see a point in that when I could be making just as much DW + something else on the side


[25-Mar-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
Just dunno what that something else should be


[25-Mar-25 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
You could buy some CAF and make COF


[25-Mar-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
And btw the difference in my production and usage of H2O is not very big, just ~400 per day, so Im just looking for something small


[25-Mar-25 11:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
or buy inputs to make RATs, if you wanted to go that route


[25-Mar-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh yeah maybe, il check that out on prunplanner later


[25-Mar-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000

[25-Mar-25 11:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
it'd probably be hard to do on a large scale, but it should be possible just to keep a few FP busy full time


[25-Mar-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
To buy the COF you mean?


[25-Mar-25 11:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
CAF but yeah 😄


[25-Mar-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah alr


[25-Mar-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
That should be an easy solution then


[25-Mar-25 11:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
Iirc COF has simmilar profit to DW (?) So not too small of a loss


[25-Mar-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
Maybe


[25-Mar-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000

[25-Mar-25 11:37 AM] allocater#0000
for FP, MEA and FIM are the top profit atm


[25-Mar-25 11:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, im already making FIM at my first FP base, and I have no way of getting MTP for MEA without blasting 1 mil on some IVP that I cant use cuz NS and PPA markets are cooked


[25-Mar-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
So for now buying CAF to make into COF is my best choice


[25-Mar-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think


[25-Mar-25 11:46 AM] allocater#0000
PPA can't be such a problem, it's just BEA and water


[25-Mar-25 12:01 PM] superbadsounds#0000
If you end up making MTP, I'd suggest making your own PPA as well. It's draw from your FP time, but it means you won't have to be reliant on a low volume market.


[25-Mar-25 12:03 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Then you just have to figure out a solution for NS, which is pretty simple to make. I wouldn't be surprised if someone in corp has a decent price on it, but don't hold me to that.. I just buy mine at CX prices


[25-Mar-25 08:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
I can provide NS cheaper than CX


[25-Mar-25 08:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have ~400/d NS production. Pretty small but CX has shortage right now


[26-Mar-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Would anyone be interested in some form of "sourcing" service? Like if someone needs a certain material as input for their base, but its not available on their CX, I would go out and buy+ship from other CX's to make that material available on their prefered CX?


[26-Mar-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
It sounds fun for me, but idk if anyone actually needs smt like that


[26-Mar-25 01:56 PM] bookliko#0000

[26-Mar-25 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think you could maybe do something similar, but offering planet deliveries. Various people have done weekly consumable deliveries and that worked well until they burned out


[26-Mar-25 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
but like CX to CX is a bit tougher. since it's rare for ANT to be missing something regularly and also have a case where someone is willing to wait for another person's ship.. when they could send their own


[26-Mar-25 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
probably easiser to stock the CX in that case

If IDC gets nerfed, I will swap malahat to do the whole WAI chain I think


[11-Apr-25 04:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Anyone has an efficient base layout(s) for WAI production?

10 SD, 3 SE, 3 SL... 5 HB3, 1 HB4, 1 HB5. I guess?

[11-Apr-25 08:56 PM] evov#0000
I have plenty of spare WAI - I'll post it on the CX if/when people actually start buying it.


[11-Apr-25 09:03 PM] evov#0000
About 100k/WAI is the price region where I'd make WAI to sell rather than IDC's.

I was actually looking at making a tool to figure this out based on the rates it has in game. Kinda like [satisfactory tools](https://www.satisfactorytools.com/1.0/production) for satisfactory giving out put in items/time and being able to set targets as such as too

Mathmatically I can do it by hand, but I am just trying to figure out how to do it so it looks nice


[12-Apr-25 12:19 PM] evov#0000
I've been looking more closely at the new consumable packages. Just wondering if anyone here is getting involved in them, or has any interest in either producing or buying them.


[12-Apr-25 12:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Pretty useless for me


[12-Apr-25 12:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
I most likely wont purchase any, unless im very lazy one day


[12-Apr-25 12:35 PM] evov#0000
I assume this depends on price? Is there a price difference where it would make sense to you? What if they were only 1% more expensive? 5%, 10% etc. I suspect everyone would use them if the price was the same as buying the consumes individually.


[12-Apr-25 12:41 PM] pagy1234#0000
well if the price ever gets that low then I would probably buy them, but currently it doesnt look likely that it will


[12-Apr-25 12:43 PM] pagy1234#0000
it also seems like only "Newton 17" is producing any bundles at all, they are the only person with any stock of bundles, albeit a very small amount


[12-Apr-25 12:45 PM] evov#0000
I'm not producing any yet either. My initial thoughts were that they're not really worth it. But, I spent a bit of time diving into the numbers a bit more, and there are parts of it that could be interesting.

Less so for the pioneer bundles, but the other 4 look pretty viable from where I'm sitting.


[12-Apr-25 12:47 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, for PIO's theres no money to be made because the margin is non existant, but if I heard correctly, the 550k of supplies needed for 1 bundle, but only ~10k of packaging makes the scientist bundles decent


[12-Apr-25 12:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
Good for people who can make bundles themselves insuring that they sell all of their products in one go


[12-Apr-25 12:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
Not permit efficient


[12-Apr-25 12:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
It’s not going to be “make 50/k per day” kind of base


[12-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah thats something i mentioned in the offical chat a while back, forces something like PWO to have more consistent liquidity


[12-Apr-25 12:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
for bundles above the PIO ones it could very well be


[12-Apr-25 12:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
Would be pretty funny if devs make that you can only consume bundles 😅


[12-Apr-25 12:53 PM] evov#0000
One of the "projects" that I'm working on, is trying to build up a decent reserve of critical materials to help prevent the ANT CX from running dry. At the moment that effort is mostly limited to consumables. Being able to limit the stock items from like 24 different consumables, down to 5 makes a meaningful difference to my time/effort/capital invested.


[12-Apr-25 12:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah that will definitely help with shortages


[12-Apr-25 12:56 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah thats something that packages would be pretty useful for


[12-Apr-25 12:57 PM] pagy1234#0000
having the packages you also allow you to throw them on the market more easily aswell


[12-Apr-25 01:00 PM] evov#0000
Combining multiple materials also adds to price stability in general, so it's easier set and maintain prices for longer periods and not have to update prices as frequently ( which is an anoying time sink imo )

{Reactions}
💯 

[12-Apr-25 01:02 PM] evov#0000
So yea, if anyone is interested in getting involved in this market... either producing the packages or supplying the raw consumables in bulk to produce them, hit me up.

I don't have any plans or spare permits right now, just trying to get a feel for the interest/ potential involvement people might have.


[12-Apr-25 01:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
I can see that people will start using them for convenience and we will get some competition. As soon as they become more or less close to what the prices of individual item, we will see the increase for demand


[12-Apr-25 01:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
Spreading margins of agro products with manufacturing products will help with pricing


[12-Apr-25 01:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
But again it’s only good (at least what I think) for people who can make everything themselves


[12-Apr-25 01:17 PM] evov#0000
I have very limited production of consumables. There's a handful I make decent amount of, but not many. I do however buy/stockpile a lot already for my personal use and the above mentioned project I'm working on. So it's not a big transition for me to go from holding onto lots of consumes -> converting them into packages.

For reference - current consume stock I currently hold at CX warehouses

[13-Apr-25 08:08 AM] bookliko#0000
How about introducing unpackaged goods to start degrading/spoiling? This would simulate real life circumstances and provide a valuable incentive to buy packaged for established players.
Degradation could be a percentage of the stock per week with different rates per MAT.
This would also disincentivize hording, unless packaged.
Newer players would not suffer as much due to the small stocks and quick turnarounds. One could also introduce a X month grace period for new players.

how high does MEA have to go before you activate the strategic reserves? 😄


[13-Apr-25 02:29 PM] allocater#0000
I would buy CBU, because I can LM shipping contract them easily from CXs to Malahat.


[13-Apr-25 06:15 PM] evov#0000
I think I've got about 2000 MEA on the ANT CX right now. So about 30% of my MEA storage is on the ANT CX at the moment. As long as ANT isn't the most expensive CX I don't feel compelled to keep pushing the price lower.

Yea, I think the consumer packages sound super helpful for base supply through the LM. I'm leaning towards doing it... just need to figuire out which base to demolish so I've got a permit to use 🙂


[14-Apr-25 09:50 AM] allocater#0000

@everyone  New MM prices are coming, with a big reduction to IDC / EDC: 

```
    ADR: 58000 → 70000

    CBS: 42000 → 42000
    CC: 370000 → 650000
    CCD: 61000 → 80000
    CRU: 185000 → 200000
    EDC: 11100 → 8000 (over the course of 4 weeks)
    FFC: 185000 → 240000
    IDC : 15300 → 11000 (over the course of 4 weeks)

    WR: 61000 → 100000
```
We'll have to revisit the per-base income chart since these aren't exactly what were advocating for.  Suffice to say, big changes are afoot in the PRUN economy and this will really shift around a lot of things for everyone.

I think there isn't something you can just throw scientists at. A lot of these take WAI, but you need a lot of supporting SD and SE for your SLs when making WAI


[14-Apr-25 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also there's a shitstorm in the PRUN discord general chat. I think there's a small  handful of people who are extremely butthurt about IDC getting nerfed because it's the only thing they make, so they are gonna be grumpy, and we can let them vent at the devs and lowstrife or whatever they need to do.

these are the profit per area, "whole chain" numbers


[14-Apr-25 03:28 PM] melon164#0000
What was IDC before?


[14-Apr-25 03:40 PM] cptboby#0000
omg 46 steps


[14-Apr-25 03:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Using the same measure, it was previously $178,931


[14-Apr-25 05:49 PM] evov#0000
A quick look at the numbers - roughly....
IDC/EDC aren't worth making unless consume prices get a LOT cheaper.
I think AIR is likely the most profitable. Which will put upward pressure on all the things that go into it ( a lot of low/mid tier items in that chain will be "worth" more... consequences are that other low/mid tier items made by the same buildings will also get more expensive imo )
A number of drone products are also looking quite good.
Drones draw from a good amount of electronics, but also chemistry and manufacturing planets.

There's a few unchanged MM's ( capacitor banks, LOG ) that are more attractive, if only for the reason that the juiciest fruit got nerfed, so the baseline expectation for Area Profitability is lower now.

It's half the clicks too! and it dismisses the messages faster somehow


[14-Apr-25 09:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
I kinda view this as an indication that the devs really do care about QoL but are stretched too thin to do much atm - I doubt this would have gotten approved a year ago when PMMG introduced action packages


[14-Apr-25 09:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, all things said, I think they really do listen to the players and try to understand where we are at


[14-Apr-25 09:32 PM] archielvahr#0000

[15-Apr-25 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I turned almost all of it into VG eventually


[15-Apr-25 03:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
I’ve got some spare permits and I am looking into more chem products to make. I make EPO / REA / TCL / DDT / NS


[15-Apr-25 03:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
Might just increase what I already make


[15-Apr-25 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think those are all pretty good. OLF is nice for governors. We might still bein a MED shortage


[15-Apr-25 03:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
If I am gonna go for MED i will have to mix it with something aswell since it can be pretty costly to make without selling whole lot


[15-Apr-25 03:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
how are we on IND and BLE?


[15-Apr-25 03:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
We definitely don’t need more TCL and REA, making OLF is at the loss since I don’t govern


[15-Apr-25 03:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
Probably don’t need more DDT since more people jumping on it


[15-Apr-25 03:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
NS feels pretty stable


[15-Apr-25 03:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
So more EPO or start on PG production since it will rise soon


[15-Apr-25 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
IND and BLE are both pretty small quantities


[15-Apr-25 03:28 PM] akyantor#0000
I suspect MED will be in demand for a while given such a large producer dropped out.


[16-Apr-25 06:22 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Time to think about shutting down EDC bases on Malahat then?


[16-Apr-25 06:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
at a minimum, we might as well keep them until close to 5/5 - I think that's when the changes start to become effective. I think allocater said the IDC bases are still profitable (but less so), but EDC might be in the red


[16-Apr-25 06:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think the EDC is _technically_ in the red now, but that's just because all of the profits go to OOG bank interest and the secretary atm


[16-Apr-25 06:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
so we could cut the secretary pay in half and maybe drop the bank interest rate a bit and it'd still make money overall/ but the 'profit/week' figure is really just what ends up in allocater's pocket after everything else gets paid out so it's up to them imo


[16-Apr-25 06:34 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That's fair.  We just repaired my EDC base too, so might as well use it until it starts to degrade


[16-Apr-25 06:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
And print everyone as much cash as possible in the meantime 😄


[16-Apr-25 06:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Between multi-contracts, consumable packages, and the new MMs, there might be interesting opportunities for a new co-op project too, if the data core printers end up not making sense

EDC bases technically make 60k/day. Not sure if you want to spend a permit on this *in this economy* 😉 but for sure there are no profits to be distributed among multiple people anymore. I am still calculating though.

what do you produce on Norwick? Would you consider adding MTP production?


[20-Apr-25 03:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
I make FIM rn


[20-Apr-25 03:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn, MTP is the one that needs IVP's


[20-Apr-25 03:37 AM] pagy1234#0000

[20-Apr-25 03:37 AM] allocater#0000
yup


[20-Apr-25 03:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
how much are you looking for?


[20-Apr-25 03:39 AM] allocater#0000
I would buy up to 50 per day, so that's about half the base if you want to re-tool that much 😄


[20-Apr-25 03:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
IVP are damn expensive tho, and Im 50% sure I lose a chunk of profit by doing that.


[20-Apr-25 03:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
I dont think thats something I have the budget for rn though. I am looking moreso to build a new base for something

[21-Apr-25 12:17 PM] akyantor#0000
Anyone have any kind of general rule of thumb when calculating building degredation cost? *i.e. some percentage of building cost per day/hour.*


[21-Apr-25 12:18 PM] akyantor#0000
I've build something a while ago that calcuates the cost of each material that I produce that factors in pop consumables + taxes, but want to expand it to include building degredation.. seems complex though.


[21-Apr-25 12:20 PM] akyantor#0000
It looks like you might assume you roughly repair half the material cost of the building every 60 days. So could split half that cost across 60 days worth of run time to get something very rough.


[21-Apr-25 12:28 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Is this different from what prun planner does?


[21-Apr-25 12:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's how it's usually calculated. I believe that's what prunplanner does. Not sure if it's 60 days or 90 days or what.


[21-Apr-25 01:16 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm trying to calculate the true cost of the e2e chain to build products across multiple bases, so similar but different.


[21-Apr-25 03:18 PM] akyantor#0000
Nice, crudely added it... makes a massive difference when you have higher tiered buildings in the E2E chain.


[22-Apr-25 12:55 AM] allocater#0000
it's half the cost in 90 days. There are certain spikes when the integers round up, I tracked it here for SL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit?gid=1713145483#gid=1713145483

[24-Apr-25 11:46 AM] evov#0000
Usually I just buy stuff at other CX's and ship it back to ANT. Because a lot of my income is from selling ships, and I accept any currency... I'll go through random periods where I have more CIS or NCC than I can hope to spend. If I have to.... I'll use that currency to buy Bfabs from their exchange and ship it back to ANT. 2 birds with 1 stone.... I get stuff I need, and I'm removing currency of a rival region from the game.

[24-Apr-25 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you want to unload foreign currencies for free, go to malahat and buy IDC at cost, then convert them to AIC


[24-Apr-25 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
works well for the >10m range


[24-Apr-25 11:55 AM] evov#0000
Deleted my IDC bases ( or in the process of deleting them )


[24-Apr-25 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also., don't forget to sell all your IDC in the next couple weeks


[24-Apr-25 11:56 AM] evov#0000
Plus, the range I'm usually looking to shed is a bit above the 10mil bracket


[24-Apr-25 11:56 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm actually kind of looking forward to not feeling obliged to use some permits for IDC, as you were just leaving money on the table before if you didn't have at least one.


[24-Apr-25 11:56 AM] akyantor#0000
Will be fun to find something more interesting to use the permits for...


[24-Apr-25 11:57 AM] evov#0000
I had 2 IDC bases... already deleted one. Letting the other one just run out it's normal 60 day cycle time. I'll de-construct when I would otherwise be going out to resupply it.


[24-Apr-25 11:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'll probably convert one to WAI, not sure about my second one though


[24-Apr-25 12:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am ending up with a lot of MEA 😅


[24-Apr-25 12:05 PM] evov#0000
I'm tempted to rip out a lot of my NON ant region bases. . . . BUT .. one of them is Promitor. Even though it's one of my least profitable planets, I'm not sure if I have the heart to kill it off.


[24-Apr-25 12:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m probably gonna keep my IDC bases - they’re profitable for now, and I’m guessing all the people getting out of IDC will make the inputs cheaper 😄


[24-Apr-25 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
But gotta second @akyantor on that - I love that you actually have a choice to do IDC or not, instead of leaving money on the table


[24-Apr-25 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I’d like to see more intermediate products on the CX


[26-Apr-25 09:43 AM] evov#0000
I think it works out to be 1 AWF needed per ship. If people are planning to do batches of 200 ships, I might have to think about getting into a different industry.


[26-Apr-25 09:45 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I listed 200 more on CX


[26-Apr-25 09:46 AM] evov#0000
Maybe people are just jumping on it because it's priced as "a good deal". No intention to use it, just plan to sell it for more later.


[26-Apr-25 10:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Doesn’t AWF go into LIS which was one of the more profitable new MM products that got adjusted?


[26-Apr-25 10:10 AM] evov#0000
It is. But Im not convinced that LIS will be worth selling to the MM at the price listed.


[26-Apr-25 10:11 AM] evov#0000
I guess if people can take advantage of cheap AWF on the CX it starts to make a lot more sense 🙂


[26-Apr-25 10:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
LIS got bumped up a little, but I didn't see the new results.

Balancing Changes to MMs, POPI and alt. recipes (May 5th, 2025)
Sorry, that could have been clearer. It’s just an export of all the MMs so they were included. I marked them as “unchanged” in the patch notes now.  In other news:   Increased WR and LIS MMs a bit more Added a section on POPI changes that we are planning to implement with the same update Added a couple recipe changes we will also sneak in

I don't quite understand the difference and use of a Corp HQ and a Company HQ and permit count..

[28-Apr-25 08:44 PM] swatacular#0000
Company HQ:
Does location just give a flat boost to all production on planet?
Is relocating free?


[28-Apr-25 08:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
* CORP HQ gives a 10% production boost
* Company HQ location determines permit boost type and where to take mats for HQ upgrades
* permit count affects the boost you get from your company HQ location


[28-Apr-25 08:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Relocating your Company Hq is free but you can only do it once a month


[28-Apr-25 08:46 PM] swatacular#0000
How is boost type defined?


[28-Apr-25 08:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[28-Apr-25 08:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So which faction


[28-Apr-25 08:46 PM] swatacular#0000

[28-Apr-25 08:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No company wide

[28-Apr-25 08:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[28-Apr-25 08:48 PM] marat_sh#0000

Is anyone else interested in making an AIR base? I'd love to get more players involved.


[29-Apr-25 12:42 AM] allocater#0000
I have 6 APF on heph which probably will mostly produce AIR after the change. So I will buy the inputs for it, but also would contribute to additional AIR production


[29-Apr-25 01:59 AM] evov#0000
I have 18 APF's running at the moment. Not currently using them for any MM stuff, but that might change in the future. My new "MM play" is towards making drones. Mostly because it's a chunky section of the game I haven't done anything in before, so it seems interesting.


[29-Apr-25 02:00 AM] evov#0000
I think there's a lot of people looking at making AIR. I hope they're not planning to buy all the inputs from the CX... as that likely won't work out well.

BAC is pretty simple to make


[29-Apr-25 07:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
bought like 1k S recently

One of the outcomes of lots of people suddenly wanting to make AIR I'm guessing?


[30-Apr-25 10:29 AM] swatacular#0000
BAC has always been in limited supply on the market. Probably because its simple to make


[30-Apr-25 10:31 AM] marat_sh#0000
Same as MED


[30-Apr-25 10:31 AM] marat_sh#0000
Super easy to overproduce


[30-Apr-25 10:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
I will ramp up my BAC production to just post massive bulk


[30-Apr-25 10:32 AM] swatacular#0000

I always figured BAC was short cause people have other things to do with  their LAB time. I usually buy mine on the CX.


[30-Apr-25 12:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah TCL and DDT were main focus


[30-Apr-25 07:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I wonder how many AIR bases one BAC base can support


[30-Apr-25 07:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
so 1 BAC base can output ~80/d


[30-Apr-25 07:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
1 AIR is like what... 5-6 BAC/d?
