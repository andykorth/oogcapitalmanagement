**MadMonk21**:	do you have any interest in helping to build a LM and/or WAR here?


[16-Nov-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I have been thinking it might be helpful to at least have a LM here to help with shipping and such


[28-Nov-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	oh ah yea^^


[28-Nov-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	sorry i dont really check the chats in game that often. an lm cost quite a bit but not that much^^ i might take a look how expensive it is when i have time. i do have some left over money and also have like 200000 NCC in tio on planet i cant get shipped^^


[28-Nov-21 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no worries. I already built the LM here so use it if you want! Working on the WAR here as well, so that'll be up and running in a few weeks probably


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	well if u should need LST SIO or TIO tell me then^^ i could make u some and exspecially tio i could sell under MM at like 60 NCC screw it lets say 50 NCC currently^^ have too much of it anyways^^(doubt u need much tho^^ but if u wanna buy it ship it to lm and make some money from it u are free to^^


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'll keep that in mind, thanks!


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm looking to try and expand here a bit, but can't seem to track any HSE down right now


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	u say the hse is the issue ;? how much would u need?


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	looking for 14 units


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	would repair my current stuff and allow expansion


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	if you have a source for it or know someone who could help out, that would be awesome


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	Well the thing is, i have a huge Excel where everyone in our clan puts in the things one need for upgrades/repairs and new Bases.


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	its where i got my HSE from and like 2-3 weeks ago i got 5 more to repair my EXT.


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	i guess i could either see who made them or see if i might be able to requisition some


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	any help you could give would be awesome, but you don't have to go out of your way for it


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	i will see if i can get some^^ that cost something over 7k per unit tho^^


[30-Nov-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that's not a problem, I figured they'd be pricier


[01-Dec-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	i put up an order for 19 HSE (i will keep 5 for repairs)


[01-Dec-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	someone accepted the request. cant tell u how long exactly it will take. i will then eventually ship them here from valli


[01-Dec-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	sounds great, when you get them just let me know how much for them. I appreciate it!


[01-Dec-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	alright^^


[01-Dec-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	so if i needed some I know where to get it?


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	would you sell directly on the LM?


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	sure why not


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	sounds good!


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I extract a bit of TIO, but I may come to you if I need a bigger order at some point


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	im literally running out of space^^ which is why i have to send one of my ships here^^


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I have the rest of the mats here on planet for my expansion, so just let me know when the HSE gets here

**dominikhue**:	i have arrived with the HSE


[11-Dec-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	yeah there are now 3!


[24-Mar-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yo


[24-Mar-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I'll be bringing a CoGC and SST soon, hoping to not take to many PIO this next PoPR tho. I don't think I'll have the SST built by then either sadly


[24-Mar-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm going to drop a few more EXT, about 180 more PIO for me


[24-Mar-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I can provide MCG on planet if you need at all


[25-Mar-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	That's what I'm going to make lol


[25-Mar-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	it's going to be a Manu CoGC


[25-Mar-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	so yea adjust properly


[25-Mar-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	i'm going to be swimming in mcg


[25-Mar-22 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	alright^^ i will also drop some more EXT then. i can make tio or lst and sio with those^^ whatever is needed love. ;P


[25-Mar-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	will likely also regulary ship between this place and vallis/CX as soon as my 2k/2k ship is build eventually^^ (probably take a while i just put myself into a list i think)


[25-Mar-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	ok, I got the CoGC and SST coming but it won't make it before PoPR


[25-Mar-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	also could one of you two toss in the MCG needed for the SST?


[25-Mar-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I didn't quite have enough on my base where my ship is flying from


[25-Mar-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	done


[25-Mar-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	thanks


[25-Mar-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no problem


[26-Mar-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hmm i actually lost jobs this report


[26-Mar-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Sorry, hopefully it doesn't hurt you too bad, SST and CoGC will be built later today when me ship lands (8-9 hours)


[26-Mar-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	hopefully the CoGC makes up for the efficiency loss you have right now


[26-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	it should all come back


[26-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	thinking RE for bonus?


[26-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	the CoGC? no, want to go Manu


[26-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	first week is PIO tho


[26-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Manu is even better fo rme!


[26-Mar-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	for me!


[27-Mar-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dominikhue**:	eh i guess it will be indirectly good for me. when i eventually build more EXT u might buy lst and sio from me.


[28-Mar-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	MCG.NC1 come on pioneers grow faster :(


[09-Apr-22 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	was debating on building a WAR here, any idea what WAR fees would be like since we don't have an ADM to set them?


[03-May-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	was trying to decide if it could be nice to be able to sell stuff or ship stuff here a bit more easily with a WAR for people to use


[04-May-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	That's up to you, I'm quiting the game, so you will have to supply the CoGC from now on.


[04-May-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	and the WAR fees should be zero


[04-May-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	ah, fair enough

[06-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	It's odd that I can contribute but can't vote. I don't understand that decision by the devs


[06-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that does seem a bit odd


[15-Jul-22 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Hey MadMonk can you vote for Manu again? We got 2 days


[16-Jul-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Does MemoryAlpha have a deal with any of you for the MCG on the LM? or can I take it?


[18-Jul-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Tobold, unless you get a benefit from the CoGC you don't need to contribute. I'll handle it. but I it would be awesome if you could keep voting for Manu.


[18-Jul-22 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	no deal with me at all


[19-Jul-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lovehungusall**:	We don't need it yet. We only need 2 SST upkeep till we get to 8450 Pioneers. now that someone else joined us.


[08-Aug-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	also not sure why the INF was built. We won't need it for a very long time


[08-Aug-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	If we stay at 9 bases, the one SST can keep 11800 Pioneers 100% happy


[08-Aug-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	how do you calculate what population you can support with each level and building?

**Lovehungusall**:	Can't really share it since it does have other stuff attached that we don't want others seeing.


[08-Aug-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that's fair


[08-Aug-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	would be good for me to spend some time looking at the handbook info


[08-Aug-22 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Liquidator**:	Don't pioneers need health too? (to a lesser extent than settlers)


[09-Aug-22 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	They only get 15% of their needs from health


[09-Aug-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	75% comes from life support and safety


[09-Aug-22 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	I'm at 540 pioneers current, out of 560 needed. Not sure what I could contribute to make population grow faster.


[09-Aug-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Liquidator**:	Wouldn't that added 15% help with faster growth? Even if it's just 15% faster?


[09-Aug-22 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Yes and no. The displayed happiness is the weighted average of the last 5 weeks of true happiness. The most recent true happiness counts as 40%, the previous week counts as 25%, the one before that as 20%, then 10%, then 5%. So if the weekly "true happiness" is already at 100%, there's nothing you can do short of an ADM to buy happiness directly.


[09-Aug-22 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Population growth and happiness is a complicated mechanic, but figuring it out is pretty fun.


[09-Aug-22 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Liquidator**:	Figuring it out was part of the plan when investing in that INF. Current pioneer happiness is 82.5%, so there it shouldn't be totally useless.


[09-Aug-22 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	And then it would take 5 weeks of maintaining that for us to reach 100% (although after 3 weeks we'd be most of the way there)


[09-Aug-22 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	So if you *really* want more pios, then yeah, supply 1 of those components


[09-Aug-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	With no open jobs / no unemployment, and no health buys, we should gain ~1130 pios. If we supply at least 1 component for the INF, we should end up with another ~1335


[09-Aug-22 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	*not 1335 additional, but 1335 total new pios.


[09-Aug-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Liquidator**:	If did put some OFF/STR/TUB into the INF. Just not sure why the "next consumption" is 0, and it says "current 0".


[09-Aug-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tobold**:	Yeah, I posted about that on the forums, but nobody knew.


[09-Aug-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Yeah, it's awkward first setting it up. It'll kick in.


[09-Aug-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Oh no, my math was wrong. With the health and 0 open jobs / 0 unemployment, we should gain ~1065


[09-Aug-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Had an error in the safety station from 3 weeks ago.

[02-Sep-22 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I can take it cheap if you want to just offload some of it. Or I have had decent luck with public shipping from here to MOR, I do 10k a load


[02-Sep-22 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Messerjack**:	Hello long-term neighbors who I don't know yet :-) Tell me which building I have to fill in order to hire a few settlers here soon. Is that the infamy? I'm not in a hurry, but the main thing is that they come at all.


[25-May-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Hmm so I believe part of it goes back to "build it and they will come". There has to be demand in order for the PIOs to be educated up.


[25-May-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	How many you wanting?


[25-May-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Bleb, miscalculated MCG for repairs. I need 60, does somebody have some spare laying around, or do I have to ship that in on the next run?


[25-May-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Messerjack**:	finally I need 180 settlers @hhillman


[26-May-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Aaand I need another 3 MCG because of course the buildings degraded another MCG worth of tick by the time the LM ad was finally filled XD

[19-Oct-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-23 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I think we should change the COGC cause there are plenty of resources a day to be pulled


[25-Oct-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	But idk what to do. Chem? Manufacturing? Construction? Wish there was FEO or ALO in that system


[25-Oct-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think it would take a good bit of persuasion to push it off of Resource Extraction, I personally would be fine with Resource Extraction, Manufacturing, or Pioneers, but I don't speak for everyone here.


[25-Oct-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Well there's metallurgy next door, and frost is pumping out H20 and C. Then there's the other one starting agriculture for the HYP


[25-Oct-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	So that gas planet can be food industries and this one should compliment what is needed most after that


[25-Oct-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	I'm good with resource extraction here since it supports metallurgy on Titan. Specifically tio to ti


[25-Oct-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	For me personally if it switched I could easily build more to compensate since this base just supports me. But I'm pretty sure there are others here supporting multiple people's bases on Titan.


[25-Oct-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I like resource extraction due to the great SIO and LST amounts here, make a whole lot of MCG with it


[25-Oct-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But obviously, worse comes to worse I can throw down a few more EXTs


[25-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BaxterPierogis**:	Do you guys just extract or do you do mcg as an end product on this base?


[25-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I'm running 5 EXT, and 11 BMP here - all for MCG


[25-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BaxterPierogis**:	I would stick with resources extraction as the COG


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Either way you have it, if it comes to MCG, Resource Extraction is the most beneficial


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Currently have it all refined here, but when I get more ships I'll have it directed towards Circa to refine there :]


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Circa and Circe are great planets


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Agreed!


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Alright yea that works. I was wondering what everyone else thought cause I know resources here are easy to get regardless of the bonus


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I'm cool sticking with it if it helps most of us here :)


[25-Oct-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Now what about more warehouse space? I can try for that if we think it'll help us


[25-Oct-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	RE for COGC is why i am here for EXT and INC. We have started "C" for Ag to push HYF production and move to "A" for the INC. Having moved off planets that decided to flip COGC i will do my level best to maximize my vote here for RE as it makes the most sense.


[25-Oct-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	yeah, RE all the way


[25-Oct-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	we got quite a big setup going for TI in system which Crash is supporting with his C plant in system


[25-Oct-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Hmm so even more INC? never thought of that


[25-Oct-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed INC is RE, just need to have the HYF to feed it all lol and thats taking its sweet time to get rolling on "C"


[25-Oct-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Well I do plan on getting on all of the others here eventually. I can help you on C if needed


[25-Oct-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I'm back to a point where i make about half the needed consumption, and still have about 5k in stock. I will be slapping down the next bunch of INC just before POPR in hopes of pulling all the pop i need, it will be close i think.


[25-Oct-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Once its all filled with pop i will be grand lol

**Vasyklo**:	Ahh okay I see. But what about frost you are full?


[25-Oct-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Growing frost as i need so i'm not exporting tons of water out, Just what i need on "C" and Verdant


[25-Oct-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Even though i have 10 ships, they never have much time stopped lol, 2 WCB, 7 LCB and 1 STL LCB in Bastion


[25-Oct-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea thats my plan on frost too. I always need Carbon. LCB here is a good idea cause of water


[25-Oct-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	10 ships thats nuts I have 3 lol one stl


[26-Oct-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yo Crash that was nice dropping those SSTs. I should be able to supply the OFF for it


[26-Oct-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Should be enough upkeep for the happiness to still be over 70%

[26-Oct-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	This is with just OFF in SST and OFF/TUB in INF. Seems to be enough to keep growing


[27-Oct-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	If someone has a couple hundred MCG to put into the INF that will make another level for it as well, i am out lol


[27-Oct-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeed


[27-Oct-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BaxterPierogis**:	I put up a local market ad


[29-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Gotcha! Might want to consider an STO here :]


[29-Oct-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	14 EXT and 2 STO seems to work well enough for me on other planets.


[29-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Ya I have 2 here its pretty solid


[29-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Was thinking of upgrading the warehouse too


[29-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea actually I can do one upgrade next round trip


[30-Oct-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Oh lol yea that'll help. I was curious cause I took a 2 day detour and overproduced XD


[30-Oct-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	well, i underestimated the production rate of 10 EXT here xd. (4500 every 8 days is a bit hectic considering that it would take me 8 days to ship all that back to MOR)


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	hmmm....


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yes


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	So I reduced my production and added GF so get rid of the extra SIO lol. If you need shipping I finally caught up


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	It'll be about 2days before I'll leave here with probably half a WCB

[08-Dec-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Glad we're a back up plan ;]


[08-Dec-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I found 2 planets with higher concentrations of LST and SIO, but there was not enough supply of TSH in the universe to turn that into a reality :/


[08-Dec-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	This should be good enough


[23-Dec-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I contributed RATs and DW if anyone has some PE


[23-Dec-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Dec-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Dec-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I queued up RATs and DW for this cycle to make sure it doesn't happen again so soon :]

[26-Dec-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	ive got 3700 LST, 500 SIO and 1600 TIO just sitting here cause my two ships cant keep up right now lol


[26-Dec-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	guess its time to make another ship then


[26-Dec-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	If you need some space, I make MCG here and could buy some of that LST and SIO from you (2:1). Send me CONTS anytime if you need to.


[26-Dec-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	oh, I mean if you want it then sure, but i will eventually use it anyway i guess, also only have basic so cant send cont


[28-Dec-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Lol Hunt kinda glad you are able to keep up with LST now but sorry its so much and out of the way :P


[29-Dec-23 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	would be pretty good as C is agriculture for HYF


[03-Mar-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You'd probably have to have a chat with or compete against the residents there


[03-Mar-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	One of the people voting for metallurgy is Schaitr :p


[03-Mar-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But there's five bases there, all listed as Metallurgy all right around +150d old bases


[03-Mar-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**illuineru**:	Hi Bezborg.


[20-Jun-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Hey guys, found this chat finally!


[20-Jun-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'm your new neighbour


[20-Jun-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Just landed on Bastion a, plopping a full 3-permit base. I do LST extraction excusively, aiming to be the #1 LST producer


[20-Jun-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I apologize for the inconvenience of redistributing the workforce, but I'm here for the long haul, and I will support the planet 's infrastructure


[20-Jun-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I will need your help though, to teach me how to do that. I don't really get the upkeeps, any help with that is appreciated


[20-Jun-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Once my base is up and running, I will likely have to move LST to Moria CX daily, using both my WCB ships... I will be happy to help you haul back anything you need, as my ships will mostly be returning empty, apart from the occasional top ups of consumables


[20-Jun-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	bastion a is my only base for the moment, I'm keeping the starter Montem base but it's empty. I'm 100% focusing on my LST operation here.


[20-Jun-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	once u get the workforce u will never lose it unless u demolish HB1s.


[20-Jun-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Oh so pop infrastructure upkeep is irrelevant once you fill up?


[20-Jun-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	afaik yes.


[20-Jun-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	But it will be needed if we have to attract new pioneers to the planet, as there's not enough for all of us?


[20-Jun-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Or just upgrading the infrastructure is good enough?


[20-Jun-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	I really dont know. Never fiddled with it. Im also new to the planet insfracture.


[20-Jun-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Do we have any corporate HQ on Bastion a? I was planning on building my own HQ, but no point if there's already a corp with an HQ here


[20-Jun-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	POPI maintains the population level, you can look at POPR XG-326a for more info on it


[20-Jun-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Currently we have a bit over 1000 unemployed PIO's, so if you're doing a 1k base (2k PIO's?) we'll need more PIO growth - it'll catch up on it's own after a while but it's not a good idea to have that low a PIO buffer.


[20-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	My base will be 1800 PIO capacity in 24hrs


[20-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Population growth is partly determined by the safety, health, etc you can see on the POPR


[20-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	So how do we handle it?


[20-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	We can fill the POPI that improves Safety and Health, so the SST and INF in POPI XG-326a


[20-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I've already put some spare OFF into those, should help enough but we'll see after the next POPR how it's going


[20-Jun-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'll help any way I can, this is my new home, just need your guidance


[20-Jun-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Basically if pops are reaching low unemployment, throw some DW or OFF into those buildings, and the next POPR you'll see growth on them. There's a lot more to it than that, but thats the basics


[20-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Moving base wrecked me financially but still got an 800k buffer


[20-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	No worries, appreciate you asking about it - normally planets have a governor that takes care of it but we're on our own here unless someone builds an ADM


[20-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	How does one build an ADM?


[20-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The LST deposits here will definitely bring in good money for you :D


[20-Jun-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	ADM is about 500k+, you can find it on the PPS XG-326a screen


[20-Jun-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	LST market has been a bit low lately (at one point it was 300 per unit - this is why I can make this exodus from Montem after only 2 months)


[20-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	ahem, 850k+ for an ADM. It's been a while since I've checked those prices it seems.


[20-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	500k ain't that bad...


[20-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Oh ok


[20-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	second adjustment I realise thats our internal corp prices, so 1M+...


[20-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Still, doable... if we build one, then what? Thwere's an AI governor that handles population from the fees?


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Or it needs to be a player


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	We don't need it on a planet like this unless we reach muchlarger population count, or want TECH or higher from programs


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Human governor


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I see


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	they can run programs, adjust taxes, and use that to fund POPI upkeep


[20-Jun-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Well, as long as we all have full employment, I guess as you say, it's a barely populated world


[20-Jun-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, we should be fine once it's settled down from your base, but it'll be low unemployment for a while I'd guess.


[20-Jun-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Any corp HQ on the planet? I'd love to join if so. If not, I'll be working to build one as the next development priority


[20-Jun-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	You probably won't get full pops on POPR, but the week after you'll be fine. We'll just see how it goes and work from there


[20-Jun-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Not sure if any corps have a HQ here


[20-Jun-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Well maybe I'll be the first then, as soon as I can manage it


[20-Jun-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	It's about 2.5M for a corp HQ, so might want to wait a bit before looking at that ;)


[20-Jun-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'm not really scared of these numbers haha, I have nothing else to work towards. I'm just doing 100% LST


[20-Jun-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	hehe, good on you - if you're up to the logistics challenge that'll be great to see on the market. The LST market could defintiely use it too


[20-Jun-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Well when I get the workfroce up to speed, I'll make around 12k LST per week... That's without corp HQ and 5x resource extraction experts (that one will take time)... so with 12k LST per week, at, say, 150 per unit (which is a low estimate), that's 1.7mil per week, once it's all sold


[20-Jun-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Of course, I will likely oversatirate the market and screw it up, but who knows


[20-Jun-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Once all the bonuses ae up and running, I should be the #1 producer in the game, or close to it


[20-Jun-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Minus consumables and repairs costs (and we're a HSE planet here), but RE is pretty low on that front anyway.


[20-Jun-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Hopefully someone here has a corp HQ you can join so you can get that added in too


[20-Jun-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	That would be lovely :D


[20-Jun-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	How to get PRUN planner to include a faction bonus?


[20-Jun-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I have 6% res extr bonus that's not accounted for in PRUn planner


[20-Jun-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Oh nvm, it's in Empire faction settings


[20-Jun-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u gonna 3 permit base full of ext and extracting lst u need more than 2 WCB ship because u gonna print 2k lst per day with 5experts so heads up


[20-Jun-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Yep, 2.5k by my calculations.


[20-Jun-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	But 5 experts is a looong way away, I have time to figure it out


[20-Jun-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	(I caclulated with corp HQ bons as well)


[20-Jun-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	If I don't manage to get a third ship, I'll either give it away cheap, or scale down until I can expand the fleet


[20-Jun-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Needless to say if anyone on this planet needs LST for cheap, I'm happy to help out the neighbors


[20-Jun-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	my recommendation is 1 permit base for now 1permit is 1k LSt per day. then rump up production.


[20-Jun-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	1 have 4k LSt sitting here.


[20-Jun-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other thing to do is to get the adm center built and install a gov that can run programs.  PP p-XG-326a pp-ADM


[22-Jun-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	admin center built is a bit complicated, is it possible to raise the population without it?

**realbandit**:	Is it possible to raise popuation without government programs? Welcome to the "Back in my day, we had to bring population in using just POPI" segment.


[22-Jun-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Shagie's right, the 70% mark is the target, happiness is a moving average so it will take a few weeks, but it looks like we need some more upkeeps fed for now.


[22-Jun-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	So I went back to my old Pop growth models, and looks like we need just 1 upkeep for each SST and INF. So Keep DW topped on SST, and OFF on the INF. Just that, and Safety and Health should stay near 100%. That'll be plenty for PIO growth.


[22-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	We'll only need to get it above 70% for a short time too, depending how many excess PIO's we want.


[22-Jun-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Sounds good


[22-Jun-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rakkzi**:	oop yeah I'm missing 40 lol


[22-Jun-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Even if we get an ADM up, how long does it take before the first gov is actually able to run a program?


[22-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	if im not wrong its 3 days


[22-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	the first election start as soon as the ADM is built


[22-Jun-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	^


[22-Jun-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	So do we want to build an ADM?


[22-Jun-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Just depends if: A. Someone wants to make the ADM and B. If someone wants to be governor. -- Having a governor does help keeping the population more stable (especially if they know what they're doing...)


[22-Jun-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I don't mind, I only really have the bandwodth for one base (or one system, rather), and I made this my home... But it will take time to recover financually from the exodus to here


[22-Jun-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	What's the estimate, 2mil?


[22-Jun-24 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Let me check it out...


[22-Jun-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Currently on NC1 - It seems to roughly 1.1m NCC


[22-Jun-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Yeah i was just calculating myself, about 1.1k


[22-Jun-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	1.1m


[22-Jun-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I can do it, just need maybe 10-ish days


[22-Jun-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Do i get to name the planet hahah


[22-Jun-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sadly that's one of the supporter tier things


[22-Jun-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But I wouldn't be tooo surprised if this planet got named eventually


[22-Jun-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	3/5 of the planets in this system are named (the system also is lmao)


[22-Jun-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Oh I see


[22-Jun-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Do you produce MCG? I know it's easily the cheapest part of building the ADM but I can cover that at MOR lmao


[22-Jun-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Who am I kidding it's probably already covered... let me check


[22-Jun-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah - the MCG was contributed towards the ADM before I even started playing 😭


[22-Jun-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I only produce LST, 100%


[22-Jun-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	But yeah, MCG seems to be full no matter what the project or maintenance haha


[22-Jun-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	How many permits do you have on Montem and here?


[22-Jun-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I have 3 here and 1 on Montem. I abandoned Montem entirely, for now. It's just the base there


[22-Jun-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	No point deleting the base


[22-Jun-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Deleting a Montem base would make me cry.


[22-Jun-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	The base here is maxed, 30 extractors


[22-Jun-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	800 pioneers short though


[22-Jun-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... unless you could persuade 30 more people to do it too.


[22-Jun-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(hmm... ok, time to upgrade the HQ, sit on a permit and a base dropper in the warehouse again)


[22-Jun-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I see you're well establsihed in the system. What do you do with your Bastion colonies?


[22-Jun-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(a) -> (b) -> (c) <-> (d)


[22-Jun-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm setting up HYFs on C.  The HYFs produce agri to help produce at Sand and also stuff for INCs on d.


[22-Jun-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Do you produce your own NS?


[22-Jun-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm playing around with that.  Producing NS on b means I only need to import N into Bastion.


[22-Jun-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Nope, just LST. I want to be the #1 LST producer in the game


[22-Jun-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Oh sorry haha, you're asking him


[22-Jun-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Producing NS on Circe or YI-705 means shipping LST and water and N over there, and the NS back.


[22-Jun-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah, definitely have to fiddle with that a bit :o


[22-Jun-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	My NS production planet is like 2d away from where I end up using it


[22-Jun-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm half tempted to look all the way out at XG-326e for chem.


[22-Jun-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got an in system hauler dedicated to this system - and so damage to the FTL ships isn't a concern.


[22-Jun-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The only issue is that e is _way_ out there at about 6 AU.  Frost is at 2 AU.


[22-Jun-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	at one point should one repair the ships?


[22-Jun-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	146 SF for 6h Frost to bastion currently.


[22-Jun-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	General rule is 80%.  In system... I'm letting 'em go.


[22-Jun-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Do you think those armor and shielding upgrades are worth it?


[22-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	for FTL


[22-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It depends... currently, I'd generally say "no".


[22-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I guess it's a rich flex, if you can afford to be a bit lazy about it


[22-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The damage is stuff that is often racked up while you're flying in system.  The IS-XG has 69.899% condition on 21 days of flight time.


[22-Jun-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@shagie what hull plates do you use?


[22-Jun-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For in system... LHP.


[22-Jun-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For FTL ... I do RHP and HPR so that I can move that slider to the right.


[22-Jun-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	How much does your ship need to repair...if it's the one I'm thinking you're talking about (from that one screenshot) it's at like 50 something % right?


[22-Jun-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	funnily enough that it was mentioned, I almost named this planet today. still tossing around the idea of it but I don't want to do it willy nilly


[22-Jun-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'd also be interested in doing some chem - I don't have my in system ship built nor the HYF but I am producing NS on Circe to be used here


[22-Jun-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing is that in system ships rack up damage _so_ fast that it doesn't feel reasonable to try to repair them.


[22-Jun-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@shagie IF you're interested - I have enough repair parts right here on XG-326a if you want them :p


[22-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Even at 50%, the IS-XH is doing its job well enough.


[22-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I've kept LHP, SSC, MFK, and FLP here because of how much I was damaging my WCBs doing the circuit between MOR -> XG-326a -> QQ-001a


[22-Jun-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	100% condition, a->d is 67 SF 10h 55m.  At 60%, its 119 fuel to to do 5h.  19h with 64 fuel.


[22-Jun-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	at 40%, its 1d 5h for 68 fuel.


[22-Jun-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	adds up, doesn't it


[22-Jun-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hmmm - the offer for the parts is here if you want it. If not I'll just use em on the next WCBs that come in lmao


[22-Jun-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It does, but the flip side is at 10h 55m, I'm doing only one trip that day... so why is it an issue if its 10h 55m or 19h?


[22-Jun-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	2 WCBs


[22-Jun-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	WCB.


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	No, I have those already


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Don't upgrade engines.  Fuel tanks only if you need them.


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	More WCBs :]


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	haha


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm only slightly joking, I just bought four


[22-Jun-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I guess the FTL tank might use an upgrade, 300 seems annoyingly low


[22-Jun-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	You bought 4 WCBs, wow


[22-Jun-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah, a medium can hold 800 which is wayy better


[22-Jun-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 2x WCBs, 1x LCB, got a 250 speedy on order... still got a starter, that I think I'm going to upgrade the tank on it, but leave it otherwise untouched.


[22-Jun-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Bezborg that'll bring me up to...Eight? WCBs, I'm planning on upping my MCG production pretty soon so I have to be prepared.


[22-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and I've got 3x in system haulers that _really_ cut down my logistics need.


[22-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	STL ships are nice :}


[22-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Once the population is up on Bastion a, my LST production wil exceed my 2 WCBs' capacity to haul it, might need to start planning for more ships


[22-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	QQ-001 has 2 colonized planets.  XH-594 has 3.  XG-326 has 4 now.


[22-Jun-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Unless you guys want LST coming out of your ears


[22-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm already making too many rocks man :[


[22-Jun-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Paying crazy people to haul it away.


[22-Jun-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Well, that's why wee're on Bastion a :D


[22-Jun-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	To give the slaves smth to do


[22-Jun-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	How interesting that this planet has a shipyard


[22-Jun-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Need a shipyard somewhere if you've got multiple planets in system.


[22-Jun-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Hmm... I wonder if Titan could be pesuaded to flip to chem with GTU setting working more on TO-392d (Sabaton) which also runs Metallurgy.


[22-Jun-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	@Enemycube, what were your candidates for a name?


[22-Jun-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nýja Reykjavík


[22-Jun-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Lithoros or some variant is what I was leaning towards but ultimately I chose not to until I put more time into it


[22-Jun-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I am 95% not serious with that suggestion.


[22-Jun-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I think it'd definitely be nice to use my rename here given that I'll have a presence in most of this system. Otherwise I'll just sit on it and never use it


[22-Jun-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	How about LST-Al-Ghaib lol


[22-Jun-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Egyptian god Ptah was beleievd to create masonry.. I don't know why, but Limestone always associates me to ancient egypt


[22-Jun-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Calx is the latin word for chalk or limestone... perhaps an idea


[25-Jun-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I put in an LM ad for 1 LHP. I can't believe I was off by one for building my shuttle...


[25-Jun-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I gotcha brother.


[25-Jun-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you have my thanks. finally I'll be able to get my HYF going!


[25-Jun-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	<3


[26-Jun-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Should name the planet Excel so that $SAGA shows up with "Bastion - Excel" in the bases list.


[26-Jun-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Just FYI guys, my 2 WCB ships are moving goods between Bastion and Moria CX daily, and they are going back 99% empty from Moria.


[26-Jun-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	So if you need anything, just let me know, send me a message or draft a shipping contract and send to me directly, and I'll bring that stuff to you on Bastion


[26-Jun-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Bcs I'm doing the trip anyway, happy to help out the neighbors. You can tip me if you want, but I'll help regardless, it's a waste of cargo space on the way back


[27-Jun-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Frosty802** left.*


[29-Jun-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rakkzi**:	haha uh oh


[29-Jun-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rakkzi**:	latest popr is a lil rough


[29-Jun-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	is it? There's more open jobs yes, but we gained 1220 PIO so it doesn't seem unreasonable that we can close that gap


[29-Jun-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	POPI is stocked decently well too


[29-Jun-24 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Latest POPR looks positive actually :p


[29-Jun-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The last ten POPRs were stagnant, this is the only one that's had growth in a while - most likely thanks to $BEZ, $QUBE, and $TSB


[29-Jun-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I actually gained 400 workers yesterday, only 400 left to full workforce


[29-Jun-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That was a +1220 change.  There are still 1636 open jobs.


[29-Jun-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Still, a positive change in this case is way better than having a neutral number :p


[29-Jun-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rakkzi**:	I keep forgetting the open jobs doesn't take the increase into account


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'll be happy to dedicate time to manage the upkeep of whatever we need on the planet, or support anyone else who wants to do it. Agreed we should use the funds that are collected by default


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Man the LST market really sucks now, tough times for a 100% LST producer lol


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	LST -> NS.NC1 (look at the order book)


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	yeah, the real money will be in derivative products


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	LST was amazing until recently, made most of my money selling LST at 300


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Also it's cheap to make, simple, straightforward


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	But I think i can finally branch out because with my Bastion base, I will be the #1 LST producer in the game, which was my goal


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I keep eyeing Bastion e for some larger scale chem for FLX and NS to ship back down to b and c.


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Currently #3 I think


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Any chem planet in bastion at the moment?


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm in a strong need for another chem world. I would totally pitch in on infrastructure costs for that


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I don't mind dedicating an entire base to FLX, also quite simple and straightforward which I need in life


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	NS isn't too bad either. you can get H2O on Frost and import N


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Actually maybe I should just use my Montem base tbh... but happy to ship it back to Bastion a and pass it to any neighbor that needs it for cheap


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Montem is FLX... and my 2 WCB ships go back from Moria every day empty


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Sorry Montem is chem


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The main awkwardness with XG-326e is needing AEF.NC1


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	a montem base 😍 I thought I'd have one, it was down to +19 but then an influx of new players filled it up again


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	It's just the starter base haha


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Hmm... I've got a PP2 that's mostly unused (not much AL - its doing BDE mostly) ... I should see about producing some small sake AEF there.


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	If you all need suppost with cheap chem products like FLX, I don't mind helpong out with that at all


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got PLI OT-580b on my start screen with a spare permit and a base in a box in a warehouse.


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Or are you all into self-sufficiency :D


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	my biggest issue right now is h2o. I have too many HYFs set up so I have to import it from Etherwind and still can't keep it up


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	more Chem would be nice, but primarily for profit given the NS situation


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	and if it was in system, nice logistics


[30-Jun-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	but, since you have montem and the empty ship situation it wouldn't be bad to then do smelting on titan


[30-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm going to do some GL smelting there I think, but not sure that buying FLX is worth it


[30-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I've also got a base in a box @shagie, I guess we'll see who gets it first if not both of us >:)


[30-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I saw it at +30 the other day... when I looked 10 minutes ago, it was +37.  Now its +38.


[30-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	yeah so it may be neither of us

**EnemyCube**:	unless we can convince enough new people to COLIQ and go somewhere else


[30-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I don't regret leaving my original base there and starting on Verdant. but sometimes I think of how it'd have been nice to snag a Montem or Promitor base


[30-Jun-24 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I think I'll do it, set up a 1-permit CHEM base on Montem tomorrow morning and produce NS. Thank you for the tip shagie


[30-Jun-24 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Will prbably have to rely on shipping contracts to get it to Moria station, I can barely keep up with the LST hauling from Bastion lol


[01-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	that should be incredibly easy since it's right next to the CX. easily worth the cost


[01-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Alas... +41 today.

**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Shagie, I have a question


[05-Jul-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	if I build a PAC here to run pioneer immigration, are you able to run the program immediately, or do you need to wait for elections


[05-Jul-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It would need to wait for a government to be installed.  Elections start immediately (IIRC).

**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	ty


[06-Jul-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	And with that POPR, we have heaps of excess PIO, about 2.5k. Next week will see even more so now we just have to wait and see what it'll settle to once the upkeeps run out.


[08-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  By _far_.  I'm occasionally casting glances over at PP p-XG-326a pp-ADM for things to haul into the planet.


[08-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	We want a governor?


[08-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It would allow running of programs to get PIO faster and have someone who is collecting the production fees to use them to fill COGC.


[08-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I agree with the COGC. since there's fees going to the treasury they may as well be used


[08-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	getting PIO faster isn't bad, but it may only be marginally useful unless more people show up. it's a good benefit nonetheless

[14-Jul-24 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	guys, I'm seriously considering leaving the LST industry and just going into something more basic, like fuel refining or smth... it might be I'll leave Bastion at some point


[14-Jul-24 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	So heads up, if you want to scoop up the 1800 pioneers before they leave


[14-Jul-24 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@Bezborg Check out Gasworld and Cortez for fuel refining.  If you make NAB on Montem you can ship that to Gasworld, use the AMM there, and make SF.  Just one of the options to consider.


[14-Jul-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's WB-675i - though also look at something like YI-705c where you can ship HAL back to Montem and process that to CL (and EPO).


[14-Jul-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Thank you my good man, I was indeed looking at Gasworld


[14-Jul-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Most likely will stay with NS on Montem while it's profitable and just buy NAB, but yes, eventually I'd like to produce all ingredients myself


[14-Jul-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'll likely leave a base on Bastion though, as I prefer the no-faction bonuses


[14-Jul-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	an inert base with no production buildings


[14-Jul-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I am _completely_ in favor of you buying NAB.NC1.


[14-Jul-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Though you can knock about 30 NCC of that price off if you buy NA.NC1 at 25.10 and some BOR and spin it yourself.


[14-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	thank you my good man :)


[14-Jul-24 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I keep playing with PrunPlanner to try and figure out the perfect fuel refining base with 3 permits, but the pioneer/settler ratio is wonky


[14-Jul-24 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	trying to figure out how to effectively use the barracks building


[14-Jul-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're better off setting up two fuel refining bases at 500 each than one with 3 permits.


[14-Jul-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	there doesn't seem to be a way to fully staf 30 refineries


[14-Jul-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Seriously, you can make a LOT of fuel even with one partial permit.


[14-Jul-24 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	The way I play is mostly "finishing" a planet and plan the next one haha


[14-Jul-24 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Gasworld I definitely want to max, as it;s just next door to the CX and has the COCG...


[14-Jul-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Cortez does EXT for TS and then I spin some of that into HE3 because I'm lazy with logistics there... and even with EXT, and making FF, SF, and HE3 in the REFs there Cortez is producing 3k SF and 2k FF per day.


[14-Jul-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	hmmm


[14-Jul-24 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you put down a permit on Gasworld, put down one and get that spun up before planning out two more permits there... and consider that you could put another permit on Cortez and get the same area.


[14-Jul-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While permits are cheap now, you'll be _much_ better off long term with 2x 1 permit bases than 1x 3 permit base for fuel on your roadmap.


[14-Jul-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	thank you mate


[14-Jul-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	The biggest waste of this whole plan of mine is the 2 WCB ships that are now all wrong for this new direction


[14-Jul-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Man i wish one could sell or swap ships


[14-Jul-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	NAB is WCB friendly.  SF is balanced (WCB is no worse than a MCB or VCB).


[14-Jul-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	True I guess, I could just upgrade the fuel tanks and use that to supplement the shipping


[14-Jul-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Thank you my good man


[14-Jul-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Unload all but 100 or so SF on the MOR - Gasworld leg.  Its another 90t of SF.  FF is also very WCB friendly.  Though making it is shipping HE and H - which are much more VCB prefered.


[14-Jul-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That said, upgrading a starter ship to a WCB is never the wrong thing to do.


[14-Jul-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	i guess that would be a reasonable next goal, to get a gas transporter as a 3rd ship, why not


[14-Jul-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gas transports are _very_ specialized.  For a third ship, a LCB has a lot more utility and with 2000 m3 of space rather than 3000 m3 of space (for a VCB) is almost as good... but you'll use 2k/2k much more than 1k t / 3k m3.


[14-Jul-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A VCB ship is also a LOT slower than a WCB or LCB.


[14-Jul-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	oh actually yeah that's what I meant with gas transport, a VCB, as most gasses in the game are volume


[14-Jul-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	is there an actual gas transport that's not VCB?


[14-Jul-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	wait


[14-Jul-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Sorry I'm home sick and brain is not working


[14-Jul-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I see, lcb, I get it, sorry


[14-Jul-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	you're probably right, a lcb would make SF shipping easier as well


[14-Jul-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	LCB is good for SF, yes.


[14-Jul-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	could open up my WCB ships for other projects tbh


[14-Jul-24 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I got my LCBs focusing on my ag and fuel while my WCBs are shipping rocks everywhere.


[14-Jul-24 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Them Gasworld enviromentals though... yikes


[14-Jul-24 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Meh, typical gas giant


[14-Jul-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	prun planner says over 4mil to build up a 3-permit base haha... well, i guess deconstruction Bastion will provide most of the materials


[14-Jul-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You planning on a full three permit for Gasworld..?


[14-Jul-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	yes I believe so


[14-Jul-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	What're you using the AMM for other than that fuel plan?


[14-Jul-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	It's just how I play, i like to go all in on a product


[14-Jul-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Well I'm not going to dissuade you from what you want to do, but you could probably supply that base with a *partial* permit on Gasworld


[14-Jul-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	It's gonna be all fuel refineries, not interested in the AMM. I'm there for the COGC and the proximity to the CX


[14-Jul-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Ooh gasworld is fuel refining


[14-Jul-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Alright I feel dumb now, yeahhh


[14-Jul-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	:D


[14-Jul-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Haven't looked at it since I started, assumed it was Resource Extraction


[14-Jul-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm not sure how convenient it would be for you, but check out... XH-594c?


[14-Jul-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Not a gas giant but low pressure instead, so exchanging AEF for SEA, arguably cheaper?


[14-Jul-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Yep, shagie recommended COrtez already, as well as going for muptiple 1-permit bases instead of a 3-permit base


[14-Jul-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I think eventually I'll have a 3-permit base on both


[14-Jul-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Oooh boy


[14-Jul-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	It's just my obsession to go all in on something and be the #1 prooducer in the game :D


[14-Jul-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I wish you luck! I just have a one permit on VH-778b but I'm running the normal SF & FF recipes so I only have 12 REFs


[14-Jul-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I started with LST because I liked the simplicity of it and it was really profitable... bit clearly I started playing in the middle of the LST bull market... now it;s crap


[14-Jul-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'm currently #1 LST producer but I don't rly like it anymore


[14-Jul-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I'll be the #1 NS producer too, once the weekly production numbers update, it's all set up, now it's just ticking


[14-Jul-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	#1 NS producer by double the current #1


[14-Jul-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	There's only one thing I want to be #1 of...


[14-Jul-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll let it be a secret :]


[14-Jul-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	oh come on :D


[14-Jul-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It's not really a secret, just messin around. I've probably mentioned it here or elsewhere, but I like producing MCG.


[14-Jul-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Yeah, I get it :D there;s some satisfaction in producing a super basic ubiquitous good that everyone needs in vast quantities, and the production chain is simple


[14-Jul-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I live for it haha


[14-Jul-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Fuel is not as simple as I like, but it can't get more basic than that


[14-Jul-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Maybe RAT and DW are as basic


[14-Jul-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	I looked into going all in on DW haha, but the ingredient quantities are vast


[14-Jul-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	like 10k H2O per day... doable but micro-intensive


[14-Jul-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	at least with WCB ships


[14-Jul-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	However one could set up a big food processing operation on Pallada


[14-Jul-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'd suggest the set of: Montem (Chem stuffs).  YI-705c (EXT (HAL), CHP (CL + NA), + POL?).  Gasworld (NAB based SF). Everything in that is balanced or dense (WCB prefered).


[14-Jul-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Why there rather than Sand?


[14-Jul-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	sounds like a plan shagie, thank you, writing this down


[14-Jul-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Sand is better for food processing?


[14-Jul-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I keep telling people that YI-705c (EXTs and CHPs and POLs) is my best preforming base on just one permit.


[14-Jul-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	SEA vs whatever OT-580d takes (INS and HSE if I recall) ... and has more traffic to / from it.  And is at the midway (thus the name) MOR - Verdant.  If you expand out to YI-705c then YI-715b makes sense.


[14-Jul-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Look at the population and plot counts from OT-580d and WB-675b ... and if you set up on gas world... well, don't ever fly WB-675b to WB-675i but its similar routes.


[14-Jul-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Sand looks good, but if one were to buy h2o from the CX and just turn it into DW, surely the proximity of Pallada is better?


[14-Jul-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Frost and Verdant.


[14-Jul-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For that matter, XG-452b is the secret water world of the sector.


[14-Jul-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and if you're after a DW setup, then XG-430c is one jump from XG-452b and XG-430c is a triple green world.


[14-Jul-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	The thing with Frost is, even with a 3-permit base, running 30 EXT, with all luxuries, 5 res extractor experts and a corp HQ for that 10%, it's still just 3.5k h20 per day...


[14-Jul-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	But if one was insane and go for a 3-permit food proc base for DW wxclusively, it' slike 10k h20 per day :D


[14-Jul-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XG-452b is the secret water world.


[14-Jul-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pull up the PLI for that planet and click on the blue spots and consider if they know what they're doing.


[14-Jul-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example PPI fa995d51


[14-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	yep, RIG is the answer


[14-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	Got 6.6k h20 per day, maxed out


[14-Jul-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	still far from a mega DW operation's needs, but mitigates a lot, providing one has the fleet for it


[14-Jul-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I can vouch for YI-705c, my other bases look like fun side projects compared to the profit that one pulls in from very simple C production

**EnemyCube**:	@Bezborg I can respect your strong desire to fight uphill on how you want to build. but be weary that fighting the current may not make you feel any better than LST did


[15-Jul-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	True enough, thank you. But without purpose, the game has no point at all, even if the purpose is finite


[15-Jul-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's challenge and there's saying "that's a steel slope to climb" when looking at rock climbing El Capitan.


[15-Jul-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I want to (will) build out on Bastion e as a chem base ... its going to be a challenge to fund it enough to get it up and running and returning a profit.  However, doing that is drawing upon my experience at doing easier things and the income from doing those easier things so that I don't have to take out a lowstrife loan to do what I want ... even if it takes several months.


[15-Jul-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	A fuel refining base on Gasworld, according to prunplanner, wil have about 90k daily profit without any experts, and up to 130-140k with 5 experts, at current prices. It’s not the best, but far from a disaster either


[15-Jul-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bezborg**:	it’s fine :D

**AirbusFloA320**:	Hello, everyone! Our planet can finally form a government. Yesterday, I was able to contribute the last resources and initiate the construction. I would be very grateful if you would place your trust in me and give me your vote at the start, so I can represent you as governor.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Funny, you announcing that after the last mesage in the chat! Look forward to your governance :]

**AirbusFloA320**:	True, that’s what I thought at first as well. However, the message from fishmodem is already quite old :-)


[27-Nov-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	putting in the effort to set up an admin center is more than enough proof to me that you've got what it takes


[27-Nov-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**fishmodem**:	fun fact, this planet has the highest titanium concentration in the whole galaxy

**AirbusFloA320**:	The last few weeks went well, and I thought it might be a good idea to invest in something. :-)
