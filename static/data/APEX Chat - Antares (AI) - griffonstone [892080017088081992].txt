**Dover**:	Hey folks. Just stopped by. Got a mostly empty ship flying to Deimos now if anyone has any packages?


[03-Oct-21 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Need any NA?


[04-Oct-21 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Hey, a bit of an emergency, I don't have enough space to load and offload everything onto my ship. Could someone buy 170 HAL for me and then sell it back in a few seconds please?

[04-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Visinvictus**:	I have come to steal your salt


[04-Oct-21 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Rain has plenty to go around


[04-Oct-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	So many salty tears


[04-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We've got 8 people here now, get your bases down quick before the planet's full!


[04-Oct-21 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	healthy and safety are going to drop like a rock


[04-Oct-21 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We're still set to be at 130% safety and 200% health next report. With lots of room for growth if we supply the safety station


[05-Oct-21 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Well, just remember that everyone who settles here is probably going to have a full base in 2 weeks


[05-Oct-21 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	and i wouldn't be surprisd if some had a 750/750


[05-Oct-21 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	I am 750/750 (near enough(


[05-Oct-21 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	/me looks at my 100 pioneers...


[05-Oct-21 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Thanks for the extra health and safety


[05-Oct-21 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Built as many HBXs as I could before the POPR.


[05-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Visinvictus**:	good luck on the population lottery everyone


[05-Oct-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	So I ended up with 151/150 pio, 85/85 set, and 1/0 tec


[05-Oct-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Visinvictus**:	I got 300 pio, 143 settlers


[05-Oct-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Visinvictus**:	fortunately settlers are growing rapidly so we should have many in a few weeks


[05-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	lol I am 33/160 techs


[05-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	and you got 1/0


[05-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lockreed**:	POPI, in a nutshell


[05-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	300 pio, 143 set


[05-Oct-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	460 pio, 270 set, seems broken


[05-Oct-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	not bad tho, 56% settler efficiency and POL-EPO still running at 91% efficiency


[05-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	260 PIO, 390 SET. Soon 0/non-zero ENG


[06-Oct-21 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Anyone sitting on some PT?


[06-Oct-21 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I can spare 1.


[06-Oct-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	Up to 10 players now...


[17-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	This place is going to have so many techs


[17-Oct-21 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We're almost 1:1 PIO:SET, which is pretty good.


[18-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Latro**:	get off my lawn, I started all this tech growth way back in may and now only have 59/70! /s


[18-Oct-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Latro**:	(in all seriousness I suspect in net I have probably gained techs as a result of having neighbors with sets)


[18-Oct-21 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If we can get those HAB in we can have even more TEC


[18-Oct-21 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Which should be here in <1 week


[18-Oct-21 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Anyone got some C to spare?


[18-Oct-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I remember back when the neighborhood was a nice place.


[18-Oct-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	When I was the... third colonizer?


[19-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	"soon there will be a dozen of us!" Latro was right!


[24-Oct-21 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If someone could haul in a bunch of DW for the PAR, that would be awesome. I have enough PFE to last 6/7 days, so we should be fine next week. We only need 1 input


[24-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PeregrineAnatum**:	I'll see about getting some PFE made, and cart down some DW as soon as I can.


[24-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Uh, Desan is bringing 5k DW...


[24-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	well, at 35, i guess it's not the cheapest.


[24-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	So, I'll have a boatload of DW.


[24-Oct-21 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We only need 50 a week, not too bad.


[24-Oct-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Or ~25 PFE


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PeregrineAnatum**:	80 PFE on the way


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PeregrineAnatum**:	Err, sorry, 120.


[27-Oct-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Please stop feeding the PAR, we're already way over 100% already. In 10 or so days we'll need more


[29-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Looking to buy some O if anyone can spare some.

[29-Oct-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PeregrineAnatum**:	Tossed in PFE


[30-Oct-21 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I'm making 5 DEC


[30-Oct-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Those are expensive. I'd recommend trying to sell those instead of contributing them to the PAR

**Earthling**:	the OOG corp is on a small discord chat.


[01-Nov-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Earthling**:	glad to be on giffonstone. looks like this is where all the cool kids are. Any local rules i should know about?


[01-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Not really. The more jobs you can bring the better.


[01-Nov-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Now there are actually a dozen of us @Latro


[01-Nov-21 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Don't lick the yellow salt


[01-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	There's a ship sitting here from user VEB152 he's looking for any shipments available to move on.


[01-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	To where?


[01-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	"not sure yet; was planning to check for a decent route tomorrow to swing by another exchange before heading back to Benten"


[01-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Fairly new player, but just brought me a shipload from BEN


[01-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Don't think I have anything quite yet for that


[01-Nov-21 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Earthling**:	yellow salt, lol


[03-Nov-21 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'm bringing in some TUB and OFF for the INF and SST soon to boost our health and safety back above 100%


[11-Nov-21 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Does anyone have some GAL here?


[11-Nov-21 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	I have 64 on ANT


[11-Nov-21 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but none here

**Latro**:	fio is bringing some, but that's gonna be a bit


[11-Nov-21 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Latro**:	(and we won't be bringing it at steady state, it's just to use up the leftovers from our previous SF op)


[13-Nov-21 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Yeah, bot looking for a regular supply, Was just going to make a few LDI

**rain9441**:	3x25 CL sell ads up on LM for anyone who is looking to bootstrap their POL with a buffer.  For some reason I make excess CL and HAL


[18-Nov-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I'm surprised by how low you're selling HAL.


[18-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It's not a supply, it's excess due to uneven ratios.  You can't rely on it, but it can be a good way to bootstrap production


[18-Nov-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'm not here for HAL or money, i'm here for EPO, and I consider the excess HAL as waste, not unlike NA


[18-Nov-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Speaking of NA, I’ll buy it for 20/u in AIC. Get it out of your hair


[19-Nov-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	You can have some of mine PiBoy. Ad up


[19-Nov-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Gravy**:	Hi party people!  Weird actually seeing a few different people on this planet


[29-Nov-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Well, you're right that we're few.  And also different.


[29-Nov-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	Is anyone interested in contributing towards a corp HQ on Griffonstone to boost the efficiency of everyone on the planet by 10%?


[01-Feb-22 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	(everyone able to join that corp to be clear)


[01-Feb-22 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	True. So governors of other planets are out, as are those who want to stay in their current ingame corp (although it wouldn't replace your out-of-game corp)


[02-Feb-22 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I haven't heard anything from Bob. Maybe he went to you PM? If not, let me know. I can throw down some CIS


[02-Feb-22 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I haven’t heard from Bob either. I don’t have someone who can supply that many R-fabs at this point, so that’s the main concern.

[22-Mar-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Didn't they?  I thought open jobs was pre-change, and we could have been fine with... well, education 2, anyway.


[22-Mar-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I hope the governor considers festivities for next week, to try to drive up those PIO numbers.


[22-Mar-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's wild we have 12 SCI now and 407 ENG... Open jobs are way over filled. Festivities 3 or even just festivities 1 or 2 should do it


[22-Mar-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	wait what? am i not reading the chart right? pios and sets still have unemployment (too much pio and set) and there still a huge demend for tecs and eng. so.. education 3 is fine, isnt it?


[22-Mar-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The unemployment and open jobs numbers are calculated before migration and education, the real pioneer unemployment is negative - open jobs. I'm down to 386 PIO / 435 right now.


[22-Mar-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Settlers I think are still fine


[22-Mar-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And technicians and engineers are way overfilled, as you'll see next week


[22-Mar-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Mar-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	we had 2468/2915 techs and 168/280 engineers prior to the report.  We now have 1976 unemployed techs and 127 unemployed engineers.


[22-Mar-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I wonder if Festivites 2/3 would be better? The huge uptick in Happy so close to 100% should drive a massive PIO wave incoming?


[22-Mar-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I also am down 100 Pios


[22-Mar-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I just paid to fund festivities 2. Since by a rough estimate, PIO happiness should naturally be >80% at that time


[22-Mar-22 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Also @Frostwood you can't be a governor on two planets at once. I don't even know how you've managed to run on Griffonstone

[31-Mar-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Settlers grow plenty fine. Technicians grow from education as well. And if you want more ENG at any point, you can pay out the money to grow them. We've got more than enough already.

**Namthorn**:	popr was yesterday sadly so you'll be waiting a little while


[06-Apr-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes I know. unfortunately an ealier build wasn't possible due to logistic problems. But this base will only support others, not a big problem if it starts full production next 2 weeks because next bases are not ready at the moment


[06-Apr-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	all good then


[06-Apr-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	in the meantime there's an open corp hq here if you dont have a hq bonus elsewhere


[06-Apr-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Ok thanks, but I am already taken care of regarding corp.


[06-Apr-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@xensored it doesn’t look like your part of a corp in game. This is a no-strings attached 10% bonus to productivity, not an actual corp


[06-Apr-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	thx again for the invite and explanation @PiBoy


[09-Apr-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	what to we need, more lower tier or engineers?


[09-Apr-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	Hey all, thanks for the vote of confidence in me as a governor. i hope that we can work together to make this planet attractive to all - lower and higher tier alike. as we all know, the location is very strategic and uniqu in the universe, and there' no reason wwhy we cant be te envy of all. we'll make this place GREAT (not again, more then ever before).


[09-Apr-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	for the next planetary program, i'm inclined to choose Family Support. all those who need engineers (me included) can contact me and talk weth me directly, we would need to invest in culture and comfort if we want it to be sustainable for long term with festivals, else we'll just put out fires week by week and it'll come at the expense of lower tiers.


[09-Apr-22 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	I will build an other AML and a EEP soon. I dont plane to run the EEP with scis directly (dont have the housing yet)


[09-Apr-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I also plan an EEP with ENG only soon


[09-Apr-22 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Also, I would highly recommend against family support. I believe that only affects PIO->TEC. Festivities would mean that we don’t lose engineers next report, which will be very important


[09-Apr-22 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And in the future, I’d be willing to pay for engineer migration, should it become necessaru


[09-Apr-22 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	*necessary


[09-Apr-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’ve queued up inputs for the 10 DEC for an ART. I can also provide funding for that if it’s needed, although I encourage others using ENG to pitch in


[09-Apr-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I'll build 3 CHP and 3 LAB next week but SET and TEC shouldn't be a problem


[09-Apr-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	@Blider you keep in minde to change the tax collection to your corp so the money dont go into the void hole?


[09-Apr-22 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	@harmony we're in the same Corp.


[09-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	need to change the governing entity, it's set to Antares initiative


[09-Apr-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	can see under LR that taxes will be going into the void atm rather than GSO


[09-Apr-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	festivals (2) increase happynes by 10% across all the board, but if engineers are at 35 and with festivals it'll be 45, then its still under 50 and there population will decrease right?


[09-Apr-22 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	@Namthorn got it. fixed


[09-Apr-22 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	"An unhappy workforce tier (happiness < 50%) will decline."


[09-Apr-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	so festivals (2) wont stop it.


[09-Apr-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	i guess it'll be a week of Family Support and after that a week of immigration. rinse and repeat. any objections?


[09-Apr-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yeah, you'd have to do Fest 3


[09-Apr-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But, POPI buildings are still useful if programs are insufficient. It raises your minimum baseline making all those more effective


[10-Apr-22 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	hey @all, so i've done some research and calcs, and formulated a game plan. we have a bottleneck of safety and health that puts a cap oh the happiness of settlers and techs which inturn inhibits their natural growth. i would like to address that first so that it'll rais the ceiling for all the workforce and we wouldn worry about it anymore, ever. after dealing with that in a permanent meter, i'll address to engineers (just so you'd know, my whole opperation on griff relies on engineers).


[10-Apr-22 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	for that to work, it would take capital, i wold ask for a few welthy volunteers to help me in the endeavor. i'm personaly gonna allocate 50K a week to that couse and as i'll ramp up my opperations that figure will rise. @those-who-choose-to-help, i'm NOT asking you to match that, and not expecting it, what ever you can spair would be fine. my fellas @GSO coprmates, we are getting weekly dividends from taxes, if you don't REALLY need that income to survive, i humbly request that those funds will go to their intended purpose as taxes to improve the conditions on that planet.


[10-Apr-22 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	thank you @ALL for your attention.


[10-Apr-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Blinder Family support doesn't affect engineers


[10-Apr-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Festivities 3 would increase ENG happiness up near 50%. Even if it's at 45%, we would net positive engineers with the effect of education from technicians


[10-Apr-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	In fact, since settler and technician happiness are less than 70%, Family support will have zero effect on either of them


[10-Apr-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	With unemployment in pioneers resolved, they may drop below 70 as well, or near to it. Which would mean zero or no effect

[11-Apr-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	thanks for your input PiBoy, unfortunatly Family support has already been set and canot be changed fot the comming week.. that been said, a lot has changed since yesterday. as we've spoken in privet, i want to share with everyone all that's happening to improve the population and happiness status for all.


[11-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	currently we have Safety Station Lv2, Infirmary Lv1 (getting an upgreade in the next few days), Wildlife Park Lv1. i've bought all the upkeep for all of them for the next 3-4 weeks.


[11-Apr-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	shoutout to @Gravy, @PiBoy, and @Pokter for their generous contributions. without them it wouldnt be possible.


[11-Apr-22 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	if there are others who can contribut it would be very appreciated and would help a lot towards future plans. also, @GSO members who didnt contributed yet, please let me know your position, otherwise, there wouldnt be any reason for any taxes on that planet,


[11-Apr-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Citronnade**:	@Blinder I can contribute but I don't have the time to bring materials; if you put up some DW sell ads I can pick them up when I see them


[11-Apr-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-22 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	none missing here, though it's possible we'll have a settler issue next popr as there's only a handful in the reserve pool it looks like


[14-Apr-22 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	39 Settlers and 71 techs missing right now


[14-Apr-22 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	you got missing techs? thats interesting.. the repors says that there's unemployment (which reduces the happiness dramaticaly) and no open jobs...


[14-Apr-22 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	open jobs is from before the new pop total count iirc


[14-Apr-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That’s strange… jobs should be filled with the exception of engineers and new buildings built


[14-Apr-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Namthorn there’s still lots to unemployment after losing those TEC


[14-Apr-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We don’t have much of a buffer on the settlers or pioneers though


[14-Apr-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	silly retired gov questions, is it enough if we keep running festivity and maybe a education after next popr to help pop grow or should we go for building this ART to help Engi grow?


[03-May-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	no need for art. eng' happiness is above 70 (85) the population will grow to the max


[03-May-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	i thought higher culture also increase grow and keeps Engis on the planet


[03-May-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	next thing, i also thought 70% happiness is also just the cap of keeps Engis from leaving, everything above 70 increases grow


[03-May-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	you are right. every word. as long as the happiness is above 50 and no demand from sci', they wont leave. - above 70 they'll increas.. i thought of emigration (to not disturb lowet tiers) if the growth will be to slow


[03-May-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	im right? wow i have to mark my calendar :D


[03-May-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	soo should we aim for a ART?


[03-May-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think it's fine now. As long as the PAR is filled, should be fine.


[03-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	as soon as i build up my production on Deimos again i can try to make some STR or OFF. is easier to produce for me as to buy. still kinder broke with my 30k AIC :D


[04-May-22 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	i get you. every contribution will be appriciated. just let me know what and when you can help with so i'd know what to buy and what not to buy.


[04-May-22 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	any one alse?


[04-May-22 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	You should probably alwo make a call on the discord. Not everyone looks into the ingame chat


[04-May-22 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	good idea, will do.


[04-May-22 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Morning. Just FYI - i'm working within FIO to help get the level 3 WAR completed so we can have a 2nd rental. Are you getting caught up on acquiring the CoGC and POPI inputs? I don't have anymore on planet to help out, but can try to import if you're still short (it's not you, just overall game shortages of supplies ATM)


[04-May-22 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	is there a use for 2nd rental on this planet? i wasnt aware.


[04-May-22 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	about the POPI inputs, yeah the market is in chaos, but we do have a handle on it, it just cost more then usual. therefore the request for contribution is much more important.


[04-May-22 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ad up for emergency O if anyone has extra. Thanks


[04-May-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	got boatloads of the stuff, literally drowning in O from se-648c xD


[04-May-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Do you have boatloads on Griffonstone? How much can I buy for what price?


[04-May-22 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	ive got 150 here extra i can sell @80, can bring a full shipload to sell early next week.


[04-May-22 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	can sell direct on se-648c for cheaper if you're willing to pick it up


[04-May-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	Little popi question, if i buy scis on grif now, without any sci popi and enploy them all, would they still stay if we keep the happiness high enough with festivitys?


[04-May-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	as it stands now, sci dont have any happiness at all (only the 20% of the fest)


[04-May-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	thats probably the 100% unemployment malus


[04-May-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	as there are 2 sci here, so that gets taken into account


[04-May-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	i think if you 100% filled their needs and activated festivities III you would be at 65% happiness for sci


[04-May-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	(their needs minus culture and education)


[04-May-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	with the last popr % needs though. you probably wouldnt make it over 60%


[04-May-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	50%*


[04-May-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	if safety was boosted up a bit, raising the comfort cap i think it'd work though


[04-May-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	safety is the next thing that i'm gonna tackle, dont know what it'll do to the sci happiness though. we have more people on the planet then we use to so the 2 SST are not enough.


[04-May-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it really is the -100% from unemployment that is hiding sci happiness checked a world out in the middle of nowhere iwth no comfort,culture or education and it's at ~22%


[04-May-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	once jobs are open for them it'll show a more accurate figure here


[04-May-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	id estimate with jobs open we're currently around 45-50%


[04-May-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	includoing the 20% from festivities


[04-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	you are welcome to try it, but at your own risk. atm we cant divert resources for dedicated infrastructure


[04-May-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Just come mimick EW POPI levels :)


[04-May-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	the safety will be increaced in the comming week or two


[04-May-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HarmonyStrips**:	i will drop a HB5 in the next couple of days


[04-May-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	let us know how your numbers are


[04-May-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it'll also take a few weeks to sort out average happiness i think, so some sci would depart even if the true happiness goes over the mark


[04-May-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you bought SCI now, and didn't have an HB5 by next report, most of them would leave. A lot of them will still leave when you put down your HB5, but not all of them.


[04-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	there are only 2 on the planet :D


[04-May-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you added 25 more, quite a few would leave because they could be, at most, 40% happy that first week. You'd probably have to buy them twice to get 20. But that's just back of the hand math.


[04-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	are you talking about imigration? thats not happening


[04-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	No, he talkijg about happiness current and the last 4 being averaged into it as well


[04-May-22 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Takes 2-3 in a row to undo bad trends


[04-May-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yes, pretty much. And since the averaged happiness is unlikely to be above 50%, it will take upwards of 5 weeks to stop the loss


[04-May-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Even more for the system to readjust if you overshoot and make unemployment

**Blinder**:	hey @all, so the planet is in a great shape. we got a second INF and a third SST, all with upkeep. no shortage of workers and all the population is happy. the two next planetary programs are set and payed for. and so i guess that there is no better time to let you know that when this term will over, i'll be stepping down from office. please, consider running for governorship, this is a great planet with a great populous and you all deserve being taking care of. i would hate to see this great shape that the planet is at, being wasted. i would have continued as a gov, but unfortunatly the game is not allowing to a non-resident to be in office and i do need to decommission my base here. for any ad all questions, dont hesitate to contact me. best regards to you all.

[27-May-22 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	But on an egoistic topic, is anyone her making (and more importantly also selling) PG ? :)


[27-May-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	Will do! I like to keep a stockpile on NA.CI1


[04-Jun-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	Here we are :) In the last days I've started to find sources for all the different POPI resources and I have most already under control. I'm right now building up a stock in order to fill the needs continuously and have extended the POPI program (I've just continued the last one as I need to learn a bit more to understand the complete POP topic). In order to pay the bill I would like to ask some contributions (the complete cost per month are ~650k AIC).


[04-Jun-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	650k a month?


[04-Jun-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	90k for continous Festivity II, and 550k for the POPI buildings (assuming better than CX rates) with the current support on the buildings


[04-Jun-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	ok, well not exactly, because I'll stop with DEC as that's rather expensive and it will be substituted by PFE


[06-Jun-22 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It was more of a "OMG" question. I've never paid attention to the costs of buying all the Etherwind POPI stuff, but the monthly needs vastly exceed Griff, so I wonder if I should start lol.


[06-Jun-22 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The costs of running tax free are high it appears


[06-Jun-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you want to finance it in intervals of 100k, you can put up ads on the LM selling expensive DW or whatever, and I’ll take a couple. Others may as well.


[06-Jun-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	I'll set up 2*DW, so whoever wants can contribute :), I've already received a nice contribution from @Gravy and we get discounted DW from @Xensored (plus he will contribute a load of PFE when necessary, but that was already agreed with Blinder).


[06-Jun-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	I myself will provide OFF/SUN/STR/TUB as I can very easily make that


[07-Jun-22 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jun-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	Hey folks, after the last POPR I've played around with the POPI numbers and in order to keep our ENG happy we have to add some culture (and later on also a bit more comfort, I've also done a bit of spying on other planets, the alternative would be all the time FESTIVITY III). Money is not really an issue I already started buying the lfabs for an ART and I've got at least one source for consumables (if someone has a cheaper one I'm always open 🙂 ).


[15-Jun-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	The only thing that is more complicated is the WOR and there I was wondering if someone could provide them (or has a provider where I could get them from)


[15-Jun-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Do your #'s on the ENGs, and your overall fulfillment %'s. IIRC the higher tier %'s are capped to match the lowest of the 2 bases (Safety/Health). It may be easier to focus on getting the SST and INF up vs the comf/culture


[15-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But honestly, I quit pulling up that POPI calculator once I got EW to stability. I way overdid it on the SST, but it's allowed me to go to easy street


[15-Jun-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	I've tried to play around with them as well but the impact was limited (right now I was looking at deimos and things are looking pretty good there)


[17-Jun-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	What are ya'll doing to the HAL market?


[17-Jun-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-22 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	@GSO, as you can see I've switched corp and with this also the collector. As Griff is running on min taxes this should not make a big difference for all of you and the POPI resources I'm paying on my own should offset this. There are right now no plans on changing anything on the tax schema.

[22-Jul-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	ah


[22-Jul-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	Well from the trust point of view I think I've done a quite good job in keeping the POP happy and I have some plans in terms of expanding them (PAR for example to reduce the effective cost for the POPI supply) in order to always keep a backup so people can expand when they want.


[22-Jul-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	And as Griff is providing me a baseline for my production chain, I'm very interested in keeping it in good shape and I've also the economy to keep the current support


[22-Jul-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	i did not notice that


[22-Jul-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	This might be more complicated for an account with only 2 bases, as feeding all the POPI is quite expensive (I've only collected some money during my first term)


[22-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	I definitely appreciate the work you've put in Pokter, and look forward to your continued governance


[22-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	this planet is a pretty important part of my operation, so looking to keep it running smoothly


[22-Jul-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	ah fair @Magesty973 , idk if the system will actually let you win though even if you get the most votes. The last thing we want is no governor for a term if it says no to you.


[22-Jul-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	I'm all for a competition though. What can you pledge above what the incumbent has done?


[22-Jul-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I can confirm that you can win and function as governor if you run and your pro license ends before the election is over.


[22-Jul-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Then we should put taxes at a better rate then.


[23-Jul-22 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	I agree


[23-Jul-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	This planet is not the best it could be , when it comes to inviting new players to settle here


[23-Jul-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	more players means more population , right?


[23-Jul-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	and more players also means more activity in our local market


[23-Jul-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	And if not new players , (griffonstone isn't the best place to start) , then at least we should have people wanting to set up second bases here


[23-Jul-22 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Magesty973**:	One of the issues we will have to solve is tax rates , as frost wood said


[23-Jul-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	well, right now the planet tax rate is the most inviting one you can have, as it's the lowest one possible


[23-Jul-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	and in terms of new player attractiveness, as a starting planet it's a bit fare away but it can work if the focus is on the correct production chain


[23-Jul-22 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	and last but not least, I thjink there was never a shortage in money blocking any expansion on Griff and the unemployment in the POPR makes it easy to expand bases/build new ones


[23-Jul-22 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	right now all the POPI is either donated by some residents, or in case there was the need the long standing residents have donated money and that has worked well from my perspective


[23-Jul-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	donated money isn't a great solution as what happens if these player quit?


[23-Jul-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	that's pretty simple and secure while I'm gov :)


[23-Jul-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	I've collected ~600k during my first term (as my economy was not yet so stable)


[23-Jul-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	the remaining ~1M is something I've payed personally (there is right now only the PFE donated by someone else)


[23-Jul-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	plus the investment of the ART and so on was coming from me


[23-Jul-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	and as long as I stay Gov and play actively, I'll continue to keep Griff in good shape :)


[23-Jul-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Well if you are donating as governor then that means you need to raise taxes.   The populations, happiness and unemployment rates all look good to me so no need to change anything with POPI upkeep.


[23-Jul-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	the structure of Griff was always depending on the donation of the residents and if it's working why change the system?


[23-Jul-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	and don't get me wrong, there is no problem for me paying the POPI supply, my economy is strong enough that it doesn't have a big impact


[23-Jul-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	so from my point of view there is no need try to change the POPI financing to a tax pased approach (which then everyone has to pay and considering the cost it will require a considerable raise)


[23-Jul-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	If you want to pay then I don't mind.  If it aint broke don't fix it.  But the tax system is there because everyone is supposed to pay their share.


[23-Jul-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	My vote is with OOG. They’ve provided a stable governorship so far, and a governor without PRO makes me nervous


[23-Jul-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Just do what the gov of Etherwind does.


[23-Jul-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	@Ogrebeef, taxes would have to be ludicrously high for that to work


[23-Jul-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	there's nothing stopping people from paying their fare share either. anyone can donate to popi if they so choose.


[23-Jul-22 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	What do you consider as "ludicrously high"? Similar planets that collect taxes generally have it set around 20-40.  Depending on the size of your base that is a few thousand a day per person which should cover all POPI expenses.


[24-Jul-22 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	They won't, I can tell you that!


[24-Jul-22 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I see you are governor of uv-796b.   I imagine upkeep for a broadcasting hub and 5 universites can be expensive.   How far off are collected taxes from fulfilling POPI upkeep?  As for Griffonstone, full upkeep for the current POPI buildings would cost about 1.5M/mo (right around what Pokter says was spent between taxes & out-of-pocket).  If taxes were set to 20 then revenue would be in the neighborhood of 3M/mo.


[24-Jul-22 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	the 1.6M were for 2 terms (as I'm now running for my third term), right now the popi including current level of programs cost 862k/m


[24-Jul-22 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	tax is per building per day, average production buildings per base ~ 15? and Governor only sees 50% of the tax?


[24-Jul-22 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Also the need to pay upkeep for Education buildings is normally secondary, when they are built they are first built for the passive education boost(the percentage of workers that are increased per tier per week), rather than providing education for happiness


[24-Jul-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Every week we used to get a couple thousand from GSO taxes, making the total tax somewhere around 20k. Even multiplying taxes by 10 only gets you 200k a week


[24-Jul-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Governor sees 100% of the tax

[24-Jul-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Yeah, I think I overestimated the per base revenue a bit.  Still, tax rate at 40 would probably do it.  Of course that is assuming the governor is in a 1 person corporation.  Pokter is in a large corporation and tax revenue is distributed to all members so he personally collects just 4% of the total.


[24-Jul-22 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Either way, taxes would have to be much more than 40 to support the POPI we need. Pretty much every governorship is a charity project. On Griffonstone, it's no exception. It's always been this way and I see no reason to change it now. If Pokter suddenly stopped playing, most people on this planet could provide more than enough money on their own to keep it running.


[24-Jul-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	sounds unstable if any of the big donaters pull out


[24-Jul-22 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I just don't understand the logic that says having 50 bases each paying 2% of the needed amount through taxes is somehow harder and more expensive than having one or a few people donating everything.


[24-Jul-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Considering the extra work involved, I don't think any governor should have to donate anything.  In fact, I think they should be getting a stipend.

[25-Jul-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	not that there’s anything wrong with NEM over OOG, but why elect someone who is going to take more taxes to do the same thing, and also can’t place buy orders if people want to donate or provide materials to the governor?


[25-Jul-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I am also stuck on Griff, does someone have 100 FF? Ad up on the LM


[25-Jul-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	@PiBoy314 - I am currently a non-pro governor.


[25-Jul-22 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...filled your FF order.


[25-Jul-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Why would a non-pro user need to collect more taxes to do the same thing?  Also, custom contracts is coming next week which takes care of the buy orders issue.


[25-Jul-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The collecting more taxes isn’t tied to the PRO thing. It’s just their platform. Higher taxes for the same outcome! Custom contracts are a PRO only feature. It will only exacerbate the difference.


[25-Jul-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You’re currently a non-pro governor of a small planet, not a major planet


[25-Jul-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Thanks for the FF.


[25-Jul-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	there's also the question of is NEM ready to coordinate the collection of the griffonstone tax portion of their dividends from their members after raising the taxes? 'cause if you're not in your own 1 person corp you'll only see a fraction of the taxes as governor.


[25-Jul-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it's a dumb system but it's what we have to work within.


[25-Jul-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	here is a question do we consider this a minor planet or major planet?


[25-Jul-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	(also I feel a bit of disrespect to small-planet governors).


[25-Jul-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it's the chemistry hub for the antares sector so fairly major I'd say. but that's all relative to location really.


[25-Jul-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’m a small planet governor too. Not meant as any disrespect, it’s just an easier job that can be better accomplished even if you don’t have PRO. I don’t see how a NEM candidacy would improve anything. All I see is I’ll be paying higher taxes with a governor who has fewer functions available


[25-Jul-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yall ready for a SHY?


[25-Jul-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Hey now, I'm a small planet GOV. I feel what Piboy is sayin though. It'd be much harder to work POPI inputs without pro.


[25-Jul-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Yes, pro does make it easier.  But it can be done.  Also, although you need pro to create custom contracts a basic player can accept them.  The main issue was with putting donation contracts on the LM which custom contracts does resolve.  In any case, I'm not advocating that we have a non-pro governor.  If there is a good pro candidate (which I'm sure there is) then that's great but we shouldn't count out a non-pro candidate for that reason alone.


[25-Jul-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	I wish they'd overhaul the POPI upkeep system anyway.  The whole thing is wonky, cumbersome, inefficient...and a few other unpleasant adjectives besides.


[25-Jul-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I don’t know, I think it’s fine for what it does: be a resource sink. The ADM programs however have turned it into just a minor inconvenience

**RiseofFilth**:	Congrats Mr. Z


[22-Oct-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Thank you, thank you. It was a hard fought campaign, running against myself.


[22-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	So, anything that I can do to help, with whatever powers my office bestows upon me?


[22-Oct-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	FYI -- if you want to catch my attention, Discord is something I'll see more often than here.


[22-Oct-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The only power a governor gets is to pay around twice as much in upkeep as you'll get in taxes


[22-Oct-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Wow, sounds like a winning job then!


[22-Oct-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I'll run it a couple of weeks and see what the cash drain is, then consider the tax changes accordingly.


[22-Oct-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I got cash to burn right now, so won't learn on everyone else's dime.

**Rento247**:	planning on making some fancy decorations ^_^


[21-Jan-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jan-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	We definitely need planetary festivities 3 this week. And more investment in POPI


[31-Jan-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Owwwwww. Yeah, that hurt a little, lol. Was really hoping this POPR would look like the last POPR. Going to take a bit to get staffed


[31-Jan-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	You all have to realize that we have added over 9000 settler jobs over 4 weeks. I don't know where this explosive growth is coming from, or if it will sustain.


[31-Jan-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	While I agree, max everything would help, I didn't expect this, and had no heads up it was coming.


[31-Jan-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Techs are also up over 2K, so it's going to take some time for the trickle up economy to settle. And that's assuming that we don't keep this growth spurt.


[31-Jan-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	is there anything we can do to help?


[31-Jan-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It looks like we're adding 2-3 new bases per week.  That probably accounts for half of the growth.


[31-Jan-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	there's an extent to which our growth is self perpetuating, right?


[31-Jan-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	since we've got the resources and the COGC to be in the supply chain for some of the safety station upkeep


[31-Jan-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	then our own demand pushes prices up and encourages more people to build here, rinse and repeat


[31-Jan-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i couldn't begin to guess to what extent that sort of thing impacts one planet


[31-Jan-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	and please excuse me for talking out of my ass.  i'm just thinking out loud here based on my limited knowledge of a mechanic i've never used myself.  i mean no disrespect to anyone who's been managing this stuff, only looking for a way i can fit into a solution


[31-Jan-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	in spite of the growth, the numbers look like they've stayed pretty consistent, so i assume that means that the safety numbers are in fact going up, just not quickly enough to keep pace


[31-Jan-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i need to upgrade my HQ to do it, but i could put an expansion in with BMPs to produce the OFF if anyone local with a POL can contract for PG and EPO.  I can even give some CL back once my base is paid off for the EPO


[31-Jan-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	upgrading would probably make sense though too, right?


[31-Jan-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	I would recommend to produce EPO yourself if you can, that stuff is hot commodity right now ^_^'


[31-Jan-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	in this exact moment, i'd say ideally it would be someone who already has a POL so i'm not adding to the already overtaxed demand for settlers


[31-Jan-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	plus others might be more liquid to support an additional POL whereas additional BMP would be easier for me to support at my level


[31-Jan-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	fair enough ^_^


[31-Jan-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	not that i'm against vertical integration in the long term :)


[31-Jan-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i gotta think part of the reason it's a hot commodity is because it goes into the OFF


[31-Jan-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	more like due rfabs


[31-Jan-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**citizenslave**:	if that's the bottleneck then i'm open to suggestions for where i'd be most useful


[31-Jan-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	CS, since we’re already planning a little back and forth, I can slip you a little EPO


[31-Jan-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It’ll have to wait until I bolt on the extra POLs I’m putting up, but that’ll be done within the day.


[31-Jan-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	cool.  i'd need PG too and time to set up BMPs to do anything useful with any of it


[31-Jan-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i'm in the process of liquidating my CX trades so i can get some construction materials.  upgrading my HQ has to be first cuz i'm capped on permits and on area here

[01-Feb-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I appreciate the thoughts, input, and especially donations towards grow infra! It's a community.ing


[01-Feb-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	When I took on the gov role, I said that I'd cover all of the maintenance costs out of pocket, then bring taxes up to where it wasn't too much of a bleed from my personal piles of cash. I think we're there.


[01-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	However, my actual bottleneck now is personal time. I'm down to one session a day in PrUn, so not all that efficient in getting needed goods to planet and allocated these days.


[01-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I honestly don't see that improving in the foreseeable future. So it's time to discuss a new approach so as not to hinder the planet's growth.


[01-Feb-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	If someone else wants to give the ole' gov spot a try, using the same policies, I'll happily step out of the way. If not, then maybe some system where certain people help me with maintenance and I compensate them directly?


[01-Feb-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Thoughts?


[01-Feb-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i don't know what your system is now, but i'd be happy to bring in supplies from CX under a supply contract so all you'd have to do is fulfill things and then put them into the upkeep

[02-Feb-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	The first order of business will be to solve the settlers issue. We have had approximately 1800 open jobs for the past 3 weeks. After that I will aim for ~10% unemployment across the board to make sure we have plenty of buffer for expansions and new bases.

***Ogrebeef-Backkicker** deleted this message.*


[02-Feb-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	There were 6 new bases last week. So far none this week but they tend to pop us as you get closer to the next POPR. The current Planetary Festivities II program will put a small dent in the open jobs. Running Planetary Festivities III a couple times after that will probably get us to 10% unemployment for everything.

**Zuul**:	So is festivities II locked in for the next POPR, or can it still go to III? Trying to decide if I should expand near the POPR or just stick a pin in it, and if we’re on 2 this week not much point in my expanding.


[02-Feb-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Yeah.  It can't be changed once a program is run.


[02-Feb-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	D’oh, how long is that locked in for?


[02-Feb-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	5d 20h (In [Planet Info] click [Local Rules] then [Programs]).


[02-Feb-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If by “context menu” you mean all the little buttons up top….those don’t exist on mobile


[02-Feb-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Looks like we have a candidate! Awesome. By current policies I was referring to the support financials.


[02-Feb-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Which is: the Gov pays for everything, ships everything as needed, feeds the infra, and then charges taxes roughly in line with their costs.


[02-Feb-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	Personally, I think that was easier for others, but if someone wants to change to more of a group based support model in exchange for lower taxes, I could get behind that too if well organized and fairly spread.


[02-Feb-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	I can look into upping Festivities from II to III for the next cycle, but TBH, don't understand why. Happiness at II seemed well about 50% in the areas needing growth.


[02-Feb-23 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because at the settler growth rate from Happiness 2 it will take the better part of 2 month just to fill the empty settler jobs assuming no one builds anything needed another settler? While under 3 it would take a couple weeks? That or I am horribly misreading the POPR's.


[02-Feb-23 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And yes, now that I'm home and can use the actual not mobile client, I can see the local rules. Those buttons are completely absent on mobile. For anyone else sharing my own previous personal hell, it's LR LS-300c in a new buffer.


[02-Feb-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To be more specific for why happiness 3 instead of 2. Migration "In" only occurs at 70%. 50% is the break point for people not migrating "out".


[02-Feb-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, in the last POPR with happiness 2, as a specific example, the planetary population decreased be 66 people. Literally no one moved to the planet at all.


[02-Feb-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That extra 10% over 70% happiness will make a huge difference


[02-Feb-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Migration in is proportional to the difference from 70%. So 80% has double the migration of 75%


[02-Feb-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Yeah, at a minimum, we need happiness above 70% to fill all the settler jobs in a reasonable amount of time. A short boost above that will just fill it quicker. Education should help fill the others, particularly once the higher tier needs are no longer capped by safety.


[02-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	it can (and should) be the governor paying out of tax revenues to maintain things, but that doesn't mean we should accept CX prices.  if we, as a "planet" develop businesses that can feed our POPI and provide them directly through contract, we can gain a steady customer and "the State" can get better prices than hitting CX for everything and needing to then also arrange to have it shipped back


[02-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	and i am not contesting the position, just offering suggestions if that is not already being done


[02-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	to whoever takes over


[02-Feb-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	even arranging shipping contracts to load our POPI supplies onto ships already coming from the CX with room in their holds can save some money and possibly help avoid any tax increases


[02-Feb-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	My plan is generally to run things pretty efficiently and cover some of it through tax revenues. I'm also backed by OOG which has good pricing for me on supplies I need.


[02-Feb-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Logistically, I can make a few things on-planet but I make regular deliveries for my base and several other regular customers, so I have lots of shipping capacity headed this way regularly.


[02-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Really, my entire business is basically logistics, hehe.

[07-Feb-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It is "supposed to" take units away to spread the supply. But the process that manages that is glitchy and does not always function as intended. If it were working correctly then @SeraphX2 would have a lot more than 448 settlers and I would have a lot less than 979.


[07-Feb-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Would it? I thought it took something like 25% of what you already have and pitched it into a pool and then round robbined them out to everyone? So if 25% of your workforce is less than what new people are getting...it should mean you would get capped back out in a round robin redistribution.


[07-Feb-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That's mostly it.  But the larger employer doesn't get included in round-robin until the smaller employers are at full employment.


[07-Feb-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I got 1x Settler when I set up my base a few days ago, even though there were 2k open jobs at the time


[07-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	For example, suppose I were on a planet by myself with 1000 settlers working for me then two people build bases and each create 500 jobs.  At the next POPR 25% of my workers would go into the pool bringing me down to 750.  Then any available workers would be distributed to the two new bases until they both have 500 workers.  At that point, if there are any workers left I would get them.


[07-Feb-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That is the simplest example.  It can get more complex but regardless of the scenario the process is basically the same.  Using the same example above except I only have 500 settlers instead of 1000.  At POPR I lost 25% bringing me down to 375.  Workers are distributed to the two new bases until they get to 375 settlers.  At that point I get included in the round-robin for the remaining available workers.


[07-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That doesn't seem like it can be intended to work that way. I understood it was just pure round robbin. If it actually worked that way, it's not that it would favor newer over older bases...it would just straight up hose everyone with a larger base while giving smaller bases full worker pools.


[07-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	@Doge the 2K open jobs is how many jobs there are with no workers. The last POPR before you came on was particularly bad, with no in migration. I did the numbers on it, and I think the entire temporary worker pool for settlers on that one (not per player, the whole thing) was 27 workers. So if you missed the POPR redistribution you wouldn't have gotten anything but 1 or 2 settlers.


[07-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	That is exactly how it is intended.  I have these discussions with players who have been around a lot longer than me as well as one of the developers (molp).  In fact, in an earlier iteration of the game there was no 25% limit on workers going to the pool.  100% went to the pool and larger employers were hosed even worse.


[07-Feb-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Huh, well, I won't argue over what the developers intentions are, but in function it certainly seems to be working as pure round robbin. Otherwise there'd be a lot of shrieking from the established players here as their worker pools just imploded instead of losing 1 guy =)


[07-Feb-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And I'd have been giggling like a loon when I maxed my base out after setting it down instead of still having a big worker hole after 2 POPR's


[07-Feb-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The thing is, not only are established large employers not getting hosed (as intended) but established small employers HAVE been getting hosed.  On one planet there was just me with 800 technicians and one other guy with 400.  Every time a new base gets built I remain at full employment and the other guy loses a big chunk of his workers.


[07-Feb-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is definitely glitchy as all get out...because no matter how it worked, pure round robbin or to lowest employer count they should get back to a state of full employment before you do.


[07-Feb-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Exactly.  I've observed numerous examples of things like that happening.  Molp is aware that it is a problem and he has been looking into it.  I don't know how much of a priority it is though as my discussion with him was about 3 months ago.


[07-Feb-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Anyway, regarding the settler shortage here.  The Planetary Festivities III program will add about 4k-5k new workers next week.


[07-Feb-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Agreed. I doubt there will be a shortage after this coming POPR. If we'd had the office supplies on the POPR before this last one the shortage wouldn't even be quite so bad now.

[12-Feb-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Pioneers and settlers are now quite a lot higher than any of the other places I have bases on, while the taxes on TEC/ENG/SCI are by far the lowest I've ever seen. So....dance a jig if you're employing engineers here I guess?


[12-Feb-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Although the specific prices for chemistry workers PIO/SET aren't out of the ordinary.


[13-Feb-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	I did hike the taxes a bit. I only gave the Chem taxes a bump to more cover the costs of the inputs. The others are unchanged from what they were. I'm pumping a good bit of cash into pushing the POPR higher quickly to solve the lower POP levels and keep them solid. We have had nearly 2k open Setter jobs for 3 POPR and the most recent was nearly 4k open Settlers, so we are headed in the wrong direction. Even Tech has been trending more open jobs and we have nearly 1k now.


[13-Feb-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Even after raising them, the chem prices for PIO/SET aren't out of the ordinary, as you mention.


[13-Feb-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	I'm planning on taking stock after the next POPR in a couple days and seeing where we land. The taxes were definitely out of line with other similar planets, particularly at higher tiers. This was just a bump in Chem to get it closer to normal. It was very low.


[13-Feb-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As long as you get 70-80% happiness, whatever method you go to do that, I think you will have satisfactory results


[13-Feb-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but then again, Upkeep cost and taxes aren’t really comparable when in a group tax collection methodology


[13-Feb-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	point is. Get settler happiness above 80% and the rest will take care of itself


[13-Feb-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	I agree. That's the main thing I have been focused on.


[13-Feb-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	I just put the last BTA in the safety station upgrade and dumped all the supplies into both the safety station and infirmary. I have also set Festivities III to be the next program.


[13-Feb-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	This next POPR will not fully reflect all the updates since I've only made some of them since I became governor a few days ago. Also, the current Festivities II doesn't end for another 2 days so the higher level program won't start until then.


[13-Feb-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	The POPR after that should be pretty solid though in terms of happiness. We have a pretty big deficit though. The latest POPR we were down almost 4k settler jobs, so that will take a little bit to fill up even with all the happiness being pumped into the infrastructure.


[13-Feb-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	True happiness depends on the past 4 weeks of upkeep so it might take a while longer


[13-Feb-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	I do know the most recent week is heavier weighted than the previous 3, but that is definitely true


[13-Feb-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yea the weighting is something like 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, for the most recent 4 weeks, most recent being 40%

**Zymgie**:	Oh, NOW I learn this ... :-)


[13-Feb-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zymgie**:	On taxes, I kept them low on chem to encourage people to use all available land for what god intended Griff to do. For higher end, I employ a good chunk myself, so didn't want to pay myself high taxes :D

[14-Feb-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**citizenslave**:	same


[14-Feb-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	we need to get a shipper


[14-Feb-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i'm pretty sure i have one


[14-Feb-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	we haven't actually done a run yet


[14-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	but as i said, we were just gonna dump it on the MM and split the proceeds


[14-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	if you've got a better option for where to ship it and what to do with it when it gets there, i'm certainly listening


[14-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'd buy it higher than MM but lower than the sell orders if you were to sell to me


[14-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(at moria)


[14-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	well if i ever end up shipping it myself, i'm definitely down for that


[14-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	idk where they'd be wanting to ship it at this point and if it makes less sense even for above MM to shift from ANT to MOR


[14-Feb-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I mean, shipping it to any CX (with your business partner) would also work


[14-Feb-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Just'd mean a 50% yield instead of 100% since profits are split + higher prices than MM on Moria


[14-Feb-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	if you can take it at any of them and still above whatever the local MM is, then i see no reason not to do that


[14-Feb-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	but a contract on ANT for a price above MOR and below ANT would be silly at that point


[14-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I might take your friend's offer if you guys let me join


[14-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	like i said, i'm behind it, but i don't know the exact details of their planned logistics runs, so i'm not sure where they meant to take it


[14-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	or if they have room for a bunch more


[14-Feb-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	but they're doing the logistics run, not generating any of the NA, so if space is the issue, i should just move one of my ships here to take over the runs for the two of us and they can use their logistics for something else


[14-Feb-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	seems like a good idea


[14-Feb-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmm... keep me updated on this as things change, I'm still interested in both ideas


[14-Feb-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i'm following up now and will do so


[14-Feb-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	@Dehzhas - that open jobs number represents the number of unfilled jobs BEFORE the POPR ran.   All of those jobs have been filled and there are currently 3759 unemployed settlers.


[15-Feb-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	WTB 6x2 BDE, 3000 AIC/u. Add's are at LM


[15-Feb-23 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I feel like the population report is filed by a bunch of lying sacks, lol. Comes out and says there are thousands of unfilled jobs. Toss down a few new buildings and it hands me 300/300 settlers for my new buildings.


[15-Feb-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	It comes down to the fact that the population data takes some work to understand and properly interpret.  Some of the number in the report reflect current info, some reflect past info, and some is derived from a combination of past & present info.   The reason your new building were fully staffed is because there were 3759 unemployed settlers.  Until the next POPR each player can access up to 10% of those workers (in this case, that would be 376 workers).   If you try to construct another settler building you will probably see 76 in parentheses next to workforce indicating how many more settlers you still have access to.


[15-Feb-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, so the open jobs are the unfilled jobs from that time the POPR was generated and before new pops were added?


[15-Feb-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Correct.


[15-Feb-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	yeah, SHAITER (sp?) and i (mostly not me) worked out the math on the reserve and decided that it was being calculated by the difference between the unfilled jobs and the pop growth


[15-Feb-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	so the fact that you are able to hire any settlers at all right after POPR is evidence that there is actually a surplus, and the exact number of the surplus fits that math perfectly


[15-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	SHAITR*


[15-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	SCHAITR!


[15-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	yes, that one


[15-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	jeez


[15-Feb-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, technically --Schaitr-- just to be extra annoying when I draw up a contract


[15-Feb-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	ha, yeah


[15-Feb-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	but thanks to that insight i finally feel like i (mostly) understand the worker reserve pool and can predict with some level of accuracy how POPRs will go, if i wrote out all the math and whatnot


[15-Feb-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	oddly enough, there were some decent insights in the legacy tutorials, but even they're definitely wrong, because construction appears to allow any one play to claim the entire reserve pool if they do it quick enough


[15-Feb-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	? The ability of a single player should be capped to 10% of the reserve pool starting total for that period.


[15-Feb-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Example, there reserve pool here is 3759 for the period and I can take at most 376 settlers from the pool.


[15-Feb-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	"The" reserve pool....I swear I'm getting dementia. Keep using the wrong words.


[15-Feb-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	oh, yeah, you're right


[15-Feb-23 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	i'm only replyaing half the conversation in my head


[15-Feb-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**citizenslave**:	still, the legacy docs i was looking at just said "a small percentage"

[14-Mar-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What’s wrong with the POPI? Growth across all sectors, good unemployment buffer on PIO and SET. Growth against TEC open jobs is substantial….the only thing that doesn’t look amazing is ENG growth, and that’s not disastrous.


[14-Mar-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**jelutz77**:	Governor can change the rules to turn off facilities too


[14-Mar-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Running full buildings isn’t actually being a good governor. Sometimes you run them empty, sometimes you run them half full. Leaving them run full out all the time often just means you’re allowing excess population with no work for the, to pour in. That increases the amount of upkeep needed to stop outmigration. More upkeep means higher costs and higher taxes if they decide to pass along the increase.


[14-Mar-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You’re looking for “just enough” starvation for the peasants. Give them too much and they get uppity.


[14-Mar-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Hay all, the POPI report is vastly improved over the past couple cycles. However, at the end of this cycle, I will be stepping down. I'm going through a very demanding period at work and life in general and having trouble keeping up with Prun at the moment. I will be back in the game after a pause, but I am working on greatly reducing my logistics requirements at the moment.


[14-Mar-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The problem with trying to trim 'excess population' is that it's hard to do so for just the lower tiers of workers without negatively affecting higher tiers. Higher tier upkeep cannot exceed lower tier upkeep categories and higher tiers don't grow from natural immigration, only education and programs. Education converts a percentage of the population of each tier to the next one, meaning that less population in one tier means less growth in the tier above it.

[21-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I see he said he was going to be busy, but last I checked, logging in once a week to press 2 buttons to enact a program isn’t that much an effort


[21-Mar-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, in fairness, I don’t actually know what the RL thing was that has them “busy” is. When my kid got sick and I had a few weeks stay in the PICU I left over a hundred gamers high and dry with little more than a “sorry guys, shit came up, gone for awhile”. It might be inconvenient, but real life happens, and sometimes you really don’t have the time or mental energy to “come online and hit two buttons”. While it’s possible they’re just being lazy af…..they may have more going on then you realize.

**Lanshara**:	what's with the open jobs?


[01-Jan-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	They should be filled in 18 hours.


[01-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the only open jobs after the last popr are scientists, the way popr shows the numbers is confusing


[01-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	open jobs is pre-change, so if the change is more than the open jobs, there aren't actually any open jobs


[01-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	ie: as of the last popr, there were 24 unemployed engineers (75 - 51)


[01-Jan-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	if they are employed then the job wouldn't be open


[01-Jan-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	they were unemployed the second before the popr dropped, and employed the second after


[01-Jan-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	it could certainly do with some improvement in how this information is presented, it’s not particularly intuitive


[01-Jan-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	if that is the case, what is the point in displaying out of date info? The jobs are filled by the new workers


[02-Jan-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The open jobs are used to calculate the new workers added. So by the time they're calculated we don't know how many ENG will be generated


[02-Jan-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	They could do another round of calculations to find out an accurate number, but that's misleading as to which numbers were used when calculating the POPR


[02-Jan-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But roganartu is right, I'm wrong: Those jobs have already been filled


[02-Jan-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I empathise with the difficulty in presenting the information in a useful way. There's two considerations, I think: 1) how many open jobs were there when migration was calculated, and 2) how many open jobs were there after migration was calculated. I think it is important to display both, but I do think that (2) is more important and currently less obvious (as it requires you understand the mechanic and then calculate it yourself)


[02-Jan-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the reason the number of open jobs pre-migration is still somewhat important to display is that it influences migration, where open jobs puts some upwards pressure on migration

**FreshFromage**:	what determines the max warehouse units per company? is it tied to the warehouse level or is it a decision made by the governor?


[20-Feb-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's determined by the warehouse level and is equal for every player. Every odd level adds another max unit so if you wanted to increase Griffonstones max warehouse level then you'd need to upgrade the warehouse twice.

**RiseofFilth**:	Hello good chemistry people of Griffonstone. I'm Rise and I currently govern on Hephaestus in Antares I for the past 20 terms and currently manage about 17 or so planets in Antares and its surrounding space via proxy governors. If you were unaware, a patch was deployed today that radically changes the way elections and governing operates in PrUn. What was once a benevolent dictatorship is now a power sharing among the highest voted members of an elected Parliament. I am unsure how the Devs heard players request "Let us gov multiple planets" and then decided that it was a good idea to impliment, "You need click 20 buttons and get to have 1-4 other people to click yes to pass a single change", but here we are. I'm not seeking to disrupt the status quo here on Griffon, as I think Neth_Havoc has done a consistently good job in managing the planet. Just looking to be an Parliamentarian, an observer, and to offer advice where I can. I appreciate any vote!


[26-Jun-24 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To vote, simply go to "ADM LS-300c" and choose a candidate! Remember, top 3 get elected into the Parliament, with the most votes being the Governor.


[26-Jun-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	On the plus side, it allows other players to shoulder the burden of governorship. And to spend a lot more time on politics than we were to date.


[26-Jun-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I too, would like to present my case for being an MP.  I make a lot of EPO and PG here, and would like the opportunity to help Neth_Havoc in his tasks.

[22-Dec-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You should clarify a bit more.  It looks like you are buying it at a 4CIS discount from the CX price (25/u).   It's not likely that someone would pay 5/u to get rid of their N but selling it for 21/u is actually a very good deal.


[22-Dec-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep, exactly right.  it was mentioned to me that maybe 21/u is too high so don't be surprised if you see some additional lower priced contracts too

**SilentReaper**:	Honestly, it kinda pisses me off... the pop issue. Because it's not even just only Griff. Almost every single planet OOG governs in the region is either losing higher tier pops or has open positions. Phobos is literally the only planet that has healthy pop growth from what I can tell. It's time for everyone to move out to IA-151 and 158.


[12-Apr-25 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We've got half a dozen bases we wanted to put down in ANT that we not can't because they would be missing pops for months at this rate.


[12-Apr-25 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I've noticed similar, but it's not all OOG. I think Neth particularly has disengaged from playing sometime this last governance cycle


[12-Apr-25 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Could be. I don't follow it all that closely. All I notice is that there were pops and now there aren't. It's a mass genocide haha.


[12-Apr-25 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I had to intercede on a couple different planets after the pops started mass-emigrating.


[12-Apr-25 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Hello fellow Griff citizens. I've honestly come to realize I don't even really want to engage with the political aspect of the game too much. Especially not in ANT given I am primarily base in BEN. But out of necessity, I feel like I have to run for the governorship on Griffonstone.  I have a lot of patience for governors. It's not a simple task, and I very much appreciate the work that goes into taking care of a planet. But this last popr on Griff was the final straw for me. Planets across the board in ANT are hemorrhaging higher tier pops. And I don't know about any of you, but it has put a stopper in our plans in FIOC at least.  So I am asking for your vote on Griffonstone this next election. If I won, I would mobilize the vast resources FIOC possesses to get the planet back on track. While OOG has to worry about the financials, we do not. We do not care about money or profit. To demonstrate this, I won't take a single penny in return for the upkeep materials I will inevitably dum


[12-Apr-25 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	p into the planet. In stead, I will invest the tax income into developing the planet's infrastructure so shedding a fifth of the entire ENG population doesn't happen again (hopefully).  Once all positions are filled, and the bases we had originally intended to put down ourselves have 100% pop fulfillment, I would relinquish my place as governor and let someone else take over. I am happy to work with anyone and everyone. And if people would like to sell materials for popi infrastructure, I'm sure we could come to some arrangement. Particularly prefab units to any of you with UPFs out there.


[12-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	I'll be voting for / supporting Silent Reaper. The current state of Governance on this planet (and others in the region) is unacceptable. I strongly advise people vote for Silent Reaper in 12 days when the election starts.
