Hello, I was told to come here in regards to the ADI grants to new players


[29-Jun-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @shrewdsun_88540  I think I remember you! It looks like you are back with a fresh corp and a COLIQ?


[29-Jun-24 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can hook you up with a grant!


[29-Jun-24 12:51 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Thanks, yeah restarted playing about 2 weeks ago.


[05-Jul-24 09:24 PM] puncher23#0000
Hello so the plan for Nike is to maximise its natural resources and build up a big construction base with MK2 and work on up to ship parts eventually.  I have a ship docking at Antares station in 3.5 hours 🙂


[05-Jul-24 10:43 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok here is what i have planned since they said i can add it

[06-Jul-24 12:40 AM] jvaler#0000
you can build quite a bit more than this with 750k, but i like the plan. though you should probably ditch the EXT in favor of more PP1/PP2 because @avalock actually has a dedicated LST mine on nike already that they sell to #internal-offers and to the LM

i'll go ahead and send you a cont for the grant


[06-Jul-24 12:41 AM] puncher23#0000
Ok thank you i am 7 minutes out from docking i was going to do the LST mine to feed the pp1 but were flexable 🙂


[06-Jul-24 12:42 AM] jvaler#0000
you can keep the EXT if you really want, but afaik avacyn would like more customers lol


[06-Jul-24 12:43 AM] jvaler#0000
that and looking ahead to when you'll have 5 experts, it's more efficient to stay within a single industry rather than having EXT that don't get the bonus from either experts nor CoGC


[06-Jul-24 12:43 AM] puncher23#0000
I am just trying to maximise income as mch as I can and this is one way for now I can EFFICIENCY tune it in the furture to synergize more with the whole  plan


[06-Jul-24 12:44 AM] puncher23#0000
I agree I think cogc should be able to have split bonuses tbh


[06-Jul-24 12:44 AM] jvaler#0000
i get that, just letting you know the opportunity is there to plan ahead for efficiency without the downside of having to buy expensive LST nor deal with the costs of shipping it in


[06-Jul-24 12:45 AM] puncher23#0000
roger we gotcha  ill modify the plan 🙂  I can import LST its a non issue tbh


[06-Jul-24 12:45 AM] jvaler#0000
once you scale up those PP2 with only starter ships i think that'll change :P


[06-Jul-24 12:46 AM] puncher23#0000
I am currently trying to learn the word..PATIENCE ..lol

[06-Jul-24 12:52 AM] puncher23#0000
thanks again very clever way to transfer funds.


[06-Jul-24 12:55 AM] jvaler#0000
yup lol


[06-Jul-24 02:31 AM] nyanism#0000
Moving both AL and LST to nike would surely be a pain with starter ship

another “fast buck” approach could  be Hephaestus,  as its fairly close and almost easy for shipping, extra is you can always ping rise and ask him if he need another base there, he usually up for sponsoring some project somewhere at any given time


[06-Jul-24 02:33 AM] puncher23#0000
I just use the lst with silicon to make the mcg for basic  pp1 stuff for my bases tbh  and I got a corp guy sells me lst at a good price so having the extracter was an idea but not a solid had to thing,


[06-Jul-24 02:33 AM] puncher23#0000
And basic in system seems to be priced to sell decently


[07-Jul-24 05:06 PM] jvaler#0000
@helminsted you're definitely still eligible for AGP

do you have any base plans in mind?

this was the template that was going to be used


[07-Jul-24 08:36 PM] helminsted#0000
sorry for late reply, also the template was supplemented by a starting funds of 2.7mill, 2mill of which was for the base infrastructure, and the 700k was for the supplies.


[07-Jul-24 08:37 PM] tanda#0000
that base in specific would be covered by the kevin loan


[07-Jul-24 08:37 PM] tanda#0000
was there another base in the near future you wanted? the AGP could be used for that


[07-Jul-24 08:38 PM] helminsted#0000
ah ok, well i was hoping for making a sort of base for my original profession of stl fuel refining, a base that would support that was my goal


[07-Jul-24 08:40 PM] helminsted#0000
as for the location, a planet was in mind that had all 3 ingredients on planet, but now i think i'll make a base that won't necessarily require that, in favor of a better location of the base.

the plan is blank for me...


[08-Jul-24 10:30 AM] helminsted#0000
I'm sorry 😞 I'm trying to figure it out


[08-Jul-24 10:33 AM] jvaler#0000
it's okay!


[08-Jul-24 10:33 AM] jvaler#0000
isn't ZV-759e a fuel refining planet though? do you plan on doing fuel refineries?


[08-Jul-24 10:38 AM] helminsted#0000
yes, i plan to source the resources on site and hopefully make a bunch of STL fuel for market


[08-Jul-24 10:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think prunplanner is being weird. I can't see anything


[08-Jul-24 10:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
even for my own bases


[08-Jul-24 11:24 PM] archielvahr#0000

[09-Jul-24 11:35 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Can I get a bit of feedback on my thinking here as I'm still pretty green.
Currently my base on Harmonia doesn't export anything, instead I've been focusing on arbitraging LM and CX's and importing only raw resources to produce consumables, prefabs & materials


[09-Jul-24 11:38 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
In about a week I'll have the resources to start a small base on Life and my thinking is that I'll move all my FP of Harmonia, build a couple Hydroponics and really focus on Harmonia being an agricultural focus.


[09-Jul-24 11:46 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
But my question marks are
- how difficult will it be to get workers to Life of various tiers (I don't understand the population mechanic)
- is transporting raw ag products to be finished elsewhere even a viable solution when considering the ship damage from the high pressure environment on Life
- Are there worlds out there that actually use a COGC food production efficiency thing? I can't find them 
- anything I've missed


[09-Jul-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Norwick is a good choice for food production - the planet search tool can be useful for that on prunplanner


[09-Jul-24 12:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since life is a hydroponics planet with some extra materials required, I wouldn’t build there yet. Not until you’re planning on doing more farming than you can do on harmonia


[09-Jul-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
Transporting the products isn’t too bad - they’re bulky, though. Transporting the output of a full 13 FRMs with starter ships is doable, but annoying


[09-Jul-24 06:46 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Thanks for the Prunplanner tip, I've been meaning to learn it. Why is Norwick a food processing world? Is it because it's got nothing else much going for it in any of its planets? I'd be nervous to invest in a planet JUST because of its current government program


[09-Jul-24 07:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, there’s lots of planets like that - sometimes COGC happens because of useful resources (like resource extraction on a rich ore planet), sometimes because it’s got no useful resources and it’s cheap to build on


[09-Jul-24 07:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you’re nervous, you can check the PLI for norwick and look at who votes what for COGC. It’s been a food production planet for as long as I’ve played


[09-Jul-24 07:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
It’s also very well established. COGC almost never changes on larger planets, so I wouldn’t worry about that too much


[09-Jul-24 07:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
For what it’s worth, it’s also cheap to build on (doesn’t need any special materials) and it’s reasonably close to Harmonia


[09-Jul-24 08:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
There'd be some serious pitchforks if any worlds changed COGC without a significant discussion


[09-Jul-24 08:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Norwick is just fairly close to harmonia and cheap to build on, and we didn't really have an FP planet in ANT, that's why we made it food processing.


[09-Jul-24 08:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
It was one of the first planets I remember us building up, back when I was a fresh-faced noob


[11-Jul-24 08:56 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Mm alright. When I've got a half a day to myself I'll sit down and learn PrunPlanner. But currently I'm thinking Ag products and carbon from Harmonia, oxygen and algie from Life and finished in Norwick for PPA/MEA


[13-Jul-24 12:55 AM] x_draak_x#0000
I'd like to request a grant


[13-Jul-24 12:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Do you have a pro license? And also I think we like to see a plan- Either something thrown together in prunplanner on a planet in ANT space, or a short description of what will be built where, and what the product you'd like to target is


[13-Jul-24 01:03 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Yes I have a pro license, I tried looking at prunplanner, but it just gave me a headache. So I'll just decsribe what the first bit of my goal is; after I figure out how to make a second base and get that up and running, I'll start producing crops there, some of which I'll turn into carbon, the rest I'll sell. The carbon will go to my first base for refining ALO


[13-Jul-24 01:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
Good enough for me, I sent a contract your way in-game


[13-Jul-24 01:04 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Ok! Thank you!


[13-Jul-24 01:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Others here can probably help out with those details - it's my bedtime now though 😄


[13-Jul-24 01:05 AM] x_draak_x#0000
haha ok


[13-Jul-24 10:40 AM] wolfking6116#0000
I think I'd also be interested in a grant.

Currently only a Free license. Somewhat considering grabbing Pro but I have some vague commitment issues when it comes to subscriptions 😅 

I haven't looked into prunplanner, but I'm doing things somewhat similar to Fiery_Ashes above. Started on Harmonia as a Victualler, with a small pivot into Carbon for some additional profit. Probably plan to expand those operations until I figure out any advanced or secondary works I want to delve into.

I really like the concepts of Exploration and Settling new areas, so assisting others with that directive is fairly ideal!

[13-Jul-24 02:51 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Alright so despite the excellent points made by Sidepipe and others, I'm already so prepared with MHL and other resources to make the jump to LIFE that I think I might as well do it. I spent ages on the planner and it seems to me with the level of prepped I am, I'll get revenues flowing faster as soon as I'm making ALG and PPT and THEN setting up base #3 in Norwick to handle all of the food prep when it gets out of control.


[13-Jul-24 02:52 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I'd use the grant to fast track the resources to set up a food prep base in Norwick maxamise efficiencies


[13-Jul-24 02:56 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Also Orchards seem pretty neat and I'd consider going full retired Picard-mode with a winery and space dog down the track

[13-Jul-24 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
May i ask why you have experts assigned to construction? I'm 70% sure INC is extraction but can't check


[13-Jul-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
INC is definitely extraction.


[13-Jul-24 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
You're extracting O here, what's the plan for that?


[13-Jul-24 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
Imo it may be better for you to abandon Life, move the HYF to Harmonia and then find a better suited planet for the FP and INC


[13-Jul-24 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
This would allow you to invest more experts into agriculture


[13-Jul-24 03:36 PM] jcheung#0000
Assuming you had intended the Life RIGs for H2O and not O, getting the RIGs and INC on the same planet would probably not be a terrible idea since they use the same experts


[13-Jul-24 03:36 PM] jcheung#0000
You would be able to ship water one way and raw agricultural products the other way


[13-Jul-24 03:37 PM] jcheung#0000
That being said, I'm still pretty new, so take that with a grain of salt


[13-Jul-24 07:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can't recieve private contracts until you have pro or basic, but just let me know and I'll send you one when you are ready!


[13-Jul-24 07:24 PM] jvaler#0000
~~these plans look good!~~ i'm sending u a cont for the 750k


[13-Jul-24 07:24 PM] jvaler#0000
actually wait i just saw what jcheung pointed out, i missed those O extractors


[13-Jul-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
definitely odd place for those considering the extra building materials required


[13-Jul-24 07:28 PM] jvaler#0000
okay i imported raw CX settings into your life plan and this ROI period looks pretty bad...

[13-Jul-24 07:29 PM] jvaler#0000
50-60d for a new player is not something i'd recommend


[13-Jul-24 07:30 PM] jvaler#0000
HYF are very expensive to build, they're more of a later game thing imo


[13-Jul-24 07:31 PM] tanda#0000
It is only 4 HYF, I would assume it's a jumping off point


[13-Jul-24 07:31 PM] tanda#0000
definitely should focus on something with better ROI, though


[13-Jul-24 07:33 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah it's a small amount, but each HYF is still bad ROI period


[13-Jul-24 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000
so it should probably go into other things, like 13 FRM and moving those FP to norwick

[13-Jul-24 07:47 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm willing to, for the moment, help transfer those funds via CX btw


[13-Jul-24 11:18 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Currently because I only have 2 Ag experts. As I get more I'll change that ratio to be more in favour of agriculture. I must've forgotten to change it for my future plans haha. Currently I'm producing my own prefabs as a cost cutting measure but it's not forever


[13-Jul-24 11:19 PM] jcheung#0000
well, having 2 construction does nothing for you with that design


[13-Jul-24 11:21 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
The O here I can give or take. I'm currently producing C on Harmonia so I was toying with the idea of having a smelting base too. To be honest they won't be built now I have the grant and can afford to fast track Life


[13-Jul-24 11:22 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
No doubt. Like I said, forgot to change after copy pasting current designs in the planner


[13-Jul-24 11:31 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
So when I plan out a similar investment into Norwick instead of life, I'm seeing a slightly lower ROI. So my thinking was to use the grant to expand on my plans in LIFE that I can already afford some of and kick start Norwick so I can extract more revenue from the raw products provided by Harmonia and Life


[13-Jul-24 11:31 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
And Harmonia will get the full farm stack the moment I can support all FP on Norwick


[13-Jul-24 11:40 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I've tried to best resemble a similar investment here, in a scenario where I go to Norwick instead of Life

[13-Jul-24 11:47 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
It's lower revenue because we're essentially just moving all revenue making from Harmonia to Norwick. Definitely a higher ROI though... however, I've already paid half of the construction cost on the Life plans before I knew what I was doing. So I'm thinking the secret sauce to higher Agriculture rev is Norwick coming third to finish some of the higher revenue providing products that can only be produced in HYF's


[13-Jul-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
🤔 i have something for you to consider


[13-Jul-24 11:50 PM] jcheung#0000
after you set your experts to max, if you swap your bea to the other recipe with 9bea/3mai/3nut


[13-Jul-24 11:50 PM] jcheung#0000
you can change your FP over to 2dw and 9 rat


[13-Jul-24 11:51 PM] jcheung#0000
and put out around 180 more rat per day


[13-Jul-24 11:52 PM] jcheung#0000
oh, oops i added FPs. let me take those off


[13-Jul-24 11:53 PM] jcheung#0000
restoring FP to 10 is no DW and all RATs 😁


[13-Jul-24 11:54 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
You're right, the DW doesn't make sense here


[13-Jul-24 11:56 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Luckily I'll be getting my 3rd Ag expert soon so that Harmonia would be able to keep up in this scenario w just RAT production


[13-Jul-24 11:57 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Anyway I can share the empire view page? We're still at ~$10k less profit than the Harmonia and Life plan


[13-Jul-24 11:58 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Which will jump further because I think the grant can take me to at least 4 FP on Norwick


[14-Jul-24 01:31 AM] evany.#0000
one thing i'd say is plan around 5 experts, they will come eventually regardless of your current state


[14-Jul-24 10:31 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Would you be interested in only issuing the grant if I committed to expanding to Norwick and taking the more traditional RAT production route?


[14-Jul-24 10:31 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Happy to commit to doing so


[14-Jul-24 10:54 PM] evany.#0000
Technically the grant is yours to do with what you will, but I would encourage you to heed the advice and seek it! 

What you’ve done so far is great it’s valuable to talk these things out.

I still get made fun of for stupid ideas!


[14-Jul-24 11:01 PM] jcheung#0000
and don't take anything i say to heart, i'm still pretty new overall


[15-Jul-24 12:23 AM] jvaler#0000

Hardly any of the grant is going directly towards a diamond encrusted grill and not plant bs

(thankyou all, where should I post progress updates)


[15-Jul-24 09:39 AM] evany.#0000
#associate-offtopic communal is general off topic / or bullshitting
#associate-planning for advice / group finding "hey lets make X ill do A who can do B and C"
#associate-office for general game topic

#channel-information for the above info


[15-Jul-24 09:40 AM] evany.#0000
though after writing that i'm a bit confused about the naming schema myself..  hmm

[15-Jul-24 09:52 AM] acramernc#0000
i think progress updates would go in #associate-office


[15-Jul-24 02:54 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
We need a #associste-communal-area-watercooler specifically for whispered slanderous gossip about COO Janet and the contractors refitting the window panes


[17-Jul-24 09:08 AM] jvaler#0000
that's about right. office also works for discussion about the server itself


[24-Jul-24 02:10 AM] finestone#0000
Hello everyone! Here are my Current Plans and the reason I am applying for the grant.
My main exports with this Setup would be TI, AU, SC, PE, STL, and PT. There would be other Excess Inputs to sell as well. Please let me know your Questions, Ideas, and Thoughts. Thanks! 

Up front Building Costs
Phobos Buildings 3xSME 1xBMP 1xCHP (1xHB1, 1xHBB) $187,010
Colony onto AU-605c (Titanium Ore) 3xEXT (1xCM, 2xHB1) $237,320
Colony onto QJ-650c (Gold Ore, Caliche, Rock Magnesite) 3xEXT(1xCM, 2xHB1) $251,720
Colony onto LS-231b (Limestone and BTS) 1xEXT 1xRIG (1xCM, 1xHB1) $184,980

Total: ~860k
Estimated daily profit: ~70k
ROI ~12days

HQ Upgrades  $92,495

I would also contemplate moving my HQ to a non faction (AU-605c or LS-231b) as i am not utilizing the electronic bonus of Phobos. Though I do need to calculate if its worth losing 10% efficiency bonus on Phobos. I could move some production buildings to the new HQ but then I will have a longer path to ship materials to the CX.

Future Projects

Colony on QJ-382g (Hydrogen and Ammonia) 2xCOL 1xEXT (2xHB1, 1xCM) $457,480.00
Later Building goals :
FS for BGO & BGC production.
ASM, POL, REF?


[24-Jul-24 02:24 AM] finestone#0000
Also if you think my export/imports needed are unsustainable or just the amount of shipping in general wont be possible please let me know and hopefully we can come up with a better plan.


[24-Jul-24 03:27 AM] evany.#0000
prunplanner has a hq upgrade cost calculator too

[24-Jul-24 03:36 AM] evany.#0000
regarding the 'plan' i'd e ncourage you to pick something and focus on it.. i definitely wouldn't be trying to upgrade HQ you will eventually want to get 3-5days of consumables minimum so consider all the fuel back and forth which starts to really matter if your only able to bring a bit of gold back and forth for example.

in general i'd encourage you to stick with 'base' items things like limestone has a consistent demand and lots of units moving everyday 
e.g you probably want to avoid gold 
while it might be more profitable than say LST but a quick look at the last 30days gold has only traded on 5 days, and only 3 of those trades were above 100 units! as a new player you can't sit on three weeks of supply waiting for a good sale because you don't have that buffer you need something that trades quickly so you get your profit so you can buy more ocnsumables 
comparatively LST moves more than 1k/units a day on average !


[24-Jul-24 03:37 AM] evany.#0000
to summarize i'd say
do less. build out full bases permit wise (300+ area) better building out one base than trying to spin up 5 bases with less than 20% area usage
make sure to consider if a base makes 50k/day it probably costs 10-15k/day for consumables.. so make sure for every 100k you have 30k saved for consumables
your just creating a logistical nightmare for yourself by trying to spin up - consider that you have to budget say its a cheap base costing 5-15k/day to run now lets pretend you built all 4 of those bases
- assume 15hours there 15 hour return flight
- if you drop 5days of consumables split 4 ways you need around 200k of consumables
- you only have two ships to supply your bases & starter
- your ships will be 'busy' more than 60% of the time just supplying these micro bases
- repairs & fuel of your ships will sneak up on you quickly.

other opportunities come up (i.e people looking for PE and INS producers) if all your base/hq is 100% usage you might miss really good opportunities!

blobjustright 

[24-Jul-24 04:21 AM] finestone#0000
okay thanks! I will focus on 2 bases and filling those out area wise before increasing HQ and expanding further.


[24-Jul-24 04:31 AM] finestone#0000
I was going to do these expansions slowly but you are saying with only 2 ships and low capitol this is too ambitious and i understand. I had included consumables in my calculations but not repairs and fuel


[24-Jul-24 04:32 AM] evany.#0000
i would honestly encourage anyone taking grant money to just build out 1 full base


[24-Jul-24 04:33 AM] evany.#0000
and to use #internal-offers to the best of your ability


[24-Jul-24 04:38 AM] finestone#0000
Thanks for the input! i will certainly watch that channel for possible contracts to fill.


[24-Jul-24 04:39 AM] evany.#0000
you'd be the buyer in that case, not the seller/filler


[24-Jul-24 04:39 AM] evany.#0000
many people offer consumables at much cheaper prices improving your numbers


[24-Jul-24 04:41 AM] evany.#0000
your of course free to sell there as well, but i wouldn't encourage that. im 100+ days old and don't keep enough supply to reliably sell to people. you will eventually get there mind you


[24-Jul-24 04:42 AM] finestone#0000
Ahhh that makes sense yeah maybe i can find a gold buyer 😛


[24-Jul-24 04:42 AM] finestone#0000
just kidding


[24-Jul-24 04:43 AM] evany.#0000
heres the thing and if you stick around i'm not promising this but i will tell you that alot of older players value permits so heavily


[24-Jul-24 04:43 AM] evany.#0000
that they will pay you to build you a full base mining something like gold with the agreement that you will sell to them for a specific period (30, 90 days) then continue to buy from you but your 'free' to sell to CX at that point if you want


[24-Jul-24 04:44 AM] evany.#0000
so if you had someone building, i dont know - something with gold.. they might actually say to you "hey, go mine me gold heres 2mil, ill buy at X rate for the next 90 days then after that w'ell do Y rate or you can sell elsewhere too."


[24-Jul-24 04:44 AM] evany.#0000
another reason that i say -- other opportunities come up and if your sitting at 100% permits used.. your gonna be like 'damn i wish i had the ability to take that opportunity'


[24-Jul-24 04:45 AM] finestone#0000
Makes sense!


[24-Jul-24 04:46 AM] finestone#0000
with regards to Internal offers


[24-Jul-24 04:47 AM] finestone#0000
Tanda has C 600/u, 25u/day so that is something that would benefit me so i could reach out to him.


[24-Jul-24 04:48 AM] finestone#0000
because i consume alot of Carbon and pay about 730/u atm


[24-Jul-24 04:49 AM] finestone#0000
Also all of his Construction goods are insanely good prices so i could build all my buildings from him


[24-Jul-24 04:49 AM] finestone#0000
is that the point of the internal offers assuming he has the stock 🙂


[24-Jul-24 04:51 AM] evany.#0000
so ill tell you what i do and ill tell you what you should do

what you should do:
setup contract to buy e.g 8 days worth so you can resupply every (idk, tuesday- whatever works for you)
then send a contract on saturday to leave ~48 hours to let it get fulfilled
then post in #trading "hey @finestone i sent you a cont for 150 gold" and they will fulfill it when they can. 

what i did:
is compiled a list of my consumables in a spreadsheet, set a time period and it tells me how much i need to buy for all my bases combined
then i dm'd all of them and cleared with them
'hey i need X amount a week is that OK? same advertised price or different?' 
then i put all that info in my spreadsheet and once a week i send a 10day contract for all my supplies- with the goal of getting to 30 days worth of supplies in a few months.
now i dont tag anyone i just send out the contract and won't DM / @ them unless its rejected since its all kind of 'setup'


[24-Jul-24 04:53 AM] finestone#0000
Nice Yeah i played Sim companies which had a very similar gameplay loop.


[24-Jul-24 04:53 AM] finestone#0000
is there an easy repeat contract button

👆 actualchadthink 

[24-Jul-24 04:54 AM] evany.#0000

[24-Jul-24 04:54 AM] evany.#0000
contracts are literal aids.


[24-Jul-24 04:55 AM] finestone#0000
thats unfortunate in SC it was an easy 1 click to repeat a contract with a player if they had fulfilled it and it just had a history list


[24-Jul-24 04:55 AM] evany.#0000
i just did this

[24-Jul-24 04:56 AM] evany.#0000
so now i open the CONT in view -> put the users name in 
select the user and hit send and it sends a copy


[24-Jul-24 04:57 AM] finestone#0000
now just imagine next to the fullfilled status it had a resend button 😄


[24-Jul-24 04:57 AM] evany.#0000
i honestly can't fathom how contracts are this bad after the game literally operating for years.


[24-Jul-24 04:58 AM] evany.#0000
but i digress too much on that topic


[24-Jul-24 04:58 AM] finestone#0000
all good


[24-Jul-24 05:48 AM] finestone#0000
So upon review would focusing on PT be okay? I looked through all of Golds building chains and understand how it would be slow to sell, thanks for that.


[24-Jul-24 05:56 AM] evany.#0000
yeah if the margins look good to you providing something like consumables is a great place to be because they definitely go.
respect the cogc though!

a lot of the time producing something wont happen when your starting
i.e  just looking at PT using BMP
1 STL  -> 5 PT
so you'd need a base where your extracting Iron
then another base smelting the iron ore into iron
that base can also turn the iron into steel
then another base with BMP to turn that steel into PT


[24-Jul-24 05:56 AM] evany.#0000
then you'd probably buy TRN from CX or a private seller to get better returns and make 2 extra PT


[24-Jul-24 05:57 AM] finestone#0000
Yes i would buy TRN and FEO


[24-Jul-24 05:58 AM] evany.#0000
you wouldn't want to setup smelters and then BMP because SME is a metallurgy cogc and BMP  is manufacturing


[24-Jul-24 05:59 AM] finestone#0000
well im on an electronics planet so that is irrelavent


[24-Jul-24 06:00 AM] evany.#0000
unfortunately i can't offer much guidance on electronics, havent even looked myself.


[24-Jul-24 06:00 AM] evany.#0000
i want to - though.


[24-Jul-24 06:00 AM] finestone#0000
yeah i understand if im minmaxing you should place buildings only on respective COGC


[24-Jul-24 06:01 AM] finestone#0000
they are still profitable W/O though


[24-Jul-24 06:01 AM] finestone#0000
Would making the TRN's be adding too much complexity?


[24-Jul-24 06:03 AM] evany.#0000
no i don't believe so


[24-Jul-24 06:03 AM] evany.#0000
especially if your only building enough to satisfy yourself


[24-Jul-24 06:04 AM] evany.#0000
you don't really _have_ to minmax and i realize some of the advice might come off that way
but it helps really to minmax your first few bases and you can be less efficient as time goes on, but ultimately that depends on your goal(s) 
i.e do you see yourself playing this next year etc


[24-Jul-24 06:04 AM] finestone#0000
i played sim companies for 4 years so yeah ill be playing awhile


[24-Jul-24 06:05 AM] finestone#0000
I enjoy the spreadsheet game


[24-Jul-24 06:05 AM] finestone#0000
I actually think a FS is way better and doing the SFK recipe


[24-Jul-24 06:05 AM] finestone#0000
for PT


[24-Jul-24 06:06 AM] evany.#0000
personally my approach has been keep it simple

everyone told me how bad single burn C is, after nearly 40 days of doing single burn i'm finally finishing the second stage of getting enough usable product that i will be able to do double burn


[24-Jul-24 06:07 AM] evany.#0000
within 30 days i hope to have that complete and switch to double burn full time


[24-Jul-24 06:07 AM] evany.#0000
nothing wrong with just starting raw steel


[24-Jul-24 06:07 AM] finestone#0000
True! but PT would be acceptable


[24-Jul-24 06:07 AM] evany.#0000
i'd personally suggest going with whatever gives you cheapest price per unit - forget the unit count per-se


[24-Jul-24 06:09 AM] evany.#0000
as younger players (including myself inthat) its nice not to have to worry about someone showing up and dumping 10k units randomly on the market for cheap because hes not gonna sell them at a loss and most players that are established and can afford to have 2  million dollars worth of units sitting around in a warehouse somewhere, are not gonna compete with me slow burning


[24-Jul-24 06:11 AM] finestone#0000
Is selling drones to MM bad?


[24-Jul-24 06:12 AM] tanda#0000
I think that one got nerfed pretty hard a while back, most people do EDC IDC now for MM shenanigans


[24-Jul-24 06:13 AM] finestone#0000
what is EDC IDC


[24-Jul-24 06:13 AM] finestone#0000
I just saw infinite Market maker is buying surgical drones


[24-Jul-24 06:15 AM] tanda#0000
EDC and IDC are software packages, they don't require any materials to make and sell for a solid amount of credits to the Market Maker for them


[24-Jul-24 06:16 AM] tanda#0000
downside is they require engineers or scientists, so the bases are expensive to set up and maintain


[24-Jul-24 06:16 AM] finestone#0000
so you dont think it would be viable to make drones


[24-Jul-24 06:16 AM] finestone#0000
as a long term goal


[24-Jul-24 06:17 AM] tanda#0000
I'm only aware of the changes to the market maker where drones are concerned. I can't say I've really done a deep dive on that production path


[24-Jul-24 06:18 AM] razenpok#0000
You could also make SAL in SD, there's a bit of a market demand right now


[24-Jul-24 06:18 AM] evany.#0000
jesus your not kidding.. they WRECKED it..


[24-Jul-24 06:18 AM] razenpok#0000

yeah that too. Steel after all, but its not true import he's just buying FEO i think

especially for such rubbish returns


[24-Jul-24 07:09 AM] razenpok#0000
... and 150 PT/day is almost 50% daily market share on AI1, which will probably push sell prices even lower

its alright- i spawned on deimos and i left the base - i only just 'filled it out' like two weeks ago it sat idle for six months

not idle but.. just tutorial buildings onit

Unironically, Promitor as a first base might be a good idea if you consider the fact that only new players can spawn on it rn


[24-Jul-24 07:23 AM] evany.#0000
you can demolish the buildings on it (production/extraction buildings)


[24-Jul-24 07:23 AM] evany.#0000
just leave the core module / residence buildings as they don't decay


[24-Jul-24 07:23 AM] finestone#0000
but what about the claim


[24-Jul-24 07:24 AM] finestone#0000
Permit"


[24-Jul-24 07:24 AM] evany.#0000
the permit ? ah good point.


[24-Jul-24 07:24 AM] evany.#0000
i guess you could demolish the core module


[24-Jul-24 07:25 AM] evany.#0000
lots of plots so you could go back if you wanted


[24-Jul-24 07:25 AM] evany.#0000
coliq'ing and switching to deimos start might be the best bet, though.


[24-Jul-24 07:25 AM] finestone#0000
cuz i cant spawn on vulcun or deimos right?


[24-Jul-24 07:25 AM] evany.#0000
you can spawn on deimos if you coliq

From what I see
- PP2: LDE, LBH, LTA. Extremely profitable, high-cost inputs, heavy shipping
- GF: RG, with a pinch of GLA and TUB. Very profitable, medium-cost inputs, light shipping
- BMP: SEA, EXO, REP, PWO, OFF. Very profitable, medium-cost inputs, medium shipping. Getting all the inputs might be a chore.
- FER: ALE, KOM, GIN. Very profitable, medium-cost inputs, medium shipping. Might need to supply farm goods yourself.
- POL: EPO, PG. Very profitable, medium-cost inputs, medium shipping.
- CHP: NS, CL with a pinch of MED. Profitable, low-cost inputs, heavy shipping
- FP: MEA, COF, RAT. Profitable, low-cost inputs, medium shipping.
- INC: C. Profitable, medium-cost inputs, heavy shipping.
- REF: SF. Profitable, high-cost inputs, heavy shipping

note that your HQ is currently giving an electronics boost. you don't have an HQ bonus, effectively so you wouldn't be losing 10% on phobos


[24-Jul-24 03:37 PM] jvaler#0000
lotta conversation that i'm not gonna read through :P, but just know that the AU system is considerably far away to be doing ore exporting. i'd highly recommend SE-648c instead for TIO EXT. it's not a triple green, but the distance is much shorter and it also happens to be one of the best O sources in the galaxy. (liquid resources are much more valuable than solid or gaseous resources because RIGs have a much higher extraction rate per area than either COL or EXT)

[24-Jul-24 04:26 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Hello, I'd like to apply for a grant. I'd mostly like to use the money to increase self-sufficiency, as I am currently importing a lot of resources that I have locally on Phobos, but simply cannot extract yet due to lack of capital. 

Right now, I have 3x BMP and 1x (soon to be 2) PP1. I would use the funding to build the following:

11x HB1 - 172k

2x Rig - 40k
5x Extractor - 140k

2x BMP - 49k
3x PP1 - 67k

3x SME - 89k
1x FP - 20k

Total - 577k

Since I am focusing on construction, the above costs will likely be significantly lower from supplementing my own produced materials. I'd use the remainder of the money for process improvements like building a CHP for flux, and eventually another base for lightweight prefabs.

Let me know if this seems like a reasonable plan.


[24-Jul-24 05:03 PM] finestone#0000
As far as I'm aware. Your HQ gives you a 10% efficiency bonus to all products on the planet its on. It also determines which faction bonus you receive. The COGC is separate and simply buffs the planet. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks.


[24-Jul-24 05:04 PM] finestone#0000
Thanks for your input i will review SE-648c and calculate shipping!


[24-Jul-24 05:06 PM] jvaler#0000
are these RIGs and EXT on phobos?


[24-Jul-24 05:08 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd really advise against that, resource extraction there is not very profitable. your return on investment period would be many weeks iirc

"self sufficiency" shouldn't be a goal you're trying to reach unless you're having issues with CX shortages. you need to be looking at the profitability of any given thing you're doing instead


[24-Jul-24 05:10 PM] jvaler#0000
and basically no tier 1 resources have actual shortages on the CX. they might sometimes get expensive, but never completely bought out and unavailable.

and if they get expensive, then it's good to produce yourself __but only because it's now profitable__. the reasoning is profit and return on investment, not "self-sufficiency"


[24-Jul-24 05:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Valid argument, but you forgot that things you make yourself are free

[24-Jul-24 05:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But yes I would agree, trying to go for self sufficiency is like living in the middle of LA and growing your own food, making your own clothes, and finding your own water source. Unless it's for fun/roleplaying which is completely valid

My plan with the rigs is to self-produce drinking water, and I wanted the extractors for mainly SiO for MCG production. When I look at the map, there doesn't seem to be any nearby star systems with large si deposits, and while I don't have a way to calculate the exact shipping cost, I can't imagine buying imported SIO from someone + their profit margin is cheaper than producing it yourself.


[24-Jul-24 05:25 PM] jvaler#0000
i think they're confusing the company HQ and the corporation HQ

@finestone your regular HQ doesn't give you a 10% boost to everything on the planet it's on, that's what the corporation HQ does. your regular HQ only determines where your global bonus comes from https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/headquarters/index.html#faction-bonuses

@shinonomesciences okay this is more correct. you should be aiming for <30d ROI period at most, so building EXT is a pretty inefficient use of money. SIO is cheap anyways, i buy it to make my MCG. there's dedicated SIO planets out there

basically everything is "cheaper" to produce yourself because you don't have to give yourself profit margins like you do when buying from others. that doesn't necessarily make them worthwhile to do yourself though because you should be giving yourself profit margins too

[24-Jul-24 06:03 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I was thinking of vertical integration to give myself more profit margin on my final product, but I suppose that that’s more of a mid game thing and high ROI should be my goal. I’ll resubmit a plan.


[24-Jul-24 06:14 PM] jvaler#0000
that's actually a late-game thing, due to what i said about self-sufficiency only mattering when dealing with CX-scarce items. that only really applies to higher tier stuff like ingredients for AFABs.

vertical integration doesn't change your profit margins at all, it just changes how you interact with the CX. anything you make within that vertical integration chain could be stopped right then and there and sold to the CX for a given value, so no money is actually "saved" in the process of further processing those items. things don't cost less to you just because you make them yourself is what i'm trying to say


[24-Jul-24 06:17 PM] jvaler#0000
1 C will always cost 1 C, no matter if it was bought off the CX or burned in your own INC


[24-Jul-24 06:18 PM] jvaler#0000
and it's monetary value equivelant is dictated by whatever the current market status is


[24-Jul-24 06:20 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
This only holds true though if 1) the spread on the material is basically nil and 2) shipping the input product is basically free because you have a substantial volume of trade in the other direction


[24-Jul-24 06:22 PM] jcheung#0000
If you VI, what you need to do is add all your support bases (or fraction of a base if it only partially does things for the parent) to the main base, which means add all the costs from workforce, feedstock... or just the gross income, cost and profit, then average it. That's your per-base profit.
If the final base makes you 140k/d but the feeder bases cost you 10/d and you have 2 of them, you actually only make 40k/d per base.... which is still respectable, then you also have to take out gas cost


[24-Jul-24 06:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
1. Most people from what I found use Ask/Ask prices, meaning they always sell as ask orders and buy from ask orders too. Buy orders aren't typically worth it unless you are in a rush or desperate


[24-Jul-24 06:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also on some stuff like DW because the spread is very small


[24-Jul-24 06:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
2. The shipping really costs very little in credits compared to revenue. The time it takes can limit you but it will also apply to self sufficiency if you don't build everything on one planet


[24-Jul-24 06:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And you typically wouldn't build everything on one planet because CoGC bonus and experts are wasted


[24-Jul-24 06:29 PM] jcheung#0000
I do buy from ask and sell to bid for plannin purposes


[24-Jul-24 06:29 PM] jcheung#0000

[24-Jul-24 06:31 PM] jcheung#0000
I mean I'm also... less than a month old, but i do this so that if the market takes a turn for the worse my projections keep my expectations somewhat close-i still try to sell at ask


[24-Jul-24 06:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Which kind of actually really worked out for me in the case of NL, that shit crashed hard


[24-Jul-24 06:35 PM] jvaler#0000
yup this is the use-case for sell to bid, for people without the liquidity to wait for asks to sell in time


[24-Jul-24 06:35 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
That does make sense


[24-Jul-24 06:36 PM] jcheung#0000
Even as is though, NL crashing still managed to put me behind on loan payments because the bid price also dropped and as jvaler said i don't have the liquidity to wait


[24-Jul-24 06:37 PM] jcheung#0000
Thankfully the lein holder was understanding


[24-Jul-24 06:37 PM] jvaler#0000
most players warehouse all their items at the ANT warehouse, so you'd be shipping it regardless. shipping costs are a small fraction of an items cost most of the time anyways.

for the spread though, how would that make what i said untrue?


[24-Jul-24 06:45 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Theoretically, if you produced the material yourself vs buying at the CXL, the spread on the material would be added to your profit margin, no?


[24-Jul-24 06:46 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Granted, this doesn’t really apply for the materials I was trying to produce, given that the margins are so minimal


[24-Jul-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
it wouldn't, because you shouldn't sell to bids(if you can help it). on most goods bids have very little volume and are often severe lowballs


[24-Jul-24 06:50 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why ask/ask prunplanner settings are so popular. that plus we're too lazy to place bid orders for stuff we need ahead of time lol

even without warehouses you can post ask orders on the CX and it holds your items in CXOB limbo


[24-Jul-24 07:11 PM] finestone#0000
Sometimes preference for VI is okay too! You are more stable and have opportunities to adapt to market conditions. This games doesnt punish switching industries though since there is no build time and no loss of goods from demolishing so no real benefit.

{Reactions}
✅ 

[24-Jul-24 07:13 PM] jvaler#0000
well buildings do degrade over a 182(?) day period, so you get less refunded the longer you wait. so there is loss of goods


[24-Jul-24 07:13 PM] jvaler#0000
but that's degradation that you'd have to repair anyways so it's not really a big deal


[24-Jul-24 07:13 PM] finestone#0000

yeah... nvm my point is moot lol


[24-Jul-24 07:14 PM] finestone#0000
If there was a loss of 50% when demolishing there would be more of a penalty. The biggest "cost" in this game seems to be maximizing COGC bonuses


[24-Jul-24 07:15 PM] jvaler#0000
mm yeah


[24-Jul-24 07:16 PM] jvaler#0000
i suppose you could consider having to re-accumulate experts could be a cost?


[24-Jul-24 07:16 PM] jvaler#0000
depending on each base's building count that could be a considerable amount of time

Very true so VI would have a much more resilant and adaptable profit to changing market conditions that isn't going to be calculated appropriately in PrUn


[24-Jul-24 07:19 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm, cause any calculation you do is just a snapshot of the current state of the market


[24-Jul-24 07:19 PM] finestone#0000
Yepp but at the same time ROI for newer player should still be the focus as we don't have a large impact on market conditions


[24-Jul-24 07:20 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah, tier 1 goods don't have to worry about stuff like that as much as tier 2 and above


[24-Jul-24 07:20 PM] jvaler#0000
and VI doesn't eliminate market fluctuations, it just limits their impact to the end product


[24-Jul-24 07:22 PM] finestone#0000
Well its doesn't eliminate anything the idea could be adapting if carbon spikes stop using the carbon you produce and start selling it


[24-Jul-24 07:23 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah you'd do that if the thing you're turning the carbon into hasn't adjusted to the newly raised carbon prices yet

[24-Jul-24 07:24 PM] jvaler#0000
from what i've observed of the markets, there's always some delay in these things. so if you stay ahead of the waves you can definitely squeeze out an advantage


[24-Jul-24 07:24 PM] finestone#0000
If carbon stays high for extended time the margins may become greater for end products as non VI companies struggle for margin


[24-Jul-24 07:24 PM] finestone#0000
Then you would resume production of the end product for greater overall margin


[24-Jul-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
the thing is do you want that end product base sitting idle for that whole time?


[24-Jul-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
ohh hmm, actually you may be able to just switch recipes depending on the building


[24-Jul-24 07:25 PM] finestone#0000
That is a downside hopefully though that building can produce something else in the meantime


[24-Jul-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
that's one of the strengths of BMPs for example


[24-Jul-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
yea


[24-Jul-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
but for something like PP2 it'd be much harder cause basically everything uses AL


[24-Jul-24 07:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i know that put a lot of nike PP2 people in a tough spot when AL started spiking a month or so back


[24-Jul-24 07:27 PM] jvaler#0000
and bfabs have always been capped by the market maker unfortunately, so they can't really raise in price to meet the new AL cost


[24-Jul-24 07:28 PM] finestone#0000
Yep and that is the fun part about market games!


[24-Jul-24 08:36 PM] finestone#0000
So I found some time at work to take a look at SE-648c certainly expensive upkeep and setup since double red. Liquid oxygen is very cool though. I think my plan will be setting up my smelting base on WU-070A so shipping the ore would be much shorter than all the way to A1 and the weight is about 200 per day. Do you think that will be manageable?


[24-Jul-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
WU-070a could probably just have on-site SIO EXT, afaik that's what others do


[24-Jul-24 08:41 PM] finestone#0000
Well I still want to do the AU tio mine was my question


[24-Jul-24 08:50 PM] jvaler#0000
ahh


[24-Jul-24 08:50 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that'd work i suppose? certainly unique


[24-Jul-24 08:52 PM] jvaler#0000
though you'll still have to be flying ANT -> AU, the ore export can just be shorter


[24-Jul-24 08:52 PM] finestone#0000
Thats going to be my current plan then. Maybe some SD on phobos with the profit


[24-Jul-24 08:53 PM] finestone#0000
Supplies can be funneled through WU070 aka 1 ship going between au and wu and my other ship funnels between A1 and wu


[24-Jul-24 08:54 PM] jvaler#0000
yup


[24-Jul-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm guessing not 100% of your starter's shipping capacity will be used for WU-070a <-> AU-605c, but that's fine. gives you some leeway in keeping up with it


[24-Jul-24 08:55 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe... idk the actual numbers


[24-Jul-24 08:56 PM] finestone#0000
Thats true trips to AU will not be as full. As ill have to pull ore every 3 ish days


[25-Jul-24 02:33 AM] finestone#0000
I have upgraded to Pro and would like to apply for the grant.

Plan
1 - Upgrade HQ 1 level (Need 1 more permit) $32k
2 - Demolish 2HB1 2SME on Phobos (Keeping CM)
3 - Build onto WU-070a (1xCM 1xEXT 6xSME 4xHB1) $400k 
4 - Build onto AU-605c (1xCM 5xEXT 3xHB1) $322k
5 - Move HQ to WU-070a (Better COCG, Faction Bonus, and shorter Ore transit time)
6 - Profit selling TI and max out WU-070a Area with SME
7 - Start a new production chain on Phobos (Software? Chemistry?) 

Initial Build Out can be down with 1 ship and my other ship will have supplies.

WU-070a (40xBBH 32xBDE 60xBSE 4xBTA 4xLDE 4xLSE 4xLTA 768xMCG 12xPSL 8xTRU)
Total Volume    221.60 t Total Weight    231.28 m³ 
AU-605c (12xBBH 6xBDE 86xBSE 3xBTA 4xLDE 4xLSE 4xLTA 720xMCG 12xPSL 8xTRU)
Total Volume    168.00 t Total Weight    210.66 m³ 
 
Estimated ROI ~7-10 Days (Travel Time + Sell Time)

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

[25-Jul-24 02:36 AM] jcheung#0000
🤔 TAI has pretty low market volume


[25-Jul-24 02:37 AM] jcheung#0000
if you intend to sell that to CX you'll likely saturate it quite quickly


[25-Jul-24 02:37 AM] jcheung#0000
just a fair warning


[25-Jul-24 02:37 AM] jcheung#0000
though that planet is pretty good for SIO so you might be able toeasily swap over if needed


[25-Jul-24 02:44 AM] jcheung#0000
605c and 070a are pretty far apart


[25-Jul-24 02:44 AM] finestone#0000
That is true the market for TAI is almost non existent though having orders up at the right price may change that but it feels like 1 extractor should be worth it?


[25-Jul-24 02:48 AM] finestone#0000
Yes 2 day trip at lowest fuel so 4 day turn around which should be about right for full loads of ore.


[25-Jul-24 02:49 AM] jcheung#0000
if you're dead set on SME at 070a, instead of 605c, may i suggest SE-648c? it's closer in general, and also allows you to make a more efficient loop. ore -> smelter -> cx -> ore -> repeat in a literal circle


[25-Jul-24 02:51 AM] jcheung#0000
granted the startup costs will be higher on 648c


[25-Jul-24 02:52 AM] finestone#0000
that is what i was worried about but maybe the saving on fuel would be worth it + liguid Oxy


[25-Jul-24 02:52 AM] jcheung#0000
yes, since you need O to smelt as well


[25-Jul-24 02:52 AM] finestone#0000
jvaler also suggested that location.


[25-Jul-24 02:53 AM] jcheung#0000
now, another option for SME would be literally in the same system


[25-Jul-24 02:53 AM] jcheung#0000
648a


[25-Jul-24 02:54 AM] jcheung#0000
though, again, startup costs are higher


[25-Jul-24 02:54 AM] finestone#0000
i do like that


[25-Jul-24 02:54 AM] finestone#0000
let me analyze how much more these start up cost are


[25-Jul-24 02:55 AM] finestone#0000
will the upkeep really hurt though?


[25-Jul-24 02:55 AM] jcheung#0000
you won't feel the repairs for i think at least a month, maybe two? not sure. haven't hit my first repair yet


[25-Jul-24 02:58 AM] finestone#0000
250k more just for SME planet


[25-Jul-24 02:59 AM] jcheung#0000
huh. may i ask why you want to go for TI smelting?


[25-Jul-24 02:59 AM] jcheung#0000
you'll make oodles more with the raw ore


[25-Jul-24 03:00 AM] finestone#0000
Repairs only eat about 9% output so losing ~5k daily


[25-Jul-24 03:01 AM] jcheung#0000
the profit gain using smelters to refine the ore is pretty small, and the TIO market is turning over quite a lot


[25-Jul-24 03:01 AM] finestone#0000
so fuel would cost about the same


[25-Jul-24 03:02 AM] jcheung#0000
sure, but if you scale up to full bases...


[25-Jul-24 03:03 AM] jcheung#0000
you get to move the cargo a lot faster


[25-Jul-24 03:03 AM] jcheung#0000
well


[25-Jul-24 03:03 AM] jcheung#0000
anyhow


[25-Jul-24 03:03 AM] finestone#0000
as far as refining ore preference and I think will prove profitable


[25-Jul-24 03:03 AM] jcheung#0000
let's go back to your plan here since 648 doesn't seem appealing to you


[25-Jul-24 03:04 AM] finestone#0000
im not saying it doesnt work


[25-Jul-24 03:05 AM] finestone#0000
im just saying up front cost is substantially more but the rate is the same but yes in the long long run full bases would be more benefitial


[25-Jul-24 03:06 AM] finestone#0000
my thoughts were local markets bigger/more ships more planets would also help?


[25-Jul-24 03:08 AM] finestone#0000
and the TI market looks just as healthy as the TIO market imo


[25-Jul-24 03:11 AM] jcheung#0000
instead of starting up two bases out the gate and having two partial bases, why don't you temporarily place SMEs on 605c? you can do 5 EXT / 13 SME, and save yourself the CM cost. you have a single full base and lesser logistic requirements in the short term.
the SMEs will degrade slightly yes, but my 31 day old SME is only losing me 1 BSE, 1BBH, 1BDE, 9MCG if i were to demolish it now.
this gets you higher throughput through SMEs overall for a similar cost (because you're not paying for a second CM)


[25-Jul-24 03:12 AM] finestone#0000
The main reason for not doing that was COGC bonus


[25-Jul-24 03:12 AM] jcheung#0000
alternatively, and more realistically, keep 6 SMEs and use the extra money to stock other materials you need to keep the base running


[25-Jul-24 03:13 AM] jcheung#0000
the COGC bonus is great and all, but two half finished bases and logistics spanning such a long distance will cost you


[25-Jul-24 03:13 AM] finestone#0000
PrUn actually calculates degradation.


[25-Jul-24 03:13 AM] jcheung#0000
planner? yes it does


[25-Jul-24 03:19 AM] jcheung#0000
anyways


[25-Jul-24 03:19 AM] jcheung#0000
just tossing out options


[25-Jul-24 03:20 AM] finestone#0000
hmmmmm if I set everything up on AU-605c what would the plan be afterwards say once i have another mil


[25-Jul-24 03:20 AM] jcheung#0000
also how much do you have now? because being exactly at 750k for upgrades leaves you not a whole lot for consumables


[25-Jul-24 03:20 AM] finestone#0000
these things are estimates and not done instantly


[25-Jul-24 03:21 AM] finestone#0000
i would probably do a half build to start


[25-Jul-24 03:22 AM] jcheung#0000
if you still want WU, then CM on WU and trade out 2-3 SMEs at a time over there, replace SME with EXT


[25-Jul-24 03:22 AM] jcheung#0000
honestly


[25-Jul-24 03:22 AM] jcheung#0000
you would likely make more profit just outright selling TIO to CX directly than refining it


[25-Jul-24 03:23 AM] finestone#0000
Possibly in the short term yes but also preference


[25-Jul-24 03:23 AM] jcheung#0000
fair


[25-Jul-24 03:24 AM] finestone#0000
I thought WU would help logistics


[25-Jul-24 03:24 AM] finestone#0000
as being a good middle point between ore and CX while also boosting Metallurgy.


[25-Jul-24 03:25 AM] finestone#0000
and triple green for cheaper building


[25-Jul-24 03:25 AM] jcheung#0000
mmm


[25-Jul-24 03:25 AM] finestone#0000
but i understand how as i grow that may become more of a challange but doesnt logstics always become an issue as you grow?


[25-Jul-24 03:25 AM] jcheung#0000
it *is* in the middle isn't it... hmm


[25-Jul-24 03:26 AM] finestone#0000
yeah essetnially my plan was 1 ship ferries ore


[25-Jul-24 03:26 AM] finestone#0000
AU > WU


[25-Jul-24 03:26 AM] finestone#0000
one ship sells TI and brings back supplies


[25-Jul-24 03:26 AM] finestone#0000
WU > A1


[25-Jul-24 03:27 AM] evany.#0000
the game starts you off with two ships


[25-Jul-24 03:27 AM] evany.#0000
but it will be probably many months before you see a third


[25-Jul-24 03:27 AM] finestone#0000
true but i wont need a third for a while and can save up multiples millions by that point


[25-Jul-24 03:27 AM] evany.#0000
consider a ship being 100% used so early on to be a big problem


[25-Jul-24 03:27 AM] finestone#0000
and upgrading the begginer ship will be easier for moving ore anyways


[25-Jul-24 03:28 AM] jcheung#0000
this is an expensive proposition


[25-Jul-24 03:28 AM] evany.#0000
you do start with a generous amount of ship / logistical capability when you start


[25-Jul-24 03:29 AM] jcheung#0000
that upgrade package is like... what was it, 800k to a mil with it subsidized?


[25-Jul-24 03:29 AM] evany.#0000
consider that it's 1.6mil to upgrade the ship + maintenance


[25-Jul-24 03:29 AM] finestone#0000
50k profit daily after fuel and supplies would take 2 months


[25-Jul-24 03:29 AM] evany.#0000
yeah the one package is sold at ~850k, but it doesn't have all the plates and  components that are necessary


[25-Jul-24 03:29 AM] finestone#0000
and thats 3 million


[25-Jul-24 03:31 AM] jcheung#0000
uhm... these two designs combined don't do 50k/d


[25-Jul-24 03:31 AM] jcheung#0000
granted you have room to grow


[25-Jul-24 03:33 AM] finestone#0000
assuming being able to sell TI at 2100 how is that not approaching 50k/d?


[25-Jul-24 03:34 AM] jcheung#0000
hah... i forgot i look at worst case 😂


[25-Jul-24 03:35 AM] finestone#0000
I use 30d moving avg


[25-Jul-24 03:35 AM] finestone#0000
which is the mid spread which is what i post at


[25-Jul-24 03:35 AM] jcheung#0000
market average is resting closer to 2.2k? at least assuming i'm reading the blue line right


[25-Jul-24 03:36 AM] evany.#0000
i wouldn't worry about the blue line so much, statistically its accurate but note the buy on the 17th at a whoppin 1300/unit and the sell at 1600 on the 22nd


[25-Jul-24 03:37 AM] jcheung#0000
fair point


[25-Jul-24 03:37 AM] finestone#0000
so 6 SME is 22 TI per day even selling to asks is still profit


[25-Jul-24 03:38 AM] evany.#0000
and that sell at 1600 was big volume.. 3rd biggest day in the last month.


[25-Jul-24 03:39 AM] evany.#0000
honestly the profit per unit is fine it seems! my concern for you would be more turn around time

i'd urge you to consider a lot of the tim ein the first month you end up selling to buy orders because you need the money _now_ to go buy supplies to keep the base running


[25-Jul-24 03:40 AM] evany.#0000
after you have 5-10 days of supplies now you can kinda wait out buying your next batch of supplies


[25-Jul-24 03:40 AM] evany.#0000
i had to, anyway.. for about 3 weeks before i could coast


[25-Jul-24 03:40 AM] finestone#0000
okay thats fine?


[25-Jul-24 03:41 AM] finestone#0000
i mean next day sold at 2600


[25-Jul-24 03:41 AM] finestone#0000
x681


[25-Jul-24 03:41 AM] evany.#0000
yep


[25-Jul-24 03:41 AM] finestone#0000
even at 1600 im making 30k daily


[25-Jul-24 03:41 AM] evany.#0000
like i said profit per unit not really a concern seems stable-ish


[25-Jul-24 03:42 AM] finestone#0000
yeah product is good


[25-Jul-24 03:42 AM] evany.#0000
i'd say go for it, you've already done a ton of work trying to finesse a plan!


[25-Jul-24 03:42 AM] finestone#0000
Thanks evayoo


[25-Jul-24 03:42 AM] finestone#0000
Thanks JCheung as well


[25-Jul-24 03:43 AM] finestone#0000
Discussion always good and being able to point out positives means i have a good understanding of the plan.


[25-Jul-24 03:43 AM] evany.#0000
i didn't read super above


[25-Jul-24 03:44 AM] finestone#0000
I will say the most interesting prospect is setting up the entire base on AU605C


[25-Jul-24 03:44 AM] evany.#0000
but now that i'm looking at your prunplanner's i think the challenge for you will be realizing some of the profits


[25-Jul-24 03:44 AM] jcheung#0000
if it makes you feel any better i went through like 12 plans in my first week, each one involving a few hours of work


[25-Jul-24 03:44 AM] finestone#0000
and ditching the WU base for awhile


[25-Jul-24 03:45 AM] finestone#0000
i will say i am not counting on any profit from the TAI


[25-Jul-24 03:45 AM] jcheung#0000
gets you started quicker with lower upfront cost-saving on the CM gets you a few more SMEs which offsets the lack of COGC


[25-Jul-24 03:45 AM] finestone#0000
yepp and just way easier to execute


[25-Jul-24 03:46 AM] evany.#0000
are you certain on those locations ?


[25-Jul-24 03:46 AM] jcheung#0000
and more leeway for consumables as well since you're only buffering for one base instead of two


[25-Jul-24 03:47 AM] evany.#0000
AU-605c from ANT is 4-5day round trip 
WU-070a from ANT is probably 3 days


[25-Jul-24 03:47 AM] finestone#0000
SE-648c&a had been discussed as well


[25-Jul-24 03:48 AM] evany.#0000
being in starter ships at 500t limits, means your taking 3 days to haul 2.5'ish days worth of supplies


[25-Jul-24 03:48 AM] evany.#0000
so youll be relying on both ships or third party hauling to make it happen


[25-Jul-24 03:48 AM] evany.#0000
se is probably a much safer bet.


[25-Jul-24 03:49 AM] finestone#0000
w/ inventory maxed out and min fuel     WU-070 a    1 day 8h    
77,813,679 km
36 parsecs
0.274%    
68 units STL fuel
76 units FTL fuel


[25-Jul-24 03:50 AM] finestone#0000
so ANT > WU 1 day 8 hours


[25-Jul-24 03:50 AM] finestone#0000
ANT > AU 2 days


[25-Jul-24 03:50 AM] finestone#0000
AU > ANT


[25-Jul-24 03:50 AM] finestone#0000
AU-605 c    2 days 12h    
76,732,342 km
84 parsecs
0.287%    
61 units STL fuel
178 units FTL fuel


[25-Jul-24 03:51 AM] finestone#0000
ohh you were saying round trip yes your time estimates are correct


[25-Jul-24 03:51 AM] finestone#0000
so i calculated about 5k in fuel daily


[25-Jul-24 03:51 AM] evany.#0000
i struggle sometimes to keep my bases supplied circled:
two day round trip
and i have upgraded/fast ships...

[25-Jul-24 03:52 AM] evany.#0000
being out there every week is bit of a drain ! i would struggle to keep a base afloat that far!!


[25-Jul-24 03:52 AM] finestone#0000
a full load of supplies seems like way more than 3 days


[25-Jul-24 03:52 AM] evany.#0000
yeah my numbers included lhp bonus and 10% speed etc


[25-Jul-24 03:53 AM] evany.#0000
this is your au base its sa ying you import 3m3/4tonnes a day and export 106m3/170tonnes a day

[25-Jul-24 03:54 AM] finestone#0000
yes that is correct


[25-Jul-24 03:55 AM] jcheung#0000
plus side is that with SMEs on that base the exports will go down slightly


[25-Jul-24 03:55 AM] evany.#0000
yeah the real numbers who knows.


[25-Jul-24 03:55 AM] jcheung#0000
*if* they go that route, that is


[25-Jul-24 03:56 AM] evany.#0000
hopefully they are more detail oriented than i am


[25-Jul-24 03:56 AM] evany.#0000
seems like whenever i'm doing a 2day haul out somewhere i'm always there missing 1 Truss


[25-Jul-24 03:57 AM] evany.#0000
4day mistake missing something stupid or forgetting to ship overalls or something


[25-Jul-24 03:58 AM] finestone#0000
true mistakes would be expensive out there


[25-Jul-24 03:58 AM] jcheung#0000
bah, forgetting OVE isn't too bad

....my mistakes i regret are taking ALO the wrong way, from deimos to ANT


[25-Jul-24 03:58 AM] jcheung#0000
and that's just a hop skip and a jump away


[25-Jul-24 03:58 AM] finestone#0000
i may also just build warehouse on each and oversupply 🙂 and help local market the others living around


[25-Jul-24 03:59 AM] evany.#0000
last time ishipped out to somewhere i was missing my 6 truss couldn't deploy the core module had to sit in orbit for three days waiting for my other ship to fix my fuck up lol


[25-Jul-24 03:59 AM] finestone#0000
less to worry about if you have 2 weeks worth of supplies


[25-Jul-24 03:59 AM] jcheung#0000
having at least one STO on your base is a really smart idea


[25-Jul-24 03:59 AM] finestone#0000
i already calc the build out


[25-Jul-24 04:00 AM] finestone#0000
WU-070a (40xBBH 32xBDE 60xBSE 4xBTA 4xLDE 4xLSE 4xLTA 768xMCG 12xPSL 8xTRU)

[25-Jul-24 04:00 AM] jcheung#0000
don't forget initial consumables in that first run


[25-Jul-24 04:02 AM] finestone#0000
yeah i will have to see if they fit on that ship or maybe i do 2 half runs


[25-Jul-24 04:02 AM] finestone#0000
also i should probably build ore world first by itself and get some ore first so the other planet will have something to produce


[25-Jul-24 04:03 AM] jcheung#0000
better to leave off a building or two and take enough consumables to last you until the next trip


[25-Jul-24 04:03 AM] finestone#0000
yepp 100%


[25-Jul-24 04:03 AM] jcheung#0000
also


[25-Jul-24 04:03 AM] jcheung#0000
super important note


[25-Jul-24 04:03 AM] jcheung#0000
when you place a base, you only have 200 guaranteed PIO


[25-Jul-24 04:04 AM] jcheung#0000
there's also 10% of the unemployed available to you, the (x) next to pop requirements when you're building


[25-Jul-24 04:04 AM] jcheung#0000
once that hits 0, you will not gain additional pop until weekly pop reset-but make sure that all your buildings are placed before said reset


[25-Jul-24 04:05 AM] finestone#0000
hmmm interesting


[25-Jul-24 04:05 AM] jcheung#0000
you can figure it out by clicking the population # on PLI


[25-Jul-24 04:05 AM] jcheung#0000
each planet is different


[25-Jul-24 04:06 AM] finestone#0000
WU070 has 4.7k pio with 15% unemplo so good there


[25-Jul-24 04:06 AM] jcheung#0000
which means to start you have 270 PIO to work with


[25-Jul-24 04:06 AM] evany.#0000
really good point something ihadn't considered at all was is the planet functional


[25-Jul-24 04:06 AM] jcheung#0000
yes


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] jcheung#0000
i checked them 😂


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] evany.#0000
good call mr capable


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] finestone#0000
2.1k pio w/ 6% unemplo on AU


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] finestone#0000
so could have issues there


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] evany.#0000
i don't even check my planets!


[25-Jul-24 04:07 AM] evany.#0000
didn't think to check his


[25-Jul-24 04:08 AM] jcheung#0000
oh, actually i might have missed AU


[25-Jul-24 04:08 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, i checked WU and some of the others i brought up but not AU 😬


[25-Jul-24 04:10 AM] jcheung#0000
huh


[25-Jul-24 04:10 AM] finestone#0000
I made sure people were activily living on them


[25-Jul-24 04:10 AM] jcheung#0000
how is the pop stable whatsoever on that planet


[25-Jul-24 04:10 AM] finestone#0000
but AU def small pop


[25-Jul-24 04:10 AM] jcheung#0000
planetary infra isn't at all supplied!


[25-Jul-24 04:11 AM] jcheung#0000
i wonder if there's just like a handful of inactive bases there


[25-Jul-24 04:11 AM] jcheung#0000
and apparently infrastructure still provides a little bit of effect even while completely not upkept?


[25-Jul-24 04:12 AM] evany.#0000
yeah thats the problem with rim planets. you might end up holding the 'bag' so to speak


[25-Jul-24 04:12 AM] evany.#0000
is it still profitable to run the base when your also supplying the planet?


[25-Jul-24 04:12 AM] evany.#0000
maybe. honestly never looked


[25-Jul-24 04:12 AM] jcheung#0000
technically... maybe


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] jcheung#0000
can probably get away with just supplying DW


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] evany.#0000
is that all pops need to not flee and keep happiness high enough ?


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] jcheung#0000
which is... uh. how to read this. 50 a day?


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] evany.#0000
seems like a lot when dw is 100 bucks a unit ?


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] evany.#0000
5k/day


[25-Jul-24 04:13 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, so cuts a fair chunk out of profit margin


[25-Jul-24 04:14 AM] jcheung#0000
would have to get one of the gov experts to say for sure if just DW would be enough here


[25-Jul-24 04:14 AM] finestone#0000
should i reach out to the 2 people activily living there and ask?


[25-Jul-24 04:14 AM] jcheung#0000
in other news, might have chatted enough that you probably want to post your entire plan again for people to see 😂 oops.


[25-Jul-24 04:15 AM] jcheung#0000

so one person out there


[25-Jul-24 04:17 AM] evany.#0000
might be worth trying to reach out to that player and get his take


[25-Jul-24 04:18 AM] finestone#0000
okay


[25-Jul-24 04:18 AM] evany.#0000
see if you can make a friend


[25-Jul-24 04:18 AM] evany.#0000
its what i would do if i were going to rim


[25-Jul-24 04:22 AM] finestone#0000
okay i shot him a message


[25-Jul-24 04:24 AM] evany.#0000
he's in the official discord


[25-Jul-24 04:24 AM] evany.#0000

[25-Jul-24 06:38 AM] jvaler#0000
uh that's not how ROI works, ROI is return on investment not just time until first revenue. pretty sure you're not making back 750k AIC in 10d lol

but everything else looks pretty good. i'll send u the grant when i'm home


[25-Jul-24 06:39 AM] finestone#0000
50k daily x 14 days is 700k but okay! Thanks


[25-Jul-24 06:40 AM] jvaler#0000
50k daily from that few buildings? huh... alright


[25-Jul-24 06:41 AM] finestone#0000
It may be unrealistic! We shall see 😄 regardless should be profitable!


[25-Jul-24 06:42 AM] finestone#0000
27 ti daily x2100 avg is 50k alone plus additional ore sales to cover expenses and fuel.


[25-Jul-24 06:47 AM] finestone#0000
Also am I able to join the corp? If I need to be more established thats fine too are thier requirements? Thanks again for this awesome grant! I hope to make ANT proud!


[25-Jul-24 07:21 AM] jvaler#0000
the corp is mainly for aesthetic purposes under the CULT label(production co-ops), which AGP doesn't actually fall under. our corp HQ is on elon so if you had a base there i'd be happy to make an exception for the +10% boost. but as it is there's not much purpose


[25-Jul-24 07:25 AM] finestone#0000
Understood 😊 thanks


[25-Jul-24 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looks like a pretty good plan! If you want your money sooner or jvaler gets busy, let me know, and I can send it too


[25-Jul-24 03:09 PM] jvaler#0000
oops yeah i should put it in the log


[25-Jul-24 08:01 PM] xtc69#0000

aww ty still stilling up base before i spend a dime lol


[25-Jul-24 10:08 PM] xtc69#0000
going to make sure you guys help me fully lol


[25-Jul-24 10:08 PM] archielvahr#0000

don't forget to use the internal market!


[26-Jul-24 01:54 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Hello, this is my reapplication for the grant.

I want to liquidate my company and restart on Deimos to eventually export aluminum to do lightweight bulkhead construction on Nike to take advantage of the COGC.

Deimos base (475k):
5x HB1
3x Extractor for ALO
5x SME producing AL

Nike (205k):
1x HB1
1x HB2
4x PP2 for LBH

Theoretical ROI: ~10 days (excluding shipping time/costs/bottlenecks)

Let me know if this sounds reasonable.


[26-Jul-24 02:03 PM] finestone#0000
If you did this in PrunPlanner want to link? top right is share thanks

[26-Jul-24 02:05 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I'm not sure how to share the overall plan, so these are the two separate bases


[26-Jul-24 02:09 PM] finestone#0000
Seems good only thing i can tell is buying the ALO (in current market conditions) seems more profitable use of capitol then mining maybe start off with only 1 EXT?


[26-Jul-24 02:12 PM] finestone#0000
Actually never mind ROI is way better on those then i initially saw i would leave it as is! I am noob tho so get other opinion 🙂


[26-Jul-24 02:13 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh lmao ok


[26-Jul-24 02:15 PM] jcheung#0000
you may want to consider adding some STO as well


[26-Jul-24 02:16 PM] igfloz#0000
If you "can" have a planet for each, taking advantage of both CoGC, you may find that you have excess ALO - This can be sold on the LM or CX for further profit 🙂


[26-Jul-24 02:16 PM] igfloz#0000
ooh, yeah STO is an awesome idea


[26-Jul-24 02:16 PM] jcheung#0000
i also suggest you reduce PP2 count by one and increase SME count by one


[26-Jul-24 02:16 PM] jcheung#0000
the reason behind that being that, then you would make an excess of AL instead of needing it


[26-Jul-24 02:17 PM] jcheung#0000
additionally, this reduces your startup costs slightly which gives you more overhead for feedstock


[26-Jul-24 02:17 PM] finestone#0000
there may be benefit to also producing LDE in addition to LBH as you will have less impact on market 🙂


[26-Jul-24 02:18 PM] jcheung#0000
what do you mean by 'less'


[26-Jul-24 02:18 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
What is STO?


[26-Jul-24 02:18 PM] igfloz#0000
storage


[26-Jul-24 02:19 PM] finestone#0000
over saturation can lead to decreased margins was all i was thinking

[26-Jul-24 02:20 PM] finestone#0000
LBH LDE and LTA all use AL and have similar ROI so rotating through them should allow for better margins was my thinking


[26-Jul-24 02:21 PM] jcheung#0000
LDE will cost a lot to get that NL


[26-Jul-24 02:21 PM] jcheung#0000
it's not a good choice to start


[26-Jul-24 02:22 PM] jcheung#0000
also PP2 is just a building, they can flex into whatever recipe later with ease


[26-Jul-24 02:22 PM] igfloz#0000
I think that is why we see periods of low LDE availability sometimes


[26-Jul-24 02:23 PM] jcheung#0000
so maybe first week LTA, LBH... next week LDE, maybe toss in some B-fabs


[26-Jul-24 02:23 PM] jcheung#0000
the only thing you should try to avoid making with a PP2 is BDE


[26-Jul-24 02:23 PM] finestone#0000
true but the margins on final product are worth it


[26-Jul-24 02:24 PM] jcheung#0000
it's not worth it if you tie up all your remaining funds for a day and a half of production, then you have to wait half a day to buy more feedstock and then another half a day to ship feed back


[26-Jul-24 03:59 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I don't think I'd be impacting margins at the volumes I'm producing


[26-Jul-24 04:04 PM] jcheung#0000
not likely, no.


[26-Jul-24 04:05 PM] jcheung#0000
i don't know if you got around to seeing this line nano?


[26-Jul-24 06:07 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh yeah, I probably will do that


[26-Jul-24 11:05 PM] jvaler#0000
this sounds great! gonna go send you a cont for the grant now


[26-Jul-24 11:44 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Thank you!


[26-Jul-24 11:46 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh wait, I'm dumb, I terminated the contract before taking the money, could you send it again? @jvaler


[26-Jul-24 11:46 PM] jvaler#0000
no, thank you for developing antares 🫡


[26-Jul-24 11:46 PM] jvaler#0000

[26-Jul-24 11:46 PM] jvaler#0000
you did it right


[26-Jul-24 11:46 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh, there was a delay on my finance screen for some reason


[26-Jul-24 11:47 PM] shinonomesciences#0000

Ah, that's what I was confused about


[27-Jul-24 12:00 AM] jvaler#0000
@shinonomesciences remember to rent warehouses on ANT too


[27-Jul-24 12:12 AM] jcheung#0000
i think you can technically plug in ZV-307 and leave off the letter at the end too


[27-Jul-24 12:13 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah that's it's technical location i think, ANT just being shorthand


[27-Jul-24 12:13 AM] jvaler#0000
or maybe it's the other way around?

It's a pg base a cult project


[06-Aug-24 10:43 AM] jvaler#0000
you're already getting a 2.1mil 0% interest loan for that, right? the 750k grant would be going to something else then... do you have a plan for your 3rd base?


[06-Aug-24 10:44 AM] realmraker#0000
This would be my 3rd base


[06-Aug-24 10:44 AM] jvaler#0000
oh didn't realize you were on helion prime


[06-Aug-24 10:44 AM] realmraker#0000
So have to upgrade the hq


[06-Aug-24 10:44 AM] realmraker#0000
Would like to expand to more Chem bases


[06-Aug-24 10:45 AM] jvaler#0000
even more than the planned elon base?


[06-Aug-24 10:45 AM] realmraker#0000
Yep


[06-Aug-24 10:46 AM] realmraker#0000
Probably producing ddt or something


[06-Aug-24 10:46 AM] jvaler#0000
well your next options in antares would be griffonstone, electronica, or... bober...


[06-Aug-24 10:47 AM] realmraker#0000
I'll come back here when I have a plan

I am NOT looking for a grant (yet) I just would like someone to review this plan and tell me their thoughts. Only just made a company after liquidating, this plan looks to fill a market gap more than make fast ROI (designed a different one that is vastly faster ROI but the supply already is crazy compared to the demand (so likely would price crash it) where as BSE has a lot of demand but not as much supply it seems)

[06-Aug-24 11:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So since Deimos’ CoGC is metallurgy that will get a boost


[06-Aug-24 11:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So generally it’s better to follow that since that means you can produce more stuff per day


[06-Aug-24 11:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You could leave the ext and col maybe


[06-Aug-24 11:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But I would definitely take off the FRM INC PP2 etc


[06-Aug-24 11:43 AM] jcheung#0000
🤔 why only half settler luxury?

{Reactions}
👆 

[06-Aug-24 11:44 AM] kumotomeko#0000
was just a balance issue since ROI went down with it as the amount of stuff started to get messy, as for the other part, I was aiming to produce as much as I could without drawing from market as much


[06-Aug-24 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
ROI decreasing is a good thing


[06-Aug-24 11:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It is ok to use the CX Bc it does cost you to make stuff


[06-Aug-24 11:45 AM] kumotomeko#0000
I meant the money it made was less


[06-Aug-24 11:46 AM] jcheung#0000
i personally would consider splitting off your PP2s to another planet and slotting in more SMEs

{Reactions}
👆 (2) 

[06-Aug-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
frm and inc probably should go to yet another... but that probably costs too much right now


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
and the rig, i think may cost you more per unit of water than it could hope to save you


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] kumotomeko#0000
so basically just completely depend on the market for a lot of resources instead of produce them myself and hyper specialise planets?


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
well there's the thing


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
you want to hyper specialize planets because of COGC boosts-they reduce your workforce cost per unit produced


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
it's a big boost


[06-Aug-24 11:48 AM] .urpalhal#0000
As a beginner I’d say yeah bc you’ll make more money that way since you’ll make more per day


[06-Aug-24 11:49 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s a HUGE boost


[06-Aug-24 11:49 AM] kumotomeko#0000
well the highest ROI also provided an insane amount of resources where supply is already vastly higher than demand


[06-Aug-24 11:49 AM] kumotomeko#0000
so felt like producing something useful might be better


[06-Aug-24 11:50 AM] .urpalhal#0000
There are some projects that you could get into that produce BSE and BBH if you wanted to go that route


[06-Aug-24 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
with the PP2s specifically though, if you're making BSE, a single SME can support 2 PP2's... so it's reasonable to assume that you could fill out an entire base with PP2's with the output of SMEs you could put in the place of those PP2's you have now


[06-Aug-24 11:50 AM] kumotomeko#0000
was just an idea following the resource map for what I could produce


[06-Aug-24 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
though transport may be an issue


[06-Aug-24 11:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
If you do want to do some smaller scale niche products


[06-Aug-24 11:52 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You could do LHP


[06-Aug-24 11:52 AM] .urpalhal#0000
WEL are metallurgy and they use AL


[06-Aug-24 11:52 AM] jcheung#0000
is WEL metallurgy?


[06-Aug-24 11:52 AM] jcheung#0000
thoguht it was construction


[06-Aug-24 11:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it’s metallurgy

also how does the corporation hq on planet work? is that my starting planet or actually joining a company or whatever?


[06-Aug-24 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
you have to join a corperation and then have a HQ built


[06-Aug-24 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
it's not the same as your company HQ

@kumotomeko Here's a limited selection of beginner materials and rough estimation of money/day of a dedicated base at 100%. There are more profitable options and some mats are best produced together with others as to not overwhelm the demand but I hope this might help a bit

Would it be acceptable to apply for the grant to produce fuel (and related outputs) out of IY-206? thinking about expanding to a few planets in that system


[14-Aug-24 06:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmmm...

1) Which process(es)? SF/FF
2) Which planet(s)? IY-206a-j
3) How much of an FTL capability, in terms of t/m3, are you willing to supply that project, once per week (at least)?
4) What are the projected base metrics, that you have in mind?

This ain't banter/counterpoint either. Just pure info. Maybe you might find a better site of fuel production, should you consider these things. However, grants usually are dolled, irl, regarding the viability of what's proposed. 

If your idea can be / is viable, then let us know how we can help you. 🙂


[14-Aug-24 06:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd think you're aiming for this (with max experts). Who knows, right?

A VCB import of H, and a WCB export of FF, every ~10 days, not counting the repair mats.

Hmm, this could be better in the long term, but there's no COGC at IY-206j. :/

[14-Aug-24 06:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Either option is #fully-viable, provided that you can get the logistics covered. It a little (quite a large issue actually), when people go head-first into fuel production. They like the margins, but they forget about the t/m3 requirements, should you want to run such a process. 

Iirc, this sort of thing popped up like a year, or two ago. UV-351a was a big fuel refining hub.... until people found out what their logistical needs were, and what better margins they could get from manufacturing.... That planet largely stopped being a fuel refining hub, long ago.


[14-Aug-24 06:43 AM] revoric#0000
i was thinking about going full col on IY-206i didnt go much further yet not sure what direction to go . i normally play space games by launching myself out and play self sufficiently but this game doent take kindly to that notion without a cordinated group of people lol


[14-Aug-24 06:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So a full IY-206i | COL (HE3 export to ANT)?


[14-Aug-24 06:45 AM] revoric#0000
currently that was the plan, locating a refinery location would be next, though with just my 2 starter ships im not sure what the logistical demands are


[14-Aug-24 06:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The top right, of my screenies, with the white screens, are daily t/m3 requirements for Import/Export.


[14-Aug-24 06:47 AM] revoric#0000
so not terrible for he3 production, deffinatly a drain for ff i see


[14-Aug-24 06:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So, you're looking at ~50t/350m3 in export requirements, from your original idea, or something like it.


[14-Aug-24 06:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But the base idea is very, very viable.


[14-Aug-24 06:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Your main issue --- funding a VCB FTL to make your life simple, in this game.


[14-Aug-24 06:49 AM] revoric#0000
what is you opinion on 206 c for beryl crystals? , i have yet to look at ship building looks expensive for my 76k account lol


[14-Aug-24 06:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
LOL... beryl, lets see....


[14-Aug-24 06:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's incredibly niche... The output is used for S/M/LFE emitters, and FTL engines.... Not the best idea if you're just starting out, since people like to vertically integrate their operations, when they're at the late-game stage, and whatever figures you see for the BER, are likely a surplus market (no guaranteed weekly sales).


[14-Aug-24 07:00 AM] revoric#0000
i understand that lol so many things to do


[14-Aug-24 07:06 AM] tanda#0000
Regarding fuel production, there was a group of individuals attempting to step up a system for fuel production at QJ-382, have you looked into that system at all?


[14-Aug-24 07:07 AM] revoric#0000
i have not lookin now 🙂


[14-Aug-24 07:07 AM] tanda#0000
oh it was Katinga with OOG that was leading that one


[14-Aug-24 07:08 AM] revoric#0000
where do they get their he3?


[14-Aug-24 07:09 AM] revoric#0000
or do they only produce sf?


[14-Aug-24 07:10 AM] tanda#0000
I would assume if they're doing FF in the system that the HE3 is just being exported from IY-206j. That's the only planet with significant amounts of HE3 in ANT space with any population


[14-Aug-24 07:11 AM] revoric#0000
i assumed that would be the case


[14-Aug-24 07:18 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Welcome @revoric ! Keep up the research and planning, there's a lot of options but fuel seems like a great plan. I just sent a contract for the grant if you're ready for it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Lol


[14-Aug-24 07:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I mean, I don't have anything against any of those people, but then you're sinking that much, into a single relationship, expecting returns, you're just asking for serious trouble. Life happens, and this should be kept in mind, since there's no built-in insurance, sort of thing, in-game, to "underwrite" these sorts of possibilities.

I'm not sure, the game doesn't offer a lot of reasons to travel that far yet 😅 and no, but supporters can name systems


[14-Aug-24 07:51 AM] revoric#0000
i still yearn to get 5-10-20 people together and try to "settle" an area lol i totally missed out on the early days

[14-Aug-24 07:51 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah the internal offers are meant to help people and are basically always a much better deal. Usually just ping them and make sure they have supply

[14-Aug-24 07:52 AM] revoric#0000
its not "hard" to support basic infistructre with a few people as long as i continue to not look at planetary upkeet XD


[14-Aug-24 07:55 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
😅 yeah I've seen some really rich players do things like that. It takes a lot to set up

Yeah I'm dolling out some serious counterpoint on UFO, regarding all of that..... Fawk, 138m? Geez, I'm not even done with reading yesterday's backlog, of the issue, on UFO.

[20-Aug-24 03:47 AM] laaxus#0000
I think it is


[20-Aug-24 03:48 AM] laaxus#0000
my plan is to produce PE, a LOT of PE


[20-Aug-24 03:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Because C and H supply is high


[20-Aug-24 03:50 AM] laaxus#0000
Because PE demand >> supply and trade volume is high, meaning that I'll always be able to sell my production

I might change planet so wait a bit before acception


[20-Aug-24 04:37 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but PE ASK.CX sales are usually slow. I think you'll be making more than the daily traded amount, so you may have to dump to BID.CX, unless you can find buyers. Of course, PE is usually needed in huge chunks for COG upkeeps, and it could be an option for you, if your sales slow down. 

You still have free base area in that base plan, so it's doable.


[20-Aug-24 04:40 AM] laaxus#0000
From what I saw, PE is one of the product with the most demand


[20-Aug-24 04:41 AM] laaxus#0000
so I don't get it, if production means I'll easily supply more than the traded volume, how does one make profit


[20-Aug-24 04:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I said it's slow. 1 person can buy out like 100k+ units of PE, and will not need to buy it for another 1-2 months, if they really use that commodity.


[20-Aug-24 04:42 AM] razenpok#0000
You should diversify your BMP production orders so you produce more types of stuff to not oversaturate the market


[20-Aug-24 04:42 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's other scenarios in that, but I never seen PE sales go quick, from ASK.CX bids.


[20-Aug-24 04:43 AM] razenpok#0000
15 BMPs would murder any commodity market if focused on a single product

[20-Aug-24 04:45 AM] laaxus#0000
does players try to bypass the market as much as they can, producing the whole chain themselves ?


[20-Aug-24 04:45 AM] razenpok#0000
Some of them do, but not all of them


[20-Aug-24 04:45 AM] finestone#0000
yes but the big thing is they trade directly with eachother more than using CX


[20-Aug-24 04:46 AM] laaxus#0000
oh ok, players are trading between themselves


[20-Aug-24 04:46 AM] razenpok#0000
I don't think it's that prevalent

Sim companies (similar game) releases how much is traded on CX compared to private orders


[20-Aug-24 04:47 AM] razenpok#0000
@laaxus how much these 15 BMPs would produce PE a day?


[20-Aug-24 04:47 AM] laaxus#0000
10k


[20-Aug-24 04:47 AM] razenpok#0000
No, they only release CX numbers


[20-Aug-24 04:48 AM] finestone#0000
until they release i dont think we will know i should not have said "more"

are the only thing player constant buy from the market  fuel rations and construction materials ?


[20-Aug-24 04:52 AM] finestone#0000
You could starting out but its not ideal. The main reason is you are just trading carbon import for the thing you are turning into carbon

💯 (2) 

[20-Aug-24 04:52 AM] razenpok#0000
Mostly, yes, and some basic materials like AL C PE PG


[20-Aug-24 04:53 AM] razenpok#0000
I'm running 12 BMPs and recently I've been switching recipes a lot due to market price changes


[20-Aug-24 04:53 AM] razenpok#0000
OFF price is dropping for example, so I stopped producing it


[20-Aug-24 04:54 AM] finestone#0000
I rotate my BMP's from MG, PE, OVE, EXO, SEA.


[20-Aug-24 04:55 AM] laaxus#0000
so how about this.
I coliq, restart on hephaistos 
Take the grant, build a total of 10 bmp, producing PE for the current time, keeping the rest of the money for the time I want to do something else ?


[20-Aug-24 04:56 AM] finestone#0000
that sounds like a good starting point to me but i am not a grant giver 🙂

you have to have pro to recieve a grant

you can start wherever you like, the planet you pick just determines where your ship loaded with materials spawns at

so you can spawn in and just fly over to heph and plop the base down

i like the plan though, BMPs are good money and you can't go wrong with PE. just tell me once you've got PRO and i'll send the grant cont

Do take the grant, thatll move you forward 1-2 months


[20-Aug-24 10:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Pure liquidity injections, just boost player growth. The key phase is from B-fab HQ upgrades, through L-fab HQ upgrades. You get to plop down a central core of what your want your business to look like, and then you grow out from there.

[20-Aug-24 10:30 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The issue lies in being uncertain, and not pulling the trigger on production, actionable now.


[20-Aug-24 10:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
With some discount building materials and a grant you can completely fill your first base on Heph.


[20-Aug-24 10:30 AM] marat_sh#0000
You can also mix some basic/luxury in addition to PE production like REP and EXO


[20-Aug-24 10:31 AM] marat_sh#0000
MCG is also nice to produce in small quantities (own use and sell)


[20-Aug-24 10:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[20-Aug-24 10:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Huge influx of RAT purchases, across all CXs, about 2-3 weeks ago, which broke the previous demand/supply spreads.

@archielvahr, @cptcoleslaw & @sidepipe 

what do you think about raising AGP to 1mil each? the 750k figure was made up because of the expectation that it would be split 3 ways as 250k each, but given modern circumstances this doesn't really apply anymore.

i think the extra 250k would make a big difference in being able to fill out a base, as getting sufficient material+consumable buffers seems to eat up a significant portion of the current 750k.

😆 hell yeah, I *knew* that's how votes worked


[25-Aug-24 04:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think I have a strong opinion. When I was first giving out grant money ( a few years ago ), I did 250k, cause that was about right to finish out most of the rest of your starter base, get people's farm base to 500 area, etc. My thought was that would break them out of the doldrums of sending nearly empty ships to make 15k selling 100 BEA at a time or whatever. now the price situation has changed a fair bit, and most of the starter bases fill out around 800k ( at CX prices for bfabs ). That doesn't count consumables, so I'm sure that pushes it towards 1m. I think they start with ~160k of stuff, right?


[25-Aug-24 04:11 PM] jvaler#0000
not sure... but bases are definitely pushing the 1mil+ cost range. FRMs are the only thing i can think of that are ~800k

Anyway, not opposed to changing it. Ideally we ahve some sort of idea of "what amount of money hooks them on the game". Somewhere there's a "too much" but I have no idea where that's at.

i must have been thinking of deimos 20 SME. weird


[25-Aug-24 04:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
For my part, I'm also under 'no strong opinions'. I think more money is more betterer. I think some funding would be better used on other forms of support (like ADI ship kits), but the jump from 750k to 1M doesn't make a huge difference in terms of what money is going where


[25-Aug-24 04:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I feel like having a 2nd planet really opens up the game, so filling their first base and letting their next couple steps on their own be starting the second base is fun for them.

[25-Aug-24 04:17 PM] jvaler#0000
yup, but from what i've seen the 750k just doesn't go far enough to effectively open that up as an option


[25-Aug-24 04:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
there is a point where if you give too much cash upfront you have a pile of money that you don't know what to do with - not saying 1M is that point necessarily 😄


[25-Aug-24 04:17 PM] jvaler#0000
1mil would leave players much more comfortable


[25-Aug-24 04:18 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why showing a plan is a prerequisite to the grant :P

2 other thoughts: 

1) We'd get a lot more takers if we advertised in the in-game local chats. It also get people to join discord, which some casual joiners don't even know exist. And if they join discord they stick around in ANT longer.

2) I can also just send you cash to distribute because I don't always see grant requests. I did that for Australis and it worked well


[25-Aug-24 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
at the end of the day, if you think it's the right way forward, I'm not opposed. I haven't even paid a grant in a while 😄


[25-Aug-24 04:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could do the same


[25-Aug-24 04:22 PM] jvaler#0000
i've got plenty of money myself to hand out grants, so our "first come first serve" system is working out fine for now. but if i run low i'll give you a message

...maybe time to start an ADI low interest loan program? 😄


[25-Aug-24 04:24 PM] jvaler#0000
i just might, i get plenty of DMs :P

[25-Aug-24 04:25 PM] jvaler#0000
okay speaking of harmonia i gotta think of what to write in an AGP ad...


[25-Aug-24 04:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
i wouldn't be opposed to doing some low-interest loans, as long as they're fairly small


[25-Aug-24 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I don't have nearly as deep pockets as some of the players doing loans regularly, which is why I haven't offered them publicly


[25-Aug-24 04:27 PM] jcheung#0000
as a side note, i notice most people do interest and stable... but what about annuity?


[25-Aug-24 04:28 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah, what about annuity?


[25-Aug-24 04:28 PM] jvaler#0000
(what's annuity)


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
fixed payments


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
also less interest paid in the same time period


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
12 easy payments of 9.99 a month?


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
basically


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it's just not as popular because your individual payments are much larger


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jvaler#0000
ah don't you have one of those with me?


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
another benefit is there's no "hill". with stable, the first payment hits like a truck


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
and the interest difference is very small if your payments are not frequent


[25-Aug-24 04:29 PM] jcheung#0000
with interest the last payment hits like a ship


[25-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jcheung#0000
technically i suppose


[25-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jvaler#0000
replied to the wrong thing, meant to reply to the "fixed payments"


[25-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jvaler#0000
cause it's 0 interest lol


[25-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, technically 😛


[25-Aug-24 04:31 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways, this technically isn't true


[25-Aug-24 04:31 PM] jcheung#0000
it levelizes the payments so that compared to stable, the end you pay more per payment but at the start you pay less per payment


[25-Aug-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000
which means that you have less stress up front


[25-Aug-24 04:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh annuity is the growing payment?


[25-Aug-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000
you also pay down your principle faster


[25-Aug-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000
here, actually let me get some examples set up


[25-Aug-24 04:33 PM] jcheung#0000
note that annuity interest amount will change a good bit depending on the % paid


[25-Aug-24 04:39 PM] jcheung#0000
these are all 5m at 2% interest with 10 payments. interval isn't a factor.

[25-Aug-24 04:40 PM] jcheung#0000
errr. wait. oops. far right isn't 10 payments 🤔 why isn't it....


[25-Aug-24 04:41 PM] jcheung#0000
bleh. i guess 10 payments doesn't have as much a range to let me skew things around like 14% did


[25-Aug-24 04:41 PM] jcheung#0000
ignore the rightmost one then


[25-Aug-24 04:43 PM] jcheung#0000
hmmm. maybe i picked bad numbers for this, let me try with a longer duration. i know i got an annuity loan from someone for lower payments to start than stable


[25-Aug-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
aha. yes


[25-Aug-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
more payment terms is how i did it


[25-Aug-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
let me...


[25-Aug-24 04:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah I feel like the loan contract template names are dumb because they refer to the repayment of the principal, not of the loan itself (or rather, the payment you end up making)


[25-Aug-24 04:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
Hence my confusion on which one is which 😄


[25-Aug-24 04:51 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so i didn't end up with lower interest than stable in this one but that's fine. think maybe because my loan i was looking at this for was a much larger amount. lower initial payment though, can be achieved

[25-Aug-24 04:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
So, all else (interest, number of payments, principal amount) being equal, interest > stable > annuity in terms of how much you end up paying in total


[25-Aug-24 04:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
The advantage of an interest loan is that you get to hold onto that principal for longer to do stuff with (so if you’re building a base that costs 5M, you don’t need to borrow like 5.5M upfront to cover that first payment before your base really starts making money)

{Reactions}
💯 

[25-Aug-24 04:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think people also just avoid the annuity loans because they look confusing 😄


[25-Aug-24 04:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
But if you think of like a student loan or car loan in real life, that’s pretty much an annuity loan in Prun terms, if you’re making the suggested payment


[25-Aug-24 05:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, annuity just feels impractical for most loans in Prun unless you're handing out lots of big loans as a banking business or something. That frontloaded interest could help when there's always the chance of some of those borrowers quitting the game. But Interest loans are best here I think. KAWA does a lot of interest loans for new bases, since ROI is usually pretty short, we often set up loans so that *everything* is just due all at once at the end... We also have other loan types we use now for loaning or repaying with materials instead of cash. I really wish the game supported that


[25-Aug-24 05:09 PM] jcheung#0000
easy, set up conts with long durations on them, buy at x price for x good, send 20 conts 😄


[25-Aug-24 05:10 PM] jcheung#0000
but yeah... there's a lot of things i wish could happen


[25-Aug-24 05:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just hope they revamp contracts to act like motions do


[25-Aug-24 05:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
Because then we could do exactly that in one contract

[25-Aug-24 05:39 PM] tanda#0000

[25-Aug-24 05:39 PM] tanda#0000
cuts down on defaults by a lot


[25-Aug-24 05:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
Or loan in two stages


[25-Aug-24 05:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
Lend them 500k


[25-Aug-24 05:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
Let them return it and lend them the rest


[25-Aug-24 05:56 PM] jcheung#0000
....how about ship grants


[25-Aug-24 05:57 PM] jvaler#0000
players that need improved logi don't need grants, they need loans. and i'm already planning to offer loans for the upcoming production project

still haven't given me a name to log :P


[26-Aug-24 05:32 AM] prozer#0000
@hopeisabanana and @caradan_ both 500k for now


[26-Aug-24 05:33 AM] jvaler#0000
gotcha


[26-Aug-24 05:34 AM] jvaler#0000
wait "for now"? do you plan on giving more? cause the sheet can't handle that 😬


[26-Aug-24 05:34 AM] jvaler#0000
only 1 entry per person


[26-Aug-24 05:35 AM] jvaler#0000
so if you plan on more later tell me the final amount


[26-Aug-24 05:36 AM] prozer#0000
Yeah I mean for now, cause apparently this group is 6 ppl, only 2 joinned


[26-Aug-24 05:36 AM] jvaler#0000
okay but are they only getting 500k each? or do you plan on more?


[26-Aug-24 05:41 AM] prozer#0000
500k each


[26-Aug-24 05:41 AM] prozer#0000
Not more


[26-Aug-24 05:42 AM] prozer#0000
I think more is not really a good idea, they will not understand the value of such amount if I would gave more


[26-Aug-24 05:44 AM] prozer#0000
Ok both 500k got sended


[26-Aug-24 05:53 AM] hopeisabanana#0000

the rest of AGP has decided on a higher number, so while i'll count these donations under the AGP umbrella i'd appreciate it if you don't spread any misconceptions about AGP using this lower number


[26-Aug-24 05:56 AM] jvaler#0000
so to be clear if someone comes into the server seeking AGP, or if you advertise in any chats under the AGP name, they get 1mil AIC grants.


[26-Aug-24 06:00 AM] prozer#0000
Oh no that’s ok, if you want me to align on any higher number I can do it no problem


[26-Aug-24 06:01 AM] prozer#0000
I got 750k from agp when I started and that’s why I said that, I felt I got « too much in one go » but if agp agreed on 1mil then next one will be 1mil


[26-Aug-24 12:03 PM] hopeisabanana#0000

Try to avoid high temperature planets


[26-Aug-24 01:17 PM] realmraker#0000
the extra mats make it too expensive right


[26-Aug-24 01:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
different materials will be used


[26-Aug-24 01:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
some are very expancive


[26-Aug-24 01:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
INS is cheaper


[26-Aug-24 01:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
so try to use cold planets instead of hot


[26-Aug-24 01:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
plus there is a lot of people who make INS here so if you gonna buy in bulk you may get it cheaper then ASK price


[26-Aug-24 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
why is bober bad?

i don't know, you can do a lot without ever leaving ANT faction space


[26-Aug-24 02:58 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
At that point it was better to move a ship to Mor and develop a secondary hub there


[26-Aug-24 02:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
People used to have to move, out of ANT, when SEA/INS/HSE were in short supply... Things have changed since then.


[26-Aug-24 02:59 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
You also get the benefit of access to more CXs


[26-Aug-24 03:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Now? You have plot-blocked CX planets. You want to move to MOR? Well you only have INS+HSE (Pallada+) to deal with.. Montem, Iiron, Vallis have all been blocked out, unless you want to COLIQ.


[26-Aug-24 03:01 PM] laaxus#0000
is it really that bad to build on a non 3 green planet ?


[26-Aug-24 03:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
red-2 planets --- not that bad.


[26-Aug-24 03:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
No. But when you want 6-8 chem planet you run out


[26-Aug-24 03:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Also, if you are building up on loans, capital efficiency is really important


[26-Aug-24 03:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
And you get a nice benefit of getting involved in other regions


[26-Aug-24 03:03 PM] laaxus#0000
but for example, there's is this planet at 1 distance from ant cx
Why not just colonise there ?

[26-Aug-24 03:09 PM] jcheung#0000
it could be grown, yes

[26-Aug-24 03:14 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well for that planet, you'd be better off just applying for (this is just CHP bases, or more), base SST buildings, + 1-2 warehouses.


[26-Aug-24 03:14 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
An ADM is like 1+ mil aready, so you'll eatup the grant money, with no tangible benefit.


[26-Aug-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's a high temp planet, so it requires TSH.. and those are pretty expensive that's why no one wants to live there

it's rather cheap though. Maybe prunplanner projetions would make it viable for someone.

Morning all, looking to either relocate to heph or to build out my BMP base further on Phobos. If I don't relocate then my second base will be on heph.

Currently weighing up pros and cons. Id rather keep a good COGI bonus for something more profitable than BMPs but happy for some feedback/thoughts


[28-Aug-24 04:42 PM] laaxus#0000
COGI bonus doesn't matter


[28-Aug-24 04:43 PM] laaxus#0000
Much better long term to start your bmp base on heipha


[28-Aug-24 04:43 PM] laaxus#0000
phobos isn't a good starting base


[28-Aug-24 04:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
Relocate your BMPs from Phobos but Keep CM on phobos


[28-Aug-24 04:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
later you can build Clean rooms

Anyways. Would I get approved for AGP while staying on Phobos building BMPs for the nostalgia and building my second on  heph in about 2 weeks when I've filled Phobos or would I need to make the 'rational' decision and move straight away?


[28-Aug-24 05:10 PM] laaxus#0000
Well you could technically build your bmp on phobos, and salvage them in 90 days instead of repairing them


[28-Aug-24 05:10 PM] laaxus#0000
but that would reduce your profit by 25%


[28-Aug-24 05:10 PM] laaxus#0000
not recommended


[28-Aug-24 05:11 PM] laaxus#0000
Furthermore, after destroying your buildings and building them again on heipha, you'll have to wait another 2 month to get back your 5 experts


[28-Aug-24 05:11 PM] laaxus#0000
even less recommended

[28-Aug-24 05:24 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd definitely prefer you spend the money a bit wiser and dump it into heph > phobos, but BMPs are profitable enough on their own that i'm honestly okay with it

Hello I am planning out a small BER -> BE setup. I see that we mainly use SE-648b as the extractor location. Where is the best place to put the AML ? I already have a base on Deimos with an SME


[16-Sep-24 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000
do you know about prunplanner ?


[16-Sep-24 06:27 AM] martinswdev#0000
Yes planning it out on that at the moment


[16-Sep-24 06:28 AM] laaxus#0000
you should show a screen of your base when you're done planning


[16-Sep-24 06:28 AM] laaxus#0000
here's a list of things you should pay attention to :


[16-Sep-24 06:28 AM] laaxus#0000
1) How much does the base itself cost
2) How much does 3 days of input goods as buffer cost
3) How hard is shipping the input goods
4) How hard is shipping the ouput goods
5) Is there enough supply for the input goods
6) Is there enough demand for the output goods


[16-Sep-24 06:29 AM] laaxus#0000
And most importantly :
7) What is the expected ROI ?


[16-Sep-24 06:32 AM] martinswdev#0000
Ok thanks will keep that in mind

[16-Sep-24 09:12 AM] jcheung#0000
i don't think an AML would be a great choice for you starting out


[16-Sep-24 09:12 AM] jcheung#0000
it's very, very expensive to build


[16-Sep-24 09:13 AM] martinswdev#0000
yeah saw it was like 1.8m haha


[16-Sep-24 09:13 AM] laaxus#0000
agree, but that falls under 1) and 7)


[16-Sep-24 09:13 AM] martinswdev#0000
Will keep it there for later whilst I look at BFabs


[16-Sep-24 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
actually it falls under "AGP is too small to fund even one"


[16-Sep-24 11:19 AM] martinswdev#0000
So looking at setting up on Nike instead with 1 EXT and 8 PP2. 650k build and 200k supplies for 3 days doing just BBH. leaves some room if I need to swap out for a different BFab. 28k profit and 24days ROI

yeah will be shopping around for best prices


[16-Sep-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
I would also consider producing lfabs and not bfabs as they are more profitable but you do you


[16-Sep-24 11:58 AM] martinswdev#0000
yeah I saw that but Tanda was saying they are regularly short bfabs ? Can mix it in a bit I guess depending on whats needed


[16-Sep-24 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
So bfabs have the MM to help keep the price low (ish)


[16-Sep-24 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Which unfortunately simultaneously drives people away from making them because they're less profitable


[16-Sep-24 12:07 PM] razenpok#0000

It's probably a money sink the devs added to remove more money from circulation

It doesn't really make sense to make it that cheap


[16-Sep-24 12:08 PM] jcheung#0000
sure, but it also does artificially lower bfab price and therefore profit margin


[16-Sep-24 12:08 PM] razenpok#0000

LFABS are good margin but honestly you guys buy me out BFABs on a regular basis


[16-Sep-24 12:44 PM] martinswdev#0000
Yeah I will start off with BBH and just adjust as needed 🙂


[16-Sep-24 12:46 PM] akyantor#0000
The bfabs fly off the shelf on the market too at your ask price. At least based upon my recent experience, which isn’t as true for lfabs.


[16-Sep-24 12:53 PM] laaxus#0000
He  could sell Lfabs at bid price, and have a better ROI than selling bfabs at ask


[16-Sep-24 01:13 PM] tanda#0000
I don't have numbers up to talk about this right now, but consistency is key for a second base. LFABs aren't that consistent, even with those bids out there.


[16-Sep-24 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
it's not like he can't switch recipes and start producing Bfabs again if those recipe becomes less profitable


[16-Sep-24 01:26 PM] martinswdev#0000
Yeah it looks fine to me, plenty of demand on the bfabs even if margins are bit less


[16-Sep-24 01:27 PM] igfloz#0000

If you are really set on extracting LST and having PP2


[16-Sep-24 01:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would do 2 EXT, 12 PP2,  2 HB1, 1 HB2, 3 HBB, and 3 STO


[16-Sep-24 01:53 PM] jcheung#0000
don't forget they need to stock it with that mil too

...and then cover the inevitable goof-up


[16-Sep-24 01:54 PM] martinswdev#0000

you can do that eventually


[16-Sep-24 01:55 PM] martinswdev#0000

and i can't keep these darn things in stock


[16-Sep-24 02:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
All I'm gonna say is if you use some internal pricing on BFABs and LFABs is that the full 2 EXT and 12 PP2 is very achievable

[16-Sep-24 02:02 PM] martinswdev#0000
Yeah I expect that once I get into the flow of things that we can add some more pp2, but might find a pp3 is useful, hard to tell just yet

Manufacturing gang here


[16-Sep-24 02:10 PM] martinswdev#0000
Oh I’m sure it will sell, it’s more will I screw something up  and will it be worth adding something complementary there in addition or just maxing out the pp2 haha just trying to be cautious about going up to the limit straight away


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
small steps


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well PP2 inputs are arguably pretty cheap compared to say like PP3 or PP4 or not absurdly heavy like PP1


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
upgrade if you feel you can handle it


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
test waters first


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could add WEL and make TRU or MHL

{Reactions}
truss 

[16-Sep-24 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but according to my calculations you should be able to get the full 500 filled out for about 600k leaving you with 400k for inputs


[16-Sep-24 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Just some food for thought


[16-Sep-24 02:15 PM] martinswdev#0000
Does the WEL get bonus from construction too ? That might be a good move regardless


[16-Sep-24 02:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes it does

Speaking from ongoing personal experience, don't do a full WEL base. Nothing but TRU moves fast enough out of it


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] martinswdev#0000
Have update it to have 3 STO and 1 WEL. Leaves room for 2-3 extra PP2 and a PP3 if needed (with the extra /optimised infrastructure)


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
3 STO seems A LOT


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
1 STO is good


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well AL and LST is HEAVY


[16-Sep-24 02:46 PM] laaxus#0000
it would be better to rent 4 warehouse and have one more revenue making building


[16-Sep-24 02:47 PM] martinswdev#0000
I can drop it down to 1 for now, can sort that if it becomes a problem I guess


[16-Sep-24 02:47 PM] laaxus#0000
start with 1, rent 4 warehouse and then see if you need more sto


[16-Sep-24 02:47 PM] igfloz#0000
Personally, I'd go for 2 STO and whatever WH you need. If you want to ever stock 10day (?) stocks, 2 STO will help you


[16-Sep-24 02:48 PM] igfloz#0000
LST is huge


[16-Sep-24 02:48 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd be OK with 2


[16-Sep-24 02:48 PM] laaxus#0000
but 3 seems too much


[16-Sep-24 02:53 PM] martinswdev#0000
2 STO with optimise infrastrucutre, 2 EXT, 1 WEL and  12 PP2 comes to exectly 500


[16-Sep-24 02:54 PM] martinswdev#0000
Have updated a reduced version of that so cost is around 750k for buildings

Make sure you have enough habitat for workers too 🙂


[16-Sep-24 02:56 PM] martinswdev#0000
Yeah 2 HB1 and 3 HBB, so wil need another HBB for 4 more PP2 later on


[16-Sep-24 02:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ok still shouldn't cost 750k tho Input these numbers into your PrUn Planner CX settings https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1254643011980234863/1285318800685928508

[16-Sep-24 02:59 PM] martinswdev#0000
ok yeah I put those ones above in and it saying 466k for buildings, so maybe I can get those other 4 pp2

pink is below yellow
so if you get that role, you'd be yellow

I don’t think you’re technically required to be a coordinator to donate - anyone can do it, and I don’t know if there’s any rules around the coordinator role either. That’s up to Jvaler 😄


[16-Sep-24 03:57 PM] igfloz#0000
oh, booo ! I was looking to mess up Hal's life just a little (I'm joking) 😛

Honestly, I think the whole business case part of the grant can help newer players get comfortable taking a loan


[16-Sep-24 04:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since you get to practice designing a profitable base in a (hopefully) low-stakes environment

[17-Sep-24 09:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I really wish there was a better way to calculate equity…


[17-Sep-24 09:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My HQ upgrades and ships are gone into the void


[17-Sep-24 09:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
On paper my equity is 15 mil but Im a bit competitive and I’d really like to know what my « score » is


[17-Sep-24 09:37 AM] razenpok#0000
Technically, HQ upgrades and ships cannot be considered equity, as they cannot be liquidated


[17-Sep-24 09:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Just ships I have spent 30mil


[17-Sep-24 09:37 AM] razenpok#0000
If we talk in a classic definition of equity


[17-Sep-24 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
Players should be able to sell ships tbh


[17-Sep-24 09:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’d say it’s still an asset and should be accounted as such


[17-Sep-24 09:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Even is its illiquid


[17-Sep-24 09:40 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
91 days… already 3 months


[17-Sep-24 09:40 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Time flies


[17-Sep-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
You only have 15m worth of base ?


[17-Sep-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
Thought you would have more


[17-Sep-24 09:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Well I have 7 ships and HQ 21


[17-Sep-24 09:44 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
All that is losses as far as equity is concerned


[17-Sep-24 09:46 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But my equity is fucked as well since it factors in all the interest I will have to pay on the deposits of Shrewdbank


[17-Sep-24 09:46 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
With 250 mil in deposits that about 50mil in costs accounted as of now even if its going to be paid over the next 10 weeks


[17-Sep-24 09:48 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My real equity is I think between 60 and 80 mil I’d wager


[17-Sep-24 09:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
Damn that’s definitely a boost 😅 I am sitting at 5m (2 months)


[17-Sep-24 09:54 AM] marat_sh#0000
But I assume the game will slow down quite a bit with more HQ upgrades


[17-Sep-24 10:05 AM] realharvey#0000
It also slows down if you sell more and more at internal less profitable prices


[17-Sep-24 10:05 AM] realharvey#0000
And if you need more ships


[17-Sep-24 10:08 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah - I think part of the reason my equity has been level instead of increasing the past few weeks is because I haven’t built any bases and sell a ton at internal prices 😄


[17-Sep-24 10:11 AM] realharvey#0000
We distribute our equity into freshfolk :D

[19-Sep-24 02:58 AM] .nvf#0000
So, my theory is.


[19-Sep-24 02:58 AM] .nvf#0000
The only difference between extracting my own aluminium ore and buying it from the exchange


[19-Sep-24 02:59 AM] .nvf#0000
is the price difference between the orders, and the shipping cost


[19-Sep-24 02:59 AM] .nvf#0000
if I eat that, then I save on space, I can have way more smelters to benefit from Deimos' bonus


[19-Sep-24 02:59 AM] jvaler#0000
100% correct


[19-Sep-24 02:59 AM] .nvf#0000
Excellent


[19-Sep-24 03:00 AM] .nvf#0000
And if I stay flexible, I don't need to worry if the aluminium market crashes, I can just smelt something else


[19-Sep-24 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah
Imagine you sell you AL at ASK price
Then you buy that same AL at ask price
No difference


[19-Sep-24 03:00 AM] .nvf#0000
Yeah! Capitalism!


[19-Sep-24 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000
so when you're considering producing your own input goods, you should look at "does producing this good at ask price looks profitable"


[19-Sep-24 03:01 AM] .nvf#0000
I discovered this revelation from playing Vic3. Why bother digging up my own iron when I'm already a member of a market that has a shitload of iron. I might as well use that iron to make something better and sell that"


[19-Sep-24 03:01 AM] jvaler#0000
an alarming number of players don't get this, so i'm tempted to just go ahead and send you the grant just because you do lmfao


[19-Sep-24 03:01 AM] .nvf#0000
ahahah


[19-Sep-24 03:01 AM] .nvf#0000
I've reset twice already, first time was because I picked manufacturing then wanted to do fuel. Second time was because fuel had an absolute garbage return


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000
(please do a plan on prunplanner just in case tho)


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] jvaler#0000
sounds like the plan is just gonna be 20 SME


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000
which isn't a bad plan


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] .nvf#0000
I couldn't figure out prunplanner, so I messed around with the excel one on the apex resources thing


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] .nvf#0000
then when I couldn't update the pricing on that because I use opera not chrome, I made my own


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000
you should try to figure out prunplanner


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000
it's worth it


[19-Sep-24 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000
what do you do not understand


[19-Sep-24 03:03 AM] jvaler#0000
those work too, i'm just sketched out by their jank sometimes


[19-Sep-24 03:03 AM] .nvf#0000
It was asking for things I didn't understand how to provide


[19-Sep-24 03:04 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah you basically gotta reverse engineer the sheet to understand how it works lmfao


[19-Sep-24 03:04 AM] jvaler#0000
whereas with prunplanner

[19-Sep-24 03:04 AM] .nvf#0000
for now I just manually input all the prices in to my spreadsheet, and it calculates all the recipes for me


[19-Sep-24 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
PLEASE DONT XD


[19-Sep-24 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
at least use importdata for the prices


[19-Sep-24 03:05 AM] .nvf#0000
I have no idea how to do that


[19-Sep-24 03:05 AM] laaxus#0000
what language do you speak ?


[19-Sep-24 03:05 AM] .nvf#0000
I'm only collecting the ore, metal, and a few random other things, it takes like two minutes


[19-Sep-24 03:06 AM] .nvf#0000
Just this one


[19-Sep-24 03:06 AM] jvaler#0000
`=IMPORTDATA("https://rest.fnar.net/csv/prices")`


[19-Sep-24 03:06 AM] laaxus#0000
want a quick discord call on how to use prunplanner ?


[19-Sep-24 03:06 AM] .nvf#0000
oh good lord


[19-Sep-24 03:07 AM] .nvf#0000
When does this update?


[19-Sep-24 03:07 AM] laaxus#0000
every 5m or so


[19-Sep-24 03:07 AM] .nvf#0000
I'm not really a call kinda person


[19-Sep-24 03:07 AM] .nvf#0000

[19-Sep-24 03:09 AM] jvaler#0000
there's other useful endpoints too https://doc.fnar.net/#/csv and https://api.fnar.net/index.html

api.fnar.net is the newer WIP one being made so there may be some bugs


[19-Sep-24 03:11 AM] jvaler#0000
some of them may require your FIO api key, but those are the most useful ones imo

I think that's what I didn't know how to get


[19-Sep-24 03:21 AM] .nvf#0000
So, not quite. I'm gonna have a few oxygen collectors, just to save on shipping


[19-Sep-24 03:22 AM] .nvf#0000
and either stockpile it for when I need it, or sell it off in bulk on the LM


[19-Sep-24 03:27 AM] jvaler#0000
go to your settings on the FIO website


[19-Sep-24 03:27 AM] jvaler#0000

Iron is a pain in the ass to haul. Shit's heavy


[19-Sep-24 04:37 AM] jcheung#0000
O on deimos?


[19-Sep-24 04:37 AM] jcheung#0000
Eh... if you're going to do that, produce only enough for yourself, maybe a little less


[19-Sep-24 04:38 AM] .nvf#0000
I was talking about in Victoria3, hauling doesn't exist in that game


[19-Sep-24 04:39 AM] jcheung#0000
Yes, but i was saying iron here sucks to move


[19-Sep-24 04:39 AM] .nvf#0000
fair... maybe I'll run in to throughput issues when i build 30 smelters, but that's an issue for another day


[19-Sep-24 05:36 AM] jvaler#0000
@.nvf imma go ahead and send u the grant cont


[19-Sep-24 05:36 AM] .nvf#0000
Ooh, thanks!


[19-Sep-24 07:49 AM] firemonkeh#0000
Hey guys, I'm new to PrUn the past couple days and I've come cap-in-hand 😛. I started as a Manufacturer and selected by the CX on Phobos (by accident but I see that as very good now) and I came up with a plan to basically build like 10 basic factories (BMP) and churn out mostly PE as it has the volume to support me scaling it and I can get the ingredients at a good price, plus I can do small amounts of the other items to be safe.

I looked at that Prunplanner linked above(which is amazing btw) and can see that this would work though I also need more habs for people and it's around 400k to build which, unless I am mistaken, at my current rate will take literally weeks of low margin trades, occasionally moving small quantities of goods on slow boat shipments to manage fuel costs. I will probably push through that as best I can and it's good to get an idea of where the main costs are, but I know the daily upkeep and fuel are going to slow down my growth.

It seems Phobos has a bonus for electronics I think? So it might make sense to branch into that after this is going but I'd want to get a basic thing going and play with some base/production plans. I did a lot of station trading in EVE and I can see some decent options for that as well which is cool. 

So yeah, if someone wouldn't mind sanity checking me I'd appreciate it, thanks! Also happy to just chat about other stuff Prun too, seems there is a lot of depth to the game and others to learn from.


[19-Sep-24 08:41 AM] farnite#0000
What do you guys think about adding another fuel refiner?  I'm thinking about adding a base to do just FF supply, importing everything from cx.  It's kind of expensive from a daily supply perspective, but FF has been on a tear and it feels like supply issues.  Would need some funding and happy to talk details - I'm finally around a couple of weeks in the game and feeling more confident about what I am doing.  ps prunplanner is awesome


[19-Sep-24 08:50 AM] jvaler#0000
ngl phobos sucks as a planet for new players. proximity to CX doesn't matter when you're not constrained by logistics, and it's CoGC bonus is utterly useless to new players.

have you looked into moving over to hephaestus? it's just as close to the CX but has a manufacturing CoGC


[19-Sep-24 08:51 AM] jvaler#0000
fuel has definitely been rising in price, so if the numbers work out favorably i don't see why not


[19-Sep-24 08:52 AM] farnite#0000
Here is what I was thinking: https://prunplanner.org/shared/60858ef5-9ec6-4848-8648-30274712c1be - starting smaller with 5 refineries to make sure the market can absorb the additional supply.  I would plan to increase further from my own funds down the road sometime.

[19-Sep-24 08:58 AM] jvaler#0000
you have corp HQ marked on this, you plan on making one?


[19-Sep-24 08:59 AM] jvaler#0000

So right now my corp hq is on harmonia where I'm doing RAT farming


[19-Sep-24 09:00 AM] farnite#0000
Which is not really very valuable, this would be much mor evaluable so I'd transfer it I think


[19-Sep-24 09:00 AM] jvaler#0000
nono that's your company HQ


[19-Sep-24 09:00 AM] jvaler#0000
corp HQ is different


[19-Sep-24 09:00 AM] farnite#0000
Oh really?


[19-Sep-24 09:01 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah, corps are the ingame player groups you can make, and the corp HQ is something you construct within them

[19-Sep-24 09:01 AM] jvaler#0000
it's one of the only functionalities of corps in the game atm lol


[19-Sep-24 09:02 AM] farnite#0000
That is interesting, okay cool


[19-Sep-24 09:02 AM] farnite#0000
Even without that bonus it's still a good investment though on the ff plan


[19-Sep-24 09:03 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah the screenshot i took was without it

err wait, forgot to include CM


[19-Sep-24 09:03 AM] jvaler#0000
13d with CM


[19-Sep-24 09:03 AM] jvaler#0000
still great


[19-Sep-24 09:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
Was looking over it - note you’ve got a lot of volume import for the base. Should be okay with your two starter ships, but they might be quite busy


[19-Sep-24 09:04 AM] farnite#0000
Yup agreed, will require a lot of shipping, and maybe a ship upgrade at some point


[19-Sep-24 09:06 AM] firemonkeh#0000
Interesting, yeah that sounds like a very good idea, I'm gonna move myself to start over there. Thanks!


[19-Sep-24 10:12 AM] firemonkeh#0000

[19-Sep-24 10:08 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm still working out my plans, trying to understand my production options, but I appreciate the sort of roleplay of being the Martian community and bringing "home" what isn't native to our starter planets, such as food production and fuel production.
Current plan is a now-ongoing metallurgist start on Deimos, which will branch into some addtl extraction planets for other minerals needed by high-frequency construction & manufacturing projects (planning BER, BOR, BRM, HAL, LIO, LST, SIO).
Then once I've got more cash buffer built up, I have plans to make a basic food (or pure extractor) base on Verdant and a fuel base on Harpina (due to the massive local H source) to bring those "home" more reliably (and meet my own needs).


[19-Sep-24 10:09 PM] kynadre#0000
I worked with a lot of comparisons to find resource planets that either had bonuses or some of the highest available while still being within 12j of Antares without requiring more than 1-2 "bad weather" fixes. Many don't require any, I'm just saving up buffer to be able to set them up + start placing buy orders instead of buying at sell values (esp. those construction materials)


[19-Sep-24 10:15 PM] kynadre#0000
I'll look at a few ideas to also get CLI (soil) and TCO (TCS -> HSE). I'm having hard time telling if TAI, CUO, AUO, MGS, SCR (and their outputs) actually have demand


[19-Sep-24 10:15 PM] kynadre#0000
that's my general idea, anyway, but I'm getting experience how the game works and trying to ask good questions

[20-Sep-24 01:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Hello, I'm currently considering to expand my operations with an ore extraction site on LG-430 b for CUO. I already have a rudimentary smeltery on Deimos, which I would upgrade to support the higher flow of resources. 

Why LG-430 b? It's one of the CUO richer planetes in ANT space, is (just) 7 jumps away of AI1 and theoretically isn't that far away of Hortus, if the CU market in ANT crashes. Also it's already colonized. 

CU is currently high profitable. CUO seems to be sparse and CUO planets are few and far apart. Since I already have a AL production, it fits into my current business.

The Construction of a simple mining operation would cost around 300.000 AIC - more, if I decide to start with more EXT. For logistics I have the 2 starter ships, not sure if I should upgrade. Rest of the grand would flow into supplies and more SMT on Deimos.

The idea is to mine CUO on LG-430 b, ship it to Deimos for smelting and sell the CU to the market, maybe even CUO overflow, if there is any.

Shipping (one way) with my current ships is around 4000 AIC (with lowest speed). And with just 500 t capacity, that's around 55 units of CUO... so upgrading to a better ship would be reasonable, but I heard ships are expensive.


[20-Sep-24 01:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
As for me, I'm a relatively new player, started less then a week ago. I feel like I understood the mechanics and economy of the game, but still looking for a place in this galaxy. I would love to fill a  place in the community and market. Not sure, if CU is the right call, but everbody does AL, and CU seems something not many people are willing to mine and produce.


[20-Sep-24 01:25 AM] jcheung#0000
Have you looked at your logistics for that base?


[20-Sep-24 01:26 AM] jcheung#0000
CUO is pretty heavy, how much can you move per day to deimos?


[20-Sep-24 01:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
what do you mean?


[20-Sep-24 01:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
My current ship can fit 55 units per trip


[20-Sep-24 01:27 AM] jcheung#0000
Right, how long is a trip


[20-Sep-24 01:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
around 2 days


[20-Sep-24 01:27 AM] jcheung#0000
And how much CUO do you make per day?


[20-Sep-24 01:28 AM] jcheung#0000
Is that 2 days one way or round trip


[20-Sep-24 01:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
with all bonuses 14 units / 10 hours / EXT


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
one trip


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
lowest speed


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] jcheung#0000
When you say one trip, do you mean a round trip or one way


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
one way


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
sorry


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] jcheung#0000
Okay. What's your CUO consumption on deimos, projected


[20-Sep-24 01:29 AM] jcheung#0000
Per day


[20-Sep-24 01:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
5 units / 12 hours / SME. Currently I have 2 SME for my AL production, so depends on how many more I build up


[20-Sep-24 01:31 AM] jcheung#0000
SME*


[20-Sep-24 01:32 AM] jcheung#0000
With the numbers provided so far, with both ships hauling nonstop at those speeds, you won't even keep up with the CUO production. You have to step up the speed of your transports.


[20-Sep-24 01:33 AM] jcheung#0000
Actually. Let me rephrase that. Both ships can't handle *one* EXT at those speeds


[20-Sep-24 01:35 AM] jcheung#0000
Here's the rough breakdown with mental math and rounding:
4d round trip
55 moved per round trip
14 moved per day, per ship

1.4 generated per hour
35 generated per day per extractor


[20-Sep-24 01:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I see


[20-Sep-24 01:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so I would sit on my ore on my extraction site...


[20-Sep-24 01:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
how much would a better ship cost, approximately?


[20-Sep-24 01:38 AM] jcheung#0000
There's a guy who offers cheap upgrades to ships that can carry 748 CUO/load for around... i think 650k for the kit plus around another 1-300k for additional materials


[20-Sep-24 01:38 AM] jcheung#0000
That could convert both your starter ships (cost was per ship)


[20-Sep-24 01:39 AM] jcheung#0000
We're working on our own upgrade program but that's going slowly


[20-Sep-24 01:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yeah... even with the grand I would need around 500k own capital to attempt that


[20-Sep-24 01:40 AM] getonthetrain#0000
well, get the grant - expand what you are currently doing with 300-500k of that - then save for a ship upgrade to do the rest of your plan


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
seems reasonable


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
Huh. How did you come up with 55u for CUO btw


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
in other words - I just don't have the logistics for that, so I need a better ship


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
I'm showing 124


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
500 t for the starter ship


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
oh wait, yeah


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
Which is still horrible mind you


[20-Sep-24 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I had the weight for CU, not the ore


[20-Sep-24 01:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
which is around 9 t


[20-Sep-24 01:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
ore is just 5, right?


[20-Sep-24 01:42 AM] getonthetrain#0000
4.01


[20-Sep-24 01:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
even better


[20-Sep-24 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
At 124u/trip, one ship could support one ext with a little overhead. That's a lot of empty space on the base


[20-Sep-24 01:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it is - but it's a start xD


[20-Sep-24 01:43 AM] jcheung#0000
I suggest finding a different start


[20-Sep-24 01:44 AM] jcheung#0000
What's the profit per day with your plan of CUO


[20-Sep-24 01:44 AM] getonthetrain#0000
I find that the scrappy start is most fun - trying to make the most with limited resources


[20-Sep-24 01:44 AM] realharvey#0000
A new ship is expensive. Upgrades also set you back a decent amount of change


[20-Sep-24 01:44 AM] getonthetrain#0000
upgrade is like a million all things considered


[20-Sep-24 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
7 jumps and a permit for 2 EXTs is less than ideal

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Sep-24 01:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
just the ore - without transportation - according to prun planner - around 11.000


[20-Sep-24 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
Maybe 3 EXTs


[20-Sep-24 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
Amd after refinement, assuming it teleports?


[20-Sep-24 01:46 AM] realharvey#0000
You can sustain 1-3 full bases with the two starter ships when focussing on less heavier products


[20-Sep-24 01:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
let me quickly setup that ...


[20-Sep-24 01:46 AM] jcheung#0000
Also 11k with how many EXT


[20-Sep-24 01:49 AM] getonthetrain#0000
thats per EXT jc


[20-Sep-24 01:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
just one


[20-Sep-24 01:52 AM] jcheung#0000
Dang


[20-Sep-24 01:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If I configured it correctly - still new to the planner - its says with 1 EXT and 6 SME (which should roughly eat up all the ore), we are around 30.000 profit...

[20-Sep-24 01:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
probably not, but not sure where to look at, tbh


[20-Sep-24 01:56 AM] jcheung#0000
So assuming you can run 2 EXTs that would be... 60k/d. Hmmm. Not bad, but man.... that's a lot of logi capacity gone


[20-Sep-24 01:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the flight path between Deimos and LG-430 is throu Antares I, so I could just send both ships back and forth


[20-Sep-24 01:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
making a stop at the CX, if needed


[20-Sep-24 01:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it would work ...


[20-Sep-24 01:58 AM] jcheung#0000
Making that pitstop will add a bunch of time


[20-Sep-24 01:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
sending a ship extra too


[20-Sep-24 01:59 AM] getonthetrain#0000
you would have one ship constantly to ANT and this copper place. The other could occasionally visit Deimos, but would have to make runs too I think


[20-Sep-24 02:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
or somebody else ships my copper from deimos over to CX


[20-Sep-24 02:00 AM] jcheung#0000
It's not like you're pulling into a gas station on a road trip, you're going to the town off the side of a highway


[20-Sep-24 02:00 AM] jcheung#0000
With no nearby exits


[20-Sep-24 02:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I could use one ship non-stop and the other would ship the CU from Deimos to CX and buy supplies


[20-Sep-24 02:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
also, on trip was like 60% fuel, so thats a problem, too...


[20-Sep-24 02:02 AM] getonthetrain#0000
well, you just bring fuel in your cargo on the outbound trip


[20-Sep-24 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but still, you're right - its a lot of logistics


[20-Sep-24 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and eventuelly I need a better ship


[20-Sep-24 02:03 AM] jcheung#0000
Also


[20-Sep-24 02:04 AM] jcheung#0000
How much PIO do you need for ext again?


[20-Sep-24 02:04 AM] getonthetrain#0000
60


[20-Sep-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
Might be tight on pop


[20-Sep-24 02:05 AM] evov#0000
You could just sell you CU to someone on Deimos so you don't need to worry about the last leg of transport.


[20-Sep-24 02:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
true


[20-Sep-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
Tbh if it's going all the way there you may as well do the refinement yourself


[20-Sep-24 02:06 AM] jcheung#0000
Is a pretty big value add, and the cx distance is... acceptable


[20-Sep-24 02:06 AM] jcheung#0000
High enough traffic for LM shipping to ANT regulairly too


[20-Sep-24 02:06 AM] evov#0000
Yea, do the refinement yourself on deimos, but sell the CU there ( or put up LM adds for transport )


[20-Sep-24 02:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I mean - the grand would be enough to setup and start the operation. If it all works, I have a good supply of cash I can use to optimize, right?


[20-Sep-24 02:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
also, there is basically no loss in this game - just time


[20-Sep-24 02:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
well, except CU falls to 500 or so and the transport is more expensive then selling it, of course ...


[20-Sep-24 02:09 AM] jcheung#0000
The tricky part is convincing someone to give you grant money


[20-Sep-24 02:09 AM] jcheung#0000
Maybe you'll find someone 😅


[20-Sep-24 02:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I know - is an idea and I thought I shoot my shot.


[20-Sep-24 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
Got any backup plans?


[20-Sep-24 02:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
AL always sells ... xD


[20-Sep-24 02:10 AM] evov#0000
The safe bet, would be to stick with places that already have a cogc on them. It's a lot of efficiency to pass up by not having it, and it's a good indication that other people have already done the numbers and worked out the planet is viable for that stuff.

[20-Sep-24 02:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
other CU planets are further away or empty


[20-Sep-24 02:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I posted this discussion to see, if the CUO EXT is even a good idea and viable. CU is high right now (not sure why, tbh), but might fall if more people jump on the hype. 4000 AIC transportion per one trip is harsh, so yeah, it's risky. 

It would be safer to do, what everybody does: Expand the AL production on Deimos, setup some manufacturing. 

But I felt this does everybody. CU on the other hand is relatively rare, hard to get in ANT and (at least currently) needed.


[20-Sep-24 02:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If it fails I still have Deimos with at least 6 SME, so that's something. And some infrastructure to immediatly jump onto the CU hype again, if some comes by 😛


[20-Sep-24 02:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Either way, thank you for your all feedback. Helped me to understand more what to look at, when thinking about expanding 🙂


[20-Sep-24 02:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Just checked something - CU prices could drop to around 1.000 until I would lose money to the transport.


[20-Sep-24 02:37 AM] evov#0000
If the price dropping below a certain point is a risk, you could try to lock in a longer timeline sales contract with someone. You won't get as much per unit, but you cap the risk/downside at least.


[20-Sep-24 02:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Please correct me, if I'm wrong, but if the price on the CX is lower then I sell it to the contractor, wouldn't they drop me, too?


[20-Sep-24 02:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Since they can get I cheaper somewhere else. And it's not like there is a quality to materials - like my copper is the best in the 7 universes...


[20-Sep-24 02:43 AM] evov#0000
As an example - right now, I could by CUO on the Mor cx at 350/unit. Over the next month, maybe it goes up, maybe it goes down. Or, I could do a contract with you ( or someone that produces CUO ) where we make the contract now, but pay/deliver in 30 days from now.


[20-Sep-24 02:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
buy now, pay later. Understood 🙂


[20-Sep-24 02:44 AM] evov#0000
Well you can structure it however you want. Pay later deliver later, pay now deliver later etc etc


[20-Sep-24 02:46 AM] evov#0000

[20-Sep-24 02:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so basically we skip the CX and we both get a stable, reasonable price for the expense of (possibly) losing some revenue

You can structure it like a loan if you want. Where the person pays you now, and you deliver later ( with an expected lower price per unit instead of paying interest on the loan )


[20-Sep-24 02:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
* in the sense of selling/buying on the CX could be more profitable or more expensive, we just don't know


[20-Sep-24 02:49 AM] evov#0000
Yea, it's all just risk exposure


[20-Sep-24 02:51 AM] evov#0000
I'm just pointing out that there are financial tools and contract tools in the game that can help solve all sorts of problems (logistics, cashflow, risk exposure etc )

Hi all,
My goal is to set up a drinks empire (booze and coffee).

I currently have a full base on Antares that is based mostly around Rigs and Farmsteads.

[20-Sep-24 06:18 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I intend to use the surplus from this base 1 to help feed base 2.

My plan thus far is to:

- set up my second base in Cantillo space, move my hq there to get the ag bonus.
- Develop this 2nd base primarily on Fermentors / hydroponics


[20-Sep-24 06:19 AM] cruelcoin#0000
- Possibly a 3rd base will be needed in castillo space to feed base 2 with more farmstead/ration capacity


[20-Sep-24 06:21 AM] jvaler#0000
castillo-ito HQ location has a manufacturing bonus, not agri

and AGP is only available for antares development... if you're expanding out of antares we can't fund that unfortunately


[20-Sep-24 06:22 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I get you. Wrong region...
Happy to stay within Antares if it's viable without the correct hq bonus?


[20-Sep-24 06:22 AM] jvaler#0000
of course, very viable. the HQ bonus is considered marginal to most players


[20-Sep-24 06:23 AM] jvaler#0000
CoGC and experts matter much more

I can see myself as needing cash mostly for base storage, greater ship capacity and of course, base mats.


[20-Sep-24 06:25 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Your thoughts on the points above? (inserting antares for castillo)


[20-Sep-24 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
ship doesn't earn money, storage does not either


[20-Sep-24 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
building does


[20-Sep-24 06:25 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Fly more?


[20-Sep-24 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I recommend investing in building
With a 2 day input goods reserve


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, it would require you to fly more


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
but you have few base


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
once you earn more money you'll invest in upgrading your existing ships


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] laaxus#0000
but not now


[20-Sep-24 06:26 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I've realised the contracts for the traps they are, particularly the exploration ones, so i have much more free flight hours now.


[20-Sep-24 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I recommend trading convenience (less shipping) for more profit

there's also Demeter, but that one's way out there


[20-Sep-24 06:29 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The devs introduced those new contract mechanics, for "additional newbro income".... But unless they curtail the returns on said contracts, then the more established players would just use them as a profit engine... So now those NPC contracts are mostly for "learning and orientation". I still see people gaming the reputation, but it's as what most have said, simply bargaining rights.


[20-Sep-24 06:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

We slurp the water at SE-110c; ship it to SE-110b to grow the wheat and caffeine; and ship the rest to SE-110a to process into insta-hot meal packs, for ANT CX exports. 🙂

[20-Sep-24 06:43 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Hmmmm.

Revised plan:

1 - retain harmonia base for ration production to feed bases 2/3/4
2 - Build Rigs on 110c for water
3 - Build Farms/hydro on 110b for grain and caffeine
4 - Fermentors/processors on 110a for booze and coffee.

I would want to stick with the idea of becoming a drinks magnate, purely for the RP side of it, to keep me motivated,

Thoughts?


[20-Sep-24 06:45 AM] tanda#0000
regarding 4, 110a is also food processing

[20-Sep-24 06:45 AM] tanda#0000
ah, yeah happens easily


[20-Sep-24 06:46 AM] tanda#0000
that system is great, but you'll probably need to run your bases at half capacity on the initial build out until you can get the LCB you'll need


[20-Sep-24 06:46 AM] tanda#0000
HYF's eat a lot of water


[20-Sep-24 06:46 AM] cruelcoin#0000
LCB? Sorry, i'm not familiar with the acronyms


[20-Sep-24 06:47 AM] tanda#0000
sorry, cargo ships are generally referred to by the acronym of their cargo bay


[20-Sep-24 06:47 AM] tanda#0000
WCB- 3ktons, 1k volume
LCB - 2k tons, 2k volume
VCB - 1k Tons, 3k volume


[20-Sep-24 06:48 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Aha


[20-Sep-24 06:49 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Now i'm not going to be putting any more goods into contracts, i can probably remove some farms/rigs and add a food processor or two, on base 1.


[20-Sep-24 06:49 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I'll slap it into excell. Math it out.


[20-Sep-24 06:50 AM] tanda#0000

Thank you very much lads!
Time to go shopping.

Couple of questions if i could:
- The contract doesn't seem to be fullfilling for me, even though i have those rations in that location to fullfill? Please advise.

- what do you guys need from me in terms of progress reports for disbursement of the next 3 installments?

- Finally, what do you guys get out of it? I appreciate it, but really? Encourage a new player base to keep the game going would be my guess.

Thank you!

1) it's not meant to be fullfilled, request termination
2) nothing, your money. you do you. please don't waste it tho
3) the beginning of the game is extremmely slow. 1M AIC boost new players by 70 days. it helps retention (we don't want potential players to leave). New players is what actually grow the economy (old players must spend 10M for a new base). After 3 years of playing, you earns millions and you don't know what to with it. Jvalier is a kind soul.

* you're meant to just get 1mil... we haven't done this split payout method in forever https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHlwiZ3z110rOlRlZ97K7ezpli1TeYM_4kOwbNLhDkc/edit?gid=0#gid=0
  * who here is PT Baja Abadi? or what's their CO code? i need to get this sorted out lol

* the whole point of ADI is to develop antares, and improving new player retention by bypassing the early game slog is a great way to do that. the game gets way more engaging when you're able to do more.

Your discussion enlightens me to why CU is so expensive right now, tbf. The entire discussion revolves around 2 points. 1) CU is heavy. 2) CU is valuable. 

It makes really clear that in the entire situation, one begets the other. Because it's so heavy, the costs have to be high to offset the shipping expenses, ship expenses involved with managing its inputs. And basically it's not even free-player friendly due to the weights of it unless it's basically the -only- thing you do, which is probably also why its price is high. 

So in essence, the discussion proved why the value is essentially a sunk cost compensation for players who do it, and in fact, not actually the fantastic deal it seems like it "should" be. 

Also gives me another parameter to look at when looking at extraction bases... I had not given the weight of material enough thought!

[20-Sep-24 01:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, heavy metal slogs aren't all that terrible, if you've built up for it... However, due to the discrepancies between MCG-only (triple green worlds), and resource deposits, (be they truly viable, or at least tenable, while being close to a CX), make volume production a hard thing to do. 

You could easily re-spec core ANT worlds (ANT 1, 2, 3...), to suit such processes, but you'd be angering lots of people in doing so (investment bias regarding the long-term COGCs. A less effective option would be to just populate such near-CX, MCG worlds, with off-COGC bases. It's not the best but you'll be cutting down on the long-haul logistics that would otherwise be needed to make such heavy industries logistically viable.


[20-Sep-24 01:04 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah the market is favorable for it atm afaik. being able to buy 1k/u CAF on the CX is really good

Just enough of "stuff for me" while doing "stuff for boss" that keeps us happy


[20-Sep-24 01:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
At a certain point, it becomes less of "the boss told me to do this", and more like "i know what's coming up... we need this here, and that there".... No one else is gonna do this, since 95% of the peeps prefer to pew pew, with a few beers in their hand. Logistics is one of the few things, that I've found, which transfers to many, many games. It's probably listed under several chapters in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War", since attrition, and daily turnover play such a large part in RL affairs, which the games we play are modeled off-of.

figure out how much extra can be managed in a ship trip or how much you're making to begin with, whether it's 1 haul or more than 1 haul, whether you feel it's worth sending excess to market vs. expanding the farms...

Your choice merely depends if you like cloud-based stuff (Prunplanner), or local stuff (depreciated Prunner).

Dear lord that was expensive.
And thank god for the PRUNplanner.
That would have been a nightmare without.


[21-Sep-24 03:34 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Current plan:
1 - caffeine beans base (eta 12hrs)
2 - Rig base to make just enough water for the caffeine base needs (eta 12hrs)
3 - Once i gather enough funds, base 3 for coffee production. (eta 20 days approx)
4 - expand into ale production on base 3 (eta 40 days approx)
5 - Scale all three in line with eachother.


[21-Sep-24 03:38 AM] cruelcoin#0000
That troll 250k from yesterday (have to be pro to accept troll) came in quite in handy!


[21-Sep-24 04:28 AM] realharvey#0000
I would advise you to max out a base before you build a new one


[21-Sep-24 04:28 AM] realharvey#0000
There is enough water supply at the CX


[21-Sep-24 05:13 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I wish i had PRUN a little earlier.
I can go from 25k profit to 31.5k profit just by removing 1 farm, building 2 more food processors and adding coffee......

Ugh


[21-Sep-24 05:24 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sooo, since nobody likes my idea of bringing more CU to the market, let's do, what everybody does: MINE AL! 😜 (sarcastically)

But in all seriousness: I get the point. As @kynadre pointed out, there is a reason CU is so expensive and it might be just a bit to early for to setup that industry. So no hurt feelings on this side. 😄 

Therefore: Let's make plan B to plan A: Build up Deimos and smelt AL.

I currently still have a lot of space left on Deimos, so it makes sense to fill up those first. For the beginning I would go with a 6 EXT to 13 SME ratio. I would practically produce nearly all my ALO myself and need just a bit to top it off, or could smelt something else for higher profits. This would give me around 4.000 AIC extra profit per day. If the market shifts along the lines or I expand into other industries I might switch that up later.
 
With the current prices, this would give me a daily profit of around 42.000 AIC with a production of 114 AL per day.

Since y'all love spreedsheets I will append some with the expected construction costs and weekly supplies I would need for the base. I ends up roughly around 1 mil, so would use up the grand completely. 

I still like the idea of extracting CUO. I will further investigate into that topic, but I will be probably my third base at the earliest - provided the CU market is not gonna crash until then.

[21-Sep-24 05:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Other then that, I would love to contribute to the market in a meaningful way. I still don't have the overview of how all the different materials and production lines are interconnected and how the current supplies are covered.


[21-Sep-24 05:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If there are markets, that need more suppliers, I'm open to look into them. Other then that, I will try to check how the situation on CX is and return with ideas 😋


[21-Sep-24 06:30 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You won't get an overview... Spend 2 weeks on dredging through the BUI buffers, in-game.


[21-Sep-24 06:33 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The matrix multiplication tools (Prunplanner) are helpful... But they won't mean much if you don't learn the essentials, via the PRUN APEX wiki (googol it), the PCT wiki (https://pct.fnar.net), and traverse the game data through https://fio.fnar.net + https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch

Contributing to a market is a possibility.. But unless you know what you're doing, you'll likely be taken advantage of, by someone else.


[21-Sep-24 06:58 AM] realharvey#0000
Hey there! While I understand that it is cool, to figure stuff out with your own spreadsheets it makes it way more complicated for other folks to figure out if you did everything right with your calculations. 
We want to give players a headstart with grants and with that headstart we want so insure that you get a reliable steady income stream, that can fund your other fun adventures and ideas and make you participate in the universe in a meaningfull way.

I personally want to see a Plan in Prunplanner to agree and fund a base. There I can look at key-indicators to make sure, that what you are doing is a) profitable enough. b) has a reasonable return on investment time.  c) starter ships can handle a full base of what you are doing and d) there is enough demand in the universe and it's not a short profit adventure.

This is just my opinion on this. Other here might have other takes and thats cool. 

I'd just highly recommend getting used to prunplanner because it is a super powerfull tool and you can see in a super short timeframe wether something is worth doing or not. And it also directly points out what shipping burden that base will put onto you.


[21-Sep-24 07:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
sure, no problem 😉 the base is planned in PrunPlanner, so sending some screenshots of what I cooked there.

no need to feel dumb. This game is very in depth and we all made that mistakes


[21-Sep-24 07:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But as far as I see just one storage building should be enough to buffer materials till a ship comes by to export


[21-Sep-24 07:14 AM] realharvey#0000
I still do mistakes. I build a new base and totally forgot consumables while I totally stocked up on everything else.. 😂


[21-Sep-24 07:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
could remove a SME, still on 40.000 profit per day


[21-Sep-24 07:15 AM] realharvey#0000
your base would work even without. But it would be very vulnerble and you cant overstock some items then


[21-Sep-24 07:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
building and stocking price didn't change much


[21-Sep-24 07:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
then I have a bit of ALO overflow, but could dump it into the local market (on Deimos there are probably enough people, who will buy it), or ship it to CX


[21-Sep-24 07:18 AM] realharvey#0000
CX prices are usally better for ALO

COGCs (Chamber of Global Commerce) are a player ran building that specializes planets by giving a 25% boost to productivity for a given industry. It helps a lot to follow these as best as you can usually. Harmonia's is set to Agriculture, which benefits FRMs

multi-permiting a base provides diminished returns after the first one, halving the available area you can get from a permit

[21-Sep-24 05:37 PM] jvaler#0000
1 permit per base to maximize how much area you get from them. the first permit you spend gets you 475 area, but the 2nd and 3rd expansions only get you 250 area

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-Sep-24 05:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Newer players, have a discrete incentive to multi-permit, in the short term --- they get to cut down on logistics requirements for here and there, by concentrating stuff on discrete material compression processes. Read into it what you will. Beyond a certain point though, you should just buy PRO, buy more ships and do the 1 permit per base thing...

Basic licensees are exempt from this rule, since they have limits.

Basically this plan without

Next, either boucher or etherwind, idk


[22-Sep-24 08:48 AM] tanda#0000
looks pretty solid to me. Local water source would be Ice Station Alpha on SE-110c


[22-Sep-24 09:08 AM] kahetabi#0000
Oh, that didn't appear in planet search


[22-Sep-24 09:10 AM] kahetabi#0000
Good idea


[22-Sep-24 09:12 AM] tanda#0000
that one also has the benefit of being right next to large sources of water consumption as well


[22-Sep-24 09:12 AM] tanda#0000
so you should be able to sell excess water production


[22-Sep-24 09:15 AM] kahetabi#0000
Approx cost of setting up a base at ice station is 172k


[22-Sep-24 09:18 AM] kahetabi#0000
Maybe I'll even be able to build it within granted money sinc I'll be ordering building materials at lower price


[22-Sep-24 09:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
Thanks to whoever entered my donation into the sheet last night - I completely forgot 😄


[22-Sep-24 09:26 AM] kahetabi#0000
There's also a planet- Norwick close with food production COGC program, so I could swap from mixing both on Harmonia


[22-Sep-24 09:26 AM] laaxus#0000
in the future, not now


[22-Sep-24 09:28 AM] kahetabi#0000
You don't say


[22-Sep-24 09:28 AM] tanda#0000
there's definitly expansion options in the local area, there's even more Agri bases near by in the form of Life, Demeter, and SE-110b


[22-Sep-24 09:29 AM] tanda#0000
with two more Food Processing planets at SE-110a, and Hermes

SF is at 16 stable still


[22-Sep-24 09:46 AM] laaxus#0000

they raised it like 2 weeks ago, I think

Guess i was misremembering... again


[22-Sep-24 12:31 PM] kynadre#0000
by "they" do you mean the devs sometimes raise value of stuff to account for cost of inputs or?


[22-Sep-24 12:32 PM] kynadre#0000
cuz I did notice as a fuel start (before I restarted as metallurgy start), and the reason for restart, is that the input costs for fuel are very high for the outputs, which makes it realllly difficult for a new player any way you slice it


[22-Sep-24 12:32 PM] kynadre#0000
but it also makes sense that stuff's expensive cuz you have to settle either "get trickles of it" planets as your firsts, or settle bad condition planets that ALSO need gaseous starter materials

So I guess I should get all the materials, at least for main base, by the end of next week


[23-Sep-24 02:34 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Morning lads.

- Water base is cranking
- Caffeine base is cranking
- Starter ration base is optimised.

Thank you so much!
I did make a boo-boo in that i got to the water base and couldn't build because i hadn't upgraded my HQ beyond 2 base permits......Ugh.
Back to cx i went to do buy the stuff to ship to Harmonia to do the upgrade.
Got there in the end.

And orders placed. How often do you recommend checking them?


[23-Sep-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
Wdym checking ?


[23-Sep-24 04:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like Orders placed on the CX? bc those will just get filled as people sell into your order


[23-Sep-24 04:34 PM] kahetabi#0000
I know, but people will also outbid me, I was curious how often do I need to check orders to stay relevant


[23-Sep-24 04:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
imo if you need the supplies sooner than later I would purchase from someone's sell order rather than put a buy order up


[23-Sep-24 04:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but as for 'how often' it really depends on what you are buying


[23-Sep-24 04:38 PM] kahetabi#0000
Building materials for now


[23-Sep-24 04:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
like BBH, BDE, BSE and BTA?


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] kahetabi#0000
Yup


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
or MCG


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] kahetabi#0000
Too


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah I would check out #internal-offers and just buy from some one here


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] kahetabi#0000
Oh


[23-Sep-24 04:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you won't be waiting for as long


[23-Sep-24 04:40 PM] kahetabi#0000
Yeah, I wanted to ask is there a way to "keep money within circle"


[23-Sep-24 06:24 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah, that's a decent spot to keep it in house


[23-Sep-24 06:24 PM] jcheung#0000
Sort of


[23-Sep-24 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
Most things there are sold cheaper than market, and some things are listed at a loss


[23-Sep-24 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
.....at least what i consider to be a loss


[23-Sep-24 07:49 PM] shihidosama#0000
Hey, so how does the grant program work?


[23-Sep-24 07:49 PM] tanda#0000
You tell us what you want to do, show us a prunplanner, then someone critiques that plan to help you avoid newbie traps


[23-Sep-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
afterwards, someone gives you 1mil to enact your plan and you go on a shopping spree


[23-Sep-24 07:50 PM] shihidosama#0000
ok let me figure out the pruplanner then


[23-Sep-24 07:50 PM] shihidosama#0000
is it ok for me to ask general gameplay questions here? cos im still figuring things out


[23-Sep-24 07:52 PM] jcheung#0000

💯 👍 

[24-Sep-24 03:30 PM] kynadre#0000
I think I've got a plan worked out for optimal CF production on Deimos, just under 15 CF a day.

It perfectly uses the ALO I extract,
Most cost-efficiently makes SI using the resultant AL,
And both + O go into CF.

CF is -unavoidably necessary- for a large variety of FTL engines (SFE, MFE, QCR, RCT),
used in BWH ship shielding,
and -unavoidably necessary- for THP, 
which is critical to TSH (hot planet colonization), 
and spaceship BPT plates, BFP -> ENG engines

its price has been increasing steadily on market over the last 6 months, and 15 per day would not be in excess of current demand.

It seems the need is steady and justifiable, and is perhaps a deterrent for hot planet colonization (TSH), as well as critical for a large # of ship parts.

Especially given I now know community members who make this sort of thing, it'd be easy to set up consistent, direct trade deals over time, or myself later get into the TSH business.

I recognize the import tonnage per day is a bit steep; I'm assuming that's the carbon, but I understand that'd be dumb to make locally. Future goals may be carbon farm on Verdant and a fuel farm on Harpina.

Let me know your thoughts 🙏 
Plan assumes 5 metallurgist experts and 1 extraction expert

I would need just 1 more area space to build the last HB1, lol


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Should consider a STO


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] kynadre#0000
what's an STO?


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Under HB5


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Storage


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] kynadre#0000
OH yes


[24-Sep-24 03:45 PM] jcheung#0000

[24-Sep-24 03:46 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, that makes sense


[24-Sep-24 03:48 PM] kynadre#0000

[24-Sep-24 03:49 PM] kynadre#0000
I'll make more copies and add


[24-Sep-24 03:50 PM] jcheung#0000
I would trim an EXT and see if a SME can be placed

[24-Sep-24 03:50 PM] jcheung#0000
Importing ALO isn't the worst thing


[24-Sep-24 03:50 PM] kynadre#0000
the proportions of the EXT and SME are balanced with each other so I don't have to import or buy any ALO or AL, but that does make sense


[24-Sep-24 03:51 PM] kynadre#0000
was just thinking of import weights


[24-Sep-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. But you still get the bulk of your ALO this way, and just need to top off

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Sep-24 03:51 PM] kynadre#0000
plus all the local producers


[24-Sep-24 03:52 PM] kynadre#0000
That's a good point, since so many people are mining ALO here anyway


[24-Sep-24 03:54 PM] kynadre#0000
Oh God that makes things look really gross, profit stays the same if I cut out EXTs and go up to 20 SMEs but import goes up to 400 m3 and almost 600t per day


[24-Sep-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Right, which is why i said trim one EXT


[24-Sep-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Keeps it sub 300t


[24-Sep-24 03:55 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, makes sense


[24-Sep-24 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Which is still like. A starter every other day. Less if you get someobe else to get you ALO locally

I don't recommend local O


[24-Sep-24 04:00 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, I can see that. It drastically affects shipping tonnage but it does reduce profit once STO is added in


[24-Sep-24 04:00 PM] jcheung#0000
It's not like the worst thing, but if you're going to extract, ALO is arguably better


[24-Sep-24 04:01 PM] kynadre#0000
my main consideration there was how steep the import logistical demand was for it


[24-Sep-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
You're pro right?


[24-Sep-24 04:01 PM] kynadre#0000
yes


[24-Sep-24 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
I can see if i can simply ship in O for you if you're interested


[24-Sep-24 04:02 PM] kynadre#0000
I mean, that's a fair point that shipping contracts are a very valid way to address this


[24-Sep-24 04:02 PM] kynadre#0000

ultimately the 4EXT 15SME 1STO makes slightly more profit (and 1.5 more CF per day, 18.5 instead of 16.5 or 17) but it does require a lot of importing, 
Whichever way I go with Deimos, I'd likely set up my next bases to support the SIO and C needs (and fuel, and food) to reduce cost


[24-Sep-24 04:35 PM] kynadre#0000
Appreciate you guys taking the time here and definitely appreciate the advice ❤️


[24-Sep-24 04:36 PM] kynadre#0000
It's extremely good practice to look at these variables and experiment with different ideas.


[24-Sep-24 04:43 PM] kynadre#0000
as it is though here's what pure smelting looks like for CF... not a good move shipping-wise


[24-Sep-24 04:47 PM] manhim#0000
How would it look like if you'd source your AL or SI elsewhere so you can dedicate more of your production capacity on CF?

[24-Sep-24 04:52 PM] kynadre#0000
Also there's no planet with both ALO and SIO (more than a trickle) with an extraction COGC, so that'd be breaking new ground, essentially. Would have to be a long-term plan

some opportunity bonus minerals if I plan separate planets, just that'll take a while to get to


[24-Sep-24 04:58 PM] kynadre#0000
makes sense as a future growth / adaptation opportunity once I've got more and bigger ships, can support dedicated extraction planets, etc. The current plan is as my first planet fill-out before I look at making a 2nd base, accounting for using starter ships + making it free/basic friendly (as a just in case)


[24-Sep-24 05:03 PM] kynadre#0000
Oh yeah, if I plan to buy ALO locally on Deimos (thanks, newbro metallurgists) the imports drop to 200m3/315t per day


[24-Sep-24 05:06 PM] kynadre#0000
buying AL would not be a smart move without serious pre-planning to grab deals

[24-Sep-24 05:10 PM] kynadre#0000
To sum up I'm proposing this plan as the most efficient cost/shipping while maintaining profit margins, as new-player first-base friendly, which can be (eventually) converted to pure SME when extraction support planets are established; #s are above, sorry it kinda fills channel


[24-Sep-24 05:11 PM] kynadre#0000
CF requires a biiit to make work, so this minimizes the import volumes of high volume, low cost/good with local extraction (which makes a HUGE difference in shipping)


[24-Sep-24 05:11 PM] kynadre#0000
see the plans above the replied-to to compare ❤️

The CX is just, for me, the method with the least amount of friction or drama involved. Most of the time when I put up an offer, some windowlicker will want to argue over the details and I find myself wasting more time than it's worth to buy 2 days worth of AL supply that I could resolve in 20seconds on the CX.

Hurry up and start a RIG base on SE-110c. 😛


[25-Sep-24 11:08 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The metrics for efficient water extraction, on a resource dense, but environmentally harsh world, are only slightly less than if say you were on Boucher/Etherwind. You do, however get issues, when you compound I/Os, with subsequent harsh-environment COGCs, like HYFs, FP, or CHPs, all on INS+HSE worlds.


[25-Sep-24 12:33 PM] kynadre#0000
OH so planetary management also has to have projects and inputs too for the hazards? Or do you mean the ships?


[25-Sep-24 01:04 PM] jvaler#0000
no, planetary infrastructure and upkeep is unaffected by planet conditions. they cost the same no matter what


[25-Sep-24 01:05 PM] jvaler#0000

{Reactions}

[25-Sep-24 03:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Correct, per this.


[25-Sep-24 03:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But consider this. For any volumetric-type of production, you'll want significant volumes being threaded through MCG-only, respective COGC planets... There's only so many.... I'll give an example per my speciality.


[25-Sep-24 03:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If I wanted to install a nice HYF operation, with RIG inputs, and FP outputs, all differentiated by their own bases... I'd have to install RIGs at Etherwind, or Ice Station Alpha... Import to Harmonia for HYFs. And then export to x2 FPs.... There's only 1 FP planet nearby... I could export to Hermes additionally..... But it's quite the trip.


[25-Sep-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
hermes is for demeter


[25-Sep-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're exporting from harmonia you use norwick


[25-Sep-24 03:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
(I need 2 nearby FPs, for any of my 1 permit HYF installations).

Installing FPs on a non-COGC planet, requires 900k installation cost, with ~60k net profits daily (I know this is the case, since I sell all of my outputs within 1-2 days on the CXs. PP is very reliable with my industrial selection. Installing on a pro-COGC planet, for FPs, warrants the same costs, but with an added profit margin on 10k, daily.

Installing on a COGC planet thus has its limitations, since I only get 1, within the industrial permutation of Antares (this is quite similar to other areas). So I could install on a speciality, but harsh, FP COGC planet. That'll involve at least another 1.1 mil in expenditures. 

Should the CX ever run short of INS + HSE, I'm screwed on such speciality planets. Should the CX ever become short on LBH and/or MHLs, I'm screwed on my HYF installations. <-- I'm scared of these situations... Since We've been getting like 10-20 newbros joining Prun every week, for several months now....


[25-Sep-24 03:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The lemma for this.... Basic raw extraction break-evens (like say H2O on Ice Station Alpha)... are virtually unaffected by plantetary environments.... These sorts of things tend to chain together, should you become reliant upon pure COGC planning. One harsh COGC, to another harsh COGC, to yet another harsh COGC.... The break even prices compound on one another, in that situation... And it's not a pretty picture when you're reliant upon CX sales turnovers, for such schemes...


[25-Sep-24 03:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So in like three, six, or even 12 months... A lot of players are going to be faced with rather difficult situations, in attempting to keep production costs down, to stay competitive. There's added layers to this mix as well (POPR reports, logistical routes, parsec distances, et.c.).

It's a good exercise, at the very least. Most higher tier constraints aren't backed by MM orders, and you're basically forced to be at the whim of market activity, if you haven't planned accordingly.

Hello everyone, 👋 
Here's a business proposal for a small start-up on Deimos. The idea here is not to maximize the capacity of the base but rather to :
- keep a 30% margin (On 1M invest) on the cost of construction to adapt to changing markets or errors 
-  focus mainly on the production of AL AND (CU or CF, it will depend on market cap)
- not to tackle directly a market too complicated. 

The idea is to establish a stable revenue stream, and then move on to more interesting, but also more complex and expensive, industries.

EXT 3 - SME 6 - 27k/days - ROI 14,2d

basically, cu don't sell


[25-Sep-24 04:26 PM] laaxus#0000
and to be able to make it cheaper and therefore increase demands, you'd need a cu extraction, which there isn't in ant proximity
Edit : jvaler called for it


[25-Sep-24 04:26 PM] jvaler#0000
~~that doesn't make it cheaper, the extraction just produces you extra value...~~


[25-Sep-24 04:27 PM] laaxus#0000
and shipping cuo is hell, so you'd need to smelt it near the extraction site

[25-Sep-24 04:28 PM] kynadre#0000
we've had multiple analyses in the past two weeks that have raised alarms about just how HEAVY CUO is to ship, requiring often 500+m3/t per day in shipping to smelt in reasonable volume


[25-Sep-24 04:28 PM] kynadre#0000
which, of course, is precisely why its value is misleading. The hidden steep cost of shipping fuel & ships tied up


[25-Sep-24 04:29 PM] laaxus#0000
+ there isn't much demand anyway

the absolute worst thing you can produce is something that doesn't sell


[25-Sep-24 04:30 PM] laaxus#0000
you can do it, but then you must rely on bid offers


[25-Sep-24 04:31 PM] kynadre#0000
smelting it requires both SIO and CUO so it adds up pretty hardcore. For reference, I tossed it into my 20-SME test base


[25-Sep-24 04:31 PM] kynadre#0000
So while the profit indicator is tempting at first, the fact that you need essentially 4 tons of product moving every day (2 tons one direction, slightly over 2 tons another) is a masssssive cost

just looking at the math on my end since CUO keeps coming up


[25-Sep-24 04:35 PM] gnarlicious#0000
Hm, interesting points.
Regarding financing:
I don't really know which is preferable, I've seen that some payments can be made in instalments. Offering an intermediary solution means you can stagger the setting up of the base.
The rest of the development is simply an increase in the HB and SME ratio.

As far as the weight of materials is concerned, I've concentrated a lot on the export/import ratio to take advantage of the round trips, but with your feedback.
Moving towards CF production is probably the best solution.


[25-Sep-24 04:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Scalability, is determined over several permits, via COGC efficiencies + shipping... A given model can be plastered over many locations... The question is.. Why CUO --> CU?

If you are wanting to stagger the deployment of a full base you can just do that yourself. And just squirrel away the needed resources and or cash left over from the grant to roll out the rest of your base. No one is gonna force you to fill out an entire base and you might find it beneficial to start smaller and work up or you might find it better to just make the whole base.

That’s why we pay the lump sum out so that it can be up to your discretion

[25-Sep-24 04:46 PM] kynadre#0000
Given that the shipping mass is the challenge, it'd be good to look for a settlespot that produces O and/or CUO to be the smelter base with some local EXT, perhaps? Since otherwise it takes a ship each direction daily for every 4 SME you have devoted to CUO

Personally I had like 4 or 5 EXT on Nascent making ALO when I first started (which taught me about the game and how it worked) but was a really dumb starting idea for a longevity perspective


[25-Sep-24 04:48 PM] kynadre#0000
been a solid starting idea for me on Deimos, however; producing the heaviest thing locally is a major headache saver even if it reduces your "efficiency" a bit


[25-Sep-24 04:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If you started on Deimos *I* think it’s fine to throw in some EXT or COL to get O and ALO on planet, but that shouldn’t be long term

There's discrete limitations, for almost **ANY** newbro in-game. If you wanna go big, you need to spend several year dedicated with PRUN PRO, +.


[25-Sep-24 04:51 PM] kynadre#0000
essentially each COL will make 20 O per day on Deimos, but you'd need 30 per day per SME, so that adds up really quick


[25-Sep-24 04:51 PM] kynadre#0000
but that's basically 40 tons per SME saved, daily

[25-Sep-24 04:55 PM] kynadre#0000
At Deimos you'd need 14COL with 8SME to "break even" on O to reduce to 600t shipping each way. 
With 12COL/10SME you still need about 900t shipping each way every day


[25-Sep-24 04:55 PM] laaxus#0000
please import the o


[25-Sep-24 04:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You get better O at Etherwind, or ANT.CX.


[25-Sep-24 04:55 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah just saying it's bad how many COL have to be devoted to it; Deimos is NOT good for that, so isn't good for CUO production basically (which sucks, I feel for ya)


[25-Sep-24 04:58 PM] jvaler#0000
last i checked a few months ago deimos COL & EXT were basically the same for profits, interesting that the recent ALO price increase has changed that


[25-Sep-24 04:59 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm sure there's another planet that locally produces CUO and/or O same-system that'd be a great choice for local CU production, just Deimos isn't it unfortunately


[25-Sep-24 04:59 PM] kynadre#0000
it's really the weight of O and CUO combined that's the issue (and output shipping of CU); SIO is a very small part of the smelt recipe


[25-Sep-24 05:00 PM] jvaler#0000
SE-648c is the O planet. liquid resources are far better than atmo or mineral resources, because you can fit 35 RIG in 475 area vs 14 EXT or ~22 COL

Unless you're also building some FS out there to turn the copper into... less coppery things... you're still going to be stuck transporting lots of heavy stuff a long way.

Ideally, imo, have a REX planet on good copper somewhere, and in the same system a Metalurgy planet. Do smelting there and also do FS there turning lots of CU into BCO. Line that up with other people who make lots of LI / BE... find an electronics base and $$$$

Hello everyone, after a good night's sleep and trying to ingest the various information and constraints to manage with a fairly resilient production base here's a proposed plan that respects the following constraints: 
- Production / export volume: < 500t / m2 per day
- Market resilience (3 different productions, which can be modulated according to AL, ALO, O trends) with good market absorption capacity.
- depend exclusively on pioneers for manpower

This plan is the first step, which could later evolve into a second base for food production, for example.


https://prunplanner.org/shared/c14ac818-f47b-4ab5-aa60-a95361f9e20c

In your opinion, does this fairly classic plan seem more viable?

If you chase after money, yes your nose will lead you to where it smells the best... But just because something smells nice, does not mean it looks good, or is pleasant to deal with.

Gnar, lets see..


[26-Sep-24 06:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm surprised to see, that producing you own O on Deimos isn't that much worse then importing it...


[26-Sep-24 06:48 AM] gnarlicious#0000
As I've read on the channel and also it's mainly the increase in the price of ALO that makes it more profitable than oxygen. But my aim is to take advantage of this base to make it a production base rather than a refinement base.
Production necessarily produces a bit of wealth and allows me to use it for other bases in the area that might need it (agriculture base).


[26-Sep-24 07:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just potential options.

[26-Sep-24 07:21 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you'd want some production, for end-retail use, on the CX, you'll likely have to add an additional permit, or two, else you'll be cutting out potential AL production volumes. Or just set up something on Nike. Deimos will constrain your potential weekly shipping, if you don't upgrade your ships, or don't go for a multi-permit application. 

But your plan is viable, for a PIO base, that aims at steady CX business.

Should i build FP on water extraction planet to cover DW burn?


[26-Sep-24 08:24 AM] jvaler#0000
this looks good! you plan on swapping out EXT/COL balance based on the market too? that's great

i'll send you your grant once i get home


[26-Sep-24 08:34 AM] gnarlicious#0000
Thx 🙏 
Yes, that's the objective, as long as the EXC/CO swap is not too high.

For infrastructure construction, with the explosion in the cost of building materials, do you know of any suppliers with a reasonable price in our trade area?


[26-Sep-24 08:36 AM] jvaler#0000
explosion in cost? bfabs have basically always been pinned to the market maker. they're one of the most stable things in the universe :P

but #internal-offers is where you'll find deals within ADI

Hello Sharks!
**I am Salty X and ready to smelt ALO to AIC with your generous start up boost of 1 000 000 AIC!**

We are looking at approx **__16 day ROI on 875k__** by shamelessly copying the noob metallurgist setup from *OOG Capital Managment* guide, with tiny adjustment.
Using up every centimeter on that 500 area, we gonna print up to 57k profit in a DAY!

Little candy for the eye: https://prunplanner.org/shared/28cdec80-d3a0-4dc1-9135-9e7c3a882757

Once that plan is successfully executed, we're going to add permit and expand on Extractors to dig that sweet ALO in house. 
By adding 8 extractors we are in the sweet spot of producing tiny excess ALO for our 20 smelters and being used up exactly 750 area.
Neting almost 90k profit a DAY!

And by then only the sky is limit. 
Adding another permit to increase the production or produce input material in house for reduced costs and increased profits.
Or flying out to colonize another planet for funsies, who knows? I don't, because I'm noob and this is way too far for me to think atm.

**Dear AGP Sharks, are you willing to invest in Salty X?
**


[30-Sep-24 03:32 PM] igfloz#0000
A wonderfully written request !

A suggestion, don't wast on expanding to 750 - you will need those permits in the future. You "could" rely on others to supply your ALO


[30-Sep-24 03:32 PM] saltymaggot#0000
Rather expand on another planet?


[30-Sep-24 03:32 PM] igfloz#0000
...I'm sure others that can fulfill your submission will see all of the above and give guidance


[30-Sep-24 03:33 PM] igfloz#0000
There are a number  of ways you can go - but generally yes, a permit is for a planet - not an expansion

Also, you should probably consider putting at least 1 STO on that planet. It's going to be hard to balance or buildup any kind of inventory without one.

You can remove 1 HB1 since you're not using the pioneers for it. Otherwise, if you add 1 more STO you get the same base I have xD

I am one (I'm sure there are many) of people bringing ALO to Deimos for smelting - so you should be able to hit someone up for a regular supply


[30-Sep-24 04:27 PM] igfloz#0000
.....and with a full 20 SME base, just smelting ALO, I figure you will need 1K ALO every 10 days (ish) ?


[30-Sep-24 04:28 PM] igfloz#0000
...with 5 experts I mean


[30-Sep-24 04:29 PM] saltymaggot#0000
With 5 experts it shows I need 353.10 per day.


[30-Sep-24 04:30 PM] igfloz#0000
ok, yeah, thats more than I guestimated, lol

[30-Sep-24 04:38 PM] evany.#0000
there are some 'meta' blueprints by the community that are commonly available, but others bling their ships too. its entirely up to you. you can also continue to change parts incrementally, the only thing of note that seems a bit unique is that while new components can always be equipped, they are destroyed when replaced- there is no 'unequip' button.

@doctorwhofr i see that you're planning on making a 20 BMP base on phobos. while i love the BMP plan, have you considered putting them on hephaestus instead?

hephaestus gets a +25% efficiency bonus from it's CoGC which improves your margins considerably. BMPs take a lot of PIO, which means a lot of consumables. you wanna get the most out of them


[07-Oct-24 10:21 AM] jvaler#0000
(CoGC = chamber of global commerce, found in a PLI buffer/tile)


[07-Oct-24 10:22 AM] laaxus#0000
What does he plan to produce ?


[07-Oct-24 10:23 AM] laaxus#0000
Because there's a ton of rep and pe already


[07-Oct-24 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
I unironically would recommend a fp base on hepha


[07-Oct-24 10:24 AM] jvaler#0000
well at that point why heph? just go norwick

[07-Oct-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd bet 2 starters can handle it


[07-Oct-24 10:25 AM] getonthetrain#0000
2 starters could certainly handle it


[07-Oct-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000

[07-Oct-24 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
But yes


[07-Oct-24 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I would either recommend a chemistry base on elon, or FP base on norwick


[07-Oct-24 10:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm planning to remove 10 BMP because they're too unprofitable


[07-Oct-24 10:27 AM] laaxus#0000

[07-Oct-24 10:27 AM] jvaler#0000
@doctorwhofr also, make sure to turn on luxury consumables and experts in prunplanner. assume 5 experts, because they're an eventuality as long as the base isn't demolished. (20 BMP are super fast at experts anyways)

you can if you want, but you'll probably find the reclaimed building's resources more useful. phobos sucks for new players because it's CoGC bonus is utterly useless to them

[07-Oct-24 10:33 AM] jvaler#0000
check to make sure your CM actually gives any reclaim though, it might not because it was constructed using a starter player CMK

just focus all future bases on the chamber of commerce bonus (25% production speed, which is huge)

I wouldn't be cutting up new bros like that.... It takes a while for most to come up to speed. It's a process. :/

But they did plop down a CM on Phobos without asking? If they're still in the first hour of that base, i think they can get the CM module back? Maybe.... It should convert to 100 units of MCG upon installation, so likely not.

I also started on Phobos because I didn't know anything about the COGC bonus


[07-Oct-24 10:43 AM] jvaler#0000
the bad onboarding experience is crutched by "just COLIQ if you mess up". i don't think it's healthy for the game :/

[07-Oct-24 10:43 AM] getonthetrain#0000
because I am not going to read a book before I start a game and see if I like it first


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i mean you dont even known


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
you need to read a book


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
xD


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you've got like an hour to check stuff out... I got really lucky by going with the "recommended" planets, in the starting buffer, since I wanted to become a Victualier, and so I chose Promitor.


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
I have choosen the starting planet i thing


[07-Oct-24 10:44 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i followed the tutorial


[07-Oct-24 10:45 AM] jvaler#0000
you don't have access to CoGC info from the starter screen, so it's not like the mistake is avoidable. just random chance if you got lucky with your choice


[07-Oct-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
do you have Pro?


[07-Oct-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
it's an tangent...


[07-Oct-24 10:45 AM] getonthetrain#0000
that's easy, I started as manufacturing and wanted to start in Antares just because it sounded less popular. Phobos was the only planet tagged as average for manufacturing

{Reactions}
😔 

[07-Oct-24 10:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But you're in-game, so you can take the time to look around, make up your mind, and potentially COLIQ to something that you will find better suits your interests.


[07-Oct-24 10:46 AM] getonthetrain#0000
what we are saying, is that shouldn't be necessary


[07-Oct-24 10:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
if your recipes have a good PPU, then it shouldn't matter.... Yes you'll lose the COGC bonus.... It's not like I don't do similar things either... Phobos is a FI planet for me.. Since the #free-real estate thing is getting rather hard once you get to my scale.

Leftovers from a bygone era... But they're all getting seriously upgraded to LCB STLs >:)

[07-Oct-24 10:50 AM] jvaler#0000
this was back before SCI or something?


[07-Oct-24 10:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah something like it... Malahat was barely gearing up for ENGs, not to mention SCIs, iirc.


[07-Oct-24 10:51 AM] jvaler#0000

i can't imagine... i really joined during a golden age lmao


[07-Oct-24 10:52 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Imagine... No FTL deals at all on UFO... there was only GTU. No ship parts on the CXs. No intermediary parts markets either.


[07-Oct-24 10:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
By the time the WCB upgrades made themselves available, I was age'd out, and had to go my own way.


[07-Oct-24 10:53 AM] jvaler#0000
what were the wait times like with GTU at the time?


[07-Oct-24 10:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[08-Oct-24 11:34 AM] superbadsounds#0000
Hello, everyone,

I am happy to submit this proposal for the ADI grant: A construction base on Antares III - Nike. 

https://prunplanner.org/shared/bbbbb49f-cb74-4e1c-9bc9-d869a93d3f90 (See attachment Antares Stage 1)

This plan will allow me to get a foothold in Antares space before I roll out another 4-5 bases over the coming weeks, and will eventually be upgraded to a full base like this:

https://prunplanner.org/shared/f1cb560d-b781-4c11-bb19-ddc92ff6dd23
 (See attachment Antares Stage 2) 
I'm already mostly self funded on this, but the grant will help me purchase the first 7 days of upkeep and production materials and manage the logistical costs of building a base outside of my starting sector in BEN.

I can't wait to hear your suggestions for how to make this base better and I'm looking forward to making a new home amongst you all!

Cheers,
superbadsounds

@superbadsounds I would build one less PP2 and PP3


[08-Oct-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
at first


[08-Oct-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
you need cash for input goods


[08-Oct-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
and usually, 1 day isn't enough


[08-Oct-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
you'll lack cash and it might put you in a tricky position

[08-Oct-24 01:06 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Heard, I appreciate the advice. Luckily, between the grant and my own $$, I've got enough funds on hand to cover a full week's materials. But if I need to save some cash, I'll certainly consider it!

[08-Oct-24 01:10 PM] jcheung#0000
I have a question


[08-Oct-24 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
How do you plan to support bases spaced this far apart?


[08-Oct-24 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Are you sending one of your starter ships to permanently be attached to ANT while the other services the 5 bases near BEN?


[08-Oct-24 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Even your partial design requires a visit every 4 days on average minimum with starters


[08-Oct-24 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
With a 1-2 day transit to your other bases, can you handle it?


[08-Oct-24 04:42 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Ive got the WCB upgrade on the ship I'm sending to be based in ANT.


[08-Oct-24 04:43 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I'll be utilizing that in the area long term


[09-Oct-24 12:04 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
just wonder


[09-Oct-24 12:04 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
does a base


[09-Oct-24 12:04 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
like my first base will cost me something if i move on to a new one ?


[09-Oct-24 12:05 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
like i am trying to make my plan for Hephaestus


[09-Oct-24 12:05 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
but my base at phobos will cost me something ? or just it will die free alone ?


[09-Oct-24 12:07 AM] laaxus#0000
Why not just upgrading hq and have 2 bases ?


[09-Oct-24 12:07 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
because everyone said that phobos is useless in my current state


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] laaxus#0000
It isn't wrong


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] laaxus#0000
You could demolish and move


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok but does the base will cost me something


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
if i dont destroy it


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
and just keep it for like "someday it will be usefull"


[09-Oct-24 12:08 AM] laaxus#0000
One hq expension


[09-Oct-24 12:09 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i can have only one hq expension?


[09-Oct-24 12:09 AM] laaxus#0000
No


[09-Oct-24 12:09 AM] finestone#0000
you can make RAT on phobos tho not ideal


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] finestone#0000
but can easily get you enough to get a 2nd base


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
my only point is "can i destroy my phobos base" moving out somehere else is not a real problem i didnt do mutch in phobos


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] finestone#0000
yes if you destroy the CM


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] finestone#0000
but i would keep the phobos base is my point


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
so keeping the phobos base


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] finestone#0000
just dont max it


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
what will be the cost


[09-Oct-24 12:10 AM] finestone#0000
go max another base first


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok i am keeping phobos base so


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
thx


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] finestone#0000
but 2 farm 2 FP 2 Rig can get you started on selling RATs


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
idk maybe someday i will made ELEC ^^' and so the 20% elec buff will be usefull


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] finestone#0000
exactly


[09-Oct-24 12:11 AM] finestone#0000
phobos has Fertility is my point


[09-Oct-24 12:12 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok so for me : 
- planning a base in Hephaestus 
- keeping phobos for future


[09-Oct-24 12:12 AM] finestone#0000
that is what i did!


[09-Oct-24 12:12 AM] finestone#0000
I maxxed 3 bases


[09-Oct-24 12:12 AM] finestone#0000
before starting building on phobos again


[09-Oct-24 12:13 AM] finestone#0000
at the end of the day its your choice tho


[09-Oct-24 12:13 AM] finestone#0000
you can abandon phobos by deleting CM


[09-Oct-24 12:13 AM] finestone#0000
Good luck!


[09-Oct-24 12:13 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
how many % of the CM i will get back ?


[09-Oct-24 12:13 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
if i delete it


[09-Oct-24 12:14 AM] finestone#0000
it will tell you under "Reclaimable materials"


[09-Oct-24 12:14 AM] finestone#0000
Since its your "free CM" i think you only get MCG back which is why its not reccomended to do so


[09-Oct-24 12:14 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok just last question


[09-Oct-24 12:14 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
for prunplanner


[09-Oct-24 12:15 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
the 20% equal to 5 experts ?


[09-Oct-24 12:15 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
on manufacturing for Hephaestus?

PrunPlanner already knows the COGC and would be applying the bonus already


[09-Oct-24 12:16 AM] finestone#0000
you can change it with the drop down but yeah you 20%+28.4%


[09-Oct-24 12:17 AM] finestone#0000
for COGC + Max Experts


[09-Oct-24 12:22 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
its really hard to make perfect base , because in fact my base at phobos make just 10k less then the project on Hephaestus ^^'

[09-Oct-24 12:25 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i think i will compensate the lost of LST by making an LST base close


[09-Oct-24 12:26 AM] realharvey#0000
Phobos is your only bases currently right?


[09-Oct-24 12:26 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
yes


[09-Oct-24 12:26 AM] realharvey#0000
If so you get a special module when you deconstruct your CM which gives you a special item to start a new base (a free CM)


[09-Oct-24 12:27 AM] realharvey#0000
So you'll save CM costs on a new planet


[09-Oct-24 12:27 AM] realharvey#0000
You could also use that special module to set a base up on Deimos. This special module is the only way to get on a planet that is full


[09-Oct-24 12:27 AM] realharvey#0000
Leaving it on Phobos is a total waste

You'll get a special CM


[09-Oct-24 12:34 AM] finestone#0000
that base is not possible due to 1100t import demand daily


[09-Oct-24 12:34 AM] finestone#0000
unless you are going to pay people to bring you LST with their ships which seems unreasonable and will eat into your profits

"1100t import demand daily"?


[09-Oct-24 12:46 AM] getonthetrain#0000
LST is heavy, that plan requires 1,100 tons of material imported per day


[09-Oct-24 12:46 AM] getonthetrain#0000
your two starter ships can hold 500 each

But even 13 BMP making MCG is better then making anything others even at 20 BMP rate

[09-Oct-24 12:52 AM] realharvey#0000
you can do tons of stuff in BMP


[09-Oct-24 12:52 AM] realharvey#0000
it makes sense to regulary check cx prices


[09-Oct-24 12:53 AM] realharvey#0000
other stuff gets more lucrative every now and then as prices shift


[09-Oct-24 12:53 AM] realharvey#0000
and that stuff will likely be not as heavy


[09-Oct-24 12:53 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Maybe grow RCO on Phobos, and weave it into COT on Heph?


[09-Oct-24 12:53 AM] getonthetrain#0000
I heard the #1 COT producer stopped completely


[09-Oct-24 12:54 AM] realharvey#0000
I highly recommend to stay away from an LST extraction base until you can reliably buy ships to carry that stuff. (A new ship costs 4-6 mil)


[09-Oct-24 12:55 AM] realharvey#0000
phobos has no agri COGC so you throw 25% efficiency out of the window. I recommend to avoid COGC sinning, especially in the beginning

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Oct-24 12:55 AM] getonthetrain#0000
lol, in the beginning is the only acceptable sin


[09-Oct-24 12:55 AM] getonthetrain#0000
later on you have money to efficiently place base on appropriate cogc with plenty of ships to work it out


[09-Oct-24 12:57 AM] realharvey#0000
building AGRI and FI stuff on one planet is an acceptable sin


[09-Oct-24 12:57 AM] realharvey#0000
but doing that on an Electronics planet is not

[09-Oct-24 01:00 AM] realharvey#0000
one build is COGC sinning on Phobos


[09-Oct-24 01:00 AM] realharvey#0000
and the other is reasonable Farming on harmonia


[09-Oct-24 01:01 AM] realharvey#0000
you are leaving 13k profit a day on the table for using phobos


[09-Oct-24 01:02 AM] getonthetrain#0000
leaving profit on the table is selling at the bid, what you have to do when you are new because you need cash flow


[09-Oct-24 01:03 AM] getonthetrain#0000
dude has Phobos and can get one more planet, you just gotta do what you gotta do when you are new


[09-Oct-24 01:04 AM] getonthetrain#0000
you build up, get cash, then fix the inefficiency because you can, because you then have cash


[09-Oct-24 01:04 AM] realharvey#0000
1 CM costs about 121k AIC. Why would he keep that on Phobos?


[09-Oct-24 01:04 AM] realharvey#0000
thats 121k AIC sitting doing nothing on Phobos because you cant reasonably use the COGC


[09-Oct-24 01:04 AM] realharvey#0000
putting that CM on Heph or Harmonia or Deimos is just in every way more efficient and costs them nothing


[09-Oct-24 01:06 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Just chalk it up as one of the things that doesn't get fixed in the game, having Phobos as a starter planet instead of Heph


[09-Oct-24 01:12 AM] finestone#0000
Very true, I just make sure things are possible and profitable not necessarily the most efficient

[09-Oct-24 01:20 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i can see also that norwick base for DW its not profitable anymore as the oogcapitalmanagement tutoriel


[09-Oct-24 01:22 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
BMP seem to be the simpliest and strongest base to make to start


[09-Oct-24 01:22 AM] realharvey#0000
its probably because the Price of Water has gotten up in the meantime. But thats already the first lesson learned. Any plan you make today will have a different outcome in the weeks to come


[09-Oct-24 01:23 AM] realharvey#0000
yes its very flexible. If one product is not viable anymore. There is tons of other options


[09-Oct-24 01:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
Based on everyone return


[09-Oct-24 01:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
And on my play style, i thing it will be 100% more productive to build an "low maintenance base"


[09-Oct-24 01:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
that will give a starting income

[09-Oct-24 01:41 AM] realharvey#0000
Flight time to frost is about 2 days. With 5 Days of storage you have a very tight window


[09-Oct-24 01:42 AM] realharvey#0000
cant go wrong with a full BMP base. But you should add 1 STO to it :)

you think i should stay on phobos ?


[09-Oct-24 06:18 AM] laaxus#0000
no

their is so mutch bases ^^'


[09-Oct-24 07:01 AM] realharvey#0000
All of these plans are great as well. But they are super reliant on inputs and don't offer much alternatives it there is a shortage


[09-Oct-24 07:05 AM] laaxus#0000
Same thing with full BMP, no ?


[09-Oct-24 07:23 AM] realharvey#0000
Not really. You have a lot of options:

[09-Oct-24 07:26 AM] realharvey#0000
Half a PP2 base on Aceland/Nike -> Almost everything dependend on AL prices.

FP base on norwick - Dependend on Agri products or Water (Not alot of Agri products hit the Market and Water is currently expensive)

Half a Pol base on elon - Dependend on C or CL which both have a tendency to spike quite a bit.

Chp base on elon - is more Expensive to build, havent looked in detail to be honest.

Inc base on nascent - dependend on Agri products


[09-Oct-24 07:27 AM] tanda#0000
More accurate list, lol

[09-Oct-24 07:27 AM] realharvey#0000
Everything has its advantages or disadvantages. I think BMP is more of a save bet when it comes to the first base


[09-Oct-24 07:28 AM] realharvey#0000
Your options are perfect expansions. Once you have your own agri Nascent and FP bases are great


[09-Oct-24 07:28 AM] realharvey#0000
before that I advise against it


[09-Oct-24 07:28 AM] realharvey#0000
Chemistry has good revenue, but C might bite ya unexpected


[09-Oct-24 07:30 AM] realharvey#0000
with a BMP: The market does not consume everything you produce? Switch recipe for a while until stuff sells out. 

Your input has a heavy spike? Oh I'll just start producing this instead then

EXO super expensive on the CX currently? I'll get into making it myself aswell then


[09-Oct-24 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000
currently nothing sell


[09-Oct-24 07:33 AM] laaxus#0000
it took a week to sell my rep stock


[09-Oct-24 07:33 AM] laaxus#0000
and let's not talk about pe


[09-Oct-24 07:33 AM] laaxus#0000
PT and MCG are probably best bet, but there's already a lot of supply of that


[09-Oct-24 07:33 AM] laaxus#0000

I literally just bought about 30k to supplement what I get from Okawari


[09-Oct-24 07:35 AM] realharvey#0000
I could also buy like 100k PE


[09-Oct-24 07:35 AM] realharvey#0000
for my LBH production


[09-Oct-24 07:35 AM] realharvey#0000
rep sells slow. That is right. The consumption speed of that is pretty minimal


[09-Oct-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, PE is not that profitable right now 
It had a ask price of like 8 for more than a week
Glad that it at least went back up from that


[09-Oct-24 07:44 AM] realharvey#0000
I was going to say that anything higher than 8 AIC per Unit is highway robbery, but man did production prices increase for it


[09-Oct-24 07:45 AM] realharvey#0000
if you have issues selling PE you can sell it to me


[09-Oct-24 08:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
how so? C is not cheap + H spiked


[09-Oct-24 08:22 AM] marat_sh#0000
lower then 8/u only worth in large quantities


[09-Oct-24 08:22 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am talking about 12k+ per day sales


[09-Oct-24 08:24 AM] marat_sh#0000
around 8.5-9.5 I think it's a sweet spot


[09-Oct-24 08:31 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
H2O prices underline your base commodity prices, which then reflect your eventual supply-based valuations on the markets. Without price-competition, you still have the same people dealing with pretty much the same metrics, be they through Prunplanner, or by hand-made excel.

First we had the AL crash. Then we had the RAT crash, and now the H2O crash. I wouldn't be surprised of all other other sectors started to re-evaluate their metrics... but who knows?


[09-Oct-24 09:06 AM] realharvey#0000
Last time I checked for PE a few months ago production costs of that have been quite a bit cheaper. Current price is actually fair like that


[09-Oct-24 09:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
Cost to make PE is around 6.61/u and selling it 8/u it's a ~21% margin. Cost to make PG is around 24.19/u and selling at 38/u it's ~57% margin


[09-Oct-24 09:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
so selling PE below 8 just doesn't make sense


[09-Oct-24 10:25 AM] jvaler#0000
@doctorwhofr okay so i wanna check up with you

what's your most recent plan like? have you diversified your recipe usage? going 100% into MCG isn't practical after all


[09-Oct-24 10:29 AM] realharvey#0000
I think we are having a misunderstanding. By saying *"I was going to say that anything higher than 8 AIC per Unit is highway robbery, but man did production prices increase for it"*  I was trying to say, that the price is currently fair when you look at the math but my gut feeling was its to pricey


[09-Oct-24 10:32 AM] razenpok#0000
*I remember 30 AIC/u H2O* :Cry2:


[09-Oct-24 10:33 AM] razenpok#0000

[09-Oct-24 11:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok


[09-Oct-24 11:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
what about REP


[09-Oct-24 11:30 AM] laaxus#0000
Fair price low volume


[09-Oct-24 11:30 AM] jvaler#0000
i like REP


[09-Oct-24 11:30 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
low volume, fair price, low storage for ship


[09-Oct-24 11:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Just so you know, I'm also producing rep


[09-Oct-24 11:31 AM] jvaler#0000
it's very easy on logistics, but the INS it takes can be quite expensive to get a buffer of


[09-Oct-24 11:31 AM] laaxus#0000
and I put a large ask order at 600


[09-Oct-24 11:31 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
so i am following the good path


[09-Oct-24 11:31 AM] laaxus#0000
no one undercut me, and even then it took more than a week to sell it


[09-Oct-24 11:32 AM] laaxus#0000
that's why you should always try to sell it imediatelly at bid price, so you can buy input good and keep producing


[09-Oct-24 11:32 AM] laaxus#0000
find the recipe that give you the best ROI with buying at ask, selling at bid


[09-Oct-24 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000
REP has a solid bid foundation on CXOB, but idk how profitable the recipe actually is at 500/u


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
very low


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
profitable, but low


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
22k profit a day


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] jvaler#0000
eesh


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
best recipe is MCG currently


[09-Oct-24 11:34 AM] laaxus#0000
~~with 77k profit per day~~


[09-Oct-24 11:35 AM] laaxus#0000
~~second one is PT, at 59k~~


[09-Oct-24 11:35 AM] tanda#0000
Speaking as the 6th top producer of Iodine, don't make Iodine. Almost all of it is made to be used internally


[09-Oct-24 11:35 AM] laaxus#0000
~~and rep, at 48k~~


[09-Oct-24 11:35 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
it's pretty good actually, with current prices.


[09-Oct-24 11:35 AM] jvaler#0000
PT is that good? hm... maybe i should lower my order lol

[09-Oct-24 11:36 AM] laaxus#0000
My price were not updated


[09-Oct-24 11:36 AM] jvaler#0000
oop


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
PT look cool but their is not a lot of demand


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
best recipe is MPCG at 53k per day
second one is PT at 51k
Rest is so low profit it's bad


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, with 20 bmp, you could fulfill the 3k demand in 5 days


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
your one real option is MCG


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
that's all


[09-Oct-24 11:37 AM] laaxus#0000
that's why I did not recommend BMP


[09-Oct-24 11:38 AM] jvaler#0000
PT's bid is much closer to the ask than REP's though. you'll get a better deal on it

[09-Oct-24 11:38 AM] jvaler#0000
😐 you diversify


[09-Oct-24 11:38 AM] jvaler#0000
you don't put all 20 BMP on 1 recipe


[09-Oct-24 11:38 AM] laaxus#0000
no recipe is profitable except mcg and pt


[09-Oct-24 11:39 AM] laaxus#0000
you can't diversify


[09-Oct-24 11:39 AM] laaxus#0000
PE price is so low it's almost producing at a loss


[09-Oct-24 11:39 AM] jvaler#0000
that's cause H is expensive rn


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] jvaler#0000
but bids are trash anyways... ofc everything looks bad


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
new players have to sell at bid buy at ask


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
they have to buy input goods


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
to keep producing


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] jvaler#0000
they don't have to


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] laaxus#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09-Oct-24 11:40 AM] jvaler#0000
and we're giving them 1mil AIC


[09-Oct-24 11:41 AM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, my point is


[09-Oct-24 11:41 AM] laaxus#0000
don't build BMP

{Reactions}
🚫 (2) 

[09-Oct-24 11:41 AM] laaxus#0000
build one of these


[09-Oct-24 11:41 AM] laaxus#0000
and you'll make profit


[09-Oct-24 11:42 AM] laaxus#0000
that's my advice


[09-Oct-24 11:42 AM] laaxus#0000
do what you want with it

[09-Oct-24 11:43 AM] jcheung#0000
BMP has plenty of profitable stuff other than I


[09-Oct-24 11:44 AM] realharvey#0000
Market is always shifting. A few weeks ago BMP is great. Now its worse. I see. But all this can happen to your other options aswell :D


[09-Oct-24 11:44 AM] realharvey#0000
vertical integration is key to long lasting profits

[09-Oct-24 11:44 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you haven't done the wikis/tutorials, production planning, then don't aim for Prunplanner ppu metrics.


[09-Oct-24 11:45 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, and I suspect it's getting worse because every single new adi member is building a BMP base, while there are other good options


[09-Oct-24 11:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I make my own MG, for PG production. I make my own I for MHL production. I'm not going to buy your stuff, ever.

😂 

[09-Oct-24 11:46 AM] realharvey#0000
but there is never enough AL in the market


[09-Oct-24 11:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
.... there is?


[09-Oct-24 11:46 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
you just might have opportunists who eat up everything before you can see it.


[09-Oct-24 11:46 AM] realharvey#0000
then there is not enough supply


[09-Oct-24 11:46 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
so what was the bad side of my H20 base ?  https://prunplanner.org/shared/34ea2d7a-b76e-49a3-adab-371563be180a

If I'd start buying my AL instead of making it myself the AL market will crash big time


[09-Oct-24 11:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd recommending making use of the internet requests/offers chat in here.


[09-Oct-24 11:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
h2o bases? lets see


[09-Oct-24 11:47 AM] realharvey#0000
the two day flight to ANT


[09-Oct-24 11:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You're at Frost...


[09-Oct-24 11:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
or you want to be.


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok but what is important in that distance


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
like i can just stock it ?


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a solid resource there. Meaning that you'll get 2/3 of the potential output, if you were to drop on a Liquid, and equivalent deposit elsewhere.


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
you'll produce more than you can ship, that's the issue


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
stock is not what matters


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
shipping is a resource


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That too.


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
its say 297.67t


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Are you a starter?


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
ship are **expensive** a new ship is 4 to 6M AIC


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
100% starter


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
why i need more ship ?


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
so you must include shipping in your profitability


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
i already got two ?


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
won't be enough for long


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You have x2 SCB FTLs available to you. Per those base metrics, you will be need to ship ever 2 days....


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] laaxus#0000
especially if you take bases far away


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
2 day trip to-from ANT.. .Meaning you will be stuck there, until you can buy another LCB ship.


[09-Oct-24 11:49 AM] realharvey#0000
Your export frequenzy is 1,68 which means that you need to fly alot

[09-Oct-24 11:50 AM] realharvey#0000
it takes your ship 2 days from there to ant. and 2 days back


[09-Oct-24 11:50 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
where do you see this ?


[09-Oct-24 11:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lol....


[09-Oct-24 11:50 AM] laaxus#0000
to give you another point of view, I have 2  3000m3 1000t ship.
One of my base requires one back and forth a week.

Compare that with your base

[09-Oct-24 11:51 AM] realharvey#0000
Ships are expensive. When you bind all your ships you cant expand until you get another one


[09-Oct-24 11:51 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
for the BMP base


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
what does this mean


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] realharvey#0000
which products?


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
MCG


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] realharvey#0000
with your starter ships you'd have to export twice a day


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] realharvey#0000
MCG is to heavy for you


[09-Oct-24 11:52 AM] realharvey#0000
or atleast the full base dedicated to it


[09-Oct-24 11:53 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
just i need to understand


[09-Oct-24 11:53 AM] doctorwhofr#0000

[09-Oct-24 11:53 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
that is a full BMP MCG x20 base

[09-Oct-24 11:54 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
like why 1000 have more visitation frequency ^'


[09-Oct-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
You have a 500 500 ship do first line


[09-Oct-24 11:54 AM] realharvey#0000
You are reading it wrong


[09-Oct-24 11:54 AM] laaxus#0000
This means you would have to do 2 back and forth for inport and export


[09-Oct-24 11:55 AM] laaxus#0000
0.63 are days


[09-Oct-24 11:55 AM] realharvey#0000
if it says: "0,63" it means you have to visit it about twice a day. If it would say "7" you would have to export once a week


[09-Oct-24 11:55 AM] laaxus#0000
So one back and forth every 0.42 days, which is 2.5 Time per day


[09-Oct-24 11:55 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
and of course this is a bad things ?


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Ships are a ressource


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok so its like how many frequently


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
my ship


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
will be used


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
to do this all things


[09-Oct-24 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
When you'll want to expand, you'll need ships to supply that New base


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
like if i had a 1000/3000 ship it will be possible to go export and import


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@laaxus if you're geting nowhere with your explanations, then give them 1-2 weeks to figure it out, on their own.


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
only every 2 days


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] jcheung#0000
higher is better


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, I'm tired


[09-Oct-24 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
They'll learn


[09-Oct-24 11:58 AM] laaxus#0000
Or I'm wrong


[09-Oct-24 11:58 AM] laaxus#0000
In any case I tried


[09-Oct-24 11:58 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
sorry to ask question


[09-Oct-24 11:58 AM] doctorwhofr#0000
have a good day all


[09-Oct-24 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Was not talking about you


[09-Oct-24 11:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Newbros don't usually experience shipping issues, until they do start to expand, and incurr "issues", and then ask for help somewhere else.


[09-Oct-24 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Maybe I'm Bad at explaining things, that's a possibility too


[09-Oct-24 12:00 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
hum


[09-Oct-24 12:00 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
if i understand you


[09-Oct-24 12:00 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
my H2O base


[09-Oct-24 12:00 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
is so better then the MCG one ^^'

[09-Oct-24 12:00 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
its only every 1,6 day and only use 1 ship


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
keep in mind travel time


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
OOOOOH


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
OF COURSE


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
2day


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
of travel


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
yeh sorry


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Build 25% of that planned base, then let us know how it works out.


[09-Oct-24 12:01 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
make sense now


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
for my 500/500 I don't do more then 500/500 import export Since that would mean I need to send ship 24/7


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
and burn more fuel to be in time


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
See, it all eventually clicks.


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
and only 1 day of ship travel i suppose ?


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
because H2O is actually an less 500/500 import

[09-Oct-24 12:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah so if it takes 40h for round trip I go for 250/250 import export


[09-Oct-24 12:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's easier with better cargo but for now in general try to not go over 500t/500m3 on export import per day


[09-Oct-24 12:04 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok thx for that all advice


[09-Oct-24 12:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
as for BMPs they are fine right now but you need to mix items


[09-Oct-24 12:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
I do MCG/REP/EXO/PE


[09-Oct-24 12:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
they used to be amazing but more people got into them so prices dropped


[09-Oct-24 12:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
but they still make money


[09-Oct-24 12:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
just not as much as they used to


[09-Oct-24 12:06 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
just to understand with the shipping part


[09-Oct-24 12:06 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
Export Frequency


[09-Oct-24 12:06 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
its link to storage size ?


[09-Oct-24 12:07 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
like why i can just stock H2O and sell it in batch ?


[09-Oct-24 12:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
your CM gives you 1500/1500 storage... It's enough for begining but later you would want to add 1 STO (it will make storage 6500/6500)


[09-Oct-24 12:07 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
1500


[09-Oct-24 12:07 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
thx


[09-Oct-24 12:07 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
make more sense


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
making 1k a day of H2O


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
of course i need to sell it


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok make sense


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] tanda#0000
Why not do the H2O base at Ice Station Alpha?


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
its 2 day to ^^'


[09-Oct-24 12:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
where is your H20 production? I am confused I thought you are doing BMPs


[09-Oct-24 12:09 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
no its just because their is so mutch fight about BMP


[09-Oct-24 12:09 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
that i started to plan another thing to test ^^'

*note, above image is not of your base


[09-Oct-24 12:10 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
yes but make sense thankls


[09-Oct-24 12:10 PM] jcheung#0000
for shipping take lower of the two frequencies


[09-Oct-24 12:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If one wishes to march, to the sound of their own drum,
Let them go through, those yearning fires and flame;
But should they recant, and seek another to blame,
Of them I shall readily make, thoroughly numb.

Geez, that was 17 years ago. I'm f'ing old.


[09-Oct-24 12:12 PM] jcheung#0000
or, hear me out, let the people who have more patience, or different styles take over 😉


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
All are welcome? XD


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
so H2O its dump idea


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
^^'


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
ok


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well... It's good, you just need to grow a little bit more, before you can do it 24/7.


[09-Oct-24 12:13 PM] laaxus#0000

But you don't have the money for yhat


[09-Oct-24 12:14 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
but BMP bases are also hard to manage


[09-Oct-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
sure there is. rent your permits to someone else

1191t per day on import


[09-Oct-24 12:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
bad


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
so then do a mix of buildings


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
1191t > 500


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
do like


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
PPF


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
PPF items don't sell


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm.....


[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A PE base could be good?

[09-Oct-24 12:15 PM] laaxus#0000
Yes but it's  not a lot of money
Tho it's a very good Idea 
If you like the Idea of guaranted 44k day profit with low shipping, without needed to fund the base, contact riseoffilth

[09-Oct-24 12:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They don't sell well since they're all shipbuilding stuff.


[09-Oct-24 12:16 PM] jcheung#0000
tbh closer to 30k


[09-Oct-24 12:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
I can fill first two BIDs in few hours


[09-Oct-24 12:16 PM] laaxus#0000
Riseoffilth offers 44k


[09-Oct-24 12:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Maybe, you'll get a little bit of sales from CMs from new expansions... But they totally undershoot production capacities.


[09-Oct-24 12:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
WPLs are better for market then PPF


[09-Oct-24 12:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
PPF is too verticaly integrated


[09-Oct-24 12:17 PM] jcheung#0000
i have 3 bases with him. it's a lot closer to 30k.


[09-Oct-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, but harder to get started


[09-Oct-24 12:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
currect


[09-Oct-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
at 2k PSL a week, you would need around 50 PPFs to make 5% of the consumption, assuming that 2k is standard


[09-Oct-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
it also regularly sells at ASK


[09-Oct-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
though you'll probably sell in batches of 12


[09-Oct-24 12:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
I can make ~43 PSL per day


[09-Oct-24 12:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's 2093/u to make


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't have my own PG production so PG price is from CX


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] jcheung#0000
that's what like 20 PPFs?


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] jcheung#0000
ish?


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
16 right now


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
5 experts


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
+ 16 BMPs


[09-Oct-24 12:22 PM] jcheung#0000
right, so like.... an entire base full of PPFs might make a dent in things, but your base is what i'm suggesting...


[09-Oct-24 12:22 PM] jcheung#0000
lightweight materials mixed with heavy


[09-Oct-24 12:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeap that's my 2 permit Heph base right now

[09-Oct-24 12:32 PM] doctorwhofr#0000
and all other advice


[09-Oct-24 12:51 PM] realharvey#0000
I have one with 47k hmm. I think only heph wpl was only a 30k deal because it was/is superlow maintenance rofllolbase


[09-Oct-24 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
47k after factoring in workforce cost?


[09-Oct-24 12:52 PM] realharvey#0000
yup


[09-Oct-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
I have one at 44k/day


[09-Oct-24 12:53 PM] realharvey#0000
I do get most workforce stuff even cheaper so its actually higher


[09-Oct-24 12:54 PM] realharvey#0000
even if not. A not think about it 3 base a 30k boost is super nice per day to grow


[09-Oct-24 12:55 PM] jcheung#0000
interesting. i have one base that does 20-22k/d after costs, one at 35k/d, one at 44k/d, so i guess i average slightly over 30/d/b


[09-Oct-24 12:55 PM] realharvey#0000
which one is only 20-22k a day? o.O


[09-Oct-24 12:55 PM] jcheung#0000
BRM


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] laaxus#0000
you're getting ripped off my dude


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] laaxus#0000
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] jcheung#0000
no i'm not


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] laaxus#0000
if you say so


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] jcheung#0000
i wouldn't have a base making income otherwise


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] jcheung#0000
between zero and 20,000 i'll take 20,000


[09-Oct-24 12:56 PM] realharvey#0000
did you talk to him about that?


[09-Oct-24 12:57 PM] jcheung#0000
no, because of what i said earlier-it's better than 0. and i have permits open right now, so i'm not hurting


[09-Oct-24 12:58 PM] jcheung#0000
and an average of 30k/d is perfectly fine by me

Things will change when you get your hands on new ships, and more capital.


[09-Oct-24 01:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
:3


[09-Oct-24 01:01 PM] jcheung#0000
and then i renegotiate at that point. i figure for what he's done for me that base can stay for at least 6 months without me complaining about it


[09-Oct-24 01:02 PM] realharvey#0000
I was just very suprised about it


[09-Oct-24 01:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
maaan... in 6 months I can afford 3 and more bases to build myself


[09-Oct-24 01:03 PM] realharvey#0000
or in 2 days when you get a loan


[09-Oct-24 01:03 PM] jcheung#0000
i have 4 permit slots open that i'm just waiting for funds to fill 😛 need to cool it on my loans though


[09-Oct-24 01:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't build bases at full permits


[09-Oct-24 01:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
maybe like 1/3 of permit first


[09-Oct-24 01:04 PM] jcheung#0000
all mine are 1 permit


[09-Oct-24 01:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
and slowly build it with funds it's making


[09-Oct-24 01:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
I mean like 100-200 area


[09-Oct-24 01:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
not full 500 area


[09-Oct-24 01:04 PM] realharvey#0000
isnt it quite a chore to always to back to that baseplan to add another building to it?


[09-Oct-24 01:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
Not really, I mean I am new so I only have 2 bases


[09-Oct-24 01:05 PM] realharvey#0000
I've been procastinating rebuilding my nova honshu base to full WPL for quite a while due to that lol


[09-Oct-24 01:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
barely any logistics


[09-Oct-24 01:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am doing once a week Before pop report


[09-Oct-24 01:06 PM] realharvey#0000
You are playing without loans right?


[09-Oct-24 01:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeap


[09-Oct-24 01:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
only 750k when started


[09-Oct-24 01:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
~6 mil in equity


[09-Oct-24 01:07 PM] realharvey#0000
do you want to top it off to 1 mil like the others are getting now?


[09-Oct-24 01:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
I didn't need it


[09-Oct-24 01:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
750 was enough


[09-Oct-24 01:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
everything else from sales


[09-Oct-24 01:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have 1 mil on cash righ now


[09-Oct-24 01:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
so I can potentially subsidize as well 😅


[09-Oct-24 01:08 PM] realharvey#0000
nah you shouldn't :)


[09-Oct-24 01:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
"potentially" 😅


[09-Oct-24 01:08 PM] igfloz#0000
You'll need that 1 Mill once repairs come around


[09-Oct-24 01:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
I demolish old buildings


[09-Oct-24 01:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
and place them on new base


[09-Oct-24 01:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
like I did with BMPs

[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] marat_sh#0000
this one will be relocated to my new base on Nike


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] realharvey#0000
as a BMP?


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeap


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] jcheung#0000
wait


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] marat_sh#0000
to make MCGs


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] realharvey#0000
🙈


[09-Oct-24 01:10 PM] jcheung#0000

[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] marat_sh#0000

[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
like what?


[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
SCA/MCA


[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
I still get 10% from Corp HQ there


[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
have you considered astraeus?


[09-Oct-24 01:11 PM] realharvey#0000
MCG Needs LST which extracs okayish on Nike


[09-Oct-24 01:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeap Exactly the reason why


[09-Oct-24 01:12 PM] realharvey#0000
but BMP and EXT are not the COGC of nike. Which makes me go *GGRRRR*


[09-Oct-24 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
they're not as big as a WPL but they're twice the size of BMPs so you wouldn't be hit that hard for the special needs


[09-Oct-24 01:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
I take Green planets over COGC any time


[09-Oct-24 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
#priorities


[09-Oct-24 01:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
min maxing COGC is for later Right now I just need cash flow


[09-Oct-24 01:15 PM] realharvey#0000
ignoring 25% COGC reduces your cashflow


[09-Oct-24 01:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well You see, I am a manufacturing only


[09-Oct-24 01:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
since there is only 5 Manufacturing COGCs


[09-Oct-24 01:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have to improvise


[09-Oct-24 01:17 PM] laaxus#0000
I respect that


[09-Oct-24 01:17 PM] igfloz#0000
I mean, I can see the reasoning. If your looking for the corp HQ bonus vs personal HQ bonus, I kinda get it - it still feels wrong to me, but I kinda get your reasoning


[09-Oct-24 01:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
Like I want to have some BMPs but since I have other plans for these 5 Manufacturing planets I need to put those BMPs somewhere else


[09-Oct-24 01:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
and that would be Corp HQ


[09-Oct-24 02:34 PM] evov#0000
I'm thinking about closing one of my PPF planets (and a connected POL planet that makes PG for it) So I've got 2 permits to put towards my next project. The supply side of PSM/PSL etc is low enough that I'm a little concerned about doing it as I can't afford to run out of those materials.


[09-Oct-24 02:36 PM] evov#0000
So if anyone is interested in making a PPF Base, hit me up, I might be able to offer long term consistent buy's... and if it's on a planet I'm already on, maybe take delivery on that planet so you don't need to worry about shipping back to the CX. Makes for a very low logistics requirement base.


[09-Oct-24 02:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
That was my plan I am getting my PPF productions for corp first then more for market


[09-Oct-24 02:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
It will take a bit


[09-Oct-24 02:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
but we will get there


[09-Oct-24 02:39 PM] evov#0000
On average - they're not super high margin (though they do spike from time to time)  - but.... they're low tier work force, and importantly, very low on logistics needs. So it makes it a fairly cheap base for newer players to dedicate a permit to.


[09-Oct-24 02:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
constant sales help with lower margins


[09-Oct-24 02:54 PM] evov#0000
I made a public offer to all the new players on Deimos to buy their metals output directly on Deimos. Only 1 person took advantage of that offer. Every time they get 100 AL produced on planet, I get a contract show up and they get cash. I also offered similar things where I'd provide and deliver all the inputs for something, and buy the output. So it functions like a short term loan and covers 90% of the logistics need for that process. - Again, only 1 person ever took me up on that offer.

I think in general, people are unaware of how much $ they have tied up in product that they're waiting to sell.

I don't use my sme to produce AL


[09-Oct-24 02:56 PM] laaxus#0000
it's not profitable enough


[09-Oct-24 02:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
AL at 786/u right now


[09-Oct-24 02:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
I thinks it's not that bad


[09-Oct-24 02:57 PM] laaxus#0000
nah

Hortus has AL cheaper 💀


[09-Oct-24 02:58 PM] laaxus#0000
rightn ow, it's producing si, for my own consumption


[09-Oct-24 02:58 PM] laaxus#0000
46k per day, is not enough for me


[09-Oct-24 02:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
👍


[09-Oct-24 03:00 PM] evov#0000
I think from memory - the person that's taken me up on the offer sells me AL, and LI regularly.. and is currently working through a KV order, that I paid for in advance and provided all the inputs needed. I suspect the cash forward for that KV funded most of their 2nd base.


[09-Oct-24 03:59 PM] realharvey#0000
around 50k per Permit is what I guess is everything going down to once production and demand meet on a product


[09-Oct-24 04:00 PM] realharvey#0000
higher tier goods will hit higher levels


[09-Oct-24 04:00 PM] realharvey#0000
anything that has higher profit per permit will eventually also go down


[09-Oct-24 04:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
I noticed it's 40-50k for T1 and 50-70k for T2


[09-Oct-24 04:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
T3+ are vertically integrated or have overpriced items


[09-Oct-24 04:02 PM] realharvey#0000
a good old POL base making was raking in 120k profit per day when I started half a year ago


[09-Oct-24 04:02 PM] realharvey#0000
now it came down to 66k

I got an invite to a corp „Galactic Trading Commission“ with 1k shares á 5k NCC. What is that? That feels scammy. 🤣 is there a chance to join an Antares-based corp?


[10-Oct-24 06:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
shares are based on amount of players


[10-Oct-24 06:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
1k per player


[10-Oct-24 06:48 AM] marat_sh#0000

You can drop FE / STL until you deplete Li BIDs


[10-Oct-24 08:49 AM] mancules#0000
Morning guys, I've been working through some plans for how to approach my first base, and I think the planner @marat_sh shared with me, and above, would be a good start to get going. While it isn't original would that qualify for a grant? The ROI is roughly 2 weeks which is pretty good. I want to participate in the Gateway Coop long term, so I'd reinvest down the road into ways to help. Currently, I'm still learning all the different materials in the game and the production lines. As it stands aiding the gateway project right now, I'm considering going into vortex fuel production long term once the update comes out, but in the meantime I'd just do my part assisting with other materials and preparing to set that up when the updates goes live. I don't know how practical that given I haven't seen a time line for when it would happen, but it's a long term plan nonetheless. Any thoughts?


[10-Oct-24 08:50 AM] laaxus#0000
Gateway cost a shit ton, for now focus on growth


[10-Oct-24 08:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
Gateway projects are for people who don't know what to do with their money... Get your bases up and running first


[10-Oct-24 08:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
gateway project is more of a charity right now


[10-Oct-24 08:51 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend to look at every base I recommended in the pinned post, and put them in prunplanner.

You'd see many possibility and learn many things

SME are not the only possibility for a good starter base !


[10-Oct-24 08:52 AM] marat_sh#0000
You producing stuff in ANT helps GDP growth -> Increasing funds in the sector -> more possibilities and trade


[10-Oct-24 08:52 AM] mancules#0000
Understandable, I've noticed a few products that are in limited supply at the Antares Station, would a good longer term strategy for me be working on building up to production lines for those? Or should I just be dabbling base setups that are profitable similar to the SME base I'd build first?


[10-Oct-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
So focus on the stuff you can sell right now "BIDs" see how fast you can fill them up and are they long term


[10-Oct-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
for other items like CF


[10-Oct-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
Ask people here


[10-Oct-24 08:53 AM] mancules#0000
Will do! I did take a look through there, but was leaning towards the SME since I'm currently located on Deimos which is just O2, ALO, and H20


[10-Oct-24 08:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
many will buy them through the contracts


[10-Oct-24 08:54 AM] mancules#0000
So, in my case since what I currently have is AL production lines, focus on filling out those BIDs just for that is what you're saying?


[10-Oct-24 08:55 AM] marat_sh#0000
yeap


[10-Oct-24 08:55 AM] marat_sh#0000
split 50/50 to put in ASK and sell the rest to BID


[10-Oct-24 08:55 AM] marat_sh#0000
you will get your cash and you will earn more through ASK


[10-Oct-24 08:57 AM] marat_sh#0000

[10-Oct-24 08:59 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeap get your SME base up and running save some cash Make sure you will have inputs for a week or two


[10-Oct-24 08:59 AM] marat_sh#0000
then you can start thinking about second base


[10-Oct-24 09:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
if you are not a "one category only" supremacist... Chemistry always has a demand


[10-Oct-24 09:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
look into that as well


[10-Oct-24 09:08 AM] mancules#0000
Will do, I'm gonna stick with AL production and the SMEs for the time being, I've got just enough cash to build another EXT and SME so I'm going to do that and I'll see if there's anything I can move into on the chemistry front once I have a bit more money lying around

The starting-in-antares site is a nice read and just assures me that a Promitor - Farms are not mandatory at all. Tbh, i dont get half of the other pin-post... whats a "half a pp2" base? I'm kinda lost there. 😄 i took a dive into AL now and i think i'll stay there. it seems at least reasonable profitable for now, even without the 10% HQ bonus. What is "Hephaestos - Other BMP", tho? Seems mad profitable at 100k...


[10-Oct-24 09:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
used to be if you mix in EXO / REP / MCG you get higher profits then just PE


[10-Oct-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
now that EXO and REP prices dropped You can't get number anymore


[10-Oct-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's still good thing to mix in some more profitable items that sell


[10-Oct-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
just keep in mind to not overproduce daily buys


[10-Oct-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
or prices will drop again


[10-Oct-24 09:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
BMP recepies used to be one of the best (a few months ago) now they are average or below average


[10-Oct-24 09:48 AM] laaxus#0000
prices and profits are not updated **BE CAREFUL**


[10-Oct-24 09:48 AM] laaxus#0000
always check the current profit by putting the plan into prunplanner


[10-Oct-24 09:48 AM] laaxus#0000
BMP are definitly below average right now


[10-Oct-24 09:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I would chose any of my recomendations (in the pinned post) over a bmp base if I were to start again


[10-Oct-24 10:46 AM] cuendilar#0000
I'm sure those are good suggestions, but for a new player it is hard to decipher. i get the "incinerators on nascent" and thats basically what i will do as 2nd base, but for the rest... i have no idea what those mean. 😄 sorry. Also, i'm kinda invested into the idea to be an aluminium-farmer on Deimos for 1st base. 🙂


[10-Oct-24 10:48 AM] tanda#0000
And that's fair to feel that way. Profits are decent enough, and your product will always sell


[10-Oct-24 10:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
90% of the time you will make money... the catch is how fast

When is it a good idea to get a new permit? I planned out a TRU base that looks really good and there's a lot more demand than supply at Anatares Station, but is it a good idea to increase land size and just keep increasing it or is it better off to leave it as is and move onto the next base


[10-Oct-24 11:11 AM] mancules#0000
Also, I know this channel is listed for the grant program, but does it double as a "help/questions" area or should I be posting else where


[10-Oct-24 11:13 AM] cuendilar#0000
I for one are ruthlessly using it as a help/questions substitute. 🤣


[10-Oct-24 11:13 AM] tanda#0000
It's a good idea to get a new permit when you can afford to build and supply the new base. There's nothing wrong with dropping partials and building up over time, though


[10-Oct-24 11:14 AM] tanda#0000
However one of the main questions you should be asking yourself this early is "can I ship it?"


[10-Oct-24 11:14 AM] tanda#0000
I think that TRU base is not going to be an easy shipping base, since it's heavy in and bulky out


[10-Oct-24 11:26 AM] mancules#0000
Thanks! I have been keeping an eye on shipping weights and volume, but maybe I'm interpreting them wrong, but if I'm not the current output for the 1 permit base I have planned is 270m^3 and 18tons, within my current ships cargo capacity. Does the cargo effect time to travel and fuel usage? I could see that then coming around to give me some issues down the road, and if it does is there a tool I can use to estimate it?

I also missed the delta m^3 in the snips, for the TRU its 270


[10-Oct-24 11:41 AM] tanda#0000
That's less than I thought. Hmm, I guess I just perceived TRU being bigger than it is.  
Iirc you will not notice a slowdown on starter ships due to weight

Another question, I've seen people advertise loans, is that generally a bad idea in game? It seems tempting but ideally not getting taken advantage as a newer player is probably a good idea

they're not bad if you're responsible

It's a great community so you don't really need to worry about lenders at all. Loans are great if you're feeling comfortable in your setup and are ready to speed up expansion a bit

Source: built the first 90% of my 14 base empire on just loans, lol


[10-Oct-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
anyways, generally speaking for loans themselves as the lendee, you assume very little risk-if you're merely late and not doing a take-the-money-and-run deal, most lenders will happily extend the loan

[10-Oct-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
do it too often and obviously that person might not loan to you anymore, but most are forgiving


[10-Oct-24 11:48 AM] mancules#0000
Word, so typically its a pay back by date and not a weekly (or whenever) fee. I gotta assume there's interest as well


[10-Oct-24 11:49 AM] jcheung#0000
there's a few different loan types


[10-Oct-24 11:49 AM] jcheung#0000
one is interest only. get the money, pay interest each period (usually each week) and at the end you pay back all the money and a little more interest


[10-Oct-24 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
this one is great for starting out, but you have to be careful near the end


[10-Oct-24 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
another is stable, you take the original fund, divide by number of periods (based on repayment %), you pay that each period plus interest which decreases each period


[10-Oct-24 11:52 AM] jcheung#0000
the last, least used one is annuity. it has some benefit in that it flattens out your payment so you always pay the same amount, but it typically is not used due to higher complexity


[10-Oct-24 11:53 AM] jcheung#0000
with it though, given the right range you can lower your payments at the start compared to stable, but you may also end up paying more interest.... or less. depends on the parameters a lot


[10-Oct-24 11:55 AM] mancules#0000
Gotcha, thank you for the write up, definitely helps open up how I can expand then


[10-Oct-24 11:57 AM] mancules#0000
The TRU base I planned out profits 53k with a ROI of 15 days, but it would cost me roughly 600k, excluding upstart material costs, to max out the area, might consider shrinking it and starting smaller so I wouldn't be looking a near million credit loan


[10-Oct-24 11:57 AM] jcheung#0000
have you already used the AGP grant or are you trying to apply for it?


[10-Oct-24 11:58 AM] jcheung#0000
because as a grant, there is no repayment

[10-Oct-24 11:59 AM] mancules#0000

Understood, sounds easy enough! Since that's the case here's my current build for the TRU base https://prunplanner.org/shared/8089700a-e4ec-43f1-9270-611088b3dbd6
I'm on Deimos and I'm still digging around with ways to further refine the AL to see if there's any way I can increase profits. My plan for this base is to stick to using the AL though since I can mine it and smelt it myself. I haven't run a planner that is only WEL making the TRU yet though, because I'm limited on transport and don't want to worry about the need for constant micromanagement if I can avoid it, welcome to any suggestions

building it on deimos itself?


[10-Oct-24 12:09 PM] mancules#0000
Yes, that's where I started and haven't thought about branching off yet


[10-Oct-24 12:09 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so two things.
1) i recommend you use the last 15 space on a STO


[10-Oct-24 12:10 PM] jcheung#0000
2) WEL doesn't match the COGC of deimos, which gives a significant boost to metallurgy (SME, for example)
now, i have stuff on deimos that doesn't match either but i just want to make you aware of that


[10-Oct-24 12:11 PM] jcheung#0000
you can always move the WEL in like 90 days when the repair cycle comes up without much loss


[10-Oct-24 12:13 PM] mancules#0000
Oh that's good to know, wouldn't be a bad idea to move it to another base down the road and move this one back to a strictly metallurgy focus


[10-Oct-24 12:13 PM] jcheung#0000
(repairs are usually just before 60 or 90 days)


[10-Oct-24 12:14 PM] mancules#0000
I did have one plan that was all SME making a few things like FE, AL, STL, the profit came out to roughly the same but I liked that this plan felt I was moving in on a market that needed more supply


[10-Oct-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
another thing, TRU doesn't trade very fast on the CX from what i can tell


[10-Oct-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
wait, i'm way wrong


[10-Oct-24 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
sorry


[10-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
3.5k traded last week isn't bad, i was going off bad memory


[10-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
that said, you would theoretically make 1.2k per week


[10-Oct-24 12:15 PM] jcheung#0000
so you WILL saturate the market quickly


[10-Oct-24 12:16 PM] jcheung#0000
also for FE, that stuff is really heavy


[10-Oct-24 12:17 PM] mancules#0000
That's a good point, 1/3 of the total trades added in would probably hurt the bottom line or at the very least slow down sales


[10-Oct-24 12:17 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have the price low enough i'm sure you can sell out for sure


[10-Oct-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
don't forget to add in shipping costs though


[10-Oct-24 12:18 PM] mancules#0000
This was another reason I was looking for some alternatives, looked like maintaining my supplies and selling stuff would become burdensome


[10-Oct-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
tbh selling the raw AL isn't a bad option either


[10-Oct-24 12:19 PM] mancules#0000
How is this viewed in this community, I wouldn't want to tank the market by dramatically increasing the supply


[10-Oct-24 12:19 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh, I doubt you'd tank it


[10-Oct-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
someone buys it all and then relists it at a higher price 😛

then they do this a few more times until they realize you're there to stay, and then get annoyed


[10-Oct-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
that said WELs have other things they can make so more likely is other people will just shift to other stuff


[10-Oct-24 12:21 PM] mancules#0000
Gotcha alright


[10-Oct-24 12:21 PM] mancules#0000
I took a look at an all ALO base, better ROI with similar daily profits but moving it would add up, two trips a day at least for my current ships


[10-Oct-24 12:22 PM] jcheung#0000
if you're willing to export though, TRU sells for just under double on the other side of the galaxy


[10-Oct-24 12:22 PM] jcheung#0000
that being said, i think it's about to lower in price over there


[10-Oct-24 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
painful thing about TRU is that they're a volume heavy item


[10-Oct-24 12:23 PM] mancules#0000
What are the logistics of that, would I be able to realistically do that now with the two starter ships?


[10-Oct-24 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
eh. if deimos is your only base?


[10-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
with that plan


[10-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
yes


[10-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
BUT


[10-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
you're not shipping everything up to MOR consistently


[10-Oct-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
also round trip will be like 4 days or more


[10-Oct-24 12:26 PM] mancules#0000
Oh ya then I'd for sure need a few more ships to keep up with production otherwise I'd be sitting on way too many


[10-Oct-24 12:27 PM] mancules#0000
I look forward to breaking into other markets, but I think I'll stick to Antares for the time being


[10-Oct-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
if you end up making TRU though, let me know. i send a ship up to MOR once or twice a month... though it won't be able to hold a *ton*


[10-Oct-24 12:31 PM] mancules#0000
Will do! That's what I'm leaning towards but it'll be a bit before it's up and running


[10-Oct-24 12:32 PM] tanda#0000
Regarding FE, SFK is really lightly populated at the moment. Need about 2-3 more FS worth of supply

[10-Oct-24 04:00 PM] mancules#0000
Been doing some more research into the TRU base idea and took a look at the historical prices, could anyone be able to help me understand why the price has dropped so much over two months even though the listed supply is only half the listed demand? Maybe I'm interpreting the supply/demand incorrectly, but the looks of the prices doesn't make me feel like the TRU base would be good if I can expect the price to further fall

[10-Oct-24 04:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Price spiked so everyone switched back to making it from MHL or similar products made in WEL


[10-Oct-24 04:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
From my understanding that is


[10-Oct-24 04:02 PM] mancules#0000
Makes sense, what would cause a price spike in PrUn, speculation on upcoming patches?


[10-Oct-24 04:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
People stopped making TRU to make MHL


[10-Oct-24 04:03 PM] igfloz#0000
or need. A spike in HQ upgrades (for a few people) - look at the grey volumes from left to right, more have bought more recently....... I guess that will fall back and stabilise


[10-Oct-24 04:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
keep in mind that the supply / demand numbers you're looking at are just the # of bids and asks


[10-Oct-24 04:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
it might be more informative to look at the daily volume to get an idea of how much you could realistically sell


[10-Oct-24 04:05 PM] igfloz#0000
many people picka product and "give" it a value. They will never buy if it is on the CX for +10 of their purchase price


[10-Oct-24 04:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
(idk if someone mentioned that before, just wanted to bring it up 🙂 )


[10-Oct-24 04:05 PM] mancules#0000
So when looking into markets that I might want to set my first base up for, daily traded would be a better number to look at?


[10-Oct-24 04:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I would say so - early on, it hurts a lot more if you produce a lot of something and can't sell it right away


[10-Oct-24 04:07 PM] igfloz#0000
well, you are gona start to look at "what do I have to supply / week" - and what can I "bring back /week" I think - daily is good, but can be a bit to granular starting off maybe ? - please guys call me out if I am wrong on this ?


[10-Oct-24 04:08 PM] mancules#0000
Ya, that makes sense I'm thinking based on the daily traded focusing solely on TRU would be a bad call, the planner I made would be producing nearly 1k per week which on a good week is about 1/3 from the looks of it


[10-Oct-24 04:09 PM] mancules#0000
Maybe branching out into other aluminum based products would help so I'm not trying too throw too much into one market


[10-Oct-24 04:10 PM] mancules#0000
I'll plan around with that on the planner, thanks for the info guys


[10-Oct-24 04:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
np, that's what we're here for 🙂


[10-Oct-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
Imo WEL bases are super finicky. I think it's a great addition to some PP2s on Nike, though


[10-Oct-24 05:07 PM] mancules#0000
Do you guys typically produce multiple things on your base, or stick to one thing? I was looking at just ALO production and maxing out the base area it would be one of the more profitable ways I could go with a solid ROI, but if I did that I would be producing about 2800 ALO weekly, which is a sizeable amount compared to the weekly traded volume, I could always sell some of it at a different CX but then again right now I only have two ships so that doesn't sound too realistic atm, even going with SME and making AL I run into a similar issue


[10-Oct-24 05:08 PM] mancules#0000
I was looking into different aluminum options in the WEL and I could make a few different products but a lot of them have such a low trade volume it doesn't feel like a good investment atm


[10-Oct-24 05:12 PM] igfloz#0000
My ALO production. The BEST  thing that I did was to find someone who would reliably buy it off me (outside the CX)  - My extra ALO I have started smelting and I WILL be looking for a reliable buyer of AL at some point. The CX for me was too much up and down and worrying about a profit loss. I started looking at it as a volume move opportunity, which still made me some income

[10-Oct-24 05:13 PM] igfloz#0000
don't get me wrong, any excess still goes on the CX, but I kinda forget about it not depend on it


[10-Oct-24 05:15 PM] mancules#0000
Word, so sounds like a solid strategy but did you have the buyer going into it or afterwards? Dealing with the CX short term in this case doesn't sound too bad but I wouldn't know how to go about finding a regular buyer


[10-Oct-24 05:15 PM] mancules#0000
Kind of related, but do players fund others to get set ups like this or would that be more of headache when you can just make your own base doing it?


[10-Oct-24 05:17 PM] igfloz#0000
you are already in the right discord to enable you to to find (or be pointed to) a buyer. You will be surprised at the amount of times player X offers a prun plan build and player Y shouts up saying, I'll take it all, lol - but it's not a guarantee 🙂


[10-Oct-24 05:17 PM] jvaler#0000
some established players do. it has to do with the return on investment of high level HQ upgrades required for more bases. they get exponentially(?) more expensive, so it becomes better to help out a new player and just take a cut off the top. or sometimes no cut at all, just purely to give themselves a stable supply line.


[10-Oct-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
@riseoffilth do you have any need for ALO? or could they run any other bases you have a need for? they seem interested


[10-Oct-24 05:19 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yes


[10-Oct-24 05:19 PM] igfloz#0000
boom ! and there he is - what an entrance !! lol


[10-Oct-24 05:20 PM] riseoffilth#0000
ill buy any ALO for a good price


[10-Oct-24 05:20 PM] riseoffilth#0000
also buy AL if selling

[10-Oct-24 05:21 PM] igfloz#0000
@mancules now you have to learn how much of a CX loss you are gonna get for immediate sales, VS CX put it up for a month sales


[10-Oct-24 05:22 PM] mancules#0000
Makes that easy lol, I'm sure you're not looking for 15 AL a day but I'll keep you in mind while I get production moving


[10-Oct-24 05:22 PM] igfloz#0000
...which might not be for this channel 🙂


[10-Oct-24 05:23 PM] mancules#0000
I figured there must be a reason there's so many bids(asks?) for a 100 over for AL


[10-Oct-24 05:23 PM] mancules#0000
Is that essentially sellers waiting for someone like Rise to come in and scoop everything up regardless of price?


[10-Oct-24 05:24 PM] igfloz#0000
maybe, maybe not - I'm sure Rise's stockpiles are already huge, but who knows how markets react eh ?

[10-Oct-24 05:32 PM] igfloz#0000
so , back to my player X / Player Y example, If you were to have 1000 REP (following Jvalers image for ease of use)
let's say you (as player X) wanted to sell for 600 - you could have that ASK order up for weeks with a few nibbles (?) - BUT if you had an agreement with another player (player Y) for a repeatable sale for , eh, I dunno maybe 500 - 550 maybe then you have your volume moving, but you are not maximising a sale profit per-se


[10-Oct-24 05:33 PM] mancules#0000
Ya that makes a lot of sense, and then I'm not selling everything at the bottom price point just to offload it and pay the bills

[10-Oct-24 05:40 PM] mancules#0000
The help and info is always appreciated fellas, I think for the starter base I'm just going to focus AL production, it's a safe bet I can easily find a buyer it seems and even then it still moves well enough on the CX, I'll look into new production lines down the road once I can start considering expanding bases or making new ones. While I'm working on filling in this plan, I'm thinking building all the extractors first would be the best course of action since they seem to have a higher ROI, that make sense? https://prunplanner.org/shared/639dfce5-766e-4205-b712-884c1aa013b9 my prun plan in all its glory

[10-Oct-24 05:46 PM] igfloz#0000
I dunno,..... the COGC is metallurgy for Deimos, you will probably get a better return if you just max SME .... er and maybe +1 STO (AL is heavy)


[10-Oct-24 05:48 PM] igfloz#0000
for example, I EXT ALO on Nascent and SME AL on Vulcan (I didn't manage to get a Deimos slot 🙂 )


[10-Oct-24 05:48 PM] mancules#0000
I've got the ALO so I'm producing just enough to keep up with AL production, you think it would be better to just focus the one then?


[10-Oct-24 05:49 PM] mancules#0000
Checking it on the prun planner it looks like I can make more money producing my own ALO, but ik the prun planner isnt always right


[10-Oct-24 05:49 PM] igfloz#0000
I would always use the production (and experts) that favour the COGC as a newer player - there are examples where this isn't necessarily true, but thats future you 🙂


[10-Oct-24 05:51 PM] jvaler#0000
@mancules looks like you've got things figured out, i'll send you your grant in a few mins


[10-Oct-24 05:51 PM] igfloz#0000
make your own ALO if you wish, but you are missing the COGC for Deimos (which is Metallurgy) - EXT  COGC is Resource extraction

you can, but you likely don't have enough money to meaningfully do so


[11-Oct-24 12:47 AM] jvaler#0000
playing the market is a very long game. it can take weeks or even months for your stakes to pay off, so it's not great for when you're a new player and your liquidity is highly important to your growth


[11-Oct-24 12:48 AM] jcheung#0000
you can play it for smaller gains if you're very active, but a sudden disruption to the status quo could leave you stuck for months until it recovers


[11-Oct-24 12:49 AM] jcheung#0000
in the meantime, you can make plans for the future


[11-Oct-24 12:50 AM] jcheung#0000
and as a pro player you have the option to try to find some loans if you wish to expand faster


[11-Oct-24 01:00 AM] evov#0000
r.e. Loans - There's also ways to structure loans as "Production Backed Loans"
I give you Money now. You give me the stuff you make at your base later. Instead of paying back cash with interest, you pay back in product... with a bit more product instead of interest.

If you know how much your base produces each day/week etc - you can take the loan, buy the inputs needed, and comfortably spend the rest of the loan on upgrading/expanding... safe in the knowledge that the production of your base will cover the loan repayment by the due date.


[11-Oct-24 06:30 AM] mancules#0000
Oh I like this method, that was one worry I had when we were talking about it yesterday, if I took a loan out now worrying about being able to pay it off with just a starter base seemed pretty daunting, but I feel like this method would be a little more of a safer endeavor early on assuming you can find a lender interested


[11-Oct-24 06:32 AM] cuendilar#0000
i'm not interested in loans. i'll slow-boat this game. i know loans can cut your playtime down but... nah. 😄

It's a format I've offered many times in the past. But there hasn't been much interest in people taking it up. Not sure why.. maybe it's just harder to natively understand? The fundamentals are ... just better imo. You get the money, you pay back with production, so there's a lot of risk and concern that gets mitigated.


[11-Oct-24 06:35 AM] razenpok#0000
Are there any loans like this that you offer now?

[11-Oct-24 06:38 AM] evov#0000
I think the main reason people "feel" differently about a production backed loan like that, compared to just straight up cash + interest is due to the innate cognitive bias against loss.

Kinda like a monkey hates losing 1 banana, much more than they like getting 1 banana.

The visual of seeing a declining price per unit "feels" bad.


[11-Oct-24 08:59 AM] cuendilar#0000
0.4% per day is 146% annual, right? or do you mean 0.04%?


[11-Oct-24 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Don't look at APR


[11-Oct-24 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Not how interest works in prun


[11-Oct-24 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Usual interest period is one week


[11-Oct-24 09:15 AM] jcheung#0000
I didn't bite because when i finally learned about it, i was winding down my base expansion


[11-Oct-24 09:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, I'm also confused by this example since the 1 day loan (if I'm interpreting it right) is paid back by 1,000,285 AIC worth of AL


[11-Oct-24 09:17 AM] jcheung#0000
I believe the first day may have some rounding


[11-Oct-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
Actually i think all days have a little rounding


[11-Oct-24 09:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
and the 90 day one is 999,957.48 AIC?


[11-Oct-24 09:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'd take that loan 😛


[11-Oct-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
How do you get that?


[11-Oct-24 09:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
525.74*1902


[11-Oct-24 09:19 AM] jcheung#0000
Not how this works


[11-Oct-24 09:19 AM] jcheung#0000
525/u is what it looks like after interest takes the per unit price down


[11-Oct-24 09:20 AM] jcheung#0000
It is a favorable deal though, but if you start at 715/u then 90 day is 1.36m total repayment

{Reactions}
👆 

[11-Oct-24 09:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
so the interest is volume * (final price of your loan duration - final price at the top)?


[11-Oct-24 09:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
or interest portion of the loan, rather


[11-Oct-24 09:22 AM] jcheung#0000
Stby 1


[11-Oct-24 09:22 AM] jcheung#0000
Let me get out of bed and get the cobwebs out of head


[11-Oct-24 09:23 AM] mancules#0000
So, if I understand then when it comes to this kind of loan, would all of your production go back to paying off the loan then? So for the duration of the payback you woudn't essentially make any liquid profit on it even though the unit price is good?


[11-Oct-24 09:23 AM] jcheung#0000
it depends on your model


[11-Oct-24 09:23 AM] jcheung#0000
but no


[11-Oct-24 09:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, it must be - (715-525.74) * 1902 = 359,972.52, which is approximately .36 of 1 M (.4% daily simple interest for 90 days)


[11-Oct-24 09:24 AM] jcheung#0000
yes


[11-Oct-24 09:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you look at the '1.5x buffer' column, he does the math on how many buildings it'd take up approximately. so the 90 day loan would take up about 3 smelters


[11-Oct-24 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, I personally don't do the commodity backed loans because they're more complicated to administer, and the lender takes on price risk. but that doesn't mean they're not worthwhile as a borrower if one wanted to go that route


[11-Oct-24 09:27 AM] jcheung#0000
so this is day 0

although i'm not sure where exactly they're rounding


[11-Oct-24 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
in any case it's a better deal than lowstrife's


[11-Oct-24 09:38 AM] jcheung#0000
at least at .004/d


[11-Oct-24 09:40 AM] jcheung#0000
if you want to flip the script here, instead of final ppu you can list ppu under mat/loan size
then convert final ppu to interest equivalent and list credits


[11-Oct-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
also your day 1 is wrong, it should be day 0 😉


[11-Oct-24 09:55 AM] mancules#0000
Think I got this figured out, thanks you guys


[11-Oct-24 09:55 AM] mancules#0000
Doesn't seem like a terrible idea after getting one base set up to get a second one quickly up and running


[11-Oct-24 09:56 AM] mancules#0000
Might consider this route once I get my first base built and finished


[11-Oct-24 10:59 AM] jcheung#0000

...am i using that word right?


[12-Oct-24 12:46 AM] evov#0000
No idea, but I understand what you mean haha. There's lots of options to make it look differently.

Personally - It's not something that really moves the needle for me, I don't care if people take up the offers or not 🙂  I put them out there as an offer to help people with deals that are mutually beneficial. 

From my perspective - the real value in offering those deals (especially with zero marketing appeal on them )is that the people who accept them tend to be people who I'd be interested in doing more ongoing business with.


[12-Oct-24 01:05 AM] superbadsounds#0000
This reminds me of speculation markets in a way.


[12-Oct-24 01:06 AM] superbadsounds#0000
Have you ever had it burn you with a market falling out from under the leveraged materials?


[12-Oct-24 01:16 AM] evov#0000
I don't think anyone's actually taken me up on that specific offer. Had a couple of similar arrangements, but no-one have ended poorly. The values involved are such that even if it did go horribly wrong . . .  I still don't think I'd feel "burned" by it.


[12-Oct-24 01:16 AM] jcheung#0000
if i had been offered that at the start instead of when i was semi established, i would have been all over it


[12-Oct-24 01:17 AM] jcheung#0000
in fact i think i had done a similar deal with insula with slightly worse rates right before the first time i saw yours


[12-Oct-24 01:22 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I think I started drawing up those production backed loans about 7 months ago. The tooling is still there to set it up for pretty much any product. It's just one of those types of things I throw out there from time to time. If people are interested in it... cool. If not... cool.


[12-Oct-24 01:23 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe toss it in #bulletin-board ?


[12-Oct-24 01:24 AM] evov#0000
The important thing ( and for relevance in this channel ) - Just trying to get newer players thinking about, and being open to some different options that help speed up expansion.


[12-Oct-24 01:25 AM] jcheung#0000
right, i said bulletin board because it should be slower moving


[12-Oct-24 01:25 AM] jcheung#0000
a single new player could move this channel by over 200 lines in an hour


[12-Oct-24 04:40 AM] cuendilar#0000
whats the percentage of people that take the loan and stop playing @evov ?


[12-Oct-24 04:41 AM] cuendilar#0000
also i assume if you put that on Deimos, you'll find people who take it.


[12-Oct-24 04:41 AM] evov#0000
I can't give a good answer... because I've had very few people take me up on the offer. So... in my experience, zero.


[12-Oct-24 04:42 AM] evov#0000
Lowstrife has given out a lot of loans, and has reasonably good numbers on default rates etc.


[12-Oct-24 04:43 AM] cuendilar#0000
90d is a long commitment. if someone would take that, he should be damn hell sure he fullfills his part of the deal.


[12-Oct-24 04:45 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I don't think that's a loan duration that interests me either. I just included it to give a more... complete.. overview of how loan duration impacts the other numbers.

[12-Oct-24 04:53 AM] evov#0000
I think the .... "loan type" that is the best fit for new players is one where the established player supplies the inputs, transport them to your base, and buy the outputs at price that reflects it. Pay for it now, and pick them up at a later point in time. Kinda like the production backed loan, but the lender also assumes the logistical load and pushes the risk element as close to zero for the new player as is possible.

It's a bit more work on the cognitive and logistics side than I'm really interested in, but that feels like it has the best tradeoffs between established players and new players that leverage the unique benefits of both. It's something I'm considering as an aspect of a project I'm working on.  (basically, removing the shipping requirements and removing the capital costs of stock... is like covering low permit players in fertilizer and watch how fast they grow)


[12-Oct-24 04:57 AM] cuendilar#0000
From a new perspective player, i can tell you: thats not what i look for. I'd look for advice on how to do things. like this channel here... thats WAY more helpful than someone who basically does all the "work" - like supplies input, transport etc. - and that way kinda prevents me from doing all that. I think the best "loan" would be a mentorin/production-backed loan... similar as in the starting quests, established players could craft pre-defined questlines for new players that pick up on where the NPC-Quests end... THAT would be awesome, actually now that i think about it... i'll do that as soon as i have a healthy base established! 😄

Players play games for fun... If something is challenging for them (like learning how to be successful in Prun, per their own designs), and maybe fun as well, then they will stick to the game for longer, get more satisfaction from it, and be more willing to contribute towards the designs of others, if everyone is seeking the same thing. You have a good amount of peeps that seek pure revenues, and who would be more incentivised to join several co-ops out there, that do pre-planned stuff per Evov's idea... But there's a whole spat of others, who want to figure out their own thing. 

Neither is bad, you just need to find the customer who wants to buy your product, else it's a product/customer mismatch.

It's like buying a jalopy (old and wrinkled car), and then going through the time, effort, and expense of learning how to fix it up, tune it, maintain it, and then drive it, with a smile on your face forever.....

Compared to buying some BMW from a dealership, and having a whole service package included, with no real additional effort from you. You'll have a smile on your face thereafter, as well.


[14-Oct-24 05:55 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I am wondering as to my next steps.

My water base, base 2 on ISA is almost full.
The next base, base 3 was to make CAF to go into COF production on base 4.

But i'm better off selling the water in Antares instead of making CAF.

So, should i build base 3 and base 4 in tandem, to make better use of the water/caf, or should i set up a secondary water base, as it turns out that water is wildly profitable right now


[14-Oct-24 06:49 AM] tanda#0000
you're right about the current market trends making selling the water more profitable than anything else. I might suggest your plan of action be the following


[14-Oct-24 06:51 AM] tanda#0000
1) Sell the water until the market starts hitting correction. One it's back down to about 50/unit pull the trigger on any new bases
2) Use the money you make to get your ship upgrades early through Schaitr
3) Once it hits the correction point, drop base 4 and make straight drinking water to cash in on the 100/unit DW prices
4) Once that calms down, drop base 3 and start your own COF production


[14-Oct-24 06:52 AM] tanda#0000
I know of at least 3 water bases that got dropped in ANT including yours so a correction is coming


[14-Oct-24 06:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Sounds like a solid plan

hello, i am currently saving towards expanding to Ice Station Alpha to have a combination of excess water to sell, and also to fuel my Harmonia farm base. I have come up with this so far and was curious if there is any input as it seems fairly simple compared to some plans ive seen. For the selling water, it does appear there is a higher volume the past week or so than the recent average, which may indicate less demand, but it still appears to be fairly profitable even at the lower price it was a month ago. Anyone have input if that is decent long term cash, or if that market is saturated?

it also appears this should be easily scalable in this format, so i should be able to start small and build to that, or further.

what do you grow on Harmonia at the moment?


[17-Oct-24 06:48 PM] icooper#0000
Currently have 3 farms, 1 each making nuts, grains, and beans. I have 2 food processors making RAT and DW (i know this isnt efficient long term, i'm planning to make a 3rd fp base at some point once these two are closer to done), and 2 rigs getting water to fuel it.


[17-Oct-24 06:49 PM] icooper#0000
my eventual plan is to off load rigs to ISA, change harmonia to only farms, and have a FP base that just does that


[17-Oct-24 06:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
personally the materials required to get set up on ISA are quite step for a second base, I think it would be better to buy water (the price has come down) and then expand farms and expand to say Norwick to do FP


[17-Oct-24 06:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
bc you need both INS and HSE

Hot planets are a bit expansive


[17-Oct-24 07:15 PM] icooper#0000
so, messing with that idea Hal, if I expand to norwick, i could have a slightly higher profit per day, for quite a bit less development cost. This is maxing the farm out on production, then having an FP that is built enough to keep all the FPs running full time, and leaves a lot of room for future expansion.  Profit of 40,750/day, with a development cost of 668,500, almost 300k cheaper than the ISA base, and about 4k more per day profit.

Since you always want to expand, try to weight your options first. Small profits are still profits, you can refit bases later... just keep expanding. Also add 1 STO to your farm base (it will use the rest of free area left and give you 5000m3/5000t space).

[17-Oct-24 07:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
Usually you want to fill your areas first before expanding but with farms it's a bit different story. Since you not gonna generate that much money in comparison with new FP base with just a few buildings

{Reactions}

[17-Oct-24 07:25 PM] icooper#0000
thats good to know. I'm also not 100% sure at which point i get a new permit to be able to expand to additional area on the same base, or build a 3rd. The combo of those 2 could be good when I have the farm area maxxed out eventually, as it would allow more usage of space on the FP base.


[17-Oct-24 07:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
It’s ultimately up to you, but I did run a 3-permit harmonia for a long time to feed a full FP base on Norwick


[17-Oct-24 07:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
It’s not ideal since you get less base area per permit that way, but it can hold you over until you’re able to set up a hydroponics base elsewhere 🙂


[17-Oct-24 07:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ I also use multi-permit base since you got bonus from experts that already there and it's easier on logistics. Try to keep some cash on you always so you can fix mistakes if any accrue before expanding. Always chose resupplying over expanding when counting your cash


[20-Oct-24 08:25 AM] icooper#0000
I'm not sure the best process for this, but I think I would like to go ahead and apply for the grant to finish upgrading my farm base, and settle Norwick for a food processing base. I've done some more upgrades to my farm, so the actual development cost for both bases at this point is about 500k, with the intention of using the balance to upgrade my Harmonia farm base to 2 permit as soon as I have one available, to better utilize the food processing. Is this a sound starting strategy, or is there something that would be more profitable for a equitable amount of effort?


[20-Oct-24 08:27 AM] laaxus#0000
FP are a very good investment


[20-Oct-24 08:28 AM] laaxus#0000
You should share a prunplanner base of what you plan to spend the money on

They are above, but these are the two that would come out of that funding: 

Farm: https://prunplanner.org/shared/9f68c734-ae84-4fb8-b901-b8f29953a044

FP: https://prunplanner.org/shared/c657df08-3e8b-4eea-b4cd-ede861f7f678

I already have a decent chunk of the farm built, thankfully

don't forget to set experts-after doing up all experts you can support 9 FP


[20-Oct-24 03:27 PM] jcheung#0000
also after you get the FP you have planned built out, you may want to consider setting BEA to the faster recipe (the one that takes more water) so you can support more FP


[20-Oct-24 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
can add another FP you can support with it, up to 10


[20-Oct-24 03:28 PM] jcheung#0000
or, alternatively


[20-Oct-24 03:29 PM] jcheung#0000
you can set to the fast BEA and turn the extra capacity into HER production which you can use for FIM


[20-Oct-24 03:32 PM] jcheung#0000
this would leave you at a slight deficit in FP products, or you could do 10 FP and have a slight excess

either way though, assuming you only feed with harmonia, you'll end up with a fair bit of empty space on norwick unless you find something else to fill it out with


[20-Oct-24 03:37 PM] icooper#0000
Yeah I’m gonna try to balance this, I’m planning an etherwind water extraction base so I may use some for at least the DW I use for my bases


[20-Oct-24 03:38 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, if you extract h2o that'll give your FPs more to crunch for sure


[20-Oct-24 04:11 PM] jvaler#0000
etherwind is pretty far to be shipping water


[20-Oct-24 04:11 PM] jvaler#0000
well, the FRMs don't take up much of your 2 starters so it should be fine


[20-Oct-24 04:13 PM] icooper#0000
I gotcha, I had planned to buy water to start then see where that gets me, the plan when I get water extraction is to sell excess, then warehouse water for my bases at ANT and pick it up when doing station runs from that side of the production line, not really shipping straight from Etherwind to Harmonia


[20-Oct-24 04:14 PM] icooper#0000
But yes I see how that could be an issue if the other two bases were larger

In my opinion you are not eligble for a grant anymore.

- You've already received a grant in the past.
- You've coliqued and therefore wasted the initial grant
- You did not liquidate all your assets beforehand and tried to give us the money back before you left prun. 

A lot of PRUN is based on trust. We have entrusted you with a grant so you can be part of the Antares development initiative and it did not go well. Until now you have not build up enough trust again to grant you a new grant.

This is strictly my opinion and others on this discord might have a different view. But I dont think this would be fair for other people that are seeking grants.

Not trying to accuse you of deliberately being harmful, but the fact, that you had the possibility to reimburse some of the grand or at least discuss with the community what to do, since your account wasn’t deleted, makes the matter worse. It shows little to no respect to the people literally giving away money (and in a sense real-life time spend earning it) to support new players.

Ooo. i guess I'll pitch in... I'll keep it very short.

I was going to whip that person this morning with some of my poetry.... but you peeps did a better job with some straight talk. 

Two points:

- 1) Trust can be defined in many ways. I'd like to consider it as being part-in-parcel, involving a **common understanding** (expectations, if anything), a **common standard** (I'm usually slapping people with wiki links through the in-game chats), and a **common goal** (its in this server name). 2/3rds of that description is missing form ADI's intake process (**my perception**). Take it for what you will.

- 2) AGP coordinators should have receipts. Bill them for the remaining escrow, if they want back in ASAP... Of course since that person COLIQ'd, it'll take longer, than if they stayed in the game (I wouldn't increase limits on them though, per point #1). People make mistakes. Give them some hard work, so that they can learn from those mistakes.

Hey guys, I just wanna throw this out there: there is _no obligation_ to pay back the ADI grant, participate in ADI, or really do anything on receipt of the grant. It's just free money for new players. I don't know about giving a grant to someone that's received it already - that's probably up to @jvaler to decide, but nobody is required (or expected) to pay back the money if they quit

However... The aforementioned behavior will still happen, statistically. Not due to bad players, but just due to mistakes.

Like I said, that's a decision we should leave up to jvaler as project admin.

Those are "intro" parameters. Not "outro" parameters, if you decide to COLIQ as a grantee, on short notice.....

This shouldn't be a big ask, but anyone who can .... ohh sheet... only PROs can issue conts... 

*Anyone who is wanting to immediately exit, providing short notice, should post here in #agp-operations, regarding their intentions, with immediate liquidation, and no ill-intention should be regarded of them, provided that such outro-stuff gets fulfilled?*

This is less of an open-and-free #environment stuff, and more regarding the #morale of your staffing. I assure you, it's a very small ask... ~7 day timers for grant terminations + liquidations... COLIQ to a better spot, and you can get #reassigned the same benefits as before?

It's less of the "action", and more of the "thought" put behind the action.

[23-Oct-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
Anyway, to be clear, I'm personally not in favor of handing out an ADI grant with any conditions attached beyond what's in the screenshot above. I think our current requirements of "just show us you have a plan so we can help you avoid newbie traps" is really good for getting people started in the game. I'm just saying that we should talk to jvaler when they're online and figure out a rule about this specific situation - whether a person who has restarted is eligible for a second grant


[23-Oct-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I personally think that they should not be eligible, for what it's worth


[23-Oct-24 12:12 PM] laaxus#0000
My belief is that anybody should be able to ask for a grant, but it is not guaranted 

If he wants another grant, he must convince a donator.

I don't think it must go further than that.

There is two way we could approach this: Either every contributer decides that for themselfs. Or we do a poll with all Coordinators

[23-Oct-24 12:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm in favour of a delayed approach. We'll have a general intake/mentorship approach, regarding anyone, anywhere, who after say 1-2 weeks, will be able to apply for anything, provided that they have their fundamentals taken care of? I can pitch in, regarding this effort, but I'm of the opinion that it should be more of a communal thing... It's also maths' based... Early game decisions affect middle, and late-game outcomes. Discretely if you're not going to COLIQ... Even more if you do COLIQ...

There's casualties to either sidepipe's or roh's approach. BUT I'd rather have this conversation now, rather than 2 years down the road, ya know?


[23-Oct-24 12:21 PM] razenpok#0000
I'm more in favor of a less-overhead and less-rules approach. "Hey, I would like some money" - "Do you have a plan?" - "Yep" - "Here you go". And that's it. Less stress for both parties. Each contributor decides for themselves if they want to donate to any particular person. The incidents like the one above happen so rarely, we can handle them on a case-by-case basis.

[23-Oct-24 01:09 PM] markusium#0000
i am planning to go there, ill jsut set up on harmonai first


[23-Oct-24 01:12 PM] markusium#0000
ill repay it


[23-Oct-24 01:13 PM] laaxus#0000
What's the reasoning of not doing it now


[23-Oct-24 01:14 PM] markusium#0000
well, tehyre gonna be at a similar time, i jsut want to set up on Harmonia first (as that was the first option), ill propably go to Norwick 2-4 days after setting up base


[23-Oct-24 01:15 PM] laaxus#0000
Doing it 2-4 days later makes even less sense


[23-Oct-24 01:16 PM] laaxus#0000
Why not set up a 500 area farm on harmonia, then a 500 area fp base on norwick ?


[23-Oct-24 01:16 PM] laaxus#0000
What's your thought process


[23-Oct-24 01:16 PM] markusium#0000
okay, yeah sure sure i will do that, good idea actually


[23-Oct-24 01:17 PM] laaxus#0000
Please don't Say yes without understanding why 😭


[23-Oct-24 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
I didn't check the number, it might be a bad idea


[23-Oct-24 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
What are the pros and cons of dividing ?


[23-Oct-24 01:18 PM] markusium#0000
i understand now, becocuze Norwick is for food industries and Harmonia for famring


[23-Oct-24 01:19 PM] markusium#0000
qucikly thinking the only bad thing would propably me forgetting once or twice to send agriculture product from Harmonia


[23-Oct-24 01:20 PM] laaxus#0000
That's one pro
Another pro is that it's better, as dividing in two bases allow to get 1000 area with 2 permits, and not 3


[23-Oct-24 01:22 PM] pxlfox.#0000
just to explain - if you use your first permit to found a base on a planet you get 500 spaces to build. the second permit you use on the planet only gives you 250 additional spaces, not 500 more


[23-Oct-24 01:22 PM] pxlfox.#0000
therefore you get more space / permit, if you have only one on different planets


[23-Oct-24 01:23 PM] laaxus#0000
The cons is shipping


[23-Oct-24 01:23 PM] laaxus#0000
Do you think you Can ship the input goods you need


[23-Oct-24 01:25 PM] markusium#0000
Yes i do


[23-Oct-24 01:25 PM] pxlfox.#0000
👆 to check this, you can click on the blue button with the two arrows in PrunPlanner in the "Overview" box. It will show you how much you have to ship, how often you would need to send your ships back and forth and how quickly your storage will fill


[23-Oct-24 01:27 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not so sure


[23-Oct-24 01:29 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm also not sure you Can afford 2 bases what 1m


[23-Oct-24 01:29 PM] pxlfox.#0000
probaly not two full bases with restocks


[23-Oct-24 01:29 PM] jvaler#0000
i see... forgetting that your items and buildings can be liquidated is fair enough


[23-Oct-24 01:32 PM] pxlfox.#0000
my base on Harmonia costed me around 600.000 with the internal requests - around 800.000, if I would have bought it from CX


[23-Oct-24 01:34 PM] markusium#0000
alright, well ill go with my original plan, and once ill haave enough money ill create the second base


[23-Oct-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
I recommend you start with just the farm


[23-Oct-24 01:34 PM] laaxus#0000
Then you expand into the fp basz


[23-Oct-24 01:35 PM] markusium#0000
wouldnt it be better to set up FPs on Harmonia (first base) and once i get enough money to dissasemble them and build more farms and rigs?


[23-Oct-24 01:37 PM] laaxus#0000
There's 2 schools
Some people would recommend half frm half FP/INC
I recommend directly starting with a full 500 area of frm


[23-Oct-24 01:39 PM] markusium#0000
id rather go  half FRM, HALF FP, since tahts more requested then agriculture materials (i think, it makes sence to me)


[23-Oct-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
a mixed base would be more profitiable to begin with (as far as PP says)


[23-Oct-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
you could specialise the planets later on


[23-Oct-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
but be aware, that you will lose a few of the building materials


[23-Oct-24 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
Profit, yes but what about roi ?
I'm on phone so can't check


[23-Oct-24 01:41 PM] pxlfox.#0000
around 2 weeks with a mixed base


[23-Oct-24 01:41 PM] laaxus#0000
The only thing that ever matter for New players is roi


[23-Oct-24 01:41 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and 20 days with farms only


[23-Oct-24 01:41 PM] pxlfox.#0000
(again, taken from PP)


[23-Oct-24 01:42 PM] pxlfox.#0000
seems to be the better choice imo


[23-Oct-24 01:42 PM] laaxus#0000
Then it's ok


[23-Oct-24 01:42 PM] pxlfox.#0000
since you should have a few bucks leftover from the grand, the second base shouldn't be that hard to achive


[23-Oct-24 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend he keep the leftover


[23-Oct-24 01:43 PM] laaxus#0000
As buffer


[23-Oct-24 01:45 PM] markusium#0000
ill do that yeah


[23-Oct-24 01:45 PM] markusium#0000
IF


[23-Oct-24 01:46 PM] markusium#0000
i get it


[23-Oct-24 02:07 PM] markusium#0000
so, thats my plan there


[23-Oct-24 02:12 PM] tanda#0000
I'm interested in this, would like to buy a full permit worth of MAI for until you get your second base up and running


[23-Oct-24 02:27 PM] tanda#0000
Give me a few hours


[23-Oct-24 03:09 PM] markusium#0000
i apologisde for my ignorince(i never had this), what would this do?


[23-Oct-24 03:25 PM] igfloz#0000
I won't try and speak for Tanda, but offers like this kinda mean that he might fund your base- in exchange you produce and  sell all of your MAI to him (at an agreed price) - this will help you accrue funds to help with further expansion


[23-Oct-24 03:40 PM] jcheung#0000
or at least until you get your second base running

{Reactions}
👆 

[23-Oct-24 03:45 PM] markusium#0000
im deciding, ill answer later


[23-Oct-24 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
sometimes (not certain with this one without asking) the deal also means you're paid in advance for goods which you supply whenever you actually end up making it


[23-Oct-24 03:57 PM] markusium#0000
yeah, ill accept it


[23-Oct-24 03:57 PM] markusium#0000
but elts first discuss the details (ofcourse)


[23-Oct-24 04:01 PM] tanda#0000
Absolutely, I'll detail what I an proposing in a couple hours when I get home


[23-Oct-24 06:48 PM] tanda#0000
@markusium if you're down for it, this is what I'd like to you to run. It provides a good balance between the MAI supply I'd like, and providing you with a steady stream of income outside of that with RAT production.

[23-Oct-24 06:48 PM] tanda#0000
Your prior example showed a triple permit Harmonia, so I went ahead and made this a two permit


[23-Oct-24 06:52 PM] tanda#0000
1) I will give you the 1 million AIC (jvaler, don't you take away my pink name)
2) I want to buy all MAI surplus you generate at 200/unit
3) I'm willing to help with any shipping you may need for base setup or water transport, as well as subsidize water for you for a while.
4) I want to buy MAI from you until you drop a base on Norwick and need the FRM outputs for your own needs, or 30 days have passed, whichever is latest.
5) All MAI purchase will just be weekly contracts at Harmonia. I'll pick it up there


[23-Oct-24 07:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
2 STOs for 240t export per day?


[23-Oct-24 07:21 PM] tanda#0000
export per day is the MAI


[23-Oct-24 07:21 PM] tanda#0000
which will be MAI problem

Also, to give some context (and blame where it's due), MakryCz also joined KAWA after the first grant. It was a weird time for us in Antares, we promised them we'd be able to help with supply more, but then I [mostly] retired and our main Antares member quit so... we were not quite as supportive as promised. @markusium if you want some more assistance, or @tanda if you want some reimbursement for this deal, I'm happy to support them up to the million of their original grant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[01-Nov-24 08:45 AM] markusium#0000
I dont need another grant, thanks


[01-Nov-24 10:23 AM] tanda#0000
I'm solid,  but thank you for the offer


[03-Nov-24 05:48 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Hey, just wondering how much context you need for a grant application. Not been using prunplanner, mainly pen and paper but can get a spreadsheet or something sketched up with the numbers if needed!


[03-Nov-24 05:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can just write your plan and we can slap it into the prunplanner for better visualisation


[03-Nov-24 05:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
like Planet, buildings, recipes and etc


[03-Nov-24 05:57 PM] jcheung#0000
Prunplanner isn't strictly required but it's a great way to share the plans without any manual input from people viewing


[03-Nov-24 05:58 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Still trying to get my head around it haha


[03-Nov-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
You can make some plans without it


[03-Nov-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
And then we can help you figure it out with the data you supply


[03-Nov-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
That said, it all depends on whoever accepts your request

I recommend Lord's video if you're having problems setting up PRun planner


[03-Nov-24 06:02 PM] jcheung#0000
You could be as lax as "i want to make a base producing nothing but AL on deimos" and could get a positive reaction


[03-Nov-24 06:05 PM] rxbbxss#0000
I mean tbf, my plan is literally just 75% PPMK2 on nike by area, with the rest of the space for limestone extraction + experimenting on the locals


[03-Nov-24 06:05 PM] rxbbxss#0000
That's going to be fed with al ore (eventually just pure AL but my smelting gear is on Phobos until I move it over) from Nascent


[03-Nov-24 06:06 PM] tanda#0000
I will be honest and say I don't recommend the LST extraction. There's a lot of sellers on the planet that charge reasonable prices


[03-Nov-24 06:06 PM] jcheung#0000
Slight aside-we call those PP2s because you can type ``BUI PP2`` into a buffer


[03-Nov-24 06:06 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Oh yeah to be fair if it saves me the space I'll happily replace it with more PPMK2


[03-Nov-24 06:06 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Ahhh I get you


[03-Nov-24 06:06 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Yeah makes sense, I'm still learning all the shortcodes


[03-Nov-24 06:07 PM] jcheung#0000
If you see a 1-3 letter code, 90% of the time it goes into MAT XXX, otherwise it's BUI or CO


[08-Nov-24 05:08 AM] umbers#0000
Hello all. I'd like to apply for a grant to expand carbon production. My plan includes creating a FRM base on Harmonia and setting up additional INCs on my existing Phobos base.

Costs
Harmonia - 379990 (494300 - materials reclaimed from Phobos FRMs)
Phobos - 325480 (2 HB1 and 13 INC)
Consumables/H20 - 207257 (10 day buffer for total workforce)
Total - 912727

Profit - 69368 (At current AI1 sell price of 825)
ROI 12.98 days

Phobos - https://prunplanner.org/shared/d8fddecd-0bdb-4f65-9773-29b97e8018d6
Harmonia - https://prunplanner.org/shared/55fca61f-bac8-49aa-a9d0-fad98d98ab6b

[08-Nov-24 05:22 AM] laaxus#0000
Phobos is not recommended forINC


[08-Nov-24 05:22 AM] laaxus#0000
you should take a look at nascent


[08-Nov-24 05:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
^ or any planet with Resource Extraction CoGC, tho nascent is cheap to build on


[08-Nov-24 05:54 AM] umbers#0000
A Nascent base was my original plan, but the cost of setting up 2 additional bases meant a big dip to profit, and I'm too stubborn to COLIQ. I'm aware Phobos isn't ideal for INC, but I've already got half of what's planned constructed there. Seemed the better option was to double down on Phobos for now and expand to Nascent later with the profits from that.


[08-Nov-24 05:56 AM] umbers#0000
If the consensus is that's a terrible idea, I'll have another look at including Nascent in the plan later today


[08-Nov-24 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could think about tearing down your base on Phobos and relocate it to Nascent


[08-Nov-24 06:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You only have 2 permits, so a third base won’t be available, until you upgrade your HQ


[08-Nov-24 06:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Since your base is just a few days a lot (guessing), the loss in construction materials shouldn’t be too bad (please double check)


[08-Nov-24 06:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This would lead to some downtime, tho. So definitely not ideal


[08-Nov-24 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I would suggest to check the numbers on Phobos and Harmonia. 
If your Phobos base can eat up all the products of your FRM base, then there is no need to aim for better efficiency


[08-Nov-24 06:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And you can collect some money before moving your INC to another planet, when you need it


[08-Nov-24 06:09 AM] laaxus#0000
20% bonus is signficant


[08-Nov-24 06:09 AM] laaxus#0000
It Can almost double your profit in some cases


[08-Nov-24 06:15 AM] umbers#0000
Okay, thanks. Going to include tearing down Phobos as part of the re-plan. Oldest INC is 44 days, so think I'd only be losing out a tiny bit of MCG. Took a quick look, and it seems Harmonia can just cover the input needed for INCs on Nascent

[08-Nov-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
Let me know when you finish the re-plan and I’ll send you the grant 🙂


[09-Nov-24 05:50 AM] umbers#0000
Alright, reduced the number of initial FRM on Harmonia and starting with 20 INC on Nascent. Construction materials after deconstructing Phobos, plus consumables buffer comes to 874171, for a profit of 51998/d. The last ~130000 I thought I'd just keep liquid until everything is running in case of any issues.

[09-Nov-24 07:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
Looks solid to me! I’m on mobile right now, so sending contracts is rough, but if you send me one I’ll fill it. Just sell me one RAT or SF at ANT for 1M


[09-Nov-24 08:06 AM] umbers#0000
Ah, great! Also on mobile for a while. I'll get that sent later unless you beat me to it


[09-Nov-24 12:17 PM] umbers#0000
That's sent now. Think I've set it up correctly, but it's my first contract draft so just let me know if anything needs amending


[09-Nov-24 12:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Looks great, thanks for sending 🙂


[09-Nov-24 12:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
now go forth and make carbon!


[09-Nov-24 12:22 PM] umbers#0000
Ah, just noticed I chose Phobos instead of ANT. Would you like me to change that? Or should I just go ahead and fulfill?


[09-Nov-24 12:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can just request termination on the contract - I've already paid, so you'll keep the cash. no need to send me a :RAT:


[09-Nov-24 12:23 PM] umbers#0000
Okay. Thanks!


[10-Nov-24 08:17 AM] imjoshuarice#0000
I'd like to apply for the grant please.

Deimos, BMP

Considering doing a mix of MCG, EXO and PE to begin with as this keeps supplies within one ship for now.

Any thoughts?

BMP is a manufacturing building


[10-Nov-24 08:20 AM] laaxus#0000
while deimos is a metallurgy planet


[10-Nov-24 08:20 AM] laaxus#0000
see the efficiency factor ?


[10-Nov-24 08:20 AM] laaxus#0000
you should try to have 160%


[10-Nov-24 08:21 AM] laaxus#0000
if you want to do bmp, there's hephaestus


[10-Nov-24 08:21 AM] laaxus#0000
if you want to stay on deimos, you could do SME


[10-Nov-24 09:27 AM] imjoshuarice#0000
Hmm in that case, I can do the same plan but on Hephaestus. That said, you recently removed your BMP's there - anything I should know?


[10-Nov-24 09:30 AM] jcheung#0000
probably moving on to different chains that they feel are more profitable


[10-Nov-24 09:34 AM] laaxus#0000
BMP used to be profitable
I consider them not profitable enough
Not saying it's bad


[10-Nov-24 09:34 AM] laaxus#0000
My gameplay is to maximize the reward, whatever the risk


[10-Nov-24 09:38 AM] laaxus#0000
there's only 4 viables recipes for bmp : MCG EXO PE REP
the other don't sale fast enough

MCG requires a ton of shipping
PE is unstable because of the current C market
EXO REP don't sale fast (but enough that it's viable)
PE EXO REP are not profitable enough imo


[10-Nov-24 09:40 AM] laaxus#0000
BMP strength is to be able to swap recipes and adapt to the market


[10-Nov-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
currently, I'd produce PE


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] laaxus#0000
you should look at the pinned posts


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] laaxus#0000
it would give you insights on what is **possible**


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] laaxus#0000
then you can make your choice


[10-Nov-24 11:04 AM] imjoshuarice#0000
Yeah I'm fairly set upon doing Manufacturing, I'll head down to Hephaestus.

[10-Nov-24 12:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can tweak ratios on what is more profitable, but this 5 are major items


[10-Nov-24 01:28 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
Yeah that's more or less what I had in mind. I used to religiously produce REP, until I learnt the hard way to make sure you save enough to get through market weirdness like when MFK (or may have been SFK) literally dropped off the Market for a few days.

Exo looks promising but there isn't much movement per day hence why earlier I was suggesting I only do 1/3rd of my total production at most. I intend to do something similar to the above so I can build up a surplus for certain products until they are more profitable.

Hopefully the grant will help me get set on Hephaestus

Thanks Jean


[10-Nov-24 01:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
EXO was quite empty past 2 weeks. I've sold around 3-4k EXO


[10-Nov-24 01:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
and since I am stopping my EXO production, there will be spot


[10-Nov-24 01:33 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
😼 Excellent


[10-Nov-24 01:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
just try not to go below 220/u


[10-Nov-24 01:33 PM] marat_sh#0000

[10-Nov-24 01:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
around 240-260/u is a sweet spot


[10-Nov-24 01:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
at 230/u it's cheap


[10-Nov-24 01:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
and 220/u and lower it's not worth it


[10-Nov-24 01:35 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
I agree


[10-Nov-24 01:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
also if you see other markets increase price for it, don't be afraid to increase as well, or people will buy out supply and sell it on other market


[10-Nov-24 01:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
another tip, is to not sell 100% of your stock (consumables) In case if someone would manipulate market you have some reserves to help people out (more for future when you can afford to not sell)


[11-Nov-24 01:48 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
I think I'm happy with this plan for now until I've saved up a bit more

It's a no strings attached kind of deal. Do see if there are any offers you want to take up in #internal-offers , often the money goes a bit further that way. 🙂

You can ask folks about their offers in #trading if you have any questions.


[12-Nov-24 07:42 AM] rahzo_rsc#0000
Hey everyone, I am Razho, started out selling C on Phobos, then moved the C production to Ice Palace while keeping FRMs on Phobos. Now I got a base on Harmonia and will be moving all FRMs there. Leaving me with an empty base on Phobos. I was thinking about setting up Cleanrooms due to having leftover C and being able to use all of if, however it seems like the the items made with C dont sell to well, or are just slow in the market. I would like some ideas from more veteran players. I would however like to try and keep my chains self sufficient, and dont want to have to buy to many external Mats. Looking forward to the continued expansion of ANT. Slow and Steady!!


[12-Nov-24 08:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
It’s been a bit since I’ve looked at the electronics items (other than the ones I make, which also fall into this category), but my sense is that most electronics are slow on the market in general. If you’re really attached to the base on Phobos, you could always grow things there too. If not, you could consider doing chemistry with all that C


[12-Nov-24 08:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
For example, CL and DDT are two chemistry products that have been consistently profitable since I started making them like 9 months ago 😄


[12-Nov-24 08:39 AM] rahzo_rsc#0000
I mean I guess I am not more attached to the base then wanting to be the best C empire lol


[12-Nov-24 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
I see 😄


[12-Nov-24 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t actually make C, so someone else should confirm this, but I believe the triple burn recipe for C is the most profitable one - I think that’s the one that uses HCP and two other plants


[12-Nov-24 08:42 AM] rahzo_rsc#0000
expensive as well


[12-Nov-24 08:48 AM] jcheung#0000
It's around 20% or so more productive including a number of support bases compared to single GRN burn, at least on harmonia


[12-Nov-24 08:48 AM] jcheung#0000
Around two or three times higher shipping though


[12-Nov-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think if you plan to make just a few CLR you should advertise your products in this channel and you might find someone just willing to bulk purchase your products ahead of time.


[12-Nov-24 02:39 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't recommend clr for a beginner, unless he finds a contract


[12-Nov-24 02:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like I'd buy 100 SWF/d at maybe.. 210/u. You'd have to do the math to see if that works for you.


[12-Nov-24 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I probably have 10 CLR right now so if I had a reliable supply for the mix of basic components, I could convert some of those. I think most electronic manufacturers are vertically integrated like that but that’s just because there’s never been much supply.


[12-Nov-24 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
100SWF/d is 1 clr


[12-Nov-24 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't double check on mobile, but Price seems ok


[12-Nov-24 02:46 PM] laaxus#0000
If razho doesn't take your deal, I might @archielvahr if that's ok with you

and here I am pumping out SWF to fill Archiels current market order


[12-Nov-24 03:34 PM] getonthetrain#0000
was that you that also had some market orders for software components @archielvahr ?


[12-Nov-24 03:35 PM] getonthetrain#0000
that got taken down the other day?


[12-Nov-24 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep! Maybe they got filled, I had a mix so I don't recall what I had out


[12-Nov-24 03:36 PM] getonthetrain#0000
oh, well I am building up organically and am getting into that field if you need


[12-Nov-24 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think of the SD items, LDs are pretty flexibile, so I can buy those and substitute them into my chains


[12-Nov-24 03:37 PM] getonthetrain#0000
yea, doing LDs right now


[12-Nov-24 03:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will go through what I use from CLRs and SDs and update the orders


[12-Nov-24 03:38 PM] getonthetrain#0000
ok, I will fill if fairly priced

My attempt to prove I am a strong and stable financier and can be trusted with your prefabs:

Most of them are just daft notes/calculations, some not even prun related. Main ones are:
'Glass' is a sheet for calculating prefab requirements for construction.
'Materials' is for production method costs and P/L

Prices may be out of date on some of them!

[12-Nov-24 06:27 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Bahahaha, had half of this knocked up in airtable at one point


[12-Nov-24 06:28 PM] jvaler#0000
the main thing i look for is just market competency, like being able to tell if something is traded too thinly to sell into for reliable liquidity(which is important as a new growing player)


[12-Nov-24 06:30 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Makes sense! The main way I'm approaching that is mainly to do vertical integration. If prices for BBH etc start falling too low, I can mix in other basic prefabs, or start producing more RBH etc


[12-Nov-24 06:30 PM] rxbbxss#0000
If it drops below my production costs, well, that just means cheaper RBH production for me anyway


[12-Nov-24 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000
yup yup, if BBH price falls(it never does😶) then it just becomes a cheaper input for profits elsewhere

though when the input is high you'd rather be selling it than having the capital spent on the PP3 just sitting around and degrading... you always want your buildings running *something*


[12-Nov-24 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000
(bfab prices are basically always pinned to the market maker, you don't need to worry about them crashing)


[12-Nov-24 06:36 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Yeah, I figure stockpile and worst case I end up with a ship full and can just ship/get it shipped to another exchange


[12-Nov-24 06:37 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Ideally I want to get myself to a decent cushion of cash, then start getting into spaceship part fabrication (if not entire ships)


[12-Nov-24 06:37 PM] rxbbxss#0000
But my current aim is just getting nike and nascent maxed out for construction and AL production


[12-Nov-24 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Can't make any sense of your spreadsheet, but I consider that good enough a plan for me to send a grant 😄


[12-Nov-24 06:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
27 days with 3 bases, that's pretty good! Do you have loans out?

Enjoy 😄

🥳 

[12-Nov-24 06:48 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Yeah but they're covered under current production so far. Had to delay payment by a day on last one because I cocked up my timings on moving to Nike, but looking like smooth sailing now!

Request for grant.
Base proposal on Harmonia: https://prunplanner.org/shared/c7922ede-2036-46e1-acb5-aff1f4464c01
I estimate that I will be able to build out the base and begin production in approx 5 days.
In the short term this base will be used to provide basic food and water for the market. Near-term expansion will focus on additional FRMs to supply @tyrandia with inputs for her carbon base.
Thank you for your consideration

[16-Nov-24 04:26 AM] jvaler#0000
firstly, you should be using both luxury consumables. unless their prices are jacked way up they're basically always worth it. if there's a case where they aren't worth it, it's likely that the recipe you're running isn't profitable enough in the first place.

secondly, i highly advise against RIGs on harmonia. they just aren't worth it for the building cost and area used. you should just be importing water from the CX instead

60d ROI period is really really bad


[16-Nov-24 04:29 AM] jvaler#0000
the idea of having interim FP while you wait on lilidragon is a good one though


[16-Nov-24 04:42 AM] jcheung#0000
there's also no expert assignment


[16-Nov-24 04:43 AM] jcheung#0000
also any particular reason BEA slow recipie instead of BEA fast?


[16-Nov-24 04:44 AM] jcheung#0000
well, i guess it doesn't make a BEA that much faster


[16-Nov-24 04:53 AM] jvaler#0000
^^
you should plan based off 5 experts, because unless you plan on deconstructing the base you're going to get 5 eventually


[16-Nov-24 04:53 AM] jvaler#0000
especially when you're doing stuff involving ratios, like FRM feeding FP


[16-Nov-24 04:54 AM] jcheung#0000
though for agi/fp temp split i would more do 2/3 or 3/2 split


[16-Nov-24 04:55 AM] jcheung#0000
i personally would consider strongly adding HER to FRM, adding FRM, 4:2:2:1 BEA:VEG:GRN:HER, removing two RIG, 2:3:1 DW:RAT:FIM


[16-Nov-24 04:55 AM] jcheung#0000
takes you from 31k/d to 38k/d


[16-Nov-24 04:55 AM] jcheung#0000
assuming that you really really want to do water on harmonia


[16-Nov-24 04:55 AM] jcheung#0000
which, as jvaler pointed out isn't great


[16-Nov-24 04:56 AM] jcheung#0000
that being said, RAT inputs are currently a little... messed up


[16-Nov-24 04:56 AM] jvaler#0000
there isn't much of a reason to, it's terrible profits and minimal logi relief


[16-Nov-24 04:56 AM] jcheung#0000
so BEA/VEG/GRN is actually a pretty bad proposition right now


[16-Nov-24 04:57 AM] jcheung#0000
(C input)


[16-Nov-24 04:57 AM] jvaler#0000
FIM does sound good though, the base is pretty cheap so the grant should be able to cover a DDT buffer


[16-Nov-24 04:57 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah

basically followed the suggestions above as I comprehended them, but find myself with material net positives on raw food materials — think it’s reasonable to grow some MAI or HCP as well to feed fast-burn carbon plants?


[16-Nov-24 06:00 AM] jcheung#0000
MAI and HCP are terrible on FRMs


[16-Nov-24 06:00 AM] roche3950#0000
disregard: screws up the HER net positive


[16-Nov-24 06:00 AM] jcheung#0000
MAI and HCP are better off on HYF if you can do it there


[16-Nov-24 06:01 AM] roche3950#0000
down the line I suppose

(this assumes that prices hold ofc, which they might not)


[16-Nov-24 06:16 AM] roche3950#0000
you could flood the market with it


[16-Nov-24 06:16 AM] roche3950#0000
… no pun intended :ssun:

I need a 2k/2k ship


[16-Nov-24 06:16 AM] laaxus#0000

[16-Nov-24 06:18 AM] jcheung#0000
realistically though, pure DW on a FI COCG would handle....


[16-Nov-24 06:19 AM] jcheung#0000
roughly 10% of the daily CX volume


[16-Nov-24 06:19 AM] laaxus#0000
though for a pure dw fi on norwick, you'd need a 2k/2k full time


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] jcheung#0000
while consuming a quarter or so of the h2o volume


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
it's more realistic to do it on phobos


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] jcheung#0000
the... electronic world?


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
it's viable


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] jcheung#0000
at that point you may as well put the FP on the h20 extraction


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
(currently)


[16-Nov-24 06:20 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[16-Nov-24 06:21 AM] laaxus#0000
because extracting h2o doesn't make that much money


[16-Nov-24 06:21 AM] laaxus#0000
but if you buy it from zipatsu at cx price, then sure


[16-Nov-24 06:24 AM] jcheung#0000
cuts shipping volume by a third


[16-Nov-24 06:25 AM] jcheung#0000
well. also cuts consumption a fair bit too

actually not too bad on profit, surprisngly. not 165k/d mind you, but not bad

expensive to build though, at this location


[16-Nov-24 06:31 AM] jcheung#0000
(yes, it runs at a population deficit)


[16-Nov-24 06:34 AM] jcheung#0000
boucher is better, but is more HRT space-half cost and 87k/d


[16-Nov-24 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I think the DW is slowly correcting

[16-Nov-24 08:24 AM] roche3950#0000
it was so much easier 2 years ago on promitor hahahaha


[16-Nov-24 08:25 AM] roche3950#0000
but we have better tools now, build better bases.


[16-Nov-24 08:25 AM] jcheung#0000
~~well actually you serve a double function of being a piggy bank~~


[16-Nov-24 08:25 AM] jcheung#0000
market conditions are probably a little different as well compared to 2 years ago


[16-Nov-24 08:25 AM] roche3950#0000
indeed


[16-Nov-24 08:28 AM] roche3950#0000
adjusting ratios a bit more as I think 12/8 is causing it to go -ve on plant products


[16-Nov-24 08:30 AM] jcheung#0000
can spend hours doing that 😉


[16-Nov-24 08:30 AM] roche3950#0000
I used to love playing the Anno games, believe you me I am familiar 😄


[16-Nov-24 08:30 AM] jcheung#0000
this one runs positive on all produced goods, but also makes a lot of DW and not much RAT


[16-Nov-24 08:32 AM] jcheung#0000
though, again, you're welcome to tweak things in other ways 😄


[16-Nov-24 08:44 AM] roche3950#0000
also, you know what, I missed your ratios earlier


[16-Nov-24 08:44 AM] roche3950#0000
for the 12/8 schematic


[16-Nov-24 08:46 AM] jcheung#0000
okay, also, probably unpopular option, but is another option to consider.
can build out the original 500 area base with 13 FRM, then add a permit to give you 16 FP
77k/d

in around 60/120 days you can decommission the FPs and extra HB1's for very little cost and drop back down to 1 permit

[16-Nov-24 08:46 AM] jvaler#0000
please, take my money


[16-Nov-24 08:46 AM] jcheung#0000
this is generally considered a *short term* option


[16-Nov-24 08:47 AM] jcheung#0000
as permits are extremely expensive later on-but not when you're starting out


[16-Nov-24 08:47 AM] roche3950#0000
I think I'm going to stick with 12/8 and a balance of experts to keep imports to H2O, OVE, and the luxuries


[16-Nov-24 08:48 AM] jcheung#0000
derp i messed up the experts again....

[23-Nov-24 11:29 PM] earthforged#0000
ok, so i need to reset and move i think...


[23-Nov-24 11:29 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Make sure you read the info channel


[23-Nov-24 11:29 PM] earthforged#0000
ok, doing now


[23-Nov-24 11:30 PM] earthforged#0000
server info?


[23-Nov-24 11:30 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Agp information


[23-Nov-24 11:30 PM] earthforged#0000
gotcha, doing now


[23-Nov-24 11:31 PM] tanda#0000
Get your base planned out on PrunPlanner and posted in here before you reset. That way you're not just waiting


[23-Nov-24 11:31 PM] earthforged#0000
ok, is a metals processer in itself useful? i havent studied game past that yet


[23-Nov-24 11:32 PM] tanda#0000
It's a building block. All metals get moved into processing in either Construction or higher metallurgy, or used in ship building. AL is a very versatile metal that does a lot of things


[23-Nov-24 11:33 PM] tanda#0000
a full SME base on Deimos isn't going to have you rolling in the dough, but there will be a constant demand for your product


[23-Nov-24 11:34 PM] astra1414#0000
you get a 65% bonus to being cool when you pick antares too


[23-Nov-24 11:36 PM] earthforged#0000
even in my RL business i tend to choose steady cash flow over mountains of instant money. And a metals base seems it would give me a 2 road path


[23-Nov-24 11:37 PM] finestone#0000
I would reccommend consumbles then.


[23-Nov-24 11:37 PM] earthforged#0000
i can either keep growing it with more bases, adding in mining more things ...or use my metals as a component in future base builds


[23-Nov-24 11:37 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, that's a pretty solid suggestion. Real question is what theme you want for your company


[23-Nov-24 11:37 PM] earthforged#0000
Ok, i have to bring real life in for a second


[23-Nov-24 11:38 PM] finestone#0000
RAT or AL both good


[23-Nov-24 11:38 PM] astra1414#0000
if you are interested in doing AL on deimos you can ship to nike to make bfabs which is pretty decent early on, but consumables are probably more steady/stable. either or


[23-Nov-24 11:39 PM] earthforged#0000
in real life i own earthforged rock shop. i get to real life mine, i import minerals and crystals from all over the world..and have an actual crafting room i can cut and shape stone into jewelry and such


[23-Nov-24 11:39 PM] earthforged#0000
i love to mine things and i love importinf routes


[23-Nov-24 11:40 PM] earthforged#0000
so my theme right now i was looking at being a in game supplyer of materials to producers


[23-Nov-24 11:40 PM] finestone#0000
The only problem with pure EXT early is the shipping cost. Ores are heavy


[23-Nov-24 11:41 PM] finestone#0000
Eventually that is certainly doable. there are alot of planets that have minerals, gases, and ores that people want.


[23-Nov-24 11:41 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
There’s a WCB deal for new players on the other discord, but that’ll eat up most of the grant


[23-Nov-24 11:41 PM] finestone#0000
but you will need more ships and ships are millions


[23-Nov-24 11:42 PM] finestone#0000
I recommend building a full 500 base that has less than 200 daily import export with the grant


[23-Nov-24 11:43 PM] astra1414#0000
i think the most important thing to remember is you aren't really ever locked into one specific thing, you can always swap and change into other industries as you need and do other things.  so even if you don't get to do what you really want at the start, which im not saying you can't do, but, there are probably more ideal options that'll lead better into doing what you want more comfortably later on

[23-Nov-24 11:43 PM] finestone#0000
yepp just need a good solid money making base then expand into what your want to do as your grow


[23-Nov-24 11:43 PM] earthforged#0000
ok, so i need advice on what to study or build to grow into that direction


[23-Nov-24 11:44 PM] astra1414#0000
consumables, like rat for example, are a good starting point for steady and consistent income


[23-Nov-24 11:44 PM] astra1414#0000
or you can do extraction into metallurgy into construction


[23-Nov-24 11:44 PM] earthforged#0000
i want the second so i can at least mine and smelt


[23-Nov-24 11:45 PM] astra1414#0000
well deimos has alo, you can extract that and smelt it into AL on planet and then ship that al to nike to produce bfabs


[23-Nov-24 11:45 PM] finestone#0000
I would just sell the AL


[23-Nov-24 11:46 PM] astra1414#0000
at first, you'd be better off, i dont think the grant would cover the al base along with the nike base, but as a short/mid term goal for that you'd probably want to ship the al into bfabs


[23-Nov-24 11:47 PM] earthforged#0000
so, o and c are always on the market? or do i need to produce either on the side?


[23-Nov-24 11:47 PM] finestone#0000
I havnt run numbers on Bfabs honestly but i have heard they are not in a great spot comapred to MM


[23-Nov-24 11:48 PM] astra1414#0000
they should always be on the market, C will be your biggest expense more than likely


[23-Nov-24 11:48 PM] astra1414#0000
it's been a while since i've played but the price for C fluctuated quite a bit


[23-Nov-24 11:48 PM] finestone#0000
They are both available however C has been struggling to stay consistent lately i would reccomened buying from internal members such as @tanda or @.urpalhal or @pxlfox.

[23-Nov-24 11:49 PM] finestone#0000
O has been pretty good on the market lately


[23-Nov-24 11:49 PM] astra1414#0000
someone may even sell alo too at a fixed price


[23-Nov-24 11:50 PM] astra1414#0000
havent really heard that one before but it has been some months since i've played so perhaps? last i remember it was pretty good consistent profit


[23-Nov-24 11:51 PM] earthforged#0000
ok, im going to go reset my account and get my toon moved. Then ill lay out the base


[23-Nov-24 11:51 PM] astra1414#0000
welcome to antares officially (assuming you are coliqing from elsewhere)!!


[23-Nov-24 11:52 PM] finestone#0000
Plan your base in PruPlanner first so you pick the right starter planet


[23-Nov-24 11:52 PM] astra1414#0000
^ if you haven't gone through prunplanner yet, i'd get familiar with it

[23-Nov-24 11:52 PM] earthforged#0000
oh, i was suggested Deimos a couple times


[23-Nov-24 11:52 PM] astra1414#0000

learning the ui of prunplanner and also exploring your options is never a bad idea


[23-Nov-24 11:53 PM] earthforged#0000
truth


[23-Nov-24 11:53 PM] astra1414#0000
and you may find something else you want, or you may have questions


[23-Nov-24 11:55 PM] tanda#0000
Bfabs are actually in a better state these days. The MM cap on them was raised, not lowered


[23-Nov-24 11:55 PM] tanda#0000
so you can actually make more money from them. Again, stepping stones not dough makers


[23-Nov-24 11:57 PM] earthforged#0000
does prunplanner show bonuses, like the chamber of commerce one?


[23-Nov-24 11:57 PM] astra1414#0000
you can make it show them yes


[23-Nov-24 11:57 PM] earthforged#0000
im looking now


[23-Nov-24 11:57 PM] astra1414#0000
everything's toggleable


[24-Nov-24 12:00 AM] tanda#0000
It does it for planets that are known to have it


[24-Nov-24 12:00 AM] tanda#0000
so if you select Deimos it will show it with the metallurgy COGC by default


[24-Nov-24 12:43 AM] evov#0000
Hello friend 🙂  - I'll buy all the AL you can produce. In fairness, the same is probably true for everything that comes out of a smelter.

i will look up some videos just as soon as i finish restarting


[25-Nov-24 06:47 PM] earthforged#0000
any planet suggestion ..going thru them now


[25-Nov-24 06:48 PM] tanda#0000
For metallurgy: Deimos.


[25-Nov-24 06:48 PM] tanda#0000
Phobos is a trap, and Harmonia is for farming


[25-Nov-24 06:50 PM] earthforged#0000
ok..restarted Earthforged   EFM

ty, fixed ur nickname


[25-Nov-24 06:52 PM] earthforged#0000
EFM was better..EarthForged Minerals, but it wouldnt let me have it first time


[25-Nov-24 06:52 PM] tanda#0000
perhaps the account using it finally got wiped


[25-Nov-24 06:52 PM] earthforged#0000
i was about to buy my third house


[25-Nov-24 06:53 PM] earthforged#0000
ok gotta go do the tutorial again. be back


[25-Nov-24 07:05 PM] earthforged#0000
ok ,gotta run to grocery store with my better half. Soon as we get back ill work on setting up my base in the plnner so i can apply for the starter money


[25-Nov-24 07:06 PM] earthforged#0000
started same EXT and SME

👍 

[25-Nov-24 07:07 PM] earthforged#0000
it really does help that it a grant not a loan. loans are tough on starter businesses


[25-Nov-24 07:13 PM] earthforged#0000
whatvi dont know is how to set up mining other things in other places so im guessing..ill research more when i get home..i will mine aluminum..but have more smeltors for other resources. will have to buy other ores for now  i assume.


[25-Nov-24 07:14 PM] earthforged#0000
havent learned a lot past whats available tonme locally


[25-Nov-24 08:44 PM] earthforged#0000
Should i plan to make my own C and O?


[25-Nov-24 08:47 PM] tanda#0000
you should probably plan to make your own C, but not your own O


[25-Nov-24 08:48 PM] tanda#0000
but those should not be on Deimos


[25-Nov-24 08:48 PM] earthforged#0000
oh so not on base 1


[25-Nov-24 08:49 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, that should be base 2 and 3. You can grow and burn on Harmonia for base 2 and then move the INC to Nascent for base 3


[25-Nov-24 08:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
maybe make your own O, but like much later


[25-Nov-24 08:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
base like 10 maybe


[25-Nov-24 08:59 PM] earthforged#0000
ok. i dont really know what to do past mining and dmeltibg for now.


[25-Nov-24 09:00 PM] earthforged#0000
im assuming aluminum is the only thing i can mine..i didnt get a chance to look


[25-Nov-24 09:00 PM] earthforged#0000
does anyone regularly bring back an ore they need smelted?


[25-Nov-24 09:01 PM] earthforged#0000
is it 6 experts per base?


[25-Nov-24 09:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
6 total across all industries


[25-Nov-24 09:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But 5 max in one industry


[25-Nov-24 09:06 PM] earthforged#0000
oh


[25-Nov-24 09:07 PM] earthforged#0000
do they stack?


[25-Nov-24 09:12 PM] earthforged#0000
ill look em up.  almost home


[25-Nov-24 09:13 PM] earthforged#0000
anything else i want to think about before i build?


[25-Nov-24 09:13 PM] jvaler#0000
yes, very well. the jump from 4 -> 5 experts is the most impactful

you can find the numbers in the handbook, it should be under the "efficiency factors" section


[25-Nov-24 09:14 PM] jcheung#0000
really?


[25-Nov-24 09:14 PM] jcheung#0000
huh. i thought they were flat this whole time


[25-Nov-24 09:14 PM] earthforged#0000
im going to make a small assumption that there will be ores priced well enough to smelt and profit?


[25-Nov-24 09:15 PM] jcheung#0000
...granted you probably get 1-4 in the time it takes 4->5


[25-Nov-24 09:16 PM] earthforged#0000
any other advixe?


[25-Nov-24 09:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of people here would be happy to buy all your metal locally, if you ever want to sell some without shipping it. Ore shouldn't be too costly generally.


[25-Nov-24 09:18 PM] earthforged#0000
advice


[25-Nov-24 09:18 PM] jcheung#0000
question. are you free license right now?


[25-Nov-24 09:18 PM] earthforged#0000
before i lay out basr
no pro


[25-Nov-24 09:19 PM] jcheung#0000
ok, cool


[25-Nov-24 09:19 PM] jcheung#0000
lay out the base and share it, then there will probably be another round of feedback on the base itself


[25-Nov-24 09:45 PM] earthforged#0000
alright, finally home, doing now


[25-Nov-24 09:56 PM] earthforged#0000
its a lot more expensive on fuel to fly to market.


[25-Nov-24 09:59 PM] earthforged#0000
but its all good


[25-Nov-24 10:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
to deimos than from phobos?


[25-Nov-24 10:14 PM] tanda#0000
probably from Montem


[25-Nov-24 10:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ohhh


[25-Nov-24 10:19 PM] earthforged#0000
ok im really just mostly setting up smelters for first base...im comparing ore prices to finished sell prices


[25-Nov-24 10:20 PM] earthforged#0000
im sure in time i will do other things but i will have to study things i can do


[25-Nov-24 10:21 PM] earthforged#0000
mining different things thru the universe will be my fun


[25-Nov-24 10:22 PM] earthforged#0000
where does flux come from


[25-Nov-24 10:22 PM] jcheung#0000
~~the supermarket~~


[25-Nov-24 10:22 PM] tanda#0000
Chemicals plants processing Limestone


[25-Nov-24 10:22 PM] tanda#0000
LST>CHP


[25-Nov-24 10:23 PM] earthforged#0000
hmmm do i have limestone


[25-Nov-24 10:24 PM] earthforged#0000
flux gives extra output on some ores


[25-Nov-24 10:25 PM] tanda#0000
you don't right now. It is best to buy for a while.
When I first expanded to Nike and started running PP2's over there, I also ran like 2 CHPs out there just making LST into FLX


[25-Nov-24 10:25 PM] tanda#0000
it's a good 4th expansion


[25-Nov-24 10:27 PM] earthforged#0000
i get you .buy i have to lay out base 1 without really knowing where im eventually going with other bases...im studying smelting right now


[25-Nov-24 10:29 PM] earthforged#0000
to start im just going to put up a couple aluminum mines and a bunch of smelters and play the commoditoes game


[25-Nov-24 10:29 PM] earthforged#0000
commodities


[25-Nov-24 10:34 PM] earthforged#0000
7 HB1 4EXT and 8SME is what i would start with


[25-Nov-24 10:35 PM] earthforged#0000
that uses 331 of 500 spaces


[25-Nov-24 10:37 PM] earthforged#0000
do i need to do more?


[25-Nov-24 10:38 PM] jcheung#0000
buying flx at market is usually worth it


[25-Nov-24 10:38 PM] earthforged#0000
i need time to work with people and make contracts to supply


[25-Nov-24 10:38 PM] jcheung#0000
i would add at least one STO, maybe two


[25-Nov-24 10:38 PM] jcheung#0000
and then i would also try to fill out all 500 spots


[25-Nov-24 10:38 PM] earthforged#0000
oh yes ok.. let me add


[25-Nov-24 10:39 PM] earthforged#0000
i want to save cash for buy orders and such for ores


[25-Nov-24 10:40 PM] jcheung#0000
reducing the amount of ores you consume is pretty useful too


[25-Nov-24 10:40 PM] earthforged#0000
how much space does sto add


[25-Nov-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
5k


[25-Nov-24 10:41 PM] jcheung#0000
one is mandatory for SME bases. two is a great stress reducer


[25-Nov-24 10:41 PM] earthforged#0000
ok added 4


[25-Nov-24 10:41 PM] earthforged#0000
and 2 more sme


[25-Nov-24 10:42 PM] earthforged#0000
that leaves me 75 spaced


[25-Nov-24 10:42 PM] earthforged#0000
w ait


[25-Nov-24 10:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no just 2 STO


[25-Nov-24 10:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
anymore isn't really worth


[25-Nov-24 10:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
since they don't make you money


[25-Nov-24 10:44 PM] earthforged#0000
8HB1..2STO..4EXT..10SME.   leaves 95 spaces


[25-Nov-24 10:47 PM] earthforged#0000
i can fill out SMEs and keep them churning..but if i randomly buy to much ores will go up in price


[25-Nov-24 10:47 PM] earthforged#0000
i need time to work out contracts


[25-Nov-24 10:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Do 9HB1 2STO 5EXT and 12SME? leaves 26 space


[25-Nov-24 10:48 PM] earthforged#0000
right on..


[25-Nov-24 10:48 PM] earthforged#0000
then upgrade hq..bigger ships and grow


[25-Nov-24 10:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
exactly


[25-Nov-24 10:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well your second base's permit is free


[25-Nov-24 10:49 PM] earthforged#0000
upgrading hq gives me mettalurgy bonuses


[25-Nov-24 10:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yeah it can


[25-Nov-24 10:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well if you are happy with that plan. I am happy to give you a grant


[25-Nov-24 10:54 PM] earthforged#0000
i am. im ready to wheel and deal and make some contracts for those that need


[25-Nov-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ok sent the cont


[25-Nov-24 10:57 PM] earthforged#0000
its going to take a LOT of flying to get that built lol

[25-Nov-24 10:59 PM] earthforged#0000

Oh I sell building materials cheaper than what is listed on the CX if you want or need and I could help you get BBH,BTA,BSE, and BDE to Deimos


[25-Nov-24 11:14 PM] earthforged#0000
alright..when i get up in the morning ill make the list

{Reactions}

[25-Nov-24 11:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and I can take those to Deimos at no cost bc I'll be taking some stuff there tomorrow anyways


[25-Nov-24 11:15 PM] earthforged#0000
ok..you see the list of what im building


[25-Nov-24 11:16 PM] earthforged#0000
i can do the math if you need.  give me a few


[25-Nov-24 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
are you using prunplanner by any chance?


[25-Nov-24 11:16 PM] earthforged#0000

[26-Nov-24 12:07 AM] earthforged#0000
im sure its right


[26-Nov-24 08:53 AM] earthforged#0000
so which channel to work out trade deals?


[26-Nov-24 08:55 AM] earthforged#0000
im going to stick with base 1 for now while i get the machine working


[26-Nov-24 09:08 AM] realharvey#0000
You can have a look at #internal-requests . In this channel people post what they are looking for. But you could also just ask in #trading if someone is looking for a steady supplier


[26-Nov-24 09:26 AM] jvaler#0000
for *working out* trade deals, use #trading 
for just advertising what you're looking for use the other channels


[26-Nov-24 10:13 AM] earthforged#0000
im going ahead and buying a bunch on market. whenever you are about ill give you a list of whats left


[26-Nov-24 11:27 AM] iwooden#0000
Any feedback on this plan? https://prunplanner.org/shared/13b702b9-29db-4469-9035-3a33433bad76

Sticking with my metallurgist start for now rather than branching out. It's not as profitable as just stacking 20x SME, but trying to bring down the amount of inputs I have to ship in per day (although building RIGs for the H20 just doesn't seem worth it)

[26-Nov-24 11:28 AM] laaxus#0000
I honestly would just stick to 20 sme


[26-Nov-24 11:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would at least drop the INC and FRM


[26-Nov-24 11:29 AM] laaxus#0000
@evov  might buy your whole production on site


[26-Nov-24 11:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
With plans to drop the rest of the EXT and COL eventually


[26-Nov-24 11:29 AM] iwooden#0000
Okay yeah, I see C being sold on the LM for a decent price so I can probably drop those


[26-Nov-24 11:30 AM] laaxus#0000
I would never have col


[26-Nov-24 11:30 AM] laaxus#0000
ext + sme is acceptable


[26-Nov-24 11:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
O is slightly lighter than ALO is


[26-Nov-24 11:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
For what it’s worth


[26-Nov-24 11:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho the most valuable things you will produce will come from your SME


[26-Nov-24 11:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc those get boosted the most by the efficiency effects


[26-Nov-24 11:37 AM] jcheung#0000
splitting your experts 3 ways is a bad idea, not to mention how poor the yield of O is

It is a good start ☺️


[26-Nov-24 11:42 AM] iwooden#0000
Yeah I only start with the 2 in metallurgy, looks like I get another one in ~2 months if I'm reading the docs correctly

no, you should have all 5 in 2 months with a full metallurgy base

[26-Nov-24 11:43 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe like a month and a half

using the auto-housing option in prunplanner is nice


[26-Nov-24 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
pain in the butt if you want to run at a slight deficit though


[26-Nov-24 11:44 AM] iwooden#0000
I use that yeah, but my current understanding is that if you're using, say, 940/1000 pioneers, the "idle" workers still consume basic resources, right?


[26-Nov-24 11:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
No


[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] iwooden#0000
Ohooo nice, alright. Guess they have to fend for their own food if they're not on the smelting line, then


[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Er well


[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
if you have one single building

only the amount that can actually be employed will show up/be assigned to you

[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
you're not gonna have one single SME are you?


[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
so there are no idle workers


[26-Nov-24 11:45 AM] iwooden#0000
Yeah I was just thinking that, now it makes sense


[26-Nov-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
re PIO
you do kinda want to minimize open slots, but only because housing costs resources and base space


[26-Nov-24 11:47 AM] iwooden#0000
Just updated the plan, up to 14 SME with the difference made up by EXTs, though I can be convinced to just go 20 SME and do more shipping


[26-Nov-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
starting off exts are not a bad idea


[26-Nov-24 11:47 AM] iwooden#0000
Think the link should just refer to the updated version if I saved it right


[26-Nov-24 11:47 AM] iwooden#0000
Thanks, that clarifies things


[26-Nov-24 11:49 AM] iwooden#0000
...and bumped up the metallurgist expert count to 5, more accurate for the long-term


[26-Nov-24 11:51 AM] iwooden#0000
A competing plan I had was to just make basic consumables: https://prunplanner.org/shared/8bb46228-1841-424a-b39d-03d55118b31d , but I like the "flavor" of being a smelting magnate more lol

In any case, let me know if there's more work I should do to apply for the grant program - I'm also fine if the answer is just "give it a week or two" considering I started yesterday. 😉  Appreciate y'all taking the time to look at the plans!


[26-Nov-24 12:11 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I started as on Deimos with a mixed EXT/SME base. It was more profitable, when I started, to produce the ALO youself, then importing it.

The best way to check how your setup compares to other ones (at least in the beginning, before you understand more deeply why), is to create multiple plans in PrunPlanner and compare the profit/day and ROI values.


[26-Nov-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can’t send a CONT for the grant rn tho


[26-Nov-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Hello, I started a manufacturing company on phobos 22 days ago, currently have a pp mk1, smelter that makes silicon, extractor and a bmp. I'm currently getting money for an electronics device manufacturing to start making multi purpose scanners. Could use free money and some guidance 🙏

have you used Prun Planner?


[19-Dec-24 08:31 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
no because im playing this with a friend thats better at this stuff, refuses to buy a license and get a grant and does all the spreadsheet stuff manually


[19-Dec-24 08:42 AM] finestone#0000
Nothing wrong with doing the spreadsheets manually i would check out Prun Planner tho very helpful in testing out your base builds and sharing.


[19-Dec-24 08:43 AM] finestone#0000
As far as SCN goes its a good one CU could be a problem though


[19-Dec-24 08:43 AM] finestone#0000
Phobos is a ELE planet so in the long run you would want to move your manufactoring and mettalurgy to respective planets


[19-Dec-24 08:49 AM] finestone#0000
Mining the SIO is fine dont mine FEO as its not worth it on that planet (negative returns). A good question is which SI recipe are you using?

[19-Dec-24 08:51 AM] finestone#0000
The 2nd picture is on a metallurgy planet with experts you can see how much of a difference it makes! Hence why smelting on phobos is not ideal.


[19-Dec-24 08:58 AM] finestone#0000
These pictures are from prun planner which is another reason i reccomend checking it out!


[19-Dec-24 10:06 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
yeah its about time i get to checking it out


[19-Dec-24 10:10 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
im using the alluminum recipe


[19-Dec-24 10:12 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
but it would be acceptable for a starting base right ? or have i just started off wrong


[19-Dec-24 10:13 AM] finestone#0000
As long as your making money which picture 1 shows you are then you havnt made a mistake


[19-Dec-24 10:14 AM] finestone#0000
Simply about optimatizion moving forward and with an AGP grant you should have enough funds to create a somewhat optimitzed base


[19-Dec-24 10:17 AM] finestone#0000
For metallurgy i would recommend Deimos, Manufacturing: Hephaestus Construction either Nike or Aceland


[19-Dec-24 10:18 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
i guess thats right lol


[19-Dec-24 10:18 AM] finestone#0000
If you want to full build phobos off COGC that is fine too in the short term I think FP making DW is actually quite profitibale atm.


[19-Dec-24 10:19 AM] finestone#0000
At the end of the day you just need to present a profitable plan to a grant giver


[19-Dec-24 10:19 AM] 8082i4gor#0000

[19-Dec-24 10:21 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
think you could help me pull a plan together?


[19-Dec-24 10:21 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
or give me a better idea of how it would look like, if i wanted to do ele on phobos and metallurgy on deimos


[19-Dec-24 10:22 AM] finestone#0000
I think you would suprise yourself with Prun Planner. Planet search > Phobos > Create Base > Add the buildings and infrastructure to create a full 500/500 base

Hey I joined the game a little while ago and I just got the pro license, I had heard about the grant and I was wondering if I could get some money, I'm currently trying to spec a little into software and those components are not treating my bank account too nicely


[20-Dec-24 12:28 PM] getonthetrain#0000
Make a plan in prunplanner and if it makes sense you should be good


[20-Dec-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
software? can you be a little more specific


[20-Dec-24 01:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I try to keep bids open on most of the SD produced software items. If you have some on ANT you can't sell and I don't have bids, I may have simply forgotten. LD is pretty reliable and I think it has the highest bids per production time.


[20-Dec-24 03:51 PM] taxevader69#0000
I did some rough calculations in excel and I should be fine because most of the technician software doesn’t need any inputs so it’s free products and the inputs to the engineer software aren’t too expensive just the building materials and the upkeep for them can be a little expensive


[20-Dec-24 03:51 PM] taxevader69#0000
I’m going to give the planner a go though

[21-Dec-24 06:41 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Hi.  I just started as a carbon farmer on Harmonia.  I'm looking for a grant to extend into PE production, by getting Hydrogen from ZV-759G.

ZV-759G: (686k AIC) https://prunplanner.org/shared/ac9aabb3-eaa3-4b85-8d5a-481d2fabf4d6

Harmonia, after expansion from grant (expansion requires 175k AIC):
 https://prunplanner.org/shared/e2c488eb-92d6-4baf-8880-b5486b38d09f

[Later today this planet will be CM, 3xHB1, 1xFP, 3xFRM, 1xINC, 1xRIG, 3xHB1]

Appears to generate about 10k AIC/day in PE and 15k AIC/day in other leftover stuff (mostly H and some agriculture products), so certainly could be optimized a bit more over time as it grows.

Thoughts I've already had:
- This is self sufficient for non luxury consumables except for OVE.  Benefits of a farm planet.  Might be worth it to use some luxury consumables on the gas giant.
- The temperature of ZV-759G makes the base construction pricy.
- There's basically a circular shipping route from AI1 -> Harmonia -> ZV-759G, which seems convenient.
- Leaves about 140k of the grant for contingencies.
- I've placed some guesses about where the experts will line up.
- I know that doing the manufacturing of the PE on ZV probably isn't ideal, so as I grow and gain shipping capacity, I'd expect to move that to another base).
- Expected repair costs seem to be about 8-10 days of every 90 days of profit, though it is more if I only count the PE output.
- Fuel might be an issue, since getting in and out of ZV-759G chews up a lot of STL fuel even with close to minimum usage, though this depends a bit on frequency.
- Could reduce costs some by launching fewer collectors on the gas giant initially, but long term it seems like I'd be exporting H from there anyway, so might as well get started now (and there does seem to be some amount of demand for H at the CX).

Depending on when the grant would be approved, I might not be able to actually set this up for a few days due to the holidays.

Thoughts?

[21-Dec-24 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
H production requires a ton of shipping


[21-Dec-24 06:47 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
That's why I'm doing the manufacturing in place.


[21-Dec-24 06:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I think you try too much to be autonomous


[21-Dec-24 06:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Sometimes, it is more profitable to rely on the cx


[21-Dec-24 06:49 AM] laaxus#0000
Because others Can produce goods cheaper than you can


[21-Dec-24 06:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I am on mobile so I can't investigate much


[21-Dec-24 06:49 AM] laaxus#0000
But if you want to produce pe


[21-Dec-24 06:50 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend hephaestus


[21-Dec-24 06:51 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, I saw the base plan in #kevin-information , but that looked like it required significantly more shipping management since it was close to full loads every day (plus, just one base would be a noticable amount of all the CX H traffic).

Though, it is certainly more profitable if it can be kept fed.


[21-Dec-24 08:58 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Ok, having noodled on this a bit more, I see what you are saying.  I had a read through this: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/starting-in-antares/ from a pinned message which helped understand the situation a bit better.

The biggest thing I missed was that the fuel and transport time and to Hephastus from the CX is quite short compared to what I am used to on harmonia (duh).

So I think the only concern is if the hydrogen market supply can keep up or not.  And, if it can't, at least its not too many days of profit to open hydrogen production though clearly that's not a preferred outcome.

In any case a 1M grant doesn't appear to be able to cover a full 20 HB1 + 20 BMP up front, so I can start with 15 or 16 of each (800k-850k) and then grow over time, using the remainin 150k-200k to seed the input materials  Plan:  https://prunplanner.org/shared/97391f99-3ca5-4d81-a5c3-27564a90a484


[21-Dec-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
please don't underestimate the cost of keeping stock for input and consummables


[21-Dec-24 09:02 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
So you're saying, start with something more like 10/10 ?


[21-Dec-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
Out of 1M, I would spend 500k max on building, whatever needed in input and the rest as buffer


[21-Dec-24 09:03 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
10/10 it is then, let me adjust that


[21-Dec-24 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
and then slowly increase buildings


[21-Dec-24 09:03 AM] laaxus#0000
if you ever want to buy at bid and sell at ask, you need a buffer of money


[21-Dec-24 09:03 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
hmm, 10 is a bit too much, maybe 8.


[21-Dec-24 09:03 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
yeah


[21-Dec-24 09:04 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
ok, 8/8 is 499k


[21-Dec-24 09:05 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
inputs per day claim to be  about 50k


[21-Dec-24 09:05 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
and that's down to 80 hydrogen per day which has me worry about the market situation less.


[21-Dec-24 09:08 AM] laaxus#0000
for a pe base, this is a good plan


[21-Dec-24 09:09 AM] laaxus#0000
just a few question, why are you going into pe ?


[21-Dec-24 09:09 AM] laaxus#0000
just for profit, or do you have later plan ?


[21-Dec-24 09:12 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
So, I was looking at it already before I heard about the grant and came here, because of several aspects of harmonia that could have done it interated (ineffeciently, of course).

I was already carbon farming, there's low quality hydrogen on that planet, so I could have done a nice vertical integration in place.  Beyond the vertical integration on a small base, it was clear from the market that PE demand was significant so a small player could not worry about getting stuck.

But, obviously, the grant can change that approach dramatically and I wouldn't use that approach with the grant.

But, the main goal for the moment is certainly profit, I haven't looked further than PE for now.


[21-Dec-24 09:13 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
But, possible  next goals would be to use the profit towards a third ship, or either up the chain or down the chain (e.g. Hydrogen) to support the PE production.


[21-Dec-24 09:14 AM] laaxus#0000
another advice : always set your experts to 5, as you'll reach that eventually


[21-Dec-24 09:14 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
yeah, done.


[21-Dec-24 09:14 AM] laaxus#0000
building vertical on a single base is bad most of the time,


[21-Dec-24 09:14 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok for a first base, but avoid that in the future


[21-Dec-24 09:14 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, like I said, the grant means I'm not stuck on one planet.  That was just why I was looking at PE to begin with.  (e.g. "what uses carbon?")


[21-Dec-24 09:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm sorry, I'm quite sick, so I'm probably repeating myself or missing something you already said


[21-Dec-24 09:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend testing those base in prunplanner before making a decision

[21-Dec-24 09:15 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Oh, no problem.  The grant proram feels very generous to a new player, and this discussion has also been useful.


[21-Dec-24 09:16 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
As was the intro to pruplanner. I've done like 5 possible setups since finding it last night.


[21-Dec-24 09:17 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
> it's ok for a first base, but avoid that in the future

My guilty conscience does feel like saying I expect to do some playing around with Harmonia still but I'll keep this advice in mind, and it doesn't affect how I'd approach the PE line on Heph..


[21-Dec-24 09:18 AM] laaxus#0000
The best advice I like to give is to make a prunplanner base for each building in optimal setup, this really gives you an idea of what's profitable, what isn't, what is a potential good idea etc


[21-Dec-24 09:18 AM] laaxus#0000
it takes time but it's really worthwhile


[21-Dec-24 09:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
indeed.


[21-Dec-24 09:19 AM] laaxus#0000
another advice I like to give is to setup cx setting in prunplanner as "buy at ask, sell at bid"


[21-Dec-24 09:19 AM] laaxus#0000
because the worst case scenario is not selling your production


[21-Dec-24 09:19 AM] laaxus#0000
having the security of always being able to get a profit even when selling at bid, is really valuable in itself


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
almost everybody once overproduced a product, and couldn't sell it


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah.  I didn't quite see how to do that at first, I think it means set the CX preferences to be SELL at AI1 BUY and BUY ant AI1 SELL ?


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
exact


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
no


[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000

[21-Dec-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
buy at ask, sell at bid

ok, I've checked a few things in the plan and convinced myself I have the correct CX settings to rely on bids and asks for the appropriate operations.

[21-Dec-24 09:28 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Construction costs did go up to 556k though but I think that might be close enough.


[21-Dec-24 09:29 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
58k per day of supply to start.


[21-Dec-24 09:30 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
well, less since I don't start with 5 experts, so the ramp is slightly cheaper until they arrive


[21-Dec-24 09:31 AM] laaxus#0000
Once you did those bases in prunplanner, and you're convinced of your choice for the base you desire, I'll give you the grant


[21-Dec-24 09:31 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I... think I am convicned?  The plan is the one you've been looking at.


[21-Dec-24 09:31 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
If you think I'm better off starting at 7/7 I can do that too I guess.


[21-Dec-24 09:31 AM] laaxus#0000
it's not a matter of the pe base, I think 8/8 is fine


[21-Dec-24 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
but just a matter of "which base is the most profitable"


[21-Dec-24 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
this is a question you need to ask yourself


[21-Dec-24 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
because profitability depends on your value


[21-Dec-24 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I like High risk High reward gameplay


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
Others like stability, slow but steady, gameplay


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
oh, you mean build all of these plus the one I have in prunplanner first?  https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1254643011980234863/1320047077975130213


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
so I can't tell you which base is best


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, make a base for them


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't need to add them to your empire


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
but jsut to have the base saved, mean you can look it up later on with one click


[21-Dec-24 09:33 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
well, I do to assign them a CX, don't I?  I have a different empire for each test.

[21-Dec-24 09:34 AM] laaxus#0000
that's all the base I have saved in PP


[21-Dec-24 09:34 AM] laaxus#0000
but only use a few of them in my empire


[21-Dec-24 09:35 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm missing something about the things in that description.  They seem to be taking about buildings not products.


[21-Dec-24 09:35 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
so, if I made a pp2 base, what would I be desining it to build for the test?


[21-Dec-24 09:36 AM] laaxus#0000
Well, you'd need to decide which planet to build it on


[21-Dec-24 09:36 AM] laaxus#0000
ideal case is 3 green close to cx, with the associated cogc


[21-Dec-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
PP2 is a construction building


[21-Dec-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
so you want to build it on a construction planet


[21-Dec-24 09:37 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
No, I mean, to compare with my PE setup, what would I tell the PP2s to build?


[21-Dec-24 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
so go on the search tab, filter by construction, set the distance to ANT less than 5, and then look at the planet


[21-Dec-24 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
depends on your gameplay


[21-Dec-24 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
you could either always do the most profitable recipe and adapt to the market


[21-Dec-24 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
or always build Lfabs in set proportion (1 LBH/LDE/LTA for example)


[21-Dec-24 09:40 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Hmmm.


[21-Dec-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, the question is : you have those 2 base, it's up to you to decide which one is better
You should take account of :
1) how much shipping is required
2) how sure you are to be able to sell your production
3) how unstable is the market of your input goods


[21-Dec-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
for example, I smelt LI on deimos


[21-Dec-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
but the market look like this for LIO

[21-Dec-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
so yeah


[21-Dec-24 09:42 AM] laaxus#0000
I gonna have to change recipe at some point (aka this week, once I run out of stock)


[21-Dec-24 09:50 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
ok, this feels like a sort of exponential amount of exploration to do before settling on a base though, since I need to test for potentially many different products in each of those 5 options.

I do like the fact that Heph has low transport times.


[21-Dec-24 09:51 AM] laaxus#0000
it truly helps at the start (the low transport time of hepha)


[21-Dec-24 09:51 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm not saying PE base is a bad idea tho, don't misunderstand


[21-Dec-24 09:53 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Mostly I'm trying to understand what you're asking me to do.  I'll poke at a few options but I don't think I'll do many products at each of those 5 locations.


[21-Dec-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
don't force yourself


[21-Dec-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
that being a chore is not the point

I just don't want you to regret your choice later on


[21-Dec-24 09:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
if you'll be around for a bit I'll poke first, but if you're running off I'm pretty happy with the PE base now.


[21-Dec-24 09:55 AM] laaxus#0000
I'll be online for the next hour or so before I go eating


[21-Dec-24 09:57 AM] realharvey#0000
Construction bases might appear more profitable but it also requires way more shipping.  For a beginner I advise to focus on bases with low shipping :)


[21-Dec-24 09:57 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I had been interpreting Laaxus's advice thus far to be avoid bases that don't require shipping because vertical integration is less profitable.


[21-Dec-24 09:58 AM] laaxus#0000
This screen might be the most important one in PP, make sure to use it well

Ok, so for the POL on Elon example, you wouldn't extract the MGS locally to generate PG?

yes


[21-Dec-24 10:05 AM] realharvey#0000

[21-Dec-24 10:06 AM] realharvey#0000
there are a few quite heavy products where on site extraction makes sense


[21-Dec-24 10:08 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
how much should I be concerned about market saturation?  For example, is it an issue if I supply or demand, say, 5%-10% of the traded volume per day?


[21-Dec-24 10:09 AM] laaxus#0000
the best way to look at it is the amount of bid (imo)


[21-Dec-24 10:09 AM] laaxus#0000
how much time would it take for you to fill all the profitable bid ?


[21-Dec-24 10:10 AM] laaxus#0000
use the CXM cmd


[21-Dec-24 10:10 AM] laaxus#0000
look at the bid in ANT but also the other market


[21-Dec-24 10:24 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
ok, I've poked around a bit.

The only case that looked on its face more profitable per day than PE at Heph was PP2 generating LDE at nike, but the market looked slim (though, I guess as you said you can swap around to other L** outputs).

PG (via POL) and CL(+NA)  (via CHP) at Elon were both ok, but weren't as good and took more shipping (distance+time, not weight/volume).

So, I think I'm good going with BMPs doing PE on Heph for now.  I like that the shipping distance is short which keeps my ship available for shipping contracts, and BMPs can also switch over to other in-demand products pretty easily if needed.


[21-Dec-24 10:26 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000

Alright so I played around with the planner and came up with a metallurgy base on deimos (https://prunplanner.org/shared/6e4793bc-07bb-44aa-b5d1-9a3dc05620e6), after all the expenses id have a buffer of 80k. Id use the profits from that base on an electronics base on phobos. I got it all planned out aswell (https://prunplanner.org/shared/81e31db5-7819-45ba-94e0-b5c7e40f95ae)

thoughts?


[21-Dec-24 04:54 PM] tanda#0000
I would personally recommend not running INC on Deimos. Carbon is pretty stable right now and running buildings off COGC generally reduces profit.
FS outputs are honestly really unreliable on the CX currently. I personally run some FS and was strongly considering getting rid of them due to how slow the outputs were selling, At least until I started contributing to specific projects.


[21-Dec-24 04:57 PM] tanda#0000
Also, 90% of the time you're going to want to use the luxury items for pops. It improves outputs considerably.
I would recommend taking a look at the experts down on the bottom left. You will eventually hit 5 experts for metallurgy on Deimos, and for electronics on Phobos with these builds. You may as well account for the shipping and resource demands they will entail


[21-Dec-24 05:10 PM] tanda#0000
If you want to build things like connectors, it would be best to shop around for someone to buy them from you. Also I would plan on smelting RGO/BGO on site through your FS. These inputs are really heavy, and also somewhat unavailable on market. If you import AUO, smelt AU on site, then process it into RGO/BGO it solves a lot of your problems


[21-Dec-24 05:12 PM] tanda#0000
Speaking of. Watch your import/export when you make bases:

This is going to be very dicey with just two starter ships


[21-Dec-24 05:23 PM] igfloz#0000
Everything Tanda has mentioned is very relevant. My 1st impression when I looked at your plans was "jeez, keeping 8 FS supplied is gonna burn your 80K buffer straight away" - As Tanda mentioned, add Lux 1 and Lux 2 items - and also, just take moment and look at what your DW and RAT needs are per day, this is going to cost money !

Laxxus and Sanitycat were having a good conversation in this channel earlier today about starting a 1st base. A lot of what was discussed will apply to your decisions also. I recommend scrolling back a few hours and reading through 🙂

Alright, thank you everyone for the help! Turns out I havent updated my cx setting before making the base plans. I also mistaked pe's supply and demand with BCO's 💀 , so I came up with another plan for deimos. (https://prunplanner.org/shared/6e4793bc-07bb-44aa-b5d1-9a3dc05620e6) The plan leaves me with 200 area for further expansion and a buffer of 200k. I havent included luxury consumables or experts because i think the baseline should be the ideal expectation, than planning for always the most ideal circumstances. I will still be using luxury consumables ofc. I would produce RG until its not longer profitable (current approx is 2 weeks if no more orders come in), then GL without the sensor recipe (wont last very long, not a great market, then Id be going to NG.

[23-Dec-24 03:49 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
I still went with deimos in antares II because it calculates higher profit rather than building a base on eos that would have shorter flight times without jumping between systems but less profit.


[23-Dec-24 04:36 AM] jcheung#0000
if you really want to make RG, i suggest considering making GL as well


[23-Dec-24 04:37 AM] jcheung#0000
also what's your plan to source AUO?


[23-Dec-24 07:27 AM] tanda#0000
I would personally recommend something like this. I overproduce gold myself, and it can be very slow to move. It's also unbelievably heavy after smelting (part of why I process it into RGO and then HCC on site without moving it again). SI is in a pretty good place right now, you can expect to get some movement there. 
I highly recommend smelting your own GL. GL is more expensive than it appears at first, and this base will cost you roughly 180k per week just in GL to run it.

[23-Dec-24 07:27 AM] tanda#0000
man, I miss the days I could honestly recommend an AL base


[23-Dec-24 07:29 AM] tanda#0000
Oh, and make sure you add on a STO on the left hand side. Each STO gives your base another 5k tons and 5k m3 to work with. It'll keep you sane (logisitically speaking)


[23-Dec-24 07:33 AM] tanda#0000
And again, make sure you're using experts in your calculation. It's not about profit so much, it's about tonnage and space. The above base requires one of your starter ships to export from it every day (which is doable). Looking at how the experts change the base will help keep you from struggling down the road.


[23-Dec-24 07:33 AM] tanda#0000
A full base will hit 5th expert in 2 months, so it will happen, and probably sooner than you're ready to upgrade your ships


[23-Dec-24 02:33 PM] 8082i4gor#0000
when i make gl it actually decreases profit and increases tonnage with experts set both on 0 and 5 and in both types of cx managments. i have my cx managment set to buy and sell rather than average and came up with different prices than on your screenshot but when i set it on average it matched the prices, whats the benefit of using an average over more accurate prices right now?


[23-Dec-24 02:33 PM] 8082i4gor#0000
cuz i set it like on the screenshot


[23-Dec-24 02:34 PM] 8082i4gor#0000
from the cx


[23-Dec-24 02:35 PM] tanda#0000
I have mine set to average to help make long term decisions. I would pay attention to market volume above everything else right now. Check out CXPC GL.AI1 to give you an idea of how much moves


[23-Dec-24 02:54 PM] 8082i4gor#0000
GL is more dependable so ill make RG on the side same with the silicon and gold. if trends change theres versatility to change


[23-Dec-24 05:33 PM] jcheung#0000
oops, ignore that


[23-Dec-24 05:33 PM] jcheung#0000
the reason GL makes you "less" is because your final output in the end of RG decreases. that said, RG sells so slowly at ask


[23-Dec-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
also while avg has its merits, buying at buy and selling at sell has some too


[23-Dec-24 05:37 PM] jcheung#0000
avg is good for longer term, buy high / sell low is good for short term


[23-Dec-24 05:37 PM] jcheung#0000
ideally, you look at *both* numbers *and* `cxpc`


[23-Dec-24 05:56 PM] finestone#0000
I would look at selling to bids early

Yeah, selling to bids means your money moves faster, which with the limited supply us new players have is... very useful.  (It also means you can, for example, bring oyur ship to the cx, sell your product, and use that cash to buy the next round of inputs to ship back out).


[24-Dec-24 04:17 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
theres a large demand for steel compared to supply. Instead of gold, i think steel is good to make with silicon, its less tonnage and space, with higher profit than just steel when you make silicon with it (1 STL/3SIL with 4 SME). While producing glass, RG is produced with it, so when the small amount of orders are fulfilled, I am still producing GL and can use that reliably. This way, I can get as much short term profit I can so I can build my buffer. I want to use most of the original buffer to buy input ahead of time, so once I develop enough profit, I can start making orders and transition toward the average price, which would be more desirable in the long run. I originally had 5 GFs, but the construction prices in the current market were way too high. So, in the meantime, I removed one. Later on, I intend to build it back once im comfortable with what im doing. 

So, we are looking at (AVG market):
4 GF running GL and 4 SME running 1 STL 3 SI:
48k / 451.7t; 60.3k/day input

4 GF running GL and RG and 4 SME running 1 STL 3 SI:
56k / 419t; 64.4k/day input

Current Market:
4 GF running GL and 4 SME running 1 STL 3 SI:
33.6k / 451t; 70.35k/day input

4 GF running GL and RG and 4 SME running 1 STL 3 SI:
43k / 420t; 73k/day input

Current prices to construct base: 
1x 700k construction (ouch)
3x 73k input
Total: 919k, 81k buffer

Please let me know if im overlooking anything, this is with the experts and lux items. I want to make sure im doing this right, and this is my first time playing this type of game of this depth, and im enjoying the learning. If theres any reoccurring mistakes, im trying to learn, and maybe im not analyzing correctly. You all have been a lot of help and very informative, I appreciate everyone that has helped me! ❤️

for STL, be wary of the weigh of FE


[25-Dec-24 02:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The average includes sales made with ask and bid orders, representing a price people actually agreed upon. 
Sometimes people park there wares as bids or ask for ridiculous prices. Those will sit there and set a high price, tho nobody will buy for that. This might lead to wrong assumptions on your side.
Tho, this is mostly true for unsaturated markets. It will be less of a problem for e.g DW or PWO

here is my plan to make a big RAT base to start off

[25-Dec-24 02:46 PM] o.pie#0000
but I could also make half a RAT base and half a basic prefabs base


[25-Dec-24 02:47 PM] o.pie#0000
i played this game two years ago


[25-Dec-24 02:47 PM] o.pie#0000
as i recall, after making 5 or so bases, the limiting factor was shipping capacity


[25-Dec-24 02:48 PM] tanda#0000
It is if you stay FREE/Basic, but you've already crossed that bridge


[25-Dec-24 02:48 PM] tanda#0000
RAT is always a good idea, but current market makes DW insanely expensive right now


[25-Dec-24 02:48 PM] o.pie#0000
oh yeah


[25-Dec-24 02:49 PM] o.pie#0000
i could do a DW base as well


[25-Dec-24 02:49 PM] o.pie#0000
where is the water planet in Antares


[25-Dec-24 02:49 PM] tanda#0000
so that's probably my only critique is to go a bit heavier towards DW for the moment. FPs are versatile and can easily swap back


[25-Dec-24 02:49 PM] tanda#0000
it's SE-110c Ice Station Alpha


[25-Dec-24 02:50 PM] tanda#0000
water is in good supply and cheap, something I've recommended a couple of times is to set up a DW only base on Phobos


[25-Dec-24 02:50 PM] tanda#0000
even off COGC it still turns over about 100k profit a day with current prices


[25-Dec-24 02:50 PM] tanda#0000
and can make bank even buying off the cX


[25-Dec-24 02:56 PM] o.pie#0000
ok one sec


[25-Dec-24 03:11 PM] o.pie#0000
phobos base

[26-Dec-24 09:09 AM] jcheung#0000
probably wait for someone to accept you-may take a little bit because of holidays


[26-Dec-24 09:28 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm having trouble understanding these numbers


[26-Dec-24 09:29 AM] jvaler#0000
60.3k/d input? is that saying that's running costs? what about profit/d?


[26-Dec-24 09:29 AM] jvaler#0000
the tonnage numbers look out of context too... 48k / 451.7t?


[26-Dec-24 09:30 AM] jvaler#0000
and what prunplanner CX settings were these calculated with?


[26-Dec-24 09:37 PM] 8082i4gor#0000
Yes, im sorry, I shouldve been more clear. I have 2 cx settings posted, one for the current market prices at the time and one for average so theres a long term outlook on it. I listed whats being made, and then the numbers below each are profits/d, tonnage/d, and input costs/d (including workforce inputs and lux items).

So for example:
4 GF running GL and RG and 4 SME running 1 STL 3 SI:
(Profit/d:) 56k / (Tonnage/d:) 419t; (Workforce & production input/d:) 64.4k/day


[27-Dec-24 04:43 AM] jvaler#0000
okay these look like crazy good profits for this few buildings... i'm worried that the market for these items are temporary as they're historically more thinly traded, but i'll tenatively send you the grant for this. you seem to have a good grasp on the rest of the mechanics of the game


[27-Dec-24 04:44 AM] jvaler#0000
sent you a cont


[27-Dec-24 04:55 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
Thank you very much!


[27-Dec-24 04:59 AM] jvaler#0000
btw "average" setting isn't actually average, it's just last traded price. for average you need to use the pp7davg setting


[27-Dec-24 05:03 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
bruh


[27-Dec-24 05:03 AM] 8082i4gor#0000
well, thats good to know


[27-Dec-24 05:06 AM] jvaler#0000
it's stupid lol


[27-Dec-24 05:06 AM] jvaler#0000
i was shocked when i found out the ingame "average" was useless


[08-Jan-25 12:31 AM] jvaler#0000
@altf4forbetterlife looking at your prunplanner link, looks alright to me


[08-Jan-25 12:31 AM] jvaler#0000
though why GC?


[08-Jan-25 12:31 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
well planner says it the most profitable atm


[08-Jan-25 12:31 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
besides some further industry can be applied based on GC


[08-Jan-25 12:32 AM] jvaler#0000
hm..

[08-Jan-25 12:33 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
most profitable with AL which is my base job I may say ?


[08-Jan-25 12:33 AM] jvaler#0000
you can't sell GC at that volume though, barely anyone buys it. if someone has the means to produce HMS they're most likely just going to produce the GC themselves

I haven't done any deep inquiry and paperwork cause everthing happens a little fast to me today :), give me some time and I'll have a more reasonable plan

thx for helping out


[08-Jan-25 12:37 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah ofc, it takes a bit of time to research stuff in this game


[08-Jan-25 12:37 AM] jvaler#0000
didn't expect a plan right away =P

focus on producing HMS & TRU atm, materials like C/H/HE/PG need be bought from market, will extend bases to produce them later in game


[08-Jan-25 01:22 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
is this plan ok for grant ?


[08-Jan-25 01:23 AM] finestone#0000
So step 1 make sure to mark Luxury good upkeep


[08-Jan-25 01:23 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok done


[08-Jan-25 01:23 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
50k profit/day


[08-Jan-25 01:23 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
cool


[08-Jan-25 01:23 AM] finestone#0000
there is very few reason you wouldnt use them


[08-Jan-25 01:24 AM] finestone#0000
they would have to be outragously priced


[08-Jan-25 01:24 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
currently it's profitable using them according to prun


[08-Jan-25 01:26 AM] finestone#0000
HMS is a good one as its a consumable so i like that you have come to that however you are running 4 different Industries


[08-Jan-25 01:27 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
well yeah actually that's the only product which needs are a lot and relevant to AL


[08-Jan-25 01:27 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
cross-indy is a problem though


[08-Jan-25 01:28 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
anything I can do to improve this situation


[08-Jan-25 01:28 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
?


[08-Jan-25 01:29 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
or I think it's better for me to focus on HMS and delete the TRU part


[08-Jan-25 01:30 AM] finestone#0000
So here are my thoughts


[08-Jan-25 01:30 AM] finestone#0000
1 IND is not going to be consistent enough


[08-Jan-25 01:31 AM] finestone#0000
for you as a player to comfortably setup HMS production


[08-Jan-25 01:31 AM] finestone#0000
HE i didnt know about looked into and it seems fine


[08-Jan-25 01:31 AM] finestone#0000
generally you only want to build the COGC buildings and maybe an EXT/RIG/COL


[08-Jan-25 01:33 AM] finestone#0000
The only reason you would off COGC is for a shipping reasons and that you are accepting that inefficiency


[08-Jan-25 01:34 AM] finestone#0000
that being said


[08-Jan-25 01:34 AM] finestone#0000
I dont hate the WEL


[08-Jan-25 01:34 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok give me a sec to absorb that info


[08-Jan-25 01:34 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
what kind of COGC can boost WEL ?


[08-Jan-25 01:35 AM] finestone#0000
that was my next point


[08-Jan-25 01:35 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok great


[08-Jan-25 01:35 AM] finestone#0000
later on i think this could be a good chain


[08-Jan-25 01:35 AM] finestone#0000
but you would want 4 planets for the COGCS

[08-Jan-25 01:36 AM] finestone#0000
to see what the Building COGC is you look at the Expertise


[08-Jan-25 01:36 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I'm with u now


[08-Jan-25 01:36 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
pls go on


[08-Jan-25 01:36 AM] finestone#0000
So welding plants *should* go on a Construction planet


[08-Jan-25 01:37 AM] finestone#0000
the reason is 25% is alot and you are going to struggle to make profits as markets get tighter margins


[08-Jan-25 01:37 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah I agree that


[08-Jan-25 01:37 AM] finestone#0000
CLF is manufactoring


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so for each part of HMS chain, I'm recommended to find corresponding COGC to do it


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] finestone#0000
correct


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] finestone#0000
IND is chemicals etc


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] finestone#0000
now that being said


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] finestone#0000
if the market is suffienct you can supply via market


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
how much is it to set up a blank base on a new planet approximately ?


[08-Jan-25 01:38 AM] finestone#0000
but as a new player IND is too low volume


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] finestone#0000
you cant put large buy orders in to attract people to make IND for you


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] finestone#0000
if the market dries up does that make sense?


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah I agree


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] finestone#0000
you have to Buy goods then sell goods early on


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] finestone#0000
so ideally you want to fill BID orders


[08-Jan-25 01:39 AM] finestone#0000
or sell things with very high daily volume


[08-Jan-25 01:40 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I think HMS matches that requirement ?


[08-Jan-25 01:40 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
as a basic consumable


[08-Jan-25 01:41 AM] finestone#0000
most consumables are good for that reason yes i would say the market is not as great compared to say RAT or DW tho


[08-Jan-25 01:41 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
that's for sure, RAT and DW is basic of basic 🙂


[08-Jan-25 01:41 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I mean


[08-Jan-25 01:41 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
too basic for profit, isn't it

[08-Jan-25 01:42 AM] finestone#0000
So to really view market health an easy way is 2 fold what is the spread as a percentage? and what is the 1d and 7 day AVG volume


[08-Jan-25 01:43 AM] finestone#0000
the Galaxy bought 7000 HMS last week


[08-Jan-25 01:43 AM] finestone#0000
AI1 was 1/7th of that


[08-Jan-25 01:43 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
moria is a beast


[08-Jan-25 01:44 AM] finestone#0000
and our spread is roughly 25%


[08-Jan-25 01:44 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
is it possible for me to ship HMS to NC1 to sell ?


[08-Jan-25 01:44 AM] finestone#0000
so if you were wanting to produce 2000 HMS weekly for AI1 that would probably not be ideal


[08-Jan-25 01:45 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
wow......hard for me to find a product that need AL 🥹


[08-Jan-25 01:45 AM] finestone#0000
as a new player i would not think about selling at other CXs


[08-Jan-25 01:45 AM] finestone#0000
only AI1 we just use all the markets to get a sense of market health


[08-Jan-25 01:46 AM] finestone#0000
well that is my next question is just selling the AL not what you are wanting?


[08-Jan-25 01:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes but you should not do that as a New player as it is risky

{Reactions}
👆 

[08-Jan-25 01:47 AM] laaxus#0000
Your first base should make money at no risk


[08-Jan-25 01:47 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
well both of you are correct


[08-Jan-25 01:47 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
looks like there is a big market potential for selling AL directly


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] finestone#0000
Selling AL is a good starter then build out your other planets would be a good plan


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
but wouldn't that turn my HQ base completely useless except a huge AL smelter ?


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Then once you have a riskless source of revenue, then you Can start taking risks


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] finestone#0000
HQ doesnt matter


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
alright then


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] finestone#0000
There is no bonus on your HQ


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Your first planet is deimos ?


[08-Jan-25 01:48 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so by doing this I can get rid of limit of "using AL" and start do other products


[08-Jan-25 01:49 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
Yeah I'm attracted by it's ALO yield 🙂


[08-Jan-25 01:49 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
any suggestions ? still able to COLIQ atm


[08-Jan-25 01:49 AM] finestone#0000
If your fine just selling AL do that


[08-Jan-25 01:50 AM] finestone#0000
if you really want to use it i would try selling GC


[08-Jan-25 01:50 AM] laaxus#0000
AL Will Always sell


[08-Jan-25 01:50 AM] finestone#0000
you can fill that bid at a profit and hopefully attract buyers


[08-Jan-25 01:50 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I guess I'll sell it


[08-Jan-25 01:50 AM] finestone#0000
there is a enough GC moving that you should be fine then eventually decon the WEL and move to a CON planet


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
but pls tell me if there is a better HQ planet


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
it's ok for me to move


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] finestone#0000
HQ doesnt matter


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] laaxus#0000
You Can move hq anytime


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] finestone#0000
all it does is give faction bonus


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] finestone#0000
which as Anateres is Electronics


[08-Jan-25 01:51 AM] finestone#0000
so it will be awhile before you use it


[08-Jan-25 01:52 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
no I mean if I COLIQ at another planet which can do more than produce AL I can save money for start another base n


[08-Jan-25 01:52 AM] finestone#0000
No deimos is a great planet


[08-Jan-25 01:52 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
alright then


[08-Jan-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
A good planet*


[08-Jan-25 01:53 AM] finestone#0000
I like your WEL idea tho also the TRU will always sell


[08-Jan-25 01:53 AM] finestone#0000
DO EXT, SME, WEL


[08-Jan-25 01:53 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't recommend that


[08-Jan-25 01:53 AM] finestone#0000
import HE, O, FEO, FLUX, C


[08-Jan-25 01:54 AM] laaxus#0000
As a starting player, to be able to sell your production at bid is a lifeline


[08-Jan-25 01:54 AM] finestone#0000
Export GC, TRU, AL


[08-Jan-25 01:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Being able to sell your AL at bid anytime, without loss of profit, is great


[08-Jan-25 01:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Tru production is riskier


[08-Jan-25 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes it will sell, but it might take Time to sell


[08-Jan-25 01:55 AM] finestone#0000
Im calc on selling to bid


[08-Jan-25 01:55 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
u mean directly export to market or export to another planet for further HMS production ?


[08-Jan-25 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
So I would recommend a mix of ext and SME


[08-Jan-25 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
That's what I started the game with


[08-Jan-25 01:56 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok so pure AL production according to Laaxus


[08-Jan-25 01:56 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm writing it down


[08-Jan-25 01:56 AM] finestone#0000
Pure AL production is fine and safe


[08-Jan-25 01:56 AM] finestone#0000
WEL is also profitable selling to bid


[08-Jan-25 01:57 AM] finestone#0000
so if you want to go that route you can as well


[08-Jan-25 01:57 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm thinking


[08-Jan-25 01:57 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
safe profit is attractive but after all, you need something that can lead you to a bigger company


[08-Jan-25 01:58 AM] finestone#0000
but eventually you would decon the WEL and move to CON planet


[08-Jan-25 01:58 AM] finestone#0000
so deimos would eventually be all SME anyways 🙂


[08-Jan-25 01:58 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
what is CON planet pls ?


[08-Jan-25 01:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah but there are very few bid order


[08-Jan-25 01:59 AM] laaxus#0000
It is so risky


[08-Jan-25 01:59 AM] laaxus#0000
And spread is enormous between ask and bid


[08-Jan-25 01:59 AM] finestone#0000
have 2 -4 welders is not risky


[08-Jan-25 01:59 AM] finestone#0000
he can make tons of cash from the AL and filling that GC bid


[08-Jan-25 02:00 AM] laaxus#0000
If you want to take a slightly riskier start, then do a FP base on phobos


[08-Jan-25 02:00 AM] laaxus#0000
At least you'll earn more money for that extra risk


[08-Jan-25 02:01 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I've made my final decision to start with pure AL, and do what F1NM said when I start having a healthy cash flow


[08-Jan-25 02:01 AM] laaxus#0000
It's not a Bad décision


[08-Jan-25 02:01 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so how can I get 1mil grant for more SME atm ?


[08-Jan-25 02:01 AM] laaxus#0000
A riskless cashflow is a lifeline


[08-Jan-25 02:02 AM] laaxus#0000
Hence why I also recommend to take a leased base if interested


[08-Jan-25 02:02 AM] laaxus#0000
But that's something you Can take a look on later


[08-Jan-25 02:02 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I'll have alook

You Can dm riseoffilth and ask him if he has an available base for you
I recommend him


[08-Jan-25 02:04 AM] finestone#0000
I dont reccomend doing leased bases


[08-Jan-25 02:04 AM] finestone#0000
BAse looks good however you will want 2-3 STO


[08-Jan-25 02:04 AM] finestone#0000
also you can have 5 experts when doing calcs


[08-Jan-25 02:04 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'll have a look for lease base but it is too early for me


[08-Jan-25 02:05 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok thx


[08-Jan-25 02:05 AM] finestone#0000
so metallurgy experts should be set to 5 extraction should be 1 (you can have 6 you could do 3/3 but the bonus gets better so 5-1 generally much better)


[08-Jan-25 02:05 AM] laaxus#0000
Why ?


[08-Jan-25 02:05 AM] finestone#0000
boring


[08-Jan-25 02:06 AM] finestone#0000
just build all IDC base and dont play the game?


[08-Jan-25 02:06 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I've updated it, slightly over 1mil but 70k profit/day


[08-Jan-25 02:06 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
looks perfect to me


[08-Jan-25 02:06 AM] laaxus#0000
I did the first Month to get an extra revenue riskless


[08-Jan-25 02:07 AM] laaxus#0000
It's not something you have to do forever


[08-Jan-25 02:07 AM] laaxus#0000
UP to him to décide if it's fun or not


[08-Jan-25 02:07 AM] finestone#0000
true i didnt say its bad


[08-Jan-25 02:07 AM] finestone#0000
i said i dont reccomend it


[08-Jan-25 02:08 AM] laaxus#0000
I personnaly like risky investment, but I can't do that without a riskless cashflow


[08-Jan-25 02:08 AM] finestone#0000
I dont think the fun of the game is (purely) just seeing line go up


[08-Jan-25 02:09 AM] finestone#0000
Its looks great i think you will find a backer in no time! The only issue that might come up is your export wieght


[08-Jan-25 02:09 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah actually both of you make sense, both are important


[08-Jan-25 02:09 AM] finestone#0000
I would reccomend seeking an upgrade to your starter ships ASAP using our @PSK team


[08-Jan-25 02:10 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
185 unit of AL each ship


[08-Jan-25 02:10 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
is that really low ?


[08-Jan-25 02:10 AM] finestone#0000
didnt you have like 70% of your company sitting on CX at one point LOL

[08-Jan-25 02:11 AM] finestone#0000
look at the weight volume for your ships


[08-Jan-25 02:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes 😅


[08-Jan-25 02:12 AM] finestone#0000
hehe thought so you know the pain.


[08-Jan-25 02:12 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok you're right


[08-Jan-25 02:12 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
what does PSK do ? offer me money to upgrade my ship ?


[08-Jan-25 02:13 AM] finestone#0000
They will give you a loan so you can upgrade your starter ship to a 1km3/3kt


[08-Jan-25 02:13 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
wow that's great


[08-Jan-25 02:13 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so I just apply for it in psk-op channel ?


[08-Jan-25 02:13 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
any requirements ?


[08-Jan-25 02:14 AM] finestone#0000
yes idk what thier wait time is or requirments youll have to ask them its a newer project


[08-Jan-25 02:14 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I'll do it now


[08-Jan-25 02:14 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
and for agp I'll just wait is that right ?


[08-Jan-25 02:15 AM] finestone#0000
yeah i would repost your plan so its not buried and just say your applying for grant usually youll get it in less than 24 hours


[08-Jan-25 02:16 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok thanks a lot for your help & time and also to Laaxus, really appreciate that !


[08-Jan-25 02:16 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

[08-Jan-25 03:00 AM] jcheung#0000
Wait until shipping is a concern


[08-Jan-25 03:00 AM] jcheung#0000
Too soon is too much of a burden for loan repayment


[08-Jan-25 03:01 AM] jcheung#0000
If you're at a point where shipping starts to be a concern, then you're established and can afford to axtually repay loans

As possible does imply ability to repay but i understand your meaning 🙂


[08-Jan-25 03:11 AM] jcheung#0000
If you have the ability to repay, but have a super light load, opening up a new base is going to get you better returns

{Reactions}
💯 

[08-Jan-25 03:13 AM] finestone#0000
for some reason my mind was also thinking starter ships were 200/200


[08-Jan-25 03:14 AM] jcheung#0000
Ah, yeah, no. Starters are pretty decent


[08-Jan-25 03:14 AM] finestone#0000
440t/day should be fine


[08-Jan-25 03:14 AM] finestone#0000
deimos is close anyways


[08-Jan-25 03:14 AM] jcheung#0000
The proximity is my thought as well


[08-Jan-25 03:15 AM] finestone#0000
As someone who colonized AU605 and WU070a as my first 2 places shipping was a problem XD


[08-Jan-25 03:15 AM] jcheung#0000
Plus there's so many opportunities to offload AL specifically on deimos itself

Looks good to me!


[08-Jan-25 05:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
You have a slight ALO deficit, so you'll do a tiny bit of importing there, but I think that's fine


[08-Jan-25 05:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
sending you the cash!


[08-Jan-25 05:33 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

[08-Jan-25 05:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Enjoy! What is the base construction cost, btw?


[08-Jan-25 05:35 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
actually its pretty flexible since the only required structure is EXT and SME


[08-Jan-25 05:35 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
for a 7 EXT + 14 SME will be 818k

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Jan-25 03:53 AM] finestone#0000
I also think Steel is quite profitable atm could import feo/fe as well


[09-Jan-25 04:42 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
Thats too much to import. Carbon  is already pretty expensive. I will consider start a base @ vulcan for steel😀


[09-Jan-25 04:57 AM] realharvey#0000
Steel and FE/FEO are very heavy. Keep that in mind


[09-Jan-25 05:05 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
thanks for hint


[10-Jan-25 02:36 PM] freeloader4#0000
Hi, is it possible to apply for this? I'll put my base format below. I realize Phobos isn't the most ideal place for this type of build but its where I started so I feel like I want to roll with it. https://prunplanner.org/shared/815559d0-471c-49e5-9b1a-cdaa7e94e429

Hello and welcome!


[10-Jan-25 02:40 PM] finestone#0000
I would do less farm and more FP and do DW as well importing the H20


[10-Jan-25 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looks like you're all good on the airlock and username set up and such. I think this is a reasonable starter base. Over time you'll probably want to move the farms and FPs to planets that have an agriculture and food processing COGC, but it's common to start with mixed bases like this


[10-Jan-25 02:42 PM] freeloader4#0000
let me play around with it for a sec, thats actually a nice idea


[10-Jan-25 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll send a grant! (you can tweak details later if you want!)

{Reactions}

[10-Jan-25 02:43 PM] finestone#0000
yeah FP on Phobos is fine right now eventually you will tear it down for an electronics base but its great safe income atm

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Jan-25 02:44 PM] finestone#0000
Also if you like the Food bussiness i would reccomend Norwick


[10-Jan-25 02:44 PM] finestone#0000
which you could just leave your permit on phobos relatily empty and go build there


[10-Jan-25 02:45 PM] finestone#0000
if you want Farms its Harmonia


[10-Jan-25 02:46 PM] freeloader4#0000
Ok thanks for the info, I've been looking at other planets as well, just rn i didnt really have the means to move


[10-Jan-25 02:48 PM] finestone#0000
The reason phobos is acceptable to off cogc is due to proximity to CX for newer players the cost savings on shipping, fuel, time and repairs is very benefitial


[10-Jan-25 02:51 PM] freeloader4#0000
yea i figured since its so close i could make it work out

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Jan-25 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, in my opinion once youv'e got this phobos base going, you can see if you want more FRM capacity, H2O capacity, or FP capacity, then add bases on Harmonia, Etherwind, or Norwick, respectively. Or maybe you want to go into manufacturing on Heph or something totally different

{Reactions}
👆 

[10-Jan-25 03:13 PM] freeloader4#0000
Yea I want to still with food, so based on what the 2 of you rec, I think i'll make a downsized mixed base on Phobos to not use all the permitsand start planning the other bases.


[10-Jan-25 03:18 PM] wikifeia#0000
Hey how's it going folks, I'm not sure if this channel or #associate-planning is better for this, but here goes. Is a single minded base like the one below more efficient than something diversified? Eventually I want to get into manufacturing, but my goal is to establish a set of self-sufficient resource production bases before getting to anything like that. I plan to build up this Deimos base first, then build one on Nike to supply Flux and produce BSE, then build one on Harmonia to supply carbon, potentially moving over to Norwick for food and drinking water production before setting up shop in Hephaestus for manufacturing. This is obviously going to take a very long time, but it's my broader plan that I want to build towards.

Don't forget to add Lux 1 and Lux 2 for your pioneers, also add 5 experts to metallurgy, that will give you a better projection on the costs and profits for the base. You will gain experts over time

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[10-Jan-25 03:45 PM] igfloz#0000
You also don't have to add 10 recipes per production. You will just ensure that you set them to repeat.  Adding numbers to recipes will come in time, when you start mixing stuff up 🙂


[10-Jan-25 03:46 PM] wikifeia#0000
understood, thank you!


[10-Jan-25 03:48 PM] igfloz#0000
Oh, and the biggest thing I have missed is you haven't set any STO - I recommend 2


[10-Jan-25 03:50 PM] wikifeia#0000
Understood, I'll add that. I wasn't expecting to be producing enough to need that much storage capacity


[10-Jan-25 03:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's a good setup- you are pretty well aligned with the metallurgy COGC and that's the most efficient. So overall that big plan is good.


[10-Jan-25 03:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
New players can manage fairly easily with less STO, but i personally always do two because I'm lazy and have a lot of bases


[10-Jan-25 03:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can fund this plan now, if you'd like!


[10-Jan-25 03:51 PM] wikifeia#0000
Would you recommend expanding to a second base only after my Deimos base is fully set up, or earlier?


[10-Jan-25 03:51 PM] realharvey#0000
There is a button on prunplanner that tells you how many days until storage is full. That should be over 7 days at least in my opinion


[10-Jan-25 03:51 PM] wikifeia#0000
I would appreciate that a lot, thank you!


[10-Jan-25 03:52 PM] igfloz#0000
his plan shows 4.17 days


[10-Jan-25 03:52 PM] wikifeia#0000
i think I'm generating 160 m^3 per day


[10-Jan-25 03:53 PM] wikifeia#0000
after making the changes you suggested it decreased to 2.44, so I'll definitely be adding the additional storage, thank you


[10-Jan-25 03:55 PM] igfloz#0000
Not that I'm doing it for you - I just wondered how I would approach it


[10-Jan-25 03:56 PM] wikifeia#0000
interesting, would you ship those resources to a different planet for smelting or just sell them as is?


[10-Jan-25 03:56 PM] igfloz#0000
I put the extra expert in resouce extraction (as you are allowed 6 experts total per base, but only 5 in one industry)


[10-Jan-25 03:57 PM] igfloz#0000
I use the CX at ANT as a "central storage" - so all of my overspill goes there


[10-Jan-25 03:58 PM] igfloz#0000
oh wait - I see that the link is not correct - Deleted now 😳

[10-Jan-25 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can always sell the ALO locally on Deimos, someone will always buy it. I guess I'd prefer to be mindful of the total income that you get for the permits


[10-Jan-25 04:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
I personally don't bother extracting O on the planet, it's abundant elsewhere and you'll have empty ships going to Deimos anyway, so the small amount of importing for oxygen is easy.

I'm sure I can pivot out of it later, I'm honestly just primarily focused on simplifying my supply chain at the moment

..and #internal-offers


[10-Jan-25 04:28 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd like to add that FLX on nike probably isn't the best idea. the on-site LST isn't really a benefit for it because it isn't logistically intensive, and the mismatched CoGC of the CHP makes it subpar profits. even among CHP recipes there's better things to make than FLX


[10-Jan-25 04:28 PM] wikifeia#0000
What would you suggest?


[10-Jan-25 04:29 PM] jvaler#0000
just more PP2 probably

I have a plan I would like to propose. How should I share the PRUNplanner link?

I'd like to get feedback on it

[16-Jan-25 12:37 AM] jvaler#0000
okay first thing i notice is how many different industries you have on this


[16-Jan-25 12:37 AM] jvaler#0000
harmonia is a planet with an agriculture CoGC, meaning matching industries get a +25% speed bonus which is very powerful


[16-Jan-25 12:39 AM] jvaler#0000
additionally, the expert mechanic in this game rewards specialization. you can only assign up to 6 experts in a base, and only up to 5 per industry. and the bonus is much more impactful at the 4th, and 5th experts compared to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd


[16-Jan-25 12:40 AM] jvaler#0000
so you'd be much more cost effective to build something that aligns with these things, like FRMs

[16-Jan-25 12:40 AM] iggydotexe#0000
So literally just farms and selling crops?


[16-Jan-25 12:41 AM] jvaler#0000
basically. you can also mix in some FP to process the crops on-site, as raw agri doesn't always sell too quickly


[16-Jan-25 12:41 AM] jvaler#0000
they're profitable enough on their own to excuse not aligning with CoGC or experts


[16-Jan-25 12:41 AM] iggydotexe#0000
I see, so make rations as efficiently as possible


[16-Jan-25 12:41 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[16-Jan-25 12:42 AM] jvaler#0000
and later on you can deconstruct those FP and move them to a new base on norwick, where you can get the food industries CoGC bonus and 5 experts


[16-Jan-25 12:43 AM] iggydotexe#0000
And what planet would have a CoGC with LAP and CHP?


[16-Jan-25 12:43 AM] jvaler#0000
the link i sent has a list of which buildings are which industries


[16-Jan-25 12:44 AM] jvaler#0000
but LABs and CHP are chemistry CoGC, which can be found on griffonstone, elon, and electronica


[16-Jan-25 12:45 AM] jvaler#0000
there are a few other chem planets but those are the most popular, either for their triple green environment status(no hazard mitigation construction materials required) or for their proximity/resources


[16-Jan-25 12:46 AM] jvaler#0000
if you wanna search the universe i recommend using taiyi's map and YAPT #prun-resources


[16-Jan-25 12:48 AM] jcheung#0000
Should always strongly consider use of luxury too


[16-Jan-25 12:48 AM] jvaler#0000
oh yes i missed that


[16-Jan-25 12:48 AM] jcheung#0000
And expert assignment-first couple come fast


[16-Jan-25 12:48 AM] jvaler#0000
it's basically always worth using luxury. in the cases it isn't, the recipe being made is most likely unprofitable in the first place


[16-Jan-25 12:49 AM] jcheung#0000
I/O looks okay, not using all of the permit though...


[16-Jan-25 12:49 AM] jcheung#0000
But the big issue jvaler pointed out already


[16-Jan-25 12:50 AM] jvaler#0000
i gotta go to bed now, but i call dibs on paying for iggy's grant


[16-Jan-25 12:50 AM] jvaler#0000
so if someone gets to it send me a cont to reimburse yourself


[16-Jan-25 12:50 AM] jcheung#0000
You can dibs on that?


[16-Jan-25 12:50 AM] jvaler#0000

I guess fix it in the mean time get money tomorrow?


[16-Jan-25 04:38 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
You do need to be PRO (at least briefly) to get the money though, as I understand it.


[16-Jan-25 07:39 AM] jvaler#0000
oh shit do they not have pro

How do i even use it


[16-Jan-25 10:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
My only idea of how i could use that aic is to spam 20 FS and a bunch of housing, but that doesnt seem efficient at all


[16-Jan-25 10:42 AM] laaxus#0000
2/4 on buildings 1/4 in consummables and input goods, 1/4 you keep it as cash


[16-Jan-25 10:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
What kind of buildings though, especially for a DW base


[16-Jan-25 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
FP


[16-Jan-25 10:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Jus FP


[16-Jan-25 10:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:45 AM] .urpalhal#0000
2 STO


[16-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
1 or two STO


[16-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
probably two


[16-Jan-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah ok


[16-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
27 FP 11 HB1 2 STO


[16-Jan-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
that's roughly 1M AIC in buildings


[16-Jan-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
so build half a base


[16-Jan-25 10:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
But i need some of that to go towards consumables


[16-Jan-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
.


[16-Jan-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
What about 24 FP, 10 HB1 and 2 STO, which leaves me with about 240k to split for cash and consumables

18 FP, 8 BH1 and 2 STO leaves me with ~390k left. Thats easily 30+ days supply without H2O


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
Sounds good?


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
KEEP CASH AS BUFFER


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
or do not


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000

[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
and you'll spend most of it on consummables


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
~200k pure cash even after 10 days


[16-Jan-25 10:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Before or after consumables ?


[16-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Before


[16-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000

so you'll learn painfully, sooner or later (it's not bad)


[16-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
13 FP, 6 HB1, 2 STO


[16-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
540k cash before consumables


[16-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
Roi 7 days


[16-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000

HER is spicy peppers


[16-Jan-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000
RATs are cheap food
FIM is medium food
MEA is Premium food


[16-Jan-25 11:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh kk


[16-Jan-25 11:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
I cant make any of the 3


[16-Jan-25 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean you *could*


[16-Jan-25 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Just need the stuff to make it at a FP


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
Would have to inport RAT, HER and MTP


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
don't


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
it requires capital


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
that you don't have


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
👍


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000
HER is pricy


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
produce either RAT or DW


[16-Jan-25 11:10 AM] laaxus#0000
HER on the CX is overpriced


[16-Jan-25 11:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
True


[16-Jan-25 11:11 AM] pagy1234#0000
Dw for sure, dont have anything for RAT on norwich


[16-Jan-25 11:11 AM] laaxus#0000
(because I buy every HER that is not overpriced KEKW)


[16-Jan-25 11:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I make and sell on CX


[16-Jan-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
Rat?


[16-Jan-25 11:13 AM] .urpalhal#0000
HER


[16-Jan-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh lol


[16-Jan-25 11:13 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I don’t touch 🐀


[16-Jan-25 11:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Anywho


[16-Jan-25 11:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Enough about me back to you 😅

[16-Jan-25 11:14 AM] laaxus#0000
HER is the best ROI recipe


[16-Jan-25 11:14 AM] laaxus#0000
for FRM


[16-Jan-25 11:14 AM] jcheung#0000
if you have a buyer


[16-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
(I am the buyer)


[16-Jan-25 11:15 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So about them FPs


[16-Jan-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
I can do 10


[16-Jan-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
If i make ships move faster


[16-Jan-25 11:16 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well don’t make them move too fast


[16-Jan-25 11:16 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc like waste


[16-Jan-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
he could take the ship kit upgrade


[16-Jan-25 11:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
Well not too fast, but currently round trip is ~32h, if i can get down to 24-26h then im golden


[16-Jan-25 11:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh try clicking multiple times


[16-Jan-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
My rule of thumb for shipping is :
1) I max FF fuel consumption
2) I put SF fuel consumption at roughly 200


[16-Jan-25 11:18 AM] .urpalhal#0000
There is this multi route weirdness glitch


[16-Jan-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
Nvm, round trip is probably ~38h


[16-Jan-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
I cant get exact number because all my ships are moving


[16-Jan-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
nah it's not that long


[16-Jan-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
time varies


[16-Jan-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
because of planet alignment


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] laaxus#0000
you won't get the same trip duration every time


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
This is across like 4 systems rho?


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh kk


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Like sometimes from ANT to Deimos is like 9 hours but then I click and get shorter times down to 4 hours


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
Il give high estimate as 38, and low as 32h


[16-Jan-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
Damn wth


[16-Jan-25 11:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Some weird pathing thing they’ve got going on

Wait no, so its fine then


[16-Jan-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
Shipping isnt as huge a deal


[16-Jan-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000

[16-Jan-25 11:54 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Did you sent me a cont for the building materials ?


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
wdym?


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Did you buy from CX?


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah?


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] laaxus#0000
seems like it


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh ok 🤷‍♂️


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] laaxus#0000
you forgot about the internal market


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh shooot


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[16-Jan-25 11:55 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Buying from market is never bad


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
i hope its not like 30% cheaper or smt 😭


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
it kinda is


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
uh oh


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] laaxus#0000
that's the point of the internal market


[16-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
well that sucks


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] igfloz#0000
you'll get the hang of it


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s ok


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
im still well within safe threshold though


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Exactly


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
to send your ship too fast is also a valuable lessons you'll learn over time


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah D:


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
you'll learn to quadruple check you did not forget anything


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Just use it when you do your base expansion


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] laaxus#0000
believe me 😄


[16-Jan-25 11:57 AM] igfloz#0000
...you may also find people to "partner up" with, where you can both benefit from maybe supplying each other with specific items


[16-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
will do from now on lol


[16-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
sry


[16-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
😅


[16-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh yeah, might be a good idea


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
We don’t me to like rag on you or anything like that


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Just like giving pointers on what we’ve seen with our own bases


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] igfloz#0000
lol, no you wont. Just wait, you'll see people screaming because they checked 5 times and still forgot something 😄


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
hahaha


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I over check and still fuck up


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
don't apologize


[16-Jan-25 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
nothing worth apologizing

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
might be me pretty soon if i ordered wrong number of things lol


[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
hope not tho


[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
would be sad D:


[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I send ships empty forget one thing send ships to wrong place

{Reactions}
👆 (2) 

[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] laaxus#0000
at some point you'll send a ship, then realise 10s later that you forgot to put something in the cargo


[16-Jan-25 12:00 PM] laaxus#0000
Then you'll cancel the trip


[16-Jan-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
they gotta fly all the way to orbit still


[16-Jan-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
and that'll be painful


[16-Jan-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[16-Jan-25 12:01 PM] igfloz#0000
you can abort, but yeah, 5 min cooldown to get into orbit, then another 5 min to land again


[16-Jan-25 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
did i accidentally take your book?


[16-Jan-25 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
this last month has been just packed with ships sent to the wrong spot


[16-Jan-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I rush to get things done in my spare time and then screw thing up


[16-Jan-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Heh


[16-Jan-25 12:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
alr, I need to sleep, Goodnight everyone, thanks for the investment :D


[16-Jan-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Gn


[16-Jan-25 12:06 PM] iggydotexe#0000
do go on...


[16-Jan-25 12:08 PM] laaxus#0000
ok I have 7 keys to give


[16-Jan-25 12:08 PM] laaxus#0000
dm'd you


[16-Jan-25 12:35 PM] iggydotexe#0000
Okay i have a plan to start up a brewery let me know what you think

Phase 1: Grow food/manufacture rations on Harmonia 
https://prunplanner.org/shared/64fe8160-1de1-4cef-9c89-1283567c9116

Phase 2: Establish base on Griffonstone (CHEM COCG) to make chems needed for growing hops
https://prunplanner.org/shared/903fcc99-daee-4295-b7e0-d7eb7c2be7ac

Phase 3: Establish base on Norwick for making ale/rations (Food COCG)

[16-Jan-25 12:36 PM] laaxus#0000
you should grow vegetables on harmonia, but manufacture food on norwick


[16-Jan-25 12:36 PM] iggydotexe#0000
lol i hit enter early


[16-Jan-25 12:37 PM] iggydotexe#0000
should i do norwick first before Griffonstonre?


[16-Jan-25 12:37 PM] laaxus#0000
just a question, what is fun to you


[16-Jan-25 12:37 PM] laaxus#0000
is it making profit ?


[16-Jan-25 12:37 PM] laaxus#0000
is it doing specific ?


[16-Jan-25 12:37 PM] iggydotexe#0000
i just wanna stay afloat and build wealth by making the best beer/wine/whatever in the galaxy


[16-Jan-25 12:38 PM] iggydotexe#0000
bit of an interstellar brewery roleplay i guess


[16-Jan-25 12:38 PM] iggydotexe#0000
I want feedback on my planning phase to make sure ime not missing anything


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
I honestly would recommend doing DW and RAT at first, just to build up wealth


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
and then transition to doing whatever you want


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
ofc you can do wine ale stuff, but you'll grow much slower


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
furthermore


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
know that, long term, it's really hard to specialise in only one thing


[16-Jan-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
You'd have to spread far and wide


[16-Jan-25 12:41 PM] laaxus#0000
which will cost you a lot in ships


[16-Jan-25 12:41 PM] laaxus#0000
so most people stay in a faction and build a bit of everything


[16-Jan-25 12:41 PM] laaxus#0000
this is just informations, you should still do what's fun to you at the end of the day


[16-Jan-25 12:42 PM] iggydotexe#0000
thats good advice. I can set up a good money maker on Harmonia first and expand from there. I think the hard part for the ale setup is the shipment lines between 3 planets


[16-Jan-25 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend at least 2 independant bases that makes money


[16-Jan-25 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
before trying to do something a bit more irsky


[16-Jan-25 12:44 PM] iggydotexe#0000
on griffonstone and harmonia, I'll set up seperate chem and DW/RAT plants. Once I get them up and running I can merge production toward Norwick? Or do you reccommend to go second base on norwick first to boost RAT production?


[16-Jan-25 12:45 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd first do either harmonia or norwick full base (preference for norwick) then do the other one


[16-Jan-25 12:45 PM] laaxus#0000
what kind of chem building do you need ?


[16-Jan-25 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000
CHP are very profitable right now, so that's an option too


[16-Jan-25 12:46 PM] iggydotexe#0000
yeah i was looking at CHP


[16-Jan-25 12:46 PM] laaxus#0000
doing CL is very profitable


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
Either a CHP or FP base is fine


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
they both have insane RoI


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] iggydotexe#0000
yes. Mine HAL and import H20 to make CL+NA2


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
tho CHP base can be hard on HAL transport


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
make sure to check it's ok


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
you don't have to mine it at first


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] iggydotexe#0000
HAL exists on Griffonstone luckily. I would have to ship over water from Harmonia


[16-Jan-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
you can just buy it from @.urpalhal


[16-Jan-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
he's **literally** the HAL guy


[16-Jan-25 12:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I am drowning in HAL

[16-Jan-25 12:48 PM] iggydotexe#0000
ah good to know. With the grant does it make sense to just set up a quarry on my own?


[16-Jan-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
no


[16-Jan-25 12:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
HAL is chunky


[16-Jan-25 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
Either make a CHP base and buy HAL from Hal98


[16-Jan-25 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
Or make a FP base on Norwick


[16-Jan-25 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
is what I'd recommend


[16-Jan-25 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
A FRM base on harmonia isn't a bad choice either


[16-Jan-25 12:49 PM] iggydotexe#0000
thats what i currently have on harmonia


[16-Jan-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
then either fp or chp


[16-Jan-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
both are insanely worth it


[16-Jan-25 12:50 PM] iggydotexe#0000

once you get enough FP for it to become an issue, remember that we have 0% interest loans available for our #psk-information WCB upgrade kits. it comes out to just 15k/d in repayment, which should be easily managable with any decently profitable base


[16-Jan-25 04:31 PM] jvaler#0000
@iggydotexe did you get your grant?


[16-Jan-25 05:39 PM] pagy1234#0000
Oh nice, yeah il look into that


[16-Jan-25 06:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
I do still have 91k worth of materials that havent been filled


[16-Jan-25 06:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
im going to try and send you a contract in a sec


[16-Jan-25 06:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
if i do use the internal market, where do i order too?


[16-Jan-25 06:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
just ANT station?


[16-Jan-25 06:30 PM] pagy1234#0000
or where I need the materials


[16-Jan-25 06:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yo just message them and then send them a CONT if they say it’s ok


[16-Jan-25 06:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
wait message who


[16-Jan-25 06:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And yeah usually the materials will be  at ANT unless otherwise specified


[16-Jan-25 06:31 PM] pagy1234#0000
ah ok

Little update on the grant I was given incase you guys are interested:


[18-Jan-25 10:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Total spending estimation is pretty spot on somehow, used up around 650k by now, and only small payments left whilst iI just finished first production order of about 70k worth of DW, so looking good on that front.


[18-Jan-25 10:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have alot more wiggle room than I thought I would have, can start expanding as soon as I feel comfortable running it as it is.


[18-Jan-25 10:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
Not far off, sometimes I canget lucky with the orbits and get (potentialy) a 24h round trip, but im getting around 15-17h per leg, so if I exclude waiting times i can in practice get consistent 32h trips


[18-Jan-25 10:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
Looks like it, but somethings to watch out for the future is that H2O market is thrashing itself while the value of DW looks to be steadily declining, at least for now. Everything should be fine for the forseable future but its something im constantly looking at.

{Reactions}
✌️ 

[18-Jan-25 10:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
(H2O price is up 9%, DW is down 3% last i checked)


[18-Jan-25 10:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
Nice to hear! Margins on DW will definitely fluctuate, but I doubt you'll ever lose money making it

At least, barring any market craziness that none of us can predict 😄


[18-Jan-25 10:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, even with the slight lower margins i should have all my money back by the end of next week :D


[18-Jan-25 10:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
Lets not jinx it lmao, i dont need anything to happen right now😁


[18-Jan-25 03:23 PM] jvaler#0000
do you have a plan made? i think i've missed some conversation


[18-Jan-25 03:23 PM] jvaler#0000
wanna get you your grant asap, or whenever you're ready


[20-Jan-25 12:04 AM] iggydotexe#0000
i do have a 3-part plan. Basically working toward developing ALE production on Norwick. I can send you the prunplanner links


[20-Jan-25 12:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
I provide slightly discounted DW on the Norwick LM, might benefit you :D


[20-Jan-25 12:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
market is around 112pu, i sell at 107pu


[20-Jan-25 12:18 AM] iggydotexe#0000
i will for sure note that


[20-Jan-25 12:18 AM] iggydotexe#0000
its a little daunting to set up but i think i have the idea of what i need to do


[20-Jan-25 12:19 AM] iggydotexe#0000
my full set up will cost more than 1 mil (mainly the orchard price is .5 mil) so I have to set up something profitable first


[20-Jan-25 12:40 AM] jvaler#0000
alright i trust you'll do well, sent you the grant

https://prunplanner.org/shared/dac0e59b-6b6f-46e0-901d-29fe0cbf8939

Phase 1,2,3^
-Ignore the orchard for now on phase 1, its just so i can see the final costs. 
-Phase 2 should be profitable, and is scalable
-Phase 3 is doable once I can afford the 3rd base and the Orchard. Then all RAT production will be moved over there. 

Questions:
-Does it make sense to set up a rig on my Phase 1 Harmonia for independent H20 early on when producing rations for sale?

Please let me know any advice you have or information you would like to receive.
Thanks for taking a look and let me know how to get the grant started!

these plans each have very few buildings, you're not planning on making all 3 core modules right away are you?


[20-Jan-25 12:45 AM] iggydotexe#0000
no, one at a time. First beefing up my Harmonia, then building on Griffonstone, then settling on Norwick when I have enough money. Maybe get to Norwick in a month or more after my bases start to show dividends. Is that a reasonable plan?


[20-Jan-25 12:47 AM] jvaler#0000
okay yeah that sounds good


[20-Jan-25 12:57 AM] iggydotexe#0000
Grant received! I'll get buying materials! thank you I'll be sure to keep you updated


[20-Jan-25 01:05 AM] jvaler#0000

[31-Jan-25 06:08 AM] cactu55#0000
Hey all, just upgraded to pro so wanted to take advantage of the grant. HRB farm for now on Harmonia:

https://prunplanner.org/shared/673e8f26-2066-4cfd-be79-e9b6dd8f39dc

and then possibly transition into C/Food from there.

[31-Jan-25 06:39 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm not one of the offical people, but some quick thoughts:

- You should configure experts in the plan, since you'll get the first few pretty quick anyway (and they give you an idea of long term shipping sustainability).
- Your inputs (DDT's current situation aside) are relatively cheap, why stop at only 2 FRM when the grant is for 1M?


[31-Jan-25 06:40 AM] cactu55#0000
oop sorry I had it setup like that


[31-Jan-25 06:41 AM] cactu55#0000
but then changed back to what i currently have


[31-Jan-25 06:41 AM] cactu55#0000
but good idea!


[31-Jan-25 06:59 AM] cactu55#0000
Not sure why the profit/costs aren't coming up in the shared version


[31-Jan-25 07:12 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Probably the shared version doesn't have a CX assigned.  (I've even noticed this when I look at my own shared plans in incognito)

I just copied the plan and assigned it a CX/empire myself.

[31-Jan-25 07:14 AM] realharvey#0000
Yep thats exactly the reason why it does not show up


[31-Jan-25 07:14 AM] cactu55#0000
Weird, I deleted it and did it again but doesn't work


[31-Jan-25 07:14 AM] cactu55#0000
Don't know how to attach the CX to the shared one


[31-Jan-25 07:14 AM] realharvey#0000
you can't


[31-Jan-25 07:15 AM] cactu55#0000
Oh I see


[31-Jan-25 07:15 AM] realharvey#0000
it's easy to just use a copy and attach a fitting CX setting to check it

Do I need to add anything else to recieve the grant?


[31-Jan-25 08:34 AM] jvaler#0000
if i understand correctly it's just a 13 FRM HER base? looks good to me if so, i can send it right away


[31-Jan-25 08:35 AM] jvaler#0000
went ahead and sent


[31-Jan-25 08:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
beat me to it 😄


[31-Jan-25 08:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
@cactu55 just be aware that agricultural products can sometimes sit on the CX for a while, but that probably isn’t the case for HER right now


[31-Jan-25 08:37 AM] cactu55#0000
That's it for now!


[31-Jan-25 08:37 AM] cactu55#0000
Yeah, I might ride this wave and then convert to C production


[31-Jan-25 08:37 AM] jvaler#0000
and if that does happen it's very easy to diversify FRMs, just add more recipes to the queue


[31-Jan-25 08:38 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sounds like a good plan 🙂


[31-Jan-25 08:38 AM] cactu55#0000
I think I accepted it


[31-Jan-25 08:38 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[31-Jan-25 08:38 AM] jvaler#0000
you've got your money now


[31-Jan-25 08:38 AM] cactu55#0000
Perfect, thank you so much!


[31-Jan-25 08:39 AM] jvaler#0000
no problem :D


[31-Jan-25 08:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
Also, just so you know, I sell DDT internally for 3k/u 🙂


[31-Jan-25 08:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
So you can save some money instead of buying it off the CX (probably also from me)


[31-Jan-25 08:42 AM] cactu55#0000
would I need to pick it up from anywhere?


[31-Jan-25 08:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
It’s all at Antares Station, so same place you’d be going for the CX - you can check my stock and prices in #internal-offers  🙂


[31-Jan-25 08:44 AM] cactu55#0000
Perfect, I definitely do need some.


[31-Jan-25 09:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Check the #internal-offers for construction materials and consumables - takes your grant a little bit  further 😉


[31-Jan-25 09:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, if nobody happens to have bfabs or lfabs, dm me what you need. Have some of them on stock at ANT


[31-Jan-25 09:12 AM] cactu55#0000

Hallo!


[03-Feb-25 08:30 AM] garoo2004#0000
I would like to take a grant


[03-Feb-25 08:30 AM] garoo2004#0000
i have 3 bases in mind, namely in harmonia, nemesis and etherwind


[03-Feb-25 08:34 AM] garoo2004#0000
after consulting with a few corp members, ive decided to go full farming as of now, despite starting as carbon farmer


[03-Feb-25 08:35 AM] garoo2004#0000
for now i want to fully upgrade my base on harmonia to produce HER, as it seems to be very lucrative


[03-Feb-25 08:35 AM] garoo2004#0000
then, i will move on to nemesis to set up another farming base


[03-Feb-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
It is currently very lucrative but keep in mind that it will probably change in the following week(s ?)


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
many many people started HER frms


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
however it is currently very lucrative


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
and it's easy to change FRM recipe


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
just don't believe you'll keep this kind of profit forever


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] garoo2004#0000
yeah, if anything, ill just change to GRN


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
current HER price is absurd


[03-Feb-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
HER and FIM prices are bound to lower


[03-Feb-25 08:37 AM] garoo2004#0000
lastly, im thinking of setting up on eetherwind to supply water for my other two farming bases, and might diversify to carbon farming as well


[03-Feb-25 08:38 AM] garoo2004#0000
so its like the three bases can supply each other yknow


[03-Feb-25 08:43 AM] garoo2004#0000
anyway these are the bases' plans:

norwick?

ill check that one


[03-Feb-25 09:12 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd tentatively accept etherwind as ""antares"" though given it's conquered system name  =P


[03-Feb-25 09:13 AM] laaxus#0000
Wait my takeover of their government


[03-Feb-25 09:14 AM] jvaler#0000
this plan looks good, i'll go ahead and send you the grant

although personally i'd swap the RIG for a STO for convenience. the profit & ROI on it is so bad it barely helps lol

[03-Feb-25 09:16 AM] garoo2004#0000
but idk


[03-Feb-25 09:16 AM] laaxus#0000
shipping has a cost


[03-Feb-25 09:16 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
means you can leave more imports there.


[03-Feb-25 09:17 AM] laaxus#0000
it allows you to lower your shipping


[03-Feb-25 09:17 AM] jvaler#0000
convenience


[03-Feb-25 09:17 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
plus, your etherwind setup needs 1 500t/500m3 ship per day (for exports), so presumably you'd upgrade a ship before you got that fully built.


[03-Feb-25 09:17 AM] laaxus#0000
because when storage is full, your production stops
And that's worst case scenario


[03-Feb-25 09:18 AM] garoo2004#0000
damn ive never considered the logistics

[03-Feb-25 09:25 AM] garoo2004#0000
hopefully


[03-Feb-25 09:25 AM] jcheung#0000
CM plus WAR is all you strictly need


[03-Feb-25 09:26 AM] jcheung#0000
you can run a tight shipping schedule with efficient ship usage but it'll cost you in micromanagement


[03-Feb-25 09:26 AM] laaxus#0000
Disagree


[03-Feb-25 09:26 AM] laaxus#0000
as long as your storage time < min(import time, export time) not having storage lose you money


[03-Feb-25 09:26 AM] jcheung#0000
STO is only ever not a sanity preservation measure when you're making very specific goods


[03-Feb-25 09:27 AM] jcheung#0000
that's not strictly true. it's `min(import time, export time) - ship travel time`


[03-Feb-25 09:28 AM] laaxus#0000
nah, ship travel time is on both side


[03-Feb-25 09:28 AM] laaxus#0000
so it evens out


[03-Feb-25 09:28 AM] laaxus#0000
anyway


[03-Feb-25 09:28 AM] laaxus#0000
doesn't really matter


[03-Feb-25 09:29 AM] laaxus#0000
point is


[03-Feb-25 09:29 AM] jcheung#0000
and as long as your production queue is set to finish just after arrival, you can bank mass in the factories


[03-Feb-25 09:29 AM] laaxus#0000
not having storage can force you to ship more often that is economically efficient


[03-Feb-25 09:29 AM] laaxus#0000
and therefore can decrease profits


[03-Feb-25 09:29 AM] jcheung#0000
you didn't let me finish


[03-Feb-25 09:31 AM] jcheung#0000
anyhow. most planets that aren't brand new have at least 2WAR, and 2500t/m is enough to ship "efficiently"

Ask PruPlanner for planets with an Agriculture COGC within a few jumps of the CX ? 🙂


[03-Feb-25 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
i suspect a lot of those will be HYF planets


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes they all are I’m pretty sure


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think Harmonia is the only non HYF one


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] garoo2004#0000
whats a hyf


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
hydroponic farm


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
lots of water, different set of plants.  Needs NS to grow.


[03-Feb-25 09:38 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
no need for soil


[03-Feb-25 09:39 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
if you're farming for carbon, you can get HCP and MAI (but not GRN) that way at least.


[03-Feb-25 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
demeter can hold FRM too

expensive


[03-Feb-25 09:49 AM] garoo2004#0000
oh and also regarding whether to use rig or sto, in my setup the rig are there to alleviate the water cost of the farm so


[03-Feb-25 09:50 AM] garoo2004#0000
its not meant to be exported, and rn it seems h20 are expensice


[03-Feb-25 09:50 AM] jvaler#0000
it only alleviates ~250 AIC/d of cost, which is why it has such bad ROI


[03-Feb-25 09:50 AM] jvaler#0000
harmonia doesn't have great H2O deposit yield


[03-Feb-25 09:51 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
In some other world, it might be saving you shipping logistics even at low yield, but... know that this is why you are doing it, not cost.

(and, that world isn't this one, your harmonia shipping is dominated by exports, and has plenty of room to import on those same trips)

[FWIW, before I got my AGP I had 2 rigs built, and they're still there on Harmonia doing their thing, but they're the first thing to rip out when I need the area back].


[03-Feb-25 09:52 AM] jcheung#0000
closer to 900 per rig with current asks 😜


[03-Feb-25 09:52 AM] jvaler#0000

something is goofy


[03-Feb-25 09:54 AM] jcheung#0000
the split is like... nothing


[03-Feb-25 09:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yes.  I have.. not understood what those things in the production choice dropdown are using as data, but they always seem different than what the base does once I pick them.


[03-Feb-25 09:55 AM] jcheung#0000
wtf are my market settings


[03-Feb-25 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t think the drop-down values include depreciation (or that might be the values in the blue graph section - one of the two of them doesn’t)


[03-Feb-25 09:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I tend to click on the blue graph button after picking anyway.


[03-Feb-25 09:56 AM] jcheung#0000
that's the thing, the drop down is 275/d "profit" but the total base profit goes up almost 900


[03-Feb-25 09:56 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
experts?


[03-Feb-25 09:56 AM] jcheung#0000
0, but it doesn't matter


[03-Feb-25 09:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
How many rigs?


[03-Feb-25 09:57 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
experts do seem to affect that though (for me)


[03-Feb-25 09:57 AM] jcheung#0000
single rig


[03-Feb-25 09:57 AM] jcheung#0000
it'll affect the ratio, not the fact that one is more positive or negative


[03-Feb-25 09:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Depreciation


[03-Feb-25 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
It’s gotta be in the drop down but not in the values on the top right?

{Reactions}
🤔 

[03-Feb-25 09:58 AM] jcheung#0000
idk, documentation is a bit rough


[03-Feb-25 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you click into the “cost to make” area, what does it show the depreciation per h2o as?


[03-Feb-25 10:00 AM] jcheung#0000
27.25


[03-Feb-25 10:00 AM] jcheung#0000
i guess *4 maybe? not sure if that value is for the whole building or for single run


[03-Feb-25 10:01 AM] jcheung#0000
still has a big ol split


[03-Feb-25 10:02 AM] sidepipe#0000
27.25 x 25.71 water per day is about 700 of depreciation, which checks out


[03-Feb-25 10:02 AM] jcheung#0000
wait what


[03-Feb-25 10:02 AM] jcheung#0000
it's per unit?


[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
Isn’t it? I thought you were giving the value per unit - I can’t check myself because I’m on mobile 😅

[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
that view is per unit [edit: I mean the bottom section, but it might be more]


[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] jcheung#0000
what the piss


[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] jcheung#0000
what about workforce


[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
But that would make sense because the difference between 275/day and 900/day is about 700 of depreciation


[03-Feb-25 10:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
Included


[03-Feb-25 10:04 AM] jcheung#0000
degradation isn't in cogm


[03-Feb-25 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
So the top right view in the overview there is just the day-to-day profit - items out less items in


[03-Feb-25 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
But the individual recipes count cost of repairs too


[03-Feb-25 10:04 AM] jcheung#0000
yes, but is that per unit, per batch, per day?


[03-Feb-25 10:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
Batch


[03-Feb-25 10:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
Degradation of buildings is shown per unit and workforce per batch because I don’t know why

{Reactions}
🤣 😖 

[03-Feb-25 10:06 AM] jcheung#0000
so you see my confusion here, hard to see per unit above a per batch, followed by per unit cost that doesn't include a per unit cost


[03-Feb-25 10:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’m not saying it’s not confusing, it totally is 😁


[03-Feb-25 10:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I kinda justify the layout of the main screen to myself as follows: the overview shows you pretty much what you’d make on a typical day, since it just counts workforce consumables and inputs. And the drop-down value shows you the “true” profit over a long period of time including repairs


[03-Feb-25 10:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you wanted the overview to be accurate, it’d have to include repair materials in the list and you’d have weird things like 0.1 BBH per day or something like that


[03-Feb-25 10:19 AM] garoo2004#0000

[05-Feb-25 11:06 AM] chalu2#0000
Regarding the AGP:
As mentioned in the server-airlock, I joined prosperous universe 3 days ago, on Harmonia. And now I would like to apply for the grant. I made a base layout in prunplanner for a RAT production line on Harmonia and a DW production line on Etherwind. On prunplanner both of them look promising with ROIs of 15-16 days each. Both of those planes would cost around 1 mil in construction and could have around 60,000 in daily profits according to prunplanner.
I still have to check the transport costs for the Base of Etherwind, therefore I would start with building up the Harmonia base first, and think about the idea with Etherwind when I have a stable income from Harmonia.
What do you guys think about this idea? Do you want to know anything else?

[05-Feb-25 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000

just food for thoughts


[05-Feb-25 11:21 AM] garoo2004#0000
a nearby planet suitable for farming would be nemesis


[05-Feb-25 11:22 AM] jcheung#0000
it's not the worst thing ever for the start, as long as you plan to decommission them later... but idk about 14 of them

if you insist on staying nearby ~~harmonia~~ etherwind


[05-Feb-25 11:23 AM] garoo2004#0000
one agri planet that is nearby to harmonia would be demeter


[05-Feb-25 11:23 AM] sobyshka#0000
Im here to pay the blood debt. Or something.


[05-Feb-25 11:24 AM] garoo2004#0000
oh lol i misread, you never intend to farm on etherwind lol


[05-Feb-25 11:24 AM] sobyshka#0000
Why do you want to mix Industries? You missing extra 25% profit, saving on repairs and consumables. CoGC bonus is REALLY powerful. Don't neglect it.


[05-Feb-25 11:25 AM] chalu2#0000
yaeh, I thought processing on location will increase the price. I will look into selling raw agricultural products instead


[05-Feb-25 11:26 AM] garoo2004#0000
well early game i think theres no problem building a fp, just so you can make some money first


[05-Feb-25 11:27 AM] garoo2004#0000
but later down the line transition harmonia to fully dedicate for farms


[05-Feb-25 11:28 AM] garoo2004#0000
plus raw greens usually takes very long time to sell


[05-Feb-25 11:28 AM] garoo2004#0000
so that might be a bad idea


[05-Feb-25 11:30 AM] sobyshka#0000
So... what do you want to achieve? Self-sufficiency in consumables?


[05-Feb-25 11:30 AM] garoo2004#0000
you can process the greens on Norwick instead


[05-Feb-25 11:30 AM] chalu2#0000
At the moment the RAT price is realy high so the mixed Farms /Foodproduktion makes 60,000 while pure Farms make 40,000 profit according to prunplanner. but I dont know how long this will last...


[05-Feb-25 11:31 AM] garoo2004#0000
you can even make the dw on that planet. its cogc is food industry


[05-Feb-25 11:32 AM] garoo2004#0000
but youre not selling the greens, rather, you will transport it to a separate base to process them. thats why im recommending norwick


[05-Feb-25 11:33 AM] garoo2004#0000
so 40k worth of greens are being processed into RAT will bring you more profit


[05-Feb-25 11:33 AM] chalu2#0000
hm, I still need to get a feeling for how much transporting cost. I dont really know thet jet.


[05-Feb-25 11:34 AM] garoo2004#0000
true that. as of now its fine to have hybrid fp/frm, but dont commit into it


[05-Feb-25 11:37 AM] sobyshka#0000
Ok. So try to make in prunplaner 3 planets.
1) Water source
2) Farms
3) FP(Food processor planet) What will make DW/RAT for you. 

Also in prunplaner use that button to determine how much you expect to sell stuff for and buy. Also i see you using more that 500 area. Please dont do that. You wasting 50% of your permit. You can just make new base and make 100% of profit from that permit but you chose to limit yoursef to 50%. That really unnecessary.

the grant is to develop base in antares space ...


[05-Feb-25 12:13 PM] laaxus#0000
as etherwind is not (yet) antarean


[05-Feb-25 12:14 PM] laaxus#0000
I would put 3 experts, you get to 3 very fast


[05-Feb-25 12:22 PM] sobyshka#0000
You will need 1 STO at least. In all bases. I dont know any scenario where you dont want to put al least 1 STO. It storage unit gives you 5000 t/m storage at base.


[05-Feb-25 12:24 PM] sobyshka#0000
Specially at Water planet.


[05-Feb-25 12:24 PM] chalu2#0000
I'll putt them in, thanks. And yeah, I the grant will be used for the farming and food industry in antares space. that will be about 1.5 mil when its finished.


[05-Feb-25 12:31 PM] chalu2#0000
the production amounts on prunplanner aren't quite balanced at the moment but I will take care of that later, after I had some food.


[05-Feb-25 12:32 PM] sobyshka#0000
Also about water planet. Your ship can hold 2500 water each. And there a lot less than your bases drink per day. Starter ships is usually upgraded to 3k heavy carrier(Because it MUCH cheaper, you save around of couple millions). And it can hold 5000 water. So until you get at least one that ship i recommend to lower amount FP you use to processing and just stockpile FP inputs(Water and Green stuff) somewhere at ANT. 

I also see you dont use Premium consumables, use them, they work and work well.


[05-Feb-25 12:35 PM] sobyshka#0000
And...  what now @jvaler  I just send him money? Its my first time. What do i do


[05-Feb-25 12:40 PM] chalu2#0000
yeah, I updated to premium consumables, and I will look into better ships. I will keep an eye on logistics while building up, thanks for that tip

@chalu2 Somewhere here should be button to terminate the contract. You do not need to provide 1 RAT

Greetings sharks, I am a lowly water farmer/Nestlé water bottle simulator wanting to move into the glorious region of Antares and I'm here to apply for a grant. I have, honestly, little idea of what industry I am heading towards but I'm primarily set up for resource extraction due to my HQ being not in faction space + I already am doing that in the outer rims of Antares in the lowly CIS region (Etherwind & KW-602). I have a few plans made that are primarily starting new industries compared to my FP/RIG loop. They are rough and primarily exist to rotate between different items not just one production, well except the A2 project which could be made if D1 is construted and would be focused on AML's making Tungstun (W) or other needed intermediates.

https://prunplanner.org/shared/2bcf7c4a-5d86-492b-bef4-058df44526af - A1 CHP faciltiy right now set to NS because of my flood of H2O I can throw on it, but can be changed to whatever is expected.

NS out in electronica? may i ask why there in particular?


[05-Feb-25 05:06 PM] shokanshi#0000
There is no real reason, it could be built on any Chemistry planet but its mostly just distance to my storage on KW-602


[05-Feb-25 05:06 PM] jcheung#0000
don't forget your settler luxuries


[05-Feb-25 05:06 PM] shokanshi#0000
Which is full of DW/H2O. ^ and ah yes, forgot to click that. it would be indeed getting the luxuries


[05-Feb-25 05:07 PM] jcheung#0000
i could be off becasue i'm going off memory, but isn't electronica a bit far from KW602?


[05-Feb-25 05:08 PM] shokanshi#0000
Anyway here is D1 (https://prunplanner.org/shared/82d39de1-cb63-4be3-a053-d28fb56bfdeb) and her possible expansion project of A2 (https://prunplanner.org/shared/65e50d78-3f4b-447d-bf81-e4d14e5e627f) shes jsut an AML planet.

[05-Feb-25 05:09 PM] jcheung#0000
what ships do you currently have?


[05-Feb-25 05:09 PM] shokanshi#0000
It's about 5 to 6 jumpish from what I remember, I have two ships which I need to invest to upgrade more but one is a 1k/1k and the other is just a starter still.


[05-Feb-25 05:10 PM] shokanshi#0000
It would primarily be shipping with the 1k/1k till the starter gets moved to a larger size.


[05-Feb-25 05:10 PM] shokanshi#0000
Now I must walk to work, I will reply when I'm at my office.

[05-Feb-25 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
ok. D1 you don't have the shipping capacity for. shelve that one for now


[05-Feb-25 05:12 PM] jcheung#0000
same for C1


[05-Feb-25 05:12 PM] jcheung#0000
both of those are either close to or over 1k shipping daily


[05-Feb-25 05:13 PM] jcheung#0000
so that leaves A1 and B1, which will require some pretty regular shipping


[05-Feb-25 05:14 PM] jcheung#0000
(though for shipping ADI does offer an interest free loan for a WCB upgrade from starter-not sure how the MCB will affect things)


[05-Feb-25 05:15 PM] jcheung#0000
for A1 i would suggest finding a chemistry planet that's a little closer


[05-Feb-25 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Griffonstone (LS-300c) might be a good candidate


[05-Feb-25 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
that's 2 jumps away

[05-Feb-25 05:17 PM] jcheung#0000
i'll pause here while you digest what i said so far


[05-Feb-25 05:28 PM] shokanshi#0000
Thank you for the information I'm right now reading while waiting train to pass but yes those chemical plans could be on any chemical planet so Griffonstone works fine


[05-Feb-25 05:30 PM] shokanshi#0000
For the resource extraction ones they would most likely only be half built using the full grant money while my reserves and upcoming revenue with DW sales or a loan in addition would go towards vessel upgrade then into finishing the base


[05-Feb-25 05:31 PM] shokanshi#0000
I have 2.2mil CIS, 477k NCC in my liquid assets by itself so those would be funded into this ANT initiative


[05-Feb-25 05:33 PM] shokanshi#0000
Alright I'm back to walking, I'll be back in 30 minutes


[05-Feb-25 06:15 PM] shokanshi#0000
I'm now avaliable once more, sorry for the time


[05-Feb-25 06:22 PM] sobyshka#0000
Sorry, how your storage looks like?


[05-Feb-25 06:22 PM] sobyshka#0000
Do you just... Leave stuff there? Why you don't use CX?


[05-Feb-25 06:24 PM] shokanshi#0000
Ah its 3 storage spots but prior to my recent lull in the game due to real life work I was trading DW and H2O to new players and randoms on Etherwind and the KW602 bottling planet


[05-Feb-25 06:24 PM] shokanshi#0000
Its half full, 260ish, space with my own FP


[05-Feb-25 06:25 PM] shokanshi#0000
So since I was moving so much water from Etherwind to KW602 I was just in contracts filling people up


[05-Feb-25 06:26 PM] shokanshi#0000
I used to only do CX with those runs and I was flooding the market it was such low margins that I stopped for few months


[05-Feb-25 06:26 PM] shokanshi#0000
And it seems since I last did it the BEN CX went from like 60cis for water to 140cis so that's kind of funny


[05-Feb-25 06:26 PM] sobyshka#0000
I mean why dont you use CX to store stuff.


[05-Feb-25 06:27 PM] shokanshi#0000
Ah just distance, I was more focused on looping between my two planets than going off to BEN. When I did that it was to restock and sell DW anyway


[05-Feb-25 06:31 PM] shokanshi#0000
And actually looking at my contracts other than a lot of small sales to new players most of my big dumping of excess warehouse water was to VLNS / Zipatsu who seems to be in this discord as well.


[05-Feb-25 06:35 PM] sobyshka#0000
So. I have counter offer.

Do you like Carbon?

[05-Feb-25 06:36 PM] shokanshi#0000
Ah an INC facility?


[05-Feb-25 06:37 PM] sobyshka#0000
Yea. And be part of big family of carbon lovers. We love carbon.


[05-Feb-25 06:38 PM] shokanshi#0000
Now my knowledge of the Carbon is limited to years ago when I did smelting FE up in Kiruna/Cortez area of space but at least back then


[05-Feb-25 06:38 PM] shokanshi#0000
It was quite a micro managing business with the needed agricultural inputs for very little profit margains


[05-Feb-25 06:39 PM] shokanshi#0000
So I would need some information on recent and especially how it is in ANT


[05-Feb-25 06:41 PM] sobyshka#0000
Positives:
You need only 1 permit to be a part. 
All logistics handled by me.
All inputs provided. 
All consumables and repairs   costs covered. 

Downsides: 
Profit slightly less compared if you do it all alone.


[05-Feb-25 06:43 PM] sobyshka#0000
Average 50k profit per day. From one base. I will provide all materials for base construction and some consumables. For first time.


[05-Feb-25 06:44 PM] shokanshi#0000
And what planet would this be on?


[05-Feb-25 06:45 PM] sobyshka#0000
Nascent


[05-Feb-25 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
hahaha, BURN recruitment


[05-Feb-25 06:47 PM] sobyshka#0000

[05-Feb-25 06:57 PM] shokanshi#0000
Yea I don't know about the INC facility, its such a low profit margin for something that seems more like a side thing ticking in the corner.


[05-Feb-25 07:09 PM] sobyshka#0000
Well. I cant agree with you here. Even if you just sell your weekly split it ok money for little amount of effort. 

It might be annoying to send conts every Monday. But with multi items cont it will be just 2 conts every Monday and when you need more inputs.


[05-Feb-25 07:09 PM] jvaler#0000
margins don't really matter, profit/d and ROI matters


[05-Feb-25 07:10 PM] sobyshka#0000
Aren't they the same?


[05-Feb-25 07:13 PM] sobyshka#0000
Margin, is your income, and profit/d is also your income?


[05-Feb-25 07:13 PM] sobyshka#0000
Ok, i googled, and i understand now, that i dont understand how it works.


[05-Feb-25 07:16 PM] garoo2004#0000
how much you're buying the carbons


[05-Feb-25 07:24 PM] jcheung#0000
technically.... with multi you can do two a month


[05-Feb-25 07:26 PM] garoo2004#0000
do you want a full INC base?


[05-Feb-25 07:35 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought margin was the difference between input cost and total profit, like the % that rprun shows you on the production finance screen


[05-Feb-25 07:37 PM] shokanshi#0000
its the amount of profit a business makes compared to their revenue.


[05-Feb-25 07:38 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that


[05-Feb-25 07:39 PM] shokanshi#0000
but it can also be included as your ROI because the cost of construction is usually factored in.


[05-Feb-25 07:48 PM] shokanshi#0000
@jvaler We'll solve the profit margain math once this installs.

It made the rounds in the tech blogs this week


[05-Feb-25 08:01 PM] sobyshka#0000
Yea. We need another burner guy. We make around 650 carbon  per share every week, plus little more on top.


[05-Feb-25 08:01 PM] sobyshka#0000
Rprun?


[05-Feb-25 08:03 PM] garoo2004#0000
huh, what recipe are you using? GRN? HCP?


[05-Feb-25 08:04 PM] garoo2004#0000
i thought for the best output possible is to use the triple burn one, but they're hungry af so usually its reversed, as in you would need more FRM instead of more INC


[05-Feb-25 08:24 PM] jvaler#0000
refined prun


[05-Feb-25 08:25 PM] sobyshka#0000
Yes. We use triple one


[05-Feb-25 08:27 PM] garoo2004#0000
im down to be honest, i already set up a base on thalassa c


[05-Feb-25 08:28 PM] garoo2004#0000
but im not sure if i cant make 100% INC, since im also planning to put some RIG for my farm


[05-Feb-25 08:28 PM] garoo2004#0000
plus to fully develop it would cost me 2m


[05-Feb-25 08:31 PM] garoo2004#0000
so how about it? i may leave some spaces for my RIG as well, but for the most part ill build INC

So I've come up with my first draft of a plan as can be seen here. It's a DW production site on 1 permit of space. According to the planner and the info I put in I should see a profit of around 48k/day. I didn't assign experts, however and even distribution between FI and RE will scale evenly.

you'd see they have negative profit


[07-Feb-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000
using EXT on deimos is not a bad idea, it heavily reduce shipping cost


[07-Feb-25 11:09 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Ok, updated. focusing on AL as the good to sell


[07-Feb-25 11:09 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Just gotta refine it a bit (the plan)

how much time will it take to fill your storage ?


[07-Feb-25 11:17 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Less than a week, but I can use warehouses locally to store goods if need be


[07-Feb-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
The answer is 2 days

After the construction costs there should be about a weeks worth of operating costs covered too.


[07-Feb-25 11:46 AM] roche3950#0000
Players usually don’t advise multipermitting a planet iirc, as each single permit gives you +250 area on the same planet as opposed to +500 on a different planet

then again, my current steady-state plan relies on a lot of multipermitting so who am I to talk


[07-Feb-25 11:46 AM] laaxus#0000
good catch, didn't see that


[07-Feb-25 11:46 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, you should do one permit


[07-Feb-25 11:46 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I like the idea of having 1-2 bases (promitor to make Carbon to reduce costs)


[07-Feb-25 11:46 AM] laaxus#0000
anyway, you should not put your entire grant into buildings


[07-Feb-25 11:47 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'll fix that


[07-Feb-25 11:47 AM] laaxus#0000
you should keep a money buffer


[07-Feb-25 11:47 AM] roche3950#0000
You can invest those three permits into Deimos and two worlds in Thalassa


[07-Feb-25 11:47 AM] roche3950#0000
Set up an HYF and an INC world, and now you make your own C for processing AL at Deimos


[07-Feb-25 11:48 AM] laaxus#0000
please don't invest in hyf the roi is terrible lol


[07-Feb-25 11:52 AM] roche3950#0000
Was thinking from a simplified logistics angle 🙂 but sure, you can also buy the plants and burn them


[07-Feb-25 11:56 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Updated to be 1 permit. Still positive ALO with 4 experts, eventually 5 extraction 1 metallurgy once I can have 6. Do-able with 3 experts easy enough

only 11 plots left on Deimos currently


[07-Feb-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
you should use the FLX recipe


[07-Feb-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000
which is much more profitable


[07-Feb-25 12:01 PM] laaxus#0000

[07-Feb-25 01:02 PM] laaxus#0000
Yes, you should have your base, around one trip worth of input goods, and a money buffer


[07-Feb-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
Which usually means you dont get to build a full base right away


[07-Feb-25 01:03 PM] mzevilcanadian#0000
about a 180k money buffer and 1 ship worth of materials


[08-Feb-25 02:06 AM] plague_monk#0000
Hello everyone! Started playing a few days ago and i'm absolutely in love with this game. My corp is located on Deimos and I already have basic metallurgy buildings on it + COL. Looking to expand it and return the grant in the future. Heres a plan

[08-Feb-25 02:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Hello, and welcome 🙂
Is the plan you've posted your current setup, or your expansion plan for the grant?


[08-Feb-25 02:23 AM] plague_monk#0000
the plan I posted is my expansion plan. I currently have 3x HB1, EXT, COL, SME + all luxury needed for pioneers for 10 days


[08-Feb-25 02:24 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the grant can easily finance a full permit base (500 space), so you should aim for that


[08-Feb-25 02:25 AM] pxlfox.#0000
most people target a daily profit for a full permit around 50k - everything more is good, everything less is not desirable


[08-Feb-25 02:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it's not wrong to collect your own O on Deimos, but Deimos has a really low yield in comparison to other planets, making your "local" O not that profitable. I played a bit with your configuration, and I don't see it viable to do so. You might want to consider just extracting ALO, smelt it to AL and import O. FLX and C


[08-Feb-25 02:29 AM] plague_monk#0000
Understood, I'll correct my plan, thank you very much


[08-Feb-25 02:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I suggest to add a STO for extra storage. Especially, if you work with metals and ores, your planet storage will fill extremly fast.


[08-Feb-25 02:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
you can click the blue button in the overview card in PrunPlanner to see how long your storage will last

[08-Feb-25 02:34 AM] plague_monk#0000
I've updated my plan. It should leave me with enough money for initial imports and I have added Storage building and removed Collector


[08-Feb-25 02:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
you can even squeeze a little bit more out of the permit 😄


[08-Feb-25 02:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
add another EXT and SME


[08-Feb-25 02:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and a HB1


[08-Feb-25 02:36 AM] plague_monk#0000
I'm afraid that I'll be left with no money to import carbon and essentials to actually start making money


[08-Feb-25 02:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
that's fair


[08-Feb-25 02:37 AM] plague_monk#0000
Daily imports will be 45K


[08-Feb-25 02:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
let me see, what we can do

{Reactions}
🫡 

[08-Feb-25 02:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
if you use the #internal-offers, you can drop the construction costs down to around 700k, witch leaves you with 300k spare


[08-Feb-25 02:46 AM] laaxus#0000
I usually recommend 3/5 of the grant going for building, 1/5 for input goods, 1/5 as money buffer


[08-Feb-25 02:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I guess you still have the starter ships?


[08-Feb-25 02:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I mean, it would probably still work


[08-Feb-25 02:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
they will have to export every 1-2 days, so they can resupply in small quantities


[08-Feb-25 02:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
AL sells pretty good - I know even a guy, who will always take some 😂


[08-Feb-25 02:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
so they won't sit on capital


[08-Feb-25 02:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it's you decision, but I would still go for the full base and supply as much as my finances allow me. That gives you a little bit more momentum. But you can definitely go for the safer option and upgrade as soon as you collected the funds.


[08-Feb-25 02:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the plan looks otherwise fine for me.


[08-Feb-25 02:50 AM] laaxus#0000
Some people like to play tight


[08-Feb-25 02:50 AM] laaxus#0000
Other don't


[08-Feb-25 02:51 AM] laaxus#0000
I have 50 days worth of consummables in each of my bases for instance


[08-Feb-25 02:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I have 30 now, but will go up to 60 as soon as I can afford that


[08-Feb-25 02:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but as a new player, that's something you can think about in 4-8 weeks (or longer)


[08-Feb-25 02:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
7 days is already fine


[08-Feb-25 02:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
10 is good


[08-Feb-25 02:53 AM] plague_monk#0000
If I use Internal offers I should have a bit of wiggle room for any mistakes I may make


[08-Feb-25 02:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If notice you don't have enough money, just hit me up. We'll find a way to finance you, if needed 😉


[08-Feb-25 02:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Biggest beginner mistake is overestimating the liquidity of the market


[08-Feb-25 02:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Happened to everybody at least once


[08-Feb-25 02:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yeah - some markets tend to move slowly. But AL is quite liquid, so don't worry


[08-Feb-25 02:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
log in once a day, send your AL to the market, buy what you need, repeat


[08-Feb-25 02:56 AM] pxlfox.#0000
get familiar with the game, make some plans, talk to the people here, get roasted for stupid ideas, try again. After a few weeks you should have enough money for the next base


[08-Feb-25 02:58 AM] laaxus#0000
So many applicant, just the moment I can't give money away ><


[08-Feb-25 02:58 AM] plague_monk#0000
of course, not a problem


[08-Feb-25 02:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
you already have pro, @plague_monk ?


[08-Feb-25 02:59 AM] plague_monk#0000
I do, wanted to support the project


[08-Feb-25 02:59 AM] plague_monk#0000
I know I don't exactly need it atm


[08-Feb-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
great. It's unfortunately required for the grant, since you can't accept private contracts without it.


[08-Feb-25 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000
Oh maybe I have sitting capital on the cx


[08-Feb-25 03:00 AM] laaxus#0000
I'll check when I'm home


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Either way, as soon as somebody with money comes online and checks your plan, you'll probably get the grant approved.


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] plague_monk#0000
thank you a lot. I'll begin paying back immediately


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] plague_monk#0000
does 10% of my income sounds fair?


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] laaxus#0000
A grant is not a loan


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] tanda#0000
It's a grant, lol


[08-Feb-25 03:01 AM] pxlfox.#0000
there is no need to pay back the grant. Just be a healty part of this community, and all is fine


[08-Feb-25 03:02 AM] laaxus#0000

[08-Feb-25 03:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This game can be stupidly slow, especially in the beginnig. I have seen players playing for over a year with 2-3 bases. On the other hand, a lot of people here (who have been given a grant) are already over 5 bases in less then half a year.


[08-Feb-25 03:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Getting players started benefits the whole region - it stabilizes the markets and increases player retention.


[08-Feb-25 03:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, this program tries to educated new players, so they don't fall into common pitfalls.


[08-Feb-25 03:06 AM] plague_monk#0000
Thats incredibly generous


[08-Feb-25 03:08 AM] laaxus#0000
1M isn't much for older player


[08-Feb-25 03:08 AM] laaxus#0000
That's roughly my daily profit


[08-Feb-25 03:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Play the game, that's all we ask for!


[08-Feb-25 03:35 AM] plague_monk#0000
thank you again, I appreciate the help


[08-Feb-25 03:47 AM] plague_monk#0000
I have updated my plan (I've accidentally clicked "Include CM" option). Added extra EXT and SME and I should be left with 195K AIE to spare. That's about 4 days of imports covered. With a daily profit of 57K this should be enough to push me into autonomy


[08-Feb-25 03:47 AM] plague_monk#0000
Again, A huge thank you to this community for letting a new player reach this level of profit this early on

[08-Feb-25 10:16 AM] cactu55#0000
Is there anyway I could pay it forward?


[08-Feb-25 10:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
There's zero obligation, but you can pay out a grant yourself in the future 🙂


[08-Feb-25 10:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I'd focus on expansion first - ADI isn't going anywhere, and the best way you can help the project in the near term is by building more bases in Antares and getting rich in the process 😄


[08-Feb-25 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes


[08-Feb-25 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000
the best thing you can do for the ADI is expand


[08-Feb-25 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000
(and continue playing)


[08-Feb-25 10:19 AM] cactu55#0000
That's 100% something i'll do in the future!


[08-Feb-25 10:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
I got one of the first ADI grants over a year ago, and it was really rewarding when I was finally at a point where I could (sponsor? donate?) pay a grant out. It made for a fun reason to keep building more bases 😄

Financial systems sometimes/frequently use fixed point integers rather than floats for this reason 🙂


[09-Feb-25 11:52 AM] sidepipe#0000
We had a pretty big data pipeline at work that was using floats. The whole “floating point math is not associative” thing really became an issue when we were looking at the results

Hey all, I'm coming back from an involuntary COLIQ after letting my sub lapse (oops). I restarted on promitor before learning about the AGP, which is obviously a very interesting opportunity as a returning player.

While looking at the market history I noticed a recent and sustained increase in RAT prices, and I'm interested consumables production as a start this time. I'm still only two days in, so I'm looking for advice on pursuing the AGP via an expansion into Antares while keeping my free plot on prom vs COLIQ'ing again to restart in Antares.


[11-Feb-25 05:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
splitting up your bases by that much so early in the game is certainly not advisable, comes with many drawbacks when you only have 2 ships

Is that at all outweighed by the value of a plot on Promitor, or am I overestimating its value for food production? My understanding is that the only way to get a plot there is to start there.


[11-Feb-25 05:48 PM] jcheung#0000
involuntary? how far along were you before?


[11-Feb-25 05:49 PM] kaen7613#0000
about 2.5 months


[11-Feb-25 05:49 PM] jcheung#0000
promitor plot is pretty popular


[11-Feb-25 05:49 PM] kaen7613#0000
I had a moderately sized fuel production chain with my own H extraction on a second planet in CI


[11-Feb-25 05:50 PM] jcheung#0000
i feel like just your banked goods would have gotten you a better start 😛


[11-Feb-25 05:50 PM] kaen7613#0000
yeah well I really didn't have a choice


[11-Feb-25 05:50 PM] kaen7613#0000
I just logged in to the new player screen


[11-Feb-25 05:50 PM] jcheung#0000
oh


[11-Feb-25 05:51 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways


[11-Feb-25 05:51 PM] jcheung#0000
promitor isn't bad to keep


[11-Feb-25 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
it's pretty good if you want an agri world


[11-Feb-25 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
ANT isn't terribly far  away


[11-Feb-25 05:54 PM] jcheung#0000
what would you make in ANT if given the grant?


[11-Feb-25 05:55 PM] kaen7613#0000
I haven't done the math yet but my first idea was to ship produce to a food production world there


[11-Feb-25 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
that's probably going to not be a great idea. you're going to fully saturate your shipping capacity


[11-Feb-25 06:02 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd try looking at an independent production chain in antares for now. inter-CX shipping isn't very easy


[11-Feb-25 06:07 PM] kaen7613#0000
that makes a lot of sense. I'll look for a more coherent plan.


[11-Feb-25 06:17 PM] tanda#0000
Promitor has a rather large disadvantage for an ANT player of splitting your fleet early on


[11-Feb-25 06:18 PM] tanda#0000
it's a good agri planet, but I'm not buying into the bean hype


[11-Feb-25 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000
agreed. later game when it makes sense to have an inter-CX empire you have the capital to just use HYF for RAT & C


[11-Feb-25 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000
prom is powerful early game, but it's not necessary


[11-Feb-25 11:35 PM] sobyshka#0000
So. Sorry for a ping after a week but i left some info there: https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1293695249679650931/1339105421327204422


[11-Feb-25 11:35 PM] sobyshka#0000
We also need not 1 base but 3 actually.


[11-Feb-25 11:51 PM] vanarazor#0000
"Please don't feel restricted by the grant requiring approval of your plan, we simply want to help you avoid common pitfalls new players fall into."


[11-Feb-25 11:52 PM] vanarazor#0000
funny you say that


[11-Feb-25 11:56 PM] vanarazor#0000
I feel like I'd like to discover the game my way, I already understood that diversifying production was not the most effective and fastest way to profit

 *how ever*

 I tend to appreciate that I just need 3more BBH and 40 MCG and I'll be able to produce metals without he need to buy C or O  and close to produce DW and RAT as well


[11-Feb-25 11:56 PM] laaxus#0000
Then I recommend you learn to use prunplanner and test potential based


[11-Feb-25 11:56 PM] vanarazor#0000
I'm sure your experience will drastically improve my profit but taste would be missing of the menu


[11-Feb-25 11:57 PM] laaxus#0000
I gave a few ideas in the pinned


[11-Feb-25 11:58 PM] laaxus#0000
And there are more ideas to test in the link


[11-Feb-25 11:58 PM] laaxus#0000
Personnaly, I made a prunplanner plan for every possible base


[12-Feb-25 12:39 AM] jcheung#0000
you're more likely to find a backer if you present a plan that aligns with their views


[12-Feb-25 01:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I can’t read the intent and intonation of this message, so I’m not sure if you’re upset or just wanted to point that out.
Either way, you’re not limited to play the game you want to by the AGP. This is not a regularly body. Still, people tend to not want their money to be wasted. Providing a viable plan, that is profitable and allows you to finance further expansion gives them a little security, that their money isn’t going to waste.


[12-Feb-25 01:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I presented a plan to produce CU back then. Nobody wanted to finance it and I was a little bit upset to fallback to a plan basically everybody does.
But that didn’t stop me playing the game I wanted, but more enabled me to do so. 
Now I’m a proud CU producer and clearly understand, why nobody wanted to back my plan up. 😅😂

[12-Feb-25 01:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The moral of the story is simple. This game is slow. It takes months to setup a second base. This program cuts those endless waiting times, provides a secure income and enables you to actually play the game, instead of just wait for money to trickle in.


[12-Feb-25 01:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And besides, there are other loan options out there to finance your wildest dreams.


[12-Feb-25 01:19 AM] vanarazor#0000
Im not upset or anything, just a little bit on the defense.. I literally just started the game 4 days ago. I usually appreciate to discover the game by myself, I hear what you are saying but the fun for me is to find things by myself and makes mistakes if needed, otherwise, what's the point of the game.

players with more experience will come and tell how to have the most profitable trajectory, yet I feel like they are stealing the fun you might have along the way


[12-Feb-25 01:21 AM] vanarazor#0000
I understand that people want their money to be useful and not wasted. that' a fair point. I though the 1M AIC came as philanthropy and in a sort of contract


[12-Feb-25 01:21 AM] laaxus#0000
It's just that prun is a game where you Can litterally bankrupt yourself


[12-Feb-25 01:21 AM] vanarazor#0000
next thing is going to be we need your planet to be only producing one ressource because of ... you actually can;t even understand the bigger picture yet


[12-Feb-25 01:22 AM] laaxus#0000
So it's very important to have at lease a secure bases earning safe profits early on


[12-Feb-25 01:22 AM] laaxus#0000
And there aren't a lot of variety for that


[12-Feb-25 01:23 AM] laaxus#0000
At the end of the day, the AGP isn't some kind of shady organisation

[12-Feb-25 01:24 AM] laaxus#0000
You just need to convince someone that you're worth their 1M


[12-Feb-25 01:25 AM] vanarazor#0000
thanks, yeah I think I'm not ready for the streets, I'll bankrupt myself if I need to


[12-Feb-25 01:26 AM] laaxus#0000
Anyway enjoy the game the way you desires


[12-Feb-25 01:26 AM] laaxus#0000
No need to take the grant if you don't want to


[12-Feb-25 01:26 AM] laaxus#0000
A few people don't take it


[12-Feb-25 01:27 AM] laaxus#0000
You're not restricted from the other part of the Adi either


[12-Feb-25 01:27 AM] laaxus#0000
(I'd recommend looking at the internal market)

I didn’t take a grant, I got a loan instead lol. But I think I had played around about a month before I  really jumped into any stuff here in ADI


[12-Feb-25 01:29 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah I do think I 've arrived here too early


[12-Feb-25 01:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Nah I don’t think that’s the case


[12-Feb-25 01:30 AM] laaxus#0000
Coming into the ADI early was the best decision I made


[12-Feb-25 01:30 AM] laaxus#0000
You won't regret it


[12-Feb-25 01:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think I would’ve lost interest in the game


[12-Feb-25 01:46 AM] jcheung#0000
i came out the gate with both a loan and a grant 🤗

[12-Feb-25 06:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But I got my AL base on Deimos
financed with it - good times 🙂


[12-Feb-25 07:26 AM] jvaler#0000
i mean the CU probably *would* have sold... eventually =P


[12-Feb-25 07:53 AM] razesdark#0000
I sold 1400 CU last night alone...(never mind that it didnt really sell for ages, that is just details)


[12-Feb-25 08:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I’m not sure about the heavy metal markets. They are extremely limited by their transportation requirements, that people tend to produce them on site. That might change tho with the new HCB.
Also, you don’t need as much of CU and AU as of e.g. AL, so the demand is lower. 
And CU is probably over-inflated due to the gateway hoarders (SP), which will stop eventually as soon as they have there stock levels reached.


[12-Feb-25 08:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And, since metals are low-tier materials, margins on them aren’t desirable. Combined with the high transportation requirements, you get the current market prices 😅


[12-Feb-25 08:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
(which are at least for CU sinking, since many people jumped onto it when it was like 100k profit a day)


[12-Feb-25 08:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also something you shouldn’t do as a newer player - having stock just sitting on the market


[12-Feb-25 08:23 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Markets like AL, C, RAT and DW are optimal, because you can quickly liquidate the materials.


[12-Feb-25 08:23 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sitting on PWO, PT, CU and AU isn’t really practical, when you only have cash to restock for a few days


[12-Feb-25 11:06 AM] tanda#0000
SP will be required for gateway maintenance


[12-Feb-25 11:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We’ll see. Gateways aren’t at the horizon and many gateways are already funded.


[13-Feb-25 10:02 PM] vanarazor#0000
Okay I am ready

[13-Feb-25 10:09 PM] survivorbob#0000
It's a building that adds 5k/5k local storage in exchange for 15 area. Having at least 1 is useful for most builds


[13-Feb-25 10:10 PM] jvaler#0000
currently that build will reach max storage in just 3 days


[13-Feb-25 10:10 PM] jvaler#0000
not very sustainable


[13-Feb-25 10:13 PM] jvaler#0000
also phobos resource deposits are pretty bad. i suppose it at least works, but the numbers are pretty meh

Hi, I'm looking to start the grant program process but have no clue where to begin except for the website that was mentioned (prunplanner). I'd like to focus on drilling for ores and smelting them as the primary focus. Right now I have access to aluminium so any pointers would be appreciated. 🙂


[14-Feb-25 12:25 PM] laaxus#0000
take a look at #agp-information


[14-Feb-25 12:25 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
✅


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
the usual process is that you suggest a base (the way you'd spend your grant)


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
and we will have a back and forth discussion


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
and once somebody is convinced its grant won't be wasted, he gives it to you


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Oh okay, so it's pretty open ended then


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
the main goal is to make you avoid common pitfall


[14-Feb-25 12:26 PM] laaxus#0000
yes


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000
tho we'd heavily recommend producing something with a high liquidity


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000
(avoid cu)


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
CU?


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000
there are three commands you need to learn :
BUI
MAT
BRA


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] laaxus#0000
(CXM if you have pro)


[14-Feb-25 12:27 PM] realharvey#0000
We do not want to tell you what to do, but we want to make sure that you have one base that is able to generate you decent profit which enables you to do what your heart desires

[14-Feb-25 12:31 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
I see what you mean about that liquidity. Copper doesn't move a lot in a day compared to something like aluminium, even though the price is higher. You could make way more on AL before the market runs dry on CU


[14-Feb-25 12:32 PM] laaxus#0000
The point is, your cash is low


[14-Feb-25 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000
so you have to sell your output good


[14-Feb-25 12:33 PM] laaxus#0000
so that you can buy your input good


[14-Feb-25 12:33 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Right, but if there's nowhere to sell then you've got a BIG problem


[14-Feb-25 12:34 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, hence why I recommend this cx settings

[14-Feb-25 12:35 PM] laaxus#0000
which is a floor for profit


[14-Feb-25 12:35 PM] laaxus#0000
selling into the bid


[14-Feb-25 12:35 PM] laaxus#0000
it's **excellent** for new players


[14-Feb-25 12:35 PM] laaxus#0000
and very good for medium old players

[14-Feb-25 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looks pretty reasonable, although I'd probably recommend importing the O rather than getting it from Deimos. With various boosts, dedicated oxygen planets will get 3x better efficiency per building.


[14-Feb-25 02:11 PM] vanarazor#0000
any experts available to boost productivity?


[14-Feb-25 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, good suggestion. Your first few experts will come pretty quick so I'd probably put 3 or 4 experts into metallurgy on that plan.


[14-Feb-25 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
That might change how the materials balance


[14-Feb-25 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can swap those COL for more SME and see if your profit of 42k goes up or down


[14-Feb-25 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's reasonable to diversify on your first planet though, it's more fun than specializing. so I don't push back too hard on the COL or the INC


[14-Feb-25 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Overall a good plan 🙂


[14-Feb-25 02:19 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Looks like I've got 2 metallurgy experts


[14-Feb-25 02:22 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
I'll be able to get about 2k AIC extra without the collectors


[14-Feb-25 02:27 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
This looks pretty solid now https://i.gyazo.com/67fbc595eefca42c29aaaa22f696cd8e.png

[14-Feb-25 02:28 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
My only concern with this config is that my profits would be more directly tied to my input costs since I'm not manufacturing some of those


[14-Feb-25 02:28 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
But that extra 8k AIC profit per day does look pretty nice


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
i'd remove one permit


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Hmm... Also some other considerations is that while this new config is technically more "profitable", it's much higher in input costs so the cashflow goes more to expenses percentage-wise compared to the previous picture I sent. Not *as* efficient


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
people usually recommend to stay at 1 permit per base


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
but at first, it's not bad


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
it's just a good habit to take


[14-Feb-25 02:32 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Why is that?


[14-Feb-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
permit becomes the main limiter to exponential growth past lvl 20


[14-Feb-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
a permit cost very little at first


[14-Feb-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
then it grows to 10 50 100 500 millions


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] laaxus#0000
so yeah


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Woah


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] laaxus#0000
(at first, you'll want to maximise ROI


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] laaxus#0000
then you'll want to maximise PROFIT / PERMIT


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
yeah, eventually the buildings are basically free next to the permits.


[14-Feb-25 02:34 PM] laaxus#0000
this is on the premise that you want ot maximize your growth, you should do what's fun to you, even if not optimal


[14-Feb-25 02:35 PM] .shiva.#0000
you can do 6 EXT / 12 SME + 1 STO to start, which fits in 500 area. you'll be slightly negative on ALO past 3 Metallurgy experts


[14-Feb-25 02:36 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
What if I already took the permit to lvl 2 on my base in-game? :nervous:


[14-Feb-25 02:36 PM] .shiva.#0000
which is not a big deal, since your ships will be mostly empty going to the base


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
`BS` buffer lets you add/remove


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
you can easily remove and add it


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] laaxus#0000
no worry


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Oh, there's no penalty for downsizing? That's good to hear


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
As long as there's space I'm assuming


[14-Feb-25 02:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
yeah


[14-Feb-25 02:38 PM] .shiva.#0000
if you're above you have to deconstruct buildings to <=500 area


[14-Feb-25 02:38 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Makes sense


[14-Feb-25 02:40 PM] .shiva.#0000
one thing that's also worth checking out on bases is this button:

[14-Feb-25 02:41 PM] .shiva.#0000
that will show you how often you need to import/export materials, and how quickly your storage will fill up

[14-Feb-25 06:22 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Would it be a problem if my cost is under the 1 mil AIC grant amount? I suppose I could use the spare cash to buy supplies https://i.gyazo.com/65a7d57ebccdad032fd71b6ee3e0f06e.png

[14-Feb-25 06:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not a problem at all


[14-Feb-25 06:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it would be a good idea to use  some of the money for the base and supplies


[14-Feb-25 06:26 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Well I suppose in that case, this is pretty much ready to submit then unless anyone has additional feedback to provide


[14-Feb-25 06:28 PM] rj_rayjay#0000

[14-Feb-25 06:30 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Hmm... But if my ship is 500m3 I'd assume that would actually be exporting every 1.5 days to keep up with production


[14-Feb-25 06:31 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
Thankfully I have 2 ships of that size, and it takes about a day round trip to reach the exchange


[14-Feb-25 06:31 PM] .shiva.#0000
yeah, that's kinda just how SME bases go


[14-Feb-25 06:31 PM] .shiva.#0000
once you get a WCB (1k/3k ship upgrade) it's much better


[14-Feb-25 06:32 PM] rj_rayjay#0000
It's actually kinda nice, when I first started the game I queued up my first production and practically had nothing to do for about 12 hours LOL


[14-Feb-25 09:22 PM] jcheung#0000
generally you want to keep some "oh shit i screwed up" money and some "i need to supply my base" money


[14-Feb-25 09:23 PM] jcheung#0000
can i get a share link for that base?


[14-Feb-25 09:23 PM] jcheung#0000
it's view only if you're worried about me breaking something

[14-Feb-25 09:34 PM] jcheung#0000
ok. so by no means do you have to do this, but i would consider dropping a SME for another STO


[14-Feb-25 09:35 PM] jcheung#0000
gives you more time to do other things with your ships, or be lazy about collecting


[14-Feb-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
on the other hand, that setup with only 1 STO isn't terrible on shipping and fill time, and you don't have the funds to fill 'er up for like 20 days anyways


[15-Feb-25 12:00 AM] vanarazor#0000

Hey, here are my 2x plans for the first Base. 1st https://prunplanner.org/shared/74667525-e683-4358-8ac1-57ee6e451417 It is a pure metal manufacturing base. The advantage is high profit and kept simple. The disadvantage is regular purchases and micromanagement. 2st https://prunplanner.org/shared/2bdf4f0d-b02d-4d95-93f1-ae3ca6616a13 It is certainly not intentional, but I have tried to build everything relatively autonomously. Consumables excluded. The advantage would be less shopping and therefore less micromanagement, but the disadvantage would be less profit. These were the only ideas I had so far and I am always open to tips! 🙂

[15-Feb-25 10:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If you ask me, go for the base with the higher profit. I guess its your first base. You can use both of your ships for the logistics. Higher profits mean you can expand faster

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Feb-25 10:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, I'll echo Pxlfox's thoughts there. I'm guessing the specialized plan does better. And you will have more than 2 experts in no time.


[15-Feb-25 10:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also be sure to add the luxury goods for your pioneers, so their efficiency goes from 79% to 100%, it more than pays for the cost of the goods


[15-Feb-25 10:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Other than those tips, this sounds good and I'll send your grant!


[15-Feb-25 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also looks good to me and I'll send your grant. Very siimilar to Xerwantes plan

[15-Feb-25 03:06 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
ok, whats the next step? honestly dont trust Prun Planner to give accurate numbers right no so Im setting up a spread sheet for the expantion cost


[15-Feb-25 03:07 PM] laaxus#0000
ok, why do you think prunplanner doesn't give you accurate numbers ?


[15-Feb-25 03:07 PM] laaxus#0000
you can chose the numbers you want in cx settings


[15-Feb-25 03:08 PM] laaxus#0000
you can even hardcode them if you'd rather that


[15-Feb-25 03:09 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
it shorted me mats for both my bases and not by a little


[15-Feb-25 03:13 PM] laaxus#0000
that's probably because you didn't put correct CX settings


[15-Feb-25 03:13 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
I used ben, and set it as such


[15-Feb-25 03:14 PM] laaxus#0000
jsut setting ben isn't enough


[15-Feb-25 03:14 PM] laaxus#0000
did you put buy at buy ?


[15-Feb-25 03:14 PM] laaxus#0000
at sell at sell ?


[15-Feb-25 03:14 PM] laaxus#0000
avg is the last value sold, so it's worthless


[15-Feb-25 03:16 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
yes-out of the planned 20 SME's, 8 HB1's and 1 STO  It ended up only being enough mats for about 6 SME's, 5 HB1's and the 1 STO


[15-Feb-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm sorry to say that it is a you error


[15-Feb-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
prunplanner is VERY accurate


[15-Feb-25 03:16 PM] laaxus#0000
this just means you didn't put the correct settings

[15-Feb-25 03:19 PM] laaxus#0000
I use it to verify  that my sheet has no math mistake


[15-Feb-25 03:19 PM] laaxus#0000
If any value on my sheet is different from prunplanner


[15-Feb-25 03:19 PM] laaxus#0000
then it's a sheet issue, not a prunplanner issue


[15-Feb-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not saying you HAVE to use prunplanner


[15-Feb-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
using a sheet is perfectly fine


[15-Feb-25 03:20 PM] laaxus#0000
but don't say that prunplanner is inaccurate, because it's wrong


[15-Feb-25 03:21 PM] laaxus#0000
and I'd recommend using prunplanner to double check your sheet, to be sure you've not done any mistake


[15-Feb-25 03:22 PM] laaxus#0000
(and again you can hardcode any price)


[15-Feb-25 03:23 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
the numbers prun planner overshot MCG and undershot HSE by a few hundred for the setup on YI-280d wen buying from ben


[15-Feb-25 03:24 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
- no i did not set sell ammount, just buy for the mats


[15-Feb-25 03:30 PM] tanda#0000
Across 20 bases, Prun planner has never failed to tell me the correct mats. Something else happened


[15-Feb-25 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
are you sure that you bought the right amounts?


[15-Feb-25 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
do you have open asks?


[15-Feb-25 03:31 PM] jcheung#0000
i have, but it's because i put in the wrong number of habs 😜


[15-Feb-25 03:31 PM] laaxus#0000
Same


[15-Feb-25 03:32 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
no open asks,- but thinking there might be another issue because it wont share the CX settings


[15-Feb-25 03:45 PM] vanarazor#0000
could be cache issue, planner page needs to be reloaded after CX settings saved


[15-Feb-25 03:47 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
didnt think of that, turned off cache for web browsing


[15-Feb-25 04:22 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
can someone double check the numbers?

[15-Feb-25 04:29 PM] vanarazor#0000
I'm **new** here, so take my words lightly but if you construction plan is to get from: 
- 13FP  to 18FP (or build 5) 
- 39RIG to 51RIG (or build 12 )
- 17 HB1 to 23 HB1 (or build 6)
_then_ that built-in table seems to be **accurate**, as for the cost, I believe you 'll to make sure the right CX settings is selected

Ps: you specified having 863 MCG and 4 BSE in stock


[15-Feb-25 04:33 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
adding RIG, FP, and HB1's based off of ben CX


[15-Feb-25 04:34 PM] angrygrunt85#0000

about setup for perm trade partners on the DW and H2O

{Reactions}
🫡 

[17-Feb-25 11:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So 5 more MP 12 more rig and 6 more HB1


[17-Feb-25 11:38 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
this expantion will allow for more trade on both the DW and H2O while supplying poth partners with there needs


[17-Feb-25 11:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Aren’t you making about 10 extra water per day?


[17-Feb-25 11:41 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
should be a bit more than that, the contract i have is for 10k


[17-Feb-25 11:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok technically it’s 2026 but you use 2010 per day


[17-Feb-25 11:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
(I’m not trying to rag on your plan or anything just want to understand, and then set you up for success)


[17-Feb-25 11:47 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
16 H2O x 7 days is a bit slim if this contract turns in to a perm trade , increasing output will allow for greater production per run  allowing me to fill the order while DW is still cooking


[17-Feb-25 11:48 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I mean you could do the water contract but you would only have 4k water for the whole week for yourself


[17-Feb-25 11:48 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
532 DW/w is currently doable but doesnt leave me much for CX

I’m just going off of the numbers here from your plan


[17-Feb-25 11:50 AM] .urpalhal#0000
In is how much you use, out is how much you produce and delta is the difference


[17-Feb-25 11:50 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
supplying my 2 bases with the DW on top of the contract leaves roughly an exess of 150-200u for CX


[17-Feb-25 11:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok cool cool


[17-Feb-25 11:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
And you’re selling the H2O as well?


[17-Feb-25 11:53 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
yes


[17-Feb-25 11:54 AM] angrygrunt85#0000
that is if i have exess H2O to sell outside of contracts


[17-Feb-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m not sure you’ll have much excess to begin with


[17-Feb-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Your FP are only going to make DW?


[17-Feb-25 12:03 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
yes


[17-Feb-25 12:05 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
thanks for that catch

change that from 13 FP and 39 RIG to 12 and 40

You’ll be making 222/d so about 1409 per week


[17-Feb-25 12:19 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
puts the fulfilment at 45 days for 10k...


[17-Feb-25 01:50 PM] angrygrunt85#0000
ok so the perm trade is confirmed, 46 days for 10k H2O, and weekly shipments of DW, on top of supplying my 2 bases leaves roughly 600-700u/d DW for the CX after the expantion

can you screenshot the "new order" screen on your SME

ohh thats it the HQ Bonus is 25% -.-


[18-Feb-25 11:11 AM] jab.sh#0000
you can probably make it work by switching your experts to resource extraction

how i can set in the planner the HQ Bonus?

Not that


[18-Feb-25 11:19 AM] kelvinfu#0000
You won't have an HQ bonus I think? I'm assuming that Deimos is your only planet


[18-Feb-25 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
You're based in Antares, so your HQ gives you a small bonus to electronics. By only using 1 of 3 permits, it is a slightly larger than 10% bonus. But only for electronics. And you don't have a corp HQ.


[18-Feb-25 11:19 AM] jab.sh#0000

[18-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
So "Metallurgy" COGC is correct, your experts is probably correct.


[18-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Make sure you are using the recipe with FLX:

[18-Feb-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
The one without FLX is faster but  you get less AL. It might account for the difference in ALO consumption between the plans


[18-Feb-25 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also as you get resource extraction experts, slot those in too. Your end ratio will be 5 metallurgy, 1 resource extraction, but you might be at 4 / 2 until you get your 5th metallurgy


[18-Feb-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also if the base is new you might not have your full workforce. The ratio should be maintained though. 🤷‍♂️


[18-Feb-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, share screenshots of your two PRODCO buffers, so we can see those percentages


[18-Feb-25 11:24 AM] klick_i#0000
ok i confirm the wrong bonus in metallurgy. It is the electronic bonus.

[18-Feb-25 11:30 AM] kelvinfu#0000
The no flx recipe will put you at a deficit of ALO.

That should be right


[18-Feb-25 11:30 AM] klick_i#0000
and its more worth to use this recipe?


[18-Feb-25 11:31 AM] kelvinfu#0000

so in the case you would be chekcing the box

for OOG we have an HQ on Nike so my PP2's get a boost there


[27-Feb-25 05:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
or for CULT they have one on Origo so they would get a boost there

Yeah ANT is getting the manufacutring and SIO extraction.


[28-Feb-25 03:46 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I plan to use my starter ships to haul the MCG and LST as WCBs.


[28-Feb-25 03:47 AM] jcheung#0000
there's several major flaws with phobos though


[28-Feb-25 03:47 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Do tell


[28-Feb-25 03:49 AM] jcheung#0000
first, and probably most importantly, the SIO yield is not great there. Norwick or Hyalos would be about double the yield and are only 3-4 jumps away, and all green (yk-649b and wu-070a respectively)
second, you aren't using luxuries-you should always be using PWO... and usually COF as well
third, you have no experts assigned-starting planning with 3 is usually a good idea because you get those first 3 fairly quickly


[28-Feb-25 03:50 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Those are great points. I totally forgot what you mentioned.


[28-Feb-25 03:50 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I however dont think I can make the Norwick or Hyalos work. I considered those, but I would simply not be able to gather the capital I think for those FTL ships.


[28-Feb-25 03:51 AM] jcheung#0000
you're planning on putting together STL ships for this?


[28-Feb-25 03:51 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Just between the two bases.


[28-Feb-25 03:51 AM] jcheung#0000
why not use starters


[28-Feb-25 03:51 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I figured it would be cheaper?


[28-Feb-25 03:51 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I need those to haul the LST.


[28-Feb-25 03:52 AM] jcheung#0000
where's the second base


[28-Feb-25 03:52 AM] jcheung#0000
you better not be trying to get LST from 572c


[28-Feb-25 03:52 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Heph


[28-Feb-25 03:52 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Why not


[28-Feb-25 03:53 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I wondered if I shouldnt because of the travel time.


[28-Feb-25 03:54 AM] jcheung#0000
travel time will be like a week round trip


[28-Feb-25 03:54 AM] runawayfighter#0000

[28-Feb-25 03:54 AM] runawayfighter#0000

i can offer you a slightly better spot though.


[28-Feb-25 03:55 AM] jcheung#0000
nike is about 9% lower yield, but is only a day (or less) away from ANT CX


[28-Feb-25 03:55 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I dont think its a week, but I dont have FIO to check the flight planner. My FIO login says I already have one.

at a minimum it'll be 4 day round trip for you burning hard


[28-Feb-25 03:57 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe 3 day


[28-Feb-25 03:57 AM] jcheung#0000
but


[28-Feb-25 03:57 AM] jcheung#0000
you would have to make 3 trips a day in a starter ship to keep up with the extractors


[28-Feb-25 03:58 AM] jcheung#0000
you are physically incapable of such things.

[28-Feb-25 03:58 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Nike is a better spot.


[28-Feb-25 03:59 AM] jcheung#0000
what kind of capital do you have now without the grant?


[28-Feb-25 03:59 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I have one million from my friend Nicster. And my friend Gladi from my corp said he would loan or grant me an undisclosed amount.


[28-Feb-25 04:00 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I would have a WCB ship though


[28-Feb-25 04:01 AM] jcheung#0000
i will say that MCG isn't the most profitable thing you could be making, but i'm also not going to stop you.

what i do recommend, should you want to continue this path is to just start with hep, and plan to buy feedstock from the CX to start, at least as far as AGP goes


[28-Feb-25 04:01 AM] jcheung#0000
after this base is established, you can then work on sourcing SIO and LST


[28-Feb-25 04:01 AM] runawayfighter#0000
And the beauty of the STL is that I can deliver it straight to CX too. I dont need to pay a heavy price for the ship.


[28-Feb-25 04:01 AM] jcheung#0000
the cost of a STL ship is not significantly less than a FTL ship


[28-Feb-25 04:02 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Ah. I was never an experienced player. What does AGP mean?


[28-Feb-25 04:02 AM] jcheung#0000
look at the channel you're in 😉


[28-Feb-25 04:02 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Oh LOL


[28-Feb-25 04:02 AM] runawayfighter#0000
hahahah


[28-Feb-25 04:03 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Would I trade the feedstock?


[28-Feb-25 04:03 AM] runawayfighter#0000
What is feedstock. Like agriculture products?


[28-Feb-25 04:03 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Im confused.


[28-Feb-25 04:03 AM] jcheung#0000
feedstock is material consumed to produce goods in a factory


[28-Feb-25 04:04 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Ah okay.


[28-Feb-25 04:04 AM] jcheung#0000
so LST and SIO would be a MCG factory's feedstock


[28-Feb-25 04:04 AM] jcheung#0000
generally it's raw or semi-processed material


[28-Feb-25 04:04 AM] jcheung#0000
like ore, or bar stock, or stuff like that


[28-Feb-25 04:05 AM] jcheung#0000
hmmm. okay, so i think i was mistaken about how much FTL costs


[28-Feb-25 04:06 AM] jcheung#0000
so you would save roughly a third of the cost, maybe


[28-Feb-25 04:06 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Thats great.


[28-Feb-25 04:06 AM] jcheung#0000
but in exchange that ship is stuck


[28-Feb-25 04:06 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Well Okay I guess.


[28-Feb-25 04:07 AM] runawayfighter#0000
You can still fly to the CX from system right at ANT?


[28-Feb-25 04:07 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Yeah. it's stuck


[28-Feb-25 04:07 AM] jcheung#0000
yes, you can reach hep, phobos, cx with stl ship


[28-Feb-25 04:08 AM] jcheung#0000
the main issue is your EXT base for LST is going to also be very shipping heavy, and would benefit from a WCB as well


[28-Feb-25 04:09 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Yeah.


[28-Feb-25 04:10 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I rememebr back in the day raising capital was hard.


[28-Feb-25 04:10 AM] jcheung#0000
hmm. i think it would be cutting it close, but if you slapped FTL on a WCB you should be able to service LST at nike, SIO at... well, phobos for now, and deliver to hep


[28-Feb-25 04:10 AM] runawayfighter#0000
I had to message the entire server


[28-Feb-25 04:10 AM] jcheung#0000
utilization would be close to max though


[28-Feb-25 04:11 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Do you know the flight time?


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] jcheung#0000
oh. i just noticed that your plans are 2 permit plans


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] jcheung#0000
second and third permits add only 250 area each


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] runawayfighter#0000
yeah?


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] jcheung#0000
just wanted to make sure you're aware of that


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] jcheung#0000
use BLU


[28-Feb-25 04:12 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Ah thanks!


[28-Feb-25 04:14 AM] jcheung#0000
i gotta go, but do continue to talk through what you want to do


[28-Feb-25 04:14 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Okay. I have to go too. Its really late. Its actually morning now.


[28-Feb-25 04:15 AM] jcheung#0000
anything i've said so far is my opinion, and you are free to completely disregard it, but i hope you consider some of the things i've said


[28-Feb-25 04:15 AM] jcheung#0000
what, who could have seen that coming

[28-Feb-25 04:15 AM] runawayfighter#0000
No, they're all good points. Nike is a better spot. I forgot some things too like the consumables.


[28-Feb-25 04:15 AM] runawayfighter#0000
Haha! Good Morning

hi


[28-Feb-25 10:29 AM] inspirity#0000
how to move to antares


[28-Feb-25 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, in your situation, it might be easier to coliq and restart in antares


[28-Feb-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
but you can build a base roughly anywhere, as long as you have the materials and the planet has availabel plot


[28-Feb-25 10:49 AM] inspirity#0000
yeah idk how to restart either 🤣


[28-Feb-25 10:50 AM] .urpalhal#0000
In a buffer type COLIQ and then hit yes I’m sure button


[28-Feb-25 10:58 AM] inspirity#0000
ok ty


[28-Feb-25 10:58 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Just know there isn’t any fertile planets quite like promitor over here


[28-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
He started as metalurgist on promitor


[28-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
so I think a restart was necessary anyway


[28-Feb-25 10:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oooh


[28-Feb-25 10:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah we’re the kings of metallurgy


[28-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Promitor is indeed the best starting planet
but, in my opinion, this doesn't matter at all mid to  late game


[28-Feb-25 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
and we're here to speed you up to mid game anyway


[28-Feb-25 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
there's no FOMO to have


[28-Feb-25 11:01 AM] inspirity#0000

[28-Feb-25 11:07 AM] inspirity#0000

[28-Feb-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000
that's because you have to redo the tutorial again


[28-Feb-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000

[28-Feb-25 11:08 AM] inspirity#0000

[28-Feb-25 11:08 AM] inspirity#0000
but idk what its forcing me to do now to unlock the other tabs like trading


[28-Feb-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000

this is what i have rn


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
as an FYI there is a building that can be built on planets called the CoGC and that boosts one industry's productivity and phobos' is for electronics and deimos is for metalurgy


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] inspirity#0000
im on phobos iirc


[28-Feb-25 02:44 PM] inspirity#0000
so do i need to select electronics?


[28-Feb-25 02:45 PM] inspirity#0000
yeah im on phobos


[28-Feb-25 02:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000

as a metallurgist, you should start on deimos

[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] laaxus#0000
yes,  because only new players can make a base there


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Isn't the coliq timer a month


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] laaxus#0000
if you start on phobos, you won't be able to make a base on deimos


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no? i think it gets longer and longer


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] laaxus#0000
it's worth coliqing tbh


[28-Feb-25 02:51 PM] laaxus#0000
(don't worry, I coliqed 4 times, you're not out of the norms)


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
Stop advising this. Make solid plans first, then coliq


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] laaxus#0000
true


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] jcheung#0000
Not shotgun coliq and figure things out later


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] laaxus#0000
sorry i'm tired and exhausted from recent political events, so I think I'll go to sleep


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
gn


[28-Feb-25 02:52 PM] moke.#0000
Can absolutely get a base on Demios


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
no? we are 6 plots over max


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] laaxus#0000
but yes, please do plan


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] moke.#0000
Right this second, no


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ohh i see what you mean


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but that is not certain


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] inspirity#0000
ok dw i got my stuff back on deimos now


[28-Feb-25 02:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
ok


[28-Feb-25 02:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
now do deimos plan


[28-Feb-25 02:54 PM] laaxus#0000
any way, you should plan
this game is 90% about planning


[28-Feb-25 02:54 PM] laaxus#0000
95% even


[28-Feb-25 02:54 PM] moke.#0000
If you *really* want one, it just takes some time and preplanning. I think I had CM materials sitting there for a week and a half for it to dip from +10.

[28-Feb-25 02:54 PM] igfloz#0000
Moke, is correct - I waited months before I created a Deimos base - but man! , did I move fast to set it up , lol


[28-Feb-25 02:55 PM] igfloz#0000
...and I was lucky, I think there were 9 spaces when I joined Deimos


[28-Feb-25 02:55 PM] inspirity#0000
ok im gonna plan again


[28-Feb-25 02:55 PM] inspirity#0000
now for deimos

can someone help how i go from here for the plan


[28-Feb-25 03:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so uh


[28-Feb-25 03:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you could make 20 SME


[28-Feb-25 03:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you could do 17 SME with 3 COL for O


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] inspirity#0000
for mass AL production?


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you could mix it up


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] inspirity#0000
ill try that


[28-Feb-25 03:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
you could add HWP and make LHP


[28-Feb-25 03:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
there are people here who could help you get some ALO on Deimos


[28-Feb-25 03:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
like they sell it in #internal-offers


[28-Feb-25 03:06 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[28-Feb-25 03:06 PM] inspirity#0000
let me figure out the AL production first


[28-Feb-25 03:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that box can help narrow down buildings that match the COGC

[28-Feb-25 03:07 PM] inspirity#0000
i think i did sum wrong


[28-Feb-25 03:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
EvoV will probably buy any and all AL you make straight from deimo

[28-Feb-25 03:07 PM] inspirity#0000
ohh i made 4 orders


[28-Feb-25 03:08 PM] inspirity#0000
its still a month xD


[28-Feb-25 03:09 PM] manhim#0000
Those are big orders. You should start with the smallest one and make them recurring until you run out of Pro


[28-Feb-25 03:10 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[28-Feb-25 03:10 PM] manhim#0000
Also, I'm thinking about switching production away from AL (half of my production) and into other things, but I still have a lot of ALO production, so if you want we could figure a deal where I can transport ALO to Deimos and sell to you directly to save on transport.


[28-Feb-25 03:11 PM] inspirity#0000
is this better

[28-Feb-25 03:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Uh idk that you have enough houses for all that


[28-Feb-25 03:11 PM] manhim#0000
I don't think that the COL is worth it on Deimos


[28-Feb-25 03:12 PM] inspirity#0000
good point


[28-Feb-25 03:12 PM] inspirity#0000
do i get more hb1 or hb2


[28-Feb-25 03:13 PM] igfloz#0000
👆 This is what ADI is about, planning / changing / encouraging trades, helping newer players get on the production ladder and move on......... I like your post. I salute you 🫡

[28-Feb-25 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So HB1 are for pioneer


[28-Feb-25 03:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Which is what you need


[28-Feb-25 03:14 PM] inspirity#0000
oh i thought hb2 was just more pioneer xD


[28-Feb-25 03:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No that is settlers


[28-Feb-25 03:15 PM] inspirity#0000
i got 12 hb1 for enough population, but now i dont have enough of this stuff

[28-Feb-25 03:15 PM] inspirity#0000
ty thats exactly what i needed


[28-Feb-25 03:16 PM] manhim#0000
Whenever I create a base, I setup my production, then click on Optimize, and usually I choose to optimize by Area.


[28-Feb-25 03:16 PM] manhim#0000
Some more complex bases might be better to optimize by cost though


[28-Feb-25 03:16 PM] inspirity#0000

[28-Feb-25 03:16 PM] inspirity#0000
how many permits do i start with or does it stay as just one


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] inspirity#0000
cuz then i dont have enough total thingy


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] manhim#0000
But yeah, you might have too many production buildings right now


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] inspirity#0000
could be that


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] inspirity#0000
ill remove some smelters


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] inspirity#0000
ok that worked


[28-Feb-25 03:17 PM] manhim#0000
I'd remove the COL first. Deimos isn't that optimal for O collecting


[28-Feb-25 03:18 PM] manhim#0000
And it's not the hardest to transport

[28-Feb-25 03:32 PM] manhim#0000
For each types of population, there are 2 luxury consumables that you can give to them for more efficiency


[28-Feb-25 03:33 PM] inspirity#0000
oh sick


[28-Feb-25 03:33 PM] manhim#0000
It's usually recommended to have them enabled


[28-Feb-25 03:33 PM] inspirity#0000
i figured aswell but i didnt know if it was an ingame consumable that i dont have access to yet


[28-Feb-25 03:34 PM] manhim#0000
Oh, nothing is locked in this game. Maybe except Experts that get unlocked over time.


[28-Feb-25 03:34 PM] inspirity#0000
good to know


[28-Feb-25 03:34 PM] manhim#0000
You'll see that your limiters are: money + shipping capacity (which is limited by money)


[28-Feb-25 03:35 PM] inspirity#0000
if i manage to get more ships in a month (I doubt it) will they stay after my pro expires


[28-Feb-25 03:36 PM] inspirity#0000
cuz that would make shipping capacity less of a problem


[28-Feb-25 03:36 PM] manhim#0000
If I recall, you can only ever have 2 ships being in-use at a time as a free player


[28-Feb-25 03:36 PM] inspirity#0000
ah ok

so like you can own 7 ships but you can only have 2 flying at a time as free or even basic i think


[28-Feb-25 03:42 PM] manhim#0000
Add 2 STO for more storage and you've got a copy-paste of my starter base from a few months ago


[28-Feb-25 03:42 PM] inspirity#0000
bet


[28-Feb-25 03:42 PM] inspirity#0000
ok done


[28-Feb-25 03:44 PM] manhim#0000
What I would suggest, is to start with half that base (5 HB1 and 10 SME) and use the rest of the grant to buy materials. If you do the whole base, then you won't have much money left after for materials. Then you can slowly grow your base until you max your permit.


[28-Feb-25 03:44 PM] manhim#0000
It will also give you a taste of how much logistical work needs to be done to maintain it

then if you have cx stuff set up it will break down the cost


[28-Feb-25 03:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
for all or half?


[28-Feb-25 03:46 PM] inspirity#0000
for half


[28-Feb-25 03:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh and uh someone might sell BBH, BDE, BSE and BTA for cheaper


[28-Feb-25 03:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[28-Feb-25 03:48 PM] inspirity#0000
as in?


[28-Feb-25 03:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so instead of paying 1650/u for BSE you pay 1000/u


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] inspirity#0000
ooh yeah


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] inspirity#0000
nice


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] igfloz#0000
I'd also check CX for ALO cost - @manhim has already offered to supply you - but I think there are a lot of "private deals" in play here. FYI I am currently the largest producer of ALO and I sell very little of it on the CX - and not regularly


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so ~50k in savings on just BSE right there


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] inspirity#0000
wth guys


[28-Feb-25 03:49 PM] inspirity#0000
crazy black market here

[28-Feb-25 03:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i mean it helps when getting started


[28-Feb-25 03:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
we got these kinds of deals when we started


[28-Feb-25 03:50 PM] inspirity#0000
mhm yeah


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] manhim#0000
#internal-offers


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I could help you buy some O and FLX at a cheaper price for a one off thing for O and regularlly for FLX too if you desire


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] manhim#0000
I sell O too


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh there ya go


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] inspirity#0000
thx for all the offers


[28-Feb-25 03:51 PM] inspirity#0000
but first i actually need to have a good plan


[28-Feb-25 03:52 PM] manhim#0000
Yup


[28-Feb-25 03:55 PM] inspirity#0000
would keeping around 200-250k for supplies be enough?


[28-Feb-25 03:56 PM] manhim#0000
Daily cost for half a base with experts level 5 would be around 70k per days


[28-Feb-25 03:56 PM] igfloz#0000
You have to feed your base (supplies for Pioneers etc. and other ingredients) - so it's best to have a suitable wallet "float" so to speak


[28-Feb-25 03:57 PM] igfloz#0000
If you had 1Million AIC, I'd be conservative and suggest keep 50%


[28-Feb-25 03:57 PM] inspirity#0000
idk if u can do anything with this?

time to move them to my base


[01-Mar-25 04:16 PM] inspirity#0000
5h flight 🔥


[01-Mar-25 04:19 PM] igfloz#0000
lucky guy - wait until you expand to further planets, lol (it's not all bad)


[01-Mar-25 04:20 PM] inspirity#0000
i was gonna do that today


[01-Mar-25 04:20 PM] inspirity#0000
but then i chose to work an hour extra and I went outside for 5-6h


[02-Mar-25 05:32 AM] inspirity#0000
i got everything set up


[02-Mar-25 05:32 AM] inspirity#0000
now i just need to order a whole bunch of ALO


[02-Mar-25 05:32 AM] inspirity#0000
and the other stuff


[02-Mar-25 10:14 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You could ask @manhim I think it was?


[02-Mar-25 10:31 AM] inspirity#0000
already ordered like 500


[02-Mar-25 10:31 AM] inspirity#0000
on cx


[02-Mar-25 10:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh nice


[02-Mar-25 11:32 AM] inspirity#0000
i need 3 ships to load it into 🤣


[02-Mar-25 01:55 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, the WCB ship upgrade is very worth it for AL production. But the 2 starter ship should be good for a while.


[02-Mar-25 02:03 PM] inspirity#0000
i have 0 idea what that is


[02-Mar-25 02:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A larger Cargo bay you can upgrade to


[02-Mar-25 02:03 PM] inspirity#0000
ah alright


[02-Mar-25 02:03 PM] inspirity#0000
oh hal whilst ur here


[02-Mar-25 02:03 PM] inspirity#0000
how do i get more permits


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You need to upgrade your HQ level


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] inspirity#0000
alr ill look into that


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You should be able to hit the HQ button on any base overview buffer


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And you can see the details there


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] inspirity#0000
ok plz help i did that i dont see where to upgrade


[02-Mar-25 02:04 PM] inspirity#0000
do i have to fill the sliders?


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] inspirity#0000
ok bet


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] inspirity#0000
can i buy the materials i still need off you?


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So when you have the materials where your HQ you can select the inventory you have them stored in and then move the slider to fill them


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sure


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] inspirity#0000
oki


[02-Mar-25 02:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s just like BSE BBH BDE and BTA


[02-Mar-25 02:06 PM] inspirity#0000
i need TRU too, u sell that?


[02-Mar-25 02:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[02-Mar-25 02:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
200/u


[02-Mar-25 02:06 PM] inspirity#0000
bet ill send the contracts


[02-Mar-25 02:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But technically you shouldn’t need more permits for what you’re doing right now since I don’t think you’re building more bases


[02-Mar-25 02:07 PM] inspirity#0000
just more smelter/housing capacity


[02-Mar-25 02:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And adding two permits onto your current base is likely not the most beneficial thing for you to do rn either


[02-Mar-25 02:07 PM] inspirity#0000
cuz my smelters are filled up all the way and i have like 400 overflow ALO


[02-Mar-25 02:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Do you have 20 SME built?


[02-Mar-25 02:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or still just the 10?


[02-Mar-25 02:08 PM] manhim#0000
It's Ok. Once you have more bases, you're going to need to keep an X days/weeks amount of buffer to optimize logistics.


[02-Mar-25 02:08 PM] inspirity#0000
i think i have 15 rn


[02-Mar-25 02:08 PM] inspirity#0000
14 nvm


[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s ok then I think you’ll be fine


[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] igfloz#0000
open a new buffer and input xit burn_all

[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You should only do 20 SME


[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] igfloz#0000
That will show you how much ALO you use per day


[02-Mar-25 02:09 PM] igfloz#0000
well.. It'll show you how much of everything you use per day

{Reactions}
👆 

[02-Mar-25 02:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can buy some ALO from me or manhim on Deimos if you really need short term

[02-Mar-25 02:10 PM] igfloz#0000
so you have 2 days worth of ALo


[02-Mar-25 02:10 PM] inspirity#0000
i assume the first one is what i consume on a daily basis?


[02-Mar-25 02:10 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[02-Mar-25 02:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The first one is how much you have


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Second is how much you make or use


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] inspirity#0000
ooh yeah ok


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Third is how much you should buy to get to a green buffer


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] igfloz#0000
left to right is current stock / burn per day / how much needed to get you in the green / how many days of burn


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Which you can set to what ever day you need


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You ran out of consumables


[02-Mar-25 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Which means your SME won’t run


[02-Mar-25 02:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like DW RAT etc


[02-Mar-25 02:12 PM] inspirity#0000
ah


[02-Mar-25 02:12 PM] inspirity#0000
ig i need to stock up rq


[02-Mar-25 02:12 PM] inspirity#0000
cuz i have a trip to england in 2d


[02-Mar-25 02:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ye


[02-Mar-25 02:13 PM] igfloz#0000
if you are going to be away from the game for some days..... it's best to stock up and let it run

👆 

[02-Mar-25 02:13 PM] inspirity#0000
can i use the automation command on rPrun in any way for this


[02-Mar-25 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[02-Mar-25 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It can buy the right amount for you for x amount of days


[02-Mar-25 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And even load it into a ship at ANT


[02-Mar-25 02:14 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm not sure that you can automate transport ? - I don't do it, so I can't really inform


[02-Mar-25 02:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can load into ship but then you need to send the ship yourself


[02-Mar-25 02:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How much money do you have?


[02-Mar-25 02:15 PM] inspirity#0000
510k


[02-Mar-25 02:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Will you click the workforce button on your base and screen shot that and send it

[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] igfloz#0000
I have a WCB landing soon at ANT - I need to send stuff to Deimos myself, so I'll throw a load of ALO on it for you - but you need to get stock of OVE / PWO etc. to keep it running


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] igfloz#0000
1 time offer, free ALO, lol


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] inspirity#0000
lol thx


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] inspirity#0000
any knowabouts on when that will arrive?


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] inspirity#0000
actually


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] inspirity#0000
i have a ship at ANT rn so no biggie


[02-Mar-25 02:17 PM] igfloz#0000
It'll be overnight for us. Prob arrive 3am maybe


[02-Mar-25 02:18 PM] inspirity#0000
ok ok


[02-Mar-25 02:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So you could buy 280 DW and RAT then 35 OVE and COF 14 PWO and that would last 10 days


[02-Mar-25 02:18 PM] igfloz#0000
get your ship filled with the burn mats you need - OVE , PWO , DW etc.


[02-Mar-25 02:18 PM] inspirity#0000
sure thing, should i get from cx?


[02-Mar-25 02:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also use the FLX recipe for AL


[02-Mar-25 02:19 PM] inspirity#0000
or get an insider deal


[02-Mar-25 02:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Insider deal would be cheaper but depends on who’s awake to fill


[02-Mar-25 02:19 PM] inspirity#0000
ah i was using the O one


[02-Mar-25 02:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The FLX uses C and O as well just makes one more AL


[02-Mar-25 02:20 PM] inspirity#0000
bet


[02-Mar-25 02:20 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm pretty strapped for OVE right now, but I can send you PWO for 220/u if thats any good ?


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can do COF and DW if you need


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] inspirity#0000
ove is at 130/u on the high end at cx rn ill pass


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] inspirity#0000
mb read it wrong


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] igfloz#0000
lol, I don't have OVE to spare. Just PWO


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
220 for PWO not ove


[02-Mar-25 02:21 PM] inspirity#0000
lemme check PWO


[02-Mar-25 02:22 PM] inspirity#0000
sure illl take that 🤣


[02-Mar-25 02:22 PM] inspirity#0000

[02-Mar-25 02:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Uh I can do COF and DW for 650/u and 75/u if you want


[02-Mar-25 02:24 PM] inspirity#0000

[02-Mar-25 02:26 PM] inspirity#0000
ok then i'd have to buy the RAT and OVE on cx right


[02-Mar-25 02:27 PM] inspirity#0000
btw thx for the deal @igfloz


[02-Mar-25 02:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah unless you want to try to find someone who has an internal offer


[02-Mar-25 02:27 PM] inspirity#0000

[02-Mar-25 02:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[02-Mar-25 02:30 PM] igfloz#0000
ALO takes some space


[02-Mar-25 02:30 PM] laaxus#0000
warehouses are dirt cheap

ah xD


[02-Mar-25 02:30 PM] tanda#0000
I hoard a bit, I have 80 at ANT


[02-Mar-25 02:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000

is it normal to only have the ability to buy 7 warehouses on deimos


[02-Mar-25 02:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[02-Mar-25 02:38 PM] inspirity#0000
ok


[02-Mar-25 02:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Planet WAR are expensive to upgrade for the whole planet


[02-Mar-25 02:38 PM] igfloz#0000
yes, each planet's warehouse capacity is managed by the local govenment


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] inspirity#0000
u have to upgrade it planet wide?


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
7 is actually a lot for a planet per company


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeh


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] inspirity#0000
then ig its logical u only have 7/person xD


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] inspirity#0000
im paying like 2.2k total for warehouses


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] inspirity#0000
i forgot if it was /day or /week


[02-Mar-25 02:39 PM] igfloz#0000
FYI - I only have 2 STO and 6 Warehouse on Deimos


[02-Mar-25 02:40 PM] igfloz#0000

[02-Mar-25 02:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
At least


[02-Mar-25 02:57 PM] inspirity#0000
yeah thats not a concern


[02-Mar-25 02:57 PM] igfloz#0000
In the future, I can possibly help you with O - not sure how much excess I will have at Deimos, unless maybe you are already collecting O ?


[02-Mar-25 02:57 PM] inspirity#0000
just the insane amount of ALO


[02-Mar-25 02:58 PM] inspirity#0000
nope i have 0 idea how that works, my friend told me something something atmosphere but 0 idea what that meant


[02-Mar-25 02:59 PM] igfloz#0000
so.. you need O (Oxygen) to smelt AL right ?


[02-Mar-25 03:01 PM] inspirity#0000
yeah


[02-Mar-25 03:02 PM] igfloz#0000
well, Deimos is Kinda OK to collect O if you wish. You might have to make space to build collectors (lose some SME) - or you buy O from someone


[02-Mar-25 04:49 PM] potaterror#0000
If someone's feeling enterprising you could go in with a few other players and have an O/ALO base and a couple dedicated SME bases, then split the take.


[02-Mar-25 04:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A quasi DNCP


[02-Mar-25 07:26 PM] potaterror#0000
Exactly.


[03-Mar-25 12:05 AM] .urpalhal#0000
@lax9552 you can present your plan for a grant in here like Tanda said check #agp-information for more information about the program


[03-Mar-25 02:34 AM] inspirity#0000

[03-Mar-25 06:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I could ship like 1000 units for you over to Deimos, if you need assistance


[03-Mar-25 06:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I fly that route regularly and have some WCB (big ships) available


[03-Mar-25 06:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, if you have struggle to ship the AL back to ANT, sell it on the LM or directly to me or @evov on Deimos - I will ship it myself and EvoV is always in need for AL 😂


[03-Mar-25 06:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Damn, where are you getting all that ALO from?


[03-Mar-25 06:14 AM] inspirity#0000
would be nice, otherwise i wont have it all at my base before im gone for a week


[03-Mar-25 06:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sure - send me a transport contract for 3000t max - should be 1000 ALO iirc with a few days for completion


[03-Mar-25 06:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
3000 aic is enough to cover the costs 😉


[03-Mar-25 06:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You can also always post LM ads on ANT to transport stuff over to Deimos. In my experience they get picked up rather quickly, since there is a lot of traffic between Deimos and ANT


[03-Mar-25 07:30 AM] inspirity#0000
alr bet


[03-Mar-25 07:30 AM] inspirity#0000
i have 0 idea what LM ads are please enlighten me


[03-Mar-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
it's like a cx


[03-Mar-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
but wish version


[03-Mar-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
+ with shipping contract


[03-Mar-25 07:31 AM] inspirity#0000
lol alr bet


[03-Mar-25 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000
in short, they're contract


[03-Mar-25 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000
that are public


[03-Mar-25 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000
and that anybody can accept


[03-Mar-25 07:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
^ basically that


[03-Mar-25 07:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You can access them via the `LM` command


[03-Mar-25 07:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
For the ANT LM, usw. `LM ANT`


[03-Mar-25 07:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
everybody can post and accept offers there. They work mostly like normal contracts, when accepted.


[03-Mar-25 07:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You have to pay a little fee to post and ad, tho


[03-Mar-25 07:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Deimos has one, too: `LM ZV-759c`


[03-Mar-25 07:36 AM] laaxus#0000
fee so small you can safely ignore it


[03-Mar-25 07:36 AM] laaxus#0000
it's a rounding error tbh


[03-Mar-25 07:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
They are mostly used for local trading


[03-Mar-25 07:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I personally like them and include them on every base screen. But some don’t ever look at them.


[03-Mar-25 07:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, they work great on the CX and very active planets like Deimos, but are mostly dead on smaller ones


[03-Mar-25 07:56 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I do wish the CX LMs had a way to filter (or, a better sort) by shipping destination (or source -- whichever end isn't the CX)

I mine a lot. I used to be the top producer of ALO, but I'll be dropping down the ranks now that I'm changing my focus a little


[03-Mar-25 12:42 PM] nx#0000
Hi! I'm about 2 and a half weeks into the game, and I was hoping to get the grant to help speed some things along. Currently, I have a base on Phobos working on making FE, which at the moment, is my primary source of income. I also have a base on Norwick, but that is with the Aluminium Alliance. My plans with the grant are to expand to Harmonia to produce some C and RAT to help bring expenses down and allow me to move into production of STL back on Phobos. I would like to eventually move into some kind of manufacturing, but that knowledge is currently beyond me at the moment. The PrUnPlanner for my planned expansion is: https://prunplanner.org/shared/ee9b28d0-8f10-4c53-ab6f-9322ab9d36a7. Please let me know if I’m super off with what I’m trying to do.

[03-Mar-25 01:13 PM] potaterror#0000
Bit busy, if you're wanting to go into C production you'd be better served going for some resource extraction planet. Nascent might be of interest, you could just sell ALO instead of producing O. Also, Phobos isn't going to be great for STL prodution long term, I think, it's cross-COGC as well.


[03-Mar-25 01:18 PM] potaterror#0000
If you wanted to get mildly silly with things you could set up some bases over in SE-110a and do quite a bit of that in-system.


[03-Mar-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Phobos FE isn't particularly great


[03-Mar-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000

As a suggestion (and I'm sure JC will offer more on this) - get set up on deliveries / week or something solid. I'm sure no one want to mess around with 50 or 26 Al each time

I am looking for a grant to complete my refineries on deimos. I have a trading partner for my current 12 (10k ff/d). But would like to round it out and max the area. I also produce AL and fill small value gaps at AI1 through 2 bmp and various SML.


[03-Mar-25 10:02 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm sorry, did you say you make FF on deimos? 👀


[03-Mar-25 10:05 PM] lax9552#0000
Yep, ~50% H integrated from Romulus. Not the best ROI but I am a big risk management guy.


[03-Mar-25 10:07 PM] jcheung#0000
what's the profit/d roughly of your completed base?


[03-Mar-25 10:07 PM] lax9552#0000
I can fit 4-6 ref and could scale down on ext and sme if demand is high enough. All my FF is currently contd to my angel investor but always happy to mix it up.


[03-Mar-25 10:07 PM] jcheung#0000
are you familiar with COGC?


[03-Mar-25 10:07 PM] lax9552#0000
Both together 150 profit

huh. is FF really that profitable nowadays?


[03-Mar-25 10:10 PM] jcheung#0000
holy shit, FF is more profitable than metallurgy on deimos >.<


[03-Mar-25 10:10 PM] lax9552#0000
Partner picks up plt side transport low, with h integration helps steady price. More also comes from quick production batches


[03-Mar-25 10:10 PM] jcheung#0000
well, specifically more profitable than AL

[04-Mar-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
On that topic


[04-Mar-25 10:24 AM] laaxus#0000
Small confession


[04-Mar-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
The New fuel requires a New kind of  resource


[04-Mar-25 10:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yep


[04-Mar-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
That'll probably be on an unsettled planet


[04-Mar-25 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I almost joined a plan to put ships all around the galaxy, to be the first to Settle on such planets, put the Settlement tax to 10M and earn a lot of money through that monopoloy


[04-Mar-25 10:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[04-Mar-25 10:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Maybe


[04-Mar-25 10:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I can give you a grant


[04-Mar-25 10:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It’s actively worked on, so it will be released eventually


[04-Mar-25 10:45 AM] thinkrhino#0000
@laaxus your face when the new fuel type is farmed from asteroids.


[04-Mar-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
asteroids will come one year after the release of gateways at best


[04-Mar-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm safe


[04-Mar-25 10:51 AM] thinkrhino#0000

Hi everyone


[05-Mar-25 05:25 AM] keremcozin#0000
I'm a returning player with a fresh start with COLIQ. My previous company was called Ad Astra Corporation and later I formed Per Aspera Innovations if you remember the names. Anyway they are in the history of PrUn now. I restarted at Hortus - Promitor a couple of weeks ago.


[05-Mar-25 05:27 AM] keremcozin#0000
I just happened to know about this ADI program recently and I wish to offer you my plan to get benefit from it; I wish to establish my second base at Harmonia as a Carbon Farmer, a full (1-permit) base dedicated to Carbon Farming there and therefore further possible expansion into Construction and/or Plastics


[05-Mar-25 05:28 AM] keremcozin#0000
I can provide you my plan made at PrUnplanner website


[05-Mar-25 05:30 AM] laaxus#0000

[05-Mar-25 05:36 AM] keremcozin#0000
65 C and 62 H2O daily production, while still slightly relying on market


[05-Mar-25 05:37 AM] keremcozin#0000
What I learned in all the time I played is, being totally self-sufficient is harmful to the game economy 🙂


[05-Mar-25 05:38 AM] keremcozin#0000
So I'm planning to always leave some room to imports this time


[05-Mar-25 05:39 AM] keremcozin#0000
haha Laaxus our avatars are so similar alike 😄 😹


[05-Mar-25 05:47 AM] keremcozin#0000

[05-Mar-25 05:59 AM] laaxus#0000
I can't give you the grant myself, my finance are currently thight because of a project of mine


[05-Mar-25 06:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
watch out for those missing PIO's tho, personally I don't like that little inefficiency, but if it works for you it should be fine


[05-Mar-25 06:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
although you are missing out on about 4.5 carbon per day because of it..


[05-Mar-25 06:11 AM] tanda#0000
I can't see profit numbers currently, but I suspect that it's probably still better to import water to Harmonia rather than pump on site


[05-Mar-25 06:11 AM] tanda#0000
and buying water on the LM for Harmonia is usually pretty easy


[05-Mar-25 06:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
probably true aswell


[05-Mar-25 06:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah the base becomes 100k cheaper and has 2k more profit if you change out all the RIG's for FRM's and remove 1 INC to make space


[05-Mar-25 06:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
only lose out on ~2.5 carbon per day but produce a bunch of HCP and GRN


[05-Mar-25 06:35 AM] keremcozin#0000
hmm..from my previous experience, on that paper those imports look good but as a new player with limited logistics support, I have to keep transporting goods between planet and the market constantly which can be tiresome especially at the start

here no storage unfortunately but more Carbon and more surplus agri stuff


[05-Mar-25 06:46 AM] keremcozin#0000
if I stock some H2O upstart that won't be an issue probably, I'm planning to have a water base at Boucher next, or maybe Etherwind


[05-Mar-25 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend at least one sto


[05-Mar-25 06:48 AM] keremcozin#0000
I like having STO too


[05-Mar-25 06:48 AM] keremcozin#0000
I'll look more about the other industry possibilities


[05-Mar-25 06:49 AM] keremcozin#0000

last one can work very well


[05-Mar-25 08:30 AM] keremcozin#0000
if you think I would be eligible, I'll work towards establishing a base there as soon as possible


[05-Mar-25 08:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
that base looks better, adjust the ratios on the farms though so that you only produce exactly enough GRN to supply your INC, that way you maximise your HER output since that is much more valuable.


[05-Mar-25 09:52 AM] finestone#0000
I would probably go 2 STO 2 Rig drop 1 FRM I can send you a grant assuming you have PRO


[05-Mar-25 09:53 AM] finestone#0000
I usually run 2-3 STO on all planets


[05-Mar-25 10:29 AM] keremcozin#0000
wow that would be amazing for me, my ships are already around  Antares. Yes I have PRO. I can establish the base after tomorrow


[05-Mar-25 10:29 AM] keremcozin#0000
I would probably go 2 STO 2 Rig drop 1 FRM >> can do that


[05-Mar-25 10:32 AM] finestone#0000
you could also drop the Rigs and go 11 FRM 3 INC w/ 3 STO since farms seems to have good margins atm.


[05-Mar-25 10:33 AM] keremcozin#0000
I can do that, since the main profit is coming from HER


[05-Mar-25 10:33 AM] finestone#0000
are you planning on leaving one ship in HORTUS and 1 Ship in ANT then?


[05-Mar-25 10:33 AM] keremcozin#0000
Yes


[05-Mar-25 10:34 AM] keremcozin#0000
Right now both of my ships at ANT because they are doing delivery jobs


[05-Mar-25 10:34 AM] finestone#0000
yeah water is cheap and pretty consistent so your fine just buying.

There's like 2 sub-bullet points there, imo


[05-Mar-25 05:32 PM] tanda#0000
1.a: The product you're producing is not going to saturate your market by outstripping demand
1.b: You can feasibly ship the inputs and outputs for your base


[05-Mar-25 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Yeah probably


[06-Mar-25 12:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Also you don’t need an order for each building you can just put one HER and one H2O and it will cover all the buildings


[06-Mar-25 12:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
If you wanted to do HER and say GRN then you would add another order to do that

[06-Mar-25 10:10 AM] evany.#0000 (pinned)
not to dissuade you and it can get all-encompassing a bit i'd put a few caveats as a new player

- Probably avoid anything that requires engineers/scientists workers
- at least 70% of the base(buildings) follow the planets COGC
- Don't overwhelm yourself for shipping, you might only have one base now and you have two ships so you feel like you have the world at your fingertips, you will feel differently when you drop your 5th or 7th base and still only have two ships
- don't try to verticalize your bases ("oh i need O so i better extract O so its free") while this might be true it is important to 'realize' your profits so you can do things / follow other interests
- its okay to have a grandiose plan like "oh i want to make FIM" and build up the ration base then the DDT base then the HER base then the FIM base, but especially early on focus on one part of that chain as all parts of the chain are profitable and move in volume its OK to pick and choose where you want to start, but if you say "evan im gonna make drones" thats going to require like 5 bases and there is no market for them / they don't sell especially the intermediate parts.
- check around #trading when standing up those bases to see if people have spare fabs they will part with for you, makes it cheaper for when you drop the base maybe you can make 9 buildings instead of 7


[06-Mar-25 10:11 AM] pagy1234#0000

[06-Mar-25 10:13 AM] evany.#0000
it occurs to me that i got a lot of this sort of advice when i started, but either I never asked why or the rationale behind it was never offered. certainly could be a mix of both.

{Reactions}
👆 

[06-Mar-25 10:14 AM] evany.#0000
this is definitely viable and i used the FIM example as just that - an example.

But you have this on planet Phobos which is a electronics planet, do not build FRM on an electronics planet, if you want to run FRM then COLIQ into harmonia is your better bet - then take the grant


[06-Mar-25 10:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
My unpopular opinion is some small violations of "the rules" early on are ok, especailly if the alternative is sending a lot of nearly empty ship trips (which, early on, can be a significant fraction of your income)

But being aware of these sorts of things and the choices you are making, and watching for when you need to change is key.


[06-Mar-25 10:19 AM] evany.#0000
I will also add to what hal said,  you only need a single recurring order
the reason you can put in multiple options with recurring orders is so you can balance whats being made and how much of it. e.g with actual electronics bases

[06-Mar-25 10:24 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Hey looking to re lay out my base on Phobos: 

300k - 252,048.80 + starting materials

2 x HB2 
2 x EDM

Producing SCN with an ROI of 12.37 days and high trade volume making it a profitable choice to maneuver into


[06-Mar-25 10:24 AM] evany.#0000
SCN is a great choice as it's a pop consumable and thus there will always be demand


[06-Mar-25 10:24 AM] jab.sh#0000
well when you sell it for $1500 😂


[06-Mar-25 10:24 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Yes it’s highly profitable also electronics is my specialty


[06-Mar-25 10:25 AM] evany.#0000
we are antares, we are all electronics specialty


[06-Mar-25 10:25 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Giving me a starting daily profit around $30,542.54


[06-Mar-25 10:25 AM] infinit3kr#0000
20**


[06-Mar-25 10:26 AM] infinit3kr#0000
On which I can keep expanding and a great rate from there


[06-Mar-25 10:26 AM] laaxus#0000
The grant is about 1M tho


[06-Mar-25 10:26 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Focus on one thing now to start and get rid of my 3 BMP that are making peanuts


[06-Mar-25 10:26 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Then I can double or triple that


[06-Mar-25 10:27 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Triple would be around 750k


[06-Mar-25 10:27 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Plus materials


[06-Mar-25 10:27 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Then I’d be making over 60k daily profit to start and still 12-13d ROI


[06-Mar-25 10:28 AM] infinit3kr#0000
And have liquid for materials fuel and both luxury items which increase profits


[06-Mar-25 10:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
make sure to keep ALOT of cash on hand


[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] infinit3kr#0000
That would leave me with about 250k liquid


[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Just short of that


[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
when I started out i kept about 400k as cash from the grant, in under a week it was gone


[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
theres so many miniscule costs that add up fast


[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] laaxus#0000

[06-Mar-25 10:29 AM] infinit3kr#0000

as long as you sell into bids, no issue


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000
but as soon as you want to start selling at ask


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I have that profit calculated for bids


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] infinit3kr#0000
So anytning more is better


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] laaxus#0000
capital will be hold into the market


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
fuel costs is a suprisingly large one if you ship alot, maybe not in your case though, another is any small adjustments you make, "ohh maybe a STO would have been great to add", bam 40k gone


[06-Mar-25 10:30 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I’d start with bids until I built enough of a cushion


[06-Mar-25 10:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
building up a buffer of consumables is insanely expasive aswell


[06-Mar-25 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
you should sell into bids until you're feeling confident in your situation to sell at ask


[06-Mar-25 10:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
if you want 10 day coverage be ready to spend 50k straight up


[06-Mar-25 10:32 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Yes I think 250k buffer would be more than enough for me to get everything off the ground profiting


[06-Mar-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, I recommend 5-10 days of consummables
(I do 45)

Yes I get a buffer of consumables  and plan trips and fuel accordingly


[06-Mar-25 10:33 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I’ve been profitable with the little I have

[06-Mar-25 10:34 AM] evany.#0000
older players will do better at keeping stocks just due to nature of having access to more capital, i remember struggling to keep 72hours worth of consumables on hand as i was probably "two months old" by time i got grant

Refined PrUn - QoL extension for Prosperous Universe
Prosperous Universe is a great game, but some missing features and minor annoyances can disrupt the experience. So here be dragons.  Refined PrUn started as a fork of PMMG Extended and ended up being an almost complete rewrite of the base extension. The result is better performance and UI responsiveness, as well as new features and QoL improveme...

I highly calculate anytning before I do it


[06-Mar-25 10:34 AM] infinit3kr#0000
As you seen my spreadsheets also lol

my friend said AGP is just propaganda 🤣🙏


[06-Mar-25 10:44 AM] laaxus#0000
the ADI is a reverse pyramid scheme


[06-Mar-25 10:49 AM] infinit3kr#0000
so $762,146,40 would get 6 HB2 and 6EDM up and running with a $61,582.63 daily profit based on bid price


[06-Mar-25 10:50 AM] infinit3kr#0000
wait i would only need 3 HB@ so $706,141.20


[06-Mar-25 10:50 AM] infinit3kr#0000
leaving just short of 300k liquid


[06-Mar-25 10:51 AM] infinit3kr#0000
11.47 day ROI


[06-Mar-25 10:53 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I would totally remove my current BMPs I may keep my HB1s and just add in some extractors for SIO


[06-Mar-25 10:53 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, BMP on phobos is not ... great


[06-Mar-25 10:53 AM] infinit3kr#0000
yeah it sucks but it got me started


[06-Mar-25 10:53 AM] infinit3kr#0000
and was able to get it profitable


[06-Mar-25 10:54 AM] infinit3kr#0000
good practice now time to change and grow


[06-Mar-25 11:01 AM] infinit3kr#0000
So after much consideration that will be my plan to move forward with.


[06-Mar-25 11:28 AM] evany.#0000
are you looking for a grant?


[06-Mar-25 11:33 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Yes I am

How would I proceed?

has the plan already been reviewed?


[06-Mar-25 12:18 PM] laaxus#0000
I did not checked the plan personnaly


[06-Mar-25 12:19 PM] infinit3kr#0000
Do you want me to lay out the plan to you?


[06-Mar-25 12:19 PM] laaxus#0000
I have like 50M into project corgi


[06-Mar-25 12:20 PM] realharvey#0000
I am to busy for analysis currently. But I wanted to ping someone that might have more cash flush


[06-Mar-25 12:20 PM] laaxus#0000
Maybe 40, have to check


[06-Mar-25 12:20 PM] realharvey#0000
my Money is all down in the HCB project


[06-Mar-25 12:20 PM] realharvey#0000
still not back to solid cashflow


[06-Mar-25 12:22 PM] infinit3kr#0000
1M would get me 6 profitable EDMs running with a $61,582.63 Daily profit and 11.47 day ROI prodicing SCN and this profit is based on bid price.

[06-Mar-25 12:23 PM] infinit3kr#0000
market data is also changing  trends off a support line which shows a good indication also


[06-Mar-25 12:24 PM] infinit3kr#0000
It is a solid opportunity which would get me profitable and in a position to grow and expand


[06-Mar-25 12:25 PM] infinit3kr#0000
With the amount I would be producing also would not be enough at this point to over saturate the market and cause a decline in bid prices


[06-Mar-25 12:26 PM] infinit3kr#0000
Setup cost would be $706,141.20 leaving just under 300k liquid for a consumable buffer, fuel costs, and anything unexpected.


[06-Mar-25 12:38 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure you've highlighted some short term spikes after someone buys a bunch of upkeep at once, but the long term trend to me appears to be going down


[06-Mar-25 12:39 PM] infinit3kr#0000
look at the bear candles they have all broken upwards everything has tested to the support line and even the recent bear candles have not broken it


[06-Mar-25 12:40 PM] infinit3kr#0000
there was one test to break the support back a ways but it was not able ot


[06-Mar-25 12:40 PM] infinit3kr#0000
and even at this low bid price it is still highly profitable


[06-Mar-25 12:40 PM] infinit3kr#0000
which leaves a lot of room for flexability in price


[06-Mar-25 12:42 PM] infinit3kr#0000
it looks to be a pretty safe endeavor for me to pursue


[06-Mar-25 12:44 PM] jcheung#0000
This at 2k/u?
What does it change to if you're down to 1.8k/u? Just out of curiousity


[06-Mar-25 12:46 PM] infinit3kr#0000
still 49,581 proft daily


[06-Mar-25 12:46 PM] infinit3kr#0000
copmpared to 61


[06-Mar-25 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Hmmm. SCN might be a good export to HRT


[06-Mar-25 12:46 PM] infinit3kr#0000
and this is the bottom of bid prices .. any more is over and above this


[06-Mar-25 12:47 PM] infinit3kr#0000
i have been playing it safe


[06-Mar-25 12:47 PM] jcheung#0000
You mean top of bid?


[06-Mar-25 12:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Bottom of bid is 333/u


[06-Mar-25 12:47 PM] infinit3kr#0000
top but lower than any ask prices


[06-Mar-25 12:47 PM] infinit3kr#0000
and higher prices at other CX


[06-Mar-25 12:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Till what price point do you see your base being profitable?


[06-Mar-25 12:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also I’m a scientist so I know shit about candles and economics


[06-Mar-25 12:51 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm pretty sure their "support line" is just gaia exporting to other markets actually 🤔


[06-Mar-25 12:52 PM] infinit3kr#0000
around 1000 per unit


[06-Mar-25 12:52 PM] infinit3kr#0000
still profitable just over $1300 a day


[06-Mar-25 12:52 PM] infinit3kr#0000
so that would be where it would pretty muxh 0 out


[06-Mar-25 12:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well Gaia supplies all the EDC IDC bases on Malahat


[06-Mar-25 12:53 PM] infinit3kr#0000
and by the time that .. if it ever .. hit i would have enough of a buffer to be able to reconfigure a base into something profitable again


[06-Mar-25 12:54 PM] jcheung#0000
You should think about reconfiguring below 20k/d profit

{Reactions}
👆 

[06-Mar-25 12:54 PM] jcheung#0000
Even that is low


[06-Mar-25 12:55 PM] infinit3kr#0000
Right now starting out I have been able to run some BMPs ... making peanuts but with the small amount I have had and the short time in doing so I have been able to profit and buffer around 100k plus a consumable buffer


[06-Mar-25 12:56 PM] jcheung#0000
What's the rest of the base gonna be


[06-Mar-25 12:56 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I was planning SIO extractors


[06-Mar-25 12:56 PM] infinit3kr#0000
safe and profitable


[06-Mar-25 12:56 PM] jcheung#0000
What planet?


[06-Mar-25 12:57 PM] infinit3kr#0000
Phobos


[06-Mar-25 12:57 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I could do farming with fertility but with running electronics i decided SIO as it can generate profit while focusing on the electornics side


[06-Mar-25 12:58 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I  could run 6 extractos with the habitats i have now


[06-Mar-25 12:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so you are going to run just 2 EDM with some EXT?


[06-Mar-25 12:59 PM] infinit3kr#0000
6 EDM


[06-Mar-25 01:00 PM] infinit3kr#0000
3 HB2


[06-Mar-25 01:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
making about 55 or so SCN a day?


[06-Mar-25 01:00 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I currently have 3 HB1 and could run dorry 5 EXT off it not 6


[06-Mar-25 01:00 PM] infinit3kr#0000
60 a day


[06-Mar-25 01:00 PM] infinit3kr#0000
SCN


[06-Mar-25 01:01 PM] infinit3kr#0000
120K profit - 58,416.87 expenses


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] infinit3kr#0000
resulting in 61,582.63 /d


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] realharvey#0000
120k profit is the wrong terminology. its 120K Revenue 58k expenses and 61k profit


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] jcheung#0000
Is this including SIO or not


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] infinit3kr#0000
revenue


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] infinit3kr#0000
no


[06-Mar-25 01:02 PM] infinit3kr#0000
this is purely the SCN


[06-Mar-25 01:03 PM] infinit3kr#0000
this provides 11-12 day ROI on construction costs the SIO would then be as follows


[06-Mar-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
If you had a full 500 area base, what'd be your profit ?

{Reactions}
👆 

[06-Mar-25 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
We usually talk about profit per permit, or roi


[06-Mar-25 01:04 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I was basing off of what i could do with 1m


[06-Mar-25 01:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so 60 a day would put you at second for production of SCN in the universe


[06-Mar-25 01:04 PM] realharvey#0000
Bases are evalued at their ROI/Profit when fully build


[06-Mar-25 01:05 PM] realharvey#0000
If you plan a base that would be over 1 mil, thats no issue. You start with a smaller percentage of the base and build it up with the profits


[06-Mar-25 01:05 PM] jcheung#0000
Looking at it a bit more, they're right, it'll take a while for SCN to dip low enough to not make it worthwhile, unless someone else drops out early and keeps it up


[06-Mar-25 01:06 PM] laaxus#0000
Can you easily produce something else if the scn Price becomes too low ?


[06-Mar-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
At least until CU prices go to the moon again


[06-Mar-25 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
In edms? Not particularly


[06-Mar-25 01:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
With what I can see with 6 HB2 12 EDM 1 STO ~317k rev 188k profit 3.78 day ROI


[06-Mar-25 01:07 PM] jcheung#0000
What about 6 edm 5 ext on sio


[06-Mar-25 01:07 PM] laaxus#0000
Btw, if you overproduce, you Can easily export with yulli https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1209891299528802325


[06-Mar-25 01:07 PM] infinit3kr#0000
8 EDM / 5 EXT would fill my base


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] infinit3kr#0000
bringing me to 468 area used


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, the point of the AGP is forcing you to make the best base


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
But to make you avoid Bad one


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] infinit3kr#0000
yes its great


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] infinit3kr#0000
ive had to thank a lot i actually appreciate it


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] infinit3kr#0000
think


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] jcheung#0000
Not particularly


[06-Mar-25 01:08 PM] infinit3kr#0000
so thank you


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
I think your base is good enough, tho the one you must convince is the one with the money


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] infinit3kr#0000
thats always what it comes down to xD


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] jcheung#0000
They've demonstrated the ability to make a base, and defended their reasoning. The next part is finding someone with funds to support that base


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
You'll either make a ton of profit or learn a lot, win win


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] jcheung#0000
There really is no "best" base

{Reactions}
👆 

[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] infinit3kr#0000
I will make profit regardless


[06-Mar-25 01:09 PM] infinit3kr#0000
i will make sure of it


[06-Mar-25 01:10 PM] infinit3kr#0000
im determined and i dont make decisions lightly


[06-Mar-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
I would argue among the best base is high roi low shipping Aka FRM on harmonia is the best for a beginner


[06-Mar-25 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so i just put in 8 EDM 5 EXT 2 STO shows 109k profit 5.33 d ROI this is with no experts


[06-Mar-25 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Did you know that if every single beginner started FRMs on harmonia, that would rapidly not become the "best"?


[06-Mar-25 01:11 PM] realharvey#0000
or SME on Deimos, or BMP on Heph :D


[06-Mar-25 01:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean I have the cash to do it if I wanted to

Even if her Price goes down, they Can make rat

FRM on harmonia will Never ever be bad


[06-Mar-25 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000
And right now, it's OP lol


[06-Mar-25 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Then when it comes flooding in, you have a bunch of newbies stuck with FRMs and HER will be 10/u


[06-Mar-25 01:13 PM] laaxus#0000
Again, they Can just produce rat


[06-Mar-25 01:13 PM] laaxus#0000
And rat will sell


[06-Mar-25 01:14 PM] realharvey#0000
even DW is still super profitable, and its been a while

Make sure you keep enough money in reserve for feedstock and "oops i screwed up"


[06-Mar-25 01:25 PM] infinit3kr#0000
yeah ill have just under 400k liquid


[06-Mar-25 01:25 PM] infinit3kr#0000
i have about 100k from my personal funds i have made so far


[06-Mar-25 01:25 PM] infinit3kr#0000
building costs around 706k


[06-Mar-25 01:25 PM] infinit3kr#0000
leaving me with just shy of 400k liquid


[06-Mar-25 01:26 PM] infinit3kr#0000

Cool. What does 10 days worth of CU and PE set you back?

also I could keep 1 or 2 of my material plants i have running that are making PE right now

since they are already set up and runniong


[06-Mar-25 01:27 PM] infinit3kr#0000
running


[06-Mar-25 01:28 PM] infinit3kr#0000
would have to  see if the savings there is more profitable than an EXT


[06-Mar-25 01:28 PM] jcheung#0000
What do they make now?


[06-Mar-25 01:28 PM] infinit3kr#0000
Im currently running 3 BMP making PE


[06-Mar-25 01:29 PM] infinit3kr#0000
they make

Oh. Well, yeah you should use that then lmao


[06-Mar-25 01:29 PM] infinit3kr#0000
but here is the thing ...


[06-Mar-25 01:29 PM] infinit3kr#0000
they only save about $1 per unit


[06-Mar-25 01:29 PM] infinit3kr#0000
which is less than i would be making replacing it with an EXT


[06-Mar-25 01:30 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh. You have BMPs kn site? Yeah. Replace 'em

360k would give 10 days buffer of consumables


[06-Mar-25 01:36 PM] infinit3kr#0000
which i think i will start with 2 runs and gradually add more on each time until my buffer is built up so i dont drop all my liquid right off the get go

I'd like to use the money to upgrade my production in ANT.

phew that's a lot of shipping 😄


[10-Mar-25 10:31 PM] jab.sh#0000
maybe I should turn some of my excess lst into mcg, especially since it's at mm


[10-Mar-25 10:32 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Yes it will be. I got a loan and I have some WCBs. I'd have to check it daily.


[10-Mar-25 10:36 PM] jcheung#0000
mcg has been pegged for a while


[10-Mar-25 10:36 PM] jcheung#0000
i've been holding the bottom at 33/u for a while now


[10-Mar-25 10:38 PM] jcheung#0000
roughly speaking this is where i've been trying to bump the bottom line, i think

[10-Mar-25 10:41 PM] runawayfighter#0000
bump it down. This isnt a business to earn money in I understand but its honest work. theres a lot of demand so id make money I think. From what I see there is more volume than produced. I dont know if I'd agree to keeping the price there. Hmm


[10-Mar-25 10:47 PM] jcheung#0000
bump it down? sure, if you can list enough asks to do so, then certainly


[10-Mar-25 10:49 PM] runawayfighter#0000
I'm not there yet but thats a nice goal to have for production.


[10-Mar-25 10:49 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Your trying to keep it above 33?


[10-Mar-25 10:51 PM] jcheung#0000
trying to rais the bottom for any newbies that don't have money to sell into. if the top comes down, that would also serve my purposes


[10-Mar-25 10:57 PM] runawayfighter#0000
yeah the candles show someones messing with it. What are they doing? Selling large amounts at 33? is that you


[10-Mar-25 10:58 PM] jcheung#0000
no, i'm buying


[10-Mar-25 10:58 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Oh. People are listing that low? Hmm... I'd think most people would list higher. Because I think they'd sell at 35.90. I check the price daily and its usually not very much volume available.


[10-Mar-25 11:02 PM] jcheung#0000
people were selling at 27 with people buying from the MM


[10-Mar-25 11:03 PM] runawayfighter#0000
So they buy it and then sell it at 27 for the new players?


[10-Mar-25 11:03 PM] jcheung#0000
no


[10-Mar-25 11:03 PM] jcheung#0000
i think you're confused
nobody is buying high and selling low


[10-Mar-25 11:10 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Oh that just seems like a huge mistake for MCG producers.


[10-Mar-25 11:10 PM] runawayfighter#0000
You said the commodity was pegged, so I assume it was some sort of charity.


[10-Mar-25 11:11 PM] runawayfighter#0000
The volume from this seems to be too much for anyone to sell anywhere lower than MM. Or maybe 35.


[10-Mar-25 11:14 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Looking at volume and seeing the offers daily. I see no one offering significant portions of MCG to satisfy t he demand. I assume most of the buys are being supplied by MM as you said.


[10-Mar-25 11:14 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, it's pegged to the MM


[10-Mar-25 11:14 PM] jcheung#0000
but sellers that need cash fast are stuck selling low


[10-Mar-25 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
which is like all the new players


[10-Mar-25 11:15 PM] runawayfighter#0000
I'd say they're just making a mistake* with their decision making. It will sell. Look at the volume being sold.


[10-Mar-25 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
a lot of people simply don't have the time


[10-Mar-25 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
when you need to load and turn within 30 minutes or you miss production ticks, you dump now and go


[10-Mar-25 11:16 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Well a grant would definitely give me the time. I'm hoping to increase production.


[10-Mar-25 11:17 PM] runawayfighter#0000
I started the base acouple days ago with a loan from lowstrife.


[10-Mar-25 11:17 PM] runawayfighter#0000
But I didn't get enough for the full base.


[10-Mar-25 11:18 PM] runawayfighter#0000
is there anything you dont like about the plan?


[10-Mar-25 11:20 PM] jcheung#0000
i'd like to suggest you make a little EXO as well


[10-Mar-25 11:22 PM] jcheung#0000
it'll reduce your shipping load some, and get you higher profits


[10-Mar-25 11:33 PM] runawayfighter#0000
That's a good idea.


[10-Mar-25 11:33 PM] runawayfighter#0000
its not MCG though 😦


[10-Mar-25 11:35 PM] runawayfighter#0000
I am supplying my own LST. So I dont know how that affects the equation that prunplanner has. Or what button to hit


[10-Mar-25 11:35 PM] jcheung#0000
no, but it gives you better margins-you don't have to do a lot of it


[10-Mar-25 11:42 PM] runawayfighter#0000
But I didn't spend any money already setting up a base to make the consumables of EXO. I kinda already made an LST base. whoop.


[10-Mar-25 11:43 PM] runawayfighter#0000
Maybe I could try making my own OVE. Let me put that into the tool

Hey, I'm interested in expanding my operations in ANT, with a particular focus on luxury consumables. Currently, I have three bases: Harmonia (RAT and DW), Boucher (H2O), and JS-869c (DDT materials).
I would appreciate any suggestions regarding further expansion opportunities, especially those that could be supported by the grant program.

[12-Mar-25 03:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
SE-110 system is perfect for COF (very expensive tho)


[12-Mar-25 03:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
SE-110c = H2O , SE-110b = Agri, and SE-110a = FP


[12-Mar-25 03:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
Although it is far more profitable to ignore the agri planet and just do dw


[12-Mar-25 03:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
KOM could work there I guess?


[12-Mar-25 11:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000

Lemuria is fiiiiiine.


[13-Mar-25 01:30 PM] potaterror#0000
If you want a naturally fertile planet in HRT space, options are limited. Also there's a perfectly good FP planet right next door!


[13-Mar-25 01:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The minus just means it’s like 86% fertile


[13-Mar-25 01:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Which affects your efficiency


[13-Mar-25 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Demeter and Harmonia for FRMs / ORCs, Thalassa for HYFs 😉


[13-Mar-25 01:36 PM] potaterror#0000
The governor of Lemuria is top notch though, he's listened to every request I've made.


[13-Mar-25 01:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
We’re not bashing Lemuria it’s just not the best fit for FRM and ORC


[13-Mar-25 01:36 PM] potaterror#0000
Great place to move if you wanna be near Boucher's water. A++, would recommend.


[13-Mar-25 01:36 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, that's fair, I wouldn't put an ORC farm there.


[13-Mar-25 01:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also technically not in Antares space so people might not love sponsoring a grant for a plan there


[13-Mar-25 01:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So just things to consider and think of when making a plan


[13-Mar-25 01:37 PM] potaterror#0000
Fair. It'd have some awkward shipping overhead for a new player, it's a day out from HRT/Boucher, so a solid 2+ from ANT.


[13-Mar-25 01:41 PM] potaterror#0000
If you do end up developing plans down in that area Jerry, I may be down to assist with financing. It's not ANT space, but southern HRT is kind of my jam.

would the COGC boost offset that ?

Depends on what you mean by offset.


[14-Mar-25 06:52 PM] jerry.9790#0000
I mean the lack of efficiency due to fertility, would that be covered by the agri boost from COGC?


[14-Mar-25 07:03 PM] jcheung#0000
to a degree, if your alternative was a planet with no cogc, yeah


[14-Mar-25 07:03 PM] jcheung#0000
what's the other options you'rel ooking at


[14-Mar-25 07:03 PM] jcheung#0000
so we can make an educated comparison


[14-Mar-25 07:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Kinda, it’s not going to be as good as planets like say Harmonia or Promitor but better than say Deimos or Phobos


[14-Mar-25 07:47 PM] jerry.9790#0000
For agri base, not sure that area has any other options, than boucher.


[14-Mar-25 07:47 PM] jerry.9790#0000
Or i could look into some other industries

if using fertility is what you want to do (FRM ORC) I say go for it

you seem to be in that area ish


[14-Mar-25 09:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Personally I would say Demeter is better


[14-Mar-25 09:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but thats cause its closer to AI1, more fertile, and also AGRI CoGC


[14-Mar-25 09:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Demeter is 99.57% fertile vs Lemuria at 85.09%


[14-Mar-25 09:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000

and by no means this is me saying don't do this, it is just something you need to consider as you build up your bases and empire


[15-Mar-25 12:15 AM] jerry.9790#0000
got it

Hello, I have slowly collected 1.5 million AIC with my first base (https://prunplanner.org/shared/74667525-e683-4358-8ac1-57ee6e451417). When would you recommend starting another base and in which industry? I've tried to get an overview but just can't get it right. Thanks for your advice 🙂

Depends what do you want to do in this game. Base looks fine. You can have 5 experts max for category and 6 experts total.


[15-Mar-25 09:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
Look into industries and see what you find interesting. Most people make bases of what is profitable and inputs for them


[15-Mar-25 09:27 AM] marat_sh#0000
Metallurgy will lead into construction and ship building. Food industry is always in demand so you can scale infinitely. Chemistry needed almost everywhere and in large quantities. Electronics and manufacturing is a bit of a hit or miss, you get into it if you need something specific from them


[15-Mar-25 11:12 AM] jcheung#0000
An option could be to expand into construction to use some of your AL to produce higher tier goods. Since you've already gotten a grant, mind if this is moved to one of the more general discussion channels? #associate-planning should work


[20-Mar-25 02:42 PM] finestone#0000
@archielvahr I think we should add a 3rd channel to AGP for Grant requests only and make this channel for discussions.

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Mar-25 02:57 PM] jcheung#0000
Actually. Could slowmode this channel and make people create threads


[20-Mar-25 02:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Make a post about what your goals are, then thread off of that


[20-Mar-25 02:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
or a threads only channel


[20-Mar-25 02:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
or a forum channel


[20-Mar-25 02:58 PM] jab.sh#0000
lots of options


[20-Mar-25 03:00 PM] finestone#0000
I dont mind the discussion in here at all. If anything i want to see it so they can come up with a good starting plan and learn from others. I just think the actual Requests get buried sometimes and would be nice to be able to check a channel to see if thier are any pending requests


[20-Mar-25 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I'm not sure what is best. I like how grant requests turn into discussions, and I think the new players learn a lot that way. I think requiring a plan is great and the discussions are basically the way to hook them into the community. Otherwise it is tough for someone new to engage with an established group.

[20-Mar-25 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
That maybe also could be addressed somehow with the grant sheet


[20-Mar-25 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
since it has a request side vs. a fulfilled side.


[20-Mar-25 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know what you mean though, cause I worry someone just got missed after posting something


[20-Mar-25 03:02 PM] jab.sh#0000
you could even formalize it with a bot or something but that might be a little much 😄


[20-Mar-25 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
The bot could add them to the sheet 🤩


[20-Mar-25 03:04 PM] jab.sh#0000
indeed


[20-Mar-25 07:45 PM] spinydeath#0000
Hello, I created a plan to move to ATI  https://prunplanner.org/shared/d1bb01fd-87a6-4c62-8be3-cdbb01ac0b8a I was hoping to get some advice and to apply for the AGP. Thank you for the consideration

[20-Mar-25 08:18 PM] spinydeath#0000
I adjusted the plan to make it more efficient ( Less over production of H2O ) and added the Lux 1,2 in to it


[20-Mar-25 08:21 PM] potaterror#0000
Shouldn't be too hard to get funding for a Harmonia farm bas.e


[20-Mar-25 08:23 PM] spinydeath#0000
It will be my first time in Antares ( in Hortus right now )  so i had to ask for help find a good production plan and Tanda explained it all to me so i just put in the numbers for a starter base just to get it going


[20-Mar-25 08:24 PM] jcheung#0000
heh. you have h2o 5 stack nice and consolidated but HER stack is all split 😂


[20-Mar-25 08:24 PM] jcheung#0000
unless you're really desperate for it, i would replace the RIG with another FRM


[20-Mar-25 08:25 PM] spinydeath#0000
It takes so long to make so i split it so i make 5 in the same amount of time it takes to make one


[20-Mar-25 08:25 PM] spinydeath#0000
Should i just buy the H2O


[20-Mar-25 08:25 PM] jcheung#0000
generally? yeah


[20-Mar-25 08:25 PM] potaterror#0000
Wait, where are you in HRT space?


[20-Mar-25 08:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im based on promitor


[20-Mar-25 08:26 PM] potaterror#0000
TBQH I wouldn't give up Prom.


[20-Mar-25 08:26 PM] jcheung#0000
also why not plan for a full base?


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] spinydeath#0000
I dont know the max i could go with the grant and still have money for operating cost


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] jcheung#0000
design the base as a full base


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im new to prun


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] jcheung#0000
build in parts


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] spinydeath#0000
Gotcha


[20-Mar-25 08:27 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah. so the reason you want to design as a full 500 area base, is because based on your choices your infrastructure may look different


[20-Mar-25 08:28 PM] spinydeath#0000
should i just max out on farms and buy all the other stuff


[20-Mar-25 08:28 PM] jcheung#0000
if you only design half your base and build that, when you go for the other half (not with FRMs though) you might have to break down half your housing to eek out another 4 area


[20-Mar-25 08:28 PM] jcheung#0000
honestly, yeah. the h2o import is so small


[20-Mar-25 08:29 PM] jcheung#0000
for a full 13 FRM 5 expert you're looking at like... 40 h2o a day or something


[20-Mar-25 08:30 PM] potaterror#0000
Also, before you settle in to a build plan, are you looking to be part of larger cooperatives/syndicates, or ultimately wanting to be self-contained?


[20-Mar-25 08:31 PM] spinydeath#0000
I was looking to go at it alone at first


[20-Mar-25 08:32 PM] spinydeath#0000
I dont know much about the coop/syn gameplay


[20-Mar-25 08:32 PM] potaterror#0000
Fair enough. Well, it's hard to really lose with a FRM base. Got plenty of ways to pivot.


[20-Mar-25 08:33 PM] spinydeath#0000
I updated the save with 13 farm and 7 HB1


[20-Mar-25 08:34 PM] spinydeath#0000
I dont know how much i should produce per order thought


[20-Mar-25 08:34 PM] jcheung#0000
i recommend filling out the last little bit with a STO since you can't fit anything else


[20-Mar-25 08:34 PM] spinydeath#0000
I have it set to one just so i can have them complete all at once


[20-Mar-25 08:34 PM] spinydeath#0000
Okay


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
I added 1 STOP


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
STO


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
it doesn't matter. the numbers are only for ratios


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
Should i max them out


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
since you're doing pure HER, you only need 1 HER


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
okay cool


[20-Mar-25 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
since you have PRO, 1 HER on recurring is fine


[20-Mar-25 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
if you didn't have PRO, i would say go for a larger amount


[20-Mar-25 08:36 PM] spinydeath#0000
Does basic let you have recurring. Im still going to pay for pro just curious


[20-Mar-25 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
no


[20-Mar-25 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
which is dumb


[20-Mar-25 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
but no


[20-Mar-25 08:37 PM] jcheung#0000
for free/basic i would stagger it a little, set it up so that roughly once a day one FRM finishes something


[20-Mar-25 08:38 PM] spinydeath#0000
Thats how i have my water production set up


[20-Mar-25 08:38 PM] jcheung#0000
so intial to stagger, then batches of roughly 10ish


[20-Mar-25 08:38 PM] jcheung#0000
less of a concern with HER really, more of a concern with stuff that only takes a couple hours


[20-Mar-25 08:39 PM] spinydeath#0000
With the plan now is it good or should i mess with it some more


[20-Mar-25 08:43 PM] jcheung#0000
this is the same as what you have btw

[20-Mar-25 08:44 PM] jcheung#0000
^


[20-Mar-25 08:44 PM] pagy1234#0000
for me I used 600-700k on the base, and all the rest was spent on consumables and materials that I needed to run it


[20-Mar-25 08:45 PM] pagy1234#0000
tried to manage my money as best as possible but still went down to below 100k at some points


[20-Mar-25 08:45 PM] jcheung#0000
~~i went below 100 at a few points~~

{Reactions}
😆 

[20-Mar-25 08:45 PM] spinydeath#0000
right now it will cost about 550,202 to build


[20-Mar-25 08:45 PM] spinydeath#0000
then the rest would be for consumables and materials


[20-Mar-25 08:46 PM] pagy1234#0000
thats perfect, and for FRM base, you consumables and materials cost will not be super high


[20-Mar-25 08:46 PM] spinydeath#0000
Prun shows me 65189.88 a day


[20-Mar-25 08:46 PM] pagy1234#0000
what planet are you on?


[20-Mar-25 08:46 PM] spinydeath#0000
but a profit of 153,399.22 a day


[20-Mar-25 08:47 PM] jcheung#0000
so what i would consider doing is... buying a few days of supplies, and then sink most of your remaining funds into a DDT ASK order for around 4500/u instead of the 5k/u the asks currently are at


[20-Mar-25 08:47 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im on promitor but this is for me to move to Antares harmonia


[20-Mar-25 08:47 PM] pagy1234#0000
would it not be better to COLIQ and start fresh on harmonia? just my opinion..


[20-Mar-25 08:47 PM] jcheung#0000
or maybe even 4800


[20-Mar-25 08:47 PM] spinydeath#0000
I have a guy in a different channel who said hes going to send me 200 to start

[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] jcheung#0000
prom is hard to get a slot on


[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah but prom and harmonia are miles apart


[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have prom, i would keep it


[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] pagy1234#0000

[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] pagy1234#0000
+300


[20-Mar-25 08:48 PM] spinydeath#0000
I can build more


[20-Mar-25 08:49 PM] spinydeath#0000
i had to spend a bunch on repair when i came back to the game and i restarted with a different production line


[20-Mar-25 08:49 PM] spinydeath#0000
I am currently building it up to max it out again


[20-Mar-25 08:50 PM] spinydeath#0000
I use to make rations and i grew everything


[20-Mar-25 08:50 PM] spinydeath#0000
wait is that people trying to get on promitor


[20-Mar-25 08:51 PM] pagy1234#0000
RATs are great to start, market is super consistent with them aswell lol, never strays too far below MM


[20-Mar-25 08:51 PM] spinydeath#0000
For some reason my profit margin was terrible and i wasnt making good moneyh


[20-Mar-25 08:52 PM] pagy1234#0000
if you were making your own water on prom then I can see why


[20-Mar-25 08:52 PM] jcheung#0000
no, that's available plots on prom. it means that if i want to start a base there, because there are 754 people on the planet, i have to wait for 333 of them to leave or be pruned before i can drop the base


[20-Mar-25 08:52 PM] spinydeath#0000
damn


[20-Mar-25 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
have you been introduced to COGC?


[20-Mar-25 08:53 PM] spinydeath#0000
im not leaving keeping the water base going


[20-Mar-25 08:53 PM] spinydeath#0000
No i have not


[20-Mar-25 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so harmonia and promitor both have a COGC of agriculture. that means that things like FRM will get a 25% buff to their work speed


[20-Mar-25 08:54 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh so i should be growing stuff here


[20-Mar-25 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
RIGs and FRMs are not agriculture, which means they don't get this bonus


[20-Mar-25 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
now, that being said


[20-Mar-25 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
let me check something because at a glance prom's water doesn't look terrible


[20-Mar-25 08:55 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, promitor's water is around 50% better than harmonia, so in a pinch that's not the worst investment. still better to get it elsewhere though


[20-Mar-25 08:55 PM] pagy1234#0000

[20-Mar-25 08:55 PM] pagy1234#0000
for any planet, whatever is being advertised gets a 25% bonus


[20-Mar-25 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
now, the other thing with industries is that if you have more than one, you need to split experts. if you have agri, extraction, food... you have to split experts 3 ways, which is really painful


[20-Mar-25 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
as such if you can help it, keep to 2 industries max on a planet, and one should match COGC


[20-Mar-25 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
ideally one industry and it matches COGC, or is just an extraction base on a high yield world


[20-Mar-25 08:57 PM] spinydeath#0000
Do you think it would be a good idea to get to about 1 mil ICA and start a growing operations like the one im trying to start in antares


[20-Mar-25 08:57 PM] jcheung#0000
maybe. it might actually not be a terrible idea to also go slightly further down the chain and process the HER into the next tier of good


[20-Mar-25 08:58 PM] spinydeath#0000
So the next level of rations i think right


[20-Mar-25 08:58 PM] jcheung#0000
FIM


[20-Mar-25 08:59 PM] pagy1234#0000
works on the same base as RAT which makes it very easy to swap too


[20-Mar-25 08:59 PM] jcheung#0000
^


[20-Mar-25 08:59 PM] pagy1234#0000
Im about to do the change myself :D


[20-Mar-25 08:59 PM] jcheung#0000
now, a base full of FPs is a bit more shipping intensive than a base of FRMs


[20-Mar-25 09:00 PM] jcheung#0000
so keep that in mind if you go that route


[20-Mar-25 09:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, depending on what you are making you could be going to the base almost every day


[20-Mar-25 09:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
especially because you wont have the money to build up a large buffer


[20-Mar-25 09:02 PM] spinydeath#0000
would i want to buy the rations and just process them into the FIM with the HER


[20-Mar-25 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
probably


[20-Mar-25 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
also duplicating this base on prom isn't the worst idea, but i would wait until your next repair cycle to do so unless you're making really bad money on prom


[20-Mar-25 09:04 PM] spinydeath#0000
I only make about 86,400 before expenses


[20-Mar-25 09:04 PM] spinydeath#0000
every couple days


[20-Mar-25 09:20 PM] jcheung#0000
well


[20-Mar-25 09:20 PM] spinydeath#0000
yeah thanks to you i know why its so bad


[20-Mar-25 09:21 PM] jcheung#0000
that's not the worst base, if you had it more fleshed out


[20-Mar-25 09:21 PM] spinydeath#0000
Thank you for that btw now i can fix it


[20-Mar-25 09:21 PM] spinydeath#0000
Its just hard to get he money to do it


[20-Mar-25 09:21 PM] jcheung#0000
the real pain point is that you only have part of the base built so it's slow going


[20-Mar-25 09:22 PM] spinydeath#0000
it took me forever to get the 350000 to build what i have now


[20-Mar-25 09:22 PM] jcheung#0000
realistically running 9FP 25 RIG 11 HB1 isn't terrible, even without COGC


[20-Mar-25 09:23 PM] spinydeath#0000
let me change the plan so i can see


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] spinydeath#0000
its showing i would be short 10 workers


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
yes


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] spinydeath#0000
does that just slow production


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
in my opinion, sometimes it's worth eating a small loss


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, it slows proportionally to how much is missing


[20-Mar-25 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
so it's like


[20-Mar-25 09:25 PM] jcheung#0000
a 1% drop but you can fit another entire production building


[20-Mar-25 09:25 PM] jcheung#0000
at least for that specific example


[20-Mar-25 09:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
okay thats not bad


[20-Mar-25 09:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
Any idea how to remove the extra STO i built one when i was doing RATs and i cant figure out how to remove it


[20-Mar-25 09:26 PM] spinydeath#0000
its not in my buildings tab

You might need to expand the infrastructure section


[20-Mar-25 09:27 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah. you can even get rid of some more RIGs if you switch to the PG recipe (but it might be lower profit)


[20-Mar-25 09:27 PM] jcheung#0000
should be under infrastructure

oh. sorry, i have an extension modifying it


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] jcheung#0000
scroll down to the bottom of infrastructure


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] jcheung#0000
it'll be right under all the housing


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] spinydeath#0000
its called a WAR


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] jcheung#0000
oh


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] spinydeath#0000
i think i pay for it instead of building it


[20-Mar-25 09:30 PM] jcheung#0000
that's not a STO


[20-Mar-25 09:31 PM] spinydeath#0000
ohh does it not take up building space then


[20-Mar-25 09:31 PM] jcheung#0000
right, doesn't take up building space


[20-Mar-25 09:31 PM] jcheung#0000
open up the PLI


[20-Mar-25 09:31 PM] jcheung#0000
then go to warehouse


[20-Mar-25 09:31 PM] jcheung#0000
you can rent or cancel a unit there


[20-Mar-25 09:32 PM] spinydeath#0000
would it be a bad idea just to keep it


[20-Mar-25 09:32 PM] jcheung#0000
no, i usually have them on all the planets i'm at and a few i'm not at


[20-Mar-25 09:32 PM] jcheung#0000
it clutters up the list a little though


[20-Mar-25 09:32 PM] jcheung#0000
but they're generally not too expensive


[20-Mar-25 09:33 PM] evany.#0000
I personally go through once a month and delete all that I’m not using


[20-Mar-25 09:33 PM] spinydeath#0000
Im just going to keep it then i like separating my building mats and fuel away from production resources


[20-Mar-25 09:33 PM] evany.#0000
but yeah generally they are basically cheap as hell


[20-Mar-25 09:33 PM] jcheung#0000
they're really nice when you're running a base that's a little tight on storage


[20-Mar-25 09:34 PM] jcheung#0000
pain in the ass to swap back and forth sometimes, but great in a pinch


[20-Mar-25 09:34 PM] jcheung#0000
the thing with STOs is, they're awesome, but you often have to choose between more income or an easier time with the base


[20-Mar-25 09:35 PM] spinydeath#0000
should i keep the STO on the HER base


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] spinydeath#0000
it will be -15 on pop


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
so for that one


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
it doesn't affect pop at all


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
it takes 15 area


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
but you can't place anything there anyways


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] spinydeath#0000
i see now i was reading it wrong


[20-Mar-25 09:36 PM] jcheung#0000
so slotting the STO later on when you have money is just an ease of life thing


[20-Mar-25 09:37 PM] spinydeath#0000
Gotcha just want to say thank you for all the help


[21-Mar-25 06:47 PM] batman_project#0000
Would I qualify for the grant? I’d like the mil because I’d probably stock up on supplies for the workers. Also how does it work if I’m the only base on that planet? Why is no one else there for gold?

[21-Mar-25 06:48 PM] evany.#0000
if your only base on the planet your gonna need to attract workers and have a lot of other overhead


[21-Mar-25 06:49 PM] evany.#0000
youll also be governor or whatever and need to meet other upkeeps, settling a new planet while your part of agp channel is likely probably one of the worst things you can do


[21-Mar-25 06:49 PM] igfloz#0000
I don't think this qualifies for a grant personally


[21-Mar-25 06:49 PM] evany.#0000
if your established and can wait a few weeks for workers and such its probably not a big deal.. but if your new my friend do not do this.


[21-Mar-25 06:52 PM] batman_project#0000
Okay no problem I’ll find something else over there in Antares. And play around with prunplanner


[21-Mar-25 06:52 PM] evany.#0000

Might I recommend ZV-194d instead?


[21-Mar-25 07:01 PM] batman_project#0000
That is closer to station probably could smelt it as well.


[21-Mar-25 07:01 PM] batman_project#0000
I’ll do all the math and see how I could do it under a million


[21-Mar-25 07:10 PM] jcheung#0000
for the future, it helps to also include which buildings you plan to make


[21-Mar-25 07:12 PM] jcheung#0000
that way whoever is considering giving grant money has a good idea on what you're building and can have a more informed idea of what you're trying to do


[21-Mar-25 07:13 PM] jcheung#0000
from that list at a glance i have no idea if that's a base of EXTs or a combination of EXT and SME or something else (not that i have grant money)


[21-Mar-25 07:14 PM] jcheung#0000
don't worry about making the base as a whole under 1m. present the full base design, and then build part of it that's within your budget


[21-Mar-25 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
keep in mind that the reason we ask you to lay out what you want to build is to help you steer clear of pitfalls


[21-Mar-25 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
I would ask if you're going to do a AU/AUO base, do you think you can haul all that?


[21-Mar-25 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
gold is heavy heavy


[21-Mar-25 07:19 PM] batman_project#0000
Auo simple simple base


[21-Mar-25 07:19 PM] jcheung#0000
gold gets even heavier once refined as well


[21-Mar-25 07:23 PM] jcheung#0000
as a side note, the reason why QJ-650c and ZV-194d were being recommended to you was because
1) they're half the jumps to CX
2) their gold yield is significantly better than LS-300e - 92% and 57% respectively (194 is metallurgy though, so it offers benefits to in situ refining)


[21-Mar-25 07:24 PM] tanda#0000
and upcycling, as FS for BGO>BGC RGO>HCC are metallurgy as well

[21-Mar-25 07:26 PM] tanda#0000

okay ill work in a smelter process and see how it goes


[22-Mar-25 12:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Connectors are very easy to move. Like HCC. But it can be tough to do the EXT and SME and FS all in one spot.


[22-Mar-25 12:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Is Fs metallurgy? I forget. Maybe it’s not tough

[22-Mar-25 03:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
@batman_project so, if I get the right you’re planning on moving to ANT with the grant to setup an gold extraction base?


[22-Mar-25 03:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Then welcome on my turf 😏


[22-Mar-25 03:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
How many ships do you have and with which capacity? Because if you think about extraction ore and refining it, you always have to think about shipping, too


[22-Mar-25 03:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Do you have any other markets you’re currently getting cash from? The gold market is more or less saturated and slow moving, so there is not much liquidity to gain there


[22-Mar-25 03:42 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Honestly, I have enough AUO overflow, that I could support at least a second SME base, if you really insist on going that path, but I don’t recommend it as one of the first bases


[22-Mar-25 03:43 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, I will work on that eventually


[22-Mar-25 03:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
My target (for AU) on the CX is actually 1,200 - but people keep on buying it at that point 😂


[22-Mar-25 06:36 AM] batman_project#0000
i only have two ships. ima be thinkin long and hard ill come at you guys with a fleshed out plan in a couple days

Solid base to start with, join a corp eventually and adapt to their needs


[23-Mar-25 03:11 PM] tanda#0000
Alright, with a Deimos start, you might want to talk to Jab about the DNPC coop. I think It pays out in BFABs, which you can either sell or use to build further industry


[23-Mar-25 03:11 PM] tanda#0000
you can pick that up separately from your Grant, too


[23-Mar-25 03:11 PM] tanda#0000
so pull a twofer and maybe use the grant to start up a HER base on Harmonia


[23-Mar-25 03:12 PM] tanda#0000
That's a really simple base, just need a bit of startup capital for the FRMs and the initial DDT


[23-Mar-25 03:12 PM] tanda#0000
It's also expandable, as you can drop an FP base and process your own HER into FIM afterwards

You want planets to generally focus on one or two things as best you can. RIGs do make sense, but if you're growing HER, you're importing so little it doesn't even matter


[23-Mar-25 03:48 PM] tanda#0000
actually if you're willing to not use a STO and just run out of the warehouse, you could fit one RIG on the base, It takes care of a lot of your water usage, but not all of it

Oooo


[23-Mar-25 04:18 PM] tanda#0000
supplies, not luxuries. So that includes the somewhat expensive DDT the base will need


[23-Mar-25 04:20 PM] tarrant1113#0000
still nice though


[23-Mar-25 04:21 PM] tanda#0000
something important to note since markets can be volatile. In conjunction with an FP base on Norwick, this base can easily provide for producing FIM (if the market stays steady as it is) or pivot to doing RAT or INC (with a base on Nascent)


[23-Mar-25 04:22 PM] tanda#0000
so if DDT goes missing from the market or spikes too bad, or if HER drops in a hole, you can just change what you're doing

Hi, I'd like to apply for a grant to make this base. I already have a 750 base on Harmonia making HER, so this FP base for making FIM is step two in my three step master plan. https://prunplanner.org/shared/50b4aa10-dd54-4fba-8fc1-efe40b6a42aa

Step three is to use the profits from these bases to fund a base on Griffonstone making DDT

[25-Mar-25 06:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
you could definitely add an extra FP to that base, and i would recommend a STO aswell since you have the area for it. your choice tho


[25-Mar-25 06:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
other wise its pretty much exactly like my first base :D


[25-Mar-25 06:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
which i also got through this grant system


[25-Mar-25 06:57 AM] sansemin#0000
Yeah but adding another would consume more HER than my Harmonia base can produce


[25-Mar-25 06:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
How are you getting enough from 1 frm base?


[25-Mar-25 06:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have 2 frm bases, one harmonia, one phobos, and i still dont make enough?


[25-Mar-25 07:08 AM] sansemin#0000
A 3 permit base on Harmonia with 5 experts makes 83.95 HER/d, with 27 FRM only making HER


[25-Mar-25 07:09 AM] sansemin#0000
A 1 permit base on Norwick with 5 experts needs 83.46 HER/d, with 26 FP only making FIM


[25-Mar-25 07:17 AM] tanda#0000
How does the rate of return look for you if you include the cost of the extra permits in your ROI calculations?


[25-Mar-25 07:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ahh, ok i see


[25-Mar-25 07:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thats why


[25-Mar-25 09:14 AM] sansemin#0000
I dunno, is it possible to add that through planner?


[25-Mar-25 09:15 AM] sansemin#0000
I played a couple of years ago and had a pretty big empire, I know +1 permit bases aren't the most cost effective but for me it balances out having to constantly ping ships around between a higher number of individual bases

[25-Mar-25 09:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
dont think so, but the math isnt too difficult, just (prunplanner base cost, + XIT HQUC [HQ lvl#] -> [HQ lvl#] cost) / prunplanner profit


[25-Mar-25 09:25 AM] sansemin#0000
Omfg thank you for mentioning XIT, I knew I used to use a plugin but I couldn't remember what it was called

[25-Mar-25 09:27 AM] sansemin#0000
Yeah just found it


[25-Mar-25 09:28 AM] sansemin#0000

[25-Mar-25 10:57 AM] batman_project#0000
eventually with a surplus on nitrogen i can start up another base that makes NS or something, or make deals with people that already do that

would this qualify for grant?

probably would start with 3 habs and 10 extractors then build off that


[25-Mar-25 10:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
1. I would consider putting a STO into the plan. Otherwise your base will be filled up after just a day and stop producing


[25-Mar-25 11:00 AM] laaxus#0000
Do you have enough shipping capacity


[25-Mar-25 11:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
^ that was my second question 😅😂


[25-Mar-25 11:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It’s always about the shipping


[25-Mar-25 11:02 AM] batman_project#0000
i just hace two starter ships atm


[25-Mar-25 11:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And thirdly -  did you check, if you can sell all of that N. Somebody has to check me on that, but you would produce nearly all of the daily traded amount alone


[25-Mar-25 11:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This will probably be not enough

[25-Mar-25 11:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It’s not a bad plan per se, but might be a bit early atm. Something with less shipping requirements would be more affordable


[25-Mar-25 11:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
CL is a good call (or chemicals overall). Agriculture and food is easy, too.


[25-Mar-25 11:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Resource extraction is something more mid-game, when you have a bit more shipping capacity on hand


[25-Mar-25 11:09 AM] batman_project#0000
dang why is that N so heavy?


[25-Mar-25 11:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It isn’t


[25-Mar-25 11:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It’s just a lot


[25-Mar-25 11:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Nearly 1,400 units per day is quite a handful 😅


[25-Mar-25 11:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could start with a not fully build up base, but at that point I would consider using the permit for something else


[25-Mar-25 11:12 AM] batman_project#0000
yeah let me cook up something else, i know anteres needs brm but there is no planet thats actually anteras that has it


[25-Mar-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
If in doubt, go for something generic that will guaranteed sell, then later you can always expand

I went for a RAT and DW mix at the beginning, then now I changed to making my own HER to process into FIM.

Should I redo this, or am I waiting for someone to come online to check it out?


[25-Mar-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
How much does this cost to make?


[25-Mar-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
Build*


[25-Mar-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
I would recomend that for the grant, dont exceed 700k direct spending, because building a buffer for all materials costs alot


[25-Mar-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
And you will be spending s bunch of money before you get the first products to finally sell


[25-Mar-25 11:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
So imo just build as much as you can with the grant, then expand the base slowly later


[25-Mar-25 11:27 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thats what i did when i got my grant for norwick


[25-Mar-25 11:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
This was what I had going back then^


[25-Mar-25 11:29 AM] sansemin#0000
Planner says 556k to build and ~6 days ROI, that doesn't take into account the fact that I already have a base making HER though


[25-Mar-25 11:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
The second STO was barely useful and I only did it because at the time I though STO added only 1k/1k, not 5k/5k


[25-Mar-25 11:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
Consumables will be maybe 50k ontop? Yeah you are probably safe on that


[25-Mar-25 11:31 AM] sansemin#0000
Ah hang on, construction cart says 732k and consumables is about 30k per week


[25-Mar-25 11:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
I had to spend less since H2O costed quite alot


[25-Mar-25 11:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Imo you are cutting it a bit close, do you have significant cash on hand already?


[25-Mar-25 11:32 AM] sansemin#0000
328k


[25-Mar-25 11:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
Not bad, tbh this plan should be fine, make sure you get your construction materials from #internal-offers and your construction cart will probably go down to low 600k's


[25-Mar-25 11:35 AM] pagy1234#0000

[25-Mar-25 01:00 PM] batman_project#0000
SE-110c this to start for a DW base. could easily be upgraded and even with maxed out permits a starter ship can handle all shipping needs. would this qualify for grant?

issue is despite having the best newbie starting planet, the actual region is mostly a deadzone. Very few colonized planets and systems, with little in the way of help should a new player try to expand in the same region

I guess I can’t decide - on the one hand, more money is good, and it’s not a bad idea to maintain a stronger offer than the other guys™️. But on the other hand, I’m not sure how useful an extra 500k is or isn’t


[30-Mar-25 07:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
But we do have a lot of things other folks don’t. Co-op projects, big community, PSK especially. Maybe it’s better to lean more into those things?

We could do two grants totalling 2m. A first one on the spot, a second one later down the line?


[30-Mar-25 07:07 PM] manhim#0000
Would've been quite useful to me. To a new player it represents 50% more than their net worth after the first grant.


[30-Mar-25 07:07 PM] manhim#0000
Most bases now cost more than 1m to build

[30-Mar-25 07:08 PM] tanda#0000

It was good for a whole month when I started 😄 then it went downhill


[30-Mar-25 07:17 PM] manhim#0000
I guess we should probably think about which bases would be good for beginners and grant according to that


[30-Mar-25 07:18 PM] jab.sh#0000
pay for the base plus 500k or something?


[30-Mar-25 07:20 PM] manhim#0000
Not necessarily. I think a fixed amount is always more marketable.


[30-Mar-25 07:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that gets messy


[30-Mar-25 07:21 PM] manhim#0000
But if the bases we'd like to see beginners do all fit within 1m, then 1m is fine. I'm just not sure if that's the case.


[30-Mar-25 07:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i took a loan to get my first base fully kitted out

I always feel bad having a say in these matters since I'm usually so cash poor I've only funded two grants


[30-Mar-25 09:44 PM] pagy1234#0000
nah no really


[30-Mar-25 09:47 PM] pagy1234#0000
the grant is well large enough to give a pretty decent source of income to build off of, I was able to get I think around 70k (?) per day just off what the grant build for me


[30-Mar-25 09:51 PM] pagy1234#0000
after that its pretty simple to expand since 70k is like ~2 new buildings on that base every day.


[30-Mar-25 09:52 PM] pagy1234#0000
I feel like if it was to be increased, It would have to be by a pretty large margin since anyways only 60-70% of the grant could go to buildings straight away, rest goes to consumables and inputs. so increasing by 250k wouldnt have probably changed anything if I were to recieve the grant again as a newbie


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] joshuastronomy#0000
If I had my base setup funded in exchange for COLIQing, would the grant be double-dipping?


[30-Mar-25 09:56 PM] tanda#0000
If you COLIQued after receiving the grant, most sponsors wouldn't touch you


[30-Mar-25 09:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do like the idea of a followup grant. A few of the grants I gave recently had the person leaving the game sort of shortly after they joined. (they didn't give me the DW and when i sent the cancel request, I noticed they were marked inactive). So a follow-up grant would be a way to 1) Keep the money used effectively and 2) Provide a little something to look forward to.

It also is less overwhelming to get it all at once, and maybe the second grant comes right as the base from the first grant is getting "boring", so the steady dopamine hit helps with retention


[30-Mar-25 10:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you coliqed and got a payment from someone for that, then you can still get the grant. ADI doesn't  have an official "COLIQ for Money" program, so whoever gave you that cash did it on their own. (assuming I'm understanding that correctly)

Ok yeah, it's that, I'm not going to COLIQ again, I just want to hit the ground running buying inputs.

[30-Mar-25 10:04 PM] manhim#0000
I offer O on the internal market if you need. My FLX is more of a reserve, so priced higher.

Right on.  I'll put in for the grant then, thank you.


[30-Mar-25 10:22 PM] potaterror#0000

[31-Mar-25 01:22 AM] jab.sh#0000
AA grants are independent of AGP, at least that's how I understand it, but of course it's up to the discretion of the grant funders. I do appreciate you being up front about it at least 🙂


[31-Mar-25 01:26 AM] jab.sh#0000
yeah trying to fill 5 Deimos spots was not exactly easy 😅


[31-Mar-25 02:01 AM] vanarazor#0000
the firsst time I arrived on the server I wanted the grant but I did not want someone more experience to break in down to much for me ..


[31-Mar-25 02:02 AM] vanarazor#0000
now I get the value of experienced player expertise


[31-Mar-25 05:04 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I certainly could have used more, I think I was able to build about 1/3 of a BMP base on Heph once accounting for needing inputs.

It was certainly appreciated (and made starting the game tolerable!), but it didn't seem like it would pay for even an inexpensive full base (especailly when my first base still had a tremendous amount of area free).

If there is a model for a follow up grant, that would definitely be interesting.  And, while I would  have wanted more, I think even using 1M up front can be a bit overwhelming as well if you're used to having at most 10k, so a way to get another 500k a week or two later would be a reasonable compromise.  (Maybe something like "leaderboard shows production from your grant base at roughly expected level")


[31-Mar-25 12:39 PM] evany.#0000
i'm sympathetic to this plight, we've talked a ton about it on voice in various groups
but if your relying on another player to stave off the churn that the game is having, its probably someone that will never be along term player anyway.

not to say there is anything wrong with short term retention from a fellow players perspective, but doesn't bode very well in the long term for player retention and health of the game in general.
The issue is I think the scale/size of starter bases with no easy access.

I hate that I even think of it but I suspect it will likely be better if they offer a 'faster but longer' tutorial.
Maybe make it 7 days and as they complete parts of it give them access to batches of materials as rewards that are way under CX.
A virtucaller makes 2300aic/day according to prunplanner which is 20+ days just to build 1 additional FRM


[31-Mar-25 12:40 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I have not been a beneficiary of the AGP but I do have some input:
- Maybe consider increasing the grant ceiling but make it a case by case thing. If the plan is actually very good, grant the full money. If its not a very expansive plan, which isn't using the maximum grant then issue what is requested.
- If the player is too new, issue grants in installments. 50% now, 50% 2 weeks later maybe?


[31-Mar-25 12:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don't personally like the idea of increasing the grant on a case-by-case basis because it'll penalize new players who choose a cheaper base

[31-Mar-25 12:46 PM] evany.#0000
my two cents, the grant amount is fine leave it up to grantor whether they want to do 1.5 instead of 1 or something along those lines. 1mil is still really good depending on the base type
a lot of beginner bases are still 6-700k to build out leaving 300k for consumables


[31-Mar-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
1m is good, 1,5M is better


[31-Mar-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
We want the newcommers to start in antares


[31-Mar-25 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think a follow-up approach could make sense, because 1) it encourages people to stay active in the server a bit longer, and 2) we probably won't need to track it closely because the grantees probably won't let us forget about their extra grant 😛


[31-Mar-25 12:49 PM] jab.sh#0000
1m is good, 1.5m is better, 2m is too much? 😆

[31-Mar-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
Then maybe we could give them a higher grant, but not in cash, and advertised differently


[31-Mar-25 12:51 PM] laaxus#0000
For example, project CORGI could start paying for leased bases


[31-Mar-25 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
We need to offer better services, and then advertise it


[31-Mar-25 12:53 PM] sidepipe#0000

[31-Mar-25 12:53 PM] moke.#0000
Just my 2 cents,

I only got a grant at 250k when I started, and did fine starting in Harmonia. 

I think the bigger issue is the amount of time it takes to be profitable once you've established a new starter base. Someone new isn't going to want to wait 2+ weeks to see any profits, grant or not. 

Artificially cratering the price on low-tier/easy to make items to be cheap for them is simultaneously making it difficult for them to get started without jumping into more complicated chains, and not everyone is going to want to handle right off the bat even with guidance.


[31-Mar-25 12:54 PM] laaxus#0000
Low cost base Never have been as profitable as right now


[31-Mar-25 12:54 PM] jab.sh#0000

[31-Mar-25 12:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
FWIW, I also started with a 250k grant, but that was 400+ days ago, and RATs were ~80/u back then 😄


[31-Mar-25 12:55 PM] moke.#0000
And yet you want everything to be a 15 day ROI at least 🙂


[31-Mar-25 12:56 PM] moke.#0000
Lower RoI leads to faster profits, number go up means they're happy and stick around


[31-Mar-25 12:56 PM] laaxus#0000
That's what I initialy wished for but couldn't make it viable. I've updated the profitability to a minimum of 100k/d


[31-Mar-25 12:56 PM] moke.#0000
I don't think there should be a perceived minimum or maximum, let the market decide.

[31-Mar-25 12:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Anyway, I'm not against increasing the grant. Doing it in two phases might be nice but could be confusing - on the one hand, more engagement, but on the other hand, you might not get to drop your whole base at once. But I think advertising $1M grant + new player support + co-op projects + 0 upfront cost ship upgrades + free building materials from BASED is probably above and beyond what anyone else can offer at this point

{Reactions}

[31-Mar-25 12:59 PM] razenpok#0000
Free building materials from BASED can also be a selling point. It's approximately 250k of free stuff per base.

The point is, just because the prices are lower doesn't make it "better", lfabs in particular are low enough entry that new players should be making that for money

I dare you to find the last time an agp applicant made a pp2 base with grant


[31-Mar-25 01:06 PM] moke.#0000
Why so mad?


[31-Mar-25 01:07 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not mad, you're the one going out of context


[31-Mar-25 01:07 PM] jvaler#0000
it's been months afaik. there was one player i guided towards it on nike when AL SME were poor profits but none since then


[31-Mar-25 01:07 PM] laaxus#0000
Players will decide themselves what to do with the grant


[31-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
They can make the most profitable base


[31-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
or they can make something that is not the most profitable


[31-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
some players follow what the market dictates


[31-Mar-25 01:08 PM] laaxus#0000
and some don't


[31-Mar-25 01:09 PM] moke.#0000
Talk about going out of context, I never said who should make what with their grant money, I used lfabs as an example to my point of low-tier/easy to make items, that are easier logistically for new players, shouldn't be artificially lowered to the point that it makes little sense to make that base.


[31-Mar-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
LTA is pretty profitable right now


[31-Mar-25 01:10 PM] laaxus#0000
anyway, a new players should probably not do a PP2 base, because of the logistic issues


[31-Mar-25 01:11 PM] moke.#0000
But it should be their decision I thought?


[31-Mar-25 01:11 PM] laaxus#0000
oh it can


[31-Mar-25 01:11 PM] jvaler#0000
although PSK does exist. but that's up to them if they want that 1.35mil debt


[31-Mar-25 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000
If a new player ask for feedback, I would discourage a PP2 base until they have both their starter ships upgraded


[31-Mar-25 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000
but up to them to try


[31-Mar-25 01:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
we can always subsidize part of the first ship instead of increasing the grant, or offer two options. 1.5M cash or 1M + .85M loan + ship upgrade


[31-Mar-25 01:13 PM] laaxus#0000
1M + one free ship upgrade might be the new program ?


[31-Mar-25 01:13 PM] laaxus#0000
I like that


[31-Mar-25 01:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
but since jvaler has done all the ship loans except for one, that's probably up to them


[31-Mar-25 01:14 PM] pxlfox.#0000
The discussion is about whether we want to give out a second grant after one already received one, isn’t it?


[31-Mar-25 01:14 PM] laaxus#0000
this discussion is a mess


[31-Mar-25 01:15 PM] evany.#0000
i looked the other day and i couldn't even find a valid ADI post - just  you asking for the old one to be deleted


[31-Mar-25 01:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
My summary is
- Do we increase the grant to 1.5M?
- if so, do we offer it in one lump sum or over time?
- Do we leave the grant the same and lean more into our other offerings?


[31-Mar-25 01:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
The whole reason of ADI is to support and build up the region, right? So the goal of the grant program is to get players faster to a point they have a meaningful role in the economy and keep them playing, right?


[31-Mar-25 01:17 PM] laaxus#0000
I like the idea of 1M + one ship upgrade, but 2.5M worth per person might be too much ?


[31-Mar-25 01:17 PM] evany.#0000
i'd like to see an example of your idea of a starter base. 

Most of the starts that im familiar with (FRM & SME) are 40k/day max


[31-Mar-25 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
FRM is very profitable right now


[31-Mar-25 01:18 PM] laaxus#0000
Idem for HAL and CHP (tho it requires ship upgrade)


[31-Mar-25 01:19 PM] laaxus#0000
FP is also very profitable

ah, I see


[31-Mar-25 01:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
we should just copy the perks from ADI over to the AGP post 🙂

[31-Mar-25 01:21 PM] evany.#0000
thank you


[31-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
i feel like it'll be worse visibility if something like PSK is under a header of AGP. the title should be more generalist and each perk given equal weight?


[31-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
cause afaik we have loads of ship kits and nobody to sell them to


[31-Mar-25 01:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don't think it's a bad idea to advertise PSK seperately as well


[31-Mar-25 01:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
but just add it under the AGP post so if someone is shopping for a grant, they also see all the other cool stuff we do here


[31-Mar-25 01:23 PM] evany.#0000
i'm good with keeping PSK under ADI/AGP, god knows it wouldn't be alive with out help from a ton of people here


[31-Mar-25 01:23 PM] realharvey#0000
Anyone on the computer that can check how many of the grant receivers have actually stayed in the game? 
Before considering upping the grant amount we should ensure good player retention


[31-Mar-25 01:23 PM] jvaler#0000
ah okay, just mention it in the AGP post and have it link to PSK. i like that

In my books, that’s a win


[31-Mar-25 01:31 PM] pxlfox.#0000
A bonus after a month or so after a month to keep players in the game sounds effective


[31-Mar-25 01:31 PM] pxlfox.#0000
And a 50% discount for a PSK upgrade after 3 months


[31-Mar-25 01:31 PM] realharvey#0000
Thank you !


[31-Mar-25 01:32 PM] evany.#0000
i'm boucing between things but if anyone can think of an automated way to pull the last 180days rather than my spot checking i'd like to see the whole thing


[31-Mar-25 01:34 PM] realharvey#0000
I'd say we don't overload new people with tons of benefits then. Start with the grant as is any a Pak discount after 14 days?


[31-Mar-25 01:36 PM] evany.#0000
we might want to drop this into a thread - though i suppose its technically still ontopic for #agp-operations 

something that was talked about the other day was how many people have guest "passes"  they have no intention of using ? i know i have like 5 or so


[31-Mar-25 01:42 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
One thing I definately did not appreciate as a new player is just how crazy cheap many of the internal offers are compared to the CX, and this makes a massive difference in growth.  Its a key part of ADI, but its certainly not the path of least resistance.


[31-Mar-25 01:44 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
One interesting thing about the first ship upgrade being subsidized is that it is naturally a "second" grant, since most players won't need it immediately anyway.


[31-Mar-25 01:45 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I have been wondering how to (or even if I should) apply my guest passes to AGP, it feels awkward currently.


[31-Mar-25 01:46 PM] evany.#0000
well I believe sidepipe made a good point earlier, it would feel bad if X gets it but a day later i join as Y and I see X got something I didn't. thats my only fear for the passes it would have to be clear first come first serve "as supplies last"


[31-Mar-25 01:47 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, thus the "if" part.  I dunno.  I'm doing nothing with mine though.


[31-Mar-25 01:47 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I also don't feel like "come to ADI for free pro" is a great model either but maybe that's just lack of foresight.


[31-Mar-25 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
separate issue, not sure i'd want to advertise that.  but while we're discussing this

[01-Apr-25 09:53 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah for context: we always wanted to push up to 1 mil, but 2 of our 3 main supporters are from very communist/socialist corps with lots of production focus and most of our wealth in the form of materials, not cash. So we're adding a big construction material bundle to our grant. Just a generic bunch of bfabs, MCG, and a CM kit. Nothing fancy. I think the part of BEST that I'm most proud of is our new player FAQ document, which pairs well with the grant since we don't have any major co-ops like you do here (yet...). I think Antares benefits most from the *combination* of grant money feeding into co-ops. Benten's co-ops are just it's corps... so it's not keeping up


[01-Apr-25 10:04 AM] jvaler#0000

[01-Apr-25 09:12 PM] smangy.#0000
Hi Everyone. I have put together a plan and would like to apply for a grant. Still learning the game and PRUNplanner. Please let me know if i can optimize anything.

Grant Application:

Base 1 - Farming World - Harmonia - Cost $440,026 (without CM) https://prunplanner.org/shared/efc34ffd-45d9-495f-a1ac-fa534ee51767

Base 2 - RAT Production World - Norwick - Cost $1,030,621 (including CM)
https://prunplanner.org/shared/32021df5-3d89-4bfc-a01e-ed47c769b8a2

From here, not sure what the best order here is yet but base #3 and 4 would  be a) water extraction base that would support the farming and could also feed base #2's FPs on drinking water and b) another farming world to feed the FP

I have read some of the discussion above and would ask for the $1.5M which would be just enough to kit out my first two planets. Also let me know of any advice on the plans, it took me awhile to figure this out !

[01-Apr-25 09:26 PM] pagy1234#0000
my advice: remove the FP from Harmonia, and use the BEA + GRN + NUT recipe to make RAT because iirc its cheaper (way less water usage) , then also balance out your ratios to make sure that you are producing the same amount of each of the 3 products. On Norwick I would heavily recommend that you add a STO, the 2.3 day storage fill time its pretty bad, and it will severely limit you in the future if you dont add one at the beginning.


[01-Apr-25 09:26 PM] pagy1234#0000
also for your future expansion, H2O isnt super great because ROI kinda sucks


[01-Apr-25 09:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
ah and BTW, you should not use more than 60-70% of the total grant value since consumables and inputs to get started costs alot more than you would maybe think.


[01-Apr-25 09:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
just my opinion, probably wait for a more experieced person to share their ideas aswell.


[01-Apr-25 09:30 PM] smangy.#0000
The FP and RIG already exist on Harmonia unfortunately, i built it while following the tutorial. It will get demo'd when the condition goes down and I need the area.


[01-Apr-25 09:31 PM] smangy.#0000
Noted on the recipes, thanks. I did not know about STO/storage so that is a good shout, thanks.


[01-Apr-25 09:34 PM] smangy.#0000
Fair point. I would get the farm world fully settled first.

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Apr-25 10:08 PM] smangy.#0000
Okay updated. I see why that recipe is signficantly more water efficient.


[01-Apr-25 10:08 PM] pagy1234#0000
nice :D


[01-Apr-25 10:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
ah ok, you could probably leave it then, I dont think you need a STO on harmonia, at least I dont have one


[01-Apr-25 10:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
good start tbh


[01-Apr-25 10:10 PM] smangy.#0000
Seems fairly low complexity, and then I can jump off from here


[01-Apr-25 10:10 PM] smangy.#0000
Thanks


[01-Apr-25 10:11 PM] smangy.#0000
i see the storage button now too


[01-Apr-25 10:11 PM] smangy.#0000
so many buttons !!


[01-Apr-25 10:11 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah absolutely


[01-Apr-25 10:11 PM] pagy1234#0000
takes a while to figure out alot of the functions \


[01-Apr-25 10:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, also by the looks of it, your Harmonia base doesnt fully supply the Norwick base, I would recommened DW as a secondary production, with H2O being bought from CX aswell


[01-Apr-25 10:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
plenty to be made with FP's


[01-Apr-25 10:14 PM] pagy1234#0000
when you are happy with your plan, ping Jvaler or any of the other contributors listed in the #agp-information page, they can pass you the grant if they think its all good :D


[01-Apr-25 10:20 PM] smangy.#0000
This is exactly whati was thinking and is why i was thinking a water world or farming world would work well after this


[01-Apr-25 10:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, but H2O doensnt have the best ROI close to ANT, I think Etherwind should be pretty decent in terms of ROI, but its a bit far, and H2O is something you will be moving multiple times a week because of how heavy it is


[01-Apr-25 10:21 PM] smangy.#0000
Going to go to bed shortly, i'll ping in the morning maybe if no one sees


[01-Apr-25 10:22 PM] smangy.#0000
Ice Station Alpha is not far so i thought maybe i could make a profitable plan


[01-Apr-25 10:22 PM] vanarazor#0000
hahah I had the same idea when I started 50 dasy ago


[01-Apr-25 10:22 PM] pagy1234#0000
my ISA base has a 39d ROI, which isnt good at all for early game


[01-Apr-25 10:22 PM] pagy1234#0000
generally you would want somthing under 20-30d ROI


[01-Apr-25 10:23 PM] vanarazor#0000
I reckon if I had to do it again, I would do Harmonia FRM as a first expansion, does not require much storage neither much shipping volume, cheap and fast ROI

the only thing is DDT which is fairly expensive as well to get in


[01-Apr-25 10:27 PM] smangy.#0000
Yeah planning out ISA the RoI is not great


[01-Apr-25 10:40 PM] pagy1234#0000
it doesnt have good planetary conditions, atmospheric pressure is very high, and teperatures are very low, so you need to buy a certain amount of HSE and INS for each building, which increases the costs by alot

ISA is a bit rough as well on shipping, H2O is very demanding


[01-Apr-25 10:56 PM] smangy.#0000
After planning it out i see it would be nearly daily shipping with the starter ships

thanks :D


[02-Apr-25 04:48 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
The good news is that there tend to be reasonable local market contracts all the time there at close to CX bid price (and probably a decent deal if you are therefore saved the shipping cost).

And, the shipping burden is less once you get your first PSK done.  (But, I wouldn't recommend a new player go there until they have shipping at least plausibly available).


[03-Apr-25 06:31 AM] magican1980#0000
Then I would recommend to consider Etherwind - no extra money for INS/HSE :). But if you only use Farms the H2O you use is "neglicable" and you can buy at the Antares CX


[03-Apr-25 06:41 AM] tanda#0000
the shipping costs a lot more from etherwind or boucher, though


[03-Apr-25 06:41 AM] tanda#0000
so it's not free money to just go to BEN or HRT


[03-Apr-25 02:03 PM] smangy.#0000
After planning out those water options and better understanding the shipping required I honestly think I don't want to do water anymore lol

2nd place too


[03-Apr-25 02:06 PM] laaxus#0000
no need to compete

If you can sfford to process it in situ or you have bigger ships it's not bad


[03-Apr-25 02:16 PM] jcheung#0000
But it's a bit of an upfront investment

also some people are actively trading it, buy/sell imo prices is kept low artificially there too


[03-Apr-25 03:26 PM] vanarazor#0000
interstellar gaia and ftori are the most active traders I see on evey order book


[03-Apr-25 06:58 PM] smangy.#0000
I noticed this as well.


[03-Apr-25 07:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No there is simply just more supply than demand


[03-Apr-25 07:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If there was more people using C then the price would go up


[03-Apr-25 07:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like 9 months ago C was like 500/u but then like there was a shortage so the price went up for C


[03-Apr-25 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But like at least you have buy orders to sell into as a newbie to get some quick cash. The spread really isn’t that bad so like it’s not like it’s nefarious or anything

RIGs on harmonia are worse than using that space for another FRM


[04-Apr-25 11:22 AM] jvaler#0000
the export volume of agri will always be > the import volume of water, so it adds no logistical cost to remove the RIGs for profit optimization


[04-Apr-25 11:22 AM] jvaler#0000
everything else looks good though, you want the grant?


[04-Apr-25 11:24 AM] kk100762#0000

will the weight of the cargo increase fuel consumption？


[04-Apr-25 11:25 AM] jvaler#0000
for STL flight yes, for FTL flight no


[04-Apr-25 11:26 AM] jvaler#0000
it only makes a noticable difference once you start getting into the 1000's of tons of shipping though

thank🙏


[04-Apr-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
depending on how often you think you're going to visit, it may not be a terrible idea to swap the harmonia STO for a RIG and hb1


[04-Apr-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
later on when you drop back to 1 permit then 13 frm and a rig should be very doable


[04-Apr-25 01:34 PM] jcheung#0000
if you use rig though, make sure you make use of the warehouse for extra storage


[04-Apr-25 01:36 PM] jcheung#0000
i also strongly suggest using the fast recipe for BEA and GRN when you can afford it


[04-Apr-25 01:36 PM] jcheung#0000
3 bea : 3 grn : 1 nut


[04-Apr-25 01:38 PM] jcheung#0000
17% increase in output


[04-Apr-25 01:38 PM] jcheung#0000
sure it costs 4x the water but the output boost covers that


[04-Apr-25 01:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't even consider water costs in FRMs it's so neglible lol

[04-Apr-25 01:39 PM] jcheung#0000
also helps some with the FP planet having empty space


[04-Apr-25 01:39 PM] jcheung#0000
since that extra 17% allows you to almost feed another 3 FPs


[04-Apr-25 01:40 PM] laaxus#0000
H2O is so cheap


[04-Apr-25 01:40 PM] jcheung#0000
i would also just simply fill the rest of the planet with FPs, you can easily fill the others with DW or you can slip some HER into the FRM and make some FIM


[04-Apr-25 01:41 PM] jcheung#0000
oh wait. fp has no expert and harmonia doesn't have all experts...


[04-Apr-25 01:41 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, only 2 extra FPs worth


[04-Apr-25 01:42 PM] jcheung#0000
but still, same buildings on harmonia and feeding 2 extra FPs on norwick is good

My experience... and I've been here a while. 
Yes - a lot of channels, one of the first things I did when joining was to mute at least half of them, maybe more.

This leads to myself actually missing a lot of information and actually missing new projects that have been discussed, that I might have joined in on (Thats all my bad)

Hi! 
Does anyone have any tips on what to use My AL for?
I have production of about 200/day
Currently selling it all, but thinking about maybe construkting another base and maybe use it :) 
Anyone got any tips?


[05-Apr-25 02:02 AM] laaxus#0000
use MAT AL to see what the AL is used for


[05-Apr-25 02:02 AM] vanarazor#0000
click on buffer MAT AL = > uses


[05-Apr-25 02:03 AM] jcheung#0000
construction is common


[05-Apr-25 02:03 AM] laaxus#0000
200 AL per day is a little bit less (25% ?) than the consumption of a PP2 base

[05-Apr-25 02:05 AM] vanarazor#0000
If I had 200AL/s I would probably go for a PP2 base on Nike junior : ZV-194b

[05-Apr-25 02:06 AM] vanarazor#0000
but best to compare all the different bases you can do with an AL production and look for profit and cost of such a base


[05-Apr-25 02:06 AM] jcheung#0000
why not nike itself?


[05-Apr-25 02:07 AM] vanarazor#0000
IMO Nike would be best suited for pp3-pp4


[05-Apr-25 02:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It’s not like it’s hard to swap to that later


[05-Apr-25 02:08 AM] jcheung#0000
nike itself offers a better warehouse, which can be helpful when starting out


[05-Apr-25 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
nike jr is actually a ways farther along than i remember it 😅 i take back my comment


[05-Apr-25 02:10 AM] vanarazor#0000
if I had a pp2 base on Nike jr, I 'd go for a pp3 pp4 on Nike later on no need for a swap


[05-Apr-25 02:11 AM] jcheung#0000
i think this is the POPI i remember seeing, which.... i guess i haven't looked in a long time

a base is not set in stone


[05-Apr-25 02:13 AM] laaxus#0000
PP3 is not needed there's an overproduction atm


[05-Apr-25 02:13 AM] laaxus#0000
and PP4 ... well he can wait a year


[05-Apr-25 02:13 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, there's not a huge downside right now though


[05-Apr-25 02:14 AM] jcheung#0000
meanwhile, me considering placing some more PP3's


[05-Apr-25 02:17 AM] laaxus#0000
as long as you know you'll consumme them, its ok


[05-Apr-25 02:17 AM] laaxus#0000

I'm seeing good margins on most of the Rfabs at the moment. I also think that Afabs (and by extension Rfabs) have virtually unlimited demand due to late game HQ upgrade costs.

best one could be  maybe the # of transaction per day ? but it wouldn't take account of the size of said transaction


[05-Apr-25 02:27 AM] laaxus#0000
and daily/weekly sales are not comparable between mats


[05-Apr-25 02:29 AM] evov#0000
People can use whatever metrics they want... but for me, I look at weekly global trade on the CX, vs global CX supply.

It's one of the main indicators I use if I'm looking at markets that are stressed.
Less than 1 week supply on the CX = indicator of coming shortages.

Most of the Rfabs are floating around the 2 week area.. which feels pretty normal from where I'm sitting.


[05-Apr-25 02:31 AM] aromis#0000
How do you look att weekly CX  ?


[05-Apr-25 02:33 AM] evov#0000
MEA - as an example of a stressed market - 7 day trade of 14k ish. Supply of 8k ish.

[05-Apr-25 02:36 AM] jcheung#0000
looking at 7 day lead on mea, only around 20k is being produced a week by top 25


[05-Apr-25 02:37 AM] jcheung#0000
and i doubt half of that sees the market since i recognize a few people with IDC bases (myself included)


[05-Apr-25 02:40 AM] evov#0000
Yea, unfortunately when looking at CX markets, I can really only consider orders posted / public trade. Using your MEA example - where a good amount of production doesn't make it to the market.... the same is true for stock held. For example, I have more MEA in my warehouse than is currently available on the ANT CX.


[05-Apr-25 02:41 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah

let me know, the supporter pack codes are no good to anybody if nobody wants them


[07-Apr-25 08:45 PM] harucyber#0000
what is a supporter pack?


[07-Apr-25 08:46 PM] harucyber#0000
I have a week from a deal I'm doing with a transport agency


[07-Apr-25 08:46 PM] harucyber#0000
but thats it


[07-Apr-25 08:48 PM] tanda#0000
a supporter pack is a set amount of money that is a bit pricier than normal sub time, but comes with some additional perks, like naming a planet

They're a little worse than gifts. You can only claim one ever, and they roll you back to FREE

[07-Apr-25 09:31 PM] harucyber#0000
from what i can tell, not too much difference in PRO vs Basic


[07-Apr-25 09:31 PM] harucyber#0000
other than like more ships and bases


[07-Apr-25 09:32 PM] jvaler#0000
for a sizeable player the first biggest difference is no recurring orders


[07-Apr-25 09:32 PM] harucyber#0000
what does that mean?


[07-Apr-25 09:33 PM] jvaler#0000
you have to manually queue every production order


[07-Apr-25 09:33 PM] jvaler#0000
and if you forget you waste money on lost production time


[07-Apr-25 09:35 PM] harucyber#0000
oh thats not a big deal


[07-Apr-25 09:35 PM] harucyber#0000
other than QOL, are there any limitations for basic compared to pro?


[07-Apr-25 09:38 PM] tanda#0000
without recurring orders, you're probably going to dislike going over more than about 6 bases


[07-Apr-25 09:39 PM] tanda#0000
past that: Basic can only fly 2 ships, cannot upgrade ships, cannot build ships, cannot send contracts but only accept them


[07-Apr-25 09:40 PM] harucyber#0000
honestly thats good enough for what im doing


[07-Apr-25 09:40 PM] harucyber#0000
even if we have more than 2 ships we can't fly with basic?


[07-Apr-25 09:40 PM] harucyber#0000
darns


[07-Apr-25 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's probably the biggest restriction, imo


[07-Apr-25 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
you can juggle orders all you like, but logistics will not be denied


[07-Apr-25 09:43 PM] harucyber#0000
logistics is kinda cooked


[07-Apr-25 09:43 PM] harucyber#0000
but thats part of the fun ig


[07-Apr-25 09:44 PM] harucyber#0000
for me its literally just one ship, the other one is around the galaxy somehwere doing shipments


[07-Apr-25 09:44 PM] harucyber#0000
i have one ship on Harmonia rn doing my supply runs and stuff, but then I have another ship doing random runs in Benton and Hortus 😂

whats why i would hire transporters ig lol


[07-Apr-25 10:19 PM] jcheung#0000
they're better than gifts. gifts also send you back to free iirc


[07-Apr-25 11:28 PM] evany.#0000
i thought you were wrong, but actually i think your right. the key is just a straight 1 month pro subscription, so i think you do revert back to basic - but its not entirely clear about that.


[07-Apr-25 11:40 PM] harucyber#0000
it reverts to BASIC or FREE


[07-Apr-25 11:40 PM] harucyber#0000
i thought it was to FREE reverts to?


[07-Apr-25 11:42 PM] realharvey#0000
Everything that you didn't pay yourself will revert you to free


[07-Apr-25 11:48 PM] evany.#0000
i _feel_ like harvey is right, but the way it reads to me on https://prosperousuniverse.com/perks/codes suggests to me that jcheung is right


[07-Apr-25 11:49 PM] evany.#0000
truth be told, i at least don't know. i already was pro before i used a key so, who knows.


[07-Apr-25 11:49 PM] evany.#0000

gifts and codes revert to free

[07-Apr-25 11:56 PM] evany.#0000
the way i read jcheung is gifts set you back to free but codes go to basic

im pretty sure it was free as well

The 1 mil grant sounds like a lot of free money, but in the great scheme of things, it isn’t really.
I changes the trajectory for new players by 3-6 months, but is for the most mid- to endgame players just there daily profit (or even less)
I would most warmly recommend to apply for one, because this game is stupidly slow. You’ll have your first base financed and a first stable income, which allows you to actually play the game and not just wait 3 months for productions to complete.

Toss out the PrunPlanner build and what your longer term aspirations are.

Just realized that could be misconstrued -- I meant post 'em here, not trash them. =p


[08-Apr-25 12:57 PM] wiseor#0000
That's the problem, I'm not yet sure what the long term plan is. The field is vastly different from the last time i played


[08-Apr-25 12:58 PM] potaterror#0000
Well, if your immediate plan is a solid one it'll probably give you a good foundation to pivot off of to most anything anyway.


[08-Apr-25 12:58 PM] potaterror#0000
Even if it isn't ultimately related.


[08-Apr-25 01:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, thats a good point, you can generally do anything profitable early on, and very easily rotate to something that you actually look towards doing later on, when you have some moeny


[08-Apr-25 01:00 PM] potaterror#0000
The long term bit was mostly to attempt to solicit options that might work better rather than solely weighing a base on its own merits.


[08-Apr-25 01:00 PM] wiseor#0000
My initial plan is to go full RAT, seeing how empty it is on the CX and has been for a while


[08-Apr-25 01:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
Like I wanna make my own ships, so I started out bottling water and selling rations, but now im on my way to start making all sorts of plastics to lead myself into ship parts :D

It's what worked the last time but then i was on Promitor


[08-Apr-25 01:02 PM] wiseor#0000

[08-Apr-25 01:02 PM] pagy1234#0000
what planet are you on?


[08-Apr-25 01:02 PM] wiseor#0000
Harmonia atm


[08-Apr-25 01:02 PM] potaterror#0000
RATs are a rough place to be, the MM will ultimately cap your profits. On the other hand, a farm base can swap to HER once you've got the bankroll for DDT.


[08-Apr-25 01:02 PM] wiseor#0000
My start wasn't ideal but I didn't want to start at Promitor again, wanted another sector 😄


[08-Apr-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
harmonia is good, you can easily start out farming anything you want, then move to RAT and then FIM later


[08-Apr-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
Norwick is a perfect spot for a FP base


[08-Apr-25 01:03 PM] pagy1234#0000
and its pretty close to harmonia


[08-Apr-25 01:03 PM] wiseor#0000
Ye, RAT at ANT right now seems doable for a solid foundation


[08-Apr-25 01:04 PM] wiseor#0000
Ye, that was my plan when i max Harmonia out, move the FP's


[08-Apr-25 01:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
its guaranteed consistent profit, but the MM limits how good it actually would get


[08-Apr-25 01:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
the profits are good to start, but RAT especially should be something you vertically integrate, or repurpose the bases of later to make the real money


[08-Apr-25 01:05 PM] wiseor#0000
Yep. That part I need to figure out tho 😄


[08-Apr-25 01:06 PM] wiseor#0000
About two years ago I would do RAT/DW for some governors so they didn't need to think about it, eventually had enough to build a planetary admin on a planet and become a governor 😄

sadly there is no cheese in this game yet!!! get your head around prplanner, it 's  a useful tool that you are going to consult quite often. Set up a base plan that would require some funds (roughly about a mil)

I did apply for a grant when I started almost 2 months ago but slightly reduced the plan to keep some cash to buy consumables. The idea that I have of the game at start was not entirely "optimised" for profits, but now I understand that your goal is to make as much profits as you can plan while having some fun in your projects.

I try to maximize profits where I can, even after a few bases the game is still quite slow, try to find your fun


[08-Apr-25 11:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That was two months ago 🧐😅

[09-Apr-25 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
So your plan for ZV-759e - it requires both HSE and INS, so it will be fairly expensive. What's the cost of that base?


[09-Apr-25 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also make sure to assign some experts, it will change the balance a bit of mats.


[09-Apr-25 11:07 AM] whitefox8#0000
`18:00` it was 960K now it is 1,5 Million .... Well that is very annoying


[09-Apr-25 11:08 AM] whitefox8#0000
I might have changed something...


[09-Apr-25 11:08 AM] whitefox8#0000
but I dont know what


[09-Apr-25 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah HSE is expensive no matter what. Prices do fluctuate but not generalyl that much. And it depends a bit on what price configuration you have. PP7 should be more stable, put opinions vary on that.


[09-Apr-25 11:09 AM] whitefox8#0000
I wanted to build a base for BDE, LTA and the other resources that are needed for bases and maybe also fuel. But that seems to be to expensive, even for 1 Million.


[09-Apr-25 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Overall the base is a pretty unconventional design, but I am cool funding it. The one REF is the only thing getting the COGC bonus, but I see what you are doing with the glass and BTA/LTA. And it ends up being pretty low shipping


[09-Apr-25 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
What is the ROI that prunplanner is reporting for that base?


[09-Apr-25 11:11 AM] whitefox8#0000
I mean maybe I can do at first more in the way of producing fuel and when I have anoth money I could build the BDE, LTA and the other stuff?


[09-Apr-25 11:11 AM] jab.sh#0000
I'd probably ditch the PP2 and GF and focus on SF


[09-Apr-25 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah.


[09-Apr-25 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
And Deimos is much cheaper to build on- you will get better returns filling out the deimos base first


[09-Apr-25 11:11 AM] whitefox8#0000
130d


[09-Apr-25 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
especially if you can match the COGC on Deimos


[09-Apr-25 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah you really want to aim for an ROI closer to 15-20 days


[09-Apr-25 11:12 AM] whitefox8#0000
what does this mean?


[09-Apr-25 11:12 AM] whitefox8#0000
ROI


[09-Apr-25 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
unfortunately the shared bases feature doesn't show the costs / ROI


[09-Apr-25 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
Return on investment-


[09-Apr-25 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
it's the point where you've made back the money you spent to build the base


[09-Apr-25 11:13 AM] jab.sh#0000
do you know if prunplanner ROI accounts for repairs?


[09-Apr-25 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000

Ok, so I will build a new base for 759-e, give me a moment

[09-Apr-25 11:16 AM] jab.sh#0000
is there enough HCP for that? 😄


[09-Apr-25 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's an example 😛


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] jab.sh#0000
200/day but there's 8k on the market 🤔


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
So that's a full base of INCs as an example. It has full experts and COGC match, so everything coming out of the base is 160% efficiency. The base costs. It costs 963,449.52 to build, makes 55k per day.. so in 17 days you've made back the cost.


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Don't build exactly that, cause it is a lot of shipping


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
But that's probably the kind of numbers you are looking for


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] whitefox8#0000
the more buildings I take away the longer the ROI gets. I think this will not work


[09-Apr-25 11:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
on any base that isnt a farm, you should aim for at least 60k/d profit, and if the base is more expensive, closer, or past 100k.d is better. of course you need to make sure that your ROI is less than 20-30 days, below 15d is. a very strong base


[09-Apr-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
that means that what you are trying to produce there is not profitable


[09-Apr-25 11:19 AM] whitefox8#0000
Is there a button to tell Prunplanner that I have this buildings already?


[09-Apr-25 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
759-e will have really high costs no matter what. You will have better luck with your first few bases on "triple green" planets- ones that don't require extra building materials for an extreme environment


[09-Apr-25 11:19 AM] whitefox8#0000
so that it is not counting tjem into ROI


[09-Apr-25 11:20 AM] whitefox8#0000
but hte most I was seeing where not having the right resources.


[09-Apr-25 11:20 AM] pagy1234#0000
It is a very bad Idea to extract GAL, H, SIO or AMM on that planet...

They still count into the ROI- you can remove them from the construction cart when calculating that cost. But even if they are already built, they still have repair costs

thats fine, you can always buy things from CX


[09-Apr-25 11:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
or you can set up more than one base and extract from high yield planets


[09-Apr-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, especially for things like Oxygen for smelters, etc... it will be cheaper to buy them on the CX from someone who has a full oxygen extracting setup than to try to eek it out very inefficiently yourself

I should probably have some bases that aren't in a co-op, I've been trying to think about what I want to do


[09-Apr-25 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Farms (on Harmonia) are a good starter option. On Deimos SMEs are good, although you will want to check your income closely because sometimes metals have tight margins.  Drinking water is pretty reliable.


[09-Apr-25 11:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
@whitefox8 just for your future reference, you will almost never find a planet that has the perfect materials for your needs, you may have to split up extraction across seperate planets, or just buy the materials on CX.


[09-Apr-25 11:25 AM] jab.sh#0000
I might do something like this (but spread across planets) and make MEA for myself, and sell excess MTP to AA

The other thing I have recommended to new players looking for their second base is manufacturing on Heph. There's a ton of profitable items in this list. The main thing to look for is: make sure whatever you are making is something that sells quickly. Or line up a buyer ahead of time

[09-Apr-25 11:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
But a full base (20 BMPs) on Heph costs 940k and can make that back in a week. Just really check the recipe to see how fast the items sell and how available the mats are. 

PE will be something you can always sell fast and that's got decent returns.

Construction costs are around 300K


[09-Apr-25 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think that's a lot better. So for that one my question becomes.. does the 14.65d ROI become better or worse if you remove the RIGs?


[09-Apr-25 11:38 AM] jab.sh#0000
looks like you could use more RIGs anyway, since you have a water deficit


[09-Apr-25 11:38 AM] whitefox8#0000
(better)


[09-Apr-25 11:38 AM] jab.sh#0000
but yeah play with the numbers a bit


[09-Apr-25 11:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
So it becomes better because the RIGs on other planets are so good that it's cheaper to ship in water at the CX price than to extract your own. That's probably also true for the COL


[09-Apr-25 11:38 AM] whitefox8#0000
but worse if I take the FP away


[09-Apr-25 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah DW is so profitable it helps even if it doesn't match the COGC


[09-Apr-25 11:39 AM] whitefox8#0000
COL = yes


[09-Apr-25 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Deimos is pretty good for ALO extraction, so those EXT doing aluminum ore are probably good


[09-Apr-25 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you overproduce ore you can prpobably sell it locally and save on shipping

💯 

[09-Apr-25 11:40 AM] whitefox8#0000
so currently I am at ROI 13.65


[09-Apr-25 11:40 AM] whitefox8#0000
and 71K Profit per day.


[09-Apr-25 11:40 AM] whitefox8#0000
no RIGs and no COLs


[09-Apr-25 11:41 AM] whitefox8#0000
I was even having the Idea **(long term)** to only extract the resources from the planet and then build/smelt the resources on a better planet.

[09-Apr-25 11:42 AM] jab.sh#0000
Deimos is great for both, but yeah you could get more profit by splitting it, since you can have bigger bases.

so, is this plan now good? Or should I make that better by any chance?


[09-Apr-25 11:43 AM] pagy1234#0000

Nice thing about FRMs is that if you scale that back to one permit to spend that 2nd permit on another planet once you have more shipping, you're not going to lose a ton in unsalvageable mats.

if you do 2 DW and 3 RAT it makes your excess H2O fall to 8, so you don't need to export water.


[09-Apr-25 12:08 PM] jab.sh#0000
not sure what that does to your ROI though


[09-Apr-25 12:09 PM] potaterror#0000
It's import-heavy anyway, so the water export shouldn't be much of an issue.


[09-Apr-25 12:10 PM] jab.sh#0000
fair point


[09-Apr-25 12:11 PM] jab.sh#0000
do whichever is more profitable 😛


[09-Apr-25 12:11 PM] wiseor#0000
It actually made things better, less water excess, more DW export ofc, little less on RAT but overall solid


[09-Apr-25 12:11 PM] jab.sh#0000
although 2 DW makes import frequency less too


[09-Apr-25 12:11 PM] jcheung#0000
well


[09-Apr-25 12:12 PM] wiseor#0000
well, more DW to sell i mean 🙂


[09-Apr-25 12:12 PM] potaterror#0000
Ends up buffering RAT supplies though, 13/d each or so


[09-Apr-25 12:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
wat


[09-Apr-25 12:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
oh you're looking at both bases

[09-Apr-25 12:12 PM] jab.sh#0000
I only had the etherwind one open


[09-Apr-25 12:13 PM] jab.sh#0000
but you can always sell the excess rat supplies too


[09-Apr-25 12:13 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah 3/1 basically uses all of them, that's nice


[09-Apr-25 12:13 PM] potaterror#0000
It's not a big deal either way, that just means you'll have a stack ready to make RATs when you expand to a FP base.


[09-Apr-25 12:13 PM] jab.sh#0000
also true

[09-Apr-25 12:14 PM] jcheung#0000
i would consider more FPs and less rigs on etherwind, using the PG h2o recipe... to... say, 25 FP 3 RIG
then importing the harmonia water and topping off from cx

How do you boys think I can create a metallurgy company with the agp?


[09-Apr-25 10:46 PM] vanarazor#0000
I'd say start on Deimos and start melting AL..  however  smelting ores requires quite a sturdy shipping power.. and apparentlly selling AL does not get you much profit at the moment so actually may be not but that's up to you 

You could also use this map and look for a metallurgy COGC (Chamber of global commerce) planet  :https://universemap.duckdns.org/. close to your first base would probably be advised.. but up to you. If you could find a planet with the right conditions to enable a cheaper settlement (we call them tripple green: that is **rocky** and not** gazeous**, with the right **temperature** that is not too **cold** nor too **hot **, with **gravity** somewhat liveable without extra survival equipement)

I'd add that precious find (_planet name_ ) in prplaner and  tick the box : 'Match COGC' to only see the metallugistic buildings, and try out what makes profits under which circumstances.

if you choose to follow this route, I wish you a _happy hunting_

once you found an interesting plan, publish it here, some Nanti and mecene would look at it


[09-Apr-25 10:51 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Ok will do. I like it. I'd assume AL doesnt do well. What metals would? Or is it simply an ROI game here?


[09-Apr-25 11:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
AL sells the fastest. Metals like LI and CU might look profitable but they won't sell very quickly, so I recommend against them. Deimos is well suited for AL, just check the ROI in prunplanner. Fluctuations in the AL price and the C price are mostly what will affect profitability there


[09-Apr-25 11:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a second base you can use the AL in a constuction base, and that is a pretty reliable way to turn AL into something pretty valuable.


[09-Apr-25 11:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like this is... mediocre. 17d isn't awwwwwful. There's certainly a lot worse

[09-Apr-25 11:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
STL (steel) does a little better and I think that would sell with only a little more risk than AL.


[09-Apr-25 11:12 PM] .shiva.#0000
FE is a little rough with starters


[09-Apr-25 11:13 PM] .shiva.#0000

Uuh, boy - welcome to my turf! 
I’m focusing on extracting ore and smelting metals, so I can tell you a thing or two 🤠

A few things you need to know, when going this route:
- ores and metals are extremely heavy, which means you need a lot more ships to transport them (which are expensive)
- ores and metal smelting are low tier products (pioneers) and often the beginning of a production line. People won’t pay too much for it, means your profits will be lower.
- except AL and FE, metal markets are slow. You’ll sit on your stock. Especially in the beginning, where you don’t have much other income sources, this can be hard.
- metals are going mostly into ship building. Exceptions are AL and FE and STL, which are also used for construction prefabs. Most shipbuilders have already established resource pipelines or don’t need much of the materials. 

Regards the individual metals:
- AL is relatively beginner-friendly. It’s easy to transport and is consumed in good quantities by the region, so markets move overall pretty fast. But since we lost a major ship building player last month, the AL market is oversaturated and won’t make much bucks. This condition might stay for a bit.
- FE/STL for most metallurgist the obvious next step. STL has a good price atm and is in good demand, after we increased RFAB production lately. You can relatively easy produce FE and STL on Vulcan.
- CU and AU are very heavy and slow moving markets. Also, as far as I can see, the market is at an equilibrium atm

I don’t produce and sell the other metals (LI/SI), so I can’t tell you for sure how they are, but probably are similar to CU and AU.

Overall, if you want to go that route, start with high-profit-low-shipping industries, like farming and chemistry. Build up a few bases, so you have a good and stable income.
After that, you should have some capital to finance the ships you need to transport all the rocks.

👆🏽 ❤️ 🍉 🌈 👍 

[10-Apr-25 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
IMHO, after going that route, I think metallurgist is more of a mid-game profession. Except AL, all the metal markets aren’t beginner-friendly.


[10-Apr-25 01:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Especially in the beginning, lower ROI are favourable, because they define more or less the growth of your company. 
This game is overall really slow, so getting into the midgame as fast as possible is part of why we have the AGP 😅


[10-Apr-25 01:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000
SI is super cheap for what is needed to produce it


[10-Apr-25 01:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000
None of the SI recipes are really great


[10-Apr-25 10:16 AM] evany.#0000
^he gets to say that because we had just spent an hour ranting about how useless SI is

[10-Apr-25 11:15 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
I see what youre saying. What if I did a split of the AGP where I spend half on AL and the other half on conrstuction of a stable income like farming.


[10-Apr-25 11:16 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Games like this are literally my ideal type of game.


[10-Apr-25 11:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That might be an option. I feel like you're money would be better invested in a full farming or chem base, but I'm not to judge

I'll listen to you. You understand it more. What constitutes a chem base? What are the requirements?

If you click on the building of a recipe, you see it's expertise

any building with an "Chemistry" expertise falls into that category

[10-Apr-25 11:20 AM] jcheung#0000
Just to familiarize yourself


[10-Apr-25 11:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
it is recommended to build production lines on a planet with a COGC program of there expertise, to be most efficient


[10-Apr-25 11:21 AM] jcheung#0000
Unless you meant both lines on the same planet


[10-Apr-25 11:21 AM] jcheung#0000
In which case for cogc reasons, that's not ideal

[10-Apr-25 11:25 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Most players (including me) will tell you, that it's an essential tool for base planning. To get a grant accepted for example you'll need to post a PrunPlanner plan here in chat, so people can review it. It also helps to play around with diffrent base configurations to get a feeling for what's good and what's not


[10-Apr-25 11:26 AM] pxlfox.#0000
There is probably a link to a tutorial video somewhere here in chat, if you want to find more about how to use it.

The two questions I have is why 2 permits and why Vault?


[10-Apr-25 02:49 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Im not sure why not 2 and why not vault?


[10-Apr-25 02:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Why not two is permits get really expensive and adding permits to a base only adds 250 space while a new base gives 500 space

Griffonstone would be the best option in ANT


[10-Apr-25 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's just a few jumps out, but it's a triple green planet also, and it has a good population of workers for this base


[10-Apr-25 02:54 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Ok cool. Do I extract HAL too?


[10-Apr-25 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
The starter ships actually can't make it to vault I think- not enough fuel.

[10-Apr-25 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think extracting some HAL would be very viable.

[10-Apr-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
WIthout any extractors the base requires 414t of imports a day, which is nearly a full starter ship per day. 360t of that is HAL, so you can really cut down on shipping by extracting it there


[10-Apr-25 02:57 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000

there is a slight worker shortage since you added another CHP and EXT

I see.


[10-Apr-25 03:09 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
10-5 will do then reload.


[10-Apr-25 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can achieve it with 8 HBB, 1 HB2, 11 CHP, 6 EXT


[10-Apr-25 03:10 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Nice!


[10-Apr-25 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
or you can do the 5 HB1, 6 HB2, 10 CHP, 5 EXT like you have there, and that's probably best. You can use the extra 48 area for something later, or for a STO (which is extra storage on the base)


[10-Apr-25 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
The HBBs cost a little more than HB1 and HB2, so 🤷‍♂️

Buy the parts and build them


[10-Apr-25 03:44 PM] archielvahr#0000

We offer kits to upgrade your current starter ships to something more useful here in #psk-operations and you can get a 0 interest loan too info is #psk-information shows the blueprint for the new ship upgrade and loan details


[10-Apr-25 03:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But as an fyi new ships cost 4-6 million


[10-Apr-25 03:45 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Ah hahaha that would be important to know


[10-Apr-25 03:45 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Ok. Ill think about all that later.


[10-Apr-25 03:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The ship upgrade kit is much less


[10-Apr-25 03:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It expands your 500t 500 m3 to 3000t 1000m3


[10-Apr-25 03:48 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Thats a preaty sizable upgrade.


[10-Apr-25 03:49 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Thanks again btw for all the info


[10-Apr-25 03:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000

would AGP grant me 1 mil for my grand SF expansions


[10-Apr-25 05:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Maybe where at?


[10-Apr-25 05:49 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am confused, does AGP have a maximum bases condition?

:RSZeroShrugIDK:

We’ve never really talked about that before I think


[10-Apr-25 05:50 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I am splitting my LS-746b 3x permit SF base to LS-746b, Ant I G, and Ant II E.


[10-Apr-25 05:51 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I also recently moved my ANT II g H base to KI-401d to make more H to support the expansions


[10-Apr-25 05:52 PM] optimizedfunction#0000

I know its a stretch 😅


[10-Apr-25 05:57 PM] jvaler#0000

its the NPC which buys/sells certain commodities at set prices on all CXs


[10-Apr-25 09:01 PM] tanda#0000
I make a ton of niche items that sometimes just sit for weeks before moving in a burst. I need something like EDC for liquidity

[12-Apr-25 11:37 PM] tanda#0000
how are you planning to supply the base with inputs? How much of this is covered by your FRMs already?


[12-Apr-25 11:41 PM] tanda#0000
Agricultural inputs are notoriously thin and expensive to source from the CX past a certain degree of consumption. I see you're using an ALG recipe, which has a lot of supply, but I suggest looking at the CX for the other inputs to see how long you're likely to be able to sustain the base


[12-Apr-25 11:42 PM] tanda#0000
and how long it will remain profitable, given the rising cost as you go through the ASK orders


[12-Apr-25 11:44 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Would it be more profitable to make a FRM base?


[12-Apr-25 11:45 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
And what COGC would that be?


[12-Apr-25 11:45 PM] tanda#0000
It would if you were to focus strictly on HER. Don't get me wrong, this base is a fantastic second base in its supply chain, but it needs a FRM or HYF base to supply it


[12-Apr-25 11:45 PM] tanda#0000
(upgraded ships wouldn't hurt either, Norwick is about 12 hours out)


[12-Apr-25 11:46 PM] tanda#0000
If you were interested in trying something a bit more expensive/risk taking, you might try to negotiate with people who hold bases in SE-110


[12-Apr-25 11:47 PM] tanda#0000
we each seem to run our own supply chains out there and it leads to a lot of agri overflow that we're moving around or dumping into MAI production


[12-Apr-25 11:47 PM] tanda#0000
could be some cheap supply to pick up in that system on SE-110a, if you wanted to run an FP base there


[12-Apr-25 11:48 PM] tanda#0000
otherwise, I would suggest trying to build part of a FRM base and part of an FP base so you can self supply and work on getting those fleshed out after


[12-Apr-25 11:49 PM] evany.#0000
i'm open to the idea

[13-Apr-25 12:08 AM] evany.#0000
regarding the base specifically the reason tanda is concerned is because agri is kind of notoriously bad and is a bit  inconsistent in the market

{Reactions}
👆 👍 

[13-Apr-25 12:09 AM] evany.#0000
so while its a 'good' base, its a bit hit or miss because you are relying on older players (me) to sell you stuff via CX and i might not sell any this month.


[13-Apr-25 12:10 AM] evany.#0000
(obviously not only me, but you get the idea.)

i'm also concerned about your imports (note that a starter ship will need to be out their daily for your import  (311m3/day) with 500m3 max, so 4-5 times a week  and that you didn't put storages on your plan (but there is room)

which, at the start does not rely on importing ALO


[18-Apr-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000
you however don't want to export ALO either so try to have more ALO than necessary, but minimize the overproduction

[18-Apr-25 09:44 AM] laaxus#0000
because of experts and the planet COGC, you want one type of COGC per base


[18-Apr-25 09:45 AM] laaxus#0000
however, AL is mostly used in fabs, which is done with construction building, experts and planets (see "MAT AL" buffer)


[18-Apr-25 09:46 AM] laaxus#0000
construction not metalurgy, mb mb


[18-Apr-25 09:46 AM] bishopsix#0000
oooh so I can't go further with, for example, building from AL due to the COGC base type?


[18-Apr-25 09:46 AM] bishopsix#0000
on the same planet


[18-Apr-25 09:47 AM] bishopsix#0000
or rather manufacturing from AL something


[18-Apr-25 09:47 AM] laaxus#0000
that's right, it'd be better to only produce AL on deimos, and then consume that AL on a construction planet like nike or aceland if you want to go that path


[18-Apr-25 09:47 AM] bishopsix#0000
huh interesting!


[18-Apr-25 09:47 AM] bishopsix#0000
thanks Laaxus, I will do the full 500 with AL then, actually this makes it easier


[18-Apr-25 09:47 AM] laaxus#0000
all of that is taken into account by prunplanner


[18-Apr-25 09:48 AM] laaxus#0000
so you can just try to maximize profit

how many days of production do you think you can store ?


[18-Apr-25 10:23 AM] bishopsix#0000
now that you say that, 2.9, so I have 1500 base space + 500x2 from my ships, i would need 1.29 days for export until full and 3.83 imports to sustain my pops


[18-Apr-25 10:23 AM] bishopsix#0000
actually, possibly less than that bc my storage contains basic foods and stuff


[18-Apr-25 10:24 AM] bishopsix#0000

to increase storage


[18-Apr-25 10:29 AM] bishopsix#0000
I am literally blind I didnt see STO there


[18-Apr-25 10:29 AM] bishopsix#0000
I thought only permits increased sto size 😢

Looking to apply for the AGP for developing a construction base in Nike. Based on feedback I'm considering PP1/PP2 (https://prunplanner.org/shared/99aa6cbc-87a6-4094-b808-59e3bfffd71d) or PP2/PP3 (https://prunplanner.org/shared/7eade9cf-3ad9-428a-b28d-dcb6c6746f4b). The former being easier to get up and running quickly but the latter being more profitable (though significantly more expensive to construct. Given that I'm new, I don't have enough experience to know whether the upcoming changes would pose a greater risk to the potential profitability of either particular build moreso than the other.

[19-Apr-25 04:19 PM] jcheung#0000
fortunately there's not a ton of risk right now for either base


[19-Apr-25 04:21 PM] .shiva.#0000
Imo pp1s aren't amazing, so I'd lean the other way myself


[19-Apr-25 04:22 PM] jcheung#0000
they do one thing okay, and that's about it


[19-Apr-25 04:38 PM] harkenn#0000
The primary challenge with the pp2/pp3 setup is that it is significantly more expensive to build and operate, so I would be operating at significantly lower profit per day, for at least the first month or two


[19-Apr-25 04:43 PM] jcheung#0000
so there's another option


[19-Apr-25 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
you can build out the PP1/PP2 base first, then at the 60 day repair point you can decommission your PP1's and build PP3's


[19-Apr-25 04:46 PM] jcheung#0000
or at 30/45/90 points


[19-Apr-25 04:47 PM] jcheung#0000
but 60 will be the most cost efficient for that base


[19-Apr-25 05:53 PM] harkenn#0000
That sounds like a pragmatic balance between the two


[19-Apr-25 06:15 PM] jcheung#0000
i suppose i should explain what i mean by 60 day repair point


[19-Apr-25 06:16 PM] jcheung#0000
basically every 15 ish days you can expect the cost of repair to spike up, and the repair cost is the difference between the building refund cost and the cost to build the structure


[19-Apr-25 06:16 PM] jcheung#0000
so if you wait til one of the repair points your cost is minimal for the production buildings (outta luck for housing though)


[19-Apr-25 06:18 PM] harkenn#0000
So repairing on the 14th/15th day is optimal? or on the 29th/30th day?


[19-Apr-25 06:18 PM] tanda#0000
generally anywhere from 45 to 90 days


[19-Apr-25 06:19 PM] tanda#0000
30 days is far too often unless it's a mission critical base


[19-Apr-25 06:19 PM] harkenn#0000
Ok so its not a linear progression then


[19-Apr-25 06:20 PM] tanda#0000
no, if you want to see a good example of this, go on prun planner and open the "repair" section on the side


[19-Apr-25 06:21 PM] tanda#0000
it's has steps like stairs on it


[19-Apr-25 06:21 PM] tanda#0000
the best day to repair is when the cost of the repair gets offset by the money you lose in lost productivity if you don't

This spreadsheet explains it better than I can, I recommend giving it a read


[19-Apr-25 06:23 PM] jcheung#0000
prunplanner also has a repair thing that shows the spikes as well


[19-Apr-25 06:24 PM] jcheung#0000
that said, neither prunplanner nor the repair guide take into account reduced production speed from degradation so when you get past 90 days it gets really bad really fast


[19-Apr-25 06:25 PM] tanda#0000
actually, the repair guide does simulate that


[19-Apr-25 06:25 PM] tanda#0000
but it's a really basic simulation where you just tell it how much money you make from the building in perfect condition


[19-Apr-25 06:25 PM] tanda#0000
Prunplanner doesn't seem to, though


[21-Apr-25 05:08 AM] whitefox8#0000
I got now a big problem because the prices for NL and GL did litterally double when it comes to the costs that where prunplanner telling me (GL: 21,960 $  vs. 42,000 $ and NL: 85,116 $ vs. 141.600 $ daily costs), because of this my production is writing red numbers and I cant produce really. The prices for the produced products are staying still. Any advice what I can do?

[21-Apr-25 11:45 AM] harkenn#0000
lol, sounds reasonable. So from the back and forth over the weekend above, I think the plan that seems most pragmatic to me was this (https://prunplanner.org/shared/99aa6cbc-87a6-4094-b808-59e3bfffd71d) PP1 / PP2 setup up to the 60 day repair point and then decommissioning the PP1 side and shifting the base towards PP2/PP3 (https://prunplanner.org/shared/7eade9cf-3ad9-428a-b28d-dcb6c6746f4b)


[21-Apr-25 11:46 AM] pagy1234#0000

[21-Apr-25 11:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
not sure how the cash flow would look like, im not super well versed with FAB production for im prolly not the best for this, but overall the inputs look very expensive, and although the output is even more expensive it might be challenge to get it all going


[21-Apr-25 11:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
can you show me a screen shot of this area (its not possible for otherpeople to see this part on shared plans):

[21-Apr-25 11:51 AM] harkenn#0000
And actually, I have quite a few BBH and BSE which might make it practical to just go straight to the PP2/PP3 base, although the inputs are even more expensive than the PP1/PP2 setup.


[21-Apr-25 11:51 AM] pagy1234#0000

as a starter base im not too sure about this


[21-Apr-25 11:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
are you fixated on construction?


[21-Apr-25 11:53 AM] igfloz#0000

[21-Apr-25 11:53 AM] pagy1234#0000
theres a base I looked at a while ago that looks really strong currently


[21-Apr-25 11:54 AM] harkenn#0000
@igfloz unfortunately, that's accounted for in the coop. @pagy1234 I liked the sound of construction and enjoyed it initially, before I coliq'd to demios


[21-Apr-25 11:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Did you check shipping on this? Fabs require quite heavy inputs


[21-Apr-25 11:56 AM] igfloz#0000
yeah, thats a fair amount of AL & LST you'll have to buy & haul each week


[21-Apr-25 11:56 AM] igfloz#0000
I mean the plan looks ok - but as a starter - I'm not so sure


[21-Apr-25 11:57 AM] igfloz#0000
I could take a punt and send you the mil - just be aware of the shipping and mat costs


[21-Apr-25 11:58 AM] igfloz#0000
err. isn't LST produced on NIke ? could maybe get a deal on the local market for LST


[21-Apr-25 11:59 AM] igfloz#0000
...and I'd suggest 2 STO (lots of mass required for the AL & LST)


[21-Apr-25 12:05 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah I was trying to eek out as perfect a balance (in terms of maximally utilizing workers) as I could for both factory designs, and unfortunately it required less storage than it seemed was a good idea.


[21-Apr-25 12:06 PM] harkenn#0000
(the PP2 / PP3 doesn't have any, which probably wouldn't be sustainable)


[21-Apr-25 12:07 PM] igfloz#0000
check MAT LST or MAT AL in a new buffer. You'll find for every 100 LST you need 273t of weight available


[21-Apr-25 12:13 PM] harkenn#0000
> I mean the plan looks ok - but as a starter - I'm not so sure

In terms of complexity? Or profitability? or something else entirely?

@pagy1234 I'm also not opposed to looking at other plans, especially if they're more profitable and - thus - something I could use to fuel other bases that are construction-oriented (or construciton-adjacent). Ultimately I'm new enough in the game that while construction sounds interesting / engaging, its not something I'm dead-certain about, especially if there are more appealing options out there.


[21-Apr-25 12:15 PM] igfloz#0000
well, feeding the thing with starter ships might be a challenge you can only carry 180 Al (i think)


[21-Apr-25 12:15 PM] harkenn#0000
I just liked the sound of building the components that ultimately fuel factory building (i.e. expansionism)


[21-Apr-25 12:16 PM] harkenn#0000
@igfloz yep that math checks out; 185 fills up the tonnage of the starter ships


[21-Apr-25 12:17 PM] harkenn#0000
So I'd need to be running both ships, more or less daily, moving mats


[21-Apr-25 12:17 PM] igfloz#0000
yes


[21-Apr-25 12:17 PM] harkenn#0000
Which is fine, I have the time/attention for that. Whether I get tired of it or not, I guess, is  reasonable question, but if the expectation is that its a jumping-off point for bigger ships and other bases, I think that's fine?

on prun planner, use the planet search for Hephaestus, then test some WPL buildings making NL


[21-Apr-25 12:19 PM] pagy1234#0000
no shipping constraints cuz its same system as ANT CX, relatively cheap base, and great ROI


[21-Apr-25 12:20 PM] igfloz#0000
This is probably a better cash generator right now


[21-Apr-25 12:36 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah that looks good. I'm not sure if producing LDEs from NL is actually better, profitability wise, in the long term (as opposed to just selling the NL) but I guess that'll be a problem for me to figure out later on.


[21-Apr-25 12:37 PM] harkenn#0000
The only thing that occurs to me is that nothing else out of the WPL is anywhere near as profitable as NL is....which makes this a little susceptible to either overproduction of NL or a change that reduces NLs demand, no?


[21-Apr-25 12:54 PM] jcheung#0000
if selling NL, i suggest using 5k as the sell number. historically it's been around that, and if it settles to a new higher number then you'll just have a pleasant increase in profit.


[21-Apr-25 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
The price of NL is high because there isn't enough production


[21-Apr-25 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
I put a high bid because I want higher production


[21-Apr-25 12:59 PM] laaxus#0000
With 1000 unit, there's largely enough to get the base back in profit, thrice over


[21-Apr-25 01:56 PM] realharvey#0000
5k is a little very old. 5800-6800 is a reasonable range I think


[21-Apr-25 01:57 PM] laaxus#0000
I believe NL new price will be around 5800 - 6k


[21-Apr-25 01:57 PM] laaxus#0000
might be wrong, let's see


[21-Apr-25 02:13 PM] jcheung#0000
i would be leery of relying on that. last year around this time NL prices had risen to 5-6k, then right after i had gotten NL plants online it crashed to 4k/u for several months


[21-Apr-25 02:13 PM] jcheung#0000
with how high NL prices are, i would expect it to settle in around 5.5k, but i would still use 5k when selling


[21-Apr-25 02:39 PM] jab.sh#0000
so what's the ROI at 5k?


[21-Apr-25 02:40 PM] laaxus#0000

[21-Apr-25 02:47 PM] realharvey#0000
With inflation on almost all products currently I think its gonna be higher. But none of us can really predict the market

@harkenn with my PRO licence coming to an end, one of my goals was to pay -forward an AGP grant.

So I'm just gonna send ya 1mil AIC contract. take the money and terminate the cont 😄 - Have lots of fun and be careful to  keep some cash back for sundries


[21-Apr-25 03:13 PM] getonthetrain#0000
some people don't look at numbers and just dump at market underbidding all the time


[21-Apr-25 03:22 PM] harkenn#0000
@igfloz I appreciate it; my plans for construction had been trepedatiously received each time I've presented them, so I'll hold on those and take maybe 1 more day to solicit ideas for starter base designs; perhaps look around tonight at the precursors to actual construction and see if any of those are profitable (with tolerable shipping volumes, like NL has) as well.


[21-Apr-25 03:23 PM] harkenn#0000
And then perhaps proceed - if no other options present themselves - with NL on heph


[21-Apr-25 03:23 PM] igfloz#0000
cont is already sent - accept whenever you like 😄


[21-Apr-25 03:24 PM] igfloz#0000
oh, there we go - done !

Confirmed (for the purposes of whomever manages the spreadsheet to add me and Igfloz to it)


[21-Apr-25 03:25 PM] harkenn#0000
I wonder if epoxy is profitable to construct....it was an enormous expense on the PP2/PP3 plant


[21-Apr-25 03:26 PM] igfloz#0000
EPO is quite popular to make at the moment - I think there is already a project involving it


[21-Apr-25 03:28 PM] igfloz#0000
....and yeah - R-fabs are not a starting area to work in in my opinion


[21-Apr-25 03:28 PM] harkenn#0000
R-Fabs?


[21-Apr-25 03:28 PM] igfloz#0000
RBH etc


[21-Apr-25 03:29 PM] harkenn#0000
For the same reasons cited above? logistical complexities?


[21-Apr-25 03:29 PM] igfloz#0000
B-fabs, L-fabs, R-fabs etc.


[21-Apr-25 03:30 PM] igfloz#0000
just the expense of buying materials - a lot of people manufacture the ingredients internally


[21-Apr-25 03:30 PM] igfloz#0000
which, in turn leads to multiple planets(bases) required that specialise in required COGC for each ingredient


[21-Apr-25 03:32 PM] igfloz#0000
@jvaler  - just an FYI 🙂


[21-Apr-25 03:33 PM] harkenn#0000
Ohhh, it seems like there are quite a few combinations in manufacturing that are profitable


[21-Apr-25 03:33 PM] harkenn#0000
Oh, 20 BMPs is quite an expensive factory though, lol


[21-Apr-25 03:34 PM] igfloz#0000
indeed, 1 mil gets you "started"


[21-Apr-25 03:34 PM] harkenn#0000
and only PWO is logistically simple enough to manage w/ starter ships


[21-Apr-25 03:36 PM] igfloz#0000
the NL option on Hephaestus is a very valid start right now


[21-Apr-25 03:37 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah I was mostly just looking at other options to diversify, especially if there was uncertainty about what price NL is likely to be settling down to


[21-Apr-25 03:38 PM] igfloz#0000
whatever it settles to - you will still make some profit. I can't see it falling off a cliff yet


[21-Apr-25 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000

I want to build my second base. My first one was for DNPC co-op on deimos. Got some cash from it now and looking at two options to expand in Antares.

I wanted to see if I could get a grant to start personal base, outside of the DNPC co-op.

I've got two minds, and am looking for some feedback.

I was initially excited about making CL on griff, as it seems like good payout
[Griff CL](https://prunplanner.org/shared/9f5ca25b-3af8-49ab-a09f-4f31f19b4eda)

But I saw people mentioned BMP above and that looks possibly better? depending on market conditions, and once I get experts.
[Heph BMP](https://prunplanner.org/shared/9e9f5481-ad3a-4859-888c-ee8167153449)

Anything I'm missing? Are either of these a good idea?

Both need a bit of cash to get going, so I wanted to combine the grant with the cash I have on hand

[22-Apr-25 11:15 AM] realharvey#0000
In case of pp2 there are market shenanigans at play


[22-Apr-25 11:15 AM] evany.#0000
it shows LDE as not profitable because its currently on the CX for about 9k a unit and LDE only sells for 10 which is why it shows that


[22-Apr-25 11:15 AM] realharvey#0000
Normal NL price is between 5500 and 6500


[22-Apr-25 11:15 AM] evany.#0000
there are some things where its not profitable to make - NL is not actually worth the 10k being asked for on the CX


[22-Apr-25 11:17 AM] evany.#0000
if you were buying NL at the ask price though - 6k LDE will be still profitable, but not by much (NL @ 6k + 3*AL @ 2.1k and consumable cost ~say round to like 7500 total cost - the other 1.5 would be your margin - but that ~15% margin ins rather low for a new player your gonna want something abit more healthy (30%+)


[22-Apr-25 11:18 AM] harkenn#0000
@bigtoot I have also noticed (as a new player) that some things that aren't profitable in the planner (but have obvious uses) are part of production chains. I'd be very surprised if anyone selling LDE, for example, isn't producing their own NL (and probably AL too since its even simpler to setup)


[22-Apr-25 11:19 AM] harkenn#0000
That last part is speculation, but is the logical conclusion.


[22-Apr-25 11:19 AM] evany.#0000
is that true? i've never asked about LFABS but i've never heard of people running their own textiles


[22-Apr-25 11:20 AM] evany.#0000
i've always purchased mine for L/R fabs..


[22-Apr-25 11:20 AM] harkenn#0000
I don't know that for fact, I'm very new, but given how much NL cuts into the profitability of LDE, the obvious answer would be to produce your own.

[22-Apr-25 11:21 AM] harkenn#0000
At least at current market prices in Ant, its ~70% more profitable (after accounting for the price of PG) to produce your own NL for LDE


[22-Apr-25 11:22 AM] evany.#0000
for an older player your right, but everytime i've looked at textile planets they have been less than desireable margin wise.

bober isn't the worst for that base just because of CX proximity, but TSH is a little expensive


[28-Apr-25 01:00 PM] jcheung#0000
that said i also offer tsh at 31k/u if you end up needing some

Thoughts?  https://prunplanner.org/shared/b5604d39-c967-4556-b6f5-ea603f8ebd19
see the construction costs to see how much I would actually need;
this is basically just a doubling of my current base

Welcome! It’s always good to see another Harmonia farmer - that’s how I started too 😄

needing a second permit for one area isn't ideal


[01-May-25 09:16 AM] jcheung#0000
you can optimize housing so that you don't need to waste a second permit


[01-May-25 09:16 AM] shipyards#0000
oh actually yeah ill do that

[01-May-25 09:16 AM] shipyards#0000
aight done it fits on one permit now


[01-May-25 09:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
Just a few things to consider. Feel free to ask if any of these terms are unfamiliar:
1. it’s typically more cost effective to buy H2O than to extract it on Harmonia. You make more money having FRMs than you save by having RIGs, if that makes sense
2. You’ll eventually want to move your FP/FER to another planet like Norwick to get the full COGC bonus (which you could use the full grant for, if you’re interested)


[01-May-25 09:17 AM] jcheung#0000
hmmm. i don't particularly like how many industries you have on one planet


[01-May-25 09:18 AM] shipyards#0000
do i buy H20 and ship it? thats a lot of stuff to move


[01-May-25 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
general rule of thumb is 2 industries max, and one should match the COGC

Not really, rigs may be helpful in the beginning but eventually they just aren't as worth it long term.

[01-May-25 09:19 AM] jcheung#0000
so if you drop the rigs entirely, your shipping only goes up to 53t/d


[01-May-25 09:19 AM] jcheung#0000
which is a visit a week


[01-May-25 09:21 AM] shipyards#0000
aight lemme do some planning and I'll be back


[01-May-25 09:21 AM] jvaler#0000
for FRMs, almost always


[01-May-25 09:22 AM] jvaler#0000
they export more agri than the water they consume, so it adds no logistical strain to do so

[01-May-25 09:24 AM] jcheung#0000
i would consider this if you want to broadly keep the same structure.

[01-May-25 09:25 AM] shipyards#0000
lmao thats exactly what I just planned


[01-May-25 09:25 AM] jcheung#0000
though can swap the STO for one RIG if you want, since shipping isn't much


[01-May-25 09:25 AM] jcheung#0000
oh, i also bumped RAT and DW up one


[01-May-25 09:25 AM] loans_13178#0000
This is 100% correct.


[01-May-25 09:27 AM] shipyards#0000

If @jcheung is happy with it, then I’m happy to cover the grant 😄


[01-May-25 09:33 AM] sidepipe#0000
@shipyards you mentioned wanting half the grant earlier. Are you fine with the full 1M?


[01-May-25 09:34 AM] shipyards#0000
I mean I won’t complain


[01-May-25 09:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
(You may not need it all, but you’re entitled to all of it so you might as well take it and use it for something else)


[01-May-25 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
the rest of it can be used for feedstock 😛

500k of feed for harmonia is a lot

That also makes things easier for me because I don’t need to edit the contract on mobile 😄

[01-May-25 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
but you can also use it to start a second base 😂

I’ll check my conts in about 45 minutes I’ve gotta finish Calc test

calc on the complex plane was **not** fun

I thought that was fun personally, but I also don’t remember any of it now. So it must not have been _that_ fun 😄

so are you a rectangular coordinates or polar
