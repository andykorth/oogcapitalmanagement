**Assanova**:	depends on the votes


[25-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Is the consumable need dependent on the bonus type?


[25-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	no it same


[25-Sep-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So, does the first week's PIO bonus not use consumables, or do they mean that the PIO week isn't important anyway?


[25-Sep-21 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	I think what he means is that 1 week of PIO allows us a week to rearrange our bases as we see the votes come in


[25-Sep-21 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	and yes im pretty sure it takes consumbles


[25-Sep-21 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	that, and also we get better numbers on the amounts of consumables needed


[25-Sep-21 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	but eh, I'll use an approximation that will cover the weeks ahead


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so this is a notice to all you SW/RAT/MCG/PE producers to get ready!


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	besides that, we also need to have a discussion on raising taxes to pay for the debt, future popi, and upkeep of the CoGC


[25-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	before I say anything, I'd like to hear all of your thoughts on this matter


[25-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Tbh fees are currently trivial to me. Maybe people with many cheap PIO buildings would be more affected?


[25-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im a big fan of raising production taxes, i think LM and WAR taxes should stay put, and i think the per-day cost on LM should be 0


[25-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Why specifically the per-day cost?


[25-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think people should be able to post an indefinite order for the one time cost. its silly to punish people that want to constantly offer goods on LM. 0 per-day cost makes LM work more like CX, and fluid markets should be good for everyone


[25-Sep-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Makes sense. That being said, 100 orders on the LM interface is a lot harder to parse than 100 CX orders


[25-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think with our current scale, more LM orders is a goal. if its too much, ill likely shift my stance


[25-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	production fees are assumed to be the majority of any planets tax income, and i think the footprint they have is negligible


[25-Sep-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	our current production fees are 20ICA per day per building for all industries, i think even 40/day/bui would have small impacts on the taxpayer and close to double our income, from my assumptions


[25-Sep-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	EXT on avalon are looking around 1300 daily profit, FP around 1100, BMP around 2000; the production fees are super small, changing them by 10s is minor


[25-Sep-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	yess i agree 0 day increments on LM is nice. boucher has same thing and i think its working well


[25-Sep-21 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	3 per day is super small, but it still makes people think "ill just set it to something short". we should encourage long term LM contracts


[25-Sep-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Most of my buildings are around 2k profit/day, not counting repairs


[25-Sep-21 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So yeah, 40ICA/building/day would make no difference to me


[25-Sep-21 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	seems like a lot -  just checked Prom, Berthier and Boucher - each are 10 or less.


[26-Sep-21 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id assume the increase would be temporary until we were out of debt. it is a lot compared to other ADMs, but i think that the entire universe is just taxing very little. id honestly pay 100/day/bui for 2 months to get a COGC, but that isnt really needed

[26-Sep-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Yes the main planets are charging way less, but they had the luxury of having the majority of players from the start, at a time where they didn't have to worry about safety dropping and such, so got a good buffer from the start


[26-Sep-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Avalon and the other new starter planets have to work a bit harder for that, but I share the believe that raising the taxes to 30 or something like that barely has an noticeable impact but increases tax revenue by a lot


[26-Sep-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	and the more income, the sooner we are out of debt and can lower taxes again :)


[26-Sep-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So, is the next project a safety station?


[26-Sep-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Or something more advanced?


[26-Sep-21 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	yeah next thing after that would for sure be safety station. But lets finish GoGC up first =D


[26-Sep-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	um


[26-Sep-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**JaoriMelkins**:	well, i can't ship the stuff to prom


[26-Sep-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and the technical answer to your question is "juzek"


[26-Sep-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	got it.  illl reach out.  thank you!


[26-Sep-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	well, the spreadsheet didn't say prom, for one.  i think?


[26-Sep-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	it did


[26-Sep-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	oh


[26-Sep-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	ok.


[26-Sep-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	ill see how the contract thing works (i still dont have anything assigned to me, etc)


[26-Sep-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	would I see the contract show up in Prom's LM or something like that>


[26-Sep-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah, itll be a LM contract, but youre likely to talk to their governor first

[26-Sep-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Archasnails**:	Hi,which tab will Tectosilisite(TS) be on in Hortus station Commodity exchange.


[26-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	The easiest way is probably to just open a new buffer and do CXP TS.IC1 (or CXPC or CXOB)


[26-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archasnails**:	tx


[26-Sep-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Assanova**:	seems like a good time to ship in LST


[26-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	thanks!


[26-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	I will let them know to put some up, LM is empty at the moment


[26-Sep-21 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	if you want less than a shipload, contact @postlim


[26-Sep-21 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	JS-572c also has some


[26-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	hmm JS-572c is 1 jump shorter


[26-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	not bad


[26-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	^^ damn, trying to advertise the one that I am affiliated with =D


[26-Sep-21 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	FYI, a ship of mine just picked up a load of LST and will be at HRT in 2d


[26-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	what are you selling them at


[26-Sep-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Seems hard to determine a price right now, given that there are no offers - 120?


[26-Sep-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	hmm imma see if i can just put out shipping orders to moria for now


[26-Sep-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i feel like you could sell at like 180 before people start settling in with more


[26-Sep-21 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I will drop some on the CX at a spread of prices, probably. But I've just put up ads @ 120 for anyone willing to commit in advance


[26-Sep-21 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	how long should I wait before I don't get a reply from the governor of the auctions?


[26-Sep-21 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	and I decide to move the merch that I won the auctions for?


[26-Sep-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	If it was the promitor auction, maybe 3 days? since that was the delivery timeline?


[26-Sep-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	you can probably find the governor on discord too


[26-Sep-21 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id like to talk about taxation again; ill give you some time to read the prior discussion if you havent and would like to :)


[27-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hmm


[27-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	the per day LM fees makes sense, I guess


[27-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I think it's negligible either ways but if it makes people more comfortable making longer ads then sure


[27-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hopefully it doesn't turn out that it's significant


[27-Sep-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	for production taxes, 40/day/bui would be good yeah


[27-Sep-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok; thats about all i had thought of; if anyone has dissenting opinions id be happy to discuss pros/cons


[27-Sep-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Wow BDE is not bad to sell


[27-Sep-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	if you can get any to sell on the cx


[27-Sep-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Hmph, as per the discussion on the planet chat, the current tax plan as proposed by Dragonicorp and agreed to by (as far as I know) Assanova is to raise the production fees per building per day to 40 ICA each to pay off the CoGC. Furthermore, we will remove the daily LM fees (the number 3 - change it to 0). The production fees will remain at those levels until the CoGC debt is paid off, and then return to their current levels (at 20 ICA each).


[27-Sep-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	If there are no dissenting opinions, this plan will come into effect by the next taxation cycle (i.e., in 6 days and 7 hours time). If there are dissenting opinions, please leave a message in the feedback form according to this link. We'll see what sort of responses we get, and then move on from there. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPW6R4NoudV4EHPOYiHpuYIBS8KcvNjg77npubZMto2XINFA/viewform?usp=sf_link

[27-Sep-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	The argument for raising production taxes is that: 1.1) Avalon has a small player base, and therefore a small tax base, and therefore is forced to charge higher taxes to build things if we want to get things done.  1.2) The production fees are per day per building. Therefore, they are pretty insignificant (if you're running a building making 1300/day profit, even at taxes at ~100/day it's not awful). Most buildings probably have much higher profits/day anyways.  1.3) Avalon needs to pay its debts so that it can maintain the CoGC all the time.


[27-Sep-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	The argument for lowering marginal LM fees (the 3 ICA per additional day) 2.1) It's probably insignificant, 3*20 is 60 and not many people put up ads for 20 days anyways 2.2) Encourages the use of LM, because though it's insignificant to the government it kind of feels really bad when you post an LM. The idea is that, especially with the warehouse update, that people will be more comfortable using the LM after this to do things like post sell ads for consumables all the time (and maybe if more people use it it balances out in terms of revenue!)


[27-Sep-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	The argument against raising production fees are 3.1) Other planets have it much much lower! This is true, but the countercounterargument is that [other planets also have much larger player bases, and have been here collecting taxes from full planets from the start of the game. Therefore, since they have a broader tax base it is natural that their taxes are lowered]. 3.2) Taxation is theft!  And that doubling the taxes significantly impact players.


[27-Sep-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
***yesplease** deleted this message.*


[27-Sep-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	The argument against the lowering of marginal LM fees: 4.1) It's insignificant, and not necessary. If people wanted to post ads for 20 days they would have already, coz 60 ICA is not too bad


[27-Sep-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Once again, this tax plan will take effect in 6 days and 7 hours if there are no dissenting opinions


[27-Sep-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'd liek to ask people who dissent to please provide a counterproposal and justify it, if they choose to do so.


[27-Sep-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	👍


[27-Sep-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i cant *prove* it, but just from reading planetary exchanges from UFO and whatnot, several of the large starter planets operate of off a lot of generosity from richer players, such as proxion, phobos, etc. we cant really expect some bigshot to pay our COGC upkeep half on his own, so we kinda *should* expect to see higher taxes here than elsewhere


[27-Sep-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	I think Proxion is player payed because they are going for SCI, which adds a lot of upkeep cost


[27-Sep-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i was doing a bit of research, and i think we are actually pretty restricted in terms of planetary rules due to being in faction space


[27-Sep-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	per-day LM fee is floored at 3, and the production fee is capped at 30


[27-Sep-21 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont really know why this feature is there, but it is :/

**Dragonican**:	you can see an example image there, yesplease should be able to confirm if this is so on their end


[27-Sep-21 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	3 BBH 4 sale 1548 each


[27-Sep-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	ahhhh


[27-Sep-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	unfrotunate


[27-Sep-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	we can't get rid of the per-day LM fee


[27-Sep-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	the minimum is 3!


[27-Sep-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	shame, shame!


[27-Sep-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	lets take Avalon, and declare ourselves an HRT-autonomous-zone


[27-Sep-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	:P


[27-Sep-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	secession!


[27-Sep-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	?Avalexit?


[27-Sep-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Is that even possible?


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no, not with current systems


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think production taxes capped at 30 is even more harmful to our system, i guess this debt will only go away so fast


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	production taxes are capped at 90


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh?


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so we're still good on that


[27-Sep-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	can you share a screen shot of your edit screen, as the wiki is evidentally no longer current


[27-Sep-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yeah if you go look at electronics


[27-Sep-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	it's 90


[27-Sep-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'll change it back in 2 minutes tho


[27-Sep-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	sure; can you share the full UI in the avalon politics channel nonetheless? i dont think we can see the possibilities otherwise


[27-Sep-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	sure


[27-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	twenty ICA taxes? D:


[27-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its been twenty this whole time


[27-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	o it said it just changed


[27-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	@Bant did you see the earlier conversation on taxes?


[27-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we would like to push it up to 40 until the debt is gone; have you objections?


[27-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	No ^^;;


[27-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yesplease turned electronics up to 90 and back down to 20 real quick as proof-of-concept XD


[27-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I guess I pay around 2k in taxes a day here, sheesh


[27-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	ah xD


[27-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	in our earlier analysis, we were comparing the profit/day expected from a starter building vs tax rates


[27-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Oops you want me to take another shipment yesplease?


[27-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	40/day is a drop in the bucket of most buildings making 1000-1500 per day


[27-Sep-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i suppose having a near to full base does make that ad up per day, mm


[27-Sep-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I just had a very productive six hours!  Went from 4K to 13 K


[27-Sep-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	its 40/day per cycle on a building that could cycle 5-6 times aday


[27-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	and then i have 14 of those buildings


[27-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	*20


[27-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	i have 23 buildings here actually lol. running with 5-6h cycle times


[27-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	so with 40 tax I would pay about 4.2k a day


[27-Sep-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	that is not insignificant at all :D


[27-Sep-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@bant I don't see how the cycle time matters? The tax scales with the time


[27-Sep-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	23*40 = 920 ICA/day?


[27-Sep-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	because it takes taxes each time you finish a run of production


[27-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	so 20 buildings finishing a production run 4 times a day at 40 ICA in taxes it quite a bit


[27-Sep-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I was not aware of that :pikachuface:


[27-Sep-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	Dragonican explained it to me a in a discord message just now lol


[27-Sep-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I had always assumed it was per cycle and never bothered actually keeping track of it


[27-Sep-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	and because you get taxed per cycle but i never bothered comparing the amounts


[27-Sep-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	If you queue a short run, the fee is less


[27-Sep-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	When should I consider constructing more buildings?


[27-Sep-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	when you feel like you can keep them supplied


[27-Sep-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	k


[27-Sep-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	also if you can sell what the building produces


[27-Sep-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Would a FP Be worth considering down the road?


[27-Sep-21 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hmm, hard to say


[27-Sep-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	because you have additional transport costs,a nd you're likely buying from the CX ask


[27-Sep-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	your RATs will be a lot more expensive than the CX


[27-Sep-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	or at least, your profit margins will be a lot smaller


[27-Sep-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'm not in the RAT business on Avalon so I can't say for certain, but I'm sure some people here with FPs can tell you how it's like?


[27-Sep-21 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	but do run the numbers yourself


[27-Sep-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	its nice if you have farms over at promito


[27-Sep-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	unfortunately it seems like Prom is going back to pioneer COGC . We farmers are losing ... it will never be the same


[27-Sep-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	nooooooo im so sad


[27-Sep-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	not sarcasm, i detest PIO COGC on prom


[27-Sep-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just to reiterate, as our COGC is almost up, i currently advocate for Food industries COGC on Avalon, to fit in the with the surrounding strengths of HRT. HOWEVER, please please please dont vote PIO, vote literally any industry before PIO. thanks :)


[27-Sep-21 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	What's the problem with PIO CoGC?


[27-Sep-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah why not PIO?


[27-Sep-21 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	PIO COGC is a middle road that serves no one in the end, and specialized industry is far better if we can just choose one. PIO COGC is bad bc its bonus is 10% vs a specialized industry's 25%


[27-Sep-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if even just 40% of your base was an industry and 100% of your workers were PIO, the industry specialization will already outweigh


[27-Sep-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	PIO COGC is condemning ourselves to mediocracy


[27-Sep-21 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Food industries has my vote


[27-Sep-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	:) welcome, and thank you


[27-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i like it when big players show up on avalon, makes me feel like the planet is attractive :D


[27-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Im here to drop a full base of FPs ;)


[27-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	That food industry vote will be very appealing to me


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	ALong with that, how long until we get an LM here?


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Bah, nevermind


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its been here for 3+ months


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I was looking at the wrong screen


[27-Sep-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	this is half of the effect, drawing players due to our unique COGC ^^ rather than being the 10th t0 planet with PIO COGC, and a poor one to boot. instead we can be the Food Industry hub of the world


[27-Sep-21 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I mean


[27-Sep-21 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	It sounds like there are a lot of opportunities to really capitalize on the location of 2 major planets near a CX.


[27-Sep-21 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	It would almost be foolish to give up the advantage


[27-Sep-21 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	Rubicate told me he was thinking of putting a base here if we get FP COGC ^^ draw in big business is what local govs want right? haha


[27-Sep-21 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	come for the FI COGC, stay for the most active planetary chat


[27-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ive been using kovus' new application, and i dont think any other planet comes close to how much we chatter XD


[27-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	lol


[27-Sep-21 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	That explains the lag I felt loading the window


[27-Sep-21 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	We might need a TLDR bot for some of us. Otherwise we will never catch up to this chat


[27-Sep-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	How steady is the Promitor to Avalon traffic? Pretty reliable for shipping contracts?


[27-Sep-21 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	ye people advertise cargo space in chat often


[27-Sep-21 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Dope


[27-Sep-21 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	or if you mean direct prom => avalon or vice versa, thats less common than avalon => CX but it does happen


[27-Sep-21 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	tbh i have a base on both and i rarely fly directly between them myself lol


[27-Sep-21 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i run it from time to time. maybe once a week? if i have business on Prom


[27-Sep-21 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im thinking of starting a little discord server to grease the gears of the Hortus triangle if this FI COGC passes


[27-Sep-21 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Too many discords


[27-Sep-21 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD


[27-Sep-21 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Maybe a chat group>


[27-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	chat group would be nice, except it has no features


[27-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I would feel better about keeping the chat for the shipping close to the rest of my Avalon UI


[27-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think it would be accompanied by a in game group for sure


[27-Sep-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	avalon-boucher-prom is an excellent trifecta of planets, but only 4.2% of the playerbase has 3 bases. thats where we step in, making it safe to horizontally integrate into each planets specialties while helping you find buyers and sellers


[27-Sep-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	or something like that


[27-Sep-21 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	The issue is that we will crush the consumables market down if the rest of the markets arent growing too


[27-Sep-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	im all for it though. an H2O pipeline from Boucher has been something that I have wanted for a bit


[27-Sep-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	i mean, that exists already, boucher has the resource extraction COGC running a few weeks now


[27-Sep-21 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	i dont think prom will stay on agri though too many people non-agri there


[27-Sep-21 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	and honestly not super confident about avalon going FI for hte same reason but we'll se


[27-Sep-21 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if i talk enough, surely theyll agree with me :)


[27-Sep-21 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	even if you dont directly benefit from FI COGC, youll surely enjoy cheaper DW, RAT, and COF


[27-Sep-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	as i just said in UFO though, this game is "silent majority" filled. therell probably be players voting on COGC ive never spoken to before


[27-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the crazy thing though, is the boucher-prom-avalon almost supports all its own costs; as in the main costs of creating DW and RAT and OVE are DW and RAT and OVE. even if prices are suppressed, the business wont get that bad, just bc of how efficient the plan is. in response to theenvoy's "suppressing RAT/DW prices" a few minutes back XD

[27-Sep-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	LST has rebounded to 110 - anyone feel like buying 50 in advance @ 90?


[27-Sep-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	got some PE to unload.  Anyone looking before I post?


[27-Sep-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Maybe, how much?


[27-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	I can do 4.5/ea


[27-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	There's an ad on the LM asking for 5.14/u


[27-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	for 35u


[27-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	what ad? :)


[27-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	thanks lol


[27-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm leaving from the CX with a 12h flight time in a minute. anyone have any small packages to ship?


[27-Sep-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Assanova**:	for PE


[27-Sep-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Anytime!


[27-Sep-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	If you ever need, send me a message.  I can do much better than 5.14/ea.


[27-Sep-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Gnite all


[28-Sep-21 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WordedWheel**:	Just caught up on the cogc chatter. Saw prom was going pio again. Placed my vote for agri and tipped the scales for now. Dont run much pop there though due to all the rigs and farms. Fingers crossed


[28-Sep-21 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	its over now, i was voting for scientist now i have swapped back


[28-Sep-21 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	we will win!


[28-Sep-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	good luck yall!


[28-Sep-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I know how frustrating it is when everyone votes PIO


[28-Sep-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	we'll also cross that bridge on Avalon when we get there


[28-Sep-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	remember to bid if you want to sell some L-fabs!


[28-Sep-21 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Thanks, bid on 3


[28-Sep-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ooh boy, this means the COGC-consumable bid is up next, my favorite!


[28-Sep-21 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Have some HRT>>Avalon shipping up if anyone is doing that trip :)


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	How much space do you have?


[28-Sep-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I need about 200m/300t


[28-Sep-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone have 1x COF I can buy?


[28-Sep-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Ad up :)


[28-Sep-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Still got LST up on the LM for well below CXP...


[28-Sep-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	@theEnvoy, it am looking for someone to take my stuff with them ^^ its only a small one, on LM


[28-Sep-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I have 2 ships about to arrive at HRT. One will probably head to Avalon immediately.


[28-Sep-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got two ships on avalon right now. Happy to send one to HRT if I can get enough cash to cover the fuel


[28-Sep-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ugh, I wish stuff sent with shipping contracts had package tracking :P


[28-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	me too


[28-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You can ask them for the ship ID


[28-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	theoretically tracking individual shipments wouldn't be that hard to add in FIO, but it does feel a little invasive


[28-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah, FIO tries to only show public info


[28-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	And you'd only be able to track shipments carried by plugin users


[28-Sep-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@desan sorry, I wasn't going fast enough to take your package contract


[28-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	anyone need MCG? selling 200 at 20/unit


[28-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	going slower than 1 day for that route? @lordcirth?

**JaoriMelkins**:	Send me a message if so, please.  At work :)

[28-Sep-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I'm selling


[28-Sep-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@desan, yeah, I usually do 2d unless they are aligned


[28-Sep-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I really hope they put electrolysis in the game so you can Convert water to hydrogen and oxygen


[28-Sep-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	and the other way around


[28-Sep-21 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I believe they intend to add electricity & power plants, so I expect that will happen

[28-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	any timeline on those plans?


[28-Sep-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Not that I know of. It seems the next major milestone is a working mobile UI


[28-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	ah well I would much prefer that to a mobile UI


[28-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	BSE.IC1 prefab prices seem to be dropping :(


[28-Sep-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	anyone want to lend me 4 AL? I can give it back in 18 hours


[28-Sep-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I'm a bit short myself, I'm afraid


[28-Sep-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oof


[28-Sep-21 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Got more coming in 2d, though


[28-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	nah I need it rn sadly


[28-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Probably best to just put up a 1-day buy ad on the LM, rather than asking to "borrow" it


[28-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'll have some in 8.5h


[28-Sep-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I could but I have a ship on its way with FLX that I can use to smelt 4 AL


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	just dont want my PP2 to stop running


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	/glances at my four stopped PP2s


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	When will it stop?


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oooof


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	2 hours


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oh it will stop in 9 hours


[28-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	the ship is 2 out


[28-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So, you're good?


[28-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	well it will take 16 hours to smelt the AL


[28-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, I see


[28-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'll have a bit of AL in 8h37m, but I might not be awake to push the button


[28-Sep-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	so it wont be running for 9 hours


[28-Sep-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You wouldn't happen to have GL?


[28-Sep-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	nah I should be fine I just want to get these LSE on their way to mortem to be changed into HSE


[28-Sep-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	sadly I dont. I have SIO though


[28-Sep-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	just no GF


[28-Sep-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah. I was just thinking that if I could switch to LTA, I could stretch my AL more


[28-Sep-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah'


[28-Sep-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	the volume for l-fabs is way lower than bfabs, at least locally


[28-Sep-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	also true


[28-Sep-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	LTA.CI1 was looking good last I checked, though


[28-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	vs LTA.IC1


[28-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	That is quite the gap...


[28-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah


[28-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	the LTA that exist somewhere in the netherspace of shipping contracts between here and BEN keep reminding me of that


[28-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Looks like an even thinner market, though


[28-Sep-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	if I had the cash, I'd buy enough Lfabs to clear the book at BEN and head a ship that way


[28-Sep-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	but alas, am poor


[28-Sep-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	hey avalon crew, you guys all know LG-093a, the planet weve been flying to in order to collect ALO and LST? weeeeell theres a poll to name a planet for free, and i think itd be awesome if LG-093a was named, so we could refer to it more directly. if you would also like LG-093a to be named, vote here!

[28-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Done!  Winning so fae.


[28-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, by a lot


[28-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Yep


[28-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we already shared it around the OIKOS folk, but i think avalon has their own interest as well


[28-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the name that was getting passed around was El Dorado, both to signify the long journey, and as LG-093a has a sizeable gold deposit and makes it pretty unique among the universe


[28-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I think I'm (temporarily?) abandoning my plan to settle there


[28-Sep-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	of course your more common player loves the LST and ALO so much more :)


[28-Sep-21 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ah, has a different planet come up, thejeffcooper?


[28-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I ran the numbers and realized that if my focus is ALO, I can get a similar amount per EXT from Deimos without the 1% wear / trip on my ships


[28-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	plus I wouldn't have to ship in RAT/DW/OVE/etc, since there's a pretty robust population there


[28-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^^ im actually trying to organize some trade from deimos to HRT


[28-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah, well loop me in if you're looking for people/ships


[28-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you would think AI1 would have cheap bfabs due to the PP2+ALO deposits, but thats just not the case. so im getting to the bottom of it and talking to those constructors directly :P


[28-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill jot you down, but its still in talking phases right now


[28-Sep-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	orrr they could all buy my imported avalonian bfabs and make me rich


[28-Sep-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we would be giving them HRT stuff (consumables mostly) and they would give us prefabs


[28-Sep-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah


[28-Sep-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	for whatever reason the strengths of their region arent showing on their cx, so a little more work is needed


[28-Sep-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyone want 3 BBH And 1 BDE Before I take it to the CX?


[28-Sep-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
***TheSmithAries** deleted this message.*


[28-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lordcirth**:	[CAPS] bkg? He's been spamming invites, it seems


[28-Sep-21 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Yeah

**Dragonican**:	ok, ill buy all of those prefabs


[28-Sep-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i do have a request, tho. could you make me 2 BTA for 1000ea? thats the price theyve been going for recently, but the market hollowed out


[28-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	dangit It's already on its way to the CX


[28-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	but I can do the BTA


[28-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD all good, i tried to catch you before but it was slow


[28-Sep-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	cool, thanks


[28-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I have 4 BDE in stock if you want it


[28-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	lord You have any FE?


[28-Sep-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	A little (9), why?


[28-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	could I buy two of them?


[28-Sep-21 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Sure


[28-Sep-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	sure, ill pick up the BDE. im slowly expanding out this base, closing in on 500 area. trying to buy local wherever i can


[28-Sep-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	@dragonican Do you want me to hang on to the fabs when I get to the CX


[28-Sep-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I'll have 5 more BDE in 11h, if you want to buy it all


[28-Sep-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no, not really. if its already at cx, ill just buy what i can from CX


[28-Sep-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	let me consult my shopping list, but ill buy w/e fabs i need that i can afford at the time


[28-Sep-21 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I can probably bring back your order if you don't have a ship there


[28-Sep-21 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i mean, ill definitely buy them if theyre on planet, but dont trouble yourself too much XD


[28-Sep-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	do you have the ad up lordcirth? the Avalon LM has appeared empty to me for a few hours now, am i bugged out or something?


[28-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	For BDE? No, not yet


[28-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	It's actually empty


[28-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh, i got confused by the "up" message


[28-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	That was for FE. How much BDE did you want to buy?


[28-Sep-21 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	You now at this point I'm considering moving strictly to shipping


[28-Sep-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no reason not to do both


[28-Sep-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	true


[28-Sep-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	5 BDE? do you have that much


[28-Sep-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	btw smitharies, your 2 BTA will be the last BTA ill need on Avalon :)


[28-Sep-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I will tomorrow morning; I have 4 right now


[28-Sep-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	4 is fine, ill buy them all


[28-Sep-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	k, up


[28-Sep-21 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im assuming a lot of other Avalonians are nearing 500 area on avalon that joined around when i did, and i hope you all know about the STO. its a building that lots of players put on every finished planet, and it adds capacity to your base. check out BUI STO


[28-Sep-21 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I am aware of it. I guess I'll need one before I hit 500, but not yet


[28-Sep-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just good to plan around, as itll change your final 500 area puzzle


[28-Sep-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	now, if someone has 3 BSE i can put up another FP :p


[28-Sep-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ah, nvm, id need mcg too.


[28-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No BSE on hand. I do have 212 MCG


[28-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	is that for sale?


[28-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Sure, I have some queued


[28-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill buy 15 just in case the BSE comes around


[28-Sep-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	1000 is fine


[28-Sep-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	rain is going to keep BSE in HRT low for a while now


[28-Sep-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oh? why?


[28-Sep-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	he listed 185 BSE@ 975


[28-Sep-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	wow


[28-Sep-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	*153


[28-Sep-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	That will take a while to clear


[28-Sep-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	alright! that was FP #15


[28-Sep-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i slurped up the last 17 PIO, no more until wednesday


[28-Sep-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	lol nice


[28-Sep-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	are you buying inputs:?


[28-Sep-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep! full faith in the plan


[28-Sep-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	DW too or just making rat?


[28-Sep-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	both


[28-Sep-21 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i get semi-regular ship-fuls of H2O from boucher


[28-Sep-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	thats impressive, i have less FPs despite being in the 3 planet chain lmao


[28-Sep-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah, most players arent going to build beyond their own supply


[28-Sep-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im about to establish an HRTriangle that should help 1 and 2 base players in Avalon-Boucher-Prom significantly... just have to do some writing


[28-Sep-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	nice


[28-Sep-21 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Dragon Your BTA Will be ready in 17 hours


[28-Sep-21 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thanks sir


[28-Sep-21 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	want to do the contract now?


[28-Sep-21 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id be happy to pay you now, and you can spend the money early


[28-Sep-21 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	It's okay To do it later


[28-Sep-21 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok


[28-Sep-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	My bid hasn't been registered yet... oh well


[28-Sep-21 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	anyone has any RAT they want to sell?


[28-Sep-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yup ^^


[28-Sep-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	:)


[28-Sep-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Do we have any dedicated C suppliers here?


[28-Sep-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Im thinking about opening a new BMP, but would rather buy the C instead of also building a new Inci.


[28-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	theres actually a universal C shortage right now, but you should almost always be able to find cheap C on CX


[28-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	hmm


[28-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	INC on avalon doesnt make much sense, but there might be someone who makes plain C for export here?


[28-Sep-21 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	when I run the numbers, i can make C for about the same price as it goes for in the market


[28-Sep-21 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	C is very expensive right now, it was going 260 not a week ago. just be aware that current C markets are temporary


[28-Sep-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	ok


[28-Sep-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id recommend checking the 90d price graphs when considering long term plans like BUI


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	there is like 100C on the LM rn


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	OH youre right


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	from me


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD i always forget thats there


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	lol


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Assanova:  can you pretty much always supply C?


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	yes i will perma sell at bid price


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	hmm.


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Might be looking for a dedicated supplier.

[28-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i can only afford 70% of these amounts right now, and would prefer to buy them ratioed so i can build smoothly. but id reasonably bet in a week from now i can afford it all

**KyZekk**:	I have 480 rn


[28-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	haha


[28-Sep-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	what timeline do you want me to put on the BSE contract?


[28-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	since you said you don't have all the cash on hand right now


[28-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	then 11 for the next one.


[28-Sep-21 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can just make a few more if you want them sooner


[28-Sep-21 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah, thats fine, no particular rush, the whole point is to buy them from you guys over market, not for the instant deliver


[28-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	first BSE posted


[28-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	heh, you got me


[28-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how long should I set the second one for?


[28-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the order is backwards sir


[28-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ugh


[28-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	every. time.


[28-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id like to wait to click the second order, its predicated on sales that i have little control over


[28-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sounds good


[28-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	If you're sure you're going to need them and you're just not sure when, we can make it 20d


[28-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	or we can wait


[28-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	either way


[28-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	and you said how many BBH?


[28-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	6 for this next group of buildings


[28-Sep-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	can you put up this ad so I don't screw it up?


[28-Sep-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, what's your price? BBH.IC1


[28-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its been hovering at 1500 for a while now, im fine with that


[28-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Sounds good to me


[28-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can have those to you by midday tomorrow


[28-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	If my math is right


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok. i cant use any of this till wednesday anyways. damn you planetary population mechanic!!!


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	building them preemptively will help with pio growth tho...


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	tomorrow is Wednesday


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	youre very right


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD


[28-Sep-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	lol


[28-Sep-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I have BBH on hand if you want those too btw


[28-Sep-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im good for now, but i might spread the purchasing between you two if so


[28-Sep-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	4 more BDE, and ill throw up some extra FP to get us more PIOs tomorrow


[28-Sep-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	alright I have 2 for sale right now and another 4 in a day or so


[28-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	That's fine with me. I'll do the first set of BBH since I already grabbed the contract, then kyzekk can take the rest


[28-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I also have 10 BDE that will be done in a little less then 2 days


[28-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill need all that BDE, but im also interested in short term BDE to help out the pop report


[28-Sep-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	sadly I sent my entire last batch to the CX


[28-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think the pop report is firing in close to 6 hours, so theres not really much time left. all good


[28-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	kk


[28-Sep-21 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I want 3 experts so much


[28-Sep-21 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	3 experts is where you start to notice it


[28-Sep-21 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	making more buildings, finding more sources of efficiency, and keeping your BUI active will get you there asap


[28-Sep-21 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I was considering making another extractor


[28-Sep-21 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Or will that not count as manufacturing


[28-Sep-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thats resource extraction


[28-Sep-21 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	crap


[28-Sep-21 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	BMP Is the only manufacturing building for  pioneers


[28-Sep-21 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yes, but its got so many recipes, surely you can play around?


[28-Sep-21 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	PT looks decent


[28-Sep-21 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	Yep! BMP has several awesome recipes, but you cant really spam any of them, as the products are lowish volume compared to what the BMP can pump out


[28-Sep-21 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id say its the most difficult starter building, but the most awesome


[28-Sep-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id recommend doing the OVE, PWO, REP, PT, and EXO recipes from time to time. do PE if youve already saturated yourself with the other goods


[28-Sep-21 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	MCG is also worth while, you can make SUN and OFF but only for auctions, and STR has a fair MM for it


[28-Sep-21 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	soooo many options, lots of thinking required on your part


[28-Sep-21 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Another BMP would be nice


[28-Sep-21 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	but I kind of don't Know what to do about My extractor


[28-Sep-21 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i mean, you can just leave it there


[28-Sep-21 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you could also tear it down and do something else with the materials


[28-Sep-21 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	that's what I was thinking


[28-Sep-21 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	youll probably get, 9 BSE back? at least, its 8


[28-Sep-21 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	OH! nvm, wrong building, youll get like 15 or 14 back


[28-Sep-21 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	At this point it's acting more like a leech


[28-Sep-21 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	your call, though i can help explain either side to you


[28-Sep-21 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I need 4 BBH and 2 BDE


[28-Sep-21 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if you already have the money, theres people with those things on planet


[28-Sep-21 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	also, you could buy them on cx and i can ship them back for you soon


[29-Sep-21 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Already have a ship there


[29-Sep-21 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	mmk, sounds like youre close to that building


[29-Sep-21 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	If anybody needs a shipment from HRT to Avalon I will wait 10 minutes


[29-Sep-21 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	how much space?


[29-Sep-21 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	About 493


[29-Sep-21 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	can you give me 5 browsing minutes?


[29-Sep-21 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	yeah


[29-Sep-21 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	alright, 1 package coming up, the ad will be on Avalon LM


[29-Sep-21 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thanks ^^


[29-Sep-21 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Do you have a specific time?


[29-Sep-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no? as long as it gets to my base eventually i dont mind too much


[29-Sep-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	El Dorado is just one suggestion at the moment, if it wins this vote it will get a second vote to get it a name :)


[29-Sep-21 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	it's a shame moria is taken :)


[29-Sep-21 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	ha true =D


[29-Sep-21 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	alright, my opinion on the latest pop report... we are short pioneers, but i think its mostly due to the growth rates of our existing players. players around my age could be finishing up their bases, so theyre at the tippity top of that exponential growth off of 1 base, while a few many-base players are coming to avalon and building 500 area overnight (im looking at you, TheEnvoy)


[29-Sep-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we are still doing great in terms of pop growth, we are just outpacing that growth for this timeframe. +2606 PIO, but they all get eaten near immediately. however, i can also tell you that if we had 90% or more safety, we wouldve had 90% happiness and 5996 net pios instead of that number ^^


[29-Sep-21 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	wow, I'm at 300/305 PIOs. First time I've ever been short


[29-Sep-21 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	nbd though. let's get that safety station done!


[29-Sep-21 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think SST might be a big bandaid for a little cut. we dont actually need safety, from my estimations, but who knows. if Avalon takes off like a rocket after COGC and more big players move here, we need SST


[29-Sep-21 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	safety is just the bottle neck on our migration


[29-Sep-21 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont know why you wouldnt be full on PIO, we werent *that* short?


[29-Sep-21 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	theres 119 PIO in the reserve pool right now, and i kept all 1000 of mine


[29-Sep-21 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Oh, nvrm, I was short before - I didn't bother building a hab for the last 5


[29-Sep-21 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Unemployment is 0%, though, but there's reserve still


[29-Sep-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Oh, I forgot to buy TRU. Anyone got some to sell on the LM?


[29-Sep-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im almost certain there is, but we will see if they respond to you or not


[29-Sep-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	alright, asking around again, trying to buy local. any BDE on planet? will buy up to 6


[29-Sep-21 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I got that 5 now


[29-Sep-21 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill take it


[29-Sep-21 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	1 BDE anyone? XD


[29-Sep-21 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	can you set up the LM ad soon? ill have to go soon


[29-Sep-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	yup, sorry


[29-Sep-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	up


[29-Sep-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thx


[29-Sep-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	still looking for 1 BDE :)


[29-Sep-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	wait a second, i forgot we were 20 BBH away from finishing the SST XD thats a lot more realistic than rushing to build the whole thing


[29-Sep-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	Anyone have 20 Dw and rat for sale?


[29-Sep-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	/sigh... just bought enough materials to build another HB1, only to then realize that I already have enough capacity for the expansion I wanted


[29-Sep-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	oh well. I guess I'll put it in the "second base" pile


[29-Sep-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	got some tiny shipping for HRT -> avalon up


[29-Sep-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	got it. have a ship coming home tonight anyways, happy to grab them


[29-Sep-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	btw I'm travelling today, I'll do up the procurements at night (or maybe tomorrow oops)


[29-Sep-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ok, good to know! Will there be a new procurement for CoGC consumables and/or SST parts?


[29-Sep-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So I just updated my spreadsheet with the latest prices, and bfabs and lfabs aren't looking good...


[29-Sep-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Anyone want PWO?


[29-Sep-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

Name THAT Planet Round 4
I’d like to propose the name Danakil for OT-442b; it’s a region in Ethiopia with sulfur hot springs, and given that OT-442b has both SCR and H20 I think it would be fitting

[29-Sep-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im going to buy the 20 BBH and throw it in myself if we dont get it prepared by next pop report ^^ though i would like to be payed back those 20 BBH later, if that works out


[29-Sep-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	@yesplease could i get a loose sign of confidence on a move like above?


[29-Sep-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	If so, I can be your BBH supplier. Going to have to spin up some more SMEs, but I was planning to do that anyways


[29-Sep-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Hmm, hard competition with a starter planet


[29-Sep-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the 20 BBH is due next wednesday


[29-Sep-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	our opponent is strong, but we are only 1 vote behind them :muscle:


[29-Sep-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont really mind who contributes the BBH etc, where they come from, its just a big failure on our part if the SST lags another week behind


[29-Sep-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	We'd need someone to make SUN as well, right?


[29-Sep-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	nope!


[29-Sep-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the SST can work in 3rds, so each good gives us a third of its effect


[29-Sep-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the amount of safety we need isnt that significant, so we are probably good just feeding it DW to start


[29-Sep-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if we need more safety, we give if OFF, and then SUN is last


[29-Sep-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, I see


[29-Sep-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill do the math properly once it gets thrown up, but we actually know how much safety an SST provides and how much we need


[29-Sep-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	SST gives 2500, so SST with just DW gives 833 safety


[29-Sep-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumAnt**:	when the SUN is necessary, I can produce it


[29-Sep-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im sure itll come down to auction ^^ theres many people wanting to make SUN, its pretty lucrative :P


[29-Sep-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumAnt**:	depends on price.... :-P


[29-Sep-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	sure; *most* planetary auctions ive seen pay way too much for SUN


[29-Sep-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone else have shipping they need from HRT?


[29-Sep-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so, our population from the pop report consumes 9065.75 safety. im going to assume we had 265 open plots at time of pop report for next step


[29-Sep-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	leaving soon, hoping to arrive tonight


[29-Sep-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I can in principle make 7 BBH/day if both my plants loop it


[29-Sep-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	id be happy to buy them and front the small cost of getting the SST running until the auction processes


[29-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can make ~14.5 BBH / day, but I don't have the AL on hand and my SMEs can't smelt my ALO fast enough to keep up with that pace


[29-Sep-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	it makes no difference whether you finish tomorrow or next tuesday. just, sometime before wednesday


[29-Sep-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I'm almost out of AL, but I have some on my ship and some on jeff's


[29-Sep-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I re-ran the numbers and if I do my planned expansion when my ship arrives and then buy some COF for my workers, I can pump out 15 BBH/day


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	*16


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I don't have the cash for COF, though


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Nice. I'm expanding into a WPL next


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ooh


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so you could make NL?


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	COT and NL, yeah


[29-Sep-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Both of which I use


[29-Sep-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Instead of buying my usual 10 RCO, 10 COT, I bought 20 RCO this time :)


[29-Sep-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Don't know if I will - a PP2 making LDE 50% of the time will keep up with 100% of a WPL


[29-Sep-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah, good to know


[29-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	WPL and BMP making PWO ratio 1:1, very pleasant


[29-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah^


[29-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	last call for shipping HRT -> avalon, 400t / 350 m^3 available


[29-Sep-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	wait other way around


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I split 50/50 COT/NL, then I'd be feeding 1 BMP and 25% of a PP2, which is fine because there are 4 lfabs


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	400m^3 / 350t


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh, ive got stuff for that direction then


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	awesome. toss it up :)


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	lol, I also thought you meant the other direction


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But you meant t/m^3


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	>.<


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	words are hard


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Anybody want PWO?


[29-Sep-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I do have a ship sitting idle and unfueled on avalon. If there's enough cargo to pay for the trip (and if someone can supply SF), I'm happy to send it


[29-Sep-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	dont posting


[29-Sep-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	*done


[29-Sep-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	can you supply the SF?


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	my tank is literally empty :|


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Jeff, you still on HCX?


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yep


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I can put up an order for you to bring to Avalon


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	cool. avalon LM or hrt?


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	looks like desan has set the SF price in HRT to be 8.6. how much do you need?


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	my ship will arrive at avalon in 1d, and probably turn around immediately with some of yesplease's bulk shipping


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	from the CX to Avalon. It's 149t, I believe


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and I have stupid amounts of fuel on Avalon, if you need any ;)


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ideally 250u, which is enough for an express round trip both ways if I need it


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	let me throw up the shipping ad. Will be on the Avalon LM


[29-Sep-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	SG


[29-Sep-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	My scheduling is starting to become non-trivial


[29-Sep-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I sized all my BMP orders to be as close to 12h as possible, so they wouldn't get rearranged by 2 BMPs in parallel. Does that make sense?


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	posted


[29-Sep-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	got it


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Eh, makes it easier to reason about anyway


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	thanks, saves me a trip


[29-Sep-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sure thing!


[29-Sep-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	my ships are burning hot, usually. No time for those leisurely trips!


[29-Sep-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I go quite slow, currently. As I start carrying more capital per trip, I will probably speed up. Feels wasteful though.


[29-Sep-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i realized i could go twice as fast for about .02% of my daily profit lost, and i opted in. after you get your base going, skimping on fuel is pretty similar to refusing to sell to a big 1 or 2 ica below you, pretty inconsequential in the scope of things


[29-Sep-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	but its also nowhere near needed, i just like ships going faster


[29-Sep-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I try to keep in mind that in PrUn, there are no finite resources :)


[29-Sep-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well, no finite materials*


[29-Sep-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	desan makes SF and FF here on avalon so i dont have to worry about fuel as much, ive been lax about it ^^


[29-Sep-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	okay, now that my computer has recovered, I can actually send this ship :P


[29-Sep-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok, short interlude as i worked through some more POPI math with piboy, BUT


[29-Sep-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we are consuming 9065.75 safety, and providing 7750. an SST with just DW will give us 833.3 more safety, bringing us above 90% safety satisfaction, doubling our migration. i think this is worth the small costs, and will make it more feasible for large players to quickly throw down bases on Avalon


[29-Sep-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	How much DW?


[29-Sep-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sounds good to me. I can certainly loan BBH to avalon


[29-Sep-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	BUI SST says nothing about upkeep costs, and I can't find it online?


[29-Sep-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Where are these equations documented?


[29-Sep-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the equations are documented on some wiki, but i mostly use this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WUseI_GzjReLFQ-EWDh-yitlTiDrT36T/view

[29-Sep-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Thanks!


[29-Sep-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	recent discovery though, not documented,


[29-Sep-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	bases now provide 50 health and safety instead of 75

[29-Sep-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	cool!


[29-Sep-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	setup the buy? 2@1000ea?


[29-Sep-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	K


[29-Sep-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Ad is up


[29-Sep-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thanks ^^


[29-Sep-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Your shipment will be here  in 35 minutes


[29-Sep-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	nice


[29-Sep-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So, what does it take to get technicians? Does someone have to build a set/tech hybrid building to make some jobs and get unemployment from 100% to 0%?


[29-Sep-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep, thats it ^^


[29-Sep-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	*in theory*


[29-Sep-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you need their happiness to be above 70 to get them to migrate, and i think if theres open job theyll begin to educate as well


[29-Sep-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Seems like CLR and shipbuilding are the only ones with more than 50% settlers


[29-Sep-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	most people who try to develop TEC practically ignore the profit in the mean time, from my experience


[29-Sep-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think LAB is the "standard" for this purpose


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Why a lab? Just lots of jobs?


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	CLR has no reliable products right now


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	same can be said for ship building


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and yes, it only costs lfabs but makes 70 tech jobs


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, I guess there is a (small) market for DDT as well


[29-Sep-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	DDT and THF are both fairly useful. big emphasis on DDT for prom


[29-Sep-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	desan could speak towards how well LABs work in HRT, he has a handful


[29-Sep-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Can I not have two separate BMP ques?


[29-Sep-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No, there's one queue, each building pops the first queued item when it's free


[29-Sep-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	you can make different things in the same queue though


[29-Sep-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	But not at the same time?


[29-Sep-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Each BMP grabs a different order from the queue. Right now, one of mine is making OVE and one PE


[29-Sep-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	lol, only 8 FP?


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You must get a lot of notifications


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	thats not on avalon, I have 13 FP here


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	and yes


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	i do T>T


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	notifications bug out at some point, they dont all fire


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	>has 20 FP running 3 hour recipes on average


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	when you have them all synced together like this you only get 1 notifiation


[29-Sep-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	i have assumed that is on purpose


[29-Sep-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	unless you have the notification window open, then you get all of them


[29-Sep-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anybody have 1 STL?


[29-Sep-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	nobody will just *have* STL, its a small volume good. you  might be able to get someone to make STL for you?


[29-Sep-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Does anybody have a problem with me taking all the shipping contracts?


[29-Sep-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no, as long as you deliver them all on time


[29-Sep-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	nope as long as you can get them done on time


[29-Sep-21 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	lol


[29-Sep-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	2 Full ships on their way to HRT

**KyZekk**:	yeah same lol


[29-Sep-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Don't worry I will get them on the second trip


[29-Sep-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	OVE & PWO up on the LM. If they get bought quick I'll post more; or if someone wants a bigger order let me know


[29-Sep-21 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I don't need supplies for a while now


[29-Sep-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	uhoh Not sure if I have on the fuel to get to the  station


[29-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	enoughh*


[29-Sep-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i can pass some fuel along


[29-Sep-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	In transit?


[29-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Does it let you submit a flight plan you can't do? I don't think so


[29-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh, yeah, if the ship took off, you can make it the whole way


[29-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Then I should be fine


[29-Sep-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Any MAI suppliers here?


[29-Sep-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its near impossible to make MAI on avalon, i dont know if anyone is running HYF for MAI here


[29-Sep-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Wow steel is woorth more than power tools


[29-Sep-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	1k -> 5 * 420


[29-Sep-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I mean per unit


[29-Sep-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Still worth it though


[29-Sep-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well yeah. If the cost was even, everybody would make PT until it wasn't


[29-Sep-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	(Subject to demand limits)


[29-Sep-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I still want to settle VH-331c


[29-Sep-21 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Or prom


[29-Sep-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Why does my pioneers required fluctuate


[29-Sep-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	It shouldn't. Do you mean the number in parentheses? That's not the required number, that's reserve


[29-Sep-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	Huh, that's an odd planet


[29-Sep-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	And someone's already there :o


[29-Sep-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	or, someone was there, it looks like the pio's are dying off lol


[29-Sep-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	still someone there


[29-Sep-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	landed 16 days ago


[29-Sep-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	interesting, they must only be running like 2 or 3 buildings


[29-Sep-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	yeah 15%


[29-Sep-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	wow best system in the universe we got 5 planets colonized


[29-Sep-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	anyone going Prom>>Avalon soon?


[29-Sep-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	im going soon

[29-Sep-21 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	is assanova going to be the one to carry the final torch for avalon? prestigious!


[29-Sep-21 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Not the final pieces, but the expensive one =D


[29-Sep-21 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^^

**lordcirth**:	What piece is that?


[29-Sep-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the electronic parts of the COGC


[29-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, I didn't realize it needed those


[29-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Looks expensive all right


[29-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	PPS VH-331g will get you to see it, for anyone who hasnt


[29-Sep-21 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	Oh my i didnt know i had the honor to carry such a package


[29-Sep-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Dragonican, spilling the beans, opening me up for piracy... ^^


[29-Sep-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	dw Desan im upping security theres no way any pirates are boarding my ship


[29-Sep-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	haha but what if you are the pirate  =D


[29-Sep-21 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	😳


[29-Sep-21 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	No I did a background check, triple A rating, I have full confidence in you ^_^


[29-Sep-21 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Looks like bids aren't being processed until tomorrow. Hopefully I won at least one, I need to buy so much AL


[29-Sep-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	same


[29-Sep-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Hopefully selling a shipload of ALO on the CX helped drop AL prices; It didn't make me a lot of profit


[29-Sep-21 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	do you have any left on planet to sell?


[29-Sep-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Nope, I pre-sold some on the LM and dumped the rest on the CX last week. I might do another run if the price goes back up, though


[29-Sep-21 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	gotcha


[29-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I knew the profit would be low, but I was hoping to benefit from a drop in AL prices. Which did happen, but I can't claim causality because who knows


[29-Sep-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	wahoo! my bse order arrived, now ill use up all the PIO i was allotted this week


[29-Sep-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	need any BBH?


[29-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	your BTA will be here in ~45m


[29-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im gated by BDE more than anything, i think


[29-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I actually bought some that I'm probably not going to use after all


[29-Sep-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how many do you need?


[29-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i can use 1 right now, and then ill need to do math


[29-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I'll have 10 done in 26 hours


[29-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got 10 on my ship that's arriving in 45m


[29-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	cool! our pio situation isnt that bad, but it does mean i cant finish my base till next  report


[29-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm happy to sell you the one you need if you put up a contract


[29-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Greetings!


[29-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I don't know what BDE.IC1 typically sell for


[29-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	is there a way to search the chat?


[29-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	can i get them for 1200? they sorta just spiked


[29-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	can you do 1230? that's what I paid


[29-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	well 1229.90 if you want to be precise


[29-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	XD sure


[29-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im a little bit short on being able to buy everything i could build this week, but if youre willing to buy a little DW/RAT/OVE/PWO ill be there. either way, i need 5 BDE


[29-Sep-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oh dragon can I trade 5 BDE for the equivaling in RAT and DW?


[29-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'd also be interested in a deal like that, but I'm okay on RAT and DW for a while


[29-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so kyzekk can have this one :)


[29-Sep-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	("a while" = "a few days," but still)


[29-Sep-21 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok, i accept, kyzekk


[29-Sep-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	yeah, thats fine


[29-Sep-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	are you fine with valuing the BDE at 1200ea? and then ill do the math for how much RAT/DW that gets you


[29-Sep-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah


[29-Sep-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	thats good for me


[29-Sep-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and ill also assume you want  half RAT half DW


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Ugh.  First trip to the CX in a while for silly H.


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah what are your prices?


[29-Sep-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	RAT@51, DW@41, friend prices


[29-Sep-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	setup two buy orders, each for 1 total, buying 65RAT and 65DW


[29-Sep-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	that will get me 58 RAT and 73 DW


[29-Sep-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	for 5 BDE


[29-Sep-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok, if thats the amounts you want, sure

**Dragonican**:	wahoo

**thejeffcooper**:	yaay


[29-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got to find some ALO in the next ~2d. I'll probably just buy from the CX


[29-Sep-21 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	If you buy ~100, the price might go up enough for me to risk dispatching a ship


[29-Sep-21 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anybody want 400 FF?


[29-Sep-21 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	Welcome, @Rubicate!


[30-Sep-21 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@Vincent-1 - do you have pro? If not, to have to buy at the CX (BSE.IC1)


[30-Sep-21 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	lol, now somebody destroyed the BTA market? Who is selling it at 50% of cost?


[30-Sep-21 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Oof. Glad mine sold before that happened


[30-Sep-21 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Just hoping my ship full of BSE gets to the CX before that one crashes


[30-Sep-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I should probably make a bit of everything, so I can afford to wait for rebound


[30-Sep-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	welcome rubi ^^


[30-Sep-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	going avalon > HRT soon, you have like 3 hours to post


[30-Sep-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	How fast you going?


[30-Sep-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	zoomin


[30-Sep-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	In that case, yeah, I'll hitch a ride


[30-Sep-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Dragon, you still want more prefabs?


[30-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sdlouisee**:	Flying back from HRT soon and still have room for 400t/450m3. Unfortunately I am still pending so I can't take the A contracts that are there


[30-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I would post 150t of FE, but I'm so short on cash that I'll do without XD


[30-Sep-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i need to take a little cool down with prefabs and built buffers back up, i think


[30-Sep-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	@sdlouisee consider PMing those people and asking if they can repost at P rating


[30-Sep-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	most people just put high ratings as a shield against noobs messing up or whatnot


[30-Sep-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if you reach out and ask, youve probably already hit their skill/trust requirements


[30-Sep-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sdlouisee**:	Thanks for the tip I will try that #


[30-Sep-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	someone asked a few days ago but i have my answer now, the SST would consume 50 DW every 3 days, or 16.6 DW per day, which should cost no more than 664 ICA a day


[30-Sep-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	running the SST at 1/3 power


[30-Sep-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	last call, heading to HRT, lots of space open, fast burn


[30-Sep-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Oh I've got some for you


[30-Sep-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	What's your rate?


[30-Sep-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	4/t minimum 100ICA


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	So you charge 25 ICA per ton?


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if its more than 200t/m tell me first


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	nope, tiny package. prefabs are light :)


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	4ICA/t, or 100 ICA


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	whichever is higher

[30-Sep-21 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Just built my WPL! Got 62 of the 70 settlers I needed; remind me, when can I get the rest? 24hr, or POPR?


[30-Sep-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	9.99 each


[30-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	POPR


[30-Sep-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Thanks


[30-Sep-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Another reason to boost settler pop


[30-Sep-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think we have plenty of settler pop, you just got scamazed


[30-Sep-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You think reserve % should be increased?


[30-Sep-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im going to do some math to make sure i understand the formulas as they are, and then speak


[30-Sep-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	how many SET were you allowed to draw this week?


[30-Sep-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok, so it seems right now that each player is allowed to take at most 10% of all the excess of a pop type per week. i think it would be reasonable to raise that to something like 15% or 20%, but i dont know if we could change that


[30-Sep-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Can anyone use these 8 BSE and 44 MCG?

**Dragonican**:	ill just write them out anyways; can we raise the taxes now, as to not miss a cycle? and, can i throw 20 BBH into the SST to make sure it gets online asap, and the govt can owe me that 20 BBH?


[30-Sep-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	*raise the taxes to 40 ICA per industry as we discussed, and there were no objectors

[30-Sep-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yes! im doing food industries right now, i run 17 FP and plan to get up to 20


[30-Sep-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	loooots of RAT and DW


[30-Sep-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I know where to get food now


[30-Sep-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i sell very cheap too ^^


[30-Sep-21 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	You get the Water on prom?


[30-Sep-21 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	boucher


[30-Sep-21 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Probably expensive on prom due to all the farms?


[30-Sep-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	well, boucher has a much better water deposit and a COGC that helps with water extraction, as well as players that specialize in extracting water, so the waters very cheap!


[30-Sep-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	which is why my DW is cheap


[30-Sep-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Pretty good deal


[30-Sep-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i try to give good deals while still making money


[30-Sep-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i hope youll do the same for me ^^


[30-Sep-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I will try


[30-Sep-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont expect much out of new players, its fine to fend for yourself, but if TheSmithAries ever beomes the richest player in the galaxy i hope youll throw me some bread crumbs


[30-Sep-21 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I'll give you guys more than breadcrumbs


[30-Sep-21 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh boy, can i have the whole last slice of bread? XD


[30-Sep-21 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	How about the loaf


[30-Sep-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyway I don't think I will be there for a few years :)


[30-Sep-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	me neither! but its worth dreaming


[30-Sep-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	It's good to have goals


[30-Sep-21 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im going to drive RAT and DW below the MM >:D


[30-Sep-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	CoGC electronics have been submitted

[30-Sep-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'm very happy to announce that bidding for our CoGC is completed, and our winners are getting the L-fabs to me as we speak


[30-Sep-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'll gather these L-fabs on Avalon as soon as I can, it depends on when I get them from the Benten region suppliers but I regularly ship Benten <-> Hortus, so the travel time shouldn't be too much of a delay


[30-Sep-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	anyhow


[30-Sep-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i had two questions!


[30-Sep-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	while youre here


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	If you click on the link above, you'll notice two procurements - 1 for the SST and 1 for the CoGC upkeep


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yes! ask away


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	can we raise the taxes now, as to not miss a cycle? and, can i throw 20 BBH into the SST to make sure it gets online asap, and the govt can owe me that 20 BBH? 09/30 07:05 PM [IKO] Dragonican *raise the taxes to 40 ICA per industry as we discussed, and there were no objectors


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	copypasted from earlier, sorry for formatting


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yes, throw in the BBH


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	kk


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'll throw in some DW as well


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just wanted the go ahead, im not ready to donate 30k off 1 base


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just loan it


[30-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^^


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	precisely, it'll work the same way the WAR happened


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	anyways on taxation


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'd refrain from raising it this cycle, just so that we can see the change in the effect better next cycle


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	effect of?


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	the tax raise


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ah, sure


[30-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	like, so we can better gauge how much revenue there is


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yeah


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	also for people to object, but everyone seems on board


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	anyways just to repeat


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	We are taking bids for the following items: BBH, DW, MCG, PE, RAT!

[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I know many of you make these things


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so hopefully this auction will be more accessible for the rest of Avalon!


[30-Sep-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	are we on the same page with just putting DW in the SST for next week?


[30-Sep-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	also, if you know anyone off-planet producing these and are willing to supply, do pass them that link


[30-Sep-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yep, check my notes in the procurement


[30-Sep-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	on DW


[30-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ok, thats all i had to say on a governmental level.


[30-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	We'll monitor it the coming week and if necessary do OFF after


[30-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	but by and large it looks like DW is sufficient?


[30-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^^ id say so


[30-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	on a personal level, i hope youll vote FoodInsutries COGC, i think the reduced consumables prices could be just as beneficial to you as PIO COGC might be


[30-Sep-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	:D


[30-Sep-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I don't have a position on the CoGC industry yet, but as long as it's not PIO I think it's good for Avalon in the long term!


[30-Sep-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	PIO is a nice short term boost, but if you know for certain that there's a 25% boost in a particular industry you can transition to that


[30-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	alright, im happy you think that way. PIO COGC supporters scare me


[30-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yeah


[30-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	especially with 2nd bases right, the 25% becomes so much more important


[30-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	rip like all the Prom people who suffered under PIO for so long


[30-Sep-21 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	tyranny of the majority!


[30-Sep-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont even know if its tyranny, i feel its closer to a logical fallacy. "whatever most equally provides direct benefit is best for everyone"


[30-Sep-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	most PIO COGC voters have very good intentions


[30-Sep-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the math just doesnt add up, and they often overlook the transition factor


[30-Sep-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Greetings


[30-Sep-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Good luck on the election, Drag.


[30-Sep-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	hello; ill be dropping my platform in a day or so, i hope youll see a candidate you like in me


[30-Sep-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
***TheSmithAries** deleted this message.*


[30-Sep-21 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	:)


[30-Sep-21 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	The last two shipments of yours might be late by a couple of hours @yesplease


[30-Sep-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Ugh, the first time I ship something of any value between CXs, the shipper missed the deadline with no communication. I hope it's just someone who isn't on every day and not piracy


[30-Sep-21 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	who? i think its worth sharing


[30-Sep-21 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got one contract that's extended with them and one that expires in the morning. If they miss that one too, I'll share


[30-Sep-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Until then I'm going to try to assume good intent


[30-Sep-21 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	sure, i guess id just like to avoid late shippers myself. ^^all good tho


[30-Sep-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	man.  my H will be landing 20 minutes before my BMP run starts lol


[30-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	talk about cutting it close


[30-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	almost screwed that pony


[30-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Now I can sell 300 FF @  3,000 ica


[30-Sep-21 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Oh hey, they just filled the contract!


[30-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	great!


[30-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	That's funny someone tried to buy those 8 BSE for 11 ICA


[01-Oct-21 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I have 2 BDE for sale for 1100 each


[01-Oct-21 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im all full till next wednesday ^^


[01-Oct-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oof


[01-Oct-21 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	ill always have my BDE ads on the LM :)


[01-Oct-21 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I only have 5 though not 16 lol


[01-Oct-21 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and your BDE ads are a little stinky compared to CX right now


[01-Oct-21 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	welp, im officially capped by lack of PIO on avalon. on a tangental note, im bringing 20 BBH from CX to make sure this thing gets done this week


[01-Oct-21 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	this thing = SST


[01-Oct-21 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	46/22 space left on ship going HRT > Avalon, express route(~10h), waiting about 15 minutes


[01-Oct-21 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	yep theyre meant to be slightly better then bid price


[01-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	whoo! SST!


[01-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	\o/


[01-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	woohoo, SST is here, we shouldnt suffer from any lack of PIO/SET soon


[01-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Will this get us to 100% safety?


[01-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if we ran all 3 consumables, for sure


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But with DW?


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	like 93% ish


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Nice


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill math it again to get a better number


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	basically the numbers that should matter to you as a resident is that migration will go from 10% of existing pop to 20% of existing pop, or so


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Nice, that's a big deal


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	migration is happiness - 70% btw


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so that top end has big effects


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, so that amplifies the difference a lot. Cool, thanks


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	also happiness is a 5 week moving difference weighted towards recent weeks... so we wont shoot up to that 20% migration region, we will trend towards it


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Hey, we have a safety station? Wowza! Maybe this industrialized ball of mud may be family-friendly yet! I won't raise my kids here, but maybe get a dog...


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	There must be an election going on...projects getting completed...


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	Ray, we're putting up a COGC this week ^^;


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	We're hitting the big time! What resources are we going to need on a regular basis?


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	RAT DW MCG PE


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Speaking of industrialized ball of mud, I see an ad on our LM selling 1 DW for 12,100 ICA. Why didn't we leave Nestlé on EARTH?!


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ill give you 1 DW for 12099 if it makes you feel better ;)


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	the PE is for all the batons the hit people, and the MCG to burry the corpses


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Do you think I am Evian spelled backwards?


[01-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	hey look, someone wrote gullible on the ceiling!


[01-Oct-21 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	oh wait, I thought that was the SST upkeep, nvm then ^^


[01-Oct-21 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	"please come again, I am here all week"


[01-Oct-21 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so yesplease has thrown in enough DW to keep it fueled for a week, so we are set for our test, aka set for the next 10 days


[01-Oct-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Just bought a shipload of hydrogen - anyone want some?


[01-Oct-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Hello Avachums - I'm back from my holiday and rejoicing in having the use of a mouse and decent sized screen again!


[01-Oct-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	woo!


[01-Oct-21 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	welcome back!


[01-Oct-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	\o/


[01-Oct-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	welcome back msorange! we've made leaps and bounds of progress while you were away... but not bc of it!


[01-Oct-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also *someone* used up all our spare pioneers :P


[01-Oct-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think i might be using more than my "fair share" :P


[01-Oct-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	in other news why does assanova need 16 BTA?


[01-Oct-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	is he building himself an emergency centre?


[01-Oct-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no clue, havent really asked


[01-Oct-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	he had buy order for 32 BDE that either got filled or taken down


[01-Oct-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so for some reason I made a bunch of LTA... does anyone need some?


[01-Oct-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	it seemed like a good idea at the time


[01-Oct-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	right so given I've been basically off chat for a week can anyone give me a quick recap of what I've missed?


[01-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I see there's a safety station now :)


[01-Oct-21 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yup! And the last bid contracts for CoGC are in progress


[01-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	hmm I should probably do some bidding - I've let it slip whilst I've been away


[01-Oct-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	@SSJ5 I would like to return your 11 ICA


[01-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	it will cost you at least 53 ICA to do that :|


[01-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	meh;)


[01-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
***TheSmithAries** deleted this message.*


[01-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I think @desan May have made a mistake on the LM


[01-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so, afaik, all bids on MATs to build the COGC have closed, so it should be up in 7 days at most. some of the bidders live in BEN. after that, we wait 7 days to vote on what we actually want, as the COGC is stuck in limbo on PIO for first week


[01-Oct-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no, @thesmitharies, that one is intentional. people often sell DW at insanely high prices to transfer cash


[01-Oct-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I stand corrected that's ingenious


[01-Oct-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I hope they have the ability to transfer money as something they're going to put in


[01-Oct-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@msorange by "in progress" I meant the bids closed, the LM contracts are signed, but not all fulfilled


[01-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	but the consumables for the COGC and SST are currently being bid on ^^


[01-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i got halfway through entering my bids and stopped, and now i dont remember which bids i made XD ill be waiting for yesplease to help me sort my mess


[01-Oct-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyone willing to takee these 5 MAG off my hands?


[01-Oct-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you could just set up a shipping contract


[01-Oct-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	whatever is the highest


[01-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	sure


[01-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'll put up a dodad

**Dragonican**:	^^


[01-Oct-21 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@msorange if you've got so many in stock, care to make the same deal again?


[01-Oct-21 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	can do - mate's rates :D

**JaoriMelkins**:	speaking of which


[01-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	i got PE, if anyone needs :)


[01-Oct-21 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Did you bid on the PE for the CoGC upkeep?


[01-Oct-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Also, if you are making lots of PE, you need any hydrogen?


[01-Oct-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anybody have cargo for HRT?


[01-Oct-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've gotta send a ship to get some cargo, but it's mostly empty on the way out there


[01-Oct-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	your to fill avalon -> hrt?


[01-Oct-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	do you have cargo?


[01-Oct-21 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	you still have room?


[01-Oct-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, ship is basically empty


[01-Oct-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	not leaving until it's full or I'm about to fall asleep... whichever comes first


[01-Oct-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	when you leaving?


[01-Oct-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	when will your cargo be ready?


[01-Oct-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	as long as it can fly overnight, I don't much care


[01-Oct-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	just some fabs that are good to go now


[01-Oct-21 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lordcirth**:	np. Next time I will haul LST again instead of H...


[02-Oct-21 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone have O.IC1 and/or FLX.IC1 locally that they could sell me a few of?


[02-Oct-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think kyzekk just put up a CHP here


[02-Oct-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	with the intent of lots of FLX


[02-Oct-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	woohoo


[02-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I just put up 50 LST for 100/u.


[02-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Ms Orange, pick up your fuel


[02-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	picked up :)


[02-Oct-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	now back to playing Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous


[02-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	gotta love a game with a colon... hmmm that sounded better before I typed it


[02-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	LOL


[02-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I need to get back to Starbase... My new ship isn't fast enough, so need to do a slight redesign, and add more thrusters


[02-Oct-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
***komuroto** joined.*


[02-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	if people want to regularly put LST contracts up here I will gladly buy them on the regular instead of shipping in my own LST


[02-Oct-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Nice, I may do that when a ship is free


[02-Oct-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You willing to buy in lots up to 183?


[02-Oct-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	should have 10U of FLX here in 4 hours


[02-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	@lordcirth Yes


[02-Oct-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyone want 44 MCG?


[02-Oct-21 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Anyone sell PG locally?


[02-Oct-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Greetings.


[02-Oct-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Do we have any dedicated C suppliers here?


[02-Oct-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	also looking for MAI


[02-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	MAI would more likely be Promitor


[02-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	More Hydrogen up on the LM, btw


[02-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Thank you!


[02-Oct-21 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Apart from the BMP ,Manufacturing doesn't seem very good for profit


[02-Oct-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Until you get to engineers or scientists


[02-Oct-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well, the BMP is versatile - nice for making a rotation of goods to hedge risk. But also most people have one too.


[02-Oct-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	youre right, but you dont need to go beyond BMP


[02-Oct-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I expect to make a tolerable profit on the WPL I just built, but not as high as my PP1&PP2.


[02-Oct-21 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	yeah^


[02-Oct-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But some of my most profitable goods consume a lot of WPL products, so it's good to reduce my risk and 2 fewer things on the shopping list


[02-Oct-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	The main problem with manufacturing that I see is a coonsiderable amount of products have low demand


[02-Oct-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	so I might still go towards carbon making


[02-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Would that be beneficial To Avalon?


[02-Oct-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Lots of us use Carbon. I've seen LM ads buying 50 at a time


[02-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	lots of people here smelt their own ore and turn it into prefabs, from what i here


[02-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	The thing with the BMP is that you can rapidly pivot between PE, OVE, PWO, MCG, PT...


[02-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	REP, EXO, OFF, SUN, :D


[02-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I am  going to keep the BMP for those products


[02-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I only use carbon for PE, but I have 50% of BMP doing that


[02-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	this is sort of a next step


[02-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Keep in mind 2 things; having a second industry is fine, you're not going to hit 4 experts for a while anyway. And, we will probably have a Food Industry CoGC very soon


[02-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I already have 2, so I'm not likely going FI until I have a second base to move my construction to


[02-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I think I rather get rid of the second BMP temporarily and get a INC


[02-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I think it would be better  if I kept it and buy the parts for the INC


[02-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^ not too much reason to tear it down if its working well


[02-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I'm only using it to make PT ,And they only have two STL


[02-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Feel free to post ads for the parts! I have some of them already, and can re-arrange my queue


[02-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	did someone need PG?


[02-Oct-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I wasn't asking, but I might be interested


[02-Oct-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I don't normally sell it but I've put a second polymer dodad in and now I'm drowning in the stuff


[02-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how much do you have, and what price are you looking for?


[02-Oct-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	well I could probably sell upto 450 and not worry too much


[02-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I have the mats to make a 3D printer but I'm just not sure how useful those products are right now


[02-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm definitely looking for 12x PSL, and I suspect @dragonican is as well


[02-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	...maybe


[02-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	hmm maybe I should build it then


[02-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im probably going to get mine from parafort though, unless you have a silly-low price


[02-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ah for a core module - yeah I suspect I should branch out onto another planet myself.


[02-Oct-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	OK I finally built it


[02-Oct-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	woohoo


[02-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	let us know when you have a price for PSL :)


[02-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	which will deplete my free PG a little but I'm guessing you needed the PG for the PSL


[02-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I actually needed it for LSE


[02-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	but I also don't know if I can afford as much as I need at the moment


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I've set it off doing 3 lots of 4 but it ain't quick - going to see what I can do with some expert jiggling - take that whatever way you want :D


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	:P


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	actually, I'm in like 15k of debt


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	:O


[02-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so... maybe I shoudn't be buying


[02-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	it'll be fine. I have twice that in BSE waiting to sell at the CX, and plenty of time before it's due


[02-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	you got your own PP2?


[02-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah, all us new players have been scaling hard during your vacation XD


[02-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we are hardly new anymore though


[02-Oct-21 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, I've been running 4x PP2 for a while


[02-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	according to my base list, I built my first one 30 days ago :O


[02-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	gawd I can't be arsed to scale out that much - i suspect if I start a carbon thing I'll have to go wide or go home


[02-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	but for now I've stopped at 2


[02-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	a carbon thing?


[02-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm also running some SMEs, so I'd be very interested in a local supplier of carbon


[02-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm considering a second base to farm carbon on prom or something like that


[02-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah


[02-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	rather than hyf-ing it here


[02-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I too would like cheaper carbon


[02-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	my second base is going to be on Deimos, and I'm planning to truck in my own ALO and O


[02-Oct-21 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	nice


[02-Oct-21 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you sure you wont smelt the ALO on Deimos? or is that what youre sayin


[02-Oct-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	that's probably the long-term plan, but I already have the SMEs up here


[02-Oct-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so in the short term, just hauling ore


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the 6 ALO and the 3 AL it turns into both weigh the same, so its not too much of an issue ^^


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	however, metallurgy COGC on deimos


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	4 AL. I use flux :)


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	but yeah, the COGC is a factor


[02-Oct-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im dumb, i didnt even read the whole page. of course you should use FLX


[02-Oct-21 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	COGC is actually huge, it already sounds good at "25% efficiency" but when you realize that makes you get experts faster and then the experts multiply with the COGC


[02-Oct-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	How do you make your RAT's dragon?


[02-Oct-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i buy all the stuff to make them, just like a BMP


[02-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	From where?


[02-Oct-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the cx, prom, individuals. im trying to arrange a trade-group to "solve" RAT/DW prices and let each player utilize their COGC


[02-Oct-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if you plan to throw up lots of FP on Avalon, i can help you find the materials you need

[02-Oct-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	oh? i dont know much about making carbon


[02-Oct-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you could still just buy what you need on CX


[02-Oct-21 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	anyone need flux? got 10 for sale


[02-Oct-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	they definitely do, if you put up the ad im sure itll get picked up


[02-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	wow, looking over the treasury, i didnt realize our debt wasnt *that* bad for the COGC, if im reading things properly


[02-Oct-21 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@kyzekk how much?


[02-Oct-21 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Ah, saw your lm ad


[02-Oct-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	Thank you!


[02-Oct-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@msorange it was I who asked about PG; I'm starting to use a lot of it. But I did just buy 500 on the CX.


[02-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	If you throw some up on the LM I'm sure it will sell


[02-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im always catching myself low on PG ^^

**lordcirth**:	Yeah. I started making LSE and also NL, so PG is vanishing fast


[02-Oct-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if you started making PG, i dont think you could cover all of our needs, i think we avalonians eat a fair bit


[02-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	116k is a fair bit to me, but not much for a planet, yeah


[02-Oct-21 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	in comparison to the last few tax rates, its "nothing". one term of 40 production taxes would probably generate ~95k


[02-Oct-21 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we could also take it slow, but i find im beginning to believe we should build more SST without delay


[02-Oct-21 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so that we can pay cheaper upkeep overall, and never fall behind on growth


[02-Oct-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Better to have 2 SST on DW, than one on DW+OFF, long term?


[02-Oct-21 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep! thats the entire idea, i dont have anything else to say in support XD


[02-Oct-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Makes sense. DW is ~40 and OFF is ~100. Are they used at the same rate for the same effect?


[02-Oct-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	not same rate, yes same effect


[02-Oct-21 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	5 DW = 3 OFF


[02-Oct-21 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	(3*100)/(5*40) = 1.5


[02-Oct-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	50DW = 30OFF = 9SUN


[02-Oct-21 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	(9*300)/(50*40) = 1.35 ... does that mean SUN is actually more cost-effective than OFF, or is my math wrong


[02-Oct-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	let me check historical auctions and see what things went for


[02-Oct-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	couldnt find any solid numbers in the Prom archives, might just be momentary price blips *shrug*


[02-Oct-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah, I'm just going by CXP, which could be off


[02-Oct-21 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I need 800 PG if your selling


[02-Oct-21 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Kk. I'm not sure exactly what I need, but I'll post ads on the Avalon lm and your can grab them if you have space

[03-Oct-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Greetings!


[03-Oct-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	I didn't realize that you could spend x2 the amount as normal for C and get 3x the yield.  Gonna have to look into that!


[03-Oct-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Might not need a second inci afterall.


[03-Oct-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	well, you aren't really getting 3x the yield. You are burning more crops to get your 4C faster. Just HCP, and it takes 27 hours. HCP + GRN or MAI, and it's 18 hours. HCP + GRN + MAI, and it's 9 hours. (4+2+2)


[03-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	That's what I meant, yea.


[03-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	the cost ends up being almost the same though


[03-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	because where you spend more on materials, you spend less on worker consumption


[03-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	C is selling well now, so pumping out C 3x as fast is well worth the extra crop costs


[03-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Gonna be keeping it all to myself :)


[03-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	better to over-produce. That way you can make some extra money on it


[03-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	well, I plan to open a second BMP, which will need the extra C.  We'll see how it goes for now though :)


[03-Oct-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	well, with 1 INC running with full crops, you can turn out about 11 C/day. So that should more than cover 2 BMP's


[03-Oct-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	:) :) :)


[03-Oct-21 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Just going to run 2 for now and see how it goes.


[03-Oct-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Not like I'm losing money storing the extra C anyway


[03-Oct-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no, but you can be selling the extra, making more money, and expanding faster.


[03-Oct-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	That's the plan. :)


[03-Oct-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Do you need C? :)


[03-Oct-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	no, I make plenty on Montem


[03-Oct-21 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Okies.

**RayKowalchuk**:	Which candidate for governor is running on an anti-capitalist platform?


[03-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I think PrUn should become a basic income simulator.


[03-Oct-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Victor Hugo said there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. (Or was it Hugo Weaving? Elrond?)


[03-Oct-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	By "now" (whatever year it is) shouldn't we have sorted out the whole "earn a living" thing? Why does one have to pay the master for the right to live?


[03-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well, I'm not aware of an option to give our workers ownership in our companies.


[03-Oct-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Other than Eve online this is the only other game that I can use my very rusty Excel skills


[03-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	That's a very interesting idea for a future development, @lordcirth. Once the fun of building our capitalism from scratch is fleshed out in all dimensions, walk it back to ask the fundamental question -- does prosperity make a happy universe when it's unequal?


[03-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I'll be an overlord by then, so I'll certainly chage my mind.


[03-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	sorry raykowalchuk, i dont think either candidate is right for you XD im running on purely market principles

[03-Oct-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and i think you got the recipe wrong? its 4 HCP, not 4 MAI


[03-Oct-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Is anyone here making NL.IC1 that they would be willing to part with?


[03-Oct-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	how much NL do you use? i could run my WPL on NL for like a week


[03-Oct-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I am making NL with ~50% of a WPL. it's not fast


[03-Oct-21 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But I do have 2 you could buy now


[03-Oct-21 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I can post 2 @ 2000ea?


[03-Oct-21 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ad is up


[03-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Thanks! I'm making LFabs for my second base, so I'll need two more at some point but not ongoing


[03-Oct-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I'm also making lfabs, but I have 24hr+ of contracted work before I can start making LDE anyway


[03-Oct-21 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	would it be of use if i ran NL 100% on a WPL? ive been making COT but not really using it up recently, preferring OVE for ease of buffer


[03-Oct-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Considering that NL is at 2000, and LDE is still the most profitable thing I can make, I think that would be great for everyone


[03-Oct-21 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I just changed mine to 100% NL


[03-Oct-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if anyone would be willing to sell me 200 PG, i could get started right away; the payment would come in ~12 hours though

[03-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	they went to sleep recently, so probably wont get lucky. its ok though, no losses from it


[03-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, yeah


[03-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-21 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	14,625.8 ICA with current prices


[03-Oct-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Good to help Avalon but I'm not so sure about profit


[03-Oct-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	A full ship of plants?


[03-Oct-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	All but 2T


[03-Oct-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	whats the profit for an inc daily for you then?


[03-Oct-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	3,300 I think


[03-Oct-21 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Minus the worker upkeep


[03-Oct-21 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	that sounds realy good to me


[03-Oct-21 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if youre over 1000 profit a day after you subtract all the upkeeps, youre in a good spot


[03-Oct-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	The only thing I haven't figured out is how much is costs for repairs, basic consumables And luxury consumables etc.


[03-Oct-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	on my calculation an INC gives me 2k a day at max speeds


[03-Oct-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	with 4 resource ext experts


[03-Oct-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	What recipe are you using?


[03-Oct-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	max speeds so the 8plants


[03-Oct-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	hmm I forgot about expert bonuses


[03-Oct-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	In that case I don't have any ext experts


[03-Oct-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Regardless I only wanted to figure out how much plants I could fit in a ship and how much that will cost

**lordcirth**:	Can't?


[03-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Is 3/day the minimum?


[03-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lordcirth**:	@thejeffcooper, so ~13hr flight?


[04-Oct-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I actually realized that I'm running out of inputs, so I flew it faster. arriving at HRT 5h33m from now


[04-Oct-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	oh wow ok


[04-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Buying COF on LM


[04-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I do need 2x more NL at some point if one of you fine WPLers has some to spare


[04-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I accidentally deleted my LM buy ad this morning in a sleepy stupor


[04-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i started my NL production a few hours ago


[04-Oct-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	is it spoken for?


[04-Oct-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no


[04-Oct-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	2k each okay? that's what I paid someone (@lordcirth?) last night


[04-Oct-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yup


[04-Oct-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	cool, posting


[04-Oct-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah, I sold for 2k earlier

**thejeffcooper**:	posted


[04-Oct-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Probably not selling any more so long as LDE continues so high


[04-Oct-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	21 hours


[04-Oct-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	cool. do you need the money now or is payment on delivery okay?


[04-Oct-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you dont need to pay until then


[04-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	If anyone needs bfabs, just post on the LM - it doesn't make sense to post sells, as people need specific amounts


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyone want 350 PE?


[04-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Not really, but I could take it if you need quick cash


[04-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Not really it's just excess


[04-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i need it


[04-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if youre good with passing it to someone who will use it within a few days ^^


[04-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	My mistake I think it's actually 21


[04-Oct-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	It seems the LDE shortage got overcorrected, but the other lfabs rebounded from their crashes, too


[04-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	carbon prices continue to piss me off


[04-Oct-21 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I think it will drop - several people building new INCs


[04-Oct-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	H prices pissed me off, though, crashing from 70 to 50 just after I bought a shipload to resell


[04-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But that was a fallback plan anyway, just didn't want the ship travelling empty

[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	61.4k

**TheSmithAries**:	I don't think I need my second BMP


[04-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I was hoping it would let me produce double pe and apparently I cant


[04-Oct-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyway anyone have three hydrogen I could buy?


[04-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Exactly 3? lol I could do that


[04-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Apparently I didn't have enough hydrogen because now both BMPs are making PE


[04-Oct-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I'm going to be honest I don't like manufacturing


[04-Oct-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Pleinair**:	H is easy.. its the C that kills you


[04-Oct-21 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Maybe instead of the incinerator I should've got a second pp1


[04-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I am just a little concerned about Putting all that money and resources into something That could be rendered useless if the market crashess


[04-Oct-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	with 4 differen bfabs, you have some flexiblilty; it's unlikely that they will all crash and stay crashed


[04-Oct-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But I do end up constantly shifting my queues to match the market.


[04-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone have cargo from HRT?


[04-Oct-21 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	HRT -> Avalon that is


[04-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Avalon -> HRT, 6h burn, leaving in 15m


[04-Oct-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Mostly empty


[04-Oct-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Am I correct in assuming that since Avalon's single Safety Station has "0/0" next to the upkeep inventory items DW OFF & SUN that the first Safety Station doesn't need upkeep? I can contribute SUN and OFF...if they are needed, and aren't going to sit perpetually in Reserve.


[04-Oct-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm leaving HRT for avalon right now


[04-Oct-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@raykowalchuk I think that's just because no upkeep tick has yet occurred


[04-Oct-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I thought you were also sending a ship


[04-Oct-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	they did


[04-Oct-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	@lordcirth - "upkeep tick?" Sounds awful...invasive even


[04-Oct-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	They thought you were asking about cargo space, not packages


[04-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah


[04-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I have too many different kinds of things for it to be worth shipping


[04-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	*shipping on someone else's ship


[04-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	yeah, me too most of the time


[04-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I sent 100 PWO and 100 OVE as packages, but 4-8 different prefabs, not so much


[04-Oct-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	@raykowalchuk i dont think we will need more than DW for the SST for now, so the SUN and OFF arent necessary at the moment


[04-Oct-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	And as Dragonican and I were discussing earlier, it would be cheaper long-term to build a second tier of SST and run it on DW, than to supply higher goods


[04-Oct-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	after our budget stablizes and we have concluded the SST 1 and COGC, i will advocate for an immediate SST2


[04-Oct-21 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well, POPR is in 1.5d, so we should clearly see what's needed


[04-Oct-21 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the SST will turn on in 1.5d, and we will see its effects in the POPR 7 days later


[04-Oct-21 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i dont see any responsibilities of the govt outside planetary projects and POPI. avalon will soon have built all relevant projects, meaning the Govt just needs to maintain COGC and build POPI. at that point, the question simply becomes "which POPI next"


[04-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I don't know what you're talking about. we could build a SHY to show Avalon's true greatness


[04-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	(should we? that wasn't the question)


[04-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	maybe we can build a SHY after we hit lvl 10 in all POPI and are tech capital of the world :)


[04-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	*universe


[04-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	:)


[04-Oct-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think planetary improvements should be viewed from a "build order" approach, like an rts. we decide in which order things should be done, and then execute each step as soon as we are able


[04-Oct-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	that makes it tricky to respond to changing conditions, though


[04-Oct-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	which we are insulated from, but not 100%


[04-Oct-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	which changing conditions?


[04-Oct-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	like hypothetically if market conditions changed so that we decide we want to prioritize settler happiness over attracting technicians


[04-Oct-21 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ok, I didn't realize the effect would be delayed by another week. Still, that will probably come before the debt being gone, right?


[04-Oct-21 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	settler happiness leads to technicians, you wouldnt quite choose between them. there are talks of avoiding having PIO or SET to get to high tech which avoids certain mechanics, but i believe a linear approach would put us in a safe position


[04-Oct-21 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	@lordcirth a maximum of 120k is about to be paid out to two auctions on wednesday


[04-Oct-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i predict our planetary balance will be 0, +- 20k by the next wednesday where we see the effects of the SST


[04-Oct-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	hey all, theres still 2 PE and 2 MCG lots in the auctions that havent been bid on yet. go gettem!

[04-Oct-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I make my own, but I can buy if you are in a pinch


[04-Oct-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Well, maybe. I'm a little tight rn myself :P


[04-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	the government is!


[04-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	This is true, you can bid on the PE lots


[04-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Unless you can't wait a few days


[04-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	um


[04-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	is that for Avalon?


[04-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, I do


[04-Oct-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	you just need one of each?


[04-Oct-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	You wouldn't happen also have any MCG?


[04-Oct-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how many?


[04-Oct-21 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	33


[04-Oct-21 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	And yes one each of the other two


[04-Oct-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, I have the MCG


[04-Oct-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	if not, I'll buy REP or PT


[04-Oct-21 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Can I sell you 1 PT?


[04-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	not gonna pick it up until tomorrow. my workers are on strike 🙃


[04-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	which is to say, production is halted until my ship arrives


[04-Oct-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	mistimed your supply deliveries?


[04-Oct-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	More like I was so focused on one input that I didn't realize I would run out of the other so soon


[04-Oct-21 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Adding another PP1


[04-Oct-21 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I think I miscalculated I need another 50 ICA


[04-Oct-21 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Have FE prices come down? I switched from pp1 to pp2 during the iron storage a few weeks ago l


[04-Oct-21 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Ah. I'll buy a few LST if you have them?


[04-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Unfortunately I only have Bfabs


[04-Oct-21 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Which ones? I'll buy back my BBH on a delay if you can replace it within a few days


[04-Oct-21 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Let's say 1000 ICA now if you get me that BBH back in the next 5 days?


[04-Oct-21 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I can give you two PT


[04-Oct-21 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	That works too


[04-Oct-21 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	800 ICA?


[04-Oct-21 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Sure, if you post the ad


[04-Oct-21 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I have a ship of LST incoming, but it's all spoken for. Another run soon


[04-Oct-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Cool. I'll likely want some of the next run


[04-Oct-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can buy from the CX until then


[04-Oct-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	umm should I be concerned about not enough workers?


[04-Oct-21 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	As in, you just built a new building and it's understaffed?


[04-Oct-21 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Low worker population is why we built the SST, but it will take some time to kick in


[04-Oct-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You'll make stuff slower, but also use less consumables. Only building degradation still happens at the full rate


[04-Oct-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	any "not enough workers" problems you have will likely be solved in 30h


[05-Oct-21 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Whoa...I didn't even look at the currency for the shipping contracts on the LM...just happened to pick them from the top and got the ICA contracts. I would have had to go on a shopping trip...


[05-Oct-21 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	anyone interested in CAF at 600 here? my fp game is so weak i cant process this silly bean t-t


[05-Oct-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@yesplease you have a bunch of shipping contracts on the LM in non-ICA currencies. is that intentional?


[05-Oct-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Probably, they've done it before


[05-Oct-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	CAF needs to be sold for 500 to reasonably compete with the super low prices rn,  but idk if youre willing to sell there


[05-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	leaving avalon -> hrt in a few minutes. 6t / 400m3 left if anyone has something light


[05-Oct-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	when are we getting a chamber of commerce to support the pioneer population?


[05-Oct-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we probably wont be voting PIO, and it looks like as soon as some guy named Dover delivers 8 LTA we will be done


[05-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	CoGC should go Food Industries, PIO is bad for everyone


[05-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I say this as someone who has 0 FI buildings.


[05-Oct-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	However, I believe the first week of CoGC is PIO automatically?


[05-Oct-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep, but we also dont intend to pay for it


[05-Oct-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	also, POPR is in about 18 hours, if you were delaying buildings bc youre out of PIO please throw them up before POPR. the open job bonus will help our growth, plus youll get the PIO you want without subtracting from your buffer for next week


[05-Oct-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	BTW, If you can afford it, its always good to throw up the buildings you need workers for right away. The whole week counts to the open job growth bonus, not just right before the POPR


[05-Oct-21 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	do pop mechanics actually happen between reports? i was under the understanding it was only the weekly tick


[05-Oct-21 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Do you mean that the open jobs are averaged across the week?


[05-Oct-21 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	on the other hand, those buildings will also start to wear even if they're not fully staffed


[05-Oct-21 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	(I think?)


[05-Oct-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yes, they degrade. But that's a later problem :P


[05-Oct-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Btw jeff, I just dispatched my second ship for more LST


[05-Oct-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	thats why desan said if you can afford it ^^


[05-Oct-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	oh cool, thanks. what's the ETA on that LST shipment?


[05-Oct-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	~3d


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Yes according to one of the Devs, the whole week counts


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	interesting


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No need to do that for settlers, even though I'm a few short, because we have 7.4% unemployment?


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah, our SET should be fine, we have a buffer to float us till the SST turns on


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Does my reserve scale with my jobs, or just even across all bases?


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I have 300 PIO beds, all full, and 305 PIO jobs. Doesn't seem worth building another HB1 unless I'm going to make more jobs, and my next building is SET only


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Anyone selling AL locally?


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how much and what timeline?


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	well your habitats don't degrade so building them ahead of time isn't an issue


[05-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yes, and I'm going to build an HB2 very soon. But sinking money into an idle building is still a form of waste.


[05-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@thejeffcooper about 30? I'll be out in about 2d


[05-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	hmm, I don't think I'll have that much spare. My ship of ALO gets back in ~2d, then I have to build more SMEs


[05-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sorry!


[05-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the reserve is 10% of all new workers + all previously unemployed workers. thats per person


[05-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ok, thanks


[05-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Np jeff, I'll buy on CX

**Dragonican**:	whats up with all the weird currencies on LM?


[05-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I guess some people have more than one base


[05-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	for sure, its just weird to trade in non-ICA on a planet in-system with HRT cx


[05-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Probably trying to offload the currency


[05-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^^ my thoughts


[05-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	trick a poor soul into taking your CIS :(

**thejeffcooper**:	I need about 300 CIS


[05-Oct-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone have some they want to offload in exchange for RAT/DW/something?


[05-Oct-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you can have all 0 of mine


[05-Oct-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	great, I'll give you 0 DW for it


[05-Oct-21 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im going to have a WPL running NL non-stop, so you PP2 guys can ask whenever


[05-Oct-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yay


[05-Oct-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ad up for 1 PT at the low low price of 375 CIS


[05-Oct-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone who wants to get rid of some of their starter CIS to get a free PT (currently valued at PT.IC1 )


[05-Oct-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Would anyone be interested in C if i put it up on the LM?


[05-Oct-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah


[05-Oct-21 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Desan**:	I need PT and EXO, anyone that can sell me in bulk?


[05-Oct-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Define bulk


[05-Oct-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I could dedicate a BMP to either for a day or so


[05-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I have 30 EXO


[05-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	and can also dedicate my BMP to EXO for a day as well


[05-Oct-21 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	Greetings.


[05-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JaoriMelkins**:	would be helpful if one could search the chat.  Not sure if someone answered to me asking about C.  :/


[05-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Okay 30 EXO sounds good


[05-Oct-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	would take up to 50


[05-Oct-21 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	same goes for PT


[05-Oct-21 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	if price is right =D


[05-Oct-21 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You're out of ALO?


[06-Oct-21 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, until my full shipload arrives in 18h


[06-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	You could smelt FE -> STL?


[06-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	If you have a lot of oxygen


[06-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I don't have any FE. I also don't really mind having a little bit of idle time. it's not ideal, but it's not the end of the world either


[06-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	if you have the O, I'll trade you 4 FE for 2 STL


[06-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	has anyone got a link to that site that lets you search for planets?


[06-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	the PSL should be done in 26 hours btw


[06-Oct-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'll also have ~70 FEO in a few days.. someone else is shipping that, so I don't know when


[06-Oct-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	nice - depends on your price but I may well take some off your hands because the price at market is pissing me off :D


[06-Oct-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I need to go move to the perfect ALO and C planet :D


[06-Oct-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	hmmm can I take 30 of the ALO and 12 FEO


[06-Oct-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Nevermind can't afford it


[06-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sorry, had a meeting. for ALO, is 110/u good? That's a ~25% discount vs current asking price on the CX, plus I deliver (to Avalon only)


[06-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@msorange @kyzekk


[06-Oct-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Unless someone wants 2 BDE


[06-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'll take some - it'll work out cheaper than flying somewhere :)


[06-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	How many do you want?


[06-Oct-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Was that in reference to the ALO or the FEO?


[06-Oct-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Also, same price for FEO (@kyzekk)


[06-Oct-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	For the FEO I can't promise a better timeline than 6d, though I suspect it'll be here much sooner


[06-Oct-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ALO will be here in 13h, and I'll be awake a few hours after that to unload it


[06-Oct-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ALO mostly - FEO is luxury for when I setting that ALO and C planet ;)


[06-Oct-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	cool, how much?


[06-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	when will auctions be closed?

**thejeffcooper**:	please do


[07-Oct-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ooo just going to put a smallish add up as someone actually fulfilled my CX order - so I'll stick with 24 for now - but will no doubt be back for more :D


[07-Oct-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	sounds good :)


[07-Oct-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm planning to have a relatively steady supply in the near future


[07-Oct-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'll concentrate on my Carbon Campaign then :D  seeing as SmartDog is manipulating the price :P


[07-Oct-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm off out to a goth festival tonigh - your PSL will be ready in 5 hours - I may remember to fulfil it whilst drunk when I get back in

**thejeffcooper**:	do you still want ALO?


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yup


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	how much?


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	how much FLX you need?


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	because I dont have alot of money curently


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I think what you just sold me is good for the moment (I'm also short on cash), but I've got a ship full of stuff to sell arriving at the CX tonight


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	ah


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	alrighty


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	If you expect money coming in, I can make it a longer contract for only a small fee :)


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ie, I can deliver now and you can have a while to pay


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	nah I have nothing but the FLX to sale for right now


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	waiting to fill up my ship


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	once my cash situation stabilizes I'm probably good for at least 40 FLX


[07-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	and then probably more on an ongoing basis, since I'm running a bunch of SMEs


[07-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Anyonne have 16 hydrogen?


[07-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	how much?


[07-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'll need some space on my ship, but not a ton


[07-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	er, not a lot. more than 1t :P


[07-Oct-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	1.12?


[07-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I was worried you were going to want a whole 500m^3 of H or something


[07-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Would you like to wait till you get there for the contract or do you want to do it now


[07-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can take the contract now


[07-Oct-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	that way I don't forget


[07-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	How much do you want?


[07-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	we can do the standard rate of 4/t with a minimum of 100 ICA?


[07-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so I guess that would be 100ICA, since you're shipping a small amount


[07-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	So 100 ICA?


[07-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yep


[07-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	I think I did it right?


[07-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	you did!


[07-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got your shipment, and I'll bring it back with me


[07-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	not sure on an exact ETA, but should be within 24h


[07-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	depends on your price. Buying in multiples of 35


[07-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	Unfortunately I think I may have 21 PE I can sell


[07-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah, oh well. no worries


[07-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@talmar do you have the LST you listed on hand?


[07-Oct-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	anyone have any FEO?


[07-Oct-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I will in a few days. not sure exactly how many; still waiting to hear from the shipper


[07-Oct-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	ah


[07-Oct-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	ok


[07-Oct-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	wooo I only have 1 ICA


[07-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**sdlouisee**:	anyone need anything shipped back from hrt? I have room still for 500m3/500t


[07-Oct-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Regardless, just posted 3 packages for whoever


[07-Oct-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	nevermind ship has left


[07-Oct-21 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	please accept the contracts that you won, and post a sell ad for 1 DW with the total amount I owe you respectively


[07-Oct-21 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I have not sent messages detailing how much the govenrment owes the winners, I will do so tomorrow in case the ads are not of the correct amount!


[07-Oct-21 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	congratulations to all the winners, here's to more successful future auctions!


[07-Oct-21 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Furthermore, I'd like to resuest that you post the sell ads for DW with a time period of at least 1 week so I can gather the money to pay you


[07-Oct-21 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	if you feel like giving the government a deadline of 20 days to repay you, that would very much be appreciated!


[07-Oct-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah, Dragonican was pointing out that a second SST using only DW would be more cost effective than using DW+OFF on our one.


[07-Oct-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Presumably after a few levels that stops being the case.


[07-Oct-21 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Yes, why are you putting things up for AIC? we don't use that shit here


[07-Oct-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	results for the previous 2 procurements are out already


[07-Oct-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I've posted the contracts for the winners


[07-Oct-21 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	In the meantime, I'd like to take in ideas on what we should procure next. I believe Dragonican wanted to build a nother upgrade to our SST?


[07-Oct-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	keep in mind that we'll be paying at least 30K or more in tax income to IKO for their loan for our eletcornics


[07-Oct-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yes, i think that after debts have been settled, another SST should be the next thing we look at


[07-Oct-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and we should also probably take a vote for how aggressively Avalon should tax in the long term; enough to sustain upkeeps, enough to build a POPI every month, or various points in between


[07-Oct-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	For reference, could someone calculate what the upkeep would work out to in fees?


[07-Oct-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	not really; we can only guess how much of the recent tax week was contributed from production fees, and go from there


[07-Oct-21 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	mm, i guess if someone used FIO, they could count how much were paid in LM and WAR fees, and then guess how many building/days were run during the tax cycle. but even then, amount of BUI on Avalon will change


[07-Oct-21 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	Anybody need ALO? I've got plenty but I need cash


[07-Oct-21 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	or does anyone need AL?


[07-Oct-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	how much for 10 AL ?


[07-Oct-21 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	AL.IC1


[07-Oct-21 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	450/u ?


[07-Oct-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	425


[07-Oct-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ugh, just looked and I don't actually have any on hand. I have 15 available in 5.5h, but I'll be asleep then


[07-Oct-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I can do 410/u if you can wait 12h for delivery


[07-Oct-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	OK. put the order up and i can pay now


[07-Oct-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	awesome. thanks!


[07-Oct-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	posted


[07-Oct-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	no worries


[07-Oct-21 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, anyone need anything brought back from the CX?


[07-Oct-21 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Argh, I keep forgetting to enable autoprovision on my sell ads


[07-Oct-21 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I didn't think you could do that


[08-Oct-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	autoprovision is only on shipping ads


[08-Oct-21 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	okay! I should have contracts signed with everyone except @MsOrange


[08-Oct-21 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	furthermore, the L-fab suppliers just passed me the L-fabs yesterday morning, and my ships picked it up yesterday night. It's making its journey down to Hortus now!


[08-Oct-21 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Oct-21 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Who was selling Flux?


[08-Oct-21 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MsOrange**:	ah well I'd be interested in buying some if the price is right :D


[08-Oct-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, anyone need bfabs or lfabs? I've got a stock of basically everything


[08-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@yesplease why import lfabs to avalon from outside Hortus? I thought we had good prices here


[08-Oct-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its who won the bid, i believe


[08-Oct-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	oh, ok


[08-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	is anyone looking for FEO?


[08-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I just got a bunch delivered to HRT. Figured I'd ask here if anyone wants it before putting it on the CX


[08-Oct-21 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No, but if you want to smelt it, I might buy FE


[08-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSmithAries**:	anyone have COF for sale


[08-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Oct-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, I don't get any direct benefit from FI, so I hope y'all will make good on cheap RAT/DW being available :)


[11-Oct-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I'm planning to pivot if it wins, but none yet


[11-Oct-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TheSmithAries**:	Off we go


[11-Oct-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so, to give everyone the rundown on the SST coming into effect on wednesday: we have only fed it DW, so its operating at 1/3 power. due to the moving average effect, it will only have 40% influence on the displayed values. so, i expect our PIO needs to still be mainly met, but feeding it super cheap DW will keep our PIO growth strong for a while longer


[11-Oct-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Do you mean it will be 40% of  1/3?


[11-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep


[11-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the weight-amounts are 0.4, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05

**Dragonican**:	week 1, 40%, week 2, 65%, week 3, 85%. its pretty close to full effect by week 3


[11-Oct-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think i actually might have made an error... checking this with the professionals


[11-Oct-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the alternative is "safety isnt averaged and will show in full effect on wednesday"


[11-Oct-21 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yeah... scratch the average thing. does not apply for safety


[11-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	oh, nice


[11-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	however, the happiness from the increased safety will follow the above average


[11-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if that makes sense


[11-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah. So does the safety increase actually do anything other than the happiness, anyway?


[11-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I guess it matters for health capping?


[11-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	health and safety are on the same tier and dont cap each other


[11-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its mostly all about happiness, but happiness is very important


[11-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Oh ok. I thought it was all in order


[11-Oct-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	So what should the safety % be wednesday? And the happiness?


[11-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	its near impossible to estimate, given we dont have a good indicator of how many PIO jobs opened up etc.


[11-Oct-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	what i could tell you on wednesday is what our true happiness is, and estimate how many more PIOs we could support


[11-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the 4 tiers are: (Life Support) ( Safety & Health) (Comfort & Culture) (Education) btw


[11-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I see


[11-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But we do expect the safety % increase to be significant?


[11-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	no, as in less than 10%


[11-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Hmm. Thus your recommendation of a 2nd tier of SST immediately?


[11-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i recommend we continue to build POPI as there is nothing else the govt money should go to, and the quicker the SST the more we save on consumables.


[11-Oct-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	given the knowledge we have on POPI, a "build order" approach to POPI seems suitable. one comes after the other, as soon as possible


[11-Oct-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah. Though I believe we have debt owed first.


[11-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yes, my exact proposition was "SST2 right after the debt is paid"


[11-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we will need to debate how agressively we should tax to construct POPI, though it seems pretty simple what the govt should do with the collected tax money


[11-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	right. Do you think it may be worth using OFF in the meantime, if we still have open jobs after POPR?


[11-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	open jobs actually shows how many were open the moment before the growth tick


[11-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Oh, that's misleading


[11-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	we had ~2310 excess PIO as the POPR finished


[11-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	What about unemployment %?


[11-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	unemployment is before growth, and affects how much we grow by


[11-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Does the excess include reserve?


[11-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	excess = reserve * 10


[11-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	they are directly related


[11-Oct-21 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	this is only the case when theres not a shortage... if we run out of PIO, PIO will be "stolen" from some players and put in the pool


[11-Oct-21 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	well, i think if PIO starts getting stolen then there is no excess...


[11-Oct-21 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so excess = reserve * 10 should always be true


[11-Oct-21 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Hmm, ok. I thought there was a reserve even if we were short


[11-Oct-21 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	there will always be at least 1 in reserve, due to some rounding stuff :)


[11-Oct-21 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	montem has been dealing with no reserve due to lack of PIO


[11-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Hmm. Are they trying to build SST's too?


[11-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yes, i think they built 2 SST in the first week the problem occurred


[11-Oct-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i think i forgot to say this aloud, but to answer an earlier question, last POPR we consumed 9325.05 safety. an SST with only DW provides 833.33 safety. i think that should put the increase into perspective?


[11-Oct-21 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yes, that does help, thanks.


[11-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	Safety is .25 of a PIO's total happiness, so 10% safety increase = 2.5% happiness increase for a PIO


[11-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	and the big number is keeping Happiness about 3-4% abouve 71% at a minimum, imo


[11-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ah, because migration is relative to 70%, right?


[11-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yep, and about 1.5% of PIO will educate to settler, modified by SET happiness


[11-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	so staying a bit above that break point will keep the new PIOs coming in.

[13-Oct-21 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I have 200 total 83 for the LST and 117 for the 2574

**Maces**:	@thejeffcooper yes, you did, thanks


[14-Oct-21 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I just accepted a contract for 2 more. I'll have one more a few hours after that, but no more


[14-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	shutting down my PP2s for a few days


[14-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	okay, I'm gambling my company on this venture, but I've just launched a ship with all the supplies for a mining base on deimos


[14-Oct-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I should be back to avalon in about a week with a full shipload of ALO


[14-Oct-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	and in theory with another full shipload every ~5 days after that


[15-Oct-21 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Altura16**:	If you are going to EXT ALO on Deimos then maybe you should SME it there as well.


[15-Oct-21 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	^ i think hauling the AL instead would make for a denser shipment. youd also get to use the metallurgy COGC on Deimos

**Helter5**:	Planing ahead for my next base, what would be better in the long run. Moria on Mortem or Vallis, lesser farming but FEO and H/LST, or going local and Promitor, great farming but only later game HAL and N?


[15-Oct-21 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Helter5**:	Leaning towards Promitor, C is high in both systems and with DW och RAT at high enough degree i would be self sustaining.


[15-Oct-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	My plan long term is to smelt on Deimos too, but short term I can't afford it


[15-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	LST is up on the LM for 6 below CXP. Go get it


[15-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	It's been a little crashy today. I wonder if they're doing server work


[15-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ah yeah they're restarting soon good because everyone was turning into 'hydration timeout'


[15-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-21 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	@yesplease Why do you keep spamming the LM with ads for AIC? or some other money, instead of ICA? No one wants that crap money here.

**Altura16**:	and he/she is the Governor !!!


[16-Oct-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	He's probably trying to dump that shit, and hopes no one will notice, and take the contract.


[16-Oct-21 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	*shrug* I had the free space, so I took it


[16-Oct-21 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	why are you all so worked up about it tho?


[16-Oct-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I post ads in AIC, because I use ICA to float the Government debt


[16-Oct-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so I end up with a surplus of AIC and a shortage of ICA


[16-Oct-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Like, if you want to take the MAG shipping ads and need payment in ICA, you can let me know and I'll post an ad specifically for you


[16-Oct-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	but if people are good with AIC then it's free market time babey


[16-Oct-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'm aware that some people use AIC to import things like ALO from Antares, am I wrong on that front?

[16-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if anybody did, i have questions for them


[16-Oct-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	It seems that the TS here isn't great, but there's no other T1 with it? and most good TS is on double reds


[16-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-21 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Helter5**:	It maybe not as profitable as extracting MAG, but is has more value to other players and therefore more valuable. Also, with "free" FF, trading goods  in moria are now a valuable option

[18-Oct-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I've got a bit of O as well, actually


[18-Oct-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	the shutdown was intentional. I spent all of my cash setting up a second base to provide inputs for this base


[18-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-21 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RayKowalchuk**:	MsOrange is the first person in 542 days of playing to comment that I use palindromic bids and prices. (First to comment...so it's hard to say how many have noticed...and how many have been irritated)


[24-Oct-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I could quit it at any time (he said, uncertainly)

**MsOrange**:	:D


[25-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	so to be clear we're not in an episode of lost then cos I found this dynamite...


[25-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Oh I just realised why it's always so much worse flying avalon <-> promitor - you have to land at both ends


[25-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	which leads to the question is landing / taking cheaper on planets with less gravity?


[25-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Tonight on 'Orange Ponders'


[25-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I think it is


[25-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I DO live in a hatch where I have to push a button on a regular basis for unspecified reasons...the Petula Clark is starting to get a bit cloying.


[25-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(OMG "Downtown was written for Petula Clark by Tony Hatch...the LOST Easter eggs never stop.)


[25-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	There are really only three food producers on Avalon? The CoGC Program "Victuals are our Bread and Butter" is boosting food production by 25% for only me, @StanleyFarms and @HareEnterprises Inc.


[25-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(I have never used the word "victuals" until PrUN; haven't yet met a self-identified "victualler" IRL)


[25-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	it's a pleasingly archaic word :)


[25-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	bugger I missed the HRT to Avalon shippings - just left


[25-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	no there are more food produces then just you three


[25-Oct-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	When the message arises: "he Chamber of Global Commerce at Hortus - Avalon started a new economic program: Advertising Campaign: Food Industries." it's not junk mail or fake news. Git on in on the production boost!


[25-Oct-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I've never noticed on the Chamber of Commerce screen under "Command" the link to "programs / vote" which brings up 14 programs. Only Food, Construction, and Pioneers in general have gotten any love (or "influence"). Is the idea that if enough people vote for Chemistry programs they'll start to appear? (The campaign slogan is, "Science is Sexy."


[25-Oct-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	every 7 days the next COGC effect is decided by vote. your influence is determined by the POP you have on the planet


[25-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I've never voted before the ad goes up (before today I didn't know it was possible). The influence only has effect whe you vote, or does it influence the appearance of the Food or Pioneers campaign in our Notifications?


[25-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	"influence" is just an obfuscated election


[25-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just think of it as a bonus we are electing every week?


[25-Oct-21 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I will be knee deep in PG at this rate


[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	what's the done rate for shipping - I've never done a shipping contract


[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	prom -> avalon


[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I think its usually 4 ICA per T or M^3


[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	which ever is larger?  so for 90t -> 360


[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	anyone want to buy BBH or BSE? I have two of each and only 5 ICA, so I can't afford my production fees


[27-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ill take 2 - do they taste like girl scout cookies?  I'm british - we don't have them - I imagine they taste like BSE though


[27-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	BSE or BBH? you'll have to put up the LM ad, since I can't afford the posting fee :|


[27-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	lol


[27-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	how did it come to this


[27-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	810 a piece?


[27-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	wasn't paying attention. I have probably 20k worth of BBH and BSE currently on a ship to the CX, but they don't do much good until they get there


[27-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	for BSE? seems reasonable


[27-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, girl scout cookies taste different depending on where you are! they have two or three different  bakeries across the country


[27-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ad is up be quick


[27-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	and depending on where you are, you get similar but noticeably different cookies under the same name


[27-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	thank you much!


[27-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	ooof


[28-Oct-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i think it should auto sell at the highest bid price


[28-Oct-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Yeah, it will take the best price, but it could still be pretty low

**thejeffcooper**:	iirc it wasn't that much different


[28-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I keep trying to justify teching up, but my spreadsheet keeps saying that a BMP is the most profitable building I can make - and that's before accounting for building cost!


[28-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i think you should do it then, i think teching up comes later when your not thinking much about profit but more of logistics, production chains and synergizing multiple planets


[28-Oct-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I know, but BMP #4 is boring :P

[28-Oct-21 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WordedWheel**:	I imagine when the price went way down they decided to change markets, but so many left it now the price is shooting back up. It was basically at MM for ages


[28-Oct-21 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	changes to the fuel MMs? i dont see it any where on the latest dev blog


[28-Oct-21 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No, no MM changes, just normal price changes


[28-Oct-21 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MsOrange**:	I'm going on holiday til monday - let's see if I can get my production queues sorted :D


[29-Oct-21 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	step 1 - switch extractors to sulphur crystals so they take up less space


[29-Oct-21 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	also - bums my ship comes in 45 minutes after we're supposed to be leaving - timed that one badly :D


[29-Oct-21 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-21 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm sending a super slow flight to HRT :D


[29-Oct-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	@msorange you could keep your extractors doing what they're doing and then set up a bunch of long-duration shipping contracts


[29-Oct-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	with auto-provision


[29-Oct-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm sure a few of us will be heading to HRT between now and the time you get back

**yesplease**:	please get any last minute bids in, so we can properly maintain our infrastructure!


[31-Oct-21 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	we still would need bids for a lot of stuff to build up the stockpile


[31-Oct-21 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	as promised, when our debts were paid off then the taxes would go back to normal levels


[31-Oct-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	it does look like we need an SST expansion soon though, so I will open another procurement after this one closes


[31-Oct-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	should we do DW + OFF on this SST or DW on a level 2 SST?


[31-Oct-21 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	seeing the cost of both DW and OFF at the current time, it looks like OFF upkeep is hardly more expensive than DW upkeep. excess tax income should definitely go towards SST2, but i dont think it would save money compared to our current situation


[01-Nov-21 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	sure, next procurement then


[01-Nov-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	there was Gin and Lemonade before we went out (it was flavoured gin so the tonic would have not been great)


[14-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	then there was a bottle of wine (buy it at the super-busy bar and keep it in your handbag = less time wasted in the bar queue)


[14-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	then someone suggested shots.  Sambucca. followed by sours.  then the wine had gone so I had a couple of pints of cider.


[14-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	then we came home and our guest opened the bottle of prosecco he'd bought along.  all in all I have no idea how I'm not dead - you're not supposed to do all this when you're 50 :D

[15-Nov-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	In September Canada wasn't on high alert so we had a decent party. Just two days ago, a gathering in the same space was dispersed after someone at my niece's play group was diagnosed with COVID. She and her family since tested negative...but the phone call sure killed the party!

[18-Nov-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	yep, there's another procurement up!


[18-Nov-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	for PE, MCG, DW, RAT, and OFF


[18-Nov-21 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	surely, 7 DW lots is a bit excessive? any chance we can switch towards the auction functionality of the UFO bot in the future?


[18-Nov-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	yes UFO bot is sick!

***Zolaire** left.*


[19-Nov-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Does the UFO bot allow flexible bid quantities?


[19-Nov-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@yesplease, the spreadsheet seems borked? The right side of #10 is all black


[19-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ah one for @yesplease - I thought I had ordered what sounded like a mild malaysian curry - I was wrong


[19-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I should know by now that such a thing is unlikely to exist


[19-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	very tasty though and I didn;t die


[19-Nov-21 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	7 DW lots is a lot but it's because the SST X2 and the CoGC eats up DW a lot more tahn other stuff


[19-Nov-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hmm, I'll look into the UFO bot!


[19-Nov-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hahah @MsOrange what was the name of the curry?


[19-Nov-21 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	im just saying id love to bid on 2100 DW at once, and not fill out 7 forms


[19-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	ooof


[19-Nov-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	it seems like you are only allowed to bid once?


[19-Nov-21 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	which is problematic, because the economics of our bidding system requires that the thing gets split into identical lots


[19-Nov-21 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	the next issue is that, you don't get live updates on which lots are currently heavily bid on


[19-Nov-21 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	coz, to my knowledge, you recieve data on all the bids at once?


[19-Nov-21 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so like, although I'm not fundamentally opposed to using UFObot, I'm gonna have to tinker around with it for a bit to figure out how to properly preserve the functionality we have


[19-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you will be informed every time someone submits a bid, and which lot it is on


[19-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	the bot, at its core, just receives a text string, and then displays it after the auction concludes


[19-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hmm, alright then lemme go and test it out


[19-Nov-21 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i also dont quite understand why the lot system is integral to maintain? what major disadvantage would we face upon losing specific lots


[19-Nov-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	it's mostly because of the economics of the thing, since when the original Vickrey paper was written it was for things like


[19-Nov-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	people bidding for an expensive vase


[19-Nov-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I don't know if the same incentives hold up when the thing you're bidding on is continuous, rather than discrete


[19-Nov-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	which is why I went for the lot system, to make teh continuous units of stuff discrete


[19-Nov-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	like, if you want to buy 100 DW, and your bidders bid for 50 DW at 100 ICA, 20 DW at 200 ICA, and 30 DW at 500 ICA, which is the second price?


[19-Nov-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	that's where the logic of the original Vickrey paper, in my limited knowledge, falls apart


[19-Nov-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	hence why lots is integral to the current bidding system


[19-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	anyways


[19-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I have tinkered with UFO bot!


[19-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	so we now have that functionality


[19-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	we will run these two systems in parallel, because they are not mutually exclusive and in fact the UFObot one is still supervenient on the sheet regardless


[19-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	check out https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/855508301080035332/911426561952088104


[19-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MsOrange**:	@yesplease your procurement code is mad - it's incrementing throughout the entire auction so instead of being AP10 for every row each row has the next number


[24-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	but other than that I'm really liking the click through from from the spreadsheet and it filling everything in for me :D


[24-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	also I guess if I win the auction I'll resub :D


[24-Nov-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	gah always check LM Orange!  Always!


[24-Nov-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm so lazy - I resubbed cos I couldn't deal with not having repeating orders on my Promitor base


[24-Nov-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	lol, they are really nice


[24-Nov-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	@MsOrange, are you likely to buy the other 50 anytime soon?


[24-Nov-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	In 3hrs I need to decide whether to dispatch a ship on another LST run for ~4-5d round trip


[24-Nov-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	nope because before I bought that off you I bought a load (including some off you) on the CX so I'm good for a while - 80 should last me for now


[24-Nov-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	k


[24-Nov-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sdlouisee**:	Eventually 8 LSE, 8 LDE and 8 LTA but I won't have the cash for all at once


[24-Nov-21 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Ok, I have 4 LDE, 4 LTA, 2 LSE. So post buys for however much at CXP and I can fulfill immediately.

[29-Nov-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	the Ky and the mid capital letter come from a book I read forever ago. the ek was from a mobile mmo type game where someone called me vtec and I fiddled wiith it and the Z is from one of my previous usernames online. and then fiddled with it and went though different variations till I got to KyZekk


[29-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Also, I think I'll decide not to run for governor this term, life has been too hectic for me now that university is back in person. I'm really sorry if I've been inactive and caused any problems, but on the other hand I do feel like I've achieved all I could and wanted to during my term as Governor. I hope that the new governor does a good job whatever they decide for Avalon!


[30-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Whoever wins, I'll pass them the amount in the treasury as well as any assets procured, and I'll work with them for a smooth transition


[30-Nov-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	Thank you all for having me as your governor!


[30-Nov-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	You've done a good job, yes. Do well in school


[30-Nov-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I suspected Uni was kicking your arse a bit @yesplease - thanks for starting us out on this journey


[30-Nov-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	+1 to all of the above. good luck with school!


[30-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I don't expect the next governor to keep the auction system, but the economics does work when there are more bidders (as seen from the CoGC bidding) and I'm happy to explain how to use the sheet from my end to the next governor


[30-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	But at least, I think the treasury/assets accounts are really important so I'd expect them to keep using those ones


[30-Nov-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I found it pretty good for the last round of auctions - now it's filling in most of the information for you


[30-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'm glad you think so!


[30-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I wish I could google forms magic up a better UI for the auctions, but this is the best I can do


[30-Nov-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	all UFObot does is send you a verified message, so it doesn't actually add much functionality to the thing given that we have the codeword system for verification


[30-Nov-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	ooo smooth - won all the auctions I entered.  go me.  Thanks to Parafort for doubling the money I got for the OFF

**Talmar**:	think it might be a good idea if we started to push some Techs, as well.


[01-Dec-21 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if other people show support for techs, we could consider further POPI on avalon. i wouldnt want to do it without popular support.


[01-Dec-21 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	well, people are in need of them


[01-Dec-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	people will need to come forward and voice their support for the idea. the typical resolution is "the majority of the vocal players dont use TEC, so the tax budget will not be allocated to TEC". if people speak otherwise, i am happy to plan towards it


[01-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	as far as I know im the only one using techs


[01-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	sweet! what building you putting down for tech if I may ask?


[01-Dec-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	another decision to be made is, do you just want TEC? or do you want TEC ENG+?


[01-Dec-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	PAR is better for overall development, but INF should be sufficient for just TECs, id think


[01-Dec-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I would think we would want eng at some point in the future as well


[01-Dec-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	ENG are very valuable, but not cheap. it would be expensive, and probably require raising taxes. i wouldnt do it unless the majority of vocal participants were in favor


[01-Dec-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	would it make more economical sense to do a inf then a par if we plan on getting the eng anyways?


[01-Dec-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	from the actions of others, i understand it as "if you want the ENG too, its better to just do the PAR"


[01-Dec-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I would say we do that then. but that only if everyone else wants to as well

**RayKowalchuk**:	I wasn't familiar with it so I pulled up the music video. "Lackluster" is a versatile word for both the song, the video, and the lyrics which have no connection with the one word refrain (oh, dear, I seem to be in the same loop as yesterday parsing Van Halen's "Panama"...)

It could be that I was drinking Einsteinium-infused alcohol beyond my pay grade and it created recollections from another dimension...unless someone else had the same hallucination?

**RayKowalchuk**:	@MsOrange - It makes me feel a bit younger to see that Roxy Music was more of an influence to the music I listened to than of substantial familiarity to me. A DJ roomate of mine played Bryan Ferry a fair bit. I'm a bit astonished to see the Wikipedia page claiming Roxy Music Britain's 2nd greatest export after the Beatles (sorry Stones!).

[04-Dec-21 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Assanova**:	at LM just throw C up at mm price ive been dumping 100+ a day into the mm


[04-Dec-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you have to place your order above the MM, otherwise you will never get any


[04-Dec-21 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	theres reasons for C to sell below LM, like shipping constraints


[05-Dec-21 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Dec-21 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Switch it up if it ain't workin', but isn't it generally more likely to reach the eyes you need to post shipping contracts on the narrower focussed message board of the "satellite" planet (Avalon) than the "hub" (Promitor)? I DO generally check both if I've got cargo space, but if looking for a ride to (or from) NYC it would be better to post in the smaller departure/destination of Albany.


[05-Dec-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	In lamenting Avalon songs being stuck in mind, when Promitor was called CR-409e my memory device was the Beach Boys' song "409" (which of course can get the whole Beach Boys discography wedged in the hindbrain..."giddy up, giddy up, 409...I wish they all could be California Girls")


[05-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Crunch time in film school and everyone was burning the midnight oil to get their projects edited we had competitions to get songs stuck in each other's heads. I won the prize for fastest-planted-seed by snapping my fingers and saying in a low voice, "A-jitterbug"

**MsOrange**:	My dick brain can get a song stuck in my head spontaneously now - I don't have to hear it or even read the lyrics - I'm like "honestly why is 'this is halloween' suddenly stuck in my head, it's May?"


[05-Dec-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	currently I am awaiting the chance to celebrate my half million ICA milestone.  just 25k away.  I guess I should put the money to work rather than sitting on it like space Smaug


[05-Dec-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	OMG there was just a Disney+ ad on YouTube and I recognized the background music...but couldn't place it. I went throught my mental Disney catalog and came up empty...until the lyrics filled into my head. "What's This?" From Nightmare Before Christmas! I went WTF, that's not Disney...but of COURSE it now is. :-/ And therefore you'll hear it  or "This is Halloween" anywhere and everywhere.

[08-Dec-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	No more than two major industries per base, as a rule, due to experts


[09-Dec-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But yeah, staying within chem and teching up is a good idea


[09-Dec-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	PP3


[09-Dec-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Just for my 2 cents on LAB, one thing to keep in mind with DDT is that 80% of the cost is the consumables of the 70TECHs. So Lab products are price by Tech consumables more than by input materials. DDT is already at quite a low price, can get it for around 1,5k


[09-Dec-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Perhaps the real money is to be made on those consumables...


[09-Dec-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	if you guys really want SCI on avalon, start spamming LABs (IVP work as well), then ill put the taxes as high as they can go and we will see what can be done :P


[14-Dec-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	there was a line in this week's dev log about an upcoming feature that will make it easier to bootstrap higher-tech populations


[14-Dec-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	"While the big politics rework is pretty much designed, it's been pushed back in our internal timeline for now, so we'll be trying to give you two more long-needed updates before the overhaul: government programs that will, among other things, (and along with an overall friendlier re-balancing) help you get high-tier workforces off the ground more easily; and another often requested option - tier-based taxation, i.e. governors will be able to specify taxes per workforce tier and no longer need to provide a "one-size-fits-all" tax value."


[14-Dec-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i was 99% kidding about pushing high tech; and ill also wait until any feature is implemented before i consider it. though, if they keep their new years promise, thatd be great


[14-Dec-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	well the immediate next line is "I'll finalize the design of both those features before my end-of-the-year vacation, so that they're ready to be part of an update early next year."


[14-Dec-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	soooo


[14-Dec-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	very likely, but i wont say guarenteed


[14-Dec-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	ah, I think I misunderstood what you meant by "new years promise". I thought you were suggesting that it would be done in time for the new year


[14-Dec-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i was the one who misread the original; early next year might end up being... not next year :P


[14-Dec-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	I've got a ship idling on Avalon, if anyone wants to give it something useful to do


[14-Dec-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	LMA VH-331a/22650, and i can offer a prom->avalon shipment when the time comes. youll be getting paid 2/3 of the way :)


[14-Dec-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	not really, its like 65%


[14-Dec-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Sounds like a plan


[14-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dragonican**:	so, out of the 811 open jobs before the POPR, 777 got filled, meaning there are 44 unfilled settler jobs right now. i think thats fine, any one think settlers need additional attention?


[15-Dec-21 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	just bought a load on Prom and I have a bunch coming now.  I blame my stupid lurgy - I enjoy adjusting the flight time nomally but just pressed "go go go!"

**MsOrange**:	thanks Assanova :)


[15-Dec-21 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	each need affects different populations differently, but mostly im just checking in on our settler-employers


[15-Dec-21 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	you may not have a reserve pool to draw from, but if you place your buildings down shortly before POPR, the rest will do its magic and youll get what you need


[15-Dec-21 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Helter5**:	My settler related production time halved with the latest numbers


[15-Dec-21 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	yup, should be fine now


[15-Dec-21 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	just remember in the future, if you want more settlers, youll need to throw it up before POPR


[15-Dec-21 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**thejeffcooper**:	people who understand population mechanics better than I do: if I create jobs for 100 settlers, will they get filled immediately, next wednesday, or none of the above?


[16-Dec-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	you will get some number of settlers next wednesday, and 0 until then, based on last weeks report showing 0 unemployed settlers


[16-Dec-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	:'(


[16-Dec-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I suppose the question is whether it's worth building the buildings now so I don't forget in a week


[16-Dec-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I already have the materials


[16-Dec-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	wait as long as possible so the building doesnt take any durability loss while it has 0 employees. but 1 or 2 days of lost durability is really not a big deal anyways


[16-Dec-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I already have some settlers. iiuc they get distributed across the buildings, right?


[16-Dec-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	so I'd have 8x PP2 at 50% capacity, rather than 4x at 100% and 4x idle


[16-Dec-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	if you have settles assigned to you already that are unemployed (number in parenthesis) they will fill any open jobs immediately


[16-Dec-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	alas, no


[16-Dec-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	but if you have settlers in other buildings, and you want to move them, you would need to demolish the old building after building the new one, im pretty sure that you'd keep them in your pool until the next POPI


[16-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I don't want to move them. Just building more instances of the buildings I already have


[16-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	yeah. just need to build it before the next POPI report then


[16-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	and you will get some


[16-Dec-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	but probably not a full buildings worth if they are in high demand atm


[16-Dec-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	you might tho idk really xD

[01-Jan-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, I got busy with a bunch of other things. I see someone grabbed it already


[01-Jan-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	yeah sorry that was me - I was worried that kyzekk needed them in a hurry


[01-Jan-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I guess being governor is a bit more time consuming than people think it will be


[01-Jan-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I'm currently playing subnautica but I get pretty motion sick so have to take breaks to recover - this is probably helpful to my playing of PrUn :D

[01-Jan-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I need some Rat and Dw if anyone has any for sale


[03-Jan-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I usually have food and fuel, but one of my corpmates just wiped me out. It'll be a couple days before I can supply everyone again


[03-Jan-22 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Talmar's convenience is CLOSED for the holidays :D


[03-Jan-22 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	just bad timing. Corpmate was on vacation over the holiday, so ran out of basically everything, so he came in and wiped me out. Plus I also just sent a bunch of food off to Montem. So that double whammy brought my supplies down to nothing


[03-Jan-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oooof

[03-Jan-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Today's musings - given it's only use is in Kevlar production and the price it sells would make Kevlar way more expensive than it sells for how come the makers of TCL are selling it for 1200 when it costs about 350 to make?  Who could possibly be buying it?


[03-Jan-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	this is caused by me updating my spreadsheet to reflect the things I could make at a PP3 and going 'nope not making that even though I could make the kevlar myself'


[03-Jan-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I think you are overlooking the consumables costs there, which is significant


[03-Jan-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	TCL should be closer to 1400, tbh


[03-Jan-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I shouldn't be - I calculate an hourly running rate for each of my buildings based on their consumables


[03-Jan-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	but if that is the case how come KV sells for 5-6k given it has 5 of them in?


[03-Jan-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	(ooo I probably am aren't I because I don't actually own a LAB - my bad :D)


[03-Jan-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	yeah, LABs are expensive to run


[03-Jan-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	no idea why KV is so 'cheap' then


[03-Jan-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	if you see someone selling KV for 5 or 6K, I would grab it! LOL! that's stupid cheap!


[03-Jan-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Actually, I just grabbed all of that! :D


[03-Jan-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	those should sell for about 10K. no idea why people are selling them at a loss

**thejeffcooper**:	what about upgrading it?


[10-Jan-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	or are we bottlenecked on supplies regardless?


[10-Jan-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	Upgrading would let us run on cheaper materials; that's why we built the second level SST in the first place, so we could run on cheap DW


[10-Jan-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lordcirth**:	But the 3rd level costs a more, so going DW+OFF may be better

**Talmar**:	I just shipped all my BFabs up to Prom, so just missed ya


[13-Jan-22 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	And it don't mean you are an idiot for making DW without PG. It's actually faster to make it that way, so if you have lots of excess water, it's not a bad idea at all. If you are really tight on water, then it's a bad idea!


[14-Jan-22 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I'm just turning up my food industries (I got tired of paying for RAT and DW, so I plopped a base on prom)

[14-Jan-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-22 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**IshNarGarn**:	ty & hi, finally i arrived here


[17-Jan-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IshNarGarn**:	any idea, if i can make a screen template which i can use for new base? switching back and forth is no fun


[17-Jan-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	you can make multiple screens, but you can't duplicate or make a proper template sadly


[17-Jan-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IshNarGarn**:	13 tiles for each base, properly aligned is quite some work


[17-Jan-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	it is, on the other hand, one start playing around with it again =D and its not every day you make a new base ^^


[17-Jan-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	but I agree, template would be nice


[17-Jan-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IshNarGarn**:	that's true, i'm playing quite casual, so it takes some longer until new base

**Talmar**:	I don't have a separate screen for base. I have all of my Base Overviews, and base inventories, and my ships, on one screen. I have all of my extra warehouses on another screen, I have the LM's on a third screen, and I have the main chats I use on a 4th screen


[18-Jan-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Having all of my base overviews and inventories on one screen really helps when I'm trying to figure out logistics


[18-Jan-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IshNarGarn**:	i have dedicated LM- and chat-screens, too, but all base overviews and inventories is a good point to try again. had such setup in last universe but on small screen, was not that much helpful back then


[18-Jan-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	screen size matters


[18-Jan-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IshNarGarn**:	i know, and i'm happy now 4K on large screen is great for PrUn


[18-Jan-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	why was our CoGC not funded? this kind of thing shouldn't be happening with an active Gov

[19-Jan-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I already have a job :D


[19-Jan-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I think ultimately that's what breaks the game for me (and I won't be renewing when my sub runs out in a month) is that it can feel a bit like a second job


[19-Jan-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	Anyhoo - what do you need from us to ease your pain KyZekk?


[19-Jan-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	give me 4 hours and it will be fixed. have a ship on the way from HRT


[19-Jan-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	and yeah im in the same boat MSorange. except with school.

[19-Jan-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	gotcha - right I'm going to log off and see if I can finish subnautica before my heart gives out


[19-Jan-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	also if either Kaygran or Talmar want to run for governor feel free I only did it so there was someone with more experience in the game and not gonna run of with the money.


[19-Jan-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	For those prices? Very happy to oblige!


[06-Feb-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	would you be willing to sell water, or anymore drinking water?


[06-Feb-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	be happy to pay over cx price


[06-Feb-22 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	You drained me of DW, unfortunately, and I turn extra H2O into DW as soon as I have it


[06-Feb-22 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I paid over cx price so it'll be worthwhile to buy DW right then and there and ship it back to your stock


[06-Feb-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	be happy to pay over cx if you got anymore stock later on


[06-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	You're in luck! (And so am I, cos I'm gonna need more *very* soon now as well, lol.) I've got a ship en route to HRT as we speak, ETA 5 hrs. I can get some back here lickity split. How much DW would you like? And how long can you wait if I buy H2O and produce it myself?


[06-Feb-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	at the moment there's no reasonably priced water on the exchange, I bought everything yesterday to fill a contract that I accidentally undersold


[06-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Oh, that's right, I forgot I did see that. DW it is then. How much you looking for?


[06-Feb-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	if you wanna ship me ~600 from the exchange @58/u I'll but it from you @61, pay for your fuel to get here


[06-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Yeah, that should more than cover it


[06-Feb-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Wow, that's only what... 6 tons, too? Is that math right? That's a lot of empty space, lol


[06-Feb-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	yeah drinking water either breaks the laws of physics of that 1 unit of DW is far less by vol/weight than raw water


[06-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	would you like the ad up now, delivery by 3 days?


[06-Feb-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	I'll need that actually, yeah. I'm not liquid enough right now to cover it.


[06-Feb-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	ad up


[06-Feb-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	And buy order placed


[06-Feb-22 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Might wait a bit to see if I can get a better bid than 58 first, but it should be en route to Avalon in < 24 hrs


[06-Feb-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	given that there's very small amounts of water, that may be unlikely


[06-Feb-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	I'll keep mine at top bid, so unless they remove and up their sell price out of spite, I won't lose anything by waiting


[06-Feb-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	kk thanks for the help it is much appreciated as I sort out the mess I put myself into


[06-Feb-22 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Haha, no prob. Nice thing about a free market game is I'm helping myself at the same time as I help you.


[06-Feb-22 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	You set up on Boucher, right? I seem to remember seeing that in the chat. Shipping bottleneck?


[06-Feb-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	indeed. I can only dedicate one ship to the route and it's very limited in capacity.


[06-Feb-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	lately there's been a massive shipping bottleneck I can't get anything out of there even at 25 per t/m^3


[06-Feb-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	Oof


[06-Feb-22 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	I found Boucher via the FIO tools a few days ago, and was heavily considering it, but luckily I was warned about the bottleneck issues


[06-Feb-22 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	yes having that base essentially required having 3 ships. I got 25 farms on promitor so I had to move water production elsewhere


[06-Feb-22 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i think its good if you still have excess shipping capacity , but as you expand it will be a bit hard


[06-Feb-22 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	So thank you for being the very instructive example for the rest of us for what not to do  XD


[06-Feb-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	^^^ that worked well till this week when water supplies dried up entirely


[06-Feb-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ephemarel**:	@Assanova right, it seems like a no-brainer for the long-term... unfortunately, with FTL ships only just being produced, that's a very long term indeed


[06-Feb-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	a pure DW base on boucher though is s till good, you would only need to visit it once every week

**MsOrange**:	Oh god I've just fallen foul of having no paid account.  I wanted to buy 1 of something just to tide me over - it was clearly over priced but 1 would have been enough to add to the 2 I have and produce a thing.


[24-Feb-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	but no it was outside of the price band so I couldn't

[25-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I should start making it on Prom (I mine water already) but if I diversify any more I'll be Amazon


[25-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	ads are up on the LM, if you need some rats/dw.


[25-Feb-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and you should have seen my Montem base... had 10 different production lines running... what a mess! I've recently cleaned it up some, and am down to 8, I think!


[25-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Also, I have more shipping ads Prom to Avalon. Ads are on Prom


[25-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	I tend to go Avalon <-> HRT with one ship and HRT <-> Prom with the other, less often - that's the one I send out for supplies occasionally


[25-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I have my glass ship running all over the system, burning hard, just to keep all my bases supplied


[25-Feb-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	yeah, I'm thinking I'll be in the market for an STL ship before too long


[25-Feb-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	branching into a new industry with the next base, and it's going to be in approximately the middle of nowhere


[25-Feb-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MsOrange**:	how much does a glass ship cost all in?  I notice we have a shipyard in the system


[25-Feb-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I thought I saw someone say ~500k once, but I have no idea how accurate that is


[25-Feb-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I haven't looked seriously into it


[25-Feb-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	well, most of the focus is now into FTL ships, which are in the 4-5M range. But a glass ship, with 500 cargo space is around 500K. You can now get STL ships with large cargo as well


[25-Feb-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	Rek produces STL ships at 550k. Can be paid in ICA NCC or combo with goods


[25-Feb-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	is Rek a person or a corp?


[25-Feb-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Rek is in my corp


[25-Feb-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	he's one of the main ship building coordinators


[25-Feb-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Building a ship is an entire corp project. You need many people making things to make it happen

[26-Feb-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Mar-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	depends on who picks up your contract. Some people are dicks, and will wait until the last minute to finish it. Some will have it done in hours. So, it's hit or miss.


[08-Mar-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	What @Talmar said is true got local market contracts. For contracts on the commodity exchange (cx), they fill immediately but you have to have an inventory to collect them into


[08-Mar-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	That's usually a ship at the station or a warehouse there

**armorlord**:	Hello everyone. as newly elected governor I have set population taxes to be more reflective of the operating costs related to POPI that will be required to support them. First priority will be to ensure steady unemployment levels of pioneers and settlers. Second will be to ensure technician levels do not fall further. third priority is to work toward supplying engineer requirements to meet the current open jobs. Initially this will only be possible via government program

I'd be happy to make and update a bids table if there is enough demand and keep the credits circulating in a tighter loop. The alternative is directly buying POPI goods on the exchange, which I have been doing this week to get POPI running asap. A side note, have been keeping balance sheet for taxes; will send details after the population report tomorrow.

**deNoailles**:	Hi all! I'm new here. What's the going rate for small/medium shipments to/from Avalon and Prom/HRT? Is there anyone who makes regular trips I should be aware of? Thanks!


[12-Apr-22 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	hello and welcome. avalon is a much quieter place than promitor. many ships come full and leave mostly empty so there's typically one way shipping


[12-Apr-22 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	i've seen rates in the 5-10/unit


[12-Apr-22 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	I make a trip avalon to hrt every 1,5 days, normally have 200t/v spare


[12-Apr-22 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Good to know. Thank you both!


[12-Apr-22 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	hrt to prom is spare. prom to avalon is normally full


[12-Apr-22 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	FWIW, I usually pay at least 4 per major measurement, with a minimum of 100 for smaller shipments. Tack on fuel rates if you want to play with the BLU command

**Bant**:	o/ Welcome new people. Avalon is a weird planet to start on, but not a bad one! Most of the tutorial careers probably don't work very well here? I recommend just building Food Processors and buying inputs at the Hortus CX. Promitor is overflowing with Farmers now and agricultural goods are abundant, but can't be grown here on Avalon. We do have a 25% bonus to Food Processing, however, which works out quite well.

[21-Apr-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I'm not sure if this planet is the best for fuel production. TS is present in a rather small quantity here, and HE3 can be directly extracted from other planets, saving on refinery duty cycle

**armorlord**:	COGC commerece maintainance just doubled along with festivities III. Coffers will be bankrupt if taxes would not be increased slightly. I'm hopeful that 10-30 credits more per day won't affect our new players too wildly

**armorlord**:	happy to see the population report showing unemployment at the three important tiers, and 1 open engineering job. The next week or two will be spent on maintainance supplies for the POPI and keeping festivities at level II as it seems to balance the current population requirements. Excess funds will be added to the coffers for future expansion pending player and price levels

**Talmar**:	for some new players (who have Pro/Basic), there is someone selling H on Hortus-I for 40/u. That's 10/u UNDER the MM (50/u) You can make a little cash buying it there, and selling to the CX. Or, you can jump it to Moria CX and sell it for 62+/u


[09-May-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Just remember that Moria uses NCC as cash, not ICA, so buy stuff there, to bring back and sell here, to convert the currency back

**armorlord**:	i'll be running for another term as governor. I've been very pleased with the progress made to keep full employment and now that POPI resources have been stockpiled I'll begin accumulating taxes to restore the coffers which are nearly empty.

**armorlord**:	Due to the growing population and generally increased cx prices, taxes  might need to be raised by 2-3 credits for pioneers, 3-4 credits for settlers next week. otherwise the functioning of the planet is quite secure

**Netheril**:	Hi there


[14-May-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	if you look at the population infrastructure there is the PAR that needs those items on a regular basis to  maintain worker numbers, crucially at this time technicians and to a lesser extend engineers


[14-May-22 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I've been buying items at the exchange using the taxes and contributing the items to the POPI


[14-May-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	if you wish to sell anything to contribute to any of the POPI let me know and I'll set up a recurring purchase becuase at this time there are no scheduled sellers

**armorlord**:	forgot to mention yesterday: I am very pleased with the progress of the population numbers, especially the technicians reaching 33% unemployment. Not many planets can offer that tier of a workforce on an immediate basis and out little planet is only half full. Coffers will continue to run on fumes for this week despite the ~3 credits increase in taxes due to the expanding population to the point that next week will likely go into negatives territory if taxes were not increased. I will continue attempting to tweak fees in the smallest possible increments to match expenses, likely a 2 credits increase for pioneers sometime next week

**armorlord**:	your continued votes are highly appreciated. If elected, my plan will remain largely the same with keeping decent unemployment levels and growing the coffers for future POPI works. all infrastructure is supplied with over 2 months in stock.   A reversal of the last tax hike will likely take place after the weekly tax revenue summary on Sunday

**DiggingLake**:	Hi everyone!  I'm currently standing for Governor of Avalon, as you can see. My main policy platform is the following: to lower taxes as much as possible, maintain and expand infrastructure as needed to ensure that Pioneers and Settlers remain plentiful, and to maintain open communication on how our fine planet is doing.  Above all, though, I'm mostly standing because I think a little bit of friendly competition is beneficial for both sides, and so no matter the outcome this election cycle should hopefully be a fun one.


[07-Jul-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I've been keeping quiet with updates as the planet is back to running optimally for two weeks. I'm still interested in continuing the governorship. In the past 3 months the planet has transformed from a lackluster ball with unfilled POPI to having acceptable population of every needed tier. Given the new ENG openings a targeted program will be run when the current festivities expires. Taxes have been on the lower end of managed planets (it is not uncommon to see pioneer taxes in the 35-40s range) yet the coffers have been sufficient to cater to all POPI and the COGC while still modestly grow on a weekly basis with a current reserve of around 500k, growing roughly by 20-30k per week. ( see link for complete P&L: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nje_qEWrt_DcUNNrQIlAP1VWIGjayRXA1y0HZsguomM/edit?usp=sharing ). If continued to be elected I will continue to maintain topped-off POPI by donating my shipping capacity and purchasing as much as available from the local producers.

**DiggingLake**:	Avalon has some of the highest taxes in Hortus: none of the major planets have higher taxes on Pioneers (let alone in the 35-40 range), and most are far lower. Out of Avalon, Boucher, Promitor and Nova Honshu, the only tax brackets in which Avalon is not highest is Scientists and Settlers (Nova Honshu has slightly higher settler taxes at 40, which offset the PIO taxes of 10). While it may be the case that taxes are higher somewhere else, down in Hortus Avalon is not on the lower end: its on the higher end.


[08-Jul-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	in this list of planets the taxes are lwoer as POPI is not filled up - certainly not boucher which misses most of its POPI consumables, and certainly not nova honshu which doesnt have much POPI to begin with - that is the mismanaged state avalon was in 3 months ago


[08-Jul-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	promitor can indeed maintain lower taxes for pioneers as it is such a gigantic planet the overall revenue is sufficient to keep them all happy. a counterexample is vallis and montem which still maintain pioneer taxes at 40 as a forgotten attempt to increase coffers


[08-Jul-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	perhaps I should rephrase - avalon taxes are maintained at its current levels while also having POPI and COGC well managed - not once in 3 months has the planet experienced anything but prosperity as I donated all shipping capacity and a million credits to make that happen

[08-Jul-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	And, as far as not caring what the tax rate is: sure, in that case you should probably stick with what you know.


[08-Jul-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Do I personally have issues paying the taxes? No, not really.


[08-Jul-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	But the taxes are relatively high, when through better management of POPI and judicious use of donations they could be lowered, and given the player wave from Promitor is going to be hitting here soon (if it hasn't arrived already) I believe it is well worth lowering taxes on Avalon now the planet isn't strapped for cash.


[08-Jul-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	@RayKowalchuk - Yeah, definitely notice real life taxes a lot more. :D


[08-Jul-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I agree with IRL taxes. The player wave from promitor has not hit the planet at all at this time


[08-Jul-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	A reserve of 500k is the bare minimum to be able to maintain POPI and pay for programs. As of the last few weeks having 20-30k coffers growth means taxes are perfectly set at this time and should not be lowered


[08-Jul-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	If a wave from promitor will hit the planet it is likely that the additional demand for population will not outstrip current expenditures


[08-Jul-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-22 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I have excellent planetary news. with the recent weekly tax income and well-stocked POPI the coffers are approaching pre-management levels of approximately 3 months ago. pioneer taxes can be lowered by an additional credit for the week, plus likely another credit next week


[10-Jul-22 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	with this reduction and no large shifts in the population the planet will likely achieve POPI steady-state


[10-Jul-22 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	once this is achieved and maintained for a few weeks I'll reach out again and see if the denizens would be interested in keeping largely minimal taxes or attempt to continue slowly enlarging the rainy-day coffers

**DiggingLake**:	Looks like I was right, taxes can easily be lowered, or otherwise me standing as candidate has rattled the Governor more than I thought (such that they feel the need to cut taxes during the election campaign).


[11-Jul-22 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if he wasn't constantly altering the tax rate I'd be inclined to believe you, it's better than other governors that set and forget about the tax rate


[11-Jul-22 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that's not to say I don't apricate the debate mind you, it was interesting to read


[11-Jul-22 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but in this case, I'm inclinded to believe Armorlord


[11-Jul-22 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Either way, taxes could still be cut further: as taxpayers, we are paying through the nose to fight game mechanics and maintain massive population buffers (31% unemployment on Settlers, for example, which is why they are so unhappy and keep trying to leave). While there may be edge cases where such massive population buffers are used, the likelihood is that most of the money is just going to be wasted as the game mechanics slowly bleed population.


[11-Jul-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	This is not necessarily negligent use of planetary resources, just inefficient. It’s throwing our money at the problem, rather than using our money smartly.

**armorlord**:	you are welcome to see the changes in taxes in the P&L of the planet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nje_qEWrt_DcUNNrQIlAP1VWIGjayRXA1y0HZsguomM/edit#gid=0 however this is greatly skewed by the player influx

[11-Jul-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	regardless, this is not inefficient use of taxes. none has been misused including the quantity sitting at the coffers. reducing pioneer unemployment will greatly inhibit the growth of the higher population tiers


[11-Jul-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	speaking of which, since we have a sufficient population buffer this week's program will be engineer immigration to fill the listed open jobs. There might be some leftover engineers - if anyone considered developing another structure


[11-Jul-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	money is not thrown anywhere


[11-Jul-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	It doesn't have to be misused to be inefficient: if your objective is higher tier growth, then you are far better off minimising unemployment at lower tiers so that you get the maximum effect for the POPI on the happiness of higher tiers.


[11-Jul-22 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Don't get me wrong: throwing money at it works. Just look at Circe, which is probably the most developed planet of them all. But there are other ways to do it, and its worth highlighting that even if people ultimately prefer to maintain high taxes and high spending.


[11-Jul-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(Since what is an election but a debate on how the local government should function?)


[11-Jul-22 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Well, I guess it could be a corp vs corp election, but from my understanding neither of us are running as candidates from major corps.

[11-Jul-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	And yes, I have never been part of a corp


[11-Jul-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Circe is the most developed planet because SNF needed a high-tech planet to do high-tech stuff, so we threw millions at it. Massive building initiative to boost those high tech pops. And this was before the program changes.

**Nirces**:	ad up for OVE


[12-Jul-22 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Higher tiers from from Education and Migration, with Engineers and above coming from Education only


[12-Jul-22 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Education is a percentage of the previous tier, higher umeployment can lead to more being promoted to a higher tier, providing you can keep everyone 50% happy, massive employment can lead to larger growth


[12-Jul-22 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	of Engineers and above, Technicians will simply migrate in if they are happy


[12-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	My understanding was that the education rate was affected by the happiness of the tier being educated into, and that maintaining happiness at said tier was also important to prevent them migrating away after you had put the effort in to spawn them in the first place.


[12-Jul-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	And, also, that maintaining happiness is much harder with high levels of unemployment in lower tiers, due to how needs are shared across and consumed by multiple tiers.

[10-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not really, though there might be someone's side prohect, the HRT region is poor on metals and LST to make them


[10-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	best bet is by in either MOR or ANT regions, they usually buy the stuff we produce better at a higher price anyway


[10-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	buy* in either MOR or ANT...


[10-Aug-22 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the HRT region is the bread basket of the game, BEN is ok, though I think that is more out of desperation since they are opposite us, but have fallen behind recently

**bazdakka**:	Promitor is insanely specialized, but the planets in system also allow really good fuel production, but it's not something I've done myself, so I can't say for sure


[10-Aug-22 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but most people here have a base on Promtor as well, grow crops there, ship them here and have all their FP here instead


[10-Aug-22 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but FP take up a lot less space than the FRMs do, so there is usually space left over on this planet, and people do various things with it, some use it to produce their own fuel


[10-Aug-22 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	of course, not everyone specializes to this degree, but it is a fairly common one


[10-Aug-22 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's one of the balancing things in this game, how much do you want to specialize, vs being a jack of all trades, and the answer is different for each person

**freiksenet**:	I see, thanks


[10-Aug-22 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-22 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-22 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the game is simple, but there are more layers than you'd think at first, but each one follows on from the basic lessons, so it's not to hard to follow most of the time

**freiksenet**:	dunno what else, I guess I can import more gases and do fuel

**bazdakka**:	HE3? no HE3 on this planet


[10-Aug-22 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, I see, TS into HE3, yeah, there is a few duel producers here, there are some good H planets in system but since they are gas giants, it's better to put the refineries here instead


[10-Aug-22 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	TS refining is generally pretty bad: you are far better using those refinery cycles on fuel instead and just buying in the HE3.


[10-Aug-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nalini**:	If you do HE3, I will buy everything back from you. Right now I need about 130 a day, but if I get a good supplier I can expand and consume more.


[10-Aug-22 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**freiksenet**:	Sounds good, I'll start producing it tomorrow. I only have one refinery rn.


[10-Aug-22 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Aug-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	This planet is for Food Production. If you want to refine fuel, you create a base on Helion Prime, which has a CoCG for Fuel Production. ;)


[10-Aug-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	VH-043e is the HE3 planet. If you need lots of that, talk to the people there and you can get lots.


[10-Aug-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	It's 1 jump from here


[10-Aug-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	If you are a new player, you are probably better off not going to Helion Prime yet: INS is pretty expensive. Same with the option of making FF on Hydron, which is really a mid/late game play rather than something you want to do as a new player.


[10-Aug-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	But yes, refining HE3 here is almost certainly not worth it: you'd be far better off buying it from the GG direct or from the CX.

**DiggingLake**:	Dropped the Pioneer taxes to 10 (from 22-24) and the Settler taxes to 20 (from 34-36). I've left the others alone for now, while I figure out to what degree the government needs to support those population tiers (and because I think new players, who are likely to see the highest relative benefit to profitability from lower taxes, are less likely to be in those tiers).

[24-Aug-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Otherwise POPR looks decent. I might drop the program next week to Festivities I, unless anyone plans to employ those extra engineers (since the pioneers will continue to grow regardless and the other tiers have healthy unemployment numbers).


[24-Aug-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	If its spread out over a few weeks it should be fine, its when multiple megabases are dropped in the same week that it becomes a bit of a problem.


[24-Aug-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(Even then, though, pioneers are fairly responsive compared to the other tiers and it isn't too hard to get them to flood in afterwards to fix any temporary shortfall.)

**DiggingLake**:	Looks most of the gain from the previous POPR went into unemployment, so stagnation in Pioneers isn't too bad an effect (since it means we aren't spending money trying to fight the game mechanics). It does look like there is a decent number educating: while not ideal, given their unemployment numbers, it is a little harder to pump them than Pioneers and as such I'm inclined to think it is ok. The trickle should settle into an equilibrium at some point (like it has with Engineers). Given all that, unless something changes I'm going to keep it on Planetary Festivities 1 next week too.

**DiggingLake**:	That wasn't a great POPR, although it wasn't a complete disaster: shouldn't have impacted anyone apart from the engineers (who seem to have dipped to 173, just below the max employment rate) due to the unemployment buffers, fortunately, but it is pretty clear we still need the weekly programs active and don't have the infrastructure to support the pops otherwise. I've queued some Festivities IIs to counteract last week and we'll see how that impacts things next week.


[07-Sep-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	I'm also considering putting another SST down, if it is cost effective to do so, but PIO happiness isn't really an issue and it doesn't look like the higher tier pops are safety capped right now.

[17-Oct-22 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Sorry about that: I was trying to figure out what happened, and I think I found the reason why other governors don't fill immediately after COGC upkeep triggers.


[17-Oct-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Namely, because COGC upkeep is determined by the number of bases and there isn't a buffer, you end up with a situation where the COGC upkeep goes up slightly and you are no longer meeting all the requirements.


[17-Oct-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	There must be some grace period before the increased upkeep applies, since otherwise someone joining a minute before the upkeep trigger would cause a strike, but I guess it doesn't cover 10 days.


[17-Oct-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	Hey there, Avalonians.


[24-Oct-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Just letting you know that I've gone ahead and dropped taxes on Settlers by 5 across the board.


[24-Oct-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	As part of the tax changes, I've also regularised the tax brackets (mostly because it was bugging me): anyone running Fuel Refining Technicians are now paying the standard 210 instead of 190, and anyone running Food Industry Scientists are now paying 1500 instead of 1250.


[24-Oct-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Will that affect anyone? No, neither of those two categories exist, but for transparencies sake I thought it best to highlight it anyway.


[24-Oct-22 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	In other news, we are back on Festivities II, so hopefully POPR is a little better this week, but I'll have an update for that after POPR updates (apologies for the lack of update last week).

[02-Feb-23 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**marismols**:	done


[02-Feb-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	tanks, you saved a day, literaly :)


[02-Feb-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	hint, when asking something like that, put the ad up first, that way anyone that wants to fill it can do so instantly, if it's something you urgently, pay near the ask price of the local  the local CX


[02-Feb-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	ok


[02-Feb-23 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	all good, I've forgotten things before, if it's not urgent, like my ad for bulk buying RAT earlier, price is fine, but when I need something earlier, I pay a premium to get things done quickly


[02-Feb-23 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	eg, when setting up a base recently, I forgot to bring PSL, I paid someone the price of a full cargo hold for only 10 units of space to bring them out quickly, knowing there were return contracts for him


[02-Feb-23 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I see


[02-Feb-23 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	look at it this way, you aren't so much paying for the good, as much as the speedy service


[02-Feb-23 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I agree


[02-Feb-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	bit like paying ask price for goods on the CX, your paying more for fast service, compared to just putting a buy ad up, in this case,, it's a bit like that and asking for delivery as well


[02-Feb-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's how I justify my expensive fast buys anyway


[02-Feb-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I'll put another ad, seems the number was wrong, needed 8


[02-Feb-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	sorry, small letters on the screen


[02-Feb-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	sure, I keep plenty on the planet for repairs (I don't need nearly as many as I have stored, I just don't want to have to remember to ship more of them)


[02-Feb-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	ok put it up


[02-Feb-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	there are a few that I open frequently, though aren't important enough to be worth a tile (various CXM tickers) that I always have to resize


[02-Feb-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So….one thing you can try if you have a multi-monitor. Run the Steam version on a monitor with a lesser resolution and the browser version with your extensions on the main. Then use Steam to access the more difficult to read bits on the secondary with the lower res.


[02-Feb-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Unless the browser version will allow you to drag buffers to other monitors…not sure as I haven’t tried, lol. Then you’d just need the 2 monitors.

**Talmar**:	whoever is trying to sell water for 40/u, you can F right off. That's 2 times what it's worth


[07-Feb-23 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I noticed you'd recently returned, were you around during the  open price manipulation of water a couple of weeks ago, if not, short of it is someone went to all 4 CXs and brought out al the water, then listed buy ads at 40 of that currency and refreshed every day so we couldn't just fill it, relisted it for 100 of said currencies, and he ended up buying of half a million units of it, they held the price that high for close to a month


[07-Feb-23 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	annoying that they did it, impressive they succeeded for as long as they did


[07-Feb-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, it's all still listed, mostly since I doubt he can actually move that much water, and he's just storing it at the CX to save on warehouse fees

**Zuul**:	Don’t know that it was needed. Mostly just sticker shock from a recently returned player at water. Honestly, until drastic threw up 40k water just the other day it was still hitting 38-40 on the CX just a few days ago. It wasn’t that long ago my 38 ICA offer got bought up on the CX.


[07-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	high water prices drives up the prices on everything farming related, so the price of rats and dw go way up, which causes the prices of everything to go up. It's all linked


[07-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and no, I missed the water hijacking, but heard about it just the other day. Stupid


[07-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You would think that....but most of the folks engaged in mass RAT production anymore also self produce their water. So the massive price hike didn't really affect RAT prices at all. Most of us just kept on crunching RAT's and ignored the madness of the water market.


[07-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Boucher provides =)


[07-Feb-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, there was a dedicated push back against it, people were listing fair prices on LMs to get around this guys outrageous buy orders on the CX, kept things running

**DiggingLake**:	POPR is looking fairly decent. Looks like we've had a massive jump in technician usage, but most of the open jobs seem to be covered and the rest should easily be covered next week. Pioneers are starting to peak at their unemployment level, and so should stabilise.

[15-Feb-23 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	I'd say someone base dropped on the planet


[15-Feb-23 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is over 800 new tech jobs in a single week


[15-Feb-23 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if I had to guess, I'd say someone put down a lot of IVPs


[15-Feb-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though I wouldn't have thought the demand for those products would be that high


[15-Feb-23 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That’s a reasonable conclusion though


[15-Feb-23 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	But that would be something like 11 IVPs worth


[15-Feb-23 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, it's just, that is a lot of IVPs


[15-Feb-23 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	Not seeing much to comment on with POPR. The technicians shortage is gone, and while we might see a short Engineer shortage due to the prior weeks of high unemployment (seemingly triggered by Engineer buildings being demolished) we should see that fix itself in a couple of weeks.

[22-Feb-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Atomiccow**:	Idk how my financial stability is so awful either, I have a relatively strong 2-planet base setup going, but meh, i do like to spend my profits on expanding my base


[22-Feb-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It seems to only care about the last couple periods for stability. And….well….how stable they are. I have never had a period I’m the red, but I did have a stability of C for a week or so when my listed profits went from a million one period, to 50k the next period.


[22-Feb-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In the red…stupid fat fingers and autocorrect, lol


[22-Feb-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Ratings are pretttttyy pointless. Wouldnt worry much about it


[22-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	for most standard uses, yes, that is true, however, dropping the total off of A is so rare that when it happens, pay attention to why, stability is the hardest to raise, and activity is hard to drop if you log it most days, reliability only drops if you fail a contract, which is a big red flag to potential partners on the LM


[22-Feb-23 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	also, new players that have brought pro but haven't earned a rating yet deserve note, since the amount of lost shipments caused by them previously is note worthy enough that I never put a shipping contract at a P rating, I usually give it a C so anyone that brought pro at least a week ago can accept, but it's only to prevent people that get pro within their first week and drop the game after that accepting shipping ads, as to buy or sell ads, those can stay P rated, though if they don't fill their end when they accept, I check the company age before I do my end


[23-Feb-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Sure...but go look at an LM and tell me how many require A ratings in comparison to P

***TechnoProblem** joined.*


[23-Feb-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	true, most of those are to make them easy to see when someone puts an ad up for a particular person (this is a habit from before CONTD existed). most people use P because it doesn't matter (plus it's the default), shipping contracts are much more likely to be rated


[23-Feb-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm just pointing out reasons why the rating exists, and what it's used for


[23-Feb-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, I use P for general merchandise shipping (anything that I'm not "really" going to give a shit about vanishing in a puff of COLIQ smoke), A for things that are important, and CONTD's for critical freight movements


[24-Feb-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	I've gone ahead and filled the PAR a bit more, to soften the impact of Engineer unhappiness. Hopefully it doesn't yo-yo too much, but on reflection it seemed like it was a relatively cheap measure to head off any further potential drops.


[24-Feb-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	I've also gone ahead and dropped the taxes on Settlers to 10, same as Pioneers, since I didn't see a good reason to keep it at a higher level given the consistently large surplus of Settlers Avalon seems to accrue.

Engineers should be sorted now, and while the Pioneer buffer is getting a little low it does look like the trend is heading in the right direction so we should hopefully see some growth either this week or next.

[10-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I just finally became a net producer of coffee last night because of the coffee madness. Not a lot, I’m at positive 17 units a day.


[10-Mar-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomiccow**:	Better then negative 17! How many hydros you have setup?


[10-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	9 on Prom


[10-Mar-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They mostly just run ALG/VEG, the CAF is kind of a side thing. Dropped a few FP's there as well to do the brewing. Avalon is already capped out on how much the FP's can process.


[10-Mar-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomiccow**:	Nice i have 10 farms and 3 rigs going on prom right now. Been considering dropping a couple hydros but wasn't sure yet


[10-Mar-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've got 9 HYF's, 15 FRM's, and a big fat 0 for RIG's. I pump all that up at Boucher. HYF's need so much H2O trying to pump it on Prom would just eat a huge amount of the available area.


[10-Mar-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomiccow**:	Ya the water requirement is what threw me off, haven't balanced it yet without doing something like boucher


[10-Mar-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Atomiccow**:	so got my farms on prom and fps going on avalon for rations, need to save up and get ready for #3 probably


[10-Mar-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The exact route I followed, if it matters to you, was add Avalon. Move all FP's off Prom to ava and add more FRM's. Then add just a couple HYF's to Prom and set them for ALG to take the protein requirement for RAT's off the FRMs. Water for just a couple isn't insurmountable pumping locally. Then went and opened Boucher and added all the additional HYF's

**DiggingLake**:	As far as POPR, looks like we had a slight shortage of PIOs due to new bases but all of those should be filled now. I'd already started Festivities III after being informed of a base going down, so hopefully we should see buffers build up a bit in the next POPR, but I don't think I'll need to run it twice.


[15-Mar-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye that really depends on the planets POPR :)


[17-Mar-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	on which there already is 328 open jobs since last report :D


[17-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	Oops didn't think of checking that


[17-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	Well i'm only short on 36 pioneers so its not so bad


[17-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Open jobs were prior to the last report: with the 2771 change, all empty jobs were filled.


[17-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye it should be fixed within next report, which is in 5 days


[17-Mar-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	almost everyone make's mistake on that first time looking at POPR though I recon ^_^'


[17-Mar-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	kinda intuitive think so, as unemployment/open jobs are at the bottom of the report


[17-Mar-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Yeah, its a very common mistake.


[17-Mar-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	Yeah and i think it would also make more sense to know how many jobs are not filled yet


[17-Mar-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Apr-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	is there anybody with some TS and HE3 on hand ?


[06-Apr-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	I`m starting up some REF`s for personal use, but could use some of the inputs to kickstart the process :)


[06-Apr-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I recommend not using TS, you can mine HE3 directly and it's much cheaper to do, TS was used early universe used when HE3 was inaccessible due to no one being able to make it yet


[06-Apr-23 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is because all HE3 deposits are on gas giants that require AEF to settle, and gas giants usually have some other problem with settling them as well


[06-Apr-23 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	VH-043e if you want one close by


[06-Apr-23 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	For HE3


[06-Apr-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	The thing is though that I use REF for personal use only, so mining it locally seemed like a good idea


[06-Apr-23 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, just pointing out that TS is the least effective way to use it, your almost better buying the HE3 in than mining TS and turning it into HE3


[06-Apr-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	DiggingLake (Avalon gov) had some buys for FOD on LM. They could have just expired so he may def still want


[06-Apr-23 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	@Talmar is the FOD HERE or on HP?


[06-Apr-23 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	The stupid thing is that TS wasn't available early universe: by the time TS was added here, the first HE3 gas giant (Hermes) had already been tapped.


[06-Apr-23 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Its an early game bootstrap material that wasn't available early game.


[06-Apr-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mr.Asbestos**:	oh hey, I actually have a related question: so INS is stupidly expensive to make but more importantly requires Ar... which is only ever present on planets where you already need INS to settle (except OS-099c but it has laughable concentrations of it, and is super far away) - so how was that bootstrapped?


[06-Apr-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	there were probably planets that had very small deposits of AR which did not need INS


[06-Apr-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mr.Asbestos**:	not according to yapt


[06-Apr-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mr.Asbestos**:	or do you mean  "were", not "are"?


[06-Apr-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	There ARE planets with AR that dont require INS


[06-Apr-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	VH-192c is very close to here for example


[06-Apr-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mr.Asbestos**:	hm, alright, I guess my brain is already trained to skip the planets requiring anything high-tier to build, like HSE :)


[06-Apr-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mr.Asbestos**:	thanks


[06-Apr-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	There is OS-099c which only needs MCG but is very far


[06-Apr-23 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Though Im not sure where the original AR came from


[06-Apr-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	probably one of those boot strap planets, which would suck for the person doing it, it wasn't until about a year ago that we could fully demolish a base, you could remove all the buildings, but the core module still existed...


[06-Apr-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	It was done via throwaway accounts. I believe one was called something like Argon Pirates, according to rain.


[06-Apr-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure, they only want one left nut for it. HE3 asking price is absolutely obnoxious as of late.


[06-Apr-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Eh, considering INS prices that isn't awful. Things in general have just gotten more expensive.


[06-Apr-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	But if you want to get your own supply, VH-043e is just next door and is a pretty decent HE3 source.


[06-Apr-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, you’re better off buying FF and making your own SF.


[06-Apr-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Since this is a personal use scenario, and FF manufacturing with the turd margins from buying HE3 only makes sense if you’re selling mass quantities.


[06-Apr-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That or just digging up TS and refining it into HE3 if you don’t need the space for anything else. Since I “do” happen to know your situation and do know you can’t use 500 area of FP’s anyhow yet, lol


[06-Apr-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	all the FOD is here, on Avalon


[06-Apr-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	and if you want some AR, let me know, I have a good amount on Montem, and more on XG-452f

**Rannepear**:	Do what to the POPR?


[17-May-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Probably referring to the pioneer shortage.


[17-May-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	They are low but not in deficit.. But I see now


[17-May-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Definitely need to bump up the program for more happiness, or meet more needs, or the education out will give us a pioneer shortage again.


[17-May-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Edu out will be a bit north of 1k, and we only have 500 spare laying around. Without the open jobs the happiness will be under 70% with the status quo so no immigration to offset the edu out.


[17-May-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Think Digging will manage it just fine as he has for the past however many months :D


[17-May-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I was just making a joke about the sudden increase in bases that must have happened to make a small shortage, since population increased this week, but we now have open jobs


[18-May-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Ive been tricked many times by the report but there are actually no open jobs ATM. The pop report shows open jobs BEFORE migration in. So the jobs were covered by incoming PIOs (prior to the report there were not enough PIOs at least per the last minute before the new POPR)


[18-May-23 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	If you go attempt to build a building, youll see there are still workers in the buffer (not many but never the less)...


[18-May-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	There are 524 unemployed workers (at least at the moment the POPR dropped)


[18-May-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, no, I was just referring to the fact that the education out will be more than our buffer of unemployed workers next POPR “resulting in” a worker shortage next week. Since the only reason we saw immigration in this week was the open jobs we had last week giving happiness a little upwards tickle. As you said earlier though, I’m sure digginglake has it under control. It’s not like they’ve never flipped on festivities 3 before to do a short boost.


[18-May-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	tbh the plan was to see whats healthy in the market and COLIQ into that


[20-May-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, metallurgy in Hortus (Hortus is this system) is a big fat no.


[20-May-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	but yeah your concern concerns me what did i do or not do


[20-May-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Promitor is the main planet in the system, it's a breadbasket world. LOTS of agriculture output, very fertile, relatively abundant water.


[20-May-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So it's good for victualers and carbon farmers.


[20-May-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Avalon is a more or less worthless rock, outside of having no environmental conditions outside the green, that was colonized to process all the agriculture goods coming off of promitor into food.


[20-May-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So Prom is agriculture, Avalon is Food Industries.


[20-May-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	i mindlessly clicked through, would the market data i can get here be irrelevant?

[20-May-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Less irrelevant, and more....it's going to be almost impossible to do metallurgy "at all" on this planet. Literally everything will need to be imported and exported.

**M4RC0_P0L0**:	that's fine


[20-May-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	i'm not dead set on anything, i just needed a way to see whats healthy in the market


[20-May-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	then reset to producing that


[20-May-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	...unless the decisions i've made are permanent...?! which they aren't... right?


[20-May-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nope, you can explode everything and start over.


[20-May-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	so my strategy isn't top down retarded and i'm safe??


[20-May-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You're just not going to learn a lot of market data here, because Hortus is so NOT a metallurgy system. Even the materials you'll need to import aren't particularly abundant or cheap here like they'd be in areas more focused around metallurgy.


[20-May-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	no it's not that i wanna do anything in particular


[20-May-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	i just needed data to know what to reroll into


[20-May-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	didn't wanna pick anything without anything to go off


[20-May-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, do you have something you'd "like" to do? Almost anything can work, it's just where do you start as that thing


[20-May-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	after VERY surface level research it seems Foods the way to go


[20-May-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	then try my hand at manufacture once i know what i'm doing


[20-May-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There are other things with potentially better returns, but RAT's (food) are decently profitable, and VERY reliable.


[20-May-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're directly consumed by the first 3 (of 5) tiers of workers, and the food that the last 2 need include RAT's in their manufacture.


[20-May-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	the flavoured meal stuff?


[20-May-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	RAT here being the 3 letter code for ration. Type MAT RAT into a buffer to see what I mean. FIM and MEA are the foods for engineers (ENG) and scientists (SCI), and they use RAT's in their production chain.


[20-May-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	ah i see


[20-May-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	is there a way to check price history of goods in CX?


[20-May-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes...but I'm never sure what is PRO only and what is free.


[20-May-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Click chart on the right of the entry for the material on the CX


[20-May-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Alternatively CXPC (which is CX price chart) followed by the item code and the CX code separated by a period.


[20-May-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So CXPC RAT.IC1 for RAT's at Hortus


[20-May-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	yeah ik i can see that, but a graph instead?


[20-May-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	it was more of an aesthetic thing, this info'll obv do


[20-May-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Graph instead? Clarify what you're looking for?


[20-May-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	so like a graph of a mat's price history for example


[20-May-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It is a graph of the history?


[20-May-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	At least back as far as half a year, after 180d it doesn't track


[20-May-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Do you know how to read one of those charts?


[20-May-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	so this might be PRO only thing, cuz i only see blocks of info that basically show the ATH, the PA and ATL, also volume and other things


[20-May-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Type CXPC RAT.IC1 into a buffer and tell me what you get


[20-May-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**M4RC0_P0L0**:	thank you


[20-May-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Suskueve**:	is it possible to expand production too fast so you dont get all the workers u need? i have all the habitation i need and all consumables that they need but im missing like a third of the workers i should have T^T


[22-May-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	Yeah, I think if the planet doesn't have enough population to handle the jobs you just produced, then you're gna have some open jobs


[22-May-23 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Suskueve**:	welp i guess there isnt much i can do about that then


[22-May-23 01:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	new workers will be distributed (or taken away) when weekly population report kicks in, next one coming in 2 days


[22-May-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	if Happiness is above 70% at the time of report, Pioneers population will grow

**bazdakka**:	opps, wrong planet


[22-May-23 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so, when your building a new building, and you see the number in brackets next to how many workers the building needs, that is how many you can pull out of the worker reserve pool that week, if you can't pull more workers, then during the population report, any remaining workers will be distributed out, this is to prevent someone looking at a report, but not knowing that one person has dropped an entire bases worth of workers that week, preventing others from getting any, it's still possible 10 people did that, but the risk is reduced


[22-May-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Not really much to add beyond what has already been said. Fortunately pioneers tend to be fairly responsive to open jobs, so hopefully if you are looking to get pioneers you should get them all in 2 days (although I'm still planning on scheduling a Festivities 3 and upgrade the SST a bit, since demand for Pioneers is increasing and I'd like a bigger buffer so we don't run into these issues).

**DiggingLake**:	POPR looks decent. Everyone should have their Pioneers now, and nothing is in decline. I'm still going to upgrade the SST a bit more, since I think it is necessary, and unless anyone feels particularly strongly against it I'm going to queue Festivities 3 up after the current program.


[24-May-23 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	looks decent? 1086 open jobs for pio? I have my workers so far, but other won´t


[24-May-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	The "open jobs" is without the added population


[24-May-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	So current PIO unemployment is -1086 + 4102


[24-May-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	So there's more PIO than needed currently


[24-May-23 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	At least, i think that's how it works


[24-May-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yes, that's right. Another way to tell is to open the base construction menu. It shows (301) available PIOs for me.


[24-May-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jul-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	haha ya i thought of doing the same but fuel hasn't failed me yet


[02-Jul-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, welcome. I see you're a new player. As a suggestion, I would recommend COLIQing almost anywhere other than here. This planet is...if not outright hostile to new players, it's a very hard start. Virtually no meaningful resources to extract, sourcing large amounts of food processing inputs can be difficult from the CX, and no bonuses to manufacturing (what you'd usually be doing if you needed to source everything from the CX).


[02-Jul-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you have a business plan that works...don't let me dissuade you from doing it, I just imagine this will be one of the rougher start options.


[02-Jul-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Specifically, this is usually the "second" planet people on the food industries track take after starting on Promitor. Crops are grown there and then shuttled here for processing into RAT's.


[02-Jul-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	ya I realized a little to late I came for the TS to refine FF but no money in it but ive just been heavy market trading been working out a little better


[02-Jul-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, keep in mind TS is basically the "bootstrap" material for the fuel industry for super early game. In the early game, refining HE3 from TS is the only way to get it. HE3 exists in its natural state in the game though, just on gas giants. So until AEF production has begun, TS processing is the only way to get HE3. So now that the universe is developed, refining FF out of TS is...uniquely inefficient and therefore not particularly profitable.


[02-Jul-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	ya i realized after my first run i had to scrap my extractor it was a mess :( now i focus on ST


[02-Jul-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	And grabbed a pp1 to min. cost for expansion


[02-Jul-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	but thanks ill have to try to get out to one cause with out it FF only makes me like 200 a line


[02-Jul-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A bit too late since you're already running a PP1, but keep in mind it's almost always a good idea to try and match your planets CoGC


[02-Jul-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For example, dropping a FP and producing DW with imports, selling that and buying Bfabs would leave you in a better financial state then making Bfabs yourself here.


[02-Jul-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you're interested in continuing to grow into fuel refining as you get larger, please note VB-778B. That one has a fuel refining CoGC. VH-043e is a good source of natural HE3 (although very expensive to set up on). H is usually readily available locally.


[02-Jul-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	or Hydron, but that is also expensive to set up and to keep up with logistics.


[02-Jul-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, I don't recommend setting up on Hydron without a substantial fleet, or a customer buying from you direct who has a substantial fleet.


[02-Jul-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	but with that teken care of it is the cheapest option in the long run for H


[02-Jul-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	Not only is it expensive to set up on, it is expensive to repair


[02-Jul-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I still recommend simply buying from the CX. Supplies are readily available, the price is the cheapest in the galaxy by a decent margin, and sourcing from the CX incentivizes the people already there to continue producing an supplying the market, which aids in keeping prices affordable.


[02-Jul-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	I have 13 REF on Prom and 14 EXT on Avalon. H and AMM are cheap to get although GAL has been an issue recently but setting up a base on Boucher will take care of that. I have no problems selling fuel or making money on the CX.


[02-Jul-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Ill stick out fuels for now but thanks for the advise everyone worse comes to worse ill restart be for now im staying afloat


[02-Jul-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Crazy question, why are you running REF's on Prom instead of the planet 1 jump away that's built for REF's? Your output would go way up and your cost per unit would decrease.


[02-Jul-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, nevermind, I see now. Saw your user age and not your company age, missed the COLIQ


[02-Jul-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	Logistics and time spent in game. HOR has the cheapest consumables in the galaxy, I can login and send a ship of fuel to the station and sell in less than 1 hour. The bases basically run themselves. I did make more credits when I did the FRM and RIG on Prom and the FP on Avalon, but it wasn't that much more. I can skim the buys on the CX and have everything done in 15 minutes. How much time do you spend in game?


[02-Jul-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	Granted I am not running a multi planet empire like yourself lol


[02-Jul-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Was going to say, significantly more than 15 minutes...but I also have a dozen players on contracts and 18 permits, so....takes a bit of time =)


[02-Jul-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	but if it was just about money i would just print it making software or drones


[02-Jul-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I just love efficiency, efficiency efficiency, so with a Fuel Industries planet 1 jump away, I get twitchy seeing a planet filled with REF's. Twitch twitch, lol


[02-Jul-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Ya i ran REF here cause I thought TS would be better


[02-Jul-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	i spend like a couple hors a day but thats just cause im still looking through stuff


[02-Jul-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	haha I have OCD to which is why I am trying to minimize my exposure to the game. This is like the 3rd thing and time I am trying out "The Plan", I have to limit myself or I will get sucked into it again


[02-Jul-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	@HamletsFather a friend showed them to me


[02-Jul-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nothing wrong with running a few REF's here. I had 3 at one point making HE3/FF when I was in early days. Of course, fuel was almost always 16+ per unit then too, lol


[02-Jul-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	Great, its good to go throu you options and their cost / return beforehand.


[02-Jul-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	True, but I am just a small fish trying to push down fuels prices. 14-16/u was not that long ago


[02-Jul-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	how quick question do do shipment runs do i have to be pro or just be on here longer


[02-Jul-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	to teke or post shipments and buy/sell on the local markets you need pro


[02-Jul-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	*take


[02-Jul-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Thank you


[02-Jul-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	if you are looking to just take shipments or buy on the LM you can buy pro for 1 month and once it lapses you will always have basic


[02-Jul-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	BASIC has access to accepting LM ads, and posting shipping ads at CXs


[02-Jul-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	and you can also accept personal contracts sent from pro players with basic.


[02-Jul-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	it also makes joining a corporation and receiving help from players much easier


[02-Jul-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	thanks that helps wasn't sure if id lose my abilites if it lapsed


[02-Jul-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You lose a large number of PRO benefits when it lapses, but contracts are retained except for "sending" direct contracts and issuing contracts on planets.

[02-Jul-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	was extra wondering for a friend i have whos in OF-375 3 jumps from us in OZ makes sense for him to take contracts if hes coming all the way here


[02-Jul-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	it depends. if his ship is standing around unused it might be worth it to send one and take contracts, but going back and forth is most likely not worth it. also It really depends wich contracts they take. there is no generall answer.


[02-Jul-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Thats fair ive seen a couple coming back here from the station when i had free cargo space


[02-Jul-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	does fuel uses take weight into account


[02-Jul-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, but not on a starter ship.


[02-Jul-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A starter ships engine will hit the G-max for the design, with plenty of extra engine "oomph" left over, such that even when fully laden it still hits the design G-max. And the game calculates all that stuff off your ships acceleration.


[02-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	also: don't underestimate the repair costs that will hit you when your ship goes to 80%. Hull plates do cost money.


[02-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So until you modify the ship to have a higher G-max which it might not be able to reach while loaded, or a larger cargo hold to make it so you can't reach G-max under load....it just doesn't care.


[02-Jul-23 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Thanks I didn't know how complicated ship building was cause I cant use it yet


[02-Jul-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	BLU in a buffer


[02-Jul-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Even though you can't build anything, you can play around with the system.


[02-Jul-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Then you can take a BLU design and go into test mode with it to see how it will handle with a cargo load. The design specs can be highly misleading as to performance when you get into LCB's and WCB's, since an extra 2 or 3 KT of extra mass will play merry havoc with acceleration numbers


[02-Jul-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Damn thanks! Ill def. play around id love a long haul freighter some day


[02-Jul-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Do keep in mind, if you ever plan to go with PRO, but you only plan to buy a month of it and then be BASIC.


[02-Jul-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Pro players can upgrade over HQ5, So stockpile materials to build HQ's over 5 so you'll have them after you revert to BASIC. Also, only PRO players can upgrade ships. So get the upgrade materials for your ships before going PRO.


[02-Jul-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If, however, you don't mind doing it twice, you can upgrade once early to get contracts, and then again later on when you have those materials stockpiled.


[02-Jul-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or you can be crazy like me and just pay it every month =)


[02-Jul-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jul-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Its been great to be your governor for this time, but I've been burning out on PrUn recently, leading to lower activity levels, and so I thought it best to step down before I ended up missing something important.

**bazdakka**:	it's part of the reason governors will almost always be voted back in, if they ran the planet somewhat ok, no major shortages, then they did a good job


[15-Jul-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when a governor steps down, best bet for the new one is reach out and talk to the old one and see what he was maintaining things at, then do the same thing


[16-Jul-23 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	for more details, don't overrun the population infrastructure, excess population does nothing but use up the happiness, etc, of the workers for no benefit. keep a small buffer so new people can set up new bases extra, and don't have open jobs if possible (higher tiers it's more questionable, but that shouldn't be a problem here)


[16-Jul-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I don't know the lowest they can go, but the governors here have been anti-tax


[22-Jul-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Might be at minimum tax limit right now as the planets in faction space


[22-Jul-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	yeah i think it's at minimum


[22-Jul-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	very lucrative BDE contract up


[22-Jul-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, from a purely technical standpoint, avalon needs less taxes. One, each production line on a FP takes less employees than on a FRM, so tax revenue per supported pop is greater here. Also, prom is a heavily settled starter, which means a lot of dead weight abandoned bases not producing tax income but still tying up workers.

[23-Jul-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Mmm nice


[23-Jul-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That is nice, since taxes are basically as low as they can go (yes, there is a minimum in faction space), and, at least eyeballing it real quick, looks like around a 50-60K profit against upkeep materials, so that would pay for....some or all of the program (not sure on the cost since it scales).


[23-Jul-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And I could be off on the upkeep cost as well. I literally just eyeballed it real quick right now, lol


[23-Jul-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	Festivities II is 52,942 ICA


[23-Jul-23 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kolqpq**:	So the "barely there" taxes are enough to pay for both POPI and regular festivities? That's nice. By the way, for curiosity's sake, can the governor tell if the taxes are coming from PIOs or TECs or FP?


[23-Jul-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, there is exactly fuck all ability to audit the tax income.


[23-Jul-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	closest you can do is seeing how many are employed with the pop report


[23-Jul-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jul-23 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i mean with increments like that, its easy to do reselling.


[24-Jul-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	probably trying to give people an incentive to buy quickly


[24-Jul-23 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The less visible part is probably how much stock he has left ready to under sell the relisters


[24-Jul-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	This is a great way to tell relisters to leave this essential (at least in HRT) good alone


[25-Jul-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	How is it easy to do reselling? Sure, you can come in and buy up the 1K and relist it...and maybe turn 20K or so in profit on a 300-400K investment if you manage to sell it before I list another pile under you. Or you can tempt fate and run it all the way up and buy it out all the way out to the top so you can make some real profits...on the stuff you bought at the bottom, and PRAY I don't have a giant pile I'm sitting on.


[25-Jul-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Kind of like OVE's. I list it in lots of 2K. You'd shit your pants if I ever listed the entire pile, lol


[25-Jul-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	be careful of OZ-189A, the planet has high temp, this makes every building way more expensive as that is the most expensive planetary fault to fix, this carries onto repairs as well


[29-Jul-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's a good resource tap though, and for FEO, it's overpriced, there are cheaper places you can get FEO that while they produce less, the lower production is so much cheaper that it still makes more money, less so for the LST as there aren't as good of locations nearby to get it. it is however one of the best places in the region to get HAL, which is the only way to get CL which is used in quite a few different production chains

[29-Jul-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sounds good man, I know the other people on Avalon won't mind that ;]


[29-Jul-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I offer only slightly less than HRT ask price, but doesn't cost to ship to CX, as I said, could make more putting up offer price on HRT CX, or shipping to MOR, ANT, BEN, but that requires effort to do (ship time, fuel, dealing with other currencies, waiting on the sale if your putting up offer price, etc), I'm offering a less effort way to sell, though in limited amounts. is it a great deal, no, but I think it is at least acceptable for both of us (I buy low enough I can still turn a profit at the other end, you make an acceptable amount on RAT production, hopefully)


[29-Jul-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If a single player could govern multiple planets, problem solved....but with 1 rock per player....well.....


[03-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What was the change on that?


[03-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	adding 1 to food industries.  The taxes are break even at best


[03-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I can't speak for everyone, but if you're not covering the tax bill, don't be shy about giving it a bit more of a hike. I wouldn't bat an eyelash at anything up to 20 right now if it were necessary.


[03-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if you could provide some numbers showing it was needed, I'd swallow probably up to 30 without complaint.


[03-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No one bitches about the taxes on RE on Boucher, and if that were equalized out for pops per production line, I think it would work out to something like 21 on food industries here


[03-Aug-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	Festivities II program is like 53k every week so that alone is around 215k or so a month in cash and easy to calculate.  We are averaging like 220k a week in taxes.  I'd have to run the numbers on soil, dw and all the other stuff to get an exact readout

**Zuul**:	Well, like I said, anything up to 20 for me, personally, I don't even need you to tell me why. The planet right now is being run at tax levels where you're more or less subsidizing it.


[03-Aug-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hell, we don't even reach 1 ICA per RAT in taxes until somewhere north of 30 if my memory is working.


[03-Aug-23 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	Yeah, 300k was sent over from the previous governor so was easy to get started


[03-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Actually, I think we hit 1 ICA per RAT at 40 in taxes. .25 per run per 1 in tax rate. So at 40 we'd be at 10 per run. If I were you, I'd just kick the tax rate straight to 20....and if you're turning a profit afterwards and feel "bad" about it, you can lower them later. Like I said above, we have a shortage of governors. No one is going to WANT to do it if they're losing money. So long as the plates keep spinning I'm fine with it.


[03-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	I wouldn't mind running but I'll already be gov of another planet


[03-Aug-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If anyone feels otherwise, let them speak up....but I don't imagine anyone is going to tell you that you need to be subsidizing this out of your own pocket.


[03-Aug-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kolqpq**:	Speaking for myself I'm fine with higher taxes but I can't help but shake my head at the FP tax being higher than the others. Both the CoGC and the fact that FPs have less PIOs reduce the effective tax rate per PIO in comparison to other industries. Although I doubt much of anyone does anything else here so whatever.


[03-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The CoGC doesn't alter the effective tax rate for people with bases. The tax payment is set by the base time for the job, and ignores efficiency improvements from all sources. Technically, the CoGC increases the effective tax rate from the perspective of the governor (more tax revenue incoming) because that set tax is being paid more often because of the efficiency boost from the CoGC.


[03-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So no matter how much efficiency you have, the per unit tax remains fixed for the base owner, but tax revenue increases for the governor by virtue of more work being done.


[03-Aug-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which, for anyone who was aware of some of the Montem shenanigans is part of the reason why the "chem people need to pay their fair share" for having the CoGC was so utterly hilarious. Everyone who matches up with the CoGC by default pays more taxes into the upkeep fund by being more efficient. (Another benefit of purely mono-industry bases by the way, the governor can afford to keep taxes lower)

**Gasgano**:	If anyone is going for Avalon in next 24h i've put an ad for 1t/0,5m for 1500 ICA, cause i forgot sth important :D

[03-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Want me to cut you reciprocal contracts for 500 PG then? I have enough here to last me awhile, so I can give it to you to get started and you just return it when your shipment shows up


[03-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gasgano**:	Nah, it's not that important to create an imbalance this big, thank you though!


[03-Aug-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I should at some point give being a governor ago. Any guides anywhere people recommend?


[03-Aug-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Other than asking previous governors of your planet or asking in the Discords. Closest thing to a guide is an accounting sheet available on the third parties page


[03-Aug-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kolqpq**:	@Zuul That's what I meant by effective tax rate. Since CoGC industry produce faster they pay more tax while using the same amount of population, and indirectly of POPI and Programs costs. Although on the other hand there's also the CoGC maintenance cost, which in fairness should be paid by the people using the CoGC so I guess it all works out in the end whatever.


[03-Aug-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, I was confused because you had said "reduce the effective tax rate", where it would be increased. We were both talking the same thing though.


[03-Aug-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	political promises...


[03-Aug-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	COGC and POPI upkeep costs are largely determined by the wanton level of upgrades applied and the pecentage of upkeep materials delivered. It might seem fair that those benefiting the most from the facilities provided should pay for their upkeep, hoever it's just another issue of the "problem of the commons".


[03-Aug-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You could organize an upkeep coalition of players on the planet, but that's alot of work. An easier solution would involve just attracting new companies to fill out at least 1 permit on a given planet.


[03-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of course, being a governor on a packed starter planet definitely helps. By my guestimates, Promitor is getting around the ballpark of 1.4 mil ICA to devote to upkeep and upgrade costs, whereas Avalon (in its current state) is maybe generating ~500k ICA in production fee revenues.


[03-Aug-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Forming a governing corporation on a planet to open membership to those willing, and able to contribute towards upkeep, while benefitting from a corporate HQ production bonus is also a viable option.


[03-Aug-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sadly I believe Avalon is one of the few planets you cannot build an Corp HQ on


[03-Aug-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I call bull on that.


[03-Aug-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you have plots available, you should be able to put up a corp hq.


[03-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's kinda why its stated in the esoteric language of the APEX wiki, that you can't build on starter planets, because they have no plots available at all, if ever, like Promitor.


[03-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Uhhhhh


[03-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's on the building itself in the corporation projects


[03-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And no, you can't build it on starter planets, plots or no plots.


[03-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Is Harmonia a starter planet?


[03-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, your tax income numbers are VASTLY overinflated.


[03-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Perhaps to the tune of double


[03-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Highly likely, considering it was named 861 days ago....but....I'm not sure, because I didn't pay any attention to what the starter planets are for ANT


[03-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I just said what I said as the previous governor even said he tried to put an HQ here and it didn't work.


[03-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I performed an average of my weekly production fees numbers, assuming a normalized distribution. but I don't have access to gov figures anywhere.


[03-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You're not counting for dead accounts.


[03-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If the base facilities aren't running, they're not producing any taxes


[03-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're just employing workers and eating upkeep supplies while contributing nothing. It's even worse the more popular the planet.


[03-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ooph.


[03-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, for Avalon, you've likely estimated by at least double.


[03-Aug-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For promitor....probably somewhere between 2x and 3x.


[03-Aug-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I was estimating everyone having a full plot, with activity.


[03-Aug-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Maybe even 4x on Prom, since Prom is mostly FRM's which provide VERY little tax income over a full active plot.


[03-Aug-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	For ANT, you can't build a corp HQ on Deimos or Phobos


[03-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I thought Corporate HQ was only allowed in factionless space


[03-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The way they word it is sorta poor in my opinion. It's less faction space, and more planets that were considered starter planets originally


[03-Aug-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	ah


[03-Aug-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I wasn't here to know what the original starter planets are so, other than the obvious ones, I had to listen to FireFreak's list he has in the Discords

***Anxuiz** joined.*


[03-Aug-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think you can probably look at when it was named. I assume any planets named on server start were starters.


[03-Aug-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If it was named afterwards, it likely wasn't an original starter. I haven't tested that theory though


[03-Aug-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Verdant was named before Avalon (neither of which were on server start) but Avalon is considered a starter


[03-Aug-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Other starters were probably named prior as some were in the previous universe, thus not having a time of when they were named, like Promitor and Montem


[03-Aug-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	Antares: Deimos, Phobos Hortus: Promitor, Avalon, Berthier, Nova Honshu Moria: Montem, Vallis, Prism Benten: Proxion, Gibson, Umbra, Katoa


[03-Aug-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	i think those are the original starter planets


[03-Aug-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	is what firefreak always says


[03-Aug-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye


[03-Aug-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I guess I just find it weird that some of the original starter planets were not named at the start. Which is sorta confusing as it helps you tell that some are "main planets" when they have a name and aren't named by anyone


[04-Aug-23 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	faction contract, cost me 3 MCG for 5 faction points, 1k ICA, and 33 FF, could have done 1 MCG if I wanted to be cheaper... faction contract to supply either building materials or upkeep to something, so the smallest amount I could be bothered trying to drag was 3 MCG into the CoCG...


[04-Aug-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	talking about lack of governors, another planet I'm on lost it's governor recently (he moved to governing another planet), and no one stepped up to replace him at the time... we are now onto our second election cycle and still no one runs for governor


[04-Aug-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	being a governor just seems so intimidating


[04-Aug-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I was planning to try at some point, I just didn't want to on one of my existing planets...


[04-Aug-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	was planning on doing so on a planet that I needed to develop to achieve my goals on


[04-Aug-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	It highly depends on the planet how hard the job of the governor is. If you have a planet with a clear purpose and less then 30 Bases it's quite a chill job. Having a Mayor planet with 200 or 300 bases on it is a different thing.


[04-Aug-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, planet that needs one that I'm looking at has 8 bases on it


[04-Aug-23 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I've mentioned I'd consider it on the planet in question, and that I'd want to try and grow a higher tier population so I can move some of my buildings off another planet with the same CoCG since they take up so much space that could be used by lower tier buildings that I really need more of in that region (or at least moved off a non CoCG planet in the same system since I ran out of space for them due to the higher tier planets)


[04-Aug-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not like I didn't already have enough things to do in the game this weekend as is, I have a ton of stuff I need to plan out because I misread a decimal last week)


[04-Aug-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	replanning half my empires bases to more effectively use their space wasn't in the books, it was only supposed to be a quarter that was effected by that stuff up


[04-Aug-23 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's what developing desolate worlds is for, however you're otherwise limited when a mass of players decide to colonize the world for other purposes.


[04-Aug-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, with only 1 exception, I've been quite lucky, problem is the desolate planets in that region aren't good to settle, plus permit limits, and if I really want to grow the planet quickly, I'd need to govern it to grow desired pops quickly, it's why I've been holding off on stepping up as governor on planets I'm already on, I choose those because they already did what I wanted them to do

[09-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	my thought process was alot of people are going from planet to MOR rather then planet to HRT to MOR


[09-Aug-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lots of people going to MOR from here are going there "because" they already have a cargo that they're self producing. Most of the people buzzing through here with cargo room to spare are those doing shipping from Prov->Ava. So they might take it, if there's no other intra-system traffic coming off of Avalon and they're willing to FTL.


[09-Aug-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ChristoAmor**:	Hey, I noticed technicians are in decline and I was looking to invest into InvitroPlants. Is anyone else interested in building up the technician population? I want to contribute towards the upkeep to increase them but I'm a new player and can't contribute all of what's necessary.


[09-Aug-23 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well there's alot of shipments going there atm - it's unusual in that I haven't seen it before.


[09-Aug-23 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You'll have trouble shipping it at bottom tier rates. In-system jobs might have enough spare capacity in that those who have room in one-direction might pick up those jobs if they have nothing else better to do. Out of system jobs require some sort of competition to attract the business.


[09-Aug-23 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For instance, a full load for 4-5k to Moria will be competing against a half-load at 8k to Antares. If there's only one ship coming into to HRT to do shipping jobs, you'll be hard pressed to get items shipped to Moria, in that scenario.


[09-Aug-23 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But who knows? \o/


[10-Aug-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, I keep seeing these cut throat rate shipping jobs. In my younger days, I wouldn’t have “ever” taken a CX to CX run for anything under 8k (and that was in hungry times), 10k was pretty much my minimum for a cargo from adjacent CX’s, and 12k for the cross CX route. I know the cheaper ones “do” eventually move (since I see them leaving the LM), it can just take awhile sometimes.


[10-Aug-23 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's funny.


[10-Aug-23 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For whatever reason, rates for in-system and to-CX-system have largely dropped, like you said, aside from a few "golden customers" who pay top rate, since they've been through that grind before, and know how it feels.


[10-Aug-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The rates from a dead-end system, like Boucher, to CX have been steadily increasing, fwiw.


[10-Aug-23 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However that's not my point. The bottom rate shipments are easily found with deadlines of 7+ days. The ones that you see on the LM are less than bottom rate. It costs more in current exchange prices, for fuel and repairs, to ship cross CX than's what's being offered in recompense.


[10-Aug-23 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Basically, pay me, and do my work, so that you can play the game.


[10-Aug-23 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	MAYBE an LCB or WCB fit ship can pick those things up for a decent rate, but there's usually better work out there for those ships anyways.

**Zuul**:	Nah, doesn't need improved. Needs supplied. We're on pure DW for safety. Needs OFF. We're sufficient for a holding pattern right now alternating between PF2/3


[11-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, 10% of 27


[11-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ahh


[11-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Growth will require running PF3 for awhile, or supplying OFF.


[11-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	i can put in some Prephabs in a day or so i have PF 1-2 on planet but it'll take a bit to make\


[11-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Adding more prefabs won't help.


[11-Aug-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	oh i though it took prefabs so upgrade


[11-Aug-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, if you build to level 10 SST and stay on pure DW, that would give another...oh...4% safety fulfillment or so


[11-Aug-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	we are having problems upkeeping the current level, upgrades wont help it seems


[11-Aug-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don't know that it's problems, so much as it's just not being done because the current settings allow for maintaining a rough status quo.


[11-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	its 270 OFF and 270 SUn for upkeep per upkeep cycle on safety station :/


[11-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	so what does need to be done sorry im new


[11-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nothing. You don't need to do anything at all. At "new" TEC's shouldn't even be something you're thinking about.


[11-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	^


[11-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	270 OFF per 3 days, and 270 SUN per 10 days. Doesn't really need both of them though, 1 or the other would be plenty to bring safety up to a happy growth spot.


[11-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That would get you to roughly 70% safety fulfillment.


[11-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Infirmary could use TUB's as well, to be honest, at least if you're wanting TEC worker growth.


[11-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	oof thats a quarter a mil per 3 days for off alone


[11-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Who the hell is selling OFF for 1K/u?


[11-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You might want to double check your math a wee bit, lol


[11-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**worvand**:	24k per 3 days


[11-Aug-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TcEnterprize**:	haha know you'd notice eventually


[11-Aug-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	IVP products just don't have a ton of demand right now.


[11-Aug-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	More than they did half a year ago, but still not much at all


[11-Aug-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	ya ive noticed take it most people who need them have the means of making it themselves


[11-Aug-23 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....yes, and no. If you need them you're making enough money to not really care about paying the premium to have someone else make the stuff. It's just that there's plain not a lot of SCI in the universe right now to consume them. More than there were, for sure, but still not many


[11-Aug-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Fair, well Ill pass on what ive learned. Thanks for the info as always!


[11-Aug-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	250 t / 130 m3 available flying to HRT station, departing in 20m


[12-Aug-23 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	An undeveloped market cuts both ways. People who have the means to do so will reserve room from their otherwise more profitable ventures to purely produce TEC/SCI consumables, due to inconsistent market supply. Producers will likewise scurry to more stable markets due to inconsistent demand.


[12-Aug-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you would want to develop that market, start off with more competition on the bid-side. It'll attract suppliers if there's enough going on. If you don't need the product itself, but can forward a decent chunk of change with nothing do to, you can then relist those filled bids. Getting commodities to market is one thing, but information within an assymetric space is also just as valuable. You might not be able to know what some, or most player's production outputs and inputs are, however you'll readily utilize current market orders and trends to justify upcoming operational decisions.


[12-Aug-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But that's just my conjecture of increasing market competition leading to increased production. Who knows if it'll work.


[12-Aug-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	seen artificial demand strategy not work in other games. from what ive seen if you want to kick start a market, a supplier has to sell at a tiny profit or at cost for awhile so people already producing switch to relying on others and some people go into useing the product instead of making their own. after that slight price increases bring the market into line


[12-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	one big problem is that most people that need those resources prefer to make them themselves. they have way more than enough money to setup the lines needed, and producing your own is more reliable than the market.


[12-Aug-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	is there anyone with TEC/SCI  that wishes something was more avaible in market


[12-Aug-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	know it seems silly but no way to know but ask  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[12-Aug-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Do you mean ENG/SCI or did you actually intend to ask about TEC/SCI?


[12-Aug-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I meant ENG/SCI.


[12-Aug-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For whatever reason, I value technicians more than engineers XD


[12-Aug-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Aug-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kolqpq**:	I value engineers  more than technicians because their picky eater tendencies are so profitable

**ArcturusRex**:	spacey ramen FTW!


[13-Aug-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	i was asking about TEC/SCI cause there supplies are the least sold on CX so if theres a commodity that is cumbersome to produce they might be more willing to buy it from CX


[13-Aug-23 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	but also willing to here ENG


[13-Aug-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if there was a better supply on the CX, since I often buy in bulk and then stock at the CX until I ship them to a base that needs them (I'm horribly unoptimized in that I store consumables at CX warehouse until they are needed), then I wouldn't need a IVP


[13-Aug-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	which commodity if you dont mind me asking


[13-Aug-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	general supply, I can do the various alcohols just fine (ALE, GIN, WIN), as well as MED and FIM myself, I've got 90% of what I need to make SC, but the ones I can't make are HMS, HSS, PDA and VG (why I wanted to IVP)


[13-Aug-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm not are sci consumables yet, or worrying about them either (though that may change in the near future)

**xflqr_**:	Okay but who the hell is doing food processing with engineers?


[16-Aug-23 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	odds are someone is just using the planet as a close to HRT to do more advance projects, still not sure who it is, and they decided that whatever they are making is valuable enough to not need the CoCG bonus, or are too short on permits to be able to spare one where they can get a CoCG bonus

[16-Aug-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of those listed being under the Chemistry, Construction, Manufacturing and Metallurgy industries, none of them make any sense due to Avalon's lack of resource density, and of competing planets (Nova Honshu, Berthier) being just a couple of jumps away. They're also anth-thetical to what those needing market funds would actually do on a planet like Avalon to get profits.


[16-Aug-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I do mininal FF refining here, but mostly food industries. Have only Pioneers at the moment


[16-Aug-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	On phone right now, so not gonna go through the plot numbers you put haha


[16-Aug-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Food Industies, Fuel Refining, and Resource Extraction (for C or mineral inputs to respective processes) make sense on Avalon. The outliers have likely setup massive plants that require large shipments in to maintain. If you weed out those who are large enough to do so, you might be able to figure out who's needing the engineers.


[16-Aug-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	neat, didn't know that one myself


[17-Aug-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	my guess why people would do some of these less common uses on Avalon is that want to use a glass STL ship to supply the base here instead of a full FTL ship


[17-Aug-23 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	used to be a major concern back before the universe unlocked access to scientists, as without them, you can't make FTL ships, this was before governor programs were a thing


[17-Aug-23 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	also back before steam release


[17-Aug-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	people planned out large parts of their empires around glass STL ships, or lots of shipping contracts


[17-Aug-23 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	some of those bases could be holdovers from then,  and the person just never converted them to something else


[17-Aug-23 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's also whyt the planet Cicre has a level 10 university, and 48% scientist unemployment, basically, a bunch of rich players decided to try and force the growth of scientists the slow way, and it worked, was very expensive, but it worked


[17-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	If memory serves, Proxion and Circe both tried to get the first scientists, but then Circe just ran away with it as SNF just plowed resources into scientists

[18-Aug-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	As I recall, there was a planet going for scientists in each region (Circe, Boucher, Phobos, and Proxion), but Proxion and Circe were the only ones really in contention for first. Boucher was on the back foot because it didn't start very early and was only really OIKOS doing it, and while Phobos had a broader coalition building scientists there was a degree of pride about investing more efficiently (which meant far less was invested into it than the frontrunners). Proxion got the early lead as the first one to start growing a scientist, but SNF overtook them quite rapidly with Circe once they started pouring resources into it as per their plan.


[18-Aug-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Then something like the second available scientist on Circe was vultured by someone else, and an update came out that not only made getting scientists far easier (introducing programs) but actually contained an exploit that made generating higher tier pops trivial (instead of the Education program multiplying the base education rate, it added to it).


[18-Aug-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	The combination led to a lot of the players involved in leading the race on both Proxion and Circe to lose interest in the game and stop playing, from what I understand.

**worvand**:	dought? what happened?


[21-Aug-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Magmadar** joined.*


[21-Aug-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	no idea, I think he's just commenting on the H2O price rising right now


[21-Aug-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	could also be a reference to everyone flipping towards RAT production right now, causing an increase in demand for water


[21-Aug-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	possibly but water was going up before the RAT war


[21-Aug-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	luckily I'm self-sufficent xD


[21-Aug-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same


[21-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	same


[21-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though having now seen the prices, I think it'll be a case of the price will be slower to make a correction due to everyone jumpingon the RAT bandwagon right now, it wil fix itself, but may take a while...


[21-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	holy cow i didnt even realize RAT went up


[21-Aug-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	lol, it's been a major topic for the last few days


[21-Aug-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	1 guy is holding the market almost to ransom, we're not sure why at this point...


[21-Aug-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	I'm usually disconnected from the happenings on the weekend, usually come in to stock and send ships


[21-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	What happens if we just feed him?


[21-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I think it was before the weekend this started though


[21-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	he places more orders


[21-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	interesting


[21-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and he's a fairly active player, so once an order is filled, he'll have a new one up fairly quickly


[21-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ashes**:	production will outpace him eventually, then RAT prices will crash


[21-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	he's basically just the market maker rn


[21-Aug-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, and he's holding a very small spread between prices, if it lasts a few more days, I can see a lot of fallout happening across the entire market as a result of this


[21-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i guess thats the benefit of having fuck you money


[21-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	this will drag the price of everything else up (quite a bit)


[21-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	pretty much


[21-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i'm nearly self sufficient for reasons like this


[21-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same


[21-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but some of the advance materials I get in will be effected, and some of them are used to make basic materials


[21-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	but i might build an extra couple FPs to make use of my overstock of my agri goods lol


[21-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	such like?


[21-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	mostly things like LST for NS production (I make my own NS, but need to buy LST for it), same with N, I buy raw resources in a lot of cases and do all the production myself


[21-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh i see, didnt you have js-572 for lst?


[21-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	although Bfab prices were already quite high, this will have fallout on those, while I make my own, it'll force those even closer to the upper MM price


[21-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, but that guy bases his price of the CX, yes, he is still a lot cheaper than the CX, to the point it's worth the trip


[21-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ashes**:	they already are, BBH is practically at MM sale price


[21-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	my lines are fairly safe, but some of the advance stuff I'm trying to set up (for ship building), I still haven't secured my own supply of


[21-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i see


[21-Aug-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a lot of other people haven't got all their supply lines sorted yet, so there will be fallout for them, pushing prices up down the line


[21-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a price spike like this will effect everything eventually (if it lasts long enough), it'll just take a bit to go through the system


[21-Aug-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	Yeah I can see that being an issue


[21-Aug-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and of course, this is artificial demand, as soon as he runs out of money (if that happens), or he pulls those orders down, the price will then crash, but it'll take longer for effected prices to go back down, since everyone would have set up RAT production to take advantage of the spike


[21-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	hopefully he gets bored sooner rather than later


[21-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	hopefully


[21-Aug-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	or course, he could be doing this to delibrately cause a market crash afterwards, since RAT prices were already rising, and while I like them that higher, they shouldn't be that high, when I started, RAT price on HRT sat around 45 ICA and was profitable, since everything else was cheap


[21-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	RATs were at 45?


[21-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	or 145?


[21-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	steam release was such a huge shock to the market it never recovered from it, and the raised prices became the new normal


[21-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	45


[21-Aug-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	people had mathed out that at below 40, it was better just to sell GRN to the lower MM


[21-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i see


[21-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	when was that


[21-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	steam release? over a year ago now


[21-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	ohh okay


[21-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i discovered this game via browser, but realized later it had a steam option too


[21-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same, I was one of the pre steam players


[21-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	cool thats dope


[21-Aug-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why I occasionally share stories that basically start as a 'back in my day we had...' (grandpa Simpson voice*


[21-Aug-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	lmao


[21-Aug-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I've been around a while, and saw what it was like before a lot of features were added to the game, they have changed how a lot of things are done now


[21-Aug-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	have you been thru a reset?


[21-Aug-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	no, I was one of very few people back then to not reset


[21-Aug-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	back then, the FAQ wasn't a thing, the spreadsheet with starter planets wasn't set up, government programs weren't around, ship upgrading didn't exist, and there were no planets with scientists on them


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	that's quite the difference


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it was accepted that 80% or more people would need to reset


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	im glad to not have needed to


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, and ghost plots weren't a thing


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	whats a ghost plot


[21-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	like if a planet is already full?


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	like the +# on promitor?


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	new players can start a base on any planet, even if there is no plots open


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh ok yeah i figured


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's basically so starter planets can always be settled on


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	makes sense


[21-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	back then, people competed for spots on Promitor


[21-Aug-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	that makes sense too lol


[21-Aug-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I was lucky, started while 2 were open and grabbed one of them


[21-Aug-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	where did you start?


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	now, the only people that will ever get a spot on Promitor are new players setting up their first base there


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Promitor


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh before ghost plots


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	for sure


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the lack of space on Promitor meant that other planets that weren't as good had to be used as well to make RAT


[21-Aug-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, base expansion also wasn't a thing, it was 1 permit, 1 base with 500 area, that was it


[21-Aug-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh damn


[21-Aug-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so yeah, no way Promitor/Avalon could keep up with the whole universes RAT demand, other planets got used for it as well, this resulted in BEN having almost the same price for RAT that HRT did on average


[21-Aug-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	since it was the opposite CX, it made the most sense since it was furthest from HRT, there was also a large corp working on setting up a huge chem setup in the area, and they subsidized a planet to set up HYFs on and another in system to set up FP on


[21-Aug-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	also, a lot of planets that have CoCGs now didn't have them, or any other infrastructure for that matter such as LMs, warehouses, or admin centers


[21-Aug-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	thats interesting, i was thinking of setting up an HYF + H2O set of planets


[21-Aug-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	look up Milways, about halfway between BEN and ANT


[21-Aug-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is another planet in system that has the other half of the CoCG combo


[21-Aug-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not sure where they get their water for it though


[21-Aug-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	is there a way to look up planets via name?


[21-Aug-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	PLI into a buffer


[21-Aug-23 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you don't add a planet code, it allows a search function to search for planet names


[21-Aug-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh cool


[21-Aug-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	between Promitor not being as powerful as it is now (more people now, base expansion, etc), a corp setting up a full HYF setup in a region to support them later on but not having yet built themselves up, etc, they had very low RAT prices in the BEN region


[21-Aug-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	because of a lower tier universe in general, ANT and BEN suffered a lot, the goods those regions were good at just weren't in high enough demand to justify selling stuff there


[21-Aug-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh isee


[21-Aug-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	how does a new CX get put into place?


[21-Aug-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	like if people wanted to setup shop in the far edges?


[21-Aug-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the 2 extras were dev added, it was part of a competition they held


[21-Aug-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	ohh okay


[21-Aug-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, they knew they didn't have the functionality to allow player built CXs, but they could add them as devs, so they held a competition to develop areas of the map, players would decide the regions to be contested, HUB and ARC are the winners


[21-Aug-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i see isee


[21-Aug-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	back then, C was a lot less valuable than it is now, and was almost always at the lower MM price


[21-Aug-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but as people have moved up the tech tree, products that have C as an early stage got more and more common, resulting in the strong C market you see today


[21-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	yeah i went in on that early


[21-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	manufacturing was also a lot less powerful, since the only goods made worth anything in that whole field was OVE and PE


[21-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	then when i saw it dipped down i went out


[21-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	but now i need a lot of it lmao


[21-Aug-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fuel refining was held by 2 people that brought he price so low no one else could get into the market, when they left (both at the same time), the market for that went absolutely nuts...


[21-Aug-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i refine SF and Im surprised how profitable it is


[21-Aug-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	while I'm sure your aware that people often use goods to change currencies, the most common one back then to do so with was fuel, this meant that pfuel in BEN was often more expensive than in other regions as people would sell goods at BEN, have nothing to buy there, so grab more fuel and bring that back with them, it happened so often that it caused fuel in BEN to be more expensive than anywhere else...


[21-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	that maeks sense lol


[21-Aug-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	when i was f2p for a bit i was wondering how to do the same, but i usually came up with a plan to what i'd purchase on the way back


[21-Aug-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, this was more of a case, BEN and ANT had nothing worth anything since no high tier industry existed


[21-Aug-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh okay


[21-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	everything was more expensive in those 2 regions due to them not producing anything worth buying


[21-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	is that still the case


[21-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i dont really travel over there


[21-Aug-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that and HRT did have a fledging fuel build at the time (same one that exists today, just without the CoCGs), so BEN main export was able to be made in a more active region


[21-Aug-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	no, they both have much better setups now


[21-Aug-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
***bazdakka** deleted this message.*


[21-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh okay


[21-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
***bazdakka** deleted this message.*


[21-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I botched that so badly I'm going to rewrite that


[21-Aug-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	lmao


[21-Aug-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so, while the goods on ANT and BEN tend to focus on higher tier goods, there is now actual demand for those goods, and the markets there are actually healthy


[21-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	ah


[21-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a lot of tthe chem based goods are made out in the BEN region, while a lot of higher tier metals are made in the ANT region (or MOR region, but they have different specialties)


[21-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	ok


[21-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	interesting


[21-Aug-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i literally havent gone farther than MOR or ANT


[21-Aug-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	I've only gone to ANT like twice


[21-Aug-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	MOR has good FE, and has poor FE, FE is better for Bfabs, ANT has good AL, MOR has poor AL, AL is also used in Bfabs, but not as good, but is also used in Lfabs


[21-Aug-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	things like that


[21-Aug-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	yeah i see


[21-Aug-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, both regions have access to the other metal, but those regions are where there is easy access on cheap planets to those metals


[21-Aug-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	for sure, ima go on break , ididnt want to leave you hanging


[21-Aug-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	thanks for the info and history grandp


[21-Aug-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	because of the low tier universe, and lack of programs to help grow higher tier pops, very few people even moved up to settler tier production, so Bfabs were 80% of the demand


[21-Aug-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	grandpa lol


[21-Aug-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and their was almost no Rfab or Afab demand, which meant little need for chem to make them


[21-Aug-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	thats my issue rn, making epo and stuff for rfabs


[21-Aug-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	now, their is Rfab and Afab need, so chem is needed to make a lot of them (look up EPO to see what I mean), this gave BEN a nice start, while a lot of high tier metals started coming out of ANT


[21-Aug-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that, combined with no ftl ship production (needed scientists), or ship upgrading, meant everyone was stuck with their 2 starter ships, and glass stl ships


[21-Aug-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so location was even more important than it was now, people had to figure out how to get by with just that, 4-6 bases was the limit most people could mange with just their ships, means a lot of older players mentored newer players in exchange for shipping their stuff (I miss that system, it was nice, even if I never benefited from it, I figured out a lot of things from chat, so never needed to be mentored)


[21-Aug-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	anyway, I'm off to bed, if you want more grandpa simpson like stories, let me know


[21-Aug-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	lmao thanks man


[21-Aug-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	or anyone else reading this for that matter


[21-Aug-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that or if any other older players want to share stories of things they remember, turn this chat into the sounding like the old folks home with stories about how things used to be (how many pre steam release players are reading this?)


[21-Aug-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	heck, back then, the HRTriangle was a new idea, I remember when someone was contacting me about setting it all up and everything, I was still to new to actually do much back then though


[21-Aug-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	these days, the HRTriangle is the core of a lot of peoples empire, at least on this planet


[21-Aug-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	i can see that


[21-Aug-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I started the Adalina and Berthier builds for branching in constructor from a Promitor start, it was known, but I was the first to really make it work (and even then I got the order wrong, going Berthier first)


[21-Aug-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	that doestn work out well


[21-Aug-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so these core ideas of where to expand weren't known back then like they were today


[21-Aug-23 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I made it work, and told people the correct way to do that build, and I know of quite a few that followed in my footsteps


[21-Aug-23 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**P-Money**:	I just built a base here because I learned about the food industries campaign


[22-Aug-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Wish I had known sooner


[22-Aug-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**P-Money**:	1/246


[22-Aug-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	not everyone on the planet talks here so the number is much lower


[22-Aug-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	also thats 246 empty plots


[22-Aug-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	oh right


[22-Aug-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	damn, refreshed my page and lost pmmg extended


[22-Aug-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ahh new version.


[22-Aug-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah, I think mainly reworking the way it detects stuff. Does it like FIO now


[22-Aug-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	cool. i was just looking for patch notes.


[22-Aug-23 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	legit have a hard time playing without pmmg extended. it adds so many QOL stuff


[22-Aug-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeed, very convenient


[22-Aug-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	uhh workforce is broken on it now :/ unless 57.6 + 17 somehow equals 510.1


[22-Aug-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	From what I heard, this is 1.8.0 and they're going to be releasing 1.8.1 in another day or so


[22-Aug-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ahh kk


[22-Aug-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Not sure if that's a known issue though...


[22-Aug-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	reading the discord, it looks like the workforce page really bugs out pmmg right now


[22-Aug-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	known bug


[23-Aug-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I wouldn't say that PMMG+ adds much functionality. It's data-driven analytics offer some benefit if you have not much mathematical understanding of the underpinning cyclical mechanics inherent in this game.


[23-Aug-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But, what is very decent regarding its features, is its XIT FIN buffer --- very useful in cross checking figures that Prunner provides.


[23-Aug-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	finally capped my 3 permits on avalon. 10 more fps and a bunch of storage

[23-Aug-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	What are you mainly making? Noticed you're handling a lotta water


[23-Aug-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I mean, that's a lotta GIN, right? :D


[23-Aug-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	26 frms on prom, 30 rigs on boucher, 2 fer, 35 fp and 5 wpls on ava and then a plastic and prefab2 plant on phantasm. specifically just kinda doing whatever floats my boat from day to day. seems easy to get lost in weird pyramid schemes of horizontal production...


[23-Aug-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	operation like this leaves alot more room for versatility and to flow with a changing market


[23-Aug-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	have seen enough people complain about how their 1 or 2 pinnacle operations being thrashed by manipulation, when it seems like a better idea to just...play the long game


[23-Aug-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	I'm a big proponent of triple permits per planet, rather than being on 15 planets


[23-Aug-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Phantasm still a 1 permit base, that's where my energy will go next after my water surplus clears a bit more space in my storages


[23-Aug-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	LOL I may be seeing the "triple permit" light before too long


[23-Aug-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Especially in CX systems


[23-Aug-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	right I can't speak to elsewhere, but at least in VH feels real nice


[23-Aug-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	@Roh reason i like pmmg extended is because of the different QOL stuff, shows price per unit in contracts, color codes contracts, adds ETA timers to ships and route scheduling, changes some item colors so they are easier to tell apart, in game calculator and will tell you how many days left of supplies you have left without going to a different page.

[23-Aug-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-23 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**worvand**:	tell your friend to not get caught


[24-Aug-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	yes, devs want low automated game interactions


[24-Aug-23 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i should say no auto game interactions, might want to tell your friend


[24-Aug-23 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	but damn it would be helpful in some cases


[24-Aug-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	i wouldnt here if it broke rules tbh lol it's not that big of a deal, but if, id gladly sell everything 1 each xd


[24-Aug-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	lol i only saw it on the agreement at the beginning of the game. they probably dont go after it unless its abused


[24-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	but damn 53$ to post ech coffee at 469 each really cuts into profits imo


[24-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Right, click counters probably arent on their short list atm


[24-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	there is a buffer anyway..


[24-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	anwayyy


[24-Aug-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	naa they probably dont want auto trades and arbitages to take over, those will put some players who like that part out


[24-Aug-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	ah thats true didnt think of it like that


[24-Aug-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i just wish we could preplan some actions to occur within like 24 hours, like ship arrives, i want it to be preplanned to dump, load up certain items and get going to the next location.


[24-Aug-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	basically give something pending orders on a certain condition that has to be setup every time.


[24-Aug-23 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	that way i can turn ships around even while im asleep


[24-Aug-23 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	this game could get away with a rudimentary coding interface to pre plan stuff like that..this game is that..kinda game


[24-Aug-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	but then you're not getting as much screen time ofc


[24-Aug-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	and this is a beautiful game


[24-Aug-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	saying that it will cause an unobtainable standard that customers will demand?


[24-Aug-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	bryh I had a friend that raved about the early access 2 years ago


[24-Aug-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	its crazy the standard is so..lol


[24-Aug-23 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	its all over the news now that devs are mad about the game releasing complete with no microtransactions


[24-Aug-23 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	mind blowing


[24-Aug-23 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	quality devs are fleeting.


[24-Aug-23 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	releasing a good game. I've considered getting it but think itd suck me in too much


[24-Aug-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	lol. if you get it and hate the control scheme, theres few mods that change the camera and controls to that of a 3rd person rpg


[24-Aug-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Was just talking about this with my brother earlier today...standards for the industry have shifted far enough that when a fully functional game gets released everyone praises it except the competing companies


[24-Aug-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	right


[24-Aug-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya. and that really sucks. i used to preorder games back in xbox and early xbox 360 days, not any more


[24-Aug-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Never know what you're going to get


[24-Aug-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i usually dont get a game till at least a week after release so i can see reviews


[24-Aug-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	And even if it's okay for todays standards, spending 70 bucks on a new game just doesn't feel right


[24-Aug-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	agreed, i play indies more than AAA games now


[24-Aug-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	AAA no long means AAA quality. its just big studio that is trying to get money


[24-Aug-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Just AAA pricing :p


[24-Aug-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya.


[24-Aug-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	game engine companies are loving the indie focused takeover tho. they getting alot more money and pushing their tech further faster


[24-Aug-23 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeeed


[24-Aug-23 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	so how do we fix the industry?


[24-Aug-23 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	saw an AI that can make 1/2 the next Frame before the info comes in to make it. shit predicts based on last few ones


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	there it is ai games


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Im in


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Jeeez


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	seen the AI anti cheat?


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	without seeing any files, it can tell when someone turns on cheats because their abilities instantly change


[24-Aug-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	no but that is scary to think about, I can imagine XD


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	ive always thought that'd be easyt to monitor anyway


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya, its going to be in the next few AAA titles, like COD and stuff.


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	usually theres a time variation which i'd think would be easy to net catch


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	its already been announced.


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm imaging someone letting their older brother play an FPS game only for them to get immediately kicked haha


[24-Aug-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i was also XD


[24-Aug-23 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	that ai can even tell when someone makes a new account because it stores their gameplay fingerprint


[24-Aug-23 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	time to go move to mexico


[24-Aug-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	this ai shit is rapidly advancing. but we still got a lawyer who lost his job and law certification because of chatgpt making stuff up


[24-Aug-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Crazy stuff people are going to be able to do with tech soon


[24-Aug-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DeniedClimax**:	just dont put on the headset lol


[24-Aug-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	im hoping we can get some restrictions put in. having artists and writers lose their jobs because of greedy companys using ai doesnt fly with me.


[24-Aug-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	heard about a game studio that under the table started training an ai with art that its current artists was making so they could fire them all


[24-Aug-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	We just give it all up and let ai take over every decision and job


[24-Aug-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	lol


[24-Aug-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Trying to restrict something like that after it gets as easily accessible and widespread at it can would be difficult


[24-Aug-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Maan, I wouldn't mind some ai digging holes for me in this heat


[24-Aug-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	remote controlled diggers, drills, and farming equipment exhist.


[24-Aug-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Jeez


[24-Aug-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	hell we got surgery happening from different countries with remote control bots


[24-Aug-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	0.55+0.35=0.6 that one is even stranger.


[24-Aug-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kuben**:	effective marketing on the LM @DaniedClimax ^_^


[24-Aug-23 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	wow, you found a game habit from before my time, though I had heard of it, the automated trading


[24-Aug-23 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so the story I got told happened back when there was no minimum difference in prices, even 1K objects could be bid in 0.01 increments, this became known as penny wars


[24-Aug-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so, while I was around before they limited it to 3 significant decimals, this behavior had stopped before then anyway, the story I was told was that a few people made basic scripts that checked their listed CX orders vs others, if they were best price, nothing happened, but if someone undercut them or bid higher, it cancelled their order and relisted it 0.01 better than the new one, but it wouldn't list the whole amount, because there is a limit to how often you can cancel a order on the CX for the same good each day (eg you can only cancel RAT on HRT 5 times per day, after that, wait a day before you cancel again), so what these bots did was list part of the order, if the other person cancelled and relisted the whole order, the bot would again list part of the order, until the person listing his whole order hit is limit of cancels per day, at which point the bot would list the remaining part of the order (and cancel what it could), meaning they had the best price on the CX by 0.01


[24-Aug-23 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	sorry for the wall of text... I should have formatted that better...


[24-Aug-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	anyway, the game was a lot smaller back then, people realized that it was making the game less fun for everyone (including the people with the bots), so stopped doing it, while later, the devs introduced the 3 significant decimals to further limit this practice


[24-Aug-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why if I'm going to beat a price on the CX to undercut or overbid someone, I do it by a notable more notable amount, as the memory was still fresh for others when I started and the behavior was somewhat looked down on


[24-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@worvard you can batch shipment jobs by seperating them with some rented warehousing, being separate from your base storage --- its just a little tedious, but it gives you a chance to double check what items you'll just be quickly flicking over to your ships when they get to a base.


[24-Aug-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	why have I never thought of doing that, shame I can't do that at the CX warehouse. I tend to use that one to store a lot of stuff I don't need right now.


[24-Aug-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	always a treat to get a history lesson from @bazdakka


[24-Aug-23 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**worvand**:	@bazdakka i was around whent hey implemented the 1% change minimum. that 1 cent change on multi thousand costing items caused the market to move very slowly. that stuff sucked


[24-Aug-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	:facepalm: Does anyone have 1 BTA on Avalon they are willing to sell? I posted a Local Market ad for market maker price


[24-Aug-23 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	thanks, @worvand


[24-Aug-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	np i keep alot on hand


[24-Aug-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I should learn to do the same :D


[24-Aug-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i have everything ill need for the next 30 days in inventory, including repairs, takes alot of STO to fit it all


[24-Aug-23 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i have 5 storage expansions built XD


[24-Aug-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	gee whiz, 25000 units?


[24-Aug-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	26.5k capacity. cant forget the CM capacity


[24-Aug-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	having alot of supplies means i can spend longer inbetween resupplies and stock up on price dips


[24-Aug-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	right. 3 permits?


[24-Aug-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	2 rn


[24-Aug-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i think. damn one second


[24-Aug-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya 3 but not full


[24-Aug-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	ah. At first I thought single permits where the way to go, but as I start to use up my shipping capacity, I see the wisdom of just making bigger bases


[24-Aug-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya single permits are more efficient, but put strain on your shipping.


[24-Aug-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	and my spreadsheeting


[24-Aug-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	lol


[24-Aug-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i built a ship that only does STL stuff in hortus


[24-Aug-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	really helps free up your other ships and is much cheaper to build


[24-Aug-23 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	good idea


[25-Aug-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	agreed, I'm thinking with the next base planned in system I might even add another glass STL ship in system, let me run slower burns between planets when it's quite


[25-Aug-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I just got into the habbit of keeping a bunch of every prefab I use to repair buildings on the planet, doesn't work very well at higher tiers, it's very expensive to set up


[25-Aug-23 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as to shipping, it's why some older players sometimes build shipyards in odd systems sometimes (says that planning to drop a shipyard in a few months when I can spare Afabs)


[25-Aug-23 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i wish i could do stl ship piggybacking on a FTL ship. would make getting them to their system of work easier


[25-Aug-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	specialty ships would be interesting, a ship that can tug another ship in ftl and stl for ship rescuing and moving, a asteroid clearing ship that reduces asteroid damage taken to ships where it travels,  orbital launch ships that resist launch and landing stresses better and can trade inventories in space but are slow in space.


[26-Aug-23 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	saw redfall? that shit was so fucked up it was really sad


[27-Aug-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	We sort of have those, but not really.... Ship Drone Repair Bays reduce incoming damage from all source, yet it doesn't "repair" the ship. Stability Systems prevent hard landings on risky planets. Larger fuel/cargo bays allow you to haul more fuel around for whatever purpose. All of those are only viable if you upgrade your STL engines, as they're detrimental towards max acceleration, and thus average travel time.


[27-Aug-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	no way of clearing asteroids, or trading in space, or hauling other ships, :/ i know the system is new, but ships are very generalized and the only specialization options are cargo bay type and not putting a FTL engine on.


[27-Aug-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	needs more pew-pew :D


[27-Aug-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	a shuttle would be cool maybe capable of bring small loads to planet so the whole ship doesn't need to land


[27-Aug-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	or maybe something like a long range scanner to make planetary exploration survey from orbit to make them actually useful


[28-Aug-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ouu shuttle, like something you can add to a ship so it can do inventory trades in orbit with the surface. and love the long range scanner, currently i just auto deny all planet exploration quests. would like a buff to that.


[28-Aug-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Ya me too once I found out that I had to land to complete them I never took another one


[28-Aug-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	suppling a material, or trade run to the station are just so much simplier and fit in with what im already doing so well


[28-Aug-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TcEnterprize**:	Ya I agree except the times it wants grapes and pays half there cost


[28-Aug-23 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Aug-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	:D indeed


[31-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	I have 16 FP and yes keeping them running will be a challenge till next week


[31-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	but then ill have enough capital to buy more products at a time


[31-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	sounds like fun!


[31-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I ended up building 3 Hydroponics farms here on Avalon to supplement Promitor produce


[31-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	farms take so much space


[31-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	but at least produce is light


[31-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	yep, HYF produces much more per area


[31-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	but requires NS to run


[31-Aug-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	HYF also ignores fertility


[31-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	oh thats true


[31-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	does it still get agri bonus?


[31-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	yes


[31-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	just not fertility bonus. but also runs where there is no fertility


[31-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DavikCo**:	thats nice then


[31-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	There should be a good supply of NS at the CX. Price has been dropping lately


[31-Aug-23 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	@ArcturusRex you just need more ships, or post more shipping ads :P


[01-Sep-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	or bigger ships and just hold more stock at each base so it doesn't run out


[01-Sep-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I just went with a couple of STOs and a glass STL only ship, it'll occassionally run out to Helion Prime, but most of it's time is spend running Promitor > Avalon > sometime HRT > Promitor


[01-Sep-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I fly it fairly fast most of the time, with a quick trip being Promitor > Avalon > Promitor taking 24 hours, a few of them, then as planets cycle away, stop at HRT so it's 36 hours as well dropping off the bulk of the RAT I make


[01-Sep-23 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I'm prom -> ava -> hrt rinse and repeat daily


[01-Sep-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@Roh Mostly should have built up a stockpile of RAT inputs before laying down all those FPs. Not waiting = having to send lots of little shipments (as ag is produced on Prom), rather than waiting for a few larger shipments


[01-Sep-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	But a few infusions from the CX helps


[01-Sep-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you can try Arc, however if you even try to go to a full permit expansion on FPs, you'll be stretching your two starter ships rather thin.


[01-Sep-23 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	i have 2k tonnage capacity available with a turnaround averaging of 2 days available for shipping jobs to my long term partners,  including myself, just for Hortus system. Naturally this could include all the other planets of interest, however Avalon is a very hungry monster.

**ArcturusRex**:	::roar::


[01-Sep-23 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	only reason I don't go to HRT every cycle is because sometimes I don't have a full cargo hold of stuff to deliver there, I only go to HRT when the cargo hold can be filled (or there is something I need to pick up at HRT urgently), otherwise I figure, it can wait here till I have enough for a full cargo hold, saves a trip and a small amount of fuel

[02-Sep-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	It'll be slow going to start.  Just get your orders queued up for now.


[09-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xxKobalxx**:	Okay so basically just queue some things up and check back in tomorrow?


[09-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Pretty much.


[09-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xxKobalxx**:	Sounds good to me, thank ya much!


[09-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It can get more involved the bigger you get.


[09-Oct-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	But it's pretty simple in the beginning.


[09-Oct-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xxKobalxx**:	That's kinda what I figured, I'd imagine this stuff starts to compound as it goes on


[09-Oct-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can keep things simpler if you make a point of it.


[09-Oct-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Some pretty old accounts just chill out on one planet.


[09-Oct-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Others have bases on thirty planets and must have turned all their hair grey by now.


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Having three bases is quite a challenge to keep everything running


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Well, my other 2 are basically self-sufficient, but Avalon requires me to ship in goods at least once a day


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Damn this high efficiency


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I have 171% efficiency on my 25 FPs


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xxKobalxx**:	See I'm not going to lie the constant flipping back and forth and fine tuning each piece is one of the aspects I'm most interested in!


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's neat, and it's pretty cool to see the effect of getting bonuses lined up.


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It can definitely become more and more of a hassle though.


[09-Oct-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Whats the ship upgrade offer


[09-Oct-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Uh.

[09-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah.


[09-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I need to buy pro again dont I?


[09-Oct-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, you need pro to build any ships, and you need pro to operate more than two ships at a time.


[09-Oct-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	That's lame, I should be able to use them all with BASIC


[09-Oct-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah.


[09-Oct-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can have them, but I think you can only have two in flight at a time without shelling out.


[09-Oct-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	(More seriously, the AVA LM filing fee is cheaper, and I figure it's seen by people who already have bases here, and therefore have inbound shipping)


[20-Oct-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	good point, but the 1 day shipping will turn off some people from the contract


[20-Oct-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	its making 340k a week.  Cost depends on people sneaking in to pay the COGCs and what not.  It would be pretty close to even I think if I was paying for everything every week.


[24-Oct-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Vile_Adventurer**:	lol, why the shipyard?


[24-Oct-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Holy cow, someone actually did it for Avalon


[24-Oct-23 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	seems like shipyards are in season this week. Boucher, Verdant, and now Avalon!


[24-Oct-23 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You better believe I'll use this one over VH-331e (sorry-ish)


[24-Oct-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Oh hey we have a shipyard now :o


[24-Oct-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	What's wrong with Shiptronia, @MysteriousWalrus?


[24-Oct-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	The shipyard on Boucher surprised me because it's in the "middle of nowhere." This one surprises me because this system already has a shipyard. Aren't they all created equal? It is the availability and flow of parts that strikes me as the key variable, and I have no insight beyond what shows up in the CX.


[24-Oct-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Shiptronia has bad environmental factors, which effect landing damage and various factors. Also renting the 2000 ICA warehouse is a slight pain if you do that


[24-Oct-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The starting shipyards are all on very bad planets with high warehouse fees


[24-Oct-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I'm curious as to why Avalon was favored over Promitor for the new shipyard, but definitely not complaining!


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm so glad that shipyard got built, because I was on my way to shiptronia when I got the notification


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	now I can abort that flight and take it home to avalon


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	that'll save a 2000 ICA warehouse bill


[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	It was just a cargo bay upgrade


[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	IT is*


[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	yeah but you have to empty out your fuel tanks somewhere, unless you bring an escort ship


[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Hello, world. I'm throwing my hat in for governorship of Avalon. While this would be my debut appearance in the governance sphere, I am committed to stability, transparency, and the furtherance of your goals on Avalon. I would be honored to receive your vote in this upcoming election.


[24-Oct-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	So far "will probably not set things on fire" is the only promise we've got to vote on


[24-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	"Vote Bob. Everything will probably be perfectly all right, maybe."


[24-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bodian**:	@ActurusRex Ref your curiousity.. It was attempted but Promitor didn't have any free plots. I had no idea these counted toward planetary projects.


[25-Oct-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I still wonder about he shipyard, by the time your buying anything for a ship upgrade, 2000 for a single rental of a warehouse is pocket change


[25-Oct-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but I'll take it, Avalon is better, but by no means is it better than the cost of actually building a shipyard in the first place


[25-Oct-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the shipyard at Shiptoria has done a total of 280 finished projects, if they all rented a warehouse for 1 week, that is 560,000 ICA in rental fees, I'm pretty sure the shipyard costs more than that, though I'm also aware that earlier on in the universe (before building FTL ship was unlocked or ship upgrades) a few corps did production with the, dropped off at shipyard of your choice as part of the deal and that would increase rental fees

**P-Money**:	If you vote me in as governor, I promise to use the money for the advancement of Food Industries on Avalon ( I have 28 Food Processors, and I'm sure many of you do too) as well as expanding the warehouse :)


[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I've been an upstanding base operator here for a while, I employ 1,120 pioneers, and I even started the first project at our wonderful shipyard :p


[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	26 FP plus a lonely FER


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	While the advancement of Food Industries on Avalon is consistent with HTNO's goals, and those of many of you on this world, I argue that to declare a focus on this sector at the expense of others is premature. I argue that we must not lose sight of the needs of other industries on this world. I have heard from companies on Avalon in the Chemicals industry, supporting HYFs and HER production on our nearby breadbasket Promitor, and would assert that it is essential to our shared prosperity that the governor of Avalon work towards the continued success of this sector among others.


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Additionally, the new gift of a shipyard on our world opens new and intriguing possibilities for our future that we must not ignore. The demand for ships, and upgrades to the same, is unrelenting and poorly served, and we as a world have a new opportunity to change this. It is imperative that the new governorship consider how this new resource may be supported for the benefit of all.


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	But while we open our ears to new possibilities, we must of course honor and support the needs of those who continue to rely on Avalon's unique combination of exchange proximity, habitability, proximity to fertile land, and continued support for our Food Industries sector as provided for by the Chamber of Global Commerce. From my perspective, supporting the needs of Avalon's constituents by keeping the Chamber running is the governorship's most important charge, and I pledge to apply the planetary revenue in service of this vital task.


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Above all else, I promise as leader to listen, to try to understand, and to use the powers of governorship to further your goals on this world.


[26-Oct-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If I happen to become governor, my main goal is just to make sure pioneers, settlers, and technicians have a relatively stable unemployment across the board. I'm not planning on changing any of the local rules of Avalon nor am I trying to do anything spectacular, I just plan on trying my best to make sure everyone can get enough lower tier workers for their needs.


[26-Oct-23 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	My main goal is to blow up, and then act like I don't know nobody hawhawhawhawhaw


[26-Oct-23 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	To be clear about what I plan to do if I win - to be transparent with you guys. I will let the first week (that I get taxes) ride to get an understanding of expenses vs. taxes. Depending on that I will post an update in this chat and make changes to the taxes if need be.


[26-Oct-23 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	sure I guess, but I'm more responding to the messages above about considering chem for avalon cogc. Surely the vast majority of people are doing food here and chem on helion already, what's the point in changing that?


[26-Oct-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	chem is already expensive enough to establish and profitable enough to run that the INS is kind of a rounding error


[26-Oct-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	oh my I didn't notice that. Gonna have to vote for the Food Processing!


[26-Oct-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Oct-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Brushing aside the referenced opponent's contempt -- for they are an opponent in this election, and they do show contempt -- I'll instead address what I see as the heart of their question: How would I possibly address the needs of voters so differently aligned?


[27-Oct-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	It's quite simple. The Chamber of Global Commerce provides for the needs of its constituents as long as it is fed, and a healthy worker pool provides for the collective good of all so long as it is sustained by the planetary infrastructure.


[27-Oct-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	As a fellow landholder with a vested interest in these, it is impossible for my goals to be misaligned with yours, as both are supported by these in service of a singular mission: "Keep calm and make money."

**worvand**:	In a attempt to be flowery with your language, you introduced 2 falsehoods, it is possible for your goals to be "misaligned" with mine, you just got to be in a different field and want different COGC buffs or be a tyrant govenor who majorly increases or maxes out taxs for no reason, and the other is, the COGC doesn not provide for "needs" it provides a buff that people would like, but their bases can run without them. Your attempts at diplomatic speech just sound like a cult speech to me :/

[28-Oct-23 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I keep it simple, I'm running a base that's nearly maxed (4 area left) with FPs. I understand that this planet produces a surplus of taxes. My plans are to make this planet even better for FP operators like myself and the many others, by lowering taxes on FP outputs such as RAT, DW, COF. I also want to use the surplus money to expand the warehouse as much as possible (I think the limit is 1000 units but maybe not)


[28-Oct-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm also active 7 days a week and I've never failed to deliver a contract on time yet. I think I'm a trustworthy candidate and if elected governor, any Avalon site owner can expect me to respond to their concerns in under 24 hours (assuming no personal, real life, emergencies)


[28-Oct-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if surplus money was a thing then that would be a decent idea, but most planets run at a deficit and require the governor to put in their own money sadly. while you do seem more "sane" than survivorbob, having someone who already been a govenor on the list puts you at a major disadvantage, there are many intricacies to being govenor, like being in your own corp so money isnt sent to other members or corp, setting corp as reciever of taxes, and running a spreadsheet to keep track


[29-Oct-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Avalon does not run at a deficit according to the current gov


[29-Oct-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Garrosh**:	I don't want to be rude or anything, but I think it's going to happen somewhere else


[29-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I don't know if I'd consider this a 'very profitable job.' Esabab made it sound like it was just about breaking even


[29-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	lol no being gov is usually not profitable at all


[29-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xflqr_**:	yup :)


[29-Oct-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if you want to be governor, start on a smaller planet and learn the ins and outs as theirs not really a definitive guide on it.


[29-Oct-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I can tell you that Boucher is fairly break even, at the moment we're upgrading infastructure so I'm actually spend more than I get in taxes. I post the financial summary every week and if you are on the faction operations discord you'll find the gsheets link in the Boucher politics channel.


[29-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Esabab said Avalon makes 300k profit per week, wym "just about breaking even"?


[29-Oct-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I would decrease the taxes a bit, so it might be close to even if I had my way


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	10/24 09:10 AM [CUGB] MysteriousWalrus Out of curiosity, what's the weekly cost vs. taxes?


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	10/24 09:12 AM [XX] Esabab its making 340k a week. Cost depends on people sneaking in to pay the COGCs and what not. It would be pretty close to even I think if I was paying for everything every week.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	"It would be pretty close to even I think if I was paying for everything every week." Is not 300k in profit, it's taxes going to POPI


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	thats a vague answer, like if he's not paying for everything, what is not getting paid for? It sounds like they are collecting the 340k and doing nothing


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm sure that's not the case, but it comes off that way


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	to me at least


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Paying for everything every week - you can buy the stuff bulk at the beginning of the month


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Making your own goods, there's different ways that could make sense


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	lol pmoney calm down


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	When I was governing Circa, I bought a decent amount of the stuff in bulk but some of the other stuff bought almost weekly.


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But I doubt they're making 300k in profit looking at the current taxes...


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	governors barely make money


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	it just doesnt work that way sadly


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	popi is expensive


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	especially with these taxes being set to the lowest already


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	cant even lower the taxes below 10 in faction space I think


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Correct


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	prices vary indeed though, because sometimes people like to be generous and fill needs of the popi


[29-Oct-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	like I did with DW, I supplied all of it for quite a while until I stopped making it


[29-Oct-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	pop upkeep, cocg bills, gov programs. It all adds up! plus any upgrades needed to maintain population happiness.


[29-Oct-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	many people new to governorship seem to get the idea that its easy money, but sadly its alot of work and expense management.


[29-Oct-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	back when i started it was normal for governors to lose a few hundred K a term just keeping everything afloat. glad people arnt afraid of slightly higher taxes now.


[29-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	anyone know how much govt programs cost currently? all the other costs seem easy to manage.


[29-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'd assume ~50k for festivities III?


[29-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Not bad for what it does


[29-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	PF scales with the population. PF1 on Prim costs about as much as PF3 on Boucher


[29-Oct-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Interesting, thanks for that context!


[29-Oct-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Oops, I meant Prom not Prim


[30-Oct-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	someone should name a close by planet primitor just to cause lots of confusion XD


[30-Oct-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	circa and circe all over again


[30-Oct-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Promotor


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Given that most people would probably just type "Prom" when keying in destinations, the maximum damage would be done by naming it Promator


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Assuming the auto-complete goes alphabetically


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Oooh


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep, just confirmed that using Circa and Circe


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	"Prometor" works too


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Does it go by planet named alphabet or system - searching "No" in the PLI - Nova Honshu, Nova Unalaska, Nobellion


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I don't think it allows searching by system, e.g. Midway c


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Or Bastion for that matter


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah...the newish named systems can't all be search currently


[30-Oct-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But what I meant is that it looks like it may alphabetize by system designation


[30-Oct-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Coming close to the end of my current term - Avalon is running at a 125000 ICA deficit per week keeping the planet supplied with the inputs required to maintain the population. If I get re-elected I am going to raise taxes by a small bit for Pioneers and Settlers, each a week apart to see how much each effect the total financial situation.

[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@MysteriousWalrus interesting point! If you raised them both together, you wouldn't know how much each contributed to tax revenue. I imagine PIO represents the lion's share, due to FP being PIO-only


[26-Nov-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'd assume having +5x as many PIOs they should be doing the lion's share of taxes, it'll be nice to see how big of a difference that small raise will make

[27-Nov-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Mordgier, Governor of Circa (QQ-001a) is trying to encourage new bases on the Circa, he is offering discounted tier 1 prefabs and 90d payment periods for said materials - If you're interested to do some manufacturing in the Moria region or interested in the planets resources, let him know I told you to reach out to him and see what deals you can work out! :]


[27-Nov-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Not entirely the best location to advertise this, but it's a nice foothold in that region if you want to expand out of Hortus


[27-Nov-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Pricing reference if you want to settle on Circa: "BSE:1K BBH:1.5k BDE:1.5k BTA:800 MCG:20"


[27-Nov-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Well that's going to accelerate my plans to colonize Circa


[27-Nov-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just putting it on the table, there are closer manu planets, e.g. Nova Honshu and one of the OF-443 planets


[27-Nov-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	^


[27-Nov-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	OF-443B


[28-Nov-23 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Avalon is a great first expansion for Promitor starts though


[14-Dec-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Yeah its fantastic. Eats an unholy amount of water until I get boucher up and running tho lol


[14-Dec-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	just try to keep those FPs running 24/7, it can be tough


[14-Dec-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	very true. even with boucher, promitor, and Chu I still dry up my materials at times


[14-Dec-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I haven't run out on Avalon yet, but I've exhausted my backlog of crops from before I reached this level of consumption, so it's increasingly a risk.

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Avalon can output a whoooole lot


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	ill eventually turn promitor into RIGs instead of farms


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Some would consider that heresy, I'd be a hypocrite if I judged you :p


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	yea, too much for me lmao i gotta run with no luxury consumables


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	1000/1000 area :o


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	can i ask, when did you start spending the permits for the extra area?


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I put down my base on Avalon at 60d in, which was after I fully developed Promitor


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I added permits to Promitor when I needed more space to build


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	woa


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i wasnt planning on adding extra permits to any bases until new ones starting making half of the best base i have


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The only base I have extra permits on right now is Promitor, as it hurts to me to have it underdeveloped


[17-Dec-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i was planning on developing boucher first, but the advantage of all those FRMs is pretty big


[17-Dec-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Really hard choice there :p


[17-Dec-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jan-24 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Darth_Merkel**:	how do you get 4 Permits, isnt 3 the limit?


[15-Jan-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	Upgrading your HQ gives you more permits


[15-Jan-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Three permits is the limit per planet, but you can have more than one base.


[15-Jan-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	There's a limit at some point for free accounts, but I don't remember what it is off hand.


[15-Jan-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	As @SurvivorBob said, you get more permits by upgrading your HQ, which becomes increasingly expensive.


[15-Jan-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	The limit for a free account is eith 5 or 6 permits. I wanna say it was 6


[15-Jan-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Dzentak, it's worth noting you can't put Corp HQs on any original starter planet - Promitor, Avalon, Montem, and Vallis to name a few


[15-Jan-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	well i dont need to fully build out promitor then at 3 permits, i can do some other things besides frm at least for myself


[15-Jan-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I only put 1 permit on each of my planets


[15-Jan-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I usually try to only put 1 permit per planet, but I can easily justify three on Promitor, and more than one on Boucher

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Almost all expenses between December 17 and January 18 seem to be covered by the tax dividends received within those times - past month only running ~75k in the red. I've been logging expenses and revenues since taking up governorship but haven't made it public. If enough people are interested I could try and throw together ~monthly reports, though they'll be ugly and somewhat inaccurate at representing the situation entirely


[18-Jan-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It might be interesting to see for curiosity's sake, but I trust your governance.


[18-Jan-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Only problem with logging it as such is that I don't really buy/bring supplies in every week or something to correspond with taxes and such, I just buy/stock up on them randomly when needed, like monthly sometimes then weekly sometimes


[18-Jan-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll play around with formats and stuff to see if I can log the upcoming month in a favorable way :o


[18-Jan-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Alright! I played around with formats for a while and settled with this - The following shows a (hopefully) really accurate summary of the past month of Avalon's expenses and revenues. If this is something you guys would like me to continue feel free to ask and I'll try to make monthly ones :]

[18-Jan-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	As long as the embezzlement is for the nuking of Promitor or the consumption of PIOs or SETs in INCs then it's not embezzlement, it's a line item (:

**Roh**:	I mean those parcels are fairly obvious, regarding what they could be carrying.


[03-Feb-24 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Obvious to the extent that they're some sort of electronics commodity, from a CLR, EDM, or ELP. They're unlikely to be an intermediary product, and more likely to be an end-use thing like CDs or MHPs (to be used in POPI upkeep), since there's no utility in sending electronics intermediaries, of such little size, across the galaxy, since bases that make them will be integrated for production requirements.


[03-Feb-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Since the shipping tallies only provide 2 decimal places beyond the whole number, and since it's so small, I can't determine what's exactly in there, only a really good guess, since nothing else fits the parameters :P


[03-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So, not the plutonium but just the triggering mechanisms?


[03-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	or maybe some recently filled porn that's been burned to a CD, and it needs to hit the universe-wide broadcasting network, really fast?


[03-Feb-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Likely not SWF or MWF. It could be a RAD (i didnt know they were so tiny). RADs are used for BRS production for STL ships, so it's very likely that.


[03-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The other high likelihood is just a handful of PDAs or SCNs (high tier pop consumables)


[03-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, you can get fairly accurate intelligence from what's available in this game. Public shipping ads can be correlated with commodity properties to give highly probable estimates of cargo values, and I can grab all of your basic base information to figure which sort of probability is the highest.


[03-Feb-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I hear people complain of piracy, but i think most who do it are just dumb.


[03-Feb-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you had actual pirates in here, they would be sniping high value shipments with a high probability factor, and play it off as "shipping errors" as much as they could on the communication platforms, until they could cash out and transfer the loot to a a fund willing to launder the money.

**MysteriousWalrus**:	This latest finance report is being finished before I expected. Going forward I will try to post them on the first Sunday of a month, though I might engage in some tomfoolery here and there. Numbers look weird as, if you look in the transactions page, there was a giant donation and thus money was put towards improving Avalon's infrastructure. Next report will is expected on March 3rd, in which I expect less costs from population inputs, resulting in some money I can put towards warehousing or something else useful. Please let me know if you're interested in seeing these going forward! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vSyXHLe7fMgXp3v2_WMDFZY84N6xOj7J09fYmw8_iK-uxkXFMCaXBurQ-PQ8Dnfe3MP2dnYu0kkGFP4/pubhtml#

**P-Money**:	LCB just means large cargo bay. WCB stands for weight cargo bay (even though in-game it's called a High-Load Cargo Bay) because it prioritizes weight capacity over volume


[16-Feb-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I think there is also a VCB which does the opposite, prioritizing volume over weight

**MysteriousWalrus**:	This month's financial report seems a bit healthier, as expected due to less inputs being required overall for population infrastructure, I expect expenses to drop a little further during the next month as well. Look forward to hearing any feedback if there is any... I'll attach the report so you guys can look over it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTJnUilm8HsTQcPJxcJMm6KqYQL19M2vwVhK2AmTg0N5gG-jdtBsoG26fXJEcGVzOhDG_eiS4dETgD3/pubhtml#

[01-Mar-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Current plan is to invest it into infrastructure but that won't necessarily be a long term sink for it - I'll think of ways to use it that could benefit the planet further down the line :p


[01-Mar-24 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Way to pull off matching projections to real needs pretty close. I think extra infrastructure investment is good as well

**worvand**:	its good seeing it finally in the green without extra donations needed, that donations field has been propping it up in alot of the previous ones. Im also glad to see mysteriouswalrus actually getting rewarded for all the work, altho 14k a day still isnt much compared to what bases can pump out.


[01-Apr-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	@survivorbob how goes your planet that you govern?


[02-Apr-24 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@SurvivorBob, due to you blocking all dealings with my corporation, even a player that wasn't even 30d in at the time of joining, with seemingly no explanation, I do not owe you one here.


[02-Apr-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If there is anyone here that's actually interested in the surplus and has creative ways of me utilizing it, I am open to such suggestions. Though I will let it be known, I do believe that Governors in this game should be rewarded for doing what they do. I look forward to hearing any feedback from you guys :]


[02-Apr-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You should just keep it for yourself


[02-Apr-24 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Grand prize for Avalon bingo night.


[02-Apr-24 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	raise the taxes by 1% and skim it off the top :)


[02-Apr-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	maybe that nuke will \\finally\\ be built, do you know how long we've been waiting???? @mysteriouswalrus make. it. happen.


[02-Apr-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	pls no nuke


[02-Apr-24 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	where would we test the nuke? testing it on avalon or promitor would be a bad idea. we need a lifeless planet that has no value.


[02-Apr-24 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Hortus J.  Close enough to make the point.


[02-Apr-24 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	naa we cant nuke right next to us, we got to pull a ww2, develop and test in secret then lets the first use make the statement


[02-Apr-24 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You, uh, are aware of where they conducted those nuclear tests, right?


[02-Apr-24 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Namely inside the contiguous United States.


[02-Apr-24 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	and on some islands


[02-Apr-24 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i propose life- the planet for testing that is


[02-Apr-24 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	ZV-896c


[02-Apr-24 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	out of the way, unlikely to impact us in any meaningfull way, and it'll teach those hippies whats what


[02-Apr-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	@MysteriousWalrus Disappointing sentiment to hear from the Government of Avalon. 👎


[02-Apr-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	Yes, I am also very curious how the governor will utilize my 478.05 ICA/wk. /s


[02-Apr-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	@MysteriousWalrus Keep lining your pockets and keep up the good work :D


[02-Apr-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	705.88 ICA/wk*


[02-Apr-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@SurvivorBob if you believe that sentiment (that apparently a good few other site owners agree with) is disappointing, you are more then welcome to vote me out next election :]


[02-Apr-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	To everyone else that has responded to me, I really do enjoy governing you guys, I'll continue doing my best to keep the population stable !


[02-Apr-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	interesting drama between you two... as for govenorship, i doubt anyone misses what is essentially nickles and dimes in the videogame pocket from some taxes


[02-Apr-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	and its a nice bonus to deal with all the... complexity of actually governing a plant, esp one so large as avalon


[02-Apr-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Few people actually have any idea what goes into giving a shit about running a planet. Rule with an iron fist. Should raise taxes further, lean on the weak.


[02-Apr-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Jk, don't change, ur perfect


[02-Apr-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I don't see any problem with governors expecting to make a profit when they do a good job managing a planet and I would be disinterested in a game culture that would expect such a thing


[02-Apr-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I'm also in favor of Walrus just keeping the money, if the planet doesn't need more POPI.


[02-Apr-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I'm in favor of surpluses being disbursed to me.


[02-Apr-24 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	yeah as long as taxes are relatively reasonable you can just keep the surplus to yourself, congrats for even making a profit on that, not easy to do


[02-Apr-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NotPeaK**:	I vote we give it to FileFolders as well I think he has big plans


[02-Apr-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think that given that fact that most political seats irl offer monetary compensation for their services, eventhough it's fixed value, I see no problem in one pocketing in some surplus in a video game - the amount that varies even adds some meritocratic aspect to it. With all that being said, go Walrus, go!


[02-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	I just put down 8 pio houses and 20 fps to relize I didn't bring anything to produce..aaand demolished everything at the 7 minute mark. that was close :P


[02-Apr-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	To be clear, my disappointment is not with the Government of Avalon electing to assign its surplus to the benefit of its electted leader. That is a valid policy decision, and worthy of support.


[02-Apr-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SurvivorBob**:	If the leader chooses to use the platform of the Government to amplify an unrelated trade dispute in response to an inquiry from a landholder, then I have nothing to say to them.


[02-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	Francis Underwood would have you not say anything too, albeit with a different approach, if I had to guess


[02-Apr-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	so I'd consider myself lucky in your position, it could be worse :D


[02-Apr-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	"unrelated trade dispute" someone seems to have forgotten why you started this? yall ran for governor spouting stupid shit and saying yall would make bank on being governor by raising taxes constantly IN THIS VERY CHAT, i pointed out the stupidity and everyone thought you were just running as a gag like many people in the game do. after yall lost the running i noticed i could no longer run cargo for yall as i was blocked. REALLY? all this over losing an election yall werent taking seriously? thats straight up petty man.


[02-Apr-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	the fact that yall keep bringing up shit and then trying to play it off like we are the ones who started it really pisses me off.


[02-Apr-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	trust me, if we start shooting back you wont like it.


[02-Apr-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	who said we would make bank off of avalon? It was the exact opposite. When me and bob ran for governor both of us were adamant about NOT raising taxes, while someone else liked to increase them weekly in order to "break even" even though it was already profitable


[02-Apr-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you've got the wrong guy pal


[02-Apr-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	It's my opinion (not the culture of the game or whatever) that people shouldn't enrich themselves by taking advantage of government positions. I find it immoral in real life, but this is a game. If you want to increase taxes all the time, you certainly can, but I won't vote for ya. I likeit when politicians lower my taxes.


[02-Apr-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	bob was the one talking about raising taxes, you pmoney were talking about entising people to join the planet and change the COGC to something other than food industries, thats when i pointed out doing that on a planet already populated with lots of food industry was a bad idea and wouldnt get you votes


[02-Apr-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Why would I change the CoGC when I have 28 food processors here? You're just wrong man.


[02-Apr-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	thats why everyone assumed yall were running as a gag, yall kept spouting nonsence.


[02-Apr-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	this is a community game, stop treating it like pvp and get over the loss


[02-Apr-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	yeah no. What happened was Walrus had experience running a planet in the past and both of us were never governors, so somebody else in chat was saying "give it to the guy with experience, being a governor is so harrrd like you dont even understand"


[02-Apr-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	even though it's the easiest most basic thing ever to just let the planet with good programs stay the same


[02-Apr-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so now you block new players that associate with us over a difference in experience that SOMEONE ELSE SAID. do what you want with me, BUT KEEP NEW PLAYERS OUT OF THIS


[02-Apr-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I never ran for governor here on Avalon aprat from that one occasion. and since then my taxes have been increased like 2, 3, or maybe 4 times?


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	my block list is 2 people buddy


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	idc if you block me or what ever. DO NOT PUNISH OTHER OR NEW PLAYERS FOR IT


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	and none of them are in your corp


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	talk to survivor bob,


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you defending him, have him tell you what he has done


[02-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	bob is allowed to block whoever he wants. We may be in the same corp but I'm not his daddy


[02-Apr-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	then dont defend him


[02-Apr-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you arnt his daddy


[02-Apr-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm just clearing the record because people are saying stuff as a fact when it's actually the exact opposite of how it played out lol


[02-Apr-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	regardless, neither of us want this silly planet anyway now lol


[02-Apr-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	seems like ya do, tho, you still here


[02-Apr-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I want my food processors, yeah, but I don't need to collect taxes


[02-Apr-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so here is my offer, like i said before multiple times to even bob, drop it, its in the past. stop bringing that shit up


[02-Apr-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Like I said the originally, I only planned to be a one term governor and fix the tax situation so new players can make some money here. We got our own planets to worry about


[02-Apr-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	buddy, that was walrus campaign, yall were on meme shit


[02-Apr-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	You don't know what you're talking about, delusional


[02-Apr-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	We ran honest campaigns and walrus is the one who got elected and raised the taxes


[02-Apr-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	All I ask is that you don't spread lies about my corporation


[02-Apr-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	bruh you just said you would "fix the tax situation" now you blaming walrus for raising taxes, on your previous statement you would have also. avalon was in the red


[02-Apr-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	What do you think I meant??? I'm talking about lower taxes, not raising them!


[02-Apr-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	avalon wasn't in the red, most of the work here was done not by the governor but by other people donating to keep things running and upgrading


[02-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	He didn't have to raise taxes, and I wouldn't have either, even if it lowered my own profits


[02-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	but taxes are such a small part of operating costs that nobody pays attention


[02-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	naa not when survivor was talking about making bank from taxes in this chat. no one would take you seriously


[02-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you keep saying that but you're wrong


[02-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	that's not what happened


[02-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	that's not what we stand for


[02-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	wanna see who makes bank from taxes? lets compared corp dividends


[02-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I bet you benefit greatly from Walrus' tax increases


[02-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	that's why you're defending it and telling lies


[02-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	lol


[02-Apr-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	actually you don't get anything, he keeps it all for himself and left your corp so that you won't receive a dividend haha


[02-Apr-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	dude THATS HOW GOVENORS DO THINGS.


[02-Apr-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	look around every governor is in their own corp


[02-Apr-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	it fixes a problem with the game the devs are already working on fixing by overhauling the goverment system


[02-Apr-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	some people do that, I don't


[02-Apr-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	It's convenient to do that when you actually stand to make money from the position, it makes no sense to do it if you're in the red


[02-Apr-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	and thats why you didnt win the goverment, it is increadibly hard to track money income and outflow unless you do that


[02-Apr-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	it's actually easier to track income when everyone in the corp gets the same income instead of one person hoarding it all and having the ability to hide the true dividends from the rest of us


[02-Apr-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	but then you have to track everyone in the corp suppling stuff and how much expenses they are spending.


[02-Apr-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	and uh oh you have a bad egg. guess what you cant kick them from the corp.


[02-Apr-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	because there is no kick function


[02-Apr-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so now you have a leach


[02-Apr-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	funny thing is, if you're not trying to enrich yourself from the position and you operate the government altruistically then those bad eggs don't get a dividend


[02-Apr-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	what are you on about?


[02-Apr-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	making no sense


[02-Apr-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	If there's profit, it gets shared. If you're breaking even and not ripping people off, you don't get a profit from holding the gov


[02-Apr-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	your dividend will say 0


[02-Apr-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so everyone in the corp gets a cut of what the corp makes, you dont pick who gets it and who doesnt


[02-Apr-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you can pick who you invite to your corp. But everyone in the corp receives an exactly equal share of the taxes which becomes your dividend


[02-Apr-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you cant kick people or control who gets what, hence the making their own corp


[02-Apr-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	forcing your other corp mates to donate or send money around just because you want to be governor is a very sad outlook


[02-Apr-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Nobody in my corp is forced to donate to anything. Everyone in our corp joined for free with no expectations of ever having to donate to any projects. The people who cared about improving the planet did so out of their own pockets, not from robbing people


[02-Apr-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I fulfil COGCs all over the game universe and I'm not a governor of any planet. I'm giving up money to help these planets move forward


[02-Apr-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so now you are saying walrus robs people, especially after people back walrus over survivor bob?


[02-Apr-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Taxation is theft, don't you understand?


[02-Apr-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	especially if you jack up the taxes all the time


[02-Apr-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	taxation is payment to keep the population from leaving the planet without that person having to worry about said population


[02-Apr-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	walrus keeps population happy and manages growth vs new bases and you expect him to cover all costs of people who dont want to deal with that side of the planet himself


[02-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I didn't say any of that, here you go again


[02-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i much prefer paying taxes over having to keep importing materials and having fights over who puts in what


[02-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you did, by saying taxes arnt needed, you called it theft


[02-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	taxes are theft if the govenor does not provide a service


[02-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I didn't say I expect him to pay for it all now did I


[02-Apr-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	this govenor is DOING HIS JOB so go to hell calling it theft.


[02-Apr-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	then where would the items and money come from?


[02-Apr-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if no one covers it then we all lose workers


[02-Apr-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if it isnt the govenor its another person having to pay more than their share


[02-Apr-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	taxes is a way to make sure EVERYONE pays their share of keeping the workforce


[02-Apr-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	mmmmkay buddy


[02-Apr-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Everyone must be forced to pay into this system, it cannot be voluntary right? It's not like anybody can just donate supplies to the infrastructure. Except that they can do that any time


[02-Apr-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I don't donate to the infrastructure here anymore because of the greed. Walrus can afford to do it himself with the taxes that I'm giving him


[02-Apr-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	everyone is using the workforce that costs to upkeep, granted i would love a system that let you do donations instead of taxes but that system is 1 not in the game and 2 would be increadibly hard to prevent people taking advantage of


[02-Apr-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	like I said, I'm not a governor and I actually donate to planets out of my own profits in order to benefit newer players with less money


[02-Apr-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	so it is in the game, and you're telling lies again


[02-Apr-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if everyone had that outlook P-money, then we would be good, but we have MANY people not like that


[02-Apr-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	there is no way to do donations and have it give you a tax credit. p-money come one man


[02-Apr-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	yeah I can think of at least one of them


[02-Apr-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	tax credit? what?


[02-Apr-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you just said there was a way of tracking donations and making it fair for everyone, lets hear it


[02-Apr-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I just said what now? Read it again


[02-Apr-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i did a few times.


[02-Apr-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	"yeah I can think of at least one of them" in responce to my tax speal with 1 and 2


[02-Apr-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	so what system in the game insures everyone is paying their part for their workforce


[02-Apr-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	when I said "I can think of at least one of them" I'm talking about when you said "if everyone had that outlook P-money, then we would be good, but we have MANY people not like that"


[02-Apr-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i know there are people who do that, that is why i said MANY not ALL


[02-Apr-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	but regardless, everybody can see who donates to COGC or planet projects. Just scroll down and it says who donated what


[02-Apr-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	hell i used to give alot to popi, on avalon and prom both, even built a level on the warehouse just to boost us on how many warehouses we can have


[02-Apr-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya everyone can see who donates p-money, now how would you make someone who isnt donating, donate


[02-Apr-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	what system besides taxes forces someone to do their part when they arnt?


[02-Apr-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	why do people have to donate? Isn't it enough that I bring jobs to the planet and supply my own workforce with resources?


[02-Apr-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	why should new players who barely get by with 5 figure weekly profit be forced to pay into something that is only benefitting one individual (governor) in the end?


[02-Apr-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	but people who dont do their part in popi happiness and just use workforce cause popi to leave from unhappyness and take workforce from other bases


[02-Apr-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@P-Money, you have always said that being a governor is profitable, that hasn't been true for this planet until I raised the taxes AND then utilized this taxes and donations to upgrade the infrastructure for this planet to make it break even, and now more.


[02-Apr-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	worvand I don't think you know how population happiness works


[02-Apr-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Esabab, the previous governor, before stepping down told us all that taxes were 350k/wk and that it was only break even because he was supplying inputs from his own production


[02-Apr-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	anybody can donate to upkeep of infrastructure that increases the happiness


[02-Apr-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	im actually pretty aware on how happiness works


[02-Apr-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	SurvivorBob, ran on one of his promises of making a separate corporation to better track his tax dividends, then here you are saying that I am greedy and corrupt for doing that exact thing


[02-Apr-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	well happiness of pioneers comes from job availability, but you're saying that people who use our workforce are lowering the happiness


[02-Apr-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	But where are my benefits? dental, health, vision?? how am I supposed to take care of my workers :(


[02-Apr-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I didn't say you're greedy and corrupt for that, you're greedy for forcing us to pay higher and higher taxes when originally most of the work around here was being done by donations


[02-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	happiness comes from more than job availablility


[02-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	yeah theres also infrastructure which again is not the governors sole responsibility


[02-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Most of the work was not done by donations, it was done by Esabab and DiggingLake paying out of their own pockets.


[02-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I've actually been governor before and seen how it works


[02-Apr-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	oh so like donations


[02-Apr-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	"It's not donations, it's people voluntarily giving up their money" yeah that's what a donation is


[02-Apr-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	When it's the governor donating, it's just them doing their job.


[02-Apr-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Whether they raise taxes to fund the planet, or pull it out of their pockets, they are doing their job.


[02-Apr-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I also never "forced" anyone to pay higher taxes, I explicitly ran on the campaign of raising taxes.


[02-Apr-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	yeah the governor before was a chill guy who was charitable and not greedy


[02-Apr-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	not everyone voted for you, the rest of us are forced into your tax increases


[02-Apr-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	dude thats democracy, thats how voting works


[02-Apr-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	duh


[02-Apr-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You're acting like I'm milking you dry, I literally brought it in line with what other planets have


[02-Apr-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	the point flew over your head


[02-Apr-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm going to leave it at that, anybody can go back and read what I've said. I'm hungry and I've been too busy responding to you instead of eating my food. Let the people decide who is right, obviously I won't change your mind worvand


[02-Apr-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	however, anybody that wants a planet for growing crops with no taxes and a charitable corporation who keeps it going without asking for anything in return, you're welcome to build your base on Chu


[02-Apr-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's what I've been doing, just letting the people decide who is right. At least now if I get voted out of my position, my successor will actually be able to run the planet with the taxes they recieve from the office.


[02-Apr-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm not even mad at you walrus


[02-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I never said that :p


[02-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm only mad that worvand is out here spreading lies about my corp members


[02-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I was simply commenting on some discrepancies I saw throughout this conversation


[02-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Fair enough


[02-Apr-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	we may disagree on how to run a planet, but I'm not going to come running to take your position anytime soon. I have no desire for it anymore


[02-Apr-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	If someone promises to lower my taxes though, i'm sorry but they will have my vote


[02-Apr-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	I'll promise it and double them, don't say that.


[02-Apr-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	well then you'll have an angry constituency 🤣


[02-Apr-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	i can't blame anyone for wanting to make a profit in a capitalism simulator, but I prefer when I keep my money and give it out voluntarily


[02-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	taxation is not theft lol


[02-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	this is a german game and german ordoliberal economics is perfectly appropriate


[02-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	this whole dispute is stupid


[02-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	well what happens in real life when you don't pay your taxes? someone with guns comes to make you pay. that's basically robbery


[02-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	government officials IRL is paid


[02-Apr-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	yeah lol the government has a monopoly on violence and uses it to enforce its decrees, if you want to get neoreactionary about it, "no voice all exit" -- just move


[02-Apr-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	wait you can't because every functioning country disagrees with wingnut economics


[02-Apr-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Thinking that taxes are voluntary is delusional though


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	your money has value because the government insists that trade and tax collection be denominated in a currency controlled by its institutions


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	who said they were voluntary? they'll imprison you for not paying them


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	so then how is that not theft


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	because they have a legitimate right to collect economic revenue from a population that they manage and every nation that disagrees collapses because the new dynamics suck


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	governments whose primary revenue source is taxation or trade duties etc have a direct interest in the economy


[02-Apr-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	It's a necessary evil, but lets not pretend it isnt still stealing from someone else's labor


[02-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	alternative systems fall to the resource curse and other issues


[02-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	the whole concept of calling it theft is a misunderstanding in terms and a failure to understand political economy


[02-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	it's lolbert nonsense


[02-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	the government will also imprison you if you drive without a license


[02-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	or smoke in a restaurant


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	the monopoly on violence allows them to enforce the rules on people who operate in their territory


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	So if someone comes up with a gun in your face and says "give me half of what's in your wallet right now" you won't say you've been robbed. you'll say you voluntarily gave up your money


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	it's not theft because theft is illegitimate enrichment


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	that's just taxes


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I'm not arguing with college freshmen misunderstandings


[02-Apr-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	stop reading mises or whatever


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	theft is when people take things that they didn't earn


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	politics is an empirical discipline and at some point you people need to accept that your worldview is empirically unjustified


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I earn my money and the governement steals it from me


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	end of story


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	and that western liberal democratic capitalism is the clear victor regardless of how you feel about its "necessary evils"


[02-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	what is necessary is not evil


[02-Apr-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	this is pure sophistry


[02-Apr-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	this is not a genuine debate about the functioning of society, it is word-wrangling in search of an argument


[02-Apr-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	the Cosmocene Combine will gladly join the Citrus Union in your blacklist


[02-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you'll blacklist me because we have a philosophical disagreement lmao


[02-Apr-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	also, GLXY doesn't blacklist people if that's what you think is going on


[02-Apr-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	worvand must've gotten in your head


[02-Apr-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	if you say so


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I've never spoken to worvand


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	but you are repeating his talking points


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	but I can read this discussion and the two of you are making fools of yourselves by arguing for ideological positions which don't work


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	XD ok buddy


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	his "talking points" are mainstream understanding of economics and political economy and they have been empirically proven correct both in real life and in simplified models like PrUn


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	reconstruction of society and its policies from first principles is a laughably stupid error that always results in genocide or at best unintentional mass death


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	believing in this imaginary blacklist is "mainstream understanding of economics and political economy" to you?


[02-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	history is an empirical discipline


[02-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	can members of CU accept LM contracts from the relevant parties or no? did they do anything beyond humiliate the two of you to earn this?


[02-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	no further discussion is necessary


[02-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you can accept any of my LM contracts. Once again, nobody is blacklisted


[02-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I will not blacklist or mute anyone


[02-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I've blocked 2 people and that was for my own reasons, not because we decided as a corp to block them from intereacting with all of us


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	because I see all interaction as contractual under the implied terms of known-effective systematic approaches to governance


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	those implied terms do not require your consent


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	and none of those people are in your corp or in CU so whats the issue?


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	you are subject to the forces of hstory


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	the issue is that I'm abrasive and argumentative and I can't avoid an argument when I know I'm right


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you've lost the plot


[02-Apr-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	but I've said my piece and I will go do something else now


[02-Apr-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I will vote for Walrus as governor of Avalon for as many terms as he wishes to run


[02-Apr-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I advise everyone reading this to do the same no matter their feelings


[02-Apr-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	pure self-interest is sufficient. pay your taxes.


[02-Apr-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	if the government said your taxes were 100% I think you would feel differently


[02-Apr-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	laughable counter argument: if chocolate tasted like dog poop you wouldn't want to eat it


[02-Apr-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	but feel free to accept my contracts because none of you are blacklisted :)


[02-Apr-24 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	you can test it yourself instead of falling for what worvand told you


[02-Apr-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	so, who's next in line to feed the troll?


[02-Apr-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Ill pass this time @marchioro, but thank you for your generous offer :)


[02-Apr-24 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	@Marchioro Just throw him some taxes, he'll be quite happy


[02-Apr-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	@P-Money Are you serious?


[02-Apr-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Do you really think we're "enriching" ourselves off of 14K/day in tax revenue? Give me a break.


[02-Apr-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I love how you say Avalon was in the green before Walrus was governor and then admit that it relied on donations. Taxes in this game as they exist are so low you almost don't notice them. Avalon alone makes me enough in one day to cover what I pay in taxes across my whole company for a month.


[02-Apr-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	Just for some clarification, wouldn't it be 1,508.88/day if it were evenly split among CU's shareholders?


[02-Apr-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And your whole corp may not have blocked us as you say, but SurvivorBob has every single one of us blocked including a new player that wasn't even here for the last election.


[02-Apr-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	@Dayzed Correct!


[02-Apr-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yeah, we're all just getting fat and happy off of it! I've put at least 2.5 million ICA of my own money into upgrading the infrastructure on Avalon, but that's definitely what I'm after!


[02-Apr-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	The single-user corp system is a stand-in for the future system in which tax income will go to a special planetary fund.


[02-Apr-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	I feel like that's a fair wage to pay our Governor and the community members that prop up our economical upkeep. It's essentially pennies


[02-Apr-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	The reliance on donations by users to maintain planetary infrastructure is fine, I guess, but the governor is the one responsible if this system collapses. It's simply more rational to centralize maintenance responsibilities. Relying on private investment to solve collective action problems causes robber barons.


[02-Apr-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	"We maintain population infrastructure and maintain demographics on a planet as a charity" means that all of your politicians will be status-seekers rather than economically rational actors.


[02-Apr-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Exactly


[02-Apr-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	I think the idea that an economic and logistical simulation is ideally run by anarcho-capitalist principles is so absurd that I don't even know where to begin.


[02-Apr-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	Because, you know, anarcho-capitalists have never demonstrated a capacity for either economics nor logistics.


[02-Apr-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	They are, at best, hyper-efficient actors in a system designed in a manner antithetical to their stated principles. However, their revealed preference is to live in societies where these problems are handled by competent central authorities.


[02-Apr-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	It's fine for individuals to engage with an economy in this manner because they bear no responsibility for the functioning of society as a hole, but an anarcho-capitalist opining on politics is a man who cuts off his own legs to reduce his weight so he can run faster.


[02-Apr-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	Clown behavior. Read a book.


[02-Apr-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	*whole


[02-Apr-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	I personally will not let Avalon turn into Cyberpunk 2077


[02-Apr-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	Trust


[02-Apr-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I don't think governance in this game should be a volunteer or, in some cases, charitable position where you're paying out of your own pocket to cover upkeep (unless your planet is some sort of weird pet project where you want to do that sort of thing).


[02-Apr-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i personally will not let avalon be bleak and non cyberpuck


[02-Apr-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	@Masonwater My mortal enemy... We meet at last


[02-Apr-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i will not stand by and let you rob our dear citizens of the greatest mankind has to offer, cyberpsychosis!


[02-Apr-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Jeez.  Avalon chat is getting so spicy that it might turn my RAT into FIM.


[02-Apr-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Hail Governor MysteriousWalrus though.  Heck of a guy.


[02-Apr-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	i had to tell my bf about it, being the most interesting thing that has happened in a few months lmao


[02-Apr-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	N-No! Don't provide corporations more control over our lives! We will never acquire full liberation from the scourge that is taxes!


[02-Apr-24 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	always glad to provide some spice and entertainment.


[02-Apr-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm pretty sure Worvand has put even more into Avalon than I have. If we were involved in Avalon's government to get rich we'd be doing a pretty terrible job of it.


[02-Apr-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	haha ya.


[02-Apr-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Both of you have put close to 2,500,000 ICA each towards the development of Avalon.


[02-Apr-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	you can only get so rich, at some point you just start hoarding money to make a number go up. got to put it somewhere useful


[02-Apr-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I don't need or want any sort of pat on the back or recognition for it, I'd just like to not be called a robber.


[02-Apr-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	agreed.


[02-Apr-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Interesting change in the TEC employment rate 🤔


[03-Apr-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	Why'd it go down when there was a technician immigration program?


[03-Apr-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	low happines?


[03-Apr-24 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Someone built a lot of TEC buildings, which is why I thought it was interesting


[03-Apr-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	I think it is 770 new tech jobs (I added 280 of those with 4xIVP) -- so probably another 7xIVP from others considering the MTP market


[03-Apr-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TherenShadowborn**:	I don't know enough about how population works, but is there anything that can be done to stop the slow loss of Technicians from Avalon?

**JoeRider85**:	Pretty sure we have to make a sacrifice to the harvest god.  Well, I don't know that for sure -- but in the past when we have made sacrificial offerings, no technicians left.


[03-Apr-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TherenShadowborn**:	Not sure what that entails, but point me in the right direction!


[03-Apr-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think we need a governor to STEAL more taxes from us and then simply do their job and invest in infrastructure that will make tecs happy, so we can complain about it later /s


[03-Apr-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Lmaooo


[03-Apr-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ptdnxyz**:	you'd have to invest in TEC POPI or something to keep them from leaving


[03-Apr-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The TECs are definitely a bit unpredictable sometimes, I was already noticed a drop in unemployment but the numbers were hovering around the same. I'll bring over some more inputs when I have a ship over at HRT


[03-Apr-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll probably be bringing over some TUBs, STR, or both if anyone here happens to produce them somewhere. If not I'll just buy from the CX :]


[03-Apr-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Short term, I'm going to upkeep the INF and PAR a bit more, long term, I am going to put the surplus towards upgrading those a bit further in hopes of this not occurring again


[03-Apr-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TherenShadowborn**:	Again, I don't know much about the population, and I'm not super rich, but if there is anything I can do to help, let me know!


[03-Apr-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Appreciate the offer! It's probably just going to involve me shipping a few hundred thousand in parts to make us get TECs like 5-30% faster


[03-Apr-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	you better, Walrus, cuz that's a governor's job. don't expect a pat on the back for doing your obligation. sneaky thief. /s

[03-Apr-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Because he's the hero Avalon deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A Mysterious Walrus..

[10-Apr-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	^


[10-Apr-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The peeps running techs are likely IVP (MTP) - MEA bois.


[10-Apr-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Definitely - hopefully we'll have the TECs to accommodate them all


[10-Apr-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some also do use this MCG planet for advanced Metallurgy, Chemistry, and Manufacturing processes, that would be painful to do elsewhere.


[10-Apr-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye


[10-Apr-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Going forward I'll look into taxing other industries using TECs more than food industries. I'll think about that when I get home though


[10-Apr-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I can give you the most base rundown of the TEC pop tree. :)


[10-Apr-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The most useful ones, direct, are the HWP, LAB, PP3/TNP, for direct-to-market commodities. Everything else is involved in a intermediate category, there their O's are used for other I's, be they on higher, or lower pop requirements afterwards.


[10-Apr-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It'll be good for me to note this before election I suppose, I'll have to take a look at the finances and how much goes into maintaining TECs, but I could see a raise in the future for *Non food industries* Technicians. I am not going to raise any others next term.


[10-Apr-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Tbf for the Food-Instustry TECs, the IVP's through-put, in terms of commodity units per day, is rather LOW.


[10-Apr-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Player co-ops needs a bunch of them to be competitive.


[10-Apr-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hm, don't really know much about them as I only just built my first base using TECs


[10-Apr-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	2 FIM + 1 MTP -- @15.5 hrs --> 2 MEA...


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though yeah, I do recall all like +18h recipes on IVPs last I checked


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeahh


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1 PPA + 1 NS + 1 HCP -- 18 hrs --> 4 MTP


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You need a whole IVP base, just to feed a whole FP base, that is making MEA.


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If not more.


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That doesn't surprise me


[10-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	FPs go through stuff like crazy


[10-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Like almost 3 IVP bases XD


[10-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	IVPs are like almost 3x the size of an FP


[10-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	🥴


[10-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And they use almost x2 the popi, per building.


[10-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye


[10-Apr-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What's the decay percentage for migrating out? <50% happiness?


[10-Apr-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	pct.fnar.net


[10-Apr-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	70% for coming in, 50% for going out, I believe :p


[10-Apr-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though a lot of the specifics are harder to understand :o


[10-Apr-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	this has been fact checked as TRUE by an Avalon patriot


[10-Apr-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hahaha


[10-Apr-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ye, I think Archi's Gov planner spreadsheet works still, with the most recent FIO endpoints. You can run the buffers down to 50% satisfaction for the TECs. Of course, do note it here, and on UFO, if you plan on doing such.


[10-Apr-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Since popi happiness runs on a 5 week average, you could keep the #s up, but it will cost revenues that could be diverted elsewhere.


[10-Apr-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Archi's gov planner is very helpful, I can do without it but it's really really nice being able to see what *should* happen


[10-Apr-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It helps if players actually chatted with the govs on where they want to settle, especially withi higher tier pop considerations.


[10-Apr-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But, it doesn't really matter, as long as SET Happy < TEC Happy ---- and/or TEC Happy > 70%


[10-Apr-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Luckily I had some corp members wanting to help me with upkeep - I *want* to have a healthy buffer of TECs, we'll see how much it costs to upkeep them going forward 😅

[18-Apr-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If you hover your cursor over the gear icon at the top right of a buffer, you can click the horizontal bar to split the buffer in half, or you can click the vertical bar to split them in half vertically.


[18-Apr-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	Releasing Avalon's monthly report a bit early (1d early) as I will not be putting anything else into POPI, Programs, or CoGC within that time, but as expected after the TEC situation, POPI Upkeep went up a good bit, hence the Technician tax raise. Programs were down also due to the technicians, Tec programs cost a flat 50k while the Planetary Festivities are based on population. Note, this report doesn't reflect the 2.5m in donations from @Janelle1116, @worvand, @TheVanquish121, and @DeniedClimax.

**muad_dib**:	hello


[21-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	COLIQ and go to PRom


[21-May-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	hi


[21-May-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Howdy.  Abrupt but not incorrect advice.


[21-May-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Promitor is the place.


[21-May-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Context: Avalon is a good secondary planet option, Promitor being the place where many people produce crops that you can then turn into rations (or further stuff)


[21-May-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Promitor is full, plot wise - meaning you cannot get a spot on the planet without starting there. This is even more important due to it being the most fertile planet in the core of the galaxy :]


[21-May-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	So I'm not saying that you shouldn't start on Avalon, just that starting on Promitor is objectively better and you can always join us on Avalon after not too long to process your food :p


[21-May-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You *can* start on Avalon, but you *should* start on Promitor and come to *Avalon* for your second planet.


[21-May-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	^


[21-May-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I meant to put the second set of asterisks around second, not Avalon, but I have brain damage.


[21-May-24 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Brain damage is airborne here, it seems.


[21-May-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I'm not sleeping enough, it's ruining my life, and it's all my fault.


[21-May-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Hurray!


[21-May-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	<3


[21-May-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya the only way to get on promitor is to start on promitor, its a great planet and will never have a open base slot for those who didnt start on promitor. the planet pairs perfectly with avalon. why are you still reading this, restart on promitor


[21-May-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	(And then hurry back to Avalon for your second base.  We'd love to have you here.)


[21-May-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Hm starting on ava, now there's an interesting challenge.


[21-May-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**muad_dib**:	is vertical integration really that important?


[22-May-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muad_dib**:	why not just never have a base on promitor


[22-May-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Prom has unique advantages discussed above that makes it desirable, and the only way to get in on it is to start there


[22-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	And imo vertical integration is only good in specific cases that will become very apparent if you play this game more


[22-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	COLIQ --> Promitor


[22-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	do it now


[22-May-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muad_dib**:	ok ill look into it :)


[22-May-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	I'm not asking


[22-May-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Look


[22-May-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	if you do restart on Prom, send me a DM and I'll give you 50k ICA


[22-May-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-May-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You listed purchase offers for less than any of the listed selling offer.


[24-May-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Additionally, your listings are cheaper than the highest purchase offer, so yours will only be fulfilled after those.


[24-May-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedWolf_ShadowFlame**:	i know but i want to get those ones fufilled


[24-May-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You'll need to wait an awfully long time or offer a higher price.


[24-May-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedWolf_ShadowFlame**:	k how do I edit orders?


[24-May-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You could have your orders fulfilled immediately if you offer a price that matches a sell offer.  In this case, that would be 1,460 ICA.


[24-May-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedWolf_ShadowFlame**:	k i do that now

**ZionOrion**:	looks like i can sell my RATs on LM and not have to transport them to station nice


[02-Jun-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You are correct.  It is a food processing world.


[02-Jun-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, plenty of people buy from the source.  Keep in mind that you're likely to have plenty of space on the return trip if you want to take your output elsewhere to sell though.


[02-Jun-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	The rations are a lot lighter than the crops.


[02-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	as i phase out the FP on Prom and turn them into Farms and maybe another INC or two


[02-Jun-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	think im gonna need another rig too


[02-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	I cant figure out how to add a second base to pruplanner though, i got my prom base all set up on there but cant figure out how to add a second


[02-Jun-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	is each base its own empire?


[02-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	No.  You need to make the plan for the second planet and then make sure it's assigned to the same empire as the first one from the Management screen.


[02-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	how do i add another planet?

[02-Jun-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	new base button is needed for the empire page or something


[02-Jun-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	There's a learning curve.


[02-Jun-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	No problem.


[02-Jun-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	PrUnPlanner is very nifty, especially once you have more than one base.


[02-Jun-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Definitely once you have more than one base o.o


[02-Jun-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	is there a way to tell it that i am importing my own raw mats instead of it calculating the cost of me buying them?


[02-Jun-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	like it saying i have to but GRN and BEA etc when i dont i can bring them in


[02-Jun-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	*buy


[02-Jun-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It'll show that on the empire screen.


[02-Jun-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can set price overrides as well, though I haven't bothered with that personally.


[02-Jun-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You used to have set set them all individually to get it to reflect it better, but PRUNplanner does a nicer job of that recently :p


[02-Jun-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ZionOrion**:	Now I can hurry up and wait even more!


[02-Jun-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Good luck! I don't wanna get in the way of your waiting ;]


[02-Jun-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You're welcome.


[02-Jun-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I want chat's opinion on this, so the politics update is coming up *sometime* soon. I want to know this: If the devs give us a bit of heads up on the update, would you guys be opposed to me temporarily raising taxes very soon before it to start the government off with a good bit more liquidity? (Note, the government will be a separate context and have it's own bank account after the update)


[02-Jun-24 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I will pay an amount greater than what I would have paid in increased taxes to hire an assassin.


[02-Jun-24 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Will said assassin usurp my role as governor after he finishes your task?


[02-Jun-24 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	where do i see current tax rate?


[02-Jun-24 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	LR VH-331g


[02-Jun-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Or go to PLI VH-331g, go to the top bar where there's context buttons and hit the one that says ^


[02-Jun-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	i must be blind


[02-Jun-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	i dont see it


[02-Jun-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Okay so, LR VH-331g, then under the fees tab, it has Production fees


[02-Jun-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	PIO/SET/TEC/ENG/SCI - 15/25/270/1080/1980 ICA


[02-Jun-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	ah thnx


[02-Jun-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	whats the proposed increase?


[02-Jun-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	When the update comes around, I could even do something like "temporarily raise PIOs to 30 and SETs to 40" Temporarily being probably the first two-three weeks of the update.


[02-Jun-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Doing that would probably/most likely give us a healthy amount of money in the government account to do stuff as usual


[02-Jun-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I defer to the governor's judgement.


[02-Jun-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Also when the time of the update comes around, I'll throw out a list of people I'd endorse for parliament, but that isn't necessary now ;]


[02-Jun-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	I'm too new to make an informed decision, I only have PIO currently and that would double my current tax. So I will defer to the wisdom of those who been here long enough


[02-Jun-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	In all honesty, taxes are barely noticeable unless your liquid assets are literally empty, but I try not to go overboard with it here, just taxing enough to cover the management


[02-Jun-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Most of the profit margins are wide enough for the taxes to be immaterial for the producer.


[02-Jun-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	Yeah I'm sure I can handle it, as I say just too new to fully understand what degree of impact


[02-Jun-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	In this situation, I consider the cost of mismanagement to be much worse than the cost of taxation.


[02-Jun-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	it certainly wont put me under lol


[02-Jun-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's very fair..I didn't understand any of it until my second month governing lmao


[02-Jun-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	ive got a solid income with my prom farms


[02-Jun-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SweatyGopher13**:	built a basic materials plant instead of smelter

**Filefolders**:	What happened?

[10-Jun-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	What start did you pick?


[10-Jun-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	wait I'm dumb I already had an extractor


[10-Jun-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	i was intending to make a smelter and now have it


[10-Jun-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	ok so I started to gather 9 units of mag and it says 17 hours that's real time correct?


[10-Jun-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	so Ijust come back tomorrow?


[10-Jun-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Correct.


[10-Jun-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	The start is slow, but it gives you a chance to get your bearings.


[10-Jun-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	okay and when I come back tomorrow I started gathering magnetite I'll start smelting


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	then once I smelt all the ore what do I do with it lol


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Actually, magnetite isn't smelted.


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	oof


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	what about Tectosilisite


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If you mine sulfur, though, that's smelted.


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	or sulfur crystals


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	okay


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	TS can be smelted or refined


[10-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Huh.  I forgot TS could be smelted.


[10-Jun-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Andy97**:	Yeah, probably


[10-Jun-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Anyway, once you have enough product to sell, load it on your ship and fly to Hortus Station, where the commodity exchange is.


[10-Jun-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	okay simple enough


[10-Jun-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh yeah, smelting it looks awful


[10-Jun-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	how much should i stockpile before going?


[10-Jun-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	my ships carry 500m3 so I should probably fill them up first


[10-Jun-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	I saw complaints in the reviews that the game was pay to win but I don't even see a cash shop


[10-Jun-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Drag the fuel slider all the way down to make it a nice, slow flight.  Flight time and fuel consumption are not linear, so you want to save as much fuel as you can.


[10-Jun-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	There's a subscription model, but you keep important subscriber features after it lapses.  Think of this as the free demo.


[10-Jun-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It's not pay to win for sure


[10-Jun-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I'm pretty reluctant to play subscription games, but the people calling this pay-to-win are being unreasonable.


[10-Jun-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yep


[10-Jun-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If you decide you like it enough in a month of two to stick around, consider whether the subscriber features are worth it to you.

[10-Jun-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	some integer value is required for FRM/ORC building construction/use. HYF require nothing, but there's I/O consequences from them.


[13-Jun-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, watering HYF and keeping them in nutrient solution is somewhat intensive.


[13-Jun-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can get some pretty impressive throughput with them though.


[13-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Unless you want to grow grain, in which case you need amber waves of grain, not rows of nutrient trays.


[13-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jun-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	PIOs won't run away, and everything else should be stable, provided that you have Comfort/Culture accounted for.


[15-Jun-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	It's pretty straightforward. most of PIO needs come from bases themselves. Anything that's up and running will provide >50% of general needs. SETs will always be greather than PIOs in regards to Safety/Health, so they can be nerfed entirely if you don't want SETs being maintained.

**Roh**:	Since PIO needs will always be greater than 50, you can pretty much run a PIO satisfaction of >70%, which will ensure an influx for the education thing (which never ends). Unless you're gunning for TEC/ENG/SCI with extra Comfort/Culture/Education POPI, then you'll always be running insufficiencies regarding their upkeeps.


[15-Jun-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But that's with no unemployment. From what I've modelled on Promitor, as an example, it'll have to upgrade a few higher tier POPI so that it can provide satisfaction (currently seriously undersatisfied).


[15-Jun-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But once such upgrades happen, then you can indefinitely run with + migration, looping with - migration, with education accounted for, albeit with higher POPI upkeeps since people are employing significant numbers of higher tier pops there.


[15-Jun-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I mean yeah, you can argue with me, regarding what's optimal, but each gov can model their own stuff with things like Archiel's sheet, or running their own. It's not the point though. If you dont wan't such fat, higher tier POPI, just cut them down.

[21-Jun-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lguth3728**:	I recently started my second base here and was going to produce those anyway. So for me it would be cheaper to sell here then ship it back to hortus station.


[21-Jun-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lguth3728**:	yeah some of my output would head here for my own base. I would just end up with excess and was wondering if I could sell it.

[21-Jun-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm pretty sure the devs have balanced this sort of arrangement, since the COLIQ has an exponential timer, which increases per use (refer to the APEX manual for that one).


[21-Jun-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	or you need to get a feeling for how often your consumers are going to CX


[22-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	for non-consumables, many will keep 14day+ buffers, which means they're only buying from you every 14 days

**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	thats my experience with construction inputs at least


[22-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	But that is yet ANOTHER reason why a Prom start is nasty good. You can make a variety of food/agri products that have great margins AND sell super to reasonably fast


[22-Jun-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SweatyGopher13**:	around 180 might suffice


[22-Jun-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xflqr_**:	agreed, a restart on promitor is definitely the way


[22-Jun-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	Promitor is full though.  The only way to get a plot there is to start there.


[22-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	That's why so many people in this chat advoate liquidating your company and restarting on Promitor.


[22-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Promitor is EZ mode.


[22-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

In order to continue running Avalon like I have thus far, I'd like it if we could form one with me as Governor then @Andy97, @worvand, @Filefolders, and @--SCHAITR-- [$LUME]

[24-Jun-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's enough for me, but I would appreciate the expansion anyway.


[24-Jun-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@machioro I do have plans on getting it to 3000t/3000m - I've just been low in liquidty recently


[24-Jun-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's probably going to be occurring not too far from now, I do think upgrading the warehouse even further is just a long tern goal though :}

**marchioro**:	maybe I contribute some myself after all, no biggie


[24-Jun-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Honestly I can finish that upgrade next time I decide to send a ship here.


[25-Jun-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	that'd be lovely, I just screwed two people over with them shipping stuff to me here due to my lack of space (actually my poor planning that resulted in a lack of space)


[25-Jun-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	put up some RAT for sale, just below HRT prices, in case anyone is interested. expected delivery within 1 day and 7 hours. and no, it has nothing to do with me trying to free up space until we have an upgraded warehouse, dunno why you'd think that.


[25-Jun-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vention**:	I'm slowing my buying of RATs on-planet for the next week or so as I'll be away till next Monday and don't expect much internet access. Apologies I can't continue to help free up that space ;)

**Darth_Merkel**:	ohhh, that would be so cool!


[26-Jun-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm *guessing* the majority of planets will win with majority of people trying to keep the status quo


[26-Jun-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though Promitor and Avalon are the only planets I've seen where the incumbent has endorsed others :p


[26-Jun-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think the most interesting, and potentially dramatic scenarios, would be the ones where there are three distcint parties running, and all of them get a seat, and there is potential for the second and third places to try and unite against the governor


[26-Jun-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	although having a single party as opposition is already quite rare, from what I've seen, not to mention 2 opposing parties


[26-Jun-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	or maybe a flock of inexperienced players just run for the sake of it and fill out seats just to annoy the governor, who knows...


[26-Jun-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	talking about mid size planets though, don't think that would happen to planets like Prom or Avalon


[27-Jun-24 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

Andy and worvand, have put millions worth of building materials and inputs into the planets POPI, Filefolders has always been very helpful in this chat while also being leader of one of the bigger Insitor corporations. Schaitr is an obvious choice as long-term governor of Promitor and formerly Boucher - I like to think I've done a pretty good job managing the planet these past months, but with their support I hope to get Avalon in better shape.

[04-Jul-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Zugore, while I sort of understand the sentiment, the planet can not run off of goodwill. While you may not agree, while those donations were voluntary, they were by site owners on Avalon that wanted to help maintain Avalon's population and keep it running


[04-Jul-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Filefolders**:	He's a solid dude, but I will need to hear about his golf game before making a fully informed decision.


[04-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm definitely a golf God.


[04-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	here come global domination


[04-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You've never seen a swing like mine!


[04-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	this guy knows his way around holes


[04-Jul-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	no way around it


[04-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Oh, I can swing - hitting the ball is anbother matter entirely


[04-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It feels like every time I turn around Filefolders is in here helping newer players with something or another


[04-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	"People see my swing, and they tell me, 'You have the most beautiful swing I've ever seen!' It's true!"


[04-Jul-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think there's more than way of helping. being active in the help channel does give you some visibility, but doing what walrus does here and schaitr at prom is likely less noticiable, especially by newcomers. they have kept the status quo so far making it great for the majority, and I think they should continue to do so until they get bored.


[04-Jul-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	more than one way*


[04-Jul-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I think they should keep doing it even if they get bored.  None of you is allowed to quit until I decide you can quit.


[04-Jul-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Outstanding point File

[04-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Only reason I stopped the financial reports was because of the politics update, that kind of threw a wrench in that lmao


[04-Jul-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It'll be interesting to do if they do anything with the government accounting feedback the devs were soliciting on the forum.


[04-Jul-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	*interesting to see


[04-Jul-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Idk why the devs solicit feedback. They tried to implement GAAP, but it was never actually implemented? You'll notice in your company's books, that there's plenty of accounts for GOV related revenues and expenses, but for some reason, such things were ported to be only collected via CORP accounting, which is ever so general, and completely useless (especially since the politic update).


[04-Jul-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, it's not real GAAP.


[04-Jul-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	They could provide some simpler but more useful tools, which would be nice to see.


[04-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	What they should do, is clean up the redundancies in the CO accounting, basically remove corporate accounting (since there's no way to kick back revenues to an organization anymore), and actually make Ship Valuation work?


[04-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Sounds good to me.


[04-Jul-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you can post it on the forum if you want. Who know's if they'll listen, since they've got alot on their plate.


[04-Jul-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	They definitely do.


[04-Jul-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	god I hope they do


[04-Jul-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Oh, I meant they have a lot on their plate.


[04-Jul-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	I have a feeling that now that they've developed the government context system they may expand it to Corporations in the future


[04-Jul-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That would be cool


[04-Jul-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Part of the economic warfare system...


[04-Jul-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	conquering planets...


[04-Jul-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you'd be better off with checking out "Falling Frontier" on steam, if you want to conquer planets.


[04-Jul-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Expanse-esque RTS/TBS with a Sol-centric environment, ahead from us for like 300-400 years. It is looking very nice so far, release expected later this year.


[04-Jul-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I was going to ask if that was any good, but it's not out yet.


[04-Jul-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It looks pretty cool.


[04-Jul-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	"Enemy officers not killed in action can be captured and interrogated, or left in their escape pods as bait in order to ambush any rescue ships."


[04-Jul-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Ah, another war crime simulator for me to play.


[04-Jul-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	War crimes, all the way.


[04-Jul-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's not like the enlisted peeps should have any expectation of survival, upon contact, anyways. The stuff is beyond brutal.


[04-Jul-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Darth_Merkel**:	Good luck to all the candidates, may the best people win ^^


[04-Jul-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Darth_Merkel**:	And since im running, maybe just a few words: I've been governing a small farming planet for a few months now (by the way: settle on Chu GY-110c ! Tax free farming!) and would really appreciate the chance to learn from some Experts how to best govern a planet, especially a larger one.


[04-Jul-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	too bad, the experts only want to hang with their peeps - they don't want to teach other new folks - they just want yes men to ride their coat tails, so that the status quo doesn't change.


[04-Jul-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	good old if it aint broke dont fix it


[04-Jul-24 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	No one's saying it's broken, but if no one new is allowed to join the good ol' boys club....eventually we'll rum out of good ol' boys (and the knowledge and wisdom they could have passed along.


[04-Jul-24 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My problem is not with any of the individuals on the "ticket", it's the fact that there's a ticket - vote for me and my cronies or everything will go to hell in a hand-basket.


[04-Jul-24 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I like it the way it is, why the devs thought to change the system, who knows, I want to keep doing things my way without any input from anyone else - that's where I have issues.


[04-Jul-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	It's not the individuals or their past contributions or their performance in any particular role...just the superiority complex they espouse - no one other than who they say should be involved - doesn't much like we're voting for a governor, more a dictator - All Hail Walrus and his lackeys.


[04-Jul-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	At this point, I know even if I make it onto the parliament, I can't affect change - he'll be the governor, two of his lackeys will be there at his side and schaitr will just sit idly in his seat occupying space - just like at Verdant, no word, no vote, no show.


[04-Jul-24 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Cronies, huh?


[04-Jul-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	What change would you like to see? You've been here what, a week?


[04-Jul-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Global domination, much?


[04-Jul-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Do you know what sarcasm is?


[04-Jul-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Attitude


[04-Jul-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes, very much so


[04-Jul-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but on a stump, unless of course you're riding coattails


[04-Jul-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I have an attitude?


[04-Jul-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	did not say that, have never engaged with you


[04-Jul-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	don't know you from adam


[04-Jul-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And yet you're slandering me


[04-Jul-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	where have I mentioned you  by name? when have I slandered you?


[04-Jul-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Well, I'm one of those "lackeys" youre referring to


[04-Jul-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	unless you're multi-accounting and forgot to switch accounts


[04-Jul-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I never said the planet would turn into a hellhole if other people got elected, I simply stated that if people wanted to keep supporting the current administration, they should vote for the candidates I endorsed.


[04-Jul-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	^


[04-Jul-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I don't see what's so hard to understand about that


[04-Jul-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there, you've just identified yourself as his lackey, it's ok for you to identify as such but not for me to refer to you as such?


[04-Jul-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	He was using your word choice... hence the quotes


[04-Jul-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	touche, my words...


[04-Jul-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sentiment remains unchanged


[04-Jul-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You're really making a good pitch for your candidacy acting like this


[04-Jul-24 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm not acting like anything, I simply responded to a citizen that made a comment


[04-Jul-24 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You seem like somebody that I'd love to work with. Maybe that's why he endorsed certain people?


[04-Jul-24 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I just and rubbed the wrong way by your behavior in this chat. You come onto the planet just seven days ago and immediately run for a seat on Parliament, preaching how you're doing it to represent the newbies


[04-Jul-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	being a newbie myself, yeah -


[04-Jul-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm trying to be respectful but each message you've sent has been pretty passive aggressive.


[04-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I actually registered for the election before I built my base here, they're unrelated, as discussed earlier


[04-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Heh


[04-Jul-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	How's that better?


[04-Jul-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I already know and have admitted I cannot affect change here - my biggest issue is one faction holding 5 seats....not like it matters at this point, I've seen the new system from the inside already, and know that everything that is done will be in public view, so anything negative can only last a month.


[04-Jul-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm still curious what change you would like to see


[04-Jul-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I've never said you will do anyting negative or that you are a bad guy and should not be elected governor....never...you rubbed me the wrong way first with the me and my guys only exclusive club attitude....sorry, just the way I feel about it.


[04-Jul-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I don't believe I ever said I expected change in policy, Andy.


[04-Jul-24 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have never once said he Walrus was a bad governor or didn't deserve to be reelected or continue running the planet


[04-Jul-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm sorry gents you're not used to folks sharing their opinion with you.


[04-Jul-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	He's run the planet single-handedly for 8 months. What is so crazy about having one group run the planet?


[04-Jul-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And it's not just one group either


[04-Jul-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	The endorsement doesn't support that statement


[04-Jul-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm plenty used to people sharing their opinion with me


[04-Jul-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and countless folks have run countless planets single-handedly - so what, new system, new rules, new opportunities


[04-Jul-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yeah, and how exactly does endorsing people for parliament conflict with that?


[04-Jul-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	this really isn't about you Andy


[04-Jul-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yeah, it is


[04-Jul-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	The conversation to which I was referring earlier, with respect to words exchanged with the good Governor, did not occur in this room - so I can definitely say, this is not about you Andy.


[04-Jul-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Are you talking about our conversation on WB-675c?


[04-Jul-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	likely


[04-Jul-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes in fact


[04-Jul-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Likely 😭


[04-Jul-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(had to think for a minute sorry


[04-Jul-24 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	theres also Verdant


[04-Jul-24 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though I don't believe we've spoken there


[04-Jul-24 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	No, Shagie's doin a good job there so I'm less involved.


[04-Jul-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But I do believe conversations about governorship involving this planet, are relevant here.


[04-Jul-24 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You've been very talkative about governance on this planet in this chat the past few days


[04-Jul-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You keep talking about us as if we're gonna run this planet like the mob


[04-Jul-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	we are in the midst of an election andy and I'm not roding the coattails of the sitting governor, I think its appropriate to be discussing governance here, don't you?


[04-Jul-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It's appropriate, but it doesn't make sense to say it isn't about someone else


[04-Jul-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You aren't making any sense at all


[04-Jul-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I think it's perfectly fair to be discussing governance here


[04-Jul-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	But he's not running his own campaign, he's an attachment to yours


[04-Jul-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm just running to ensure he can continue to run the planet as well as he has


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and you tyhink I would be a detriment to that, andy?


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	And you are making a very good point of why it makes sense to do that


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yes


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Which is also technically his campaign, because as I said, he and worvand donated a lot to help upkeep this planet in the past


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Clearly


[04-Jul-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Them donating a lot to the planet and helping upkeep infrastructure is actually relevant, despite what you have said


[04-Jul-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Why do you think I pose a threat to his ability to continue to govern?


[04-Jul-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	What campaign are you running exactly? Any time I ask you for specifics on these nebulous arguments you keep making you just deflect.


[04-Jul-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I've never said their donations were not relevant, nor unappreciated.


[04-Jul-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You run for office on this planet and then land here less than a week ago and all I see from you is the same sort of antagonistic remarks


[04-Jul-24 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	What should I think of you?


[04-Jul-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	As I told your boss when he asked, I ran to represent the interests of my clients who do not have time IRL to be involved in politics IG; the base is a separate issue and came later to prepare for a new contract.


[04-Jul-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It's not really a separate issue


[04-Jul-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm curious as to what these "interests" are


[04-Jul-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You're complaining about how you won't be able to enact change but have nothing to say about what that "change" would be


[04-Jul-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm a decent, hard-working guy, who supports those coming up behind him, defers to those with wisdom and experience who are willing to share it, and supports the growth and development of the communities in which I reside and do business. That's who I am....I prefer inclusiveness to exclusivity, and that is where we are coming to a head.


[04-Jul-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	We started "coming to a head" before I had a clue who you were, that's where I'm confused


[04-Jul-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	did you ever ask?


[04-Jul-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	before thios conversation


[04-Jul-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	No. Like I said I've watched you go on and on about this for the last few days and then I got tired of biting my tongue.


[04-Jul-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	It's only been a day, I made a short stump pitch like everyone else just before the polls opened....and then this conversation this evening. Hours, not days....pace yourself, though, polls remain open for a week!


[04-Jul-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	On a side note - must be the fourth of July - it's like I'm in the middle of a live-fire exercise....but I'm surrounded 150-foot trees, so not a flash of light anywhere to be seen....just the constant barrage of explosions in the distance.


[04-Jul-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, all my neighbors are launching fireworks.  The dogs are thrilled.


[04-Jul-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I bet...


[04-Jul-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	It doesn't even have to be a "firework" holiday around here....they blast em off for  any old special occasion


[04-Jul-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	My immediate neighbors at least tend to stick to the two fireworks holidays.


[05-Jul-24 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	"Rich" discussions here on governing, much more than on Prom where I expected more 😅


[05-Jul-24 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Perhaps you can also share the reasons you have ran for elections and even governed planets that you don't have a base on @Zugore? I've always been curious about those


[05-Jul-24 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Better watch out @--SCHAITR--


[05-Jul-24 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	His corporate client might suddenly take an interest in Promitor!


[05-Jul-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	I find it hard to trust anyone that actively seeks political office, just saying


[05-Jul-24 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	Public servants are an extinct species I fear


[05-Jul-24 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	That may be an issue in a general sense, but as a long-time resident of planets managed by a couple of these candidates and a partial patron of a few planets myself, I know that these guys run a tight ship, sometimes at their own expense.


[05-Jul-24 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Promitor and Avalon have excellent staffing on minimal taxes, and the CoGCs run without a hitch.


[05-Jul-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Besides, there isn't a Prosperous Universe equivalent of Congressional insider trading, so there's not a whole lot of personal enrichment to be achieved through being an office hound.


[05-Jul-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I enjoy managing the population and most of the mechanics behind governance. I find it fun, but for the most part it's a thankless job and you can wind up sinking a lot of money into it really quick.


[05-Jul-24 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Exactly what Filefolders said


[05-Jul-24 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	That said, I can understand finding the behavior of office hounds annoying.  I can't do much for you on that front.


[05-Jul-24 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	There must be some level of "enrichment" for so many to be trying so hard


[05-Jul-24 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	The enrichment is preventing mismanagement of the planet where they do business.


[05-Jul-24 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Exactly


[05-Jul-24 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	But it also opens another fun aspect of the game to you


[05-Jul-24 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Probably also not infrequently a little megalomania too, but I can stomach that in exchange for good governance.


[05-Jul-24 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	@ZionOrion - to put it this way, I set a temporary tax raise on Avalon for Pioneers and Settles at +15 their original value and I don't think the planet is even breaking even after that :p


[05-Jul-24 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though as they said, I guess the 'enrichment' mostly comes from some degree of fulfillment while managing the planet. Not so much for my pockets.


[05-Jul-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Dont like any of the options? vote me, ill keep the seat warm and watch from the sidelines :D


[05-Jul-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Not at all ashamed to admit that I've been hired in the past to serve as a Sinecure Governor to assist in remote planet development - doesn't require a base, just time.


[05-Jul-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Promitor, they're there, but I lack the interest, frankly.


[05-Jul-24 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Other than that, the only base where I am on parliament, where I don't have a base is OZ-189a - where I'm planning a base, and my client has a base....doesn't prevent me from contributing to the planet.


[05-Jul-24 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Why? I want to learn, I want to serve - sorry, am I being selfish....


[05-Jul-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No that’s fine. I was really curious because I did remember seeing you running on quite a few planets I’m on, but that you didn’t have any bases on.


[05-Jul-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I’m sure you’d agree it’s reasonable to be worried when someone does that, especially when I really value having a stable governing body so we can all continue making money (or losses maybe)


[05-Jul-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	What would you like to learn about governing?


[05-Jul-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My ultimate goal i the game is to develop a planet from scratch, .like so many of you old-timers have done....I fully understand that requires a great deal of personal commitment and infrastructure (as well as liquidity)....so while working toward those precursors, I'd like to learn the ins and outs of managing the popi infrastructure - that at this point is my least understood aspect.


[05-Jul-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I did initially join the list on several other planets where my clients have a presence, but soon realized I should at least initially limit myself so as to be able to give each office its due time andattention.


[05-Jul-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My thought on all of these was not to swoop in and take over, hence my dismay when lowstrife for example withdrew at Prism, rather to join the respective teams and learn from the best of the best in the field.


[05-Jul-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Just as the planets can grow well without good governors, the global community cannot grow without planting the seed of wisdom and knowledge in the next generation.


[05-Jul-24 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	*can't


[05-Jul-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You could start by reading the POPI mechanics in the pct.fear.net website. I didn’t have anyone mentoring me when I started governing Boucher and just figured things out along the way by reading that and making my own clunky spreadsheets.


[05-Jul-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Now there are tools like Archiel’s governor spreadsheet to make life easier so the learning curve isn’t so steep anymore.


[05-Jul-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And just to share, there was usually no cause to “dethrone” the incumbent governor if they have been doing a good job, so most of us who are governors started from the small and faraway planets before slowly working our way up if we’re lucky


[05-Jul-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	(All of these in *old people voice*) 😉


[05-Jul-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Understood, and as stated, dethroning has not been the intent, but with the advent of the new system, it allows for learning from inside the system; so why not jump in and get my feet wet?


[05-Jul-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Heck we only had the experience from last universe and they changed how some stuff worked when this one started... we had to reverse engineer it and then someone made a awesome google sheet that most people use now


[05-Jul-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	regarding taxes: its a learn by doing thing


[05-Jul-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Glad


[05-Jul-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	adjust, see how much money comes in after 2 month, cause it takes a loooong time to adjust, then adjust again....


[05-Jul-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Gladi is one of the OG governors o7


[05-Jul-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	And tbh the new system is nice and all but it makes more work, cause now i got to make payment contracts to myself for feeding the planet...


[05-Jul-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I really wish they added a mechanic that pays people when they add to POPI and COGC


[05-Jul-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	instead of having to do all this paperwork in the contract system... -_-


[05-Jul-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	o/


[05-Jul-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the new system is a little more transparent, and fairly easy to use.


[05-Jul-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	its transparent, yes but puts more work on me


[05-Jul-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	its not easy to use


[05-Jul-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	well, easish*


[05-Jul-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my opinion, sorry, I've used it.


[05-Jul-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	how often? once?


[05-Jul-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	several times over the last week on two planets.


[05-Jul-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	You have to make the payment motions e v e r y week


[05-Jul-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	might as well remove repeating orders


[05-Jul-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	repetition is what wears players out and makes em leave the game


[05-Jul-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the whole game is repetition....


[05-Jul-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	the less there is, the better, so you can focus on the meaningful repetition


[05-Jul-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	makeing the same payment motion every x days is not meaningful


[05-Jul-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	the feature is incomplete - again - sadly - look at CONTD - we are still waiting on "repeating contract"


[05-Jul-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I learned a long time ago, I am not most people - and I have an odd sense of fun....what many would call dreary meaningless repetition, I enjoy...


[05-Jul-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	agreed repeating orders on ContD would be nice...I would use that frequently


[05-Jul-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	lets see how you feel in 300 or 600 days


[05-Jul-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and on the topic of learning, dont need the new system to learn. just ask - lots of people willing to teach. UFO discord best place for it


[05-Jul-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	But i also agree that the initial endorsment of Walrus kinda rubbed me the wrong way as it read like entitlement....


[05-Jul-24 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	On the logistics side of my operation, I clear over a 100 conts/week....admittedly, I have not been here long, no one's arguing that I'm new.


[05-Jul-24 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	A bit different wording could have gone a long way of not sounding entitled


[05-Jul-24 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and with that enjoy my 5 cents for what they are worth


[05-Jul-24 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	that I'm not new, sorry...


[05-Jul-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	entitled, not so sure about that....just keeping busy, playing my game.


[05-Jul-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so much resistance from the old hands....makes one start to wonder...


[05-Jul-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	the entitlement comment was not directed at you, read it again. its about walrus endorsement text. that you commented on as well and used the word "cronies"


[05-Jul-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	if i remember right


[05-Jul-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sorry, missed that little blurb (was typing)


[05-Jul-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	learning from inside the system alongside reading the textbook frankly is more fun, I'm a hybrid learner...


[05-Jul-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	idk


[05-Jul-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	I think it's reasonable to shill your preferred parliament


[05-Jul-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	whats entitled to me are old governors that can't be bothered to campaign


[05-Jul-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	ive seen that on way to many small planets


[05-Jul-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	agreed - curious to know what about the way it was put made you feel like it was an entitled comment, Gladi


[05-Jul-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	rereading it, maybe it sounds a bit like Walrus didn't consider the possibility of not being reelected?


[05-Jul-24 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	it read to me like "they did x in the past, vote them in now" maybe something alongthe lines of "they did x in the past, it would be great/nice/awesome if you honor that with voting them in"


[05-Jul-24 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	thats how i received it


[05-Jul-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	gotcha


[05-Jul-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	yea this governor stuff is getting annoying now


[05-Jul-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	there was a KAWA post thats getting really easy to emphasize with


[05-Jul-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	Proxion?


[05-Jul-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	might have been related, but its in the discords


[05-Jul-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Lapsed you mean the discussion or the goverment system?


[05-Jul-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	well its the government system --> discussion pipeline thats getting annoying


[05-Jul-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	the crux is lots of OGs have been running planets pretty tight or at significant losses


[05-Jul-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	and all of a sudden people have very strong opinions about minor things


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	ah well, you know the fun part? you get the discussions in 30 days again :D


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	if I were a governor paying for ~200 people I'd be steamin


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	maybe


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	we'll see


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and then maybe one more time and then its back to normal :D


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	this is definitely as lively as it'll be


[05-Jul-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	yea


[05-Jul-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I don't have bases in too many big planets, I have fun with a bit of the drama to be honest, but I can see it getting old the more often you see it


[05-Jul-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	well at least we're not ANT


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	what's up with them?


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	you've got a couple bases up there, surprised you haven't seen it


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Rise vs. OOG


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	some pretty desirable planets are having runoffs right now


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	maybe the ones I got are a bit more chill


[05-Jul-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	only thing I find it funny is having so many planets close to the CX that are fertile and are not agri COGC


[05-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	lol


[05-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	they make more than RAT in ANT


[05-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Harmonia seems like it would be it contention


[05-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	looks like its still got a few days until the election kicks off though


[05-Jul-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think it's the last non full planet that still has agri


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	in ANT?


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	100%


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	yeah


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	There are HYF shenanigans going on in that ice station system


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	but for regular players, yea


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	and I've seen close votes I think it was in Phobos, between agri and something else


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	( :


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Phobos WILL return to tradition


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	EDC farmers will be deported


[05-Jul-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I hope so, was planning to go there anyway


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I somehow still hope to get a spot on deimos


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	its hopeless


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	but same


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I mean, why take a fertile planet for that, aren't there any other rocky planets with no extreme conditions that you can use?


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	no for the deimos plot


[05-Jul-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	oh its just a little trolling


[05-Jul-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	no one actually wants Phobos to be agri except for a few native Phobians


[05-Jul-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	I personally want it food industries


[05-Jul-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	well, I might wanna focus on DW a bit more then


[05-Jul-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	As promised - the temporary tax raise has been brought to an end. While I do think the current tax rate will need to be re-evaluted sometime, I'll let the next collective administration figure out a gameplan on that rather than just myself.

**Roh**:	^^ Yes. Many play like this. Trial users are forced into a single-player focus, since they only get to experience, rather indirect, and rather statistically determined player action on the CX. They can't contract/negotiate with other players.


[14-Jul-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's sort of the same with BASICs, but they have almost the same limitations that trial users have, albeit with a few workarounds.

**Belladonna**:	i have a honest question I've been playing mmos for the past 15 years and the cost for pro is only like 8 bucks a month and yet i see a lot of people complain (the steam reviews especcially) why are so many people outraged at the price? its pretty low as far as mmos go?


[15-Jul-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Belladonna**:	im not saying anyone here is complaing just somthing ive noticed in general


[15-Jul-24 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the only response to that I've ever heard in here is that in some countries, 8 bucks is alot - key to remember this is a German game with an international audience

**Filefolders**:	I think people have a hangup about the price because it's a browser game.


[15-Jul-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I agree with your assessment.  It's a pretty reasonable price for an MMO.


[15-Jul-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	cheaper than going to a movie and way more than two hours of entertainment


[15-Jul-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I definitely see it that way.


[15-Jul-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's cheaper than Runescape these days if we want to compare browser MMOs.

**roganartu**:	hello friends. If anyone is interested in joining a group project making various workforce consumables in and around HRT, drop me a DM either in-game or in discord (same username). Low stress, no interest loans are available for new people (this project is how I got my start in the game over a year ago) and profits are split weekly, paid out in the consumables the group produces (working out to a pretty consistent 50k/d profit per base). We're looking for bases on Prom, Avalon, and Boucher to fill in for some people who have since quit the game

**lowstrife**:	I'd like to remind the government they should be running the 20% happiness program


[18-Sep-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you would be able to cut taxes in half if you run the program


[18-Sep-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	(consistently instead of 5% sometimes and 0% others)


[18-Sep-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I replied on Sand and I'll reply here - I run programs according to the unemployment of the different tiers of population. It's not just as simple as 'running PF III then all the issues go away' - If you consistently run PF III, SETs grow too high, take away too much of the POPI from the other tiers and issues start to arise


[18-Sep-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you use it once a month to boost the population in conjunction with popi


[18-Sep-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and then fund popi minimally to keep happiness above 50%


[18-Sep-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or however often is necessary


[18-Sep-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'd also recommend using FOD instead of DW


[18-Sep-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	excuse me, using DW instead of FOD lol


[18-Sep-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I make the FOD


[18-Sep-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	:p


[18-Sep-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well we're paying $50,000\day to loose 1600, 2000 and 700 pop


[18-Sep-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or can pay $30,000\day running fest3 and OFF in the SST; to lose 500, +1500, -400


[18-Sep-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	would require a lot less money to be spend during growth phases


[18-Sep-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I agree it raises the cost of unemployed settlers


[18-Sep-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I think overall net it's much cheaper

[21-Sep-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	25 conts working in and around HRT atm


[21-Sep-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think there's more shipping TO Avalon than FROM


[21-Sep-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	'duh


[21-Sep-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	true, in the current batch I've got 1 FROM to 4 TO

**Roh**:	Material compression is a thing, in Prun...


[21-Sep-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I was saying because it may not be obvious to people starting out


[21-Sep-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Compress the ores, ship to where ever, in serious quantity, and then refine and make... As compared to shipping regular ores.


[21-Sep-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's evident, if people align themselves to COGC metrics... Extract ores here... ship to there... Refine metals there...


[21-Sep-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But there's only 2 ways people notice those relationships....


[21-Sep-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1) Their shipping is getting bogged down with I/Os, since they expanded too fast....


[21-Sep-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	2) They pay very close attention to the Prunplanner I/O metrics, and do the maths.


[21-Sep-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	<--- Learned the hard way... 1st base Promitor... 2nd base Phobos.. Shipping was split 50/50. Now I dedicate shipping, before I start something fresh.


[21-Sep-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Sep-24 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	@Talmar - you only have one base that's slightly remote (XG-452f), your others are either in CX systems or along major shipping routes. 10ncc per t/m3 is the standard 3-day shipping rate. You might think LB-599a is remote, but really it's not - it's midway between MOR and HRT, and there are those of us that do LM shipping routinely that make that trip on a regular basis.

[22-Sep-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I don't have 500/500 ships anymore - that's one load (and a partial at that)


[22-Sep-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Sep-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Ehhhh, unless you're thinking of farming on Prom it isn't gonna get a ton better.


[23-Sep-24 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Early game is very, very slow regardless.


[23-Sep-24 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeaah


[23-Sep-24 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	that why Im thinking of doing it now instead of later


[23-Sep-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Couple days spent figuring out the basics before a COLIQ is hardly abnormal. I did the exact same thing, started on Avalon, realized it wasn't real viable for what I was trying, and then restarted on Prom.


[23-Sep-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oh Im a returning player, I stopped playing about two years ago and had to restart and forgot what the beginning was like.


[23-Sep-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Oh, well, yeah. You've got a pretty good grip on what to look forward to then, I imagine.


[23-Sep-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah


[23-Sep-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I just forgot about the long transit times :(


[23-Sep-24 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	Get a loan if you want to skip a bit of the slow start


[23-Sep-24 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	oh, yeah


[23-Sep-24 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	that wasnt a thing last I played but I saw it when I was playing around with the contract thing today.


[23-Sep-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I'd still consider starting on Promitor just so you can have a base there, since the planet is full and you can't have a base there unless you start there. Being able to farm close to the CX is good if you are going for a Victualler start


[23-Sep-24 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	yeah


[23-Sep-24 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	I was thinking construction or manufacturing as the start


[23-Sep-24 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	Montem in NC space is also overpopulated and a reasonably good planet for construction.


[23-Sep-24 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	hmmm


[23-Sep-24 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KyZekk**:	hmm I guess I'll just stick it out.


[23-Sep-24 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prisma**:	the temptation to put some 20 sets at CX price on the market is strong


[03-Oct-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vention**:	Curious the thought process of selling food products on a food processing world at above local CX ask


[03-Oct-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vention**:	I mean don't get me wrong I buy a crapload of food here on top of my own production, but at roughly CX bid price - any higher than that and I'd be better off buying at the CX


[03-Oct-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Handy for folks who aren't producing that item and don't want to transport it.


[03-Oct-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so then you admit you're saving on transport costs but still charging a premium?


[03-Oct-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just busting your chops - 650 is cheap - I produce and sell COF in MOR (and usually at 650 - which is way under market there)


[03-Oct-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Plontz**:	@pomme my exact thought process and @prisma that would be funny, wouldnt even be mad


[03-Oct-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vention**:	Fair enough - my assumption would be that a food processing planet is one of the least likely places to find buyers of food products at price points like that - but if there are buyers then hell yeah!


[03-Oct-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Plontz**:	it is, but the price to put them on the LM isnt a lot and its less to put in the cargo to bring to the CX saving more room for rats


[04-Oct-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	last call to ship stuff to ANT :eyes:


[04-Oct-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Vention those assumptions usually do ring true. FI COGC? Likely little to no offers to provision raw mats. Shipping ads usually run along the same way. Lots in, less out.


[04-Oct-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Although, you will usually get alot of purchase ads, for commodities of COGC significant, to be purchased on the cheap, by opportunists.


[04-Oct-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	To the uninitiated TRIAL/BASIC user... any PRO can just spot check those LM ppus with a CXM buffer.


[04-Oct-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**marchioro**:	if the government feels like I could get some return, I'd appreciate it, if not that's fine as well.


[09-Nov-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@machioro, what's your total cost of construction?


[09-Nov-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I brought it up in govchat for discussion.


[09-Nov-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm sure that GOV here can trickle in some rebates for you, if you give basic numbers,


[09-Nov-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, that'd be appreciated.


[09-Nov-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	if you haven't dropped gov stuff anywhere else, it's a simple figure in your FIN sheet, unless you've kept your own reciepts, which you need only add up.


[09-Nov-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I don't think I donated anywhere else recently


[09-Nov-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	where exactly would I see it on FIN?


[09-Nov-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	FINIS ---> Planetary Project Contributions


[09-Nov-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	oh, I see it


[09-Nov-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's the general expense category, for any POPI/PPS upkeep/upgrade materials donates


[09-Nov-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	it says 1,729,655


[09-Nov-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	for?


[09-Nov-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	remind me


[09-Nov-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	warehouse. 100% from level 12 to 13, and a good chunk from 11 to 12.


[09-Nov-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	in total, 240 TRU, 288 BDE and BBH, 74 BSE an 3300 MCG


[09-Nov-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	... I'll concur.... not that I'm partial, but my non-FIO integrated sheet says 1,894,000 ICA for the sum of WAR upgrades from 11 --> 13.


[09-Nov-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So it should be up to Avalon GOV, if they want to give rebates to you... I'd just keep a receipt of that expense, for the long term....


[09-Nov-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Based on current fees....


[09-Nov-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	if I take current sell values from the CX, it's 108k + 673.9k + 731.5k + 122k + 115.1k


[09-Nov-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	oh, cool, you did the math alright


[09-Nov-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	aside from the BSE that I had laying around on my wh, everything else I purchased recently


[09-Nov-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah I did, for custom private stuff with my friendies.... Your noted expense of 1,729,655 ICA should be considered, under the given figure of 372 warehouse units, rented @ 100 ICA per week, at 37,200 ICA GOV warehousing fees per week, at an amortization of 47 weeks in total.. Less if they want to pay you more for it.


[09-Nov-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's at 0% interest btw.


[09-Nov-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Out of curiosity, why'd you opt to upgrade it solo?


[09-Nov-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes, this is a good question ^


[09-Nov-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	... they're on Avalon? LOL


[09-Nov-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	just did the whole math here, got to roughly 1.75M for the quantities I mentioned. The BSE must have been bought for cheaper back then. Or maybe some stuff I had gotten from faction contracts as well.


[09-Nov-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	mmmm, no.


[09-Nov-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	well, storage is never too much, is it?


[09-Nov-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I asked for receipts, not maths... Current FIO/APEX figures for ASK rate purchases should never figure into GOV contributions.


[09-Nov-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Bit of a question of cost vs. benefit at some point.


[09-Nov-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I had upgraded other warehouses in other bases where the government paid some cash back, I'm just curious if that practice would take place here as well


[09-Nov-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I'm not demmanding anything


[09-Nov-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I can't promise it unilaterally, but I've brought it up in the government chat and I would like to think that some degree of compensation is likely.


[09-Nov-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	cool, thanks for letting me know


[09-Nov-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think that if everyone contributed, everyone would have the equivalent to a STO, without having to give up precious are that could have more FIMs


[09-Nov-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	area*


[09-Nov-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Might be something to budget for in the long term.


[09-Nov-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You've got my amortization numbers for it....


[09-Nov-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	47 weeks is almost a year, btw.


[09-Nov-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, long time to recoup it in rental fees.


[09-Nov-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Mind you, the contributor will suffer from long-term inflation rates.


[09-Nov-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I'm confused - are you talking about it from a government perspective?


[09-Nov-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes... I am.


[09-Nov-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	ok, that makes sense then.


[09-Nov-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Its how I amortize Pallada's unnecessary "upgrades"... Long term debt, at 0% interest, and at 0% inflationary adjustments.


[09-Nov-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	pure figures, with pure payouts.


[09-Nov-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Government isn't really a business though, so at some point it becomes not so much a question of time to pay off, but rather the value of WH space vs. lower taxes.


[09-Nov-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	At any rate, Marchioro, I'll try to keep tabs on it and let you know how it pans out.


[09-Nov-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well... kinda? Avalon's on-track to start engaging in UNI construction....


[09-Nov-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I hate to mention it, but your TEC POPRs are out of scale --- too many TECs... and people are starting to maintain ENG BUIs...


[09-Nov-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	These things, are of course, a GOV concern on Avalon.


[09-Nov-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You have the powa'h, to say yes, or no, to such macro-economic developments.


[09-Nov-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Anyways, it was a good chat @machioro and @Pomme. :P


[09-Nov-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Thanks. And yeah, I dunno how much of that is driven by IVPs.


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Only 10.5% unemployment, so I'm guessing quite a few.


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	would you like to send a g-sheet to me?


[09-Nov-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	it will involve a  LOT of clicking for you....


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Maybe another time. I'm a junior parliament member, so probably less effort overall to simply question Walrus about things.


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Appreciate the offer though.


[09-Nov-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	well, find someone who can... 500k ICA for the effort of compiling a spreadsheet, involving PPI entries of Name; Operator; Founded: Developed Area; and Primary Industry........ Example: [     PPI f56b4482    ].

[09-Nov-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Little strange that that's not able to be pulled out of FIO


[09-Nov-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Curious, how're you utilizing that?


[09-Nov-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Avalon, since you get your numbers for taxes and whatnot.. And I can also plug that info in to a larger stats distribution.


[09-Nov-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can't pull it via FIO... No endpoints for it...


[09-Nov-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	That's a bit irritating.


[09-Nov-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Ah well, maybe if I get exceptionally bored at work sometime.


[09-Nov-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I know maths? I can structure a custom stats distribution. :P


[09-Nov-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	The real annoying part is that it isn't simply a one-time effort.


[09-Nov-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, I just need a bored person, with a good 1-3 hours of time, on a very decent computer to pull this off, since yeah, no dev + FIO support for this.


[09-Nov-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Wait, do PPI names change with new owners, or are they static per plot?


[09-Nov-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	New owners for public plots.... Past the hash/hex valuations beyond planetary permit limits, is the discrete cutoff for ghost-plot naming....


[09-Nov-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hence for Avalon, the first #420 who keep their plots long-term, basically derive any stats that can be wrung by hand atm.. Once we get dev + FIO support, it may be a game changer regarding tax brackets, but I think most are just doing guestimates for everything.

[12-Nov-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	A bit of an update for everyone on government business: @marchioro was reimbursed about half of the estimated value of materials spent on the upgrade mentioned earlier in chat. The logic behind this was that there's a point of diminishing returns on the upgrades as a value proposition. To set expectations for everyone going forward, the best policy is to inquire before doing any sort of POPI/upgrade spending and hash out terms in advance.


[12-Nov-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Having said that, I'd personally like to extend my thanks for the general civic benefit attitude espoused by marchioro, since it was done explicitly without the expectation of repayment.


[12-Nov-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Depends on what exactly it entails.


[15-Dec-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	What consumables are you looking to source? I assume it's not literally everything for your base if you're doing all the shipping, unless you're stipulating collection at HRT or something.


[15-Dec-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	No, just RAT, DW, and

[15-Dec-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I should have a sublight WCB shuttle coming online in the system sometime in the next couple weeks and I excess production of DW/RATs for a bit, but depending on how much we're talking it likely wouldn't be hard for me to purchase off of HRT and squeeze it in alongside my stuff going to Avalon for processing.


[15-Dec-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	I see what you mean


[15-Dec-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	not much, for DW and RAT about 46 per day


[15-Dec-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	are you looking to collect that daily, weekly, or monthly?


[15-Dec-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	46/d or 322/w or 1380/m?


[15-Dec-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	daily conts are tedious and leave you open to mishaps should a day or two get missed - not recommended


[15-Dec-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-25 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	It's crazy how many people have been runing here, even more than Prom


[19-Feb-25 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Its cuz -- if you haven't started on Prom, you'll never get there. Avalon is the next best thing.


[19-Feb-25 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Your boss is telling you to vote for MysteriousWalrus?  Wow, he really has some pull.


[20-Feb-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Eh. I'd usually be rofl'ing at ^ that. But I'm looking at different metrics... Lets See. GOV VH-331g ... term #44 (first term under the politics update) --- 53 votes tallied... The Latest Term #51 --- 26 votes tallied.


[20-Feb-25 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	A drastic drop? Perhaps. Maybe this whole politics thing is just a bore for people? Who knows.


[20-Feb-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	It can be, especially when the governor is someone like MysteriousWalrus or SHAITR who can basically run things on their own


[20-Feb-25 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	Doesn’t give parliament too much to do


[20-Feb-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Sort of, kind-of? Most of the maths behind GOV stuff just centers around "reasonable" LR rates, which eventually brings in a flow of revenues to fund 1) COGCs, 2) POPI upkeeps... and 3) POPI upgrades. But that's just #napkin maths.


[20-Feb-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most of the real work comes in supplying #'s 1 --> 3, on a monthly basis, which people have to use their ships + capital to do the work... And then eventually file motions for reimbursement of said expenses, and whatnot.


[20-Feb-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	with an active parliament, said gov doesn't have to wait 24 hours for the reimbursement, or to activate programs/changes/etc


[20-Feb-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Life happens.. Most big planets have to wait 24 hours anyways... Just plug the motions 1 day ahead of time, and you basically have the problem solved?


[20-Feb-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Easy to type. Hard to do.


[20-Feb-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	hmmm, I do have an idea though....


[20-Feb-25 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lets say, the LR rates on any planet get increased just slightly... The added surplus revenues can then be used to justify salaries for "busy work" for any interested PM members on said planet, to then ... say ... plug in accounting figures on a group g-sheet... to plug in motion details per GOV direction... and so on.


[20-Feb-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People have to start somewhere in their life experiences, and well... If you're facing a brick wall of politics, you might as well volunteer some of your time to plug in some #deets, on a minuscule pay-roll. Why? You'll learn the metrics really fast. :)


[20-Feb-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm just floating that idea. :P


[20-Feb-25 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Salary has been raised some places.  I'm not sure of anyone who actually does it though.


[20-Feb-25 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Potchama**:	What are "#deets"?


[20-Feb-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's more applicable on the larger planets. The small 1 --> 20 person project colonies out there don't need them, since the GOVs there handle everything... But there's room on the larger planets to make room, and to give work, to anyone interested....


[20-Feb-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Deets? Uhm.....


[20-Feb-25 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Weekly accounting details. If you've secured an office somewhere, then you get to switch "screens", that shows you the planet's finances, on a weekly basis, from every Sunday at 2400 UST? or something like that.


[20-Feb-25 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Potchama**:	Oh, I see


[20-Feb-25 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Players don't see that either. It's basically "hidden".


[20-Feb-25 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The stuff is not particularly useful.... since If I do some maths on your planet, you won't have to worry about pretty much anything for a few years in terms of "reasonable" GOV revenues... But then I'll be killing off any learning experiences that people might want.


[20-Feb-25 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm just trying to eek out as much larping and fun that I can see... that is possible in this game.. The larping doesn't have to be competitive either... since whatever people learn, or look into during their PM days ... can be easily applied when they form their own CORP and start up some new colony, on some planet in this verse.


[20-Feb-25 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's whatever. I'm gone for the day.,

[25-Feb-25 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	specifically weas just the min max gauge, otherwise I agree I'm not too worried about fuel. but I have recently added an stl only HCB to my 'fleet' that is now maybe a third full and was morbidly curious if the differences would amount to anything, at this point


[25-Feb-25 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	also the distance here to HRT is of little consequence anyway lol but was just being extra lol


[25-Feb-25 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-25 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-25 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	right kinda my thinking. my operation of 3 bases this system 4 ships would have 2 sitting somewhere and I wouldn't say I'm working towards anything atm. so gonna try out 1 ship flying slow around on just STL and then move the rest of my boats to the otherside of the universe

**BallPython2727**:	hey does anyone wanna buy some rations on Avalon? Ima have 700 in abt an hour and don't feel like shipping to cxl


[03-Mar-25 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BallPython2727**:	I'd sell for 155 a piece


[03-Mar-25 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	RAT.IC1


[03-Mar-25 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Avalon is an FI world, so lots of folks produce RAT here, you don't get to charge a premium above CX ask for the convenience - you're selling your surplus production, bulk buyers will take it off your hands at a discount (saves you the shipping).


[03-Mar-25 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	for example, I took 7 contracts off Avalon LM this morning for 500 RAT @ 150 each....


[03-Mar-25 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BallPython2727**:	alr


[03-Mar-25 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	convenience charges are expected on non-FI worlds - the further out, the higher the surcharge


[03-Mar-25 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you might reach out to @drafangravanc or @Vention - couple bulk rat buyers on Avalon


[03-Mar-25 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BallPython2727**:	bet thx


[03-Mar-25 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	more than likely, the 3500 RAT I;m selling at 150 on Avalon LM will end up at Moria or Antares CX's (RAT.NC1 OR RAT.AI1)


[03-Mar-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrafanGravanc**:	@BallPython2727 I just posted a few more LM ads for RATs. I'm always looking to buy :]


[03-Mar-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrafanGravanc**:	And yeah in general, a lot of folks make RATs on Avalon, so prices tend to be a little under CX rather than over.


[03-Mar-25 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BallPython2727**:	good to know, I think I was having a brain fart bc it was a monday morning and all

[03-Mar-25 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	The nearest big one I know is Epicer, out in the same system as Boucher.


[03-Mar-25 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-25 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CoinCrafter23**:	^vh-331h


[04-Mar-25 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Been eyeballing that, but...ugh. BL.


[04-Mar-25 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Hey, Dzentak, let's you and me lead a revolt on Dreamerr Prime to oust the current governor and make it a FP planet.


[04-Mar-25 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm sure if we team up we can take out this...uh...Dzentak...guy...


[04-Mar-25 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	nah i like the electronics too much :)


[04-Mar-25 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	What've you got over there, anyway?


[04-Mar-25 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	myself i'm just running edc on dreamerr


[04-Mar-25 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Honestly -h might be the better swap in the long term if the trend is going to be toward EDC/IDC. Shipping hardly matters for it and at that level of income the repairs don't really either, especially since BL use is reduced with a base built for that vs. a FP farm.


[04-Mar-25 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	dreamerr requires HSE instead of BL


[04-Mar-25 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	HSE.IC1 BL.IC1


[04-Mar-25 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	So it does, for some reason I was thinking it was INS/SEA


[04-Mar-25 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, no point in that then.


[04-Mar-25 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i intend to keep dreamerr electronics :)


[04-Mar-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, it made some degree of sense if it was SEA, but HSE? Nah.


[04-Mar-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Irksome as it is, I may end up settling on -h then.


[04-Mar-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i also had J setup as a HYF Agri COGC but I decided to allocate my permits elsewhere


[04-Mar-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, permits getting dear are why I'm looking at it at all. Looking to trade in my 3 here for a 1/1 split.


[04-Mar-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	so that's an open planet for someone to play with too that i'm not managing anymore


[04-Mar-25 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i already put in some basic infrastructure :)


[04-Mar-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	That's a thought.


[04-Mar-25 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	J is INS only


[04-Mar-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, I've just gotta figure out what my FP needs really are, especially in relation to water.


[04-Mar-25 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Would make sense to park something more FIM/MEA oriented out there, maybe, but at the same time a 3rd FP spec'd planet in the system just seems a waste. OTOH all the water for a HYF planet would suck.


[04-Mar-25 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i was just using it for rations. if you're concerned about the water hauling the HCB definitely makes that a bit easier, moving 25k h2o at a time


[04-Mar-25 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Nah, I wouldn't be using it as a HYF planet, I was just weighing the possible utility for folks down the line vs. my own individual needs.


[04-Mar-25 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	No interest in it as anything but a cheaper upkeep food industries planet personally.


[04-Mar-25 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I was looking at J this morning actually as a possible HYF destination (since I can't get on Prom)....but a second FI in system could work too


[04-Mar-25 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	^since all my bases are single-permit


[05-Mar-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	it would be a 3rd FP

[26-Mar-25 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	for farms, between beans and nuts since they occupy the same spot in RAT recipes, beans output more stuff but costs more in water


[26-Mar-25 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	if you valued both of them the same, BEA starts to become better when the price goes up or if the price of water goes down.


[26-Mar-25 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	sorry, thats a mistake, beans don't occupy the same spot as nut


[26-Mar-25 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	beans contest ALG and MUS for the spot in the rat recipe, which are only made in hydroponics.


[26-Mar-25 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	so players without access to hydroponics and who want to make all the RAT inputs themselves should make BEA.


[26-Mar-25 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Mar-25 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Tail end of the MEA boom and it seems poised to get worse.


[16-Apr-25 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	^


[16-Apr-25 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, look at that, MEA ask just dropped 140 AIC even as I was speaking.


[16-Apr-25 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Hahahah.


[16-Apr-25 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Buckle in, boys.


[16-Apr-25 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	Hmm, I just got here I was a going to build an IVP to go along with my FPs and start producing MTP and MEA...  Is that a bad idea?


[16-Apr-25 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	Well i suspect its all triggered by the planned nerfing of IDC


[16-Apr-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Well, MEA went through the roof, people started spinning up IVPs to take advantage, and then as it started to come down the nerf got announced.


[16-Apr-25 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	So it's kind of a one-two combo that is probably gonna hurt since IVPs have low flexibility.


[16-Apr-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**3-Kids-in-a-Trench-Coat**:	which one is IDC? nerfing because it's too profitable?


[16-Apr-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	IDC is a SCI workforce product that has no inputs and a market maker with a high price to sell into.


[16-Apr-25 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	Ah, I see. Over supply coming + the nerf.  I guess I'll go look up the details on that...


[16-Apr-25 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	So it's spendy to set up operations, a bit spendy to keep them going, but requires next to no logistics and has an assured return.


[16-Apr-25 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Basically they're cutting the MM from 1530 -> 1100 over the course of May.


[16-Apr-25 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	It's still not bad, but it's also not the same degree of money printer that it was.


[16-Apr-25 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I've got one IDC base and I'll probably keep it. I was going to make 3 and the other two are up in the air now.


[16-Apr-25 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I see... Well at least the MM is still okayish. Good heads up to make sure we diversify properly though, so thanks!


[16-Apr-25 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	That's mostly because I already make MEA/WIN and I don't really chase maximized profit, so there's value in it as a low volatility easily fed income stream to me.


[16-Apr-25 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	is the nerf why firefreak quit?


[16-Apr-25 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I haven't heard that FF stated a reason.


[16-Apr-25 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I see, well, thanks for all the info.  Trying to see what the region will need most next to get setup properly


[16-Apr-25 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	FF quit? well that sucks....but that could be part of it seeing as how he built out entire systems of E-bases out in the boonies.


[16-Apr-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	TBQH IVPs are probably the one ag-related building that is even kinda risky.


[16-Apr-25 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	In terms of food processing, FER and FP both have plenty of flexibility and a pretty reasonable universal demand.


[16-Apr-25 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	yeah, when i first started I wanted to head towards KOM and FER but oh the $$ looks so sweet with FIM and MEA lol


[16-Apr-25 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I mean, may still be viable depending on what your expectations are and how the IDC thing shakes out.


[16-Apr-25 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If you're expecting >6K/u for MEA at any volume you may be in for a rough time, but if you're planning for like...4K with anything above being a bonus, I wouldn't be sweating too much.


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Firefreak mentioned in DC that he just got bored


[16-Apr-25 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yes I also expect anything related to IDC production to return to normal, and one of them is MEA. Those who specially built IVPs to take advantage of the high prices should prepare for a much lower price in the coming weeks


[16-Apr-25 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I expect we will see a big drop in MEA demand as well.  I wouldn't encourage plans that count on MTP/MEA prices remaining where they are.


[16-Apr-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	tempted to get out of MEA before it crashes


[16-Apr-25 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i suspect all IVP products will see a sharp decline in prices


[16-Apr-25 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	like VG


[16-Apr-25 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Stonk**:	Here I am, shutting down my RAT base in order to make MTP


[17-Apr-25 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I think I'll make FIM till it crashes and let those with IVPs already make MTP... The question is, where will the veteran players who were investing heavy into IVP start investing now...


[17-Apr-25 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Newly setup IVP bases can easily be demolished and give back most of the construction materials. For players that have the base longer, it is a bigger loss as you don't recover anything anymore from the habitations. So I would think the more recent setup bases will just be demolished again and the older players keep their bases.


[17-Apr-25 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Do we see MEA production in monthly report? That will give a good idea if the production has really scaled up already


[17-Apr-25 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	exactly but, my point was, when those bases get demolished, what is done with the mats?  Whatever industry they go to is probably a good one to get into now


[17-Apr-25 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Morango**:	I don't know enough to answer it myself unfortunately lol


[17-Apr-25 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	all the IVP planets are limited by TEC, so MEA production won't really have gone up too much. Avalon in the last week would have increased MEA production by about 38 units a day.


[17-Apr-25 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I'd keep an eye on ALE prices honestly. All the best MM's need a bunch of TEC jobs.


[17-Apr-25 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	@stonk according to the report production held pretty steady last month, mean of 4445 per day, going up to5367


[17-Apr-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	Over the past three months it appears to have increased by about 100% galaxy wide


[17-Apr-25 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And it's about to come down as people abandon IDC bases

**DeniedClimax**:	^


[17-Apr-25 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	I'm curious to see the people convert off IDC, coming from something so artificially 'economically reliable'


[17-Apr-25 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	People with IDC bases better ask around if someone needs WAI before demolishing. Might as well keep the SL if they are old.


[17-Apr-25 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I haven't crunched the numbers yet, but I'm pretty sure IDC will still be economically reliable...it just won't be quite the money printing machine it was.


[17-Apr-25 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeniedClimax**:	Just wait till the meds run out


[17-Apr-25 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
