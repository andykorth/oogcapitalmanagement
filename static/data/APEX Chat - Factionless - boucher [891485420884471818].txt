**Michionlion**:	Hi all! The latest tax dividend just came in, with a much healthier 20,770 ICA in revenue for the last week.


[26-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	We still need significantly more to stabilize, which is why I proposed a new tax breakdown on UFO. In summary, production fees for all industries would jump to 5 ICA per order, with RE-benefiting industries jumping to 8, and RE to 10. There would still be no LM fees, and the production fees are significantly less than even the minimum possible on in-faction planets.


[26-Sep-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	If anyone has doubts or issues with this proposal, please bring them up! I will be putting these into effect in a few hours, but if there are better solutions out there, they can always be amended.

**Maces**:	LF 3 GRN


[28-Sep-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I am in desperate need of shipping, so if anyone has extra ships around, let me know! I will pay at least 10 / t  for shipping.


[28-Sep-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Anyone that has one NL to sell?


[28-Sep-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Btw folks I think a few here have heard of a little planet called LG-093a, its the planet responsible for quite a bit of the LST reaching Boucher and the ALO that made a lot of the bfabs/lfabs that are supplied here on the market.


[28-Sep-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Anyway, that planet is up in the "Name that planet" vote on the PrUn forum, if it wins it gets a name that will be voted for after


[28-Sep-21 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	Sooo, if you don't have any of the other planets you want to have a name, it would be awesome if you could vote for Lg-093a. Its just fun :)

Name THAT Planet Round 4
I would like to suggest “El Dorado” for LG-093a. Trippel red planet. So hard to get to, but plenty rich with ALO/LST and even GOLD!! ^^

**Desan**:	you will also receive a button with the voted name on it if it wins. SO it could say El Dorado LST for example, what a fashion statement! who wouldn't want that =D


[29-Sep-21 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jazlyn_Keppler**:	I hope we can manufacte these locally ^^


[29-Sep-21 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	yes, all aluminium pins sources fresh from LG-093a, all sustainably harvest.


[29-Sep-21 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	And by sustainably I mean there is just so much that it doesn't matter =D


[29-Sep-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	If you also would like to give the ALO/LST planet that feeds Boucher a name, here is your chance. vote for LG-093a

Name THAT Planet Round 4
I’d like to propose the name Danakil for OT-442b; it’s a region in Ethiopia with sulfur hot springs, and given that OT-442b has both SCR and H20 I think it would be fitting

**OddPotato**:	ah just saw old ads were removed, there was 18k water at 13 avg


[25-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	based on my pricing estimate, if you can buy water for less than 14.7 you can profit by sending it to the cx


[25-Oct-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	but only for a few days before the price crashes

**OddPotato**:	Hello Boucherians,  are you tired of your ship hitting micro meteoroids and chipping hull off and damaging its beautiful paintjob?  are you tired of hearing creaking noises when you land on Cold or High pressure planets?


[22-Nov-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	Fear not! Faram Industries Basic Hull Plates come to your rescue. Made by untrained Settlers without any supervision, they are guaranteed to stop your ship from making creaking sounds and  with a new paint job too.

**Dragonican**:	Some of us at boucher residents have been reflecting on the state of Boucher,  and the tsunami of water we have but are not able to ship. In this reflection, we sought an industry with parity, with heavy inputs but compressed outputs.   Those of us have begun to complement our RIGs with chemistry pieces, and have begun to want for a Chem cogc. The bonus to RIGs is nice, but evidently excessive while shipping remains in this state.  So far weve only talked amongst ourselves, and it'd be rather rude of us to flip the cogc unannounced, so let's have a proper open discussion. Should boucher remain RE CoGC?


[03-Dec-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I mean, i compress all of my H2O into easily shippable DW already. Losing COGC would cause me to need to do some remodeling. =( Maybe even move elsewhere, idk.


[03-Dec-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	imo its best to capitalize on the advantage the planet has. if you have too much H2O, just use less RIGs to get the same output and use the space for something imo


[03-Dec-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	*something else IMO


[03-Dec-21 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	dito


[03-Dec-21 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i agree


[03-Dec-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i find that it is most beneficial to stack your efficiency bonuses on the BUI that take up the majority of space. water is so plentiful on boucher that shipping capacity is reached with a very small number of RIGs. id argue that RE does not consume enough base area to be worth boosting like we are with the COGC


[03-Dec-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I'm of two minds on this, so I'm not going to take sides. I will say that if the CoGC bonus flips, I will change taxes to more heavily tax those who benefit from it, similarly to how we do that now for RE and its related industries.


[03-Dec-21 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	I agree with Dragonican.  Rigs are super efficient already.  RE COCG seems a waste when you can put down 25% more rigs pretty easily.


[03-Dec-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i feel like if your compressing to DW with the fast recipe you can find more value in the RE cogc


[03-Dec-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	id be more amicable to a Pioneer COGC but a whole completely different industry like chem? not sure how i feel about that


[03-Dec-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	fuel would make more sense than chem


[03-Dec-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	i seek a production line that works in tandem with H2O exports; fuel is rather heavy, im seeking something light


[03-Dec-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	so your looking to export PG? what does a base with chem cogc look like for you?


[03-Dec-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	in what metric?


[03-Dec-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	my question is more like , what does boucher have that utilizes a chem cogc


[03-Dec-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	an extreme disparity in import and export volume, would be my first point


[03-Dec-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dragonican**:	boucher's water wealth is cool, but its definitely more than we can handle. i think the way forward is to change the COGC to a different industry, particularly one that can leverage the many empty ships that get sent to Boucher while not putting too much strain on our full ships leaving Boucher


[04-Dec-21 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	There are few reasons I am against RE CoGC  1) Boucher has abundant water because of which H2O/DW price is in gutter.


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
***OddPotato** deleted this message.*


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	2) Boucher is a starter planet where new people settle primarily to extract water or for agri.


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	2a) Agri doesn't need so much water that it would require a RE CoGC since one RIG already makes so much water on          boucher without any bonus it should support agri with a few rigs.


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	2b) If some new player settles for H2O/DW they would not grow because of gutter prices (point 1) and leave the          planet anyway (or even the game) after few days.


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	3) Shipping is always a premium out of Boucher but most ships come to Boucher empty because there is nothing to import.    Boucher would thrive better if there were actual industries that utilize the empty ships to import and increase footfall


[04-Dec-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	4) Just because a planet is good at something doesn't mean it has to do only that if it's hurting the residents of the    planet. Yes you can compress H2O to DW but that doesn't solve the problem in points 1 and 2b it just extends it by a month or two


[04-Dec-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	5) The reasons for why Chem CoGC than RE are below


[04-Dec-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	5a) I would have preferred Agri/Food Industries CoGC but then RAT will be in gutter (extends point 1) and         will be competing directly with Avalon/Promitor


[04-Dec-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	5b) There is no Chem planet in HRT, There are supporting planets to Boucher in neighboring system which export AMM/N, import AMM/N from          next system and H/AMM/N/<any chem input> from HRT to make plastics, NS or <any chem stuff>.


[04-Dec-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	Then there is question of why not Fuel Refining CoGC i don't have answer to that, if somebody wants Fuel Refining they can start voting it.

[04-Dec-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	I don't get the concern about having too much H2O, just use less rigs. If we swapped off RE you are suddenly telling a lot of people to build *more* rigs which, full bases cannot do, forcing us to basically tear down our whole base.


[04-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	It's not really the same telling you to use less rigs as it is telling me to use more rigs.


[04-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	RE cogc Boucher water is among the best, if not the best H2O in the galaxy. thats a good advantage for any industry that uses H2O, which is a lot


[04-Dec-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	yes, I agree it's unfair to ask people to increase the amount of rigs they have.


[04-Dec-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	and I should be the last person to say remove RE CoGC since i benefited a lot due to that when I had 20 RIGs


[04-Dec-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	you could say it's hypocritical.


[04-Dec-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	but the situation was different then, water was above 20 and I was able to grow fast


[04-Dec-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	but now new players cannot get as much value out of it, more over it's hurting them even more if they are not doing Agri on Boucher


[04-Dec-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	for example @Xerwolf is one who is new, you can ask their experience on Boucher

**Gladi099**:	convieniently from your corp


[04-Dec-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	sorry, but this has nothing to do with our corp, we are already split internally on RE CoGC


[04-Dec-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	you can even see the votes if you can't believe it


[04-Dec-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	obviously i talk more with my corp members than outside it, so i might be biased


[04-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	Some one said this to me once when I  was planning to setup 20 RIGs `Cheap water is good for everyone else except for the producer`


[04-Dec-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Hey OddPotato, can you let Watawalos know to check his PrUn convos before doing any Contracts? I accepted one by mistake - didnt read right


[04-Dec-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	I have more water than I need.  The price plummeted


[04-Dec-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	You can vote how you want.  I think Chemistry is the future of the planet.  There's demand for it and just not for water.  The DW margin isnt going to be affected by a lower water production


[04-Dec-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	Myself im trying to produce NS to incentivize HYF use which will make water price go up hopefully as well


[04-Dec-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	already running HYFs - makes most sense with the water and its nice to not have 20 rigsto support HYFs


[04-Dec-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	sure


[04-Dec-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XerWolf**:	I don't know the best path for everyone.  I just dont see RE being that useful long term to growing Boucher into something that can support more than PIO and SET buildings


[04-Dec-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	does it need to?


[04-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	no worries :)


[04-Dec-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	if the goal is HYF, Promitor is right next door with agri COGC and local H2O. However, in order to run a decent number of HYFs off of local Promitor water, you need to use almost all your experts on RE. Which is okay since you still get agri COGC. If you want to use imported water, thats a ship dedicated to trucking H2O full-time. On Boucher, with much better H2O concentration, you instead do the inverse. You dont need to invest nearly as much on RIGs, and instead use experts on Agri, and you end up actually being able fit more HYF with 4-5 agri experts assuming you have the NS to keep up. I don't know why youd want Chem COGC here, I mean i can image people have bases that would benefit from it, but I you'd leave a lot of the planet left out. Agri I could see the logic but IMO if the goal is HYFs (which it should be since local Fertility sucks), RE is just as good as Agri COGC


[04-Dec-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	as it is, Boucher, Promitor and Avalon respectively have RE, Agri and Food Processing COGCs which forms a nice little triangle that a lot of people have set up production chains on. Changing this would cause disruptions for people set up along this chain as well.


[04-Dec-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i get the arguments but the rebuild is too much, if yall are really looking at a nice chem base in HRT. Berthier is pretty good ~there is a HAL/LST supplier 1 jump away and berthier is about to get a COGC + has nitrogen

[24-Dec-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SuperAdi**:	whats this culture and why do i need it?


[30-Dec-21 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	its for the population, they crave culture, at least the higher tier POPs do. We wanted to foster TECHs and ENGs more so we give them what they want so more will come in :)


[30-Dec-21 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SuperAdi**:	ah, i thought you just build a building and the required pop just "poofs" into existence


[30-Dec-21 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	as you first settle, you do poof 200PIOs into existence ^^ but after that you have to cultivate them, woo them so more either migrate in or (in case of higher then PIO POPs) educate up the ladder


[30-Dec-21 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Desan**:	and thats basically why we have governors on planets, to tend to that stuff


[30-Dec-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SuperAdi**:	i see, makes sense now :) also 0% unemployment for the higher ones on our planet, needs that nudge :)

[27-Feb-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	But I'm not completely opposed to that; it would be good for each POP tier to only pay for the upkeep it needs, instead of paying for other tiers as well.

**OddPotato**:	anyone selling O?


[28-Feb-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	Hey everyone, the CoGC is in desperate need of some MCG -- my stockpiles ran dry earlier this week so I can no longer front it, so if anyone has some that they'd be willing to sell to me or donate that would be much appreciated!


[28-Feb-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	I think you have to change your contracts, as he's new and not yet has a rating


[10-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	Oh and thank you for shipping my previous shipping orders


[10-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	oh right ty


[10-Mar-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	1900x5 per ship, should give him a much needed initial boost


[10-Mar-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pokter**:	but the guy I transported most for in the beginning got inactive :/


[10-Mar-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Mar-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**vukos**:	what are you/were you producing out here


[26-Apr-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	just DW and H2O


[26-Apr-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	before this week, i figured H2O was abundant enough on the market that I could just buy it. Didn't expect the new player wave to wipe the market clean and spike the price :D H2O.IC1 It's such an easy base to maintain for me it was silly to ever get rid of it really


[26-Apr-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	please sell me H2O


[26-Apr-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vukos**:	Question about Boucher governance here, are our taxes covering all the Infrastructure upkeep costs or should I be expected to contribute additional stuff


[27-Apr-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Watawalos**:	Usually taxes should cover everything, sometimes governors will auction the materials needed for upkeep so you would get paid for the additional stuff


[27-Apr-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Watawalos**:	SUN for example are only useful for infrastructure upkeep


[27-Apr-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Watawalos**:	Boucher auctions have in the past been held on the UFO discord


[27-Apr-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Pluck**:	im probably looking to stay gov for 1-2 more cycles and then pass the torch. if anyone is interested in a gov role in the future, let me know. im happy to give some simple guidance ive learned as well as help provide "limited" materials for some of the the POPI infrastructure (activity will be declining from staleness)


[13-Jun-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omniphagous**:	Does the governing entity need to be a Corp? Do you have to invest much into infra for maintenance? I'm literally only 9 days into playing this game and I'm not sure my weedy company could take it.


[13-Jun-22 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	have a bit more time playing across 2-3 planets before assuming governor role. it's mostly a nuisance and I don't know of any governor that's profiting in any significant manner from running a planet. it's mostly buying and ship lots of POPI goods


[14-Jun-22 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omniphagous**:	Yeah I definitely wouldn't rush into it, but I don't know anything about governing and whether it's profitable, a money drain, or nicely balanced.

[14-Jun-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	you have two ships, load up the H2O on those and ship them to your nearest CX (HRT for you). When you're there, sell the H2O and buy what you need, put it on your ship and ship it back

**VizoR**:	recommended read


[14-Jun-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArigatoFox**:	Thanks.  I'll look those over.  Quick question before I read the links, when I put H2O up for sale, does the ship carrying the H2O need to be at CX and stay there until it is purchased?


[14-Jun-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	i honestly cant remember, always had warehouses at the CX


[14-Jun-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArigatoFox**:	I noticed you can rent a warehouse.  I'll have to look into that and see if the price is better than buying fuel.


[14-Jun-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	you can ask in the help channel, more ppl there =)


[14-Jun-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArigatoFox**:	ha, good call


[14-Jun-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	sometimes you see something at the CX for a good price and want to buy it but your ship is nowhere near. good idea to have a warehouse at that point


[14-Jun-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pluck**:	if you have a buy order on the CX, you dont need a ship/WAR there at the time it goes through. it will sit as an endless "contract" (waiting to be picked up). having a WAR certainly is cheap and incredibly useful to have 1+ on your common CX, esp once you get going and start selling/buying more and more


[14-Jun-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pluck**:	100 ICA/week/WAR

[14-Jun-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omniphagous**:	I am, but I forgot to take your contract when I departed 12 hours ago D:


[14-Jun-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omniphagous**:	I will probably be sending another ship back in a day or two.


[14-Jun-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	running pioneers is cheap. one full ship of dw/rats supplies my 35 rigs for over 2 months while I need to empty the tanks every 2 days

**ArigatoFox**:	@mmmd Being as noob as I currently am, I'm just trying to get the basics down.  I see all the cool strategies this game involves and it has been exaclty what I've been looking for.  I plan on being more locally active once things get up and running AND when I figure some stuff out.  Once I get some experience, I'll be more open about flights and the like.


[15-Jun-22 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	@ArigatoFox - When I started PrUn I didn't move my ships for maybe two months...which was a missed opportunity. One asset a beginner has is that everyone has two ships...and ONLY two ships. Large enterprises often are fully bottlenecked and need to hire extra ships (aka space truckers). This can earn you some startup funds to build your infrastructure


[15-Jun-22 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Though fuel is cost prohibitive as you begin, a good shipping contract, or a repeat gig that you can work out the returns, is handy.


[15-Jun-22 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	However, getting shipping contracts is a paid account feature, so the alternate argument may be to feel out the game in free mode.


[15-Jun-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	BTW - since resources tend to flow TOWARDS HRT the ships are more often empty heading OUT to Boucher. All shipping contracts have tapered off drastically lately, as have local market (LM) selling, though I'm not sure why.

**ArigatoFox**:	I really wouldn't mind more local market trading, when the price is right.  I noticed some decent deals but most are high enough to walk away.  I've got to get my product going before I can do much.  Each day seems like a "oh, that's how it works....I should have done XYZ instead".

**Assanova**:	Tutorial is neccesary other than that ask questions people help


[16-Jun-22 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	I'd recommend joining the official Discord, you can find a lot of informations there


[16-Jun-22 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Parsing the forums helps too


[16-Jun-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	Ile look into the discord and forums, thanks!


[16-Jun-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	It takes a minimum of time to gather the informations you need, don't get discouraged by it :)


[16-Jun-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	I liked Auroa4x and endlessly complex games so Ile get into it soon enought ;)


[16-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	Just wondering if picking to start in the agri sector was a good choice or not :D


[16-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	I'd advise trying out things for about at least a week to practice, it'll allow you to make some mistakes and get an idea of how the whole thing works, then you can start fresh with the COLIQ command


[16-Jun-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	Agri is good, only one thing in AGRI that is in high demand right now is COF i believe


[16-Jun-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Be advised you can't freely restart your company over time, the first restart is free, but it becomes incremential after that


[16-Jun-22 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	This planet is strong for making coffee but its a bit hard to do so as a new player


[16-Jun-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Yeah COF is through the roof right now, but it's a rather expensive investment for a new player, and I have the feeling it might crash in a short while imo


[16-Jun-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	hmm I don't see Caffinated Beans in the farmstead production tab?


[16-Jun-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	I guess it needs a different building in that base :S


[16-Jun-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	They're grown on HYF


[16-Jun-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Hydroponic Farms


[16-Jun-22 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	Ah yeah, just saw I need hydropnics


[16-Jun-22 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	To give you an idea, I spent about 2-3 days investigating the market, the map, the products, etc. before starting my first business


[16-Jun-22 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Then I restarted my company about a week later


[16-Jun-22 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	After I thought I learned enough to start fresh and pick the right business at the right place


[16-Jun-22 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Things are going smoothly now, and I'm slowly expanding and optimising my revenues


[16-Jun-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	i restarted multiple times in the beginning day or 2 then just went all in, any mistake id just take the hit


[16-Jun-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	I spent so long picking my company name though! :P


[16-Jun-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	You can pick the same name when you restart, but as I pointed out it becomes limited over time


[16-Jun-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	"The first COLIQ becomes available immediately after company creation, the second one 3 days after using the first one. The wait time for the third COLIQ is 21 days, and every following cooldown is 60 days long."


[16-Jun-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	So if you plan on restarting, it's best to first practice a bit before you do it


[16-Jun-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omniphagous**:	I've invested in coffee straight off the bat for the production boost, but I buy beans and make my own for a bit of savings (water here helps).

**Bandyman87**:	I've decided to go pro and started doing regular shipping to Hortus from Boucher, to help boost business for me. Things are going well for my business so far :D, thanks everyone for the advice over the couple of weeks.

**Assanova**:	very nice!


[01-Jul-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bandyman87**:	If a production is stopped at 80% e.g. Rig getting H20, then would I get 80% of the resources made thus far or lose everything?


[01-Jul-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	press cancel once and see what you get back


[01-Jul-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**kerfy**:	could we get the WAR upgraded.. GAL takes a lot of space.. ?


[14-Jul-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkNstein**:	Build a STO for your base? Gets you +5000/5000 (under infrastructure tab of construction)


[14-Jul-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pluck**:	yeah a WAR is a small supplemental storage. We are currently at 2 WAR but if you want more for heavy GAL then build a STO


[14-Jul-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pluck**:	or shipping ads if you dont need it on site

[18-Jul-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	could be because there's often other ads that pay better


[18-Jul-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	also maybe lower your cargo to 300 instead so someone can pick up 2x100 to fill up

[18-Jul-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Orravan**:	You need to supply your farm with water, you can either buy it on the market or pump it with a rig


[18-Aug-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Orravan**:	Issue a new order to your farm in your production line window, if you have the required resources, you'll be able to start growing it


[18-Aug-22 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	@arinrin i know a person who had lots of INC on boucher, the problem is shipping the C out of boucher because shipping C is painful


[18-Aug-22 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	so if you don't have shipping cap, i'd say it's a bit difficult


[18-Aug-22 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arinrin**:	@OddPotato thanks for the input.. since selling raw H2O at CX not as profitable as before might think to venture to other stuff


[18-Aug-22 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**namazu**:	how do ship upgrades work anyway? Can you upgrade a ship without having to replace the whole thing?


[19-Aug-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Watawalos**:	Yes, as long as your new blueprint doesn't need a bigger bridge or more FTL emitters for example.


[19-Aug-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Watawalos**:	You can add an MFL and a WCB to the standard ship and you would only need some extra structural stuff and 1 LFE


[19-Aug-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**namazu**:	nice, I'll have to look up how to do that when I need it

[10-Sep-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	I think I messed up already... :P


[10-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	you need RIG (collect water) and FRM (to grow beans)


[10-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	make sure you build housing for your worker as well


[10-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Ahh, yes I went straight for extractor. I did build ioneer habitation


[10-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	wlel beginner tips, take all fuel from your 2nd ship and sell it at CX


[10-Sep-22 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Oh thank you then I can get mats for an extractor or something with the cash I guess?\


[10-Sep-22 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	that should add more cash for you to able to buy mats and consumables for your worker


[10-Sep-22 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	yes


[10-Sep-22 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Perfect I'll do that as soon as I am back from walkin the dog


[10-Sep-22 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Thanks neighbour :)


[10-Sep-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	fly slowly at CX, should min fuel usage your flight takes around 1 and half day to nearest CX


[10-Sep-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	no rush in this game


[10-Sep-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Hortus station is the nearest?


[10-Sep-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Okay I am going to Hortus, min reactor/fuel usage, 1d3h, 115 STL, 99 FTL fuel consumption


[10-Sep-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	I guess I should use the fuel I am hauling to refill before I sell correct?


[10-Sep-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	looks like you pick up the idea well :)


[10-Sep-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiya**:	make sure you buy consumable (RAT, DW and OVE) before returning back to base. keep some fuel to make few more round trips.


[11-Sep-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Yep I will


[11-Sep-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	I'm confused I seem to have lost like 75% of my workforce overnight


[11-Sep-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	I have 71, where as last night I had 200


[11-Sep-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	Maybe you haven't employed them, after every population report any excess pops you haven't employed will be transferred to planet population pool


[11-Sep-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	A population report is triggered every 7 days


[11-Sep-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Oh that makes sense for them to go where they can be useful.  Does that mean I have to wait 7 days to have them cycled back once I have more work?


[11-Sep-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	*Thanks for answering my questions btw


[11-Sep-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	there is reserve pool, when you are building a building, you can see how many pops you can get immediately in a bracket, any number beyond that number in bracket you have to wait for next POPR


[11-Sep-22 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Okay that actually does make a fair amount of sense. Thanks a bunch

[24-Sep-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	at the current DW prices the break even point where producing DW outstrips H2O is a H2O price of 24


[24-Sep-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	DW has more use than h20


[24-Sep-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	DW is also half the weight/volume of h20


[24-Sep-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Players will encourage you to sell h20 on the cheap to power thier Promitor/Avalon chains


[24-Sep-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	that said, depending on price, you can make more from h20 than DW


[24-Sep-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Current Average price is 32.4 and current lowest ask is 36. take a little off for shipping, if you want to sell locally, I would recommend no lower than 30 p/u


[24-Sep-22 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Huxley936**:	Which is the bid amount at Hortus. I suppose it's well worth just sitting at an asking price of 32-36 and waiting


[24-Sep-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-22 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-22 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tomstachy**:	I will be glad if you could create some smaller h20 buy orders (200-500 units) instead of 1000-2500 so newcomers will be able to gain some bucks easier


[25-Sep-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arinrin**:	if does round estimation daily rig will provide with 87.3 H2O daily each


[25-Sep-22 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Omniphagous**:	Regarding that Ammonia seller, they're not the only producer on the market. They're buying everyone else's Ammonia and then reposting it at their high price. Which is part of the game, I suppose. It just means I get my Ammonia from Moria now.

[03-Oct-22 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Orpheusdeluxe**:	Imma be flying 2 ships here soon - and got rigs and dw production on promitor.... anyone need some for normal/reasonable/slightly cheaper price, to stop you from drying out out here?


[03-Oct-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tomstachy**:	I believe most people posting buy requests for H20 here are doing it to later transfer it to other planets. I believe it is cheaper for them comparing to buying it on commodity center.

**Ari_Fox**:	Bummer...I was super excited to construct my second base this morning.  I did, with intentions of building three extractors so I could get production running.  Buuuuut, I didn't realize every building needs a TSH.


[20-Oct-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ari_Fox**:	I'll have to invest another $80k.  *single tear


[20-Oct-22 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ari_Fox**:	I thought it would be just to build the base.  It will still save me money, I was just jazzed about getting it this morning and not a few days from now.


[20-Oct-22 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ari_Fox**:	That base will only have extractors.  My main base, here on Boucher, has the other buildings to refine the ore and make the prefabs needed to grow.


[20-Oct-22 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OddPotato**:	becareful about pops on new base if the planet is not populated, you'll only get 200 when you start the base, and they'll grow sloowly over the time


[20-Oct-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ari_Fox**:	It's got a pop.  Honestly, all I'll need is 200 for a long while.  I'll be using it to get LST and  FEO to make the prefab materials for more rigs here on Boucher.  Water is my game and it's been profitable.

[27-Jan-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	couple small 'forgot starting inputs' orders on the lm if anyone's inclined.


[27-Jan-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Don’t have any HCP. Did you mean to buy H2O or DW?


[27-Jan-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	H2O to kickstart they HYF. Appreciate it


[27-Jan-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don’t have any HYF’s yet. The welding plants are still banging out the MHL’s back on Prom, lol


[27-Jan-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah they take a bit. Only one WEL on of-375c so it takes 9 days to self make. :(


[27-Jan-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	wait, they're 16..8 days


[27-Jan-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I have 4 welding plants going. They’re just using the area the HYF’s are going to go.

[27-Jan-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And it’s so blessedly cheap on the inputs and so expensive for the product, I’m still going to come out way ahead when I bulldoze and lose 1 of each of the fabs.

[31-Jan-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	is that public or private?


[31-Jan-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No we do not have one here on Boucher. They would turn up in the planet info if there's one, e.g. type PLI VH-331e


[31-Jan-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And they're public


[31-Jan-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically the only reason to have one locally would be for STL ships. You would have to be an absolute raving lunatic to want an STL ship in this system.

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	operated by onlywarez


[31-Jan-23 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	launched 21 hours ago


[31-Jan-23 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	visible on panel PLI FK-794b


[31-Jan-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	unless thats someone elses sship orbiting


[31-Jan-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and they show that on maps


[31-Jan-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh, command SI, it is as ship my bad


[31-Jan-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	neat they show that for other people stuff


[31-Jan-23 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	FK-794B is Boucher


[31-Jan-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and is that not this chats planet?


[31-Jan-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	all planets use a 2 letter 3 number followed by 1 letter combo, the names are what players or devs have given well known ones for various reasons


[31-Jan-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes


[31-Jan-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, shipyards in a system are used to make STL only ships in that system, since once built they can't be moved to a new system


[31-Jan-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the 4 starter CX systems have prebuild shipyards by the devs, a few others were built to make STL only ships in systems before the universe advanced enough to make FTL capable ships


[31-Jan-23 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	STL only ships are a lot cheaper to make, but not the cost of a whole shipyard, someone or a some group of people decided there was enough demand to build a few extras in systems where goods are often shipped within a system


[31-Jan-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I know I considered it in the leadup to ship upgrades for the OF-375 system


[31-Jan-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but the cost of a shipyard is greater than the savings a STL only ship would save me


[31-Jan-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	now, as to any value of other planets in this system, FK-794C is interesting in that it has no resource value, but you could set up a HYF base there for an in system where you mine water here, ship it to that planet, then ship the agri products back to burn, you'd need FRMs on another planet to support 3 recipe C burning (probably Promitor)


[31-Jan-23 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	funnily enough


[31-Jan-23 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i did think about doing just that


[31-Jan-23 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	refining and hydroponic farm on c


[31-Jan-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but then i realized i need to figure out how the population growth works, and draw them in


[31-Jan-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	then deal with the population upkeep on the planet


[31-Jan-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and decidedd, maybe next month, ill just build those 2 buildings here on b

[31-Jan-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	1 person planets aren't that hard, a single safety station should be enough to support your full pioneer population, maybe a partially supported extra building to help maintain settlers


[31-Jan-23 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you want to make the extra planetary buildings (CoCG, admin center, warehouse, and LM(though you really don't need that last one)) there is extra costs


[31-Jan-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, I'd consider it if my next 6 months plus expansion wasn't already booked, I have 3 planets to settle, 2 ships to build, and 2 bases to massively overhaul, 2 more that need minor overhauls


[31-Jan-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	the one thing i know is gonna bite me in the ass is building repairsn


[31-Jan-23 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	do you mean prefabs for repairs, or hull plates for your ships?


[31-Jan-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	nah, im only on day 10 of this attempt; damage is minimal


[31-Jan-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	diidnt even know it existed until i read up on the population upkeep a few days ago and decided to read more of that handbook


[31-Jan-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	there is quite a lot in this game, and i do like that


[31-Jan-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, this is a good 2nd or 3rd planet if you choose Promitor as your first, since new palyers can make their first base anywhere, Promitor is so overcrowded that no player can build a second base on that planet


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah, lack of pvp in this spreadsheet simulator is what drew me to it after i quit eve online about 6 years ago


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, the game does a good job of been complex and deep, but easy enough to access once you've had a couple of days


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	tired of being contested for land, so to speak,


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but yeah; not being able to clear land on a full planet, when you cant tell whether anyones active or not


[31-Jan-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	especially moreso with this extremely small playerbase :|


[01-Feb-23 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, this planet is probably gonna see a boom in people soon, since water prices skyrocketed a few weeks ago when someone started manipulating the markets for it


[01-Feb-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is some auto clearing, free accounts, that have never paid, get deleted if they go too long without activity, and while that time goes up the longer they play, it's still possible


[01-Feb-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thats good to know


[01-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on the other hand, the devs don't delete accounts that have paid a t least once, even if they go inactive for months, this causes problems on the most popular planets, since they probably have a full set of paid accounts on them at this point (mostly Promitor, the other starter planets aren't nearly as bad)


[01-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	im... not incensed, that almost everything is locked behind a paid account; i can definitely see the reason, but it feels like too much


[01-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	that is, until i actually read and saw that unpaid from paid accounts keep half the unlocks when they turn into 'basic'


[01-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thats tempting me to actually pay for at least a month


[01-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	as a "new player" aka day 30 and 5 attempts earning money at the beginning is HAAARD


[01-Feb-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, and some people do that, or plan to and like the features they would lose so much they keep paying *cough*me*cough*


[01-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, the start of the game is slow, a pro account can let you earn money through shipping contracts to speed things up


[01-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yes, thats whats tempting when i see 30-40k contracts to haul shit to hortus, when i have to make a trip every 4 days or so, to earn 1/20th that


[01-Feb-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, it's why I got one on day 5, haven't looked back


[01-Feb-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	If anyone else needs anything shipped in from HRT, speak now. Ship is departing HRT in about 12.5 hours, flight time should be approximately 1 day even. Expect to have 400/400 of free space, give or take a fuzz depending on my personal needs...but if you're very close I can just adjust my own bring. I make the round trip every 48 hours.


[01-Feb-23 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you don't mind picking it up from Promitor, I can fill that cargo hold up


[01-Feb-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	or actually, never mind, I have a different one from HRT itself to be delivered


[01-Feb-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	what is the rate from HRT to Boucher?


[01-Feb-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

***Zuul** deleted this message.*


[01-Feb-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Got it, I'll pick up the package right before I ship out. HRT storage is usually stuffed to the gills since I use it as a hub for 3 routes serviced by independent haulers.


[01-Feb-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same, I'm arranging a bunch of shipping from MOR to HRT that will then head onto Boucher, so I can probably fill any cargo holds heading out to Boucher in the near future


[01-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	does anyone know if theres a way to transfer inventory from ship to ship in space?


[01-Feb-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	aka, ship has the ftl fuel to make one leg of the trip to middle of nowhere, but not the fuel for the return trip?


[01-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	only when landed on a planet or at a station


[01-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	else the ships, even if in same orbit of a planet, are not at the same point in space


[01-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	you need to land somewhere, planet or station


[01-Feb-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	even if its a barren planet, with no bases, or any real infrastructure?


[01-Feb-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I think so, since even barren planets have a basic population infrastructure setup, even if it does nothing cause nothing is built there


[01-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	you need to land


[01-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	you dont need a base or anything


[01-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	but you need to land


[01-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so your ships are in the same location


[01-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	they are not in the same location when you are just in orbit


[01-Feb-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I know people that settled the outer rim (Hubar) did that to fly out there, they landed at a planet part way, then used extra fuel stored in their cargo holds to refuel, then carried on


[01-Feb-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	for refueling the ship from its own cargo hold, you do not need to land


[01-Feb-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	only when moving cargo from one ship to another


[02-Feb-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah end result has that 5 short on pioneers


[03-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, refinery, yeah, HB2 then =)


[03-Feb-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Run an HBB on con planet though. I do prefer them for the space


[03-Feb-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oof, it's the con base that has the 5 short on pioneers not here.


[03-Feb-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	1075/1080 man they eat too much too


[03-Feb-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’m actually thinking about doing a bit of a survey in a 3-4 jump range. Growing here just isn’t that efficient, and having Prom produce carbon burning mats really puts a strain on the ability to run the upper tier foods out of there. So I’m going to try and look for any system nearby with limestone that isn’t a disaster and any kind of worthless planet that is 3 in the green. Doubt I’ll find one, but it’d really help turn Boucher into a C furnace if we had a nearby HYF world with local NS support.


[03-Feb-23 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	you got the construction production to make hyf? its like 10 days just to make enough lamps for 1 with 1 welder


[03-Feb-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	A close by planet that could produce the fast recipe would be nice but just 4:13 produces 83/day maxed


[03-Feb-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	3 WEL currently but dropping two to rebuild three PP2 shortly


[03-Feb-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	4 myself back on Prom. Not sure what I’m up to back there right now. Somewhere between 70 and 80 MHLs


[03-Feb-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, I’m not farming at all out here and just planning to run 8 incinerators on 2 input from Prom production. That’s like 79 per day or something like that.


[03-Feb-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ship coming out is mostly empty, so I’m just putting a few extra HYFs on Prom where they can abuse the extra experts and CoGC


[03-Feb-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I was overly optimistic. Only 66 MHLs in stock right now lol


[03-Feb-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That works! Prom's running C as well but only about 50/day. when adding the SF and extra H2O and GAL from here, this is almost twice the profits as Prom

**Zuul**:	Ah, my Prom is all food right now until I swap over. RAT’s rats and more rats. I was going to go up to like 2k rats per day, but that would require another permit on Avalon….so instead I’m adding a few more HYFs then I planned, tossing in an Orchard, keeping RATs about 1200 a day, adding some higher end food products to the menu and shipping the rest down here to burn for C.


[03-Feb-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well….food and welding plants, lol. Those are sitting in the spot originally filled with RIGs that was going to be used for HYF’s. So I put the welding plants that would build the HYF’s where the HYFs will fit at the end.


[03-Feb-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice. I'm sticking to one permit per base for now. Prom makes it's own rat/dw and provides all the ove I need for the three and some excess. Makes some PE for con base when it builds up etc.


[03-Feb-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, my Prom is 3 permits. It’s such a good agriculture world, and everything else nearby is so not….


[03-Feb-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think I have 23 FRMs there right now, lol. Will be 17 or 18 after I add in my HYF’s and ORC.


[03-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol damn. I have 9 and might drop the RAT/DW for a 10th and 5th INC but would only gain like 2k/day for the hassle of buying/transporting RAT/DW


[03-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I want to replace a lot of farms with HYFs but I know I'm about to start producing MHFs in the coming weeks so def worth the wait lol. Slapping down 2 more bases in the next 2 weeks


[03-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	MHL


[03-Feb-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	*


[03-Feb-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Man you're expanding fast. Been running mostly off Prom profits for all three bases :/ finally starting to get excess fabs to sell though.


[03-Feb-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Best move I made was maxing out a base on OF-375c for Bfabs. Easy expansion


[03-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Aye, very happy with that choice as well. Just annoyed with the PE prices and can't afford to maintain the Lfabs yet xD


[03-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, I'm seriously now toying with the idea of a HYF planet to supply the carbon industry here. AJ-293A. It's not used for anything, it's not very far away (under a day with minimum FTL), all 3 are in the green....and 1 system over is Dulcet Diggers madhouse high temp limestone base where he keeps the LM loaded with LST.


[03-Feb-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So you'd only need to import N from HRT, then run water when you go between BOU and the NS/HYF on the new rock.


[03-Feb-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And as a trade route people could run N from HRT, ag goods to BOU, and H2O and C back to HRT.


[03-Feb-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I doubt I'd attempt it solo before I lay down another 2 or 3 bases....but it's a thought.


[03-Feb-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Actually, isn't Toktu around here somewhere? I think there's a dozen people there or so, and that's a N motherlode. Might be able to just LM import direct from them.


[03-Feb-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Not a bad idea at all. Im not at a computer right now so I can't look .. easily... but I wonder if there is a planet in the same system as boucher for the same idea thats cheap to settle resource wise


[03-Feb-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	An HYF planet that is


[03-Feb-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Boucher has no triple greens, and flying intra-system in Boucher will shred your ships due to the heavy MM presence.


[03-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	C is just low temp....so you'd only have to go with some insulation, but you'd still get ripped up delivering product, and you'd also have to fly LST AND N in at distance, so the logistics would get a bit more complicated.


[03-Feb-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's a pity E is 2 in the red or it might make a candidate with the trace LST deposit.


[03-Feb-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Gotcha gotcha


[03-Feb-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, yeah, FK-037 is where Toktu is. 1 system out. So you could probably LM import N from a resident there on the cheap to save them the trip to market.


[03-Feb-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I get all my LST from JS-572c. Jeff sells it Very cheap on the LM there in bulk.  I pick up 1k at a time


[03-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah.. once Boucher is done it's save for ship upgrades time. Can't put it off any longer.


[03-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, JS-572c IS dirt cheap for LST.


[03-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That being said, AJ-946a is cheap too compared to market, and it's only 1 jump out from my potential site.


[03-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Oh yeah very worth it especially that glass engine STL for HRT system if you go that route


[03-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Sadly all three bases are in different systems so no STL ships for me


[03-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Very true I didn't even know the AJ one existed


[03-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I didn't either until I bought one of his listings on Prom and he told me I could get as much as I wanted at AJ, lol


[03-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I use STL ship for Prom Avalon HRT station and soon Helion Prime


[03-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What are you installing on Prime?


[03-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	And upgraded both starters after that


[03-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Chem base


[03-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I was thinking of going there too...but not sure now after Griffon.


[03-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I meant what chem thing specifically =)


[03-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	hopefully PG so he can sell me cheap mats on OF-375c


[03-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Lmfao I have it all planned out in PRuner but I'm not home so can't tell you specifics lol


[03-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	bur yeah def PG


[03-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	and a lot of it lol


[03-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yayz cause Lfabs are expensive to make.


[03-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	PG isn't chemicals, is it?


[03-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, yeah it is, duh


[03-Feb-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I was thinking about making some PG out at Griffon. I'm already making EPO by the truck load....so PG just means importing a bit of MG, I'm already bringing in C/H/O


[03-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I'm trying to slap down a chem base there and a manufacturing base on Nova Honshu within the same week. Just been saving up mats and storing them until I have everything I need to slap at least 3/4th full bases at both spots at around the same time


[03-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I'm getting anxious cause then I can really expand my construction and advanced construction after that


[03-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	but will def not be settling another base for a while after that. Just advancing and moving things on what I have


[03-Feb-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Changing things around on what I will currently have **


[03-Feb-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice. Similar plans but much slower progress. Haven't decided on the chem/manu bases yet and dunno if I want berthier for ship parts first or not


[03-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I wish I went chem and manu before berthier tbh


[03-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	but whatever same end result


[03-Feb-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	And I wouldn't say much quicker. Just have 100 more days lol


[03-Feb-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Make sure you upgrade ships and maybe build a 3rd at some point tho makes it easy


[03-Feb-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol yeah that 100 days might help a bit. yeah LHP is gonna be as soon as boucher is done then I'll start saving for a third.


[03-Feb-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Probably gonna do berthier before I expand storage though cause yeah that's expensive to buy


[03-Feb-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZhivGaming**:	anyone coming back from ANT I have two shipping offers up on ANT LM.


[03-Feb-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you want to progress past Lfabs and set up well for future Rfabs, get EPO production at your chem base as well, fairly easy in the HRT system as HAL usually sells fairly cheaply there, when it's not sold out


[03-Feb-23 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the fact you use basically the same buildings, just need a few extra imports on a PG chem base


[03-Feb-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Good advise. I'll throw some of that into pruner before the set up as well if I didn't already can't remember


[03-Feb-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And that's why Griffonstone is so pretty. Halfway decent HAL on a 3 green. Makes it a clearinghouse for CL and EPO bases. So the only thing you bring in extra is MG. You can even toss in a LAB if you need DDT and it's the same stuff as EPO, so no new imports.


[03-Feb-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I think the recent influx of chem bases on Griffonstone has removed a large source of HALs on the markets


[03-Feb-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm looking at my stockpile dwindling :(


[03-Feb-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I assume so as well. While Hortus has some sources....they're not good ones.


[03-Feb-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	they're terrible


[03-Feb-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Can only hope that the HAL supply stabilises over time


[03-Feb-23 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Unless someone opens up a new extraction planet and ships it....I doubt it. Nothing is going to flow off Griffon anymore that's not refined EPO. It's why I'm going ahead and adding DDT production there too since I don't expect HAL or CL to be widely available outside it for awhile.


[04-Feb-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's actually one of the few things OZ-189A is good at, cause HRT always had cheap HAL compared to BEN and ANT which are closer to griffonstone so should be cheap there


[04-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	OZ-189A is not good for anything else, so the people that set up there set up resource taps only, allowing bulk production close to HRT where it's offloaded


[04-Feb-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	looks like vault is best HAL planet but there are no 'great' hal planets at all


[04-Feb-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	YI-705c second best HAL in the game


[04-Feb-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	only need INS to settle it, bit out of the way though...


[04-Feb-23 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is 20 per day per ext, can fit a lot of them on a single base


[04-Feb-23 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	YK-005d is fairly close to ANT, and again, only INS to settle


[04-Feb-23 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Only downside being if you don't have 3K/1K ships yet....have fun hauling the output.


[04-Feb-23 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	i'm too blind to find that one. how's it compare to gc-645b? all greens, still low hal but everywhere seems to be


[04-Feb-23 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just type PLI and the planet


[04-Feb-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	17/d/ext


[04-Feb-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So PLI YK-005d


[04-Feb-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	slightly more hal but low temp


[04-Feb-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	and that cli could be useful..


[04-Feb-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the second one is 17.8 per day, the best in game is 20.39 per day, Vault is 16.99, OZ-189A is 15.44 per day, griffonstone is 11.53 per day


[04-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	promitor, a bad soruce is 3.5 per day


[04-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You need some capital for OZ-198a due to the high temp


[04-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don't know if "bad" is an adequately terrible enough term, lol


[04-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	depends on the resource, different ones have different rates


[04-Feb-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch


[04-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I use this to search most of the time


[04-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and just compare how fill the bar is, the closer to max, the better it is compared to the best in the game


[04-Feb-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when looking for resources, I have all planets open (all conditions), then decide if the resource is worth the extra cost of the extra building materials (answer is usually no)


[04-Feb-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I change how I order it depending on what I'm after, eg, close to a particular CX, how good it is, etc


[04-Feb-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I usually filter for best first, find where a few that I might consider are, based on location, then look near where I actually want it and compare the resource to see if the extra is worth it


[04-Feb-23 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	480 t/497m3 of available space preparing to depart HRT for BOU. If you want anything shipped in, I'm holding for 30 minutes past this post.


[04-Feb-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	Kinda lucked into a real good start as a new player here on boucher huh. Chose fuel refiner and there's all those tasty shipping contracts to ship my fuel by side with. I'll be running mostly empty on the way back though so feel free to put some shipping orders back to boucher on hortus station if you'd like.


[04-Feb-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@Vornoxem when will your ship be returning from HRT to Boucher?


[04-Feb-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	@--SCHAITR-- monday probably, but I am shipping some base parts too so it would need to be split up loads


[04-Feb-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How much space will be available, and what's your ETA on Boucher


[04-Feb-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	sorry, not entirely sure yet, im still deciding on my next base upgrade. I'm considering my first FRM just to get rations out of my shipping needs. I am really green at this so I would not factor my off the cuff planning into any plans you have just yet.


[04-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	Shipping is the most profitable thing i can do at the moment though, so i should probably just make that my thing for now


[04-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	not much else to do either, dont have capital to trade with


[04-Feb-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	ok do post something if you have space available


[04-Feb-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR looking decent. We've had some increase in TEC employment but there's a still some buffer. Will be continuing with PF3.


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, Boucher has fertility, I didn't even see that, I only looked at it from the perspective that it's got great water


[04-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, Boucher is actually a stupidly amazing world. The fert is "technically" negative, but it's not that negative.


[04-Feb-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	^^^ this


[04-Feb-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	especially with experts


[04-Feb-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's good as a refinery planet because of the Galerite. Great for farming because of the extreme water and fert. Good for just plain extraction because of the water. Great for carbon because of the RE focus and fert and water.


[04-Feb-23 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If you're running HYF the fert doesn't impact and yes I love this planet


[04-Feb-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deejanky**:	Stupid question: How do I refuel my ship? I have fuel at base but can't figure out what to do next


[04-Feb-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In your fleet panel, click the fuel button instead of the cargo button.


[04-Feb-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Then drag the fuel into the fuel bay you opened up


[04-Feb-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deejanky**:	Thanks!


[04-Feb-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well crap. Like the 1 night none of my regular shippers are around and I can't beat anyone new out of the shrubs even with a good offer, lol

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh, is someone propositioning?


[04-Feb-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I.....what?


[05-Feb-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	youre looking for shippers?


[05-Feb-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	has anyone experimented with ship designs, running the simulator on the varying engine types doesnt seem to actually produce any sort of  fuel or time savings


[05-Feb-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if your using slow burns, it won't have much of an effect, if your using the powerful engines, you'll want high G seats otherwise your acceleration is capped


[05-Feb-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's also mostly to counter the weight of very heavy things. Like advanced plates....they're stupidly heavy. Need a beefier engine to move them in the first place. That being said.....it's really hard to find any legitimate build that you'd really get any kind of benefit from them unless you like tearing about and pouring thousands of fuel down the drain per flight.


[05-Feb-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I guilt a fast ship fr hualing between planets in the same system, much faster than starter and uses less fuel. Fuel saving STL, medium cargo bay, lightweight hull plate, advanced high-g seats. Intersystem I've not found a blueprint that significantly speeds that up without buring a lot of fuel.

**bazdakka**:	I've filled them for now, lucky I try and keep over a weeks worth of every consumable in stock for my own use


[07-Feb-23 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm small enough on settlers still that that was 10 days. Thank you!


[07-Feb-23 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not as bad as me a few weeks ago, full new base, forgot pioneer consumables, luckily I had a second ship at the CX to quickly buy what I needed


[07-Feb-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oof


[07-Feb-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I learned the hard way, always have a spare ship at the CX when your setting up a new base if you can, or at least on it's way to the nearest CX, makes fixing these stuff ups a lot easier, it was a much smaller planet as well, so not as large of a group to pull from for emergency filling LM orders


[07-Feb-23 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah that's fair. Someday I'll have a spare ship xD as it is I can barely keep up.


[07-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, looking at your current bases, you'll be fairly close to your limit right now if I don't miss my guess, since Boucher shipping water with a starter ship is almost a full time job for 1 ship


[07-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I'm pretty much constantly sending back and forth between both boucher and adalina. Now and then I get to stop by prom lmfao


[07-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I suggest taking some time in the near future to look up ship blueprints and figure out what you want, , a glass ship is a no go for you sine you don't have 2 bases in HRT system, so it'll either be a new ship, or a ship upgrade, the upgrade will probably be cheaper and get you more in the short term, I'd help out, but I've got to head off for a couple of hours


[07-Feb-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Appreciate the info! I'm thinking LHP is next and maybe a med storage


[07-Feb-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Prioritize storage. Hull plates as an upgrade are fantastic for ships working a single system. Not much good for FTL. STL speed and fuel is ship + cargo mass. FTL is ship volume. So saving weight doesn't do a whole lot for FTL travel.


[07-Feb-23 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	makes sense


[08-Feb-23 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	for cargo hold, I am a firm believer that WCB is the best upgrade, since it's same size crew quarters (which is a big cost increase), and large FTL fuel tank and medium STL fuel tank, since that is the biggest you can go without increasing crew quarters, I left hull plates the same since you don't get a refund on anything and it's extra cost that you don't need to spend, yes, over time, you will save money compared to BHP, since while you need to repair more often, the decreased cost per repair is worth it


[08-Feb-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	of course, if your going for a new ship, I would say a large cargo bay is better again, since the medium crew quarters isn't much more expensive than a small crew quarters, but your starter ships already have a small one, and from tiny to small is where the big price jump is


[08-Feb-23 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Depends what you’re hauling. If you’re hauling DW, or H2O, or anything else that has an equal volume to mass ratio, or greater volume…..the medium cargo bay is objectively better. You’ll make better time and save fuel compared to a WCB equipped ship.


[08-Feb-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That requires that you have enough shipping volume of that type of good to keep the ship permanently loaded though. If you ever go to move limestone, you’ll be kicking yourself for not having a WCB.


[08-Feb-23 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd recommend the WCB to give yourself more flexibility. You're not going to be hauling DW/H2O forever


[08-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	of RAT even, you can haul more RAT in a WCB, or any metal, and most ores as well are better in a WCB than a medium, basically anything that is heavier than it's volume is better in a WCB than a medium, though sometimes not by much, and anything over double it's weight compared to volume is better in a WCB than a large (given I know he is on Adalina (new name for OF-375C) and he'll be importing LST once he has a better ship, I suggest the WCB hands down, though it is a rather expensive upgrade I'll admit, it's still cheaper than a new ship


[08-Feb-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it'll double as a medium well enough that it's worth the extra fuel on all trips (at least in my opinion), and the same can't be said the other way around, when you eventually get a new ship and get one with a large cargo bay, it can take over the routes it's better for


[08-Feb-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**gatoratlaw**:	i put up an emergency add to buy FF, would appreciate the help


[08-Feb-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Filled


[08-Feb-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For me it’s more that, for the holy Boucher, Promitor, Avalon triangle…..short of investing in an actual large ship, medium is the best cargo bay of choice. Water is equal mass to volume, agriculture goods are greater volume than mass, and while rations are almost double mass compared to volume, they are also LESS mass than the agriculture goods that went into them. Which means unless you’re deliberately dropping off agriculture goods and leaving the rations behind, you’ll never need more mass for the rats then you did for the ag, and the ag is volume heavy. So for that particular route (which is a full workload), a medium cargo is objectively better than a WCB. Now that’s not to say you don’t want a WCB, but only saying that there are full workload routes that are objectively better with a medium than a WCB.


[08-Feb-23 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I plan on one WCB and one Med for the starters and will see what ship three needs when I can afford to think about numbers that high. Just not sure which one to build first. Probably the med tbh


[08-Feb-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you’re only going to do 1 ship upgrade….I’d probably concur with going WCB for the versatility.


[08-Feb-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I need a WCB for the metalwork I do. Probably do the med first to help get everything running smoother though since it's a cheaper start.


[08-Feb-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Can't even pull a full stack (100) LST in a starter it makes me sad.


[08-Feb-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Yeah I went wcbs on both starters when I upgraded and don't regret it one bit. They're great for what I do


[08-Feb-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	yeah noma pulling 1k limestone a trip is fantastic


[08-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	especially at those prices.. those cx rates scare me.


[08-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Exactly


[08-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’ll be doing a medium, but also a WCB, and I’ll be doing the WCB first.


[08-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so to build ships, or even upgrade them


[08-Feb-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	I can do that anywhere so long as I have the mats?


[08-Feb-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	*pulls up documentation*


[08-Feb-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	No you need to go to a shipyard


[08-Feb-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	go t it


[08-Feb-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	VH-331e has a shipyard


[08-Feb-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so yay!


[08-Feb-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Yessirrr


[08-Feb-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and if I read this right


[08-Feb-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	"The ship’s blueprint needs to match the origin blueprint of the project."


[08-Feb-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	means you cant upgrade the starter ships since the originating blueprint is locked


[08-Feb-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No.


[08-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You set a origin blueprint and a target blueprint.


[08-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The origin blueprint needs to match the ship you're upgrading.


[08-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The target, does not....or it wouldn't be much of an upgrade.


[08-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The target blueprint need not be built off of the origin blueprint.


[08-Feb-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	now the real question is, does it factor in repair state on calculating the cost of the 'upgrade project'


[08-Feb-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, because upgrading doesn't repair the ship.


[08-Feb-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So if you go in at 82% and completely change the ship...it's still at 82%.


[08-Feb-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yay documentation


[08-Feb-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	many thanks for answering inane questions


[08-Feb-23 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not a problem


[08-Feb-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	now to do the math to see which is cheaper: new base for fuel refining on planet c, or upgrading a ship


[08-Feb-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If Boucher ever starts having enough people burn carbon that imports actually become a thing to run the incinerators....The second they do we won't be hurting for H2O export anymore. That's why I put up a couple feeler packs of HCP, see if there's any demand at all, lol


[08-Feb-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm building BMPs on Adalina until I can get a manu base going to bypass the cost of PE, so if you want to keep hiking the price of C, be my guest :)


[08-Feb-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	burn carbon here having the meaning of burning plants to MAKE carbon, lol


[08-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I got you, I have 6 INC so far but no way on man's browning earth am I paying 250 for HCP xD but I also have HYFs..


[08-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	But lemme know if people start paying that cause maybe I'll redo prom.


[08-Feb-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Up in Moria those lunatics are paying 350. Even in Hortus the price keeps hitting up into the 250 range.


[08-Feb-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	At 500 for C It's way less worth it but I don't run on imported inputs so maybe I just don't see it.


[08-Feb-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That's only double profits which on C is like eww


[08-Feb-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Moria C is selling for 750 if that tells you anything =)


[08-Feb-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I need a third ship before other markets can take my time still. Can't afford to send a ship that far to sell.


[08-Feb-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ship it. I still sell product in Moria semi-frequently. Haven't had a ship up there in a couple weeks.


[08-Feb-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The price up there is almost always so stupidly high it pays for the transport, the currency exchange, and STILL gives a hefty margin over selling in Hortus.


[08-Feb-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah that's fair I suppose. I've only ever shipped one package. Been trying my damnedest to maintain my own infra.


[08-Feb-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	But probably not the most profit-driven plan.


[08-Feb-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm not going to bother doing exact math right now, because I'm tired as all get out. But we'll say you get about 220 C in even a starter ship. With Moria paying a 200-250 credit premium for C, that's a minimum of 44K in extra currency. Even if you lose 10% on the currency exchange (and I don't think it's quite that bad right now), you're up 20-25K or so even after paying your shipper.


[08-Feb-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Feb-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you're talking about this system, 794-C, the reason why not is because it's low temp...so you're going to have elevated construction and repair costs, and the hydrogen yield is absolutely god awful.

[11-Feb-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	this one is also good


[11-Feb-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thank you


[11-Feb-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and yeah, 1.68/day is not... good


[11-Feb-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	was hoping at least 3


[11-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	3 Would still be horribad


[11-Feb-23 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	true, but if i can manufacture all the needed foodstuffs for the pioneers, and have it only run that; thats still eenough to make the 1 cycle of 100 FF/ day, which is more that enough for the one leg from here to hortus, and the ship takes one day there one day back, so thats 2 runs, so fuel is free-ish :P


[11-Feb-23 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	using those 2 sites is part of how I plan bases, I usually use them together, then check the planet in game, depends what I'm looking for at the time


[11-Feb-23 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Except that, unless you're running something really outlandish in Boucher, you could just bring back half a dozen pieces of H for next to nothing on your return trip.


[11-Feb-23 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which would be orders of magnitude cheaper than setting up a terrible H extraction planet to run 1 cycle in a refinery =P


[11-Feb-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	eg, a while ago I was looking for a place with a chem CoCG, and used fio to filter to planets to need a CoCG, then looked for one with a chem CoCG, then I checked it's location, other resources, then I use PRUNner (don't have a link for that, but it's in the community resources of the handbook) to plan out a base that does everything I want it to


[11-Feb-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah, which is currently what im doing, bringing TS H and AMM, and processing it here for SF and FF and absotulely loads cheaper than buying the final product ( as it should be )


[11-Feb-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	just wanted to see if it could go cheaper :P


[11-Feb-23 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as Zuul says, your ships here are often flying back from HRT (or one of the planets in system) anyway, if they are flying empty, or mostly empty, you can easily pick up spare H on the way, lets you fly cargo both ways, and use your fuel tank as a secondary cargo hold for fuel if that is your plan


[11-Feb-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ill eventually have that much money to do so :)


[11-Feb-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	TS is a poor use of REF time, your better off just buying HE3


[11-Feb-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not if the CX prices didn't make a major change. I'd check but my screen is literally covered in buffers right now. Last time I checked in HRT HE3 was up to 1K on the ask side


[11-Feb-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	useful trick, find the planets near where you want it that supply the material, and see if they have a LM, them rent a warehouse there so you can use said LM to buy the materials cheaper than CX (not always possible, but worth a try)


[11-Feb-23 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you "really" want to set up an FF production, and you don't mind low temp and higher costs in general....AJ-293g


[11-Feb-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Good hydrogen yield and HE3 on tap instead of TS.


[11-Feb-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But it's a GG with low temp, so not a super cheap set up.


[11-Feb-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	O-o raw he3 via extractor O_O


[11-Feb-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that and if you are buying on the CX, try using buy orders, place one before you arrive at just above the current offer price, see if someone fills the order before you arrive


[11-Feb-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There are multiple worlds with HE3 on tap directly.


[11-Feb-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	TS is the pre GG route. Don't think off the top of my head there is raw HE3 on rocky planets, although I could be wrong


[11-Feb-23 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	VH-043e is good for HE3


[11-Feb-23 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	and not related at all, but I just got an exploration contract for..... Berthier!


[11-Feb-23 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It is good. Much better HE3 yield, but not built in H.


[11-Feb-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	What I gamed out in my head on making a fuel industry was VH-043e for HE3, then the main refinery base on Odysseus


[11-Feb-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as said above, but I'll clarify, TS is a way to make HE3 without access to gas giants in the early universe, since the game has gone on long enough now, access to gas giants isn't limited anymore, and people can easily set up bases on them if they want to, the TS was simply a temporary solution to the problem


[11-Feb-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	With GALs from Boucher


[11-Feb-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I was spitting out AJ because he was trying to supply refineries on Boucher instead of in Hortus, and AJ is a 1 stop ship for FF inputs and closer to Boucher


[11-Feb-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So....more of a "best case" for a scenario I don't recommend anyhow =)


[11-Feb-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	erm, 1 stop shop


[11-Feb-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, though it's not a bad short term plan, though it would require complete disassemble afterwards, since long term it's not worth it


[11-Feb-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Schaitr has a better long term plan, but it requires setting up 2 bases, though you would easily become one of the larger local fuel producers doing so


[11-Feb-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, the more specialized each base, the better, but the more logistics it requires, eventually you reach a point of such diminishing returns to the point it's not worth it


[11-Feb-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah i feel that bit trying to plan stuff out


[11-Feb-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and I don't think even the oldest players can have a base on a planet with amazing yield of every resource, plus another planet to process everything, the trick is knowing where the cut off point is


[11-Feb-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Anyone need anything shipped from HRT to here? 500/500 available. Would prefer to leave within the next hour or so.


[11-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I have some stuff to ship here, let me figure out the price and put the ads up


[11-Feb-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	is 2 day shipping ok? some of them are consumables I'm running low on


[11-Feb-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there, 3 ads up for a full cargo hold


[11-Feb-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the ads are at the Boucher LM


[11-Feb-23 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Should be less than two days


[11-Feb-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	be here in 23.5. Cheers


[12-Feb-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	all good, I ran into a problem with my consumables, wasn't paying enough attention during a shortage in my own production, now I have 2 bases running low and my ships poorly placed to supply both, I did the other one first since production here is less important


[12-Feb-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that and I just purchased just enough H to finish filling the cargo hold


[12-Feb-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so your advertising a ship out to here was very good timing


[12-Feb-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Awesome! Always glad to help. I was set to deadhead out so it works perfectly.


[12-Feb-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, mostly I can transport my own goods, I just stuffed up my logistics again, the fact this is a recurring event means my logistics chain is overly complex, at least for me to handle

**MoonSugarTravels**:	I'm flying in tomorrow so I could bring you some, but looks like you're on a free license and you need pro/basic to make direct contracts or use LM ads.


[14-Feb-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	hey Zuul are those water contracts dire or just future stockpile?


[14-Feb-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i ask as i have 700 units available


[14-Feb-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They are just there for anyone who wants to dump water due to a lack of transport or something of that nature.


[14-Feb-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you have water you want to sell at that price in a smaller quantity, I’m more than happy to cut a direct contract for whatever amount.


[14-Feb-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	✔ gotcha

**thadaeous**:	Hello I just setup a base on Boucher to produce water


[15-Feb-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I need to process that water into something needed on BOU  any suggestions


[15-Feb-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I am currently producing DW


[15-Feb-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	DW is fine,, a lot of people here ship it back to Promitor where they run FRMs or HYFs, or to Avalon where they run FPs


[15-Feb-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Boucher is often used purely as a resource tap, with minimal processing done on the planet


[15-Feb-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though it's often not a second planet due to that, resource taps tend to require bigger empires to fully use, though 2 planet's isn't unheard of, just less common


[15-Feb-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	Ok  I understand ...


[15-Feb-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	so we will need larger ships to transfer the cargo


[15-Feb-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	I still don't understand why Boucher is a starter planet, rigs are expensive to build compared to farms


[15-Feb-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	then it's a day to ship to hrt


[15-Feb-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	I actually started on Boucher originally


[15-Feb-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	then I COLIQed and picked Prom as my starter


[15-Feb-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I have Rigs on Promitor and Boucher  - Production of H2O,  is faster on Boucher


[15-Feb-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	ignoring the fact that Promitor is right next to HRT so shipping is a breeze, but farms are like 1/4 of the cost of rigs and require 3x the space so a full farm base is like 400k while a full rig base is like 1 mil


[15-Feb-23 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is a good question, and I don't know the answer


[15-Feb-23 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	ya and that's not even factoring in ghost plots either


[15-Feb-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that might actually explain it, ghost plots didn't use to be a thing, so Promitor was always full, this meant that a second nearly as good planet was needed nearby


[15-Feb-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	ghost plots ?


[15-Feb-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	planets can be full


[15-Feb-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	but if you start on that planet you always get a plot


[15-Feb-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	ah


[15-Feb-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	so right now Promitor is full and has about 300 ghost plots


[15-Feb-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	so the only way to get a base on Prom is to start there


[15-Feb-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I started on Prom and have 745/750 used area and 1 permit left


[15-Feb-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	but permits are only good for 250 area that is why I also started a base on BOU  I got 500 area


[15-Feb-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, before ghost plots, there had to be an open plot to build a base somewhere, even for new players, problem was starter planets were so popular that everyone was building their second and third bases on them, and they were constantly fill, so new players could start on nice easy planets, with steam release approaching, the devs knew this couldn't stand, so added the ghost plot feature where a new player can start their first base on any planet, even if it's full, but second and third bases needed open plots as normal


[15-Feb-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when a normal plot opens up, a ghost plot drops down to fill the slot, Promitor is now so fill that is unlikely to ever have normal open plots ever again


[15-Feb-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	location  location   location


[15-Feb-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the fact that both here and Avalon haven't filled up yet is actually quite surprising, I think it is part of the signs of player turnover, and how few actually stick with the game long term once they realize how slow things happen


[15-Feb-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	Yes  if you are not use to long term games it can be quite a shock


[15-Feb-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	well there's also people grabbing Prom, realizing agri is low margins and moving on to something else like Berthier and OF


[15-Feb-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I started with pbm then ebm so long term is the only way to go


[15-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	those 2 planets barely 60 people each, and a suspect quite a few those people are on both planets


[15-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	right, but as an example, people also move to other systems


[15-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that's true


[15-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	I know people with a Prom base and then the rest of their bases are in ANT


[15-Feb-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	I think what happened was FOMO


[15-Feb-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	as soon as people hear about the ghost plots they make a prom base even if they don't really intend to follow up with Avalon and Bouch


[15-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	my buddies 2nd base after Prom was Hydron


[15-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	he didn't even want to do agri, he wanted to do fuel from the start


[15-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	possible, Promitor by itself can support quite the food industry, even if your not stacking bonuses using Avalon as well


[15-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	but as soon as he heard about the ghost plots he COLIQed


[15-Feb-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	yup, one prom base can fill a few avalon bases right?


[15-Feb-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	well, depends on what your doing I guess


[15-Feb-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ablabla**:	if your running HYF and trying to do COF I guess you need like 2 Prom bases for 1 Avalon right?


[15-Feb-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Avalon is a lot faster than Promitor can keep up with, unless your running heavy HYFs, Promitor can't keep up with it


[15-Feb-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	what I mean though is even if like starting players, you have your FP on Promitor, you can support quite a few other bases from just Promitor


[15-Feb-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Going back, I would also say that Boucher makes a great carbon base. You get boosted water and INC rates and decent fertility for growing ingredients.


[15-Feb-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I almost like it just as much as Prom as a starter, if it weren’t for the fact you can move here later but not Prom. Frankly, since most serious agriculture operations eventually go HYF, the fertility issue matters even less…..and then it’s basically Promitor with a lot more water and a good GAL deposit.


[15-Feb-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	anyone need anything shipped out? Heading asap with a bit over 400/400.


[15-Feb-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	400/400 available*


[15-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	@Zuul I built my second base here purely for the soil and RE bonus, to make carbon for my metallurgy operation.


[15-Feb-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Boucher great for C. Set to make more than I do on prom.


[15-Feb-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Noma your ship still on Boucher?


[15-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	looks like theyre offline


[15-Feb-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yep. Anyway, put up 3 ads for shipment if anyone's interested


[15-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so do all y'all big players manu your fuel to haul your stuff yourselves, or just contract the hauling out?


[15-Feb-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I do both, though I've stopped producing fuel for now


[15-Feb-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	heres another question uniquely suited to you schaitr;


[15-Feb-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	whats the point of creating a corporation? besides the wiki defifiniton of being able to make an hq for a 10% prod bonus on a planet in the middle of nowhere


[15-Feb-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Mine's a one-man Corp and is meant to channel the taxes I collect here to me


[15-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Production taxes are collected by the designated Corp, not the individual, so Govs have to do this if they want to collect the taxes


[15-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Otherwise... not much point creating one as they don't do much (for now)


[15-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ah, so separated coffers


[15-Feb-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Besides the 10% corp HQ bonus you pointed out


[15-Feb-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thanks


[15-Feb-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which, depending on what you are doing with it, can be amazing. By itself it's not huge, but bonuses are, I believe, multiplicative.


[15-Feb-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So an extra 10% is actually a lot more than 10% if it's somewhere already boosted to the nines.


[15-Feb-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh yeah i can imagine, a cogc, with its 25% plus your hq for a 10% on top of that


[15-Feb-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	especially since that 10% is technically free


[15-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think the total efficiency once my 5th expert rolls out on Griffon will be 176% or something like that.


[15-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Now you just have to change your faction to get the uber boost


[15-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can technically get even higher than that if you have a positive fertility world outside the starting planets, since fertility is an entire extra category that multiplicatively boosts.


[15-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But that's exclusive to agriculture.


[15-Feb-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I guess I could....hmmmm, which one is chem again?


[15-Feb-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	No faction is a chem boost. So, here :)


[15-Feb-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's....tempting, lol


[15-Feb-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Aww man why not


[15-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That would end up being an extra 3 and a half percent or so.


[15-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Oh wait I misread Moon's comment


[15-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I thought they meant none of them are chem boosts lol


[15-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Haha, no, no faction is chem, fuel refining, and resource extraction.


[15-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Haha yeah I didn't phrase it all that well


[15-Feb-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but, we get chem, fuel and resource extrat bonuses here?


[15-Feb-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	or am i misreading something


[15-Feb-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, because Boucher is no faction


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ah, i see that


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically, you get it EVERYWHERE, if your HQ is here


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The HQ screen shows you the bonus


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	With 5 exps, cogc, corp and hq you would be getting 180.1% efficiency. Pretty neat


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's a lot of EPO


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's a lot of CL needed too ;)


[15-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I already spit out 1200 every 14 hours and 35 minutes


[15-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, having lots of unused permits increases the faction (or non faction) bonus you get, it's not a good idea, since it's based on unused permits divided by total permits, so to do this right, you need a single base with only 1 permit, as soon as you use that second permits you half the bonus, but it's a funny idea


[15-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hence why I just added another permit and added self-contained CL


[15-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	that's a good sustainable approach


[15-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	less logistics nightmares


[15-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I'd say upgrading a HQ just to get a ~1% bonus is... an interesting way to spend resources.


[15-Feb-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So I just need to import C and water from here, and H and O from....well, anywhere, lol


[15-Feb-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Upgrading HQ for the bonuses is only worth it at the very first upgrade when every little bit helps


[15-Feb-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	After that, concentrating on maximising experts and CoGC bonuses give more benefits


[15-Feb-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	6 BBH, 4 BDE, 4 BSE, 2 BTA, 4 TRU - I'd rather spend those on another SME honestly.


[15-Feb-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	That's much more help than an every little bit from the HQ bonus.


[15-Feb-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I think it's 3% per level, but point remains valid, it's why I said it wasn't a good idea


[15-Feb-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm just point out that it's possible, and to be fair, it's not that profitable anyway, since actually buying inputs is the larger part of production chains, this only speeds them up so the consumable cost is nearly 0


[15-Feb-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, buying if your buying, or the opportunity cost if your making them yourself, but point remains valid


[15-Feb-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it's not just that it speeds them up and reduces the consumable cost. It also significantly boosts profits per day above and beyond any consumable savings by simple fact of producing more of a profitable item. Or I may have misunderstood what you just said, lol


[15-Feb-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not that that makes boosting via HQ a good idea outside of properly allocating the "freebie" 2 or 3% you get anyhow.


[15-Feb-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	problem is it also means you need more inputs for the production line, but yes, problem is, the amount gained from lots of HQ levels is so small that you get more profit from just putting down another base


[15-Feb-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	It's not 3% per level. It's a multiplier over the base bonus (e.g. 2% chem here, 3% agri at Insitor etc) that ranges from 1 (when all permits are used) to 3 (when infinite permits are available).


[15-Feb-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	So, yeah, exactly what you said right above :)


[15-Feb-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's based on base amount with another stack for unsed permits vs used permits, I forget how the equation is laid out correctly, but when you upgrade, the boost it shows on the HQ screen is based on the fact that you got another permit, not that you upgraded the HQ, so when you then use that permit, it drops back down


[15-Feb-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Multiplier = 3-2*used/total


[15-Feb-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	That division is where the diminishing returns come from.


[15-Feb-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that's right, there is also a base amount for having that faction HQ, so it's more =(3*used/total)+3


[15-Feb-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Ummm... no?


[15-Feb-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Say your faction has a 3% bonus to something. You have 2 permits, used two. Multiplier is 3-2*2/2 = 1x. Bonus is 1x3%=3%.

[15-Feb-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, there we go, that is the best way of putting it


[15-Feb-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Now you added a permit. Multiplier is now 3-2*2/3 = 1.67, so bonus is 1.67*3% = 5%.


[15-Feb-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can tell I'm a math nut when I actually start getting twitchy when someone types out a math equation and does not put the parenthesis where they belong! lol


[15-Feb-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Readability is also important :P


[15-Feb-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough, I'm just very tired, and trying to explain something that has a specific way it should be mentioned


[15-Feb-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Indeed....for example, did you just type out 3 minus 2 times two thirds, or 3 minus 2 times 2 divided by 3. Readability! (Yes, I know what you mean, lol)

[15-Feb-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	There's only one way to read "3-2*2/3". No ambiguity here.


[15-Feb-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, that would have save me a lot of time, it was mostly to explain how a poor but funny idea works anyway, so me putting it badly doesn't really hurt it much


[15-Feb-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	@Gladi Yeah I basically analyzed the formula from fnar :)


[15-Feb-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Yeah yeah we understand each other now. Maybe someone overhearing us got mildly educated haha


[15-Feb-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, the amount I learned about this game just following conversations like this when I was new


[15-Feb-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's only 1 proper way to read it, yes....but everyone I deal with in real life is mildly dingy. If I don't put parenthesis around the thing that's supposed to be done first, I never get the right answer back.


[15-Feb-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's what I get for being in a tool shop, lol


[15-Feb-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Hypothesis: this community is in general less "dingy" than that :P


[15-Feb-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I actually work with a guy who can not read a tape measure. I mean....really? Care to guess what his job was?


[15-Feb-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Senior Tape Measurer Specialist


[15-Feb-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	lol


[15-Feb-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lmfao, I'm going to create that job title now.


[15-Feb-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No....he got put on one of the "easy" jobs. Cutting wood to length at a saw.


[15-Feb-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	given you know this and are complaining about it, I'm guessing something that uses one a lot


[15-Feb-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Dude must've had some really good eye then.


[15-Feb-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, everything was completely fucked. 3 hours of product in the dumpster.


[15-Feb-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	xD


[15-Feb-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Although that is NOT the dumbest thing I have seen at my place of employment


[15-Feb-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, when I've been looking at one long enough, or done the same set of 10 measurements that are accurate to within 5mm, my eyes start to crosseyed and it's easy to make a mistake


[15-Feb-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm worried for you now @Zuul


[15-Feb-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	This isn't a few mm, guy couldn't tell an inch and 11/32 from 3 inches. Like...couldn't read it, AT ALL


[15-Feb-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Ahhhh inches. 11/32 lmao what is that even, I hope you made it up cause that number made me chuckle more than the rest of the story ;D


[15-Feb-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eleven 32nds of an inch. =)


[15-Feb-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I get what you are saying, and in my case, it's the repetition of different measurements that does it, while remembering a fold order for the machine, and been very careful to not lose a finger (one of our other branches has 2 people that lost the ends of their fingers)


[15-Feb-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Sorry Baz, i misworded. I meant heading 'out here' not 'out from here'. If your adds are up when I arrive I'll snag for the return though.


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	32nds. That's not even a power of 2, what the fuck xD


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	wasn't me that asked


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Oh wait it is


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I'm going to sleep


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Guy can't read a tape and I'm over futzing with my micrometers trying to hold a half a thousandth on a manual mill for some stop blocks.


[15-Feb-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oh that was Schaitr. my bad for both of ya then.


[15-Feb-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	As far as injuries go, worst I've ever seen was a set up load a die into the press and forget to remove the rubber wedge he had used to hold the die open while servicing it. Cycled the press, launched the wedge out like a rocket, and put a softball sized hole through his chest. Fun day.


[15-Feb-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, we just need to be within 2mm


[15-Feb-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I....need a converted for mm, all I know off the top of my head is that 1mm is right around 3 thousandths, I think, lol


[15-Feb-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I had that wrong, 1 tenth of a mm


[15-Feb-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My brain goes fuzzy when I'm trying to think of press shut height adjustments, lol


[15-Feb-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because, god help me, everything we do is in inches but THAT's in mm


[15-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So for metric using people, I was having to hold to within .0127 mm. Whee, lol


[15-Feb-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ok, you win the worst work injuries story, ours was at another branch, guy was wearing gloves, got the end caught in the folder as it came down, pulled his hand away and the end of his finger was a bloody mess, when they got him to the hospital, they asked where the rest of his finger was... still stock in the machine, they couldn't even tell it was shorter than it should be ask they took him to the hospital...


[15-Feb-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not fun.


[15-Feb-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I like death and bodily disfigurement 'Not' being part of my job.


[15-Feb-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Reminds me of someone who thought it would be a great idea to clean a set of glue rollers while they were running because it was faster to do it that way then separating them and spinning them by hand.


[15-Feb-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Got both hands caught. Didn't take off any digits, but ripped off all the skin on both arms to the elbows.


[15-Feb-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	no, it was an older style machine that didn't have and could have attached the new safety features that this type of machine now comes with


[15-Feb-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, that and a previous job, someone cutting wire that didn't know how wire behaved, without safety goggles, only a few mm from losing an eye, heard about that one a couple of days later, though that guy was a walking health and safety hazard


[15-Feb-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'll be honest. Not even sure what a "folder" is. Just have saws, mills, lathes, machining centers, and presses at the current job. That and tooling, we build a lot of dies.


[15-Feb-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ow, yeah. Those are bad. I can't count the number of times I yelled at someone cutting banding loose from a bundle of steel with no safety glasses. That stuff springs.


[15-Feb-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, and some really, really big surface grinders


[15-Feb-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	this was cutting it out from where it was used to hold trees, so it had been pulled tight


[15-Feb-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You wouldn't catch me anywhere near that without glasses, gloves, and a cutter with a 3 foot handle....minimum.


[15-Feb-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a folder is used to fold long sheets of thin metal into a specific shape, so ours is a 8 m long clamp that comes down on the metal to hold it in place at high pressure, then an apron under it comes up, putting a sharp bend in it


[15-Feb-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh....is that kind of like what they use to mold gutters to size?


[15-Feb-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, we can make box gutters using a folder


[15-Feb-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Gotcha, I'm with you now.


[15-Feb-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, literally nothing you want to get caught in. Those things are wicked.


[15-Feb-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	my dad has better stories, he used to work as the electrician at a meat factory, he was walking past one of the bins at the end of a line and saw someone digging thought it, he asked what they were looking for, they replied their finger...


[15-Feb-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	most of the butchers there were missing at least 1 finger...


[15-Feb-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Now all I can think of is down periscope. "Yesterday, I found a bandaid in my food Buckman!, Today, a fingernail!" "Sorry sir, the band-aid was holding on the fingernail."


[15-Feb-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	haha, I remember that


[15-Feb-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	anyway, I think we should probably stop telling stories about work injuries before we get in trouble


[15-Feb-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, they fit the setting. It's a planet full of oil derricks pumping water and giant industrial furnaces.


[15-Feb-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I mean, yeah... but I suspect a few people don't want to read these kinds of stories and might complain


[15-Feb-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	They can just close this window lol


[15-Feb-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	This the most I've seen on Boucher chat since.. I joined


[15-Feb-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Fine...I won't tell any stories about the guy who put his hand on the back of the forklift rollcage like a dunce and then backed into a raised lift table. Everything worked out find there and not at all grusomely =)


[15-Feb-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	erm, fine


[15-Feb-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Worst anyone gets hurt in my industry is a back sprain from lifting a tower wrong.


[15-Feb-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Thankfully, I haven't really seen much of ANY horrific injuries where I work now. Same kinds of machines, but much fewer complete dee de dee's


[15-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Worst actual injury here was me slipping on the ice a few years back and catching my arm on the hood of a car in the lot...hard. 3 weeks of laying around and just over 2 months of physical therapy to fix the shoulder.


[15-Feb-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	rip


[15-Feb-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm just glad I haven't witnessed any myself, I've had them happen at the company I work at, either in other departments, so we hear about it at the next break, other shifts, same thing, next meeting, or other branches, so next day


[15-Feb-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	worst was me twisting my ankle where paved concrete meets gravel and there is a bit of a drop, that was just the next day then weekend off


[15-Feb-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My old man nearly died in one of those shops many, many years ago. Was servicing a machine in a union shop, the person who was supposed to be running the machine felt it was taking "too long". So they took a pair of bolt cutters, cut off the lock out device, and turned it on while he was still inside. They didn't even get fired for it because the company didn't want to go to battle with the union over it.


[15-Feb-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hence, the fact we now have our OWN factory, lol. Not going to work for anything like that ever again.


[15-Feb-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that's bad, tampering with a lock out that isn't yours here is basically an instant firing here these days


[15-Feb-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I'd hope things are different now days. This was....30 years ago maybe?


[15-Feb-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	nah, they're worse


[15-Feb-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, good one for me, was exposed to asbestos dust when I temped at a moving company, they didn't even tell us the building had it and that was why we were pulling everything out for storage elsewhere, and some of the tall things we had to move had dust rain down on us... problem is as a temp, working for a sub contractor, under a contractor, under the university where this happened... lets just say my complaint about possible exposure to asbestos dust was ignored, this was about 7 years ago


[15-Feb-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, if I get lung cancer, I'll know what caused it


[15-Feb-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	mmmm maybe you can answer this


[15-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ive done something stupidi


[15-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and started reading the forums :P


[15-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and i came up on a post by lowstrife and read a line that disturbed me from a dev reply


[15-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	something about "once we stop resetting the universe"....


[15-Feb-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	how... often does that happen


[15-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Long time. Whenever something major is added that needs a reset


[15-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Last one was over 2 years ago


[15-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so not every 'release' aka this one 'apex'


[15-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	awesome, good to know!


[15-Feb-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thadaeous**:	Being in farming area lost of fingers, hands, arms, and legs is part of the job.  :-(


[16-Feb-23 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	farming is one of the most dangerous professions


[16-Feb-23 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, this is a farming area as well. Seen some bad ones over the years. One kid fell off the trailer while stacking hay bales and got run over. Not fatal….just bad. Worst are when people go play around in the fields during harvest time….

**Zuul**:	See the Galaxy! Verdant Provisions is proud to present it’s new “Around the Galaxy” tour! (This is where I’d put some humorous text, but work says I can’t spend 20 minutes typing.) Have a massive shipping route coming up for a run. Boucher to Griffonstone, griffon to ANT, ANT to MOR, MOR to HRT, HRT to Griffonstone, Griffon to HRT, and finally HRT back to Boucher. Pay is 70k ICA. If you’re interested DM me. I’ll respond after work. Priority will be given to those who have previously completed shipping work for me. Route is not time sensitive, if you are currently carrying one of my cargoes and want the job, I can hold it for 2 to 3 days.

**--SCHAITR--**:	I think you missed out Arclight and Hubur ;)


[16-Feb-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And Benten.


[16-Feb-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They’re all filthy over there. You don’t want to see them on a Galaxy tour.


[16-Feb-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thadaeous**:	I will accept your see the Galaxy Tour - I am 21h out  :-)


[16-Feb-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	There we go. 13 INC down. Time to start adding more ext/rig. almost time for next


[16-Feb-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And did I misremember or did you just get Planet tier?


[16-Feb-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	13 INC? How much plants are you burning in there O_O


[16-Feb-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	heh yeah forgot the mats for a hb1.. will get it next cycle


[16-Feb-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah got planet yesterday. pretty worth.


[16-Feb-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Moon, I have 4 HYF to feed them


[16-Feb-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	So you're burning HCP and MAI in that 16h cycle?


[16-Feb-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Planned for 5 RE experts and 1 Agg so until then it's just producing extra HCP. Might bring up some of my extra GRN/MAI from prom now and then in the meantime.


[16-Feb-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	and i guess it was this am not yesterday. man it's been a long day.


[16-Feb-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I never considered HYF for feeding INCs. Figured since you can't make GRN there, FRM is bound to be more efficient (since I can feed INCs on the fastest cycle, and build less INCs for the same effect). Was I wrong?


[16-Feb-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	It depends. I run the fast cycle on Prom and the slow cycle here.


[16-Feb-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Fast cycle costs less to set up but slow cycle with FRM wins out on larger bases due to area.


[16-Feb-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	slow cycle with HYF seems to be the winner though, just takes more to set up (MHL pricey) and a ton of H2O/NS + settler mats


[16-Feb-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Yeah MHL and settlers upkeep... I didn't even bother. Maybe I'll calculate that when I'm super bored. Until then, I'll go with FRMs until they can't keep up with my C demands on Berthier.


[16-Feb-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah fair. C is still my main sales item since most of my fabs get used so had to ramp up. Prom wasn't supporting Adalina well enough anymore.


[16-Feb-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	currently make about 85 HCP and turn 64 of it into C each day here so it has Prom beat by about 25% or so on C and still has a refinery and another 123 area to fill up with ext and rig


[16-Feb-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	when experts are maxxed out and I get habs lined up again.. cough cough.. the daily C should be just about the same as the HCP


[16-Feb-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’m making 36 per day with my 2 INC’s….so many INCs, lol


[16-Feb-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically it’s probably more like 37, but I don’t feel like being that accurate without pruner or a piece of notebook paper, lol


[16-Feb-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah planned it based on self sufficiency for the inputs and 100 Settlers. 4HYF feeds 13INC maxxed out. Wanted a REF so the rest just came from there.


[16-Feb-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i feel you on those MHLs, i was thinking of throwing up a WEL just to manu them, then disassemble it to use its parts for housing


[16-Feb-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Def worth to make your own.


[16-Feb-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	52/d on prom with 4 INC but they take 8 FRM to feed them. Total area is 340. the 4HFY/13INC total area is 272 - inc habs for both


[16-Feb-23 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
***N0ma13** deleted this message.*


[16-Feb-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	61% more C, 20% less area. I can type i promise


[16-Feb-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	See, my process is just going to be to set up for triple recipe 125 C per day output. I already run a ship from here with a 2 day round trip. It’s always empty on the inbound leg. 125 C means 500 m3 import every 2 days. With 5 experts and a CoGC up on Prom, you get about 50% more output per HYF compared to here. So it’s very compact if you have the transport available.


[16-Feb-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ah those ever important words


[16-Feb-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	"you require additional ships"


[16-Feb-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, yes, make your own MHLs. I used to have 4 welding plants going on prom until the PE and Bfab crunch. Now I have 2 and a BMP and a PP1.


[16-Feb-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sitting on 116 MHLs right now waiting for HYF construction.


[16-Feb-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And yeah….more ships. I’m getting close to deciding “fuck it” and doing build and tear downs to slowly work through making a new ship. I need one and not sure waiting on a builder is going to cut it, lol


[16-Feb-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I haven't looked at replacing FRM with HYF on Prom yet. Trying to stick to the dirt where it can be found but maybe. Prom is probably the least useful planet I have now. Boucher will produce as much as both the other two combined in daily profit


[16-Feb-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I’m going to keep maybe half a dozen FRMs purely for GRN and HER. Nothing else


[16-Feb-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Thinking Nova Honshu is not going to be full bore manu though. I'll throw down some BMPs and a weaver or two but probably going to drop some PG production as well and maybe start on some ship parts while I prep the next split


[16-Feb-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm working on the parts of ship construction, for glass ships I'm about 70% of the way there, I do 80% items, but the last 20% items require the most buildings to make


[16-Feb-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I have most of the easy stuff down pat, but the hard parts are where all the backlogs are


[16-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For now I just need cargo upgrades, so not needing any fancy bits other than the FTL emitter for a WCB upgrade.


[16-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, that large emitter was the hardest part to source when I was doing it


[16-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	There's a few on the cx if you wanna pay 330k -_-


[16-Feb-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Think I’d rather drop an ASM, make my own blasted WAL and stockpile some for future shipbuilding then make my own damn emitters. It’s not like I don’t have EPO coming out my ears for Rfabs.


[16-Feb-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Will def have an ASM on metal planet. Much of the glass chain can be done with same cogc bonus


[16-Feb-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What's the low pressure building mat?


[16-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	SEA


[16-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, ok, that's not so bad


[16-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It looked horrible until I realized it was area x 1 instead of area x 10 like that OTHER thing that shall not be mentioned


[16-Feb-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol! yeah SEA isn't bad. Cheap to make too if you already BMPs


[16-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	wow those prices went up though. I had a bunch for sale but decided to just store them for use.


[16-Feb-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Might go ahead and throw a base down on Berthier next week, and chase it with one for Adalina the week after.


[16-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Adalina is a homie. I keep putting Berthier off but since I'ma hybrid the next one, I think Berthier will follow.


[16-Feb-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so what im hearing is, ppl here on boucher will pay for ship parts


[16-Feb-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	@zuul delivery in 6 hrs


[16-Feb-23 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, everyone wants ship parts, it's just they are very hard to make and very very very very expensive


[16-Feb-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a starter ship is worth roughly 3 million, the cheapest ship you can build is worth 600k, a upgrade kit for starter ships is worth about 1.2 million, and a new ship with large cargo bay is roughly 6 million


[16-Feb-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the higher numbers give a hint about the difficulty of producing some of the parts that go into them


[16-Feb-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why entire corps work towards the goal of making ships, currently, no one person can make ships


[16-Feb-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	even my plan requires I buy certain materials off the market


[16-Feb-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ship construction is considered one of the major end game goals right now


[16-Feb-23 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I just want that 1m equity xD then I'll dump all my cash probably.


[16-Feb-23 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Might not be a bad idea to go through the chain and see what's missing if you have the potential to create new bases readily.


[16-Feb-23 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I would not say an upgrade kit for a starter ship is anything close to 1.2 million. Even piecing it out on the market puts a WCB upgrade at about 700-750k


[16-Feb-23 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The rest is definitely spot on though. New ships are ungodly expensive.


[16-Feb-23 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	too be fair, that one is me quoting someone else


[16-Feb-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	WCB, 350k 6 on the market now, LFE, 280k-400k depending on CX, medium ftl tank is 200k, or large is 325-375k medium STL tank 100-135k, the other bits and pieces of an upgrade kit are small cheap things, so the big ticket items come out at around a million


[16-Feb-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so 1.2 million for a upgrade to a WCB, medium stl tank, large ftl tank, isn't fairly close


[16-Feb-23 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	those CX prices are really inflated


[16-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Wouldn't go for them unless it's a dire emergency


[16-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	imho, the best starting upgrade for a ship would be one of the seats


[16-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	I still have my spreadsheets from when I upgraded my starters to WCB Large FTL etc and it was about 1.1 mill


[16-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	seats don't do a lot unless you fly fast


[16-Feb-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That’s a lot of extra bits and bobs though. A straight WCB upgrade is just the WCB, LFE, and a few plates and structural bits


[16-Feb-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	with all those pieces, it puts a starter upgrade kit to a WCB, larger fuel tanks and the needed extra LFE, plates, and SSC at around 1.1 to 1.2 million


[16-Feb-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	or fly at the wrong time with 80-150k km to get to the jump out point :(


[16-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	Yup thats exactly what both mine cost to upgrade when i did


[16-Feb-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so my earlier statement regarding costs is accurate, you could cut out a few extras and bring the price down to 700k for just the WCB


[16-Feb-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though the larger fuel tanks are nice


[16-Feb-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, that’s a WCB upgrade. You’re doing the cargo bay and the fuel tanks. Unless you’re planning on spelunking to Arclight or Hubur, you don’t really “need” the extra FTL. Rather hold that off for a brand new build and save the small fortune on extra upgrades.


[16-Feb-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough


[16-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I found they are worth it, since it makes it easier to add a bit of speed to trips and not worry about fuel


[16-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	plus my fuel production here is filling my base up, I use the extra space in the tanks to help ship some of the fuel out


[16-Feb-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	in this case, it's just we have different opinions of what a upgrade kit should be


[16-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**supergary**:	Or would it be better to gather it elsewhere?


[17-Feb-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	The extraction would be excruciatingly slow. Way better to just buy it off the CX at this point. Look for another planet and check exact extraction rates here: https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch

[17-Feb-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	nah I'm not shut down, just have to resynch the HYF once the new rig is up. Have 104 HCP backstock so won't run out but appreciated sir


[17-Feb-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	hmm that's exactly two cycles of backstock. I love when numbers do tricks.


[17-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Now that I'm burning locally, I'm just hopeful I can manage to get my Prom HYF's up before I run my HCP backstock dry


[17-Feb-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Need to do a HYF calc for prom. She's my least useful planet now but she got me here so I can't hate.


[17-Feb-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's hugely effective. With the CoGC and a full set of experts, it's about 50% more output than putting them up somewhere non specialized.


[17-Feb-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	hmm I'll have to do the calcs I suppose. Should be having a lot more extra bfabs in the next few weeks

[18-Feb-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I make water....lots of water. And Carbon. But I grow none of the plants here. Export water, import plants. Incinerate, and pay someone to ship my carbon off to get smashed into EPO...also not here


[18-Feb-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	When I have another ship I may think about doing that but I tend to keep as much self-sufficiency as possible still. Prom makes it's own everything but luxury and H. Adalina makes it's own FE. Boucher grows it's own HCP.


[18-Feb-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I hope to never actually buy water.


[18-Feb-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it's an absolute no brainer. You have an iron ore source on construction, with a aluminum source on metallurgy sitting right on top of each other. There should be a mass of back and forth shipping going on to exploit that. And since the planets are right on top of each other, even a shit tier glass ship can ply that route in a few hours without excessive fuel burn.


[18-Feb-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oi wtf. Just ran the numbers and decided I'ma switch prom to produce HER and FIM. There is zero DDT on the market so that's not happening.


[18-Feb-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, literally minimum burn right now is 4 hours and change for a glass LHP ship


[18-Feb-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I was saying that the other day. HER looks pretty....good luck securing a DDT source with all the galaxies chlorine being consumed by EPO.


[18-Feb-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I added a permit and vertically integrated CL production at my EPO base because of it.


[18-Feb-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	My problem with Berthier is that it's a 1:1 EXT/SME for the AL and to make enough to support Adalina will impact the ship buildings I wanted. I think I need a different ALO source but still going to Berthier for metallurgy


[18-Feb-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	probably gonna need next base first then. splitting manu and ... 'everything else I need right now' on it.


[18-Feb-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Look at Adalina with the smelters making FE instead of just AL.


[18-Feb-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	need a lot of FE for bfabs


[18-Feb-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Erm, I'm sorry. Berthier.


[18-Feb-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I would guess most SME on berthier is running AL but I don't know


[18-Feb-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically you'll be removing the SME's from Adalina and moving them to Berthier, because you'd then be shipping the FEO off of Adalina to Berthier to exploit the extra metallurgy bonus.


[18-Feb-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	the ALO is so low..


[18-Feb-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nah most of the space goes to the other metallurgy buildings


[18-Feb-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	berthier is a ship builder planet


[18-Feb-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean...it's a metallurgy planet. That can be a lot of things.


[18-Feb-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	i mean, for me anyway. others do as they do idk


[18-Feb-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Regardless, if you make fabs, I assume you have your PPx's over on Adalina for the construction CoGC?


[18-Feb-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	On Adalina 2 EXT:7 SME can run 5 PP1. There's room for 3 PP2 and either a WEL or STO or you can do other builds ofc


[18-Feb-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	aye for sure


[18-Feb-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Do keep in mind if you had a glass ship you could export most of that smelting industry offworld to Berthier.


[18-Feb-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I keep putting Berthier off though. I will likely recalc each base multiple times as new bases are added


[18-Feb-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it's all theoretical unless a few people get together and smack out a shipyard in the system. But I'd think it'd be well worth it.


[18-Feb-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Berthier was supposed to be base 3. Now it's slated for 5.


[18-Feb-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah a glass ship would be good when both are lined up, you are not wrong. I'm sure most would benefit that use those planets.


[18-Feb-23 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nap253**:	It would be nice for sure


[18-Feb-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, in a theoretical future where there's a shipyard in the system and I can cram an STL ship in there....I'm looking at 6 EXT and 12 SME on Berthier with a daily ALO import need of 25 units from outside (not terrible). Then that would provide enough FE and AL to run 8 PP1's and 4 PP2's on Adalina with 2 EXT's for FEO to Berthier. STO's on both and 56 left over area on Adalina for WPL's or whatever else you want (although I'd rather have those on a dedicated manufacturing world.)


[18-Feb-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Now I want there to be a shipyard there yesterday, lol


[18-Feb-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Actually, that could be a PP3 and the hab space for the Techs....although I don't know what I'd want to do with the remaining 11 area, if anything, lol


[18-Feb-23 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Seeing 830t per day as an import need is a "wee" bit horrifying, but less so when you consider the import source is a couple hours away


[18-Feb-23 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and man, your ramblings last night make me want a shipyard more :(


[18-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, shipyard there. Shipyard here would be about as useful as lipstick on a pig


[18-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	hey, we shouldnt kink shame here :P


[18-Feb-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	you never know who might find that useful


[18-Feb-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but i Do eventually want to at least find a planet to start manufacturing some components


[18-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I tried to encourage a shipyard in that system, problem is it's micro meteors is above average, not as bad as this system, but enough that I've shredded a few ship hulls with the amount of goods you need to transport in the past


[18-Feb-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	.064% is the reported damage per trip. It shouldn’t be terribly bad.


[18-Feb-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	plus, the goods you ship there are really unbalanced, really heavy, so to move much, you need to make quite a lot of trips


[18-Feb-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Roughly 300 trips and change per repair.


[18-Feb-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I’m almost thinking it would be a good candidate for an MCB or even WCB STL ship. Cutting down the trips would “way” cut down on the damage, and with them so close even a GEN can do the trips without it taking 8 years


[18-Feb-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I was making average 5 round trips a week, and had to others running 7 a week (my ships would do other runs)


[18-Feb-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	problem is once you go up to a MCB or WCB, you get rid of the big upside of a glass stl ships, the CQT being super cheap


[18-Feb-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the increased costs pile up enough that it's worth spending the extra to make it ftl capable, and once you have a WCB that's ftl capable, you don't need to build it in system anymore


[18-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah,  it that itself is still a sub mil ship. Since the increase for a CQT to CQS is about a quarter mil


[18-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So you get an STL WCB for right around a million. Could field 3 for the cost of 1 FTL.


[18-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, and the cost of a shipyard is 88 Afabs, at 50k each min, that is 4.4 million


[18-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and some Afabs are quite a bit more


[18-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So if 2 people went in on a SY and each built an STl WCB it would be about break even with 2 FTL’s. More than 2 and it’s coming out ahead.


[18-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I tried to find someone interested, no one was when I looked last time


[18-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So if we found 3 people who wanted it….it’s a cost savings.


[18-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I know nap wants one…and while I don’t want it “yet”, I will in a few weeks.


[18-Feb-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it was hard enough getting someone interested in the infrastructure to build Adalina up (WH, LM, admin, CoCG)


[18-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	did better math, though rounded a bit, 4.9 illion


[18-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	plus actually collecting that many Afabs is a pain, they aren't all at a single CX, you need to visit at least 3 to get that price


[18-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or build a PP4 and try and source. I do have a guy who will sell me Rfabs under market…or said they would anyhow, lol


[18-Feb-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm in the process of seeing up a PP4, but that would take 70 days of manufacturing time to actually make, not counting some of the earlier steps


[18-Feb-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Probably has to do with the 5 figures of EPO I dump on him every week =)


[18-Feb-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you do end up considering the shipyard on Berthier, let me know, I'll be happy to contribute a bit to it, though I don't need it now (I need more FTL ships more than anything, my shipping between those planets is low enough that I can run it off my current shipping easily

[19-Feb-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, for whatever reason this has been scratching around at the back of my head. A few days back while talking about ship upgrades, I noticed someone day something about acceleration chairs, and someone else say they're not important unless you "go fast". I just wanted to point out while it was on my mind. Better acceleration rates, in both the real world and the game, make trips take less time and are more fuel efficient.


[19-Feb-23 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For taking less time, the greater your acceleration, the more quickly you'll reach your "cruising speed" (the amount of Delta-V you're going to apply before you stop thrusting), and the later you can wait to begin counter thrusting to bring yourself to "rest". Which works out to more time at that cruising speed. For efficiency, the further ahead of turnover the thrust is applied, the more distance you'll travel from that extra thrust. By accelerating faster you put more energy earlier, thus increasing efficiency. This is why when you push your throttle to the maximum, you gain very little on the speed per unit of fuel burned. Almost all of that fuel is being applied later in the burn and so very inefficiently.


[19-Feb-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah, that was me


[19-Feb-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i absolutely abhor the travel time for the 50,000km to get to the 'orbit' point to jump out


[19-Feb-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	or back to the planet


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	sorry, missed a decimal


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, it's a lot more than 50K KM's. it's more like 50 million if I'm remebering right.


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	50,000,000 km


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, yeah, you caught it


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	had to pull up my current flight to HRT


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and thast when the planets are mostly aligned :(


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	wish it was documented on HOW travel is done


[19-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But yes, more acceleration means faster, more fuel efficient trips.


[19-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Even if you don't plan pushing your throttle


[19-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	is it a set radius from solar center? is it set radius in the direction of the system your  jumping towards, is it a random spot in system


[19-Feb-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	im just especially happy that planets orbit as fast as the do


[19-Feb-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think it might be a set position relative to the planet. There's no time variance in FTL flights with identical fuel burns and specs regardless of orbital position.


[19-Feb-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	because it irked the hell out of me when doing jump calculatinos and i move the fuel usage slider 1% and the distances are wildily different


[19-Feb-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	then i remebered, oh yea, planets move


[19-Feb-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which indicates the transit position is a set point against the planet.


[19-Feb-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	which then begs the question, wtf are the radius numbers on the system map then


[19-Feb-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not just that planets move. Sometimes it goes ahead and calculates an entirely different trajectory.


[19-Feb-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ie,here, 3 planetst within the 01 marker, and only d within the 01 and 02


[19-Feb-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	are those au? 100mil km? etc


[19-Feb-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I dunno, lemme look.


[19-Feb-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so much undocumented, but probably for good reason


[19-Feb-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, they're obviously distance measurements since they are concentric and equally spaced. What the distance is.......


[19-Feb-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm guessing they're about 100m KM, but that doesn't really matter for calculating distance since you're not flying a straight line anyhow


[19-Feb-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	its probably not also an AU marker, sicen one would equate 1au with the habitable zone, putting fertile planets in that range


[19-Feb-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but checking 3 plantes puts one at +12 fert at half that disance, and another at -1 at just inside the 01 marker :(


[19-Feb-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	pardon the random musings of a newbie as he waits for slow FTL travel :P


[19-Feb-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, 1 AU is the distance from the earth to the sun, but the habitable zone of a star changes radically based on what the star is.


[19-Feb-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So I'd only expect the habitable zone to be 1 AU at "our" star, and any other stars that are very, very similar.

[20-Feb-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's you who's also making carbon down here, right?


[20-Feb-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	C and SF running strong. Will be expanding the H2O and GAL exports soon


[20-Feb-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, I was wondering if you'd like to join me in something...it might be completely useless for you and just money down the toilet. But in another 2 or 3 days I'm going to have my first wave of HYF's up on Prom and really begin moving stuff down here to torch C.


[20-Feb-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Sounds interesting, what's up?


[20-Feb-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm just going to contract out the shipping from Prom to Bou in the hopes of driving some ship traffic down here to make exporting easier for everyone. Would you be interested in also generating shipping contracts to feed your INC's. With both of us doing it we might drive a good chunk of shipping down here.


[20-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	hmm maybe. I'd have to do some maths. Currently make the HCP I burn onsite.


[20-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Been looking at repurposing Prom to just feed some fast-recipe inc up here but haven't pulled the trigger yet.


[20-Feb-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, so not nearly as much then. I'm cooking it all up on Prom, so I make a shipload every 2 to 3 days that needs to get moved.


[20-Feb-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I just decided to pull the trigger myself earlier. With the RAT crunch going on I shifted all the FRM's to max water consumption to boost production....and then figured, what the hell, if I'm already running the stupid high water BEA recipe, I may as well go whole hog and put in the HYF's, lol


[20-Feb-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm starting to do more shipping as I expand though and will probably be on that track


[20-Feb-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	nice lol that works. Ran the calc for 10 FRM 5 HYF to feed 8 or 9 INC. Would add about 20 C/day and let me expand fuel 5x so I'm thinking it's gonna happen


[20-Feb-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Only thing holding me is the Lure of making DDT and turning Prom into HER/FIM but I feel like that's a trap.


[20-Feb-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My build for PRM tomorrow will be a bit dumb, until I can get a few more bases built, but it will retain my 1 BMP and PP1, and 2 WEL's to keep working towards more HYF's. Then 7 HYF's and 18 FRM's. Should do 1550 RAT's per day and 90 triple recipe C.


[20-Feb-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I had wanted to downsize it to 2 permits, but that'll have to wait until I can afford to put up 15+ HYF's


[20-Feb-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice that works out.


[20-Feb-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, and 2 CHP's. I figured I'd just go ahead and integrate the NS on-site until I go full HYF's and make a NS production base.


[20-Feb-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Still trying to stick to 1 permit/base so the max I could get with a 5 HYF set was about 150 C/day. Currently about 50 and 80 so it would work out. Then add like 2.4k or so SF/day


[20-Feb-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You mean here on Boucher?


[20-Feb-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	my next base is the mutt for a bit lol. gonna have manu (cogc), chem, metal, and maybe some con.


[20-Feb-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yea, if fed by prom


[20-Feb-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm super conflicted on my next base. I really wanted to do the fab bases, but once I saw how much nylon and PE that's going to eat, I suddenly wanted nova since I already have the huge EPO base so I can easily throw in a few runs of PG to feed some WPL's


[20-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	It does take a ton but you can run a couple BMP and 1 pp2 while you're getting the manu base built.


[20-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	have 4 BMPs headed to nova h now so I can start stripping the adalina ones out


[20-Feb-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, but the market is so hungry for NL I figured just going whole hog on the manu base probably wouldn't actually hurt me financially.


[20-Feb-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Gonna drop 2 WPL on hova h but I want to build the fabs for it myself instead of buying so they'll come later


[20-Feb-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lfabs hurt my wallet, want to sell them not buy them lol


[20-Feb-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And my EPO base can do something like 5700 PG in 1 day if I divert it for a bit, so supplying those WPL's shouldn't be too bad.


[20-Feb-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	jfc.


[20-Feb-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	needed like 400/d for my calcs iirc


[20-Feb-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, yeah, that was my thought process as well....at first. Then I realized how little profit there actually is outside of the LDE's and I was like....huh....I can actually make more cash just buying them and doing something else for the moment.


[20-Feb-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So long as the stupid things are available at all. I had to "send out" for the LSE's I needed here recently. HRT was just plain empty.


[20-Feb-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Haha, yeah, 24 POL's chew up PG....EPO too for that matter.


[20-Feb-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Still waiting for expert 5 to spawn on that base so I can get truly stupid output.


[20-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oof. i just bought the 4 i needed for the core but refuse to buy the rest. should have 1 pp2 back in business in a couple hours then just need to send a ship full of ALO out to process.


[20-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol only have 5 experts on prom so far


[20-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	well, 'of a kind'.


[20-Feb-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Same. Everywhere else is at 4.


[20-Feb-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I ship goods into Boucher, problem is my base inventory is currently very full, I need to ship more out of it before I ship more in, because the last few trips here have all been with full cargo holds, and they left with full cargo holds, this means the total goods stored here was more or less unchanged, just the types changed for different stages of production


[20-Feb-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	even the warehouse is full, I have enough space for a single cago ships worth of goods to arrive, and only if it's a starter ship, recently, whenever my ships arrive, I have to move the goods in stages because I can only fit so much into the base, to make room in the ship, to move stuff out of the base, to move more in the ship, etc


[20-Feb-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	problem is, every time I come here, I stop at Promitor first and pick up a full load of burnables to shove into a INC, or a load of AMM and H to run my REF on


[20-Feb-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, the base is fairly well stocked with inputs now, but it seems like such a waste, if you want to put some cargo up at Promitor to ship down here, I can, I have a ship arriving at Promitor that will then head here in 3 hours, will take a bit over a day to make the trip here after that


[20-Feb-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My goal isn't so much to move "my" cargo down here (although, obviously, it'll have an effect), it's to increase the number of cargo ships arriving here so that we can also push more outputs out via shipping contracts.


[20-Feb-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough, I have the same problem, I'm bringing a mostly empty cargo ship in soon, but it's to move my own goods, I have enough C here to fill a WCB, and enough water to fill a LCB

[22-Feb-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	current ask price is nearly 2x the max price band, and im not pro-old enough to place an order outside the price band;


[22-Feb-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	idr how to do the ticker link thing, tectosilisite, it processes into he3


[22-Feb-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hizumi, do you still need to buy HE3?


[22-Feb-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The price bands are screwed because someone sold to a super low bid. I’ll buy a unit and bump them back up if you need to make a purchase


[22-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to link a MAT . CX ticker, it's case sensitive, and it's based on the CX ticker code, not the location, in this case TS.IC1


[22-Feb-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vornoxem**:	ah right that was it, thanks


[22-Feb-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Throw the C on and not enough room for the SF. Never enough room for the SF. Don't even want to talk about GAL.


[23-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, how much daily GAL are you producing for export?


[23-Feb-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you're looking for a way to be rid of it, DM me a price and number of units per day. Then I'll see if it would make sense for me to drop a pair of RIG's to add a REF and process a bit of SF on site and reduce your export load a bit.


[23-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	not a lot just never have a chance to move it lmao. only have 1 EXT still but up to 80 back stock


[23-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'll have 3 EXT in the plan but i'ma need to get this WCB done first


[23-Feb-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on 5 extraction experts and 1 fuel expert, a single EXT can supply 2 REF with only 2 extra 0.6 extra per day


[23-Feb-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah the extra was set for sales but I didn't exactly consider shipping weight...

**N0ma13**:	I knew that'd be a meme


[01-Mar-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm starting to feel a little crazy. Put a base down on OZ-189a as a HAL tap, seriously thinking about setting up OZ-189 c as a chem planet. And then since low pressure doesn't really cost anything....doing OF-443B as a manufacturing planet. Then you'd have the manufacturing 1 jump from the PG source, and the construction/metallurgy on Adalina and Berthier 1 jump from PG/EPO and 2 (short) jumps away from the manufactury.


[01-Mar-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Would definitely be expensive, but POL's are only settlers, so not super expensive. Same with weaving plants and the lower end bits and bobs. Pioneer/settler. I don't think it would be too outlandish. Worst would probably be building 2 CoGC's.


[01-Mar-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I did the same with SE-648B since at the time it was a chem CoCG (switched just before I built a base and I can't flip it back) and it was low temp. once you have the core planets in a region built, you start looking at next tier stuff to expand bases production bases onto, since you don't need to worry as much about resources on them if they aren't going to have resource extraction buildings on them


[01-Mar-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm still hoping if I get infra down on 189c to make it a chem planet, the couple of people on 189a paying a fortune in TSH's for their chem building repairs will migrate to c...but if not, the set up works even without having A as RE.


[01-Mar-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	currently looking at VH-778b as a electronics base near HRT... since it's not very build up and it's only low temp, and I couldn't find a better planet near HRT that I use as a electronics base


[01-Mar-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Low temp is still kind of pricy, isn't it? I was thinking low pressure was the cheap one, or do I have that backwards?


[01-Mar-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	low pressure is the cheap one


[01-Mar-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	low temp is next best


[01-Mar-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, that or gas giants, but they tend to have other problems as well


[01-Mar-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	high temp is the most expensive, followed by high pressure, not sure where gravity fits in terms of pricing, I was told ages ago and can't remember the answer


[01-Mar-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Less, a lot less.


[01-Mar-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	High gravity is hardly even a thing. 2-5K more per building. Low gravity is more, still a lot less than high temp.


[01-Mar-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, it's that or I start looking for valuable planets away from the 4 main CXs, currently this is the furthest away planet I have


[01-Mar-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you can drop off a load to Avalon, I can sell you some RAT there at HRT just under HRT prices to take up to MOR, since they sell well there (usually)


[04-Mar-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	or I can sell H2O here at 18/unit since that is comparable to HRT price minus the extra shipping, it is currently cheaper in BEN, though I think that is due to increased prices locally more than anything

**N0ma13**:	Using like 10/day but moving that to prom soon.


[08-Mar-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	anyone heading back to HRT with room?


[08-Mar-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think that's one thing no one has, lol. Bou output exceeds inputs by a freakish margin.


[08-Mar-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	How much cargo and on what timeline did you need?


[08-Mar-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah it's brutal. Got a full load of C ready to send out, plus more, and the H2O piling up again. smdh


[08-Mar-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, damn. If it was something small I'd have seen about dialing back my H2O exports and getting you a small slot on my regular shipper. I can't defer an entire shipload though.


[08-Mar-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Mostly just need a full 500 load moved but the rates people want to go as slow as possible are ouch


[08-Mar-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	nah you're good. Might just build a sto here next cycle and just use the wcb ship to move in bulk


[08-Mar-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, you don't have an STO? I'd die without an STO here.


[08-Mar-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah have a little work/rework to do still. moving the HYF to prom and adding more REF and a STO but thinking the STO is gonna come next


[08-Mar-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Have any building supplies down here?


[08-Mar-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's unconventional, but if you need some space I could lend you some of my STO


[08-Mar-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you trust me to hold on to them for a bit that is ;)


[08-Mar-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you have 2 BDE I have everything else down here to build an STO.


[08-Mar-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're just chilling waiting for use as repair materials, so I can always bring more stuff down later if you can scrounge up those BDE's.


[08-Mar-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I have them at HRT so next trip out I'll bring them. Not critical yet, I use the warehouse as extra when I need it


[08-Mar-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	appreciate you both


[08-Mar-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	np :)


[08-Mar-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	who Of course forgot to bring OVE with him >_>


[09-Mar-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lmao. I can spare you some. I've got 10 days worth yet. What do you need


[09-Mar-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well I could buy you as much you're able to share :)


[09-Mar-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	foor 125/u?


[09-Mar-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure, let me cut a CONTD


[09-Mar-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	awesome, big thanks


[09-Mar-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	again lol


[09-Mar-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	you've been saving my ass lately ^_^'


[09-Mar-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Let me know if you have ship time to get more down here, otherwise I can add some extra OVE's to my shippers resupply run.


[09-Mar-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	aight, I'll sort my base a bit so I know when I need to make next supply run


[09-Mar-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it's not so much a time thing. If you'll need them ferried down, I'll just load a few extra pairs onboard his ship. He runs my INC fuel down and carries my water back, about 3-4 day round trip.


[09-Mar-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ye I'll need to make second run within week or so anyway, so I'll be having my own OVE shipped anyway :)


[09-Mar-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ofc unless I forget it again >_>


[09-Mar-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	random question: does unload on arrival == contract fulfill action?


[09-Mar-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	no


[09-Mar-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ah well, worth a shot


[09-Mar-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	welcome Rento :)


[09-Mar-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	He's coming for a hostile takeover! He wants the governorship! He's got no pants!


[09-Mar-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Someone help me lead Rento into the Gov Inc (or INC) :)


[09-Mar-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	ey welcome


[09-Mar-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hey Noma....word of...uh, I wouldn't call it advice, but notice. I posted up a bunch of C hauling ads earlier....and some nice individual must be lurking around with a WCB that they use to haul water. Because they left all my better paying water haul jobs and took 1500t of C instead. So...if you want your C gone, might be worthwhile to bulk post them.


[09-Mar-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Hmm good to know, appreciate it! I have my wcb headed out in a couple days but I don't see bringing it out here often.


[09-Mar-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Hopefully I'll have my own soon as well. Just got the LFE delivered earlier today.


[09-Mar-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh yeah, one other thing. That REP buy order at the HRT CX. Is that for use on Prom?


[09-Mar-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	grats! WCB is op. The REP order is overstock Nova Honshu. Next trip out there gonna drop a couple POL


[09-Mar-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	jfc why the rat prices still going up.


[09-Mar-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because like I've said, RAT consumption exceed RAT production....or at least what's being added to the market.


[09-Mar-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, ok, if you had needed them on Prom I'd have CONTD them to you. Doesn't seem like a lot of purchase options at the CX =)


[09-Mar-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I mean I need to snag some C off prom too so I can do that.


[09-Mar-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Up to you. I'm making small quantities of REP because it became such a PITA to source. So you can put it into a CONTD if you'd rather not wait for that bid to be filled.


[09-Mar-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I keep thinking about moving to rat but it would really hamper the making things plans


[09-Mar-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I just put in low orders while waiting for a ship. If you have extra you're trying to sell i'll source from you but if it's not extra it's all good


[09-Mar-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Do both =) Make C and RAT's =)


[09-Mar-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's "extra" in that it's for sale. It's small batch in that it's only 1 BMP making it. I have the materials to make....oh...800 of them.


[09-Mar-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	How much C/d do you make on top of your rats? Also using three planets for it right?


[09-Mar-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Boucher makes 77.8 C/d


[09-Mar-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And Avalon produces 1788 RAT/d after feeding itself.


[09-Mar-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah i'm making around that at Boucher currently but the plan will put it around 150


[09-Mar-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	may have to end up adding avalon in.. need to figure out how much C i'm actually using now


[09-Mar-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Avalon is such a key pillar of the RAT mashing. I can't even begin to imagine mass producing RAT's without the full suite of efficiency bonuses


[09-Mar-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Wonder if it might be worth going to another area for rat production so I don't have to split prom farming between rat and c..


[09-Mar-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean...you can, but it's such a perfect area for it. Readily sourced H2O to fuel the horde of HYF's, chem world for NS, Farming world for ag goods, and a food planet all in the same system.


[09-Mar-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah it probably makes more sense to move the C elsewhere. I guess now that I can move more than 222 at a time that's feasible actually


[09-Mar-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	well maybe. Not sure how many good farming planets are close to good RE planets that can also water the farming planet


[09-Mar-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Probably one or two, but you won't need quite as much water on that one. Unless you plan to buy your GRN you'll still have some standard FRM's.


[09-Mar-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or you're going two ingredient C


[09-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Well the current plan is 10 FRM 5 HYF on prom to feed 8? INC on boucher doing triple recipe. makes about 150/day compared to 80 and 50 i have now


[09-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	plus let's me expand the SF from 1 REF to 5.


[09-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	But.. leave me at the whim of RAT prices.


[09-Mar-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, I'm so desperate for extra ship throughput I just sent one of my boats off for an LHP upgrade....and nothing else. Just smacking on LHP's


[09-Mar-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	i feel that though


[09-Mar-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	are shields worth it? i was planning on just slapping a bwh to manu some for my ships


[09-Mar-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and maybe selling them; but if theres no market; and honestly there seems to not be a market for ship anything :(


[09-Mar-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Plenty of ship market, it's just not on the open market.


[09-Mar-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That being said, no, shields are not generally worth having except when used in VERY specific system.


[09-Mar-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	really sad there is no open market for anything ship :(


[09-Mar-23 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Take whipple shielding. Unless you're doing a lot of STL between 2 planets inside a system with a lot of micrometeorites, it will just NEVER pay for itself. FTLing into a system with them doesn't do much, it's the STL travel driving around inside the system. So if there were 2 planets in this system, whipple would make sense if they fed each other.


[09-Mar-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, let me put it to you this way. If you could efficiently build things like LFE's and WCB's and crew quarters and bridges....you'd have buyers literally kicking your door down. They're hard to build though, and there are corporations that take ship orders, so you're competing with them. It's actually easier to sell because they have such long queues....but good luck making those products solo without HUGE investments.


[09-Mar-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, there's a lot of market for those things, they're just so hard to make they don't see the light of day on the CX's....and the things that ARE relatively easy to make fall into two categories. Widely used with a market for them (LHPs), or relatively easy to make and not used at all (like shields), and so there's no market at all.


[09-Mar-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	sadness


[09-Mar-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	christ that production chain for the LFE


[09-Mar-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Like I said...soloing that stuff is...uh....difficult


[09-Mar-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	is the LFE a one shot, or consumable?


[09-Mar-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	nevermind stupid quetion


[09-Mar-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, that was a quickly self-answered question


[09-Mar-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i pulled up a blueprint


[09-Mar-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	saw my ships hase 2 smalls, and thats not on my repair list so....


[09-Mar-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, only thing used in ship repairs are the hull plates


[09-Mar-23 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is why the hull plates have a "relatively" active market. Those are the consumables for ships outside of fuel.


[09-Mar-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	huh, apart from the infrastructure, the actual cost of a WCB is cheap


[09-Mar-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	350K is cheap?


[09-Mar-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	the raw mats for 1 WCB is 50k


[09-Mar-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i just filled some buffers to place an order to calculate cost


[09-Mar-23 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but of course, didnt factor in time, and time here costs mats too xDD


[09-Mar-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A "lot" of time


[09-Mar-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Especially if you're considering actually going back to the raw ores, and growing crops for carbon


[09-Mar-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And on single recipe carbon no less =P


[09-Mar-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	;p it was just quick math, not at aalll optimized or correctly recipe chosen

[11-Mar-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	oh it's free here? o_O


[11-Mar-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	*yoink*


[11-Mar-23 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	haha, yeah, it's why I've had 2 warehouse units here for about a year now, even though the base is only about 1 month old


[11-Mar-23 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	honestly, I'm surprised there is still warehouse units available for people to grab


[11-Mar-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	not for long, now that you've mentioned it I recon :3


[11-Mar-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it has been mentioned before


[11-Mar-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, then again, amount plots are taken here, which is around 120, and warehouse spots been taken same amount by now


[11-Mar-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, level 4 warehouse, everyone can have 2 units...


[11-Mar-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	at worst it won't drop but halfway from available units


[11-Mar-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	from=with*


[11-Mar-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, I think anyone on Promitor that runs HYF should rent one here so they can place buy orders for water here cheaply


[11-Mar-23 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	ooo yeee, didn't think that you can rent one while not having base here ^_^'


[11-Mar-23 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, lets you place orders on the LM without needing a base here to do so, and since they are free, whenever the price of water was low, I'd fill the warehouse up until the next time I got around to picking up the water


[11-Mar-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And the unemployment rate when DOWN. How many people put up bases here in the last week?


[11-Mar-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I feel like we're moving down the pop tiers lol


[11-Mar-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	But I can tell you that 7 new bases went in in the last week =)


[11-Mar-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Okay. All I'm saying is that this number doesn't necessarily have to correlate with 10k new pioneers :P


[11-Mar-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It helps attract more PIOs because lower unemployment increases happiness


[11-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No....it was more the fact that it went up by...well....10692 and the unemployment rate went DOWN 4.4%. That's either a goodly chunk of people doing a HUGE amount of new building, or those new bases were basically dropped in as size 500 full builds.


[11-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That sounds fatuous when I put this way lol


[11-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I know ONE person who dropped a full base ;)


[11-Mar-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which makes me wonder what that amount of new production is going to do to water prices at HRT.


[11-Mar-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And, since it's almost assuredly going in to feed new HYF set ups, just how hard are RAT's going to crash in the next week or two.


[11-Mar-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Hope more people go into HYFs and help address my issue with the SETs ;)


[11-Mar-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, no one is building HYF's down here =P


[11-Mar-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you should because the gov says so ;)


[11-Mar-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Stupid question for the settlers. If you're wanting the settlers to bugger off....why are you supplying the Infirmary? Comfort is in the toilet, so Health could nose dive and the Techs wouldn't care....but those settlers sure would.


[11-Mar-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And unless I misunderstand, the pioneers only care about safety


[11-Mar-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm trying to not affect the higher tier pops as they need some of the lower tier needs too


[11-Mar-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I did consider just having one week without any PFs, but I decided against it

[11-Mar-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Fair enough, curiosity on my part is all. It's not like anything is going "wrong" here, everything is great. Just was curious about the efforts to get a leaner operation. Although, in reality, even though our settler unemployment is massive...we don't really have a whole lot of them, do we?

[11-Mar-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It will be a long time, if ever, that I further expand my HYF's


[11-Mar-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	to ship C and H2O back to HRT?


[16-Mar-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	You ship your own stuff? Madness.


[16-Mar-23 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	paying 10-15% to have it shipped is madness


[16-Mar-23 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm not quite big enough to validate a need for regular shipping. I know it's coming though.


[16-Mar-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you can also empty your SF tank in HRT, leaving just enough for the trip to Boucher


[16-Mar-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	true


[16-Mar-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	use the STL Tank as a cargo bay


[16-Mar-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah helps, but making 3.5k/d it only helps a little


[16-Mar-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	need a bigger everything


[16-Mar-23 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yeah I feel that logistics constraints are underestimated


[16-Mar-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah for sure. Easy to plan a base, not as easy to plan the shipping times


[17-Mar-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a new ship with a LCB is better for this planet


[17-Mar-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	at least for the water shipments, as for shipping C back, a WCB is best


[17-Mar-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	realistically though, getting a WCB and two medium fuel tanks is the quickest route to go. Since you don't need to upgrade the crew quarters


[17-Mar-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Assuming you haven't already upgraded the 2 starter ships.


[17-Mar-23 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, get a WCB on both starter ships, then a new ship with a LCB is the best way, can include a glass STL ship if you have a 2 bases in the same system that can use it


[17-Mar-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the LCB collects the water from here, as well as fuel, and the WCB pick up the C from here, both transport out burnables for the INC on the way here, or H and AMM for the REF


[17-Mar-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I need to up the fuel tanks on my WCB but the other ship is still stock.

**supergary**:	Is the extraction just as efficient with the same building?


[17-Mar-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There is no difference at all. Extraction rates are the same…..per building.


[17-Mar-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Rigs are the smallest extraction building though, so all other factors being equal, liquid resource extraction smokes everything else….and never, ever, ever try and get at mineral water unless you love inefficiency

[20-Mar-23 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Mar-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Mar-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Mar-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Mar-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Yeah, It looked like the only area that can make fuel is far away

[20-Mar-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	nice doc


[20-Mar-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	pretty hard to find one of those these days, all the ones off the starting planets have been found, though some expansion paths are still being discovered


[20-Mar-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but that is a couple of months down the line, not a day one project


[20-Mar-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	yeah im not even gonna try to imagine what an expansion path is


[20-Mar-23 01:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's more of where you build second and third bases when you fill up your first one


[20-Mar-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	and thats gonna take months?


[20-Mar-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	god damn


[20-Mar-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	here I was thinking of trying to find a way to get a 2nd base up quick for ammonia


[20-Mar-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, 2nd base is anywhere from 40 days (very fast), to 120 days, with 60 to 80 being average


[20-Mar-23 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	best bet there would be buying it in, the game is all about trading


[20-Mar-23 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	buying it from who though? theres no exchange in system


[20-Mar-23 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	no one player can make everything for themselves, at least not for a very long time


[20-Mar-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	your starter ships are capable of going FTL to fly to other systems, and the closest CX (exchange) is the HRT CX


[20-Mar-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	your sheet says demands high, so If I can make it work, then it seems it could be pretty nice here for some dedicated fuel merchant such as meself


[20-Mar-23 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not mine, I just kept the link to it, someone else updates it


[20-Mar-23 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Nearest exchange is 5 jumps away i think? how bad is that?


[20-Mar-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's useful for cases like this, or players looking at expanding and wondering how to go about it, by pointing out what other popular planets are and how they are used, so they can figure out why they are good


[20-Mar-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not to bad, I freqently send ships 8 jumps


[20-Mar-23 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	5 is above average for a first planet though, but not unbeatable


[20-Mar-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	guess if I am making fuel, its kinda free jumps


[20-Mar-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	this planet is also good for farming, and has a CoCG (chamber of global commerce) locked in as resource extraction for water miners


[20-Mar-23 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, though the faster you fly, the more of the fuel you want to be selling you burn


[20-Mar-23 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on the plus side, if you pick up a pro account, you'll never have an empty cargo hold leaving here, there is a lot of people that want to ship stuff to HRT and will pay well to do so, though I suggest wait a week to see if the game is right for you


[20-Mar-23 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	so give it to me straight doc, how viable as a new player can I set up a fuel exclusive business here, importin 5 jumps away, and selling to locals/shipping back


[20-Mar-23 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	difficult, but possible


[20-Mar-23 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I do like difficulty


[20-Mar-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Alright Bazdakka, you've convinced me


[20-Mar-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you went all in on fuel, difficult, but if you don't mind going for 2 industries, you'll be doing what a lot of us already do


[20-Mar-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I got it all in my mind that I wanna be fuel man


[20-Mar-23 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough


[20-Mar-23 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Maybe I make enough fuel to make all yall cut back on your own productions or something, however economies work lol


[20-Mar-23 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	depends, I'm at the late game stage where I can make most things easily, or buy from more distant CXs to save cash fairly easily, I only run a bare minimum fuel build here, 1 EXT, 2 REF, and it handles my own needs nicely, for me, a base here is mostly about mining H2O to send to Promitor to grow planets (better water here, min maxing my build) , or to Avalon to turn into DW. I also run INC here to make C, which I use at 4 other planets (soon to be 6)


[20-Mar-23 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	thats a chain right there


[20-Mar-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it is, as an older player, I can make large chains like that, as a new player, it's very very very difficult to do that (though not impossible, I've known a few who have found success doing that)


[20-Mar-23 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on the plus side, not many people go into fuel in heavily in this region, at least not until they are a lot older, so new players will be your market, though later planets will need to be carefully considered


[20-Mar-23 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	and would I be needing to sell directly to them or on some kinda local market


[20-Mar-23 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	more, you list it on the CX for sale, and new players who have burned through their starting fuel will be your biggest buyers, or mid tier players that need it for shipping


[20-Mar-23 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	nobody really buys fuel then besides new people?


[20-Mar-23 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I still buy FF, I only make SF here


[20-Mar-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but I use a lot less FF


[20-Mar-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I see


[20-Mar-23 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	FF seems a bit harder to make as well


[20-Mar-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not really, yeah, TS isn't great, but you can get planets with HE3 as a natural resource, though they are all gas giants if I recall correctly, which means extra building materials


[20-Mar-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	TS was an early universe solution to the problem of no access to gas giants yet so we could make FF, now the universe is older, and easy access to gas giants is basically unlocked (people make the materials needed), mining the HE3 from them is a better solution


[20-Mar-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I see


[20-Mar-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	is the universe ever wiped?


[20-Mar-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	very rarely, last one was almost 2 years ago


[20-Mar-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	neat


[20-Mar-23 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	they only wipe it when they introduce a feature that massively changes how a fundamental part of the game works


[20-Mar-23 01:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Im assuming at this point there isnt anything really in *demand* then?

**bazdakka**:	RAT, there was a massive shortage that is only just ending


[20-Mar-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	before that it was C, Bfabs (BSE, BBH, BDE, BTA) are still somewhat short supplied


[20-Mar-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	prices fluctuate a lot in this game


[20-Mar-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I think I will try to make this fuel thing work


[20-Mar-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	open the price chart of any materials (I suggest ones that are in your base, they are good examples) and switch to 30 day view


[20-Mar-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as prices rise, people move into those markets, eventually increasing supply enough to cause the price to drop


[20-Mar-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	how do I do that?


[20-Mar-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	supply and demand curves are a thing here


[20-Mar-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	open the CX, select a good, I suggest RAT, and open its order book, and price chart and you can see recent activity


[20-Mar-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	damn


[20-Mar-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	rat spiking and dropping like wild


[20-Mar-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	huh


[20-Mar-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	STL fuel is on a big rise lately


[20-Mar-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	huh, your right, I haven't paid much attention to that market recently (since I now make my own). until this conversation anyway...


[20-Mar-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	So what your saying is theres a demand


[20-Mar-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, it'll be a case of a lot of recent production and expansion plans for people would be been the last price spike of RAT


[20-Mar-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	and thus my fuel empire begins


[20-Mar-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, good time to be getting into the fuel game


[20-Mar-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	useful hint, check the other CXs as well, the 4 central ones, HRT, MOR, BEN, ANT are worth keeping an eye on


[20-Mar-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Hydrogen, can I just breakdown water to get it? or do I need to import that too?


[20-Mar-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	sadly no


[20-Mar-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's mostly mined on gas giants, though a few normal planets have it as well in decent amounts


[20-Mar-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on the plus side, H is fairly cheap in HRT


[20-Mar-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	brutal, so I'd be making 5 jumps importing ammonium and Hydrogen to make SF


[20-Mar-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and as you just saw, SF is selling for quite a lot there, so you can buy more H compared to how much SF you see


[20-Mar-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	like I said, difficult, I'd suggest 2 day flights, as flying fast quickly becomes a case of diminishing returns


[20-Mar-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	2 days each way or 2 days round trip?


[20-Mar-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	each way


[20-Mar-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	bruuutal


[20-Mar-23 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	you want to set fuel sliders at just above minimum most of the time, at least until you know more about the game and know what you are doing and when you can push it


[20-Mar-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	idea is to time an arrive for when you know you'll be able to be online as well, no point a ship arriving when your asleep, if you can save some fuel and have it arrive when you wake up (or enough time after you've had your first coffee, tea, etc)


[20-Mar-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	whats the point of making it all the way out here if I gotta import so much?


[20-Mar-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	compared to plopping down on Hortus b


[20-Mar-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is why I said fuel is difficult here


[20-Mar-23 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Hortus B has very low amount of raw resources, meaning that the H you mine there will be very slow, also less GAL per cycle


[20-Mar-23 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	next, you see the bars o nthe planet info for temperture and pressure are in the red, this means you need extra building materials for starting a base there, and every building you make on the planet (and eventual repairs as well, but that is a topic for another time, lets not overload the new player with that yet)


[20-Mar-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	hm


[20-Mar-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	depending on what bars are in the red effects which extra materials you need, some are a lot cheaper than others to fix... with high temp being the most expensive, and high pressure second, with low pressure being the cheapest to fix


[20-Mar-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	i see


[20-Mar-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I'm just not sure to committing to the fuel idea. Haven't built a thing and already learned so much lol


[20-Mar-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why I sent you the start guide sheet, it's worth looking up on the second tab why a planet has the rating it does for some things


[20-Mar-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	ah I see, its got good rock


[20-Mar-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you do decide to reset, consider what you want to be before your do, and plan out your start, you can see more from in the game like markets and the map, than from the create a company screen


[20-Mar-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and while not a problem early on, later on, shipping every things like that is a pain in the rear end


[20-Mar-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	your ships have limited cargo space, and GAL is heavy


[20-Mar-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	where as H and AMM are light, so you can fit more in a single cargo hold


[20-Mar-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	im gonna commit to it, I'll try it


[20-Mar-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	worst case, I waste a few days, hate the game and never play again lol


[20-Mar-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	you can always reset later on if you need to, it's not uncommon for people to reset after a week or 2


[20-Mar-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	valid


[20-Mar-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when I joined, I was one of the few that got away without having to reset at least once, but 80% of people back then had to reset at least once


[20-Mar-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Im setting up extraction, should I just set it to largest order size or do I only get it on completion?


[20-Mar-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	only on completion


[20-Mar-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so, especially early on, small batches, so that you get a finished amount, and queue up extra orders, at least enough that the time it'll take to finish them all will be when you next expect to be online


[20-Mar-23 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	gotcha


[20-Mar-23 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	reason being, your workers, even when the building is idle, still want consumables (RAT, DW, OVE, etc) and so your still spending them, even if they aren't working, and buildings still degrade over time needing repairs eventually (45,, 60 or 90 days dending on the building), so idle buildings are lost money


[20-Mar-23 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so keeping them busy is an ideal is the best solution (bad jokes about no breaks for the workers)


[20-Mar-23 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	Alright, Buildings running, ships are off, lets hope this works out


[20-Mar-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	imma head off for now, thanks so much for the assistance


[20-Mar-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, pretty much all the starter packs are decent and will make a profit, some more than others, and price spikes and dips can affect how viable one or another is in the short term


[20-Mar-23 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	manufacturing gets a special mention as the only one that it is naturally hard to start as


[20-Mar-23 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the rest are fairly safe, and while at times, can only be at coasting along stages, will at least break even 98% of the time, as long as you choose a decent planet for them (you did)


[20-Mar-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thanks for being an awesome guv'nah, now you get to do it again!

[20-Mar-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	How important is it that I satisfy my workforce?


[21-Mar-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Do you like them working?


[21-Mar-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	like I built the games recommended starter buildings, but I seem to be lacking still


[21-Mar-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	i got 20 settlers without a home


[21-Mar-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Refinery? You don't 'need' to have all the workers but the building will run at decreased productivity


[21-Mar-23 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If it's your first base I wouldn't worry about the settlers until you've got a stable circuit generating profits and consumables with excess, and have 3-5 REF. One HB2 will give you 100 so covers 5 REF (or similar 20 settler buildings)


[21-Mar-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	interesting


[21-Mar-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	I understand me thinks


[21-Mar-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	just went to market and picked up a weeks worth of supplys for my current chains


[21-Mar-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	hopefully by the end of the week I can have the money to make big upgrades


[21-Mar-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	hoping to make my living off fuel


[21-Mar-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Can get a good fuel setup here for sure


[21-Mar-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Though to be fair, it's kind of a secondary focus. You can feed your own GAL and run 5 REF while still doing H2O and/or C en masse


[21-Mar-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	but lots of shipping issues with starter ships moving the gases in and the fuels out


[21-Mar-23 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	thats what I heard, but I'm gonna try to commit to fuel anyways


[21-Mar-23 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dadgame**:	try to end up making FTL fuel as well


[21-Mar-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	@--SCHAITR-- question: for consumption of the POPI buildings, does it act like workforce consumption, e.g, if one of them is missing, you get a reduced bonus; or will it not provide a bonus at all if not all the material needs are met?


[02-Apr-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It works by proportion filled at the consumption tick, so if 2 of 3 inputs are filled, we will get 2/3 of the building's benefit


[02-Apr-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	awesome

**--SCHAITR--**:	If 1 of 3 is filled, and another is only half filled, then we get (1+0.5)/3 of the benefits


[02-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	puuurfect


[02-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	One complication is the different tick timings - 3 and 10 days


[02-Apr-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah i noticed that


[02-Apr-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It makes life complicated for new governors, but you'll eventually get into the rhythm


[02-Apr-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i only as because hopefully soon i'll be doing something stupid and settling an empty planet; and the upkeep for the wildlife park doesnt look like something i can easily fulfill


[02-Apr-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No it definitely isn't easy, though I'd add that even building the PAR can be an issue because it needs HAB


[02-Apr-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	thing is, you might not be able to attract the TECs and ENGs to that planet very quickly without plenty of other support structures, so a PAR might not be so critical at the beginning


[02-Apr-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Unless you’re also vomiting forth an admin building at the same time you populate and paying out cash for immigration programs, do not expect TECs on planet for 2 months+


[02-Apr-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Point of discussion. Unless you’re far more affluent then I’d expect out of a one planet account….settling an unsettled planet is likely going to be beyond your financial means unless you’re ok with just pioneers and settlers


[02-Apr-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh no, ill barely need settlers maybe 100


[02-Apr-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	all it going to do us pump out iron and pp1 parts


[02-Apr-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And I should point out the 2 month timeframe was assuming you’re coming in with multiple players to get started. If it’s a purely solo affair….tack on a lot more time. Each player adds another 200 pioneers, and growth is based on existing population. So settling with 3 or 4 players is going to take off on day 1 with a growth rate more in-line with a solo planet that’s already months old.


[02-Apr-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, iron and pp1? You might want to look for an existing planet with a construction CoGC and iron. Adding your own CoGC is going to cost upwards of a million ICA.


[02-Apr-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if it’s a purely solo operation, if you do build the CoGC, you run a non trivial risk of a small group coming in and turning it into something else entirely after you do the work of adding population for them


[02-Apr-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh im perfectly happy to be unbonused, i just wanna know what it feels like to be alone on a planet


[02-Apr-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	sadly, it looks like it was colonized before, so i wont get the nice 4 week starter bonus of happiness


[02-Apr-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	all i plan on ploping down POPI wise is just bare necesssities, which from what i gather is just an infirmary, and safety station


[02-Apr-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	One of my new ones was like that too. Only it had degraded all the way to 0 pop, so I didn’t realize until after I settled it, lol


[02-Apr-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If all you want is pioneers….you can literally get away with nothing at all


[02-Apr-23 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	yeah, thats why ive been asking all these random questions; trying to plan ahead :P


[02-Apr-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and literally, everything ill need to fulfil those popi buildings i can build on that same planet


[02-Apr-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you just need SET, then no need for the PAR at all


[02-Apr-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Worst case you “might” need a safety station, but possibly not

[02-Apr-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Minimum SST needed, and at the very max INF


[02-Apr-23 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd say just the SST is enough though


[02-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ah see, now I was basing my idea off of the 'official' handbook docs


[02-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	"Pioneers: Life Support and Safety Settlers: Life Support, Safety and Health"


[02-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	If I dont even need that.... :)


[02-Apr-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You technically get a smatter of health and safety from your base, 50 points of each. So it’s entirely possible you could get away with nothing and just count on pioneer education to get you the handful of settlers if yo need under 100


[02-Apr-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I don’t think you could ever generate settler immigration, but you could probably keep it above actual out migration.


[02-Apr-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	prunner says 110 settlers, for the CHP and FS, which is phase 2


[02-Apr-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	havent planned past that since i dont know success state


[02-Apr-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just be aware it’s going to take a good while to get there. Check my profile, OZ-189. That’s after a month for settler count, and that’s with 5 players having boosted the starting Pio count.


[02-Apr-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh yeah, slow education to go from pio to set im expecting, if I can just keep the 200 pio to run the basics for a while ill be happy


[02-Apr-23 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thank y'all for answering questions from a clearly insane person


[03-Apr-23 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	If anyone is coming from HRT, there's some small shipping ads on HRT I've put up


[03-Apr-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	if theyre still up in 12 hrs when I dock HRT ill grab em for ya


[03-Apr-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	sorry someone took them already


[03-Apr-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	good!


[03-Apr-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
***H3kk3H** left.*


[03-Apr-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	400/400 leaving HRT in an hour if anyone needs


[03-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	if you feel like stopping by Prom there's a set heading out here


[03-Apr-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	pick up in 2hrs, here in 28


[03-Apr-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	wow the freaking BDE prices are mad


[03-Apr-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I wanted to add a shipment for you but not at these MM prices


[03-Apr-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	:D which is why i have so many lines just pumping them out for my base expansion


[03-Apr-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	next HRT docking in 21 hrs just in case


[04-Apr-23 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yes thats why I'll slowly pump my own out for now :)


[04-Apr-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Well I had to buy quite a bit because my base repairs came up the same time as going through another expansion....sorry not sorry xD ?


[04-Apr-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm just sorry I didn't have any on sale at that time ;)


[04-Apr-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	anyone making rats here? 100u buy on lm


[04-Apr-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	300/300 from HRT to here; *checks prod queue* may be 450/450 in 90 minutes; leaves in 3 hours if no takers


[04-Apr-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	there's a set on the hrt LM for 400m if you want. Should be at least 1/d there and now and then one coming back at 500. I pay 20/unit for this route


[04-Apr-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Prom LM you mean?


[04-Apr-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	*laughs manically*


[04-Apr-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i was about to say, these cargo numbers look familiar


[04-Apr-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and yeah, im running those last 3 for you right now; delivery in 12 hrs


[04-Apr-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	sorry yes, Prom LM


[04-Apr-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol nice!


[04-Apr-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	id have been faster, buuut, i misplanned my fuel expenditure


[04-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	all good, try to keep a few day buffer but man I need more ships xD


[04-Apr-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	if no one has anything direct from HRT LM, and no one beats me to prom LM, ill pick those up today


[04-Apr-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i dont ilke accepting contract unless im physically there to pick them up the second i hit accept :P


[04-Apr-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Picking it up is fine imo. It'd be a shame if someone beat you to it while you're enroute


[04-Apr-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	As long as you don't abuse the way shipping contracts are designed (i.e. take 3+3 days to deliver), you're okay in my books


[04-Apr-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah you're good to pick up early if you want them, no worries


[04-Apr-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	lol how is that abuse if thats how theyre designed :P


[04-Apr-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but yes, i agree with your side of the thinking


[04-Apr-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i dont like the feeling of being led on either


[04-Apr-23 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	soon as im ready to leave HRT, ill accept, its only a 2 hr flight so no big deal there


[04-Apr-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I often took contracts before I was there when I used to ship….and I also wouldn’t pick up until I was there. I just tried to make sure I’d make it from the time I took the contract to delivery would match the face value of the contract, and waited to pick up to have a buffer in case something weird happened.


[04-Apr-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I have just blocked someone who's really using up the pickup time fully


[04-Apr-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	like me getting horribly I’ll and not logging in at all….that totally has never happened


[04-Apr-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	5 hours left on the pickup for a trip that normally takes 1d8h on slow setting, so no way they're going to make it


[04-Apr-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Anything that was important?


[04-Apr-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Nope, just doing it on principle


[04-Apr-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	This shipper already skimmed the edge (of my principle on this) 2-3 times before, but this would be the first time they've gone over


[04-Apr-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I was referring more to…is it something you need filled until your shipper removes their head from their anus. But I’m guessing not =)


[04-Apr-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	LOL


[04-Apr-23 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	no not that one ;)


[04-Apr-23 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Your HAL is all ready for you. Now I can swap over to pumping LST for Adalina for a day or two, lol


[04-Apr-23 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I should be picking that up within the next 24hours or so :)


[04-Apr-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I really like that stupid rock now that I have a WCB. LST can pump from right next door…and if I feel like it I can even replace the EXTs on Adalina with more PP’s because the FEO yield is actually quite satisfactory.


[04-Apr-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Ty Hizumi. I didn't realize you weren't on Prom. That explains why you never see my posts till I say something.


[04-Apr-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	not a problem


[04-Apr-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	doesnt hurt me to ask in chat anyway


[04-Apr-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	pickups in 1hr40m


[04-Apr-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i should probably setup a screen with the LMs of everyone in hortus shouldnt i.....


[04-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If you move to/from Boucher, it'd probably be a good idea to at least have Prom/Ava/HRT


[05-Apr-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so for any new people joining us, RAT.NC1 price is near the upper market maker, really good time to make a lot of cash selling RAT there right now

[06-Apr-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Apr-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Looks like I'll miss the window. 1h45m from now I'll have a set ready to send out here from Prom.


[06-Apr-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i can wait no problem


[06-Apr-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	er wait, which direction is yours going?


[06-Apr-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Ok that works then. The standard 3 part load I've been doing. Need to get some stuff sent back too but warehouse already has too much in it xD


[06-Apr-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	From Prom to Boucher


[06-Apr-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If you're going to HRT from Boucher I can fill you up whenever you're ready to leave


[06-Apr-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oh yeah sure i can hop to promitor


[06-Apr-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and ah, the glory of having too much inventory


[06-Apr-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah I was trying to not use STO at first but now it's like... yeah.. bout that.


[06-Apr-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I could fill 3 starter ships outbound right now but would need to buy more HRT warehouses


[06-Apr-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	my WCB can't get out here for at least two days and it can't grab everything anyway


[06-Apr-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Mine is inbound now, 17 hours. Desperately need to haul away my carbon, lol


[06-Apr-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Probably won't even be able to clean it all out once I get here. 980 units are ready now, lol


[06-Apr-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Aye. Needa get it out to the places that need it. Gonna lose production on the plastics and the metals a bit


[06-Apr-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol nice. I sent most of mine back this week via shipping contracts but still have 300, plus a full load of SF and one of H2O


[06-Apr-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Thankfully I'm not about to run dry. 1100 C outside of Boucher already distributed.


[06-Apr-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Decided to change my expansion goals again..


[06-Apr-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice nice. Mine's all still sitting in HRT xD


[06-Apr-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Next stop will be Toktu. 20 COL, pure N.


[06-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or maybe LCB depending on the gas


[06-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	LCB best for N


[06-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	It's only like .807:1


[06-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It mixes well with oxygen.


[06-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Toktu also has decent O tbh


[06-Apr-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I had forgotten that I'd considered founding "another" chem planet down this way to take N from Toktu and H2O from Boucher and LST from wherever the hell I felt like to make NS, lol


[06-Apr-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's a couple low pressure, and I think 1 3 in the green not inhabited down in this region


[06-Apr-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You should come visit my shiny new chem world....it's shiny and new =)


[06-Apr-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I would love a green planet to drop a chem base one. I feel like I'm going to need multiples. NS for one, PG for one. Gonna need some AMLs somewhere..


[06-Apr-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I probably will just not sure if going to do the NS there or the PG.


[06-Apr-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	PG. I assume PG is going into your construction apparatus.


[06-Apr-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah and I'll keep a couple few POL on my manu planet for the NL instead of shipping it probably. At least at first. The other one is inside HRT, I keep forgetting that so yeah def NS there.


[06-Apr-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm pretty sure the chem planet I'm building is the only chem CoGC "not" on an absolute hellhole of a planet in ICA space, lol


[06-Apr-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, low pressure....but that's fairly benign compared to aberrant temperature ones


[06-Apr-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol that works. SEA is easy


[06-Apr-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It really is, I'm building 3 low pressure bases right now...and it was as simple as throwing a small stack of silicon and sulfur at my construction base, not expensive at all.


[06-Apr-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice. Once my ships are both running full time again and I get everything smoothed back out I'ma get back to expanding so I'll probably be up there soon


[06-Apr-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Take your time, it'll be another 2 POPR's before I have the workforce humming along anyhow. Just now starting to bring in large amounts of new workers each POPR.


[06-Apr-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah the N and NS will probably come first since I've got PG going at a smaller level already but idk. It's gotten pretty easy to get the mats to start a new base, just not so much on the logistics side without dumping 10-20% on shipping


[06-Apr-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I make everything myself except the MCG at this point, and any special needs, with enough cash on hand to buy whatever whenever outside of engines but the gd logistics are endgame.


[06-Apr-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, just remember, for the chem planet I run, until the population gets too large for me to handle, I direct supply HAL and LST to the planet, so as long as you're buying the stuff, you don't need to haul that in.


[06-Apr-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That's fair, will keep in mind


[06-Apr-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Does it take time to repair ships? Still outside myself that replacing the Hull doesn't repair the Hull.


[06-Apr-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, it's instant. Just poofs the plates and fixed.

**N0ma13**:	"Man my siding is getting bad. Let's replace it all." "OK! Replaced! Now let's repair all the old siding we stripped off"


[06-Apr-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I still look at it as your plates aren't damaged. It's just the only thing that's easy to mass produce that's NOT dirt cheap and takes the place of spare parts.


[06-Apr-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And naming them Basic Hull Plates/Spare Parts seems....excessive, lol. I guess they "could" make a separate "spare parts" item, but that would murder the plate market deader than dead.


[06-Apr-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	wait wait wait, roll that back 4 minutes... 'until the population gets too large for me to handle' ?? is this on 189c?


[06-Apr-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, as in, the player population there. I can't single handedly supply 100% of the HAL and LST to half a dozen players off my one HAL/LST tap in the system.


[06-Apr-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I mean the purpose of the hull of a ship like this is to protect the internals. I get the fantasy explanation thing but there already is no market for things like LHP. You can make more in a day than you need for 6 months of repairs, with one WHP. (for LHP anyway).


[06-Apr-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	player population, not the pio/set/etc population


[06-Apr-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i got scared


[06-Apr-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I know, don't think about it. Game. lol just one of those things that got under my skin.


[06-Apr-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, there's a decent LHP market. About 600 units moved on just the CX in the last week.


[06-Apr-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	We also live in a world where we use ammonia to make drinks and can't separate H/O from H2O


[06-Apr-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And think about your ship damage. The vast majority of your damage is from the reactor...directly from the reactor, as the damage increases as your reactor power goes up.


[06-Apr-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thats because we dont need to manage power


[06-Apr-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	cant do electrolysis with out power :P


[06-Apr-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And actually, the hull of space ships, in general, is to keep the space out. It's hard to travel long term in space in a vacuum =)


[06-Apr-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	all can you imagine it, new buildings dedicated just for supplying electricity... and more things to literally burn for said power


[06-Apr-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah the entire hull plates as the upkeep just doesn't fit but it's not worth much effort to change lol. just a mental thing


[06-Apr-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol yes, there's a lot more in space than just 'nothing'. Space vacuum is hardly empty


[06-Apr-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, nothing in any kind of practical sense. No "hull" made from iron and aluminum is going to survive contact with anything you're going to encounter hurtling through space.


[06-Apr-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I see about 300 LHP sold on IC1 in the last month. One person can over supply that by 50% with one HWP


[06-Apr-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nah but can you imagine the complexity of making advanced materials for everything? I mean some would love it but.. already need more people


[06-Apr-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, it's not really needed. The stuff we use now is made of aluminum and steel, and alloys thereof. It's fun to think that maybe one day we'll have a nice giant stack of unobtanium....but frankly, there's not much point in "armored" ship hulls. Space is virtually empty, and if you're unlucky enough to run into a swarm of small debris somehow....no hull material we can even begin to imagine would survive the impact.


[06-Apr-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In fact, the idea of micro meteoroids causing damage in this game annoys me far more than placeholder spare parts. Our ships should be free floating particulate matter if we encounter a micro anything at the speeds we travel.


[06-Apr-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	TBF when we've figured out FTL travel, it's probably not going to be 'moving through space'. More likely to be 'moving space'. so said debris won't matter and for non-ftl travel, we surely can withstand most of what we'll come across


[06-Apr-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think you'd be utterly astounded by the kinetic force imparted by something no larger than the size of a pebble at the speeds you'd encounter in space.


[06-Apr-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nevermind the hunks you see in fanciful sci-fi settings.


[06-Apr-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If it paid better I would have been a physicist. The quantum world fascinates me. I don't tend to get much 'science' from movies. By the time we're making ships that move through space, they'll be built to withstand the speeds they're designed to move


[06-Apr-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Could probably survive the equivalent of "grit", but god help your radiators.


[06-Apr-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I mean there's nothing to intake from space travel so nothing's getting 'inside' unless goes 'through'.


[06-Apr-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They can withstand the speeds they move "now". They can't withstand the sudden release of kinetic energy from something coming to a rapid stop when encountering said ship. Much like a car hitting a wall. We still build cars even though they turn into glorified tin cans when they hit a brick wall.


[06-Apr-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah, key is don't run into walls with your space ship xD lol we're not there yet but if we get there, we'll have gotten there. I rarely consider today's tech as the basis for tomorrow's. There was a time we didn't know what air was made out of.


[06-Apr-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	intake? Radiators aren't for intaking anything. There's no convective heat transfer in space. You need radiant heat transfer to cool off. All the heat your ship generates is just stuck there.


[06-Apr-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So you have to have gigantic radiator arrays to get rid of it, or everyone and everything cooks.


[06-Apr-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And that's one of those rules of science things. No amount of material sciences transfer will change that there's no atmosphere to transfer heat through.


[06-Apr-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	erm, material sciences advancement.


[06-Apr-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah but you're not going to have your radiators on the front of your ship and grit isn't going to impact them without getting into internals or flying through fields sideways i suppose, so set up a cleaning system


[06-Apr-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not a matter of cleaning, it's a matter of being shredded. Even particulate matter the size of grit would annihilate a radiator array.


[06-Apr-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	One built for use on Earth probably. One built for use on a space ship designed to go to other planets isn't going to work the same


[06-Apr-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Just because it hasn't been invented doesn't mean it won't. Communications used to rely on Humans and Horses and the idea of sending information 'through the air' was ludicrous.


[06-Apr-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Again, that's a matter for "unobtanium" to solve. Your radiators (since you need many, many, many, MANY times the volume of the main ship for your radiator) need to be made of something light, to not simply turn your spaceship into an immobile brick.


[06-Apr-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	dont run into walls? but then how will buckaroo banzais overthruster work?


[06-Apr-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	The model of the Atom has changed like 3-4 times? At least?


[06-Apr-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Isn't aerogel super good for heat dispersion or am I thinking wrong. May need to look that guy up again.


[06-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Super low thermal conductivity.


[06-Apr-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Had it backwards


[06-Apr-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Even if you had it the right way it wouldn't matter, since that would be relying on convective heat transfer and not radiant.


[06-Apr-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	According to NASA, space heat dissipation is done through electromagnetic radiation


[06-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup. That's what you use your giant radiator arrays for. To wick heat from the craft and radiate away. Don't think radiator as in your cars radiator.


[06-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Currently they use surface coatings


[06-Apr-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	and also radiation plates. so the tech is already in the works. Just need to ensure they stay protected and when we're at the point of making ships that go to other planets, it'll be because we figured all that out


[06-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Again, not at all likely. We make cars that are annihilated any time they run into something, because it's extremely unlikely a competent operator puts them into something at speed.


[06-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I wouldn't refer to materials we don't have as unobtanium though, notyetobtainedium maybe. Many materials we have now used to be in the realm of fantasy


[06-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Space is very empty. We aren't going to wait until we make a fantasy material to do something because there "might" be an accident.


[06-Apr-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah we design cars to be driven by humans on earth. They're not spaceships nor are they designed by space engineers


[06-Apr-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, it doesn't matter the medium. Cars, boats, airplanes, spaceships (even the ones that we fly to other planets). None of them can survive catastrophic impact with something, and we don't wait to build them until they can. Loss of life is simply expected when accidents happen.


[06-Apr-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah I think we will. Private corporations will be the first to have functional space industry starting with asteroids and the tech they create will be optimized by governments. By the time there's a need for long distance travel we'll have plenty of time working on it


[06-Apr-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Besides, even with cars we've gone from steel box you're going to die in to aluminum box engineered to crumple around key areas so you live


[06-Apr-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	.....As an engineer, I'd disagree with that statement HEARTILY. We've gone from sturdy, practically indestructible vehicles, to flimsy death traps because it's cheaper and makes the environmentalists happier.


[06-Apr-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Until cars are completely out of the hands of Humans, there's no reason to make them much better. Humans are kinda dumb sometimes.


[06-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	stats show that older cars had more fatal accidents than modern cars


[06-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of course, and they almost all had far larger and more capable engines in them.


[06-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	People like the 'idea' that older cars are more sturdy but they were designed to go like 30 mph.


[06-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They also didn't have seat belts half the time, nor did seat belt laws exist.


[06-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	You get in a wreck at 70 in a car made in the 70s vs a car made today and you're much more likely to survive today


[06-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You didn't die because the car fell apart in the old one, you died because you did the whole bug out the windshield thing.


[06-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	And now you just don't die.


[06-Apr-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The leading cause of accidental death begs to differ.


[06-Apr-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	If you look at the trend for vehicle fatalities, it's mostly been down year over year with a few exceptions. Looks to be a bit of a cycle of a few years down a year up.


[06-Apr-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	early 90s and early 2000's was really good for decreasing fatalities


[06-Apr-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Care to guess what was all the rage around that time? Seat belt laws, not being allowed to ride in the bed of pickup trucks anymore, etc. etc.


[06-Apr-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	60s and 70s was the worst


[06-Apr-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	imo, i prefer those solid steel slabs from teh 1950s, more car crashes == less ppl on the road


[06-Apr-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	All sorts of new laws that lowered traffic fatalities and had NOTHING to do with the build of the vehicle


[06-Apr-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	And tons of safety designs to the vehicles as well


[06-Apr-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	the only thing not safe is your wallet


[06-Apr-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	5 mph crash? 4k to replace your front bumper


[06-Apr-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	The fact that we're debating whether or not spaceships will be able to be designed to withstand space based on the fatality rate of cars on earth indicates we're bored.


[06-Apr-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sure, airbags and such. As an engineer though I'm telling you right now, the body crumpling is not a safety feature. It's something they design to minimize the hard caused by the cheap, super light, POS frame they use because they had to in order to meet fuel efficiency regulations from the government.


[06-Apr-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	harm, not hard


[06-Apr-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	unless youre classified a 'light truck'


[06-Apr-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	looking at you SUVs


[06-Apr-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	IDK man less death and less exhaust seems like a win/win. If it's a combination thing I guess it worked. Still have zero doubt we'll be hurtling through space one day. May not be done by the engineers of 2023, but the best engineers of the day weren't designing engine-powered mining rigs until almost 1700.


[06-Apr-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I never said we won't have spaceships flying around.


[06-Apr-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	started smelting iron in 930BC.. tech comes


[06-Apr-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I said we won't have spaceships flying around that can survive impact with space borne debris.


[06-Apr-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The entire point of the cars, planes, boats, etc is we do NOT avoid using a mode of transportation because smacking into something while using it will kill us.


[06-Apr-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	We do it anyhow if the risk of smacking into said thing and dying is low enough.


[06-Apr-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And space is very, very empty. If we fired off 100 ships at a target on slightly different trajectories, it's pretty likely most if not all would encounter a big fat gooseegg on the way.


[06-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	We're also not using them to relocate humankind to other worlds. Maybe we're imagining the future/use/need for long distance space travel differently. If you're referring to the idea of just scooting about colonized space, probably not. I'm talking about colonizing space where a mistake could ruin the entire mission and possibly the future of the species. Yeah, we'll put the effort in there. Perhaps not the former though


[06-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Space is less empty than you think but yea there's not a lot of large objects.


[06-Apr-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	particles are constantly popping into and out of existence throughout space, it's very lively. That's more my concern.


[06-Apr-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, that was literally what we did with boats. We moved the human race to a new continent (at least new to the nations doing it) when plenty thought the planet was flat. And every time a ship went down that was it, curtains. The place needing the supplies died, the colonists aboard went to the briny deep, etc. etc.


[06-Apr-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	We weren't building space ships though and the boats we built did get better and safer over time. There are ships now that are simply not going to sink without doing it on purpose, like plowing into land


[06-Apr-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You're literally saying the same thing I am, only that when spaceships start going out to distribute the human race, it's not going to be any safer than when old rickety leaky death traps started making trips over an ocean where no one knew what was out there.


[06-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	People will die, ships will break, and we'll still do it.


[06-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm saying that we'll pass the rickity stage before we send on important missions


[06-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, why, because the lowest bidder said it was safe? You have far more faith in governments and corporations then you should.


[06-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just remember, the government stamp of approval always means "The cheapest, fastest, often most ill-equipped moron available" made this.


[06-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Corporations are greedy but they protect their investments.


[06-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Gov depends on the country and timeframe so maybe.


[06-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically all of them, ever. No government hands out contracts to the highest bidder.


[06-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Sure there will be mistakes but I don't imagine the team in charge of a global project with the world at stake is going to be skimpy on supplies or design for profit sake. During the companies mining asteroids phase, yeah - people will die


[06-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	A global project? Way more optimistic than I am, lol. It'll be a race, between competing nations. Corners will be cut.


[06-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	When ships made for commercial sale are on the market, yea they'll be skimpy. That 'we're sending a ship to another planet to save ours' phase will be different


[06-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah like I said, two different scenarios. We agree on the normal space expansion scenario, just not the save humanity scenario.


[06-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Normal space expansion isn't going to be to other planets for a long time though, not planets in other systems anyway


[06-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	So no need to focus on that tech until we have a need to focus on that tech.


[06-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	All current work on ftl travel is based around warping space so impacts shouldn't really be a concern there. Only comes into play if FTL travel doesn't come through and we're forced into NLS travel - where a speck of dust can wreck your life with current tech

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	no, better healthcare is a win :P


[14-Apr-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	more hospitals just means more billing departments


[14-Apr-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I like having extra hospitals. You can leave them vacant and unused, providing no benefit at all.


[14-Apr-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But you can store more supplies in them, so you can be a more afk governor =p


[14-Apr-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	Just the location. Wouldn't extract anything from that rock.


[14-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I've also completed my long-held goal of upgrading the basic POP infrastructure by producing the prefabs myself. This is also to reduce the inputs required for upkeep


[15-Apr-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Once the building happiness contribution numbers have stabilized a little, I'll see whether there's further need to upgrade anything else


[15-Apr-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So at this point, after ploughing the taxes and the extra money Pluck left me, I'm roughly at breakeven :)


[15-Apr-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Nope I'm all good


[15-Apr-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And yes, the SET bubble.. sigh


[15-Apr-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You'd have to wipe out the pioneers somehow to get rid of the settlers, since education is just never going to stop.


[15-Apr-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I classify the bubble as "something someone else will solve some other time" lol


[15-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Btw, breakeven was what I was aiming for - I didn't want to hold on to the extra cash


[15-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If people weren't running ENG/SCI here I'd say dry up a bunch of the POPI spending and crater settler happiness even harder while keeping PIO just over 50%.


[15-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That'd take care of it right quick, but you wipe out ENG/SCI doing it.


[15-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yes I keep wondering what people are doing with the SCIs here

[17-Apr-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That implies that we have other overlords that are less benevolent. I think someone just undermined their authority =P


[17-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	the others are not as benevolent as me, so.


[17-Apr-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, but that means there ARE others. If you were just our benevolent overlord you'd be our SOLE overlord. By being our MOST benevolent overlord, you indicate you are just one of a pantheon of overlords, undercutting your authority and position.


[17-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	After all, no one is worried about annoying the most benevolent overlord. They're worried about annoying the LEAST benevolent overlord.


[17-Apr-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I gave them the overlord titles just so they'd be less annoying. They aren't actually lording over anything :D

[21-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i like those


[21-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Me too. my ships usually return with small cargoes from MOR area


[21-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	short, and good time wasters


[21-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just one ship can take 5-6 of those


[21-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Schaitr, I'm going to poo in your coffee after that little suggestion


[21-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	lol


[21-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That.. was very personal


[21-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol


[21-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, crap. Now I have to restock Adalina with LST again.


[21-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I've decided to just depend on others (i.e. Zuul) to stock my Adalina base


[21-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You didn't need that LST for anything did you?


[21-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, I have 60 pieces left. I'll be restocking the planet in about 12 hours. I'm actually 75 minutes off the source right now.


[21-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And wow I just checked, and the LM fees can go up to 9999/9999


[21-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, yes they can. The guardrails that exist in faction space don't exist in unclaimed territory.


[21-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Faction the limit is 200/10


[21-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Can't remember if you told me before, what are your LST rates on that rock? I buy from a planet a bit of a flight away but thinking about setting up my own tap once the NS goes live


[21-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	JS-572c?


[21-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	aye


[21-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm beginning to think that flight isn't worth it, hence buying it from Zuul lol


[21-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I sell for 130 in the area, although, if LST rates don't start falling, my prices may go up. I'm already making more when I ship to the CX, and prices keep going up.


[21-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Take a look at CXM LST if you want a heart attack. Pay special attention to the supply volume.


[21-Apr-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I pay like 60.. I mean how much do you pull/d/ext


[21-Apr-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, hell, I don't even begin to know, I run 3 products through. Let me get to the math.


[21-Apr-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I actually mine everything that can be mined on that rock, lol


[21-Apr-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oh no worries if you don't know. I can always open prunner too


[21-Apr-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	581 per day now if I do pure LST, now that the CoGC finally flipped resource extraction.


[21-Apr-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That's on 'a' right?


[21-Apr-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup.


[21-Apr-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The high temperature hellhole.


[21-Apr-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I need more ships.


[21-Apr-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That's repeatedly the realization I'm coming to


[21-Apr-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	My ship number 3 is on order. It was 3rd in the queue when I checked 4 days ago. Sad sorry MCB, but it has an FSE, so there's that =)


[21-Apr-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Should be perfect for running Boucher and freeing up both my WCB's.


[21-Apr-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Nice! I'm adding a UPF to start working on mine


[21-Apr-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	figure I'll make what I can while I pile cash


[21-Apr-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I still can't believe how fast that 189c planet is growing. About 3 weeks from now there will be 8 players there if no one else drops in unexpectedly.


[21-Apr-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'll probably end up there after I get a couple other bases going tbh


[21-Apr-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	next is N, then NS so naturally LST should follow and I'ma need some EPO so yeah


[21-Apr-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm working up my new manufacturing planet now. Hoping to throw down a CoGC within the next couple weeks. The chem planet is pretty well built. I shouldn't even need to look at POPI for a few months.


[21-Apr-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	nice that works. Got manu on NH but it's really mostly chem xD


[21-Apr-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I thought about Nova Honshu myself. As a planet, NH is objectively better. I'm a huge proponent of location, location, location though. And the new one is just so perfectly placed if you're using Berthier/Adalina/OZ already though.


[21-Apr-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah fair. NH was base 4 so I don't think you had started building out OZ yet


[21-Apr-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I had not. 189c is literally only on POPR 6, and that only 2 days ago.


[21-Apr-23 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Still blows my mind that I'm up into techs and it's not 2 months old yet, lol


[21-Apr-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah it's cool that you can build out new rocks. My end game goal. Maybe if I could stop changing things lmao.. or the C market would go back up


[21-Apr-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've got 2 new ones on the horizon, well, 1 and a half since I'm technically already dirtside on the manufacturing one.


[21-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	When I've got more ships I plan to build a rimworld just for the fun of building a rimworld but haven't decided where yet. Figure by then anything closer of real value will already be taken


[21-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Gonna do all my real production in this area though


[21-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	'this' as in you know where


[21-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm almost certainly going to turn AJ-293a into a pioneer only (until someone comes along and screws it up) FP planet for making DW off of Boucher and Coffee via bean imports from Prom.


[21-Apr-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Been thinking about finding a way into RAT/DW without jacking up current production. IE: no prom/boucher. Probably makes more sense to move C/SF somewhere else but so much work..


[21-Apr-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	See, for me Boucher produces more than enough water to run my HYF's, but there's no more food production area without just adding more permits to Avalon. So I figured doing DW with PG off of Boucher would keep me within Bouchers production limits, and coffee would eat up enough extra time to make it worth a base.


[21-Apr-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Gonna need another H2O source anyway for the NS planet. Make just a bit more than Prom needs for C fuel


[21-Apr-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	DW wouldn't be a bad idea if you have the water already


[21-Apr-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm thinking about ending C production on Boucher as well. Pure H2O Boucher. PD-754d might become my incinerator planet.


[21-Apr-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	not a bad idea. may need to recalc, when i designed it was more profit to make sf here than go full H2O after the C line. if the difference isn't too much though, might drop the SF for more water


[21-Apr-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	That would also let me drop to all Pioneers and save on consumables


[21-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	a lot of work to build a new planet just to burn C but.. at the same time.. might actually be worth it


[21-Apr-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Could potentially also do OF-586B for burning C. There's "technically" GAL there, but I haven't checked what the output would be.


[21-Apr-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Eh...basically enough that once you're at full experts 1 EXT could run 1 REF making GAL based SF full time.


[21-Apr-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, on pure PIO anyhow. So not great.


[21-Apr-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	eh not the best but if you have extra space


[21-Apr-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'd much prefer a planet with oxygen....and there is an option for it, but paying for HSE's on INC's makes me twitchy.


[21-Apr-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm actually thinking about it since O supplies are getting....wobbly. OF-208C. Liquid O2. Downside is high pressure.


[21-Apr-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And that would put the O tap 2 jumps from the smelters and 3 from the chem planet.


[21-Apr-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	that's a bit away but a good LCB would help


[21-Apr-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	actually O by itself? maybe v?


[21-Apr-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, for the C burning planet. So C and O there.


[21-Apr-23 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if you're running Berthier as metallurgy...the output is all going more or less next door.


[21-Apr-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	ah i gotcha, missed a step lmao


[21-Apr-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically there's even a water tap in the same system if you're ok with high temp. Hmmm, now my wheels are spinning. If I go into TSH production (which I need to do to keep OZ-189a in check) then I could have a powerful H2O source there without being completely obnoxious. Then could turn PD-754d into a HYF world for feeding the INC's. Could have a water tap world, HYF, INC/O, Chem, HAL/LST tap, Metallurgy, Construction, and Manufacturing all very close to each other.


[21-Apr-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That water tap one even already has the CoGC.


[21-Apr-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	gonna need more ships.


[21-Apr-23 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Guess I'll get to looking at it soon enough since I'm producing my own Rfabs now. Won't be too long before I have 4 or 5 permits to play around with.


[21-Apr-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To a degree, it helps that it's almost daisy chained. Just flit from one planet to the next in a nice line. Grab H2O. Move 2 jumps, dump H2O, grab plants. Move 2 jumps, dump plants, grab C/O. Move 2 jumps, dump C/O grab metal. Intra-system flight, drop metal, grab fabs. Return to CX and repeat.


[21-Apr-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And the CX is only 3 jumps from the start point, lol


[21-Apr-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol that works


[21-Apr-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically, since fabs don't even take up much space you could add in 1 system jump to OZ-189a, grab LST, intra system to C, dump LST, grab NS. Then you can deliver the NS to the HYF's on the same ship since that's the part of the route where you don't have much cargo anyway.


[21-Apr-23 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And if it's in my happy time future where I've magically vomited shipyards everywhere, you'd omit the intra-system flights because the glass ships would have serviced that need already. So just pop into the system and go.


[21-Apr-23 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah that's what I'm waiting for. Start with OF-375 ;-)


[21-Apr-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Lol, that ones still unlikely to be any time soon, especially if the Adalina gov doesn't build any comfort POPI since I can't really do a PP4 until then.


[21-Apr-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	:(


[21-Apr-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I guess I can do it my damn self, but I'd need to hand control of C over first, and then run for gov there....probably just be easier to ask nicely, lol


[21-Apr-23 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	lol I plan to help once that project gets underway but not really pushing it yet


[21-Apr-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Short of someone having PP4's to blunt the cost, it's really just a money pit. Throw enough money at it until it's full, lol


[21-Apr-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Well if enough people join the cause maybe the share will be small enough that a glass ship will turn a short enough ROI


[21-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	looks like @zuul has a new plan :P


[21-Apr-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Same plan, just bigger, lol


[22-Apr-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you provide housing and jobs for them, they will join you (this is a simplified version but this will do for now)


[24-Apr-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	However, they will also use different higher-tier consumables, so I would recommend sticking to the Pioneers for now


[24-Apr-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I don't have the exact figure now because prefab prices fluctuate, but it should be around 5-600k


[24-Apr-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Oh wait I think those were my figures for a fully productive base. If you're setting up just a small number of buildings it should be less

[25-Apr-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR's looking as intended, but not enough buffer to risk going no programs. Continuing with PF2 in the coming weeks.


[29-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I haven't been paying attention to how well stocked the POPI has been here. Has the Safety station had DW and OFF, both, for the last 4 weeks?


[29-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not some kind of oblique criticism, just trying to get an eyeball on the needs met vs population size and POPI levels. But since it uses a rolling 4 week tally it's hard to know without knowing if it was stocked continuously


[29-Apr-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I stock it every sunday to the maximum, which is 30 days


[29-Apr-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So that answers that then, that's full output.


[29-Apr-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	(unless I forget to bring something over, that is)


[29-Apr-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, 2/3rds, but what whackjob uses stretchers on the safety station


[29-Apr-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's cheaper in the short term if you don't want to upgrade the POPI


[29-Apr-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Perhaps to boost the pop for 1-2 cycles (10-20 days)


[29-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Sort of...but you really need to run it for a month because of the rolling nature of it. Adding it for 1 cycle only gets you a quarter of the benefit of having it at all.


[29-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And I'm thinking of the wrong material anyhow. Stretcher is Infirmary. SST is, what, safety uniform?


[29-Apr-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I had the fortune not to have to do those calculations and I just stick to the least expensive inputs as much as I can to balance the books


[29-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I've been kind of wondering about a wellness center. The upfront build is kind of....eww, but being able to feed it with DW for extra health and comfort is tempting.


[29-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It contributes a different amount of health and comfort though, not like those which specialize in one area


[29-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Can't recall what the difference is


[29-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's less. It's not the same, but it's still more of them with water.


[29-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I believe a small specialized is 2500 with all channels used, and the split ones are 2K


[29-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	@zuul when you first populated 189c, do you remember how many pio initially settled?


[29-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's 200 per player base.


[29-Apr-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	oooo, okay


[29-Apr-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thats sweet


[29-Apr-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Apr-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	that actually fits in line with what I figured my ability to plop new buildings would be like population/time wise


[29-Apr-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	perfect, thanks!


[29-Apr-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR looks as expected. I'll not be using any planetary programs for the next POPR to cull the excess.


[06-May-23 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Even though no one asked, it's so that the extra and unemployed populations stop taking up POPI inputs (you can see the % need fulfilment at the bottom of the POPR increased even though I didn't do anything different from last POPR)


[06-May-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	you can assume i asked silently :)

[06-May-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	no, thank *you*


[06-May-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of course, the fulfillment %'s can be a dirty, dirty, filthy batch of lies. Since it doesn't actually show the true fulfillment, but rather hides it, then combines it with the prior 3 weeks, averages it out, and that's what it shows. And none of the prior weeks show the true fulfillment either. That would make it too easy to be precise.


[06-May-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The only one that's not a filthy stinking lie is the very first week, and every week after that, if you never come off of 100% =)


[06-May-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So it's kind of a gamble, which I finally feel comfortable taking lol


[06-May-23 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-23 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-May-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**supergary**:	please contribute etc, it would be a very profitable planet


[07-May-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Out of curiosity, why there for making fuel? TSH for refineries and no native resource related to making gas seems...an odd choice? Although I admit I haven't actually looked at the other planets in the system.


[07-May-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Actually, now that I looked...I'm even more bemused. No AMM, no H, no HE3, and 1 tiny dusting of GAL in that entire system.


[07-May-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**supergary**:	i make stl fuel mainly so might as well go for it, its the planet nearby with the most TS


[07-May-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**supergary**:	and for fun i want to colonize


[07-May-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I didn't even notice the TS, just as a note, are you aware that HE3 can be harvested naturally, and does not require harvesting TS?


[07-May-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**supergary**:	didnt know but i dont care tbh, il be setting up security etc soon if anyone wants to join


[07-May-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, good luck with your endeavor, but I don't think you'll get many takers. It's a pretty rough planet for making fuel on. If you're just looking for TS to make HE3, VH-043E is next door to the CX and produces HE3 naturally. Aj-293g produces HE3 and H on site, so it's a 1 stop FF refinery planet. TS is basically the bootstrap material for making gas before the universe has grown enough to build AEF for colonizing gaseous planets where the HE3 is.


[07-May-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	AJ has the bonus of also having no POPI at all if you're just wanting the "joy" of building up a planet from near scratch.


[07-May-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	thats me in *checks FLT* 2 hrs!


[07-May-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	was trying to math out max i could earn on a shipment and it was the same amount no matter how many i took due to my lowly 500/500 ship


[13-May-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	oh lol. yeah i set 4 sets of 3 items with each set at 400 m3 but they usually get split up


[13-May-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR's looking great - the cull of excess population has actually increased fulfilment in some areas despite not increasing any POPI inputs.


[13-May-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Will be doing one more week of culling, but will use ENG immigration program this week to address the anticipated shortage of ENGs.


[13-May-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	anticipated shortage? You already "have" a shortage =P


[13-May-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yea, 2 of em


[13-May-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@N0ma13 your stuff on Prom will be picked up when my ships are there. No space on planet now :)


[13-May-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	On a serious note though, I don't think I'd run the ENG program until another week has rolled past. Adding a 50 ENG injection would shoot the unemployment % up to around 30%. That would absolutely crater happiness and could start you bleeding almost as many as you force migrate in with the program, and that heavy happiness blow would be "sticky" as it gets pulled into the next 3 weeks averages. If you it bleed down another week first, you'll avoid the whipsaw effect and get a more gradual curve. Unless, of course, someone wants to speak up that they're dropping a new ENG building. That would take up the slack from the immigration nicely.


[13-May-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That does mean "someone" is going to be running a little lean on ENG's for a week, but I think it'd be better for healthy pop maintenance in the longer run.


[13-May-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I actually would like to hear from those who are using ENG and SCI buildings to find out what they're doing here


[13-May-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I have this suspicion that these were buildings from some time ago and they may not be active any more


[13-May-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Ty Shaitr


[13-May-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just want to know whether the POPI inputs I'm putting in for the ENGs and SCIs are being put to good use...


[13-May-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, I'd just stop providing for them. The planet is by and large going the way I expect as Boucher is used more and more for pure water. TEC employment is down to something like mid 800's from 1600 or 1700, ENG is down to about 110 from 280


[13-May-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Someone who employed a lot of ENG and TEC removed their buildings only 3 weeks ago


[13-May-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We're going through the correction now


[13-May-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just go with the assumption they're completely dead buildings. Change the taxes for ENG/SCI to basically nothing. If they're inactive, it doesn't matter. If they're active, the person running those buildings won't be getting taxed by the government anyhow and can supply the upkeep for their own workforce if they're still playing.


[13-May-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's an interesting approach. Might even allow me to reduce taxes for the rest of us ;)


[13-May-23 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd still like to hear from the people using ENGs and SCIs, so do say something here or drop me a DM if you see this


[14-May-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	let us know if you hear from the person in question, don't need to know who, just that you've heard from them


[14-May-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I removed LABS and CHP recently


[14-May-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-May-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-May-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	mmm about 18 hours, its making delivery to 778b before flipping back to HRT


[15-May-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	but theres probably someone sooner


[15-May-23 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-May-23 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	just put the orders up, there is usually a steady stream of empty or near empty ships flying out this way


[15-May-23 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-May-23 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	id say post the lm; your time/need is more important than my profit


[15-May-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	ads on LM


[15-May-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	hmm, I usually use 14 per unit of cargo from here to HRT, but that is because they are coming here empty usually, that being said, 8-10 per unit coming here is pretty good, since they can probably get a contract on the way back, making it 16-20 round trip


[15-May-23 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	so, youd say these are a bit on the low side?


[15-May-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	didn't actually look at the ads, I just use 8-10 as a baseline for CX to a planet 3-7 jumps


[15-May-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	ah okay


[15-May-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vile_Adventurer**:	well, I upped them a little anyway :)


[15-May-23 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I use a few baselines for my calculations, I haven't updated them in months, they were always quite good so even if prices of fuel rise, they should still be good


[15-May-23 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	3-5 for Promitor to HRT, 8-10 for straight CX to CX, 4-6 HRT to Avalon (or other CX to planet within same system), 5-7 Promitor to Avalon (since it's planet to planet), 6-8 for CX with less than 3 jumps, 8-10 for more than 3, 10-14 for diganol CX to CX (HRT to BEN and ANT to MOR, though usually I just do one trip straight, then set another ad for the next leg)


[15-May-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	calculated by unit of cargo, which is M# of tonnage, whichever is higher, even if 2 ads are planned to be taken together, meaning I pay more than what a standard starting cargo hold can do in a single trip if I plan it well


[15-May-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	God damn, I am like the daddy warbucks of regular shipping then. I think I issue at 8 per M3 for Prom->Ava and Ava->HRT. CX to CX I do 16-20. Frankly, much under that and you get to the point where the people hauling for you just aren't making anything.

[17-May-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, this isn't a great starter planet, it's a very good planet to expand to, but not a starter planet


[17-May-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if they want to be a vitcullar Promitor is better, I'd say better for C farming as well, though not by nearly as much, and you'd want the other planet eventually later anyway with that path, meaning since Promitor is full, you'd have to start here


[17-May-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's also a lot further from the CX, which makes the real time speed of this game more shocking

Astrophysicists investigating the planet Berthier have determined that, surprisingly, it is not a rocky planet, as previously thought.

**N0ma13**:	Berthier is not a great starting planet unless you just wanna make AL for a while


[17-May-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	in Bouchers case, it's more of a case you want to start with Promitor, better fertility and matching CoCG, then expand to Boucher, because Promitor is full you can't go the other way


[17-May-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's a good starting planet, but there is better for the same jobs that use the same CX, Berthier does a different job on this CX so it's not an apples to apples comparison

[19-May-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Some quick tips - WCBs (3kt/1km3) are more worth it than MCBs (1k/1k), LCBs (2k/2k) need other components that are really expensive, VCBs (1kt/3km3) need even more expensive components

**Karellean**:	AL and FE prices look to be rising though... FE has just 9 units on the CX left right now


[25-May-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Come join us on Adalina ;)


[25-May-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Karellean**:	so wherever I go next.. I think its an Ore mining world... and Ill dump smetlers and Prefab plants on it


[25-May-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I have a self-contained construction base there pulling FEO out, smelting them, and making  them into bfabs


[25-May-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just need to import LST


[25-May-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-May-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Nova Honshu if you want to go into manufacturing


[25-May-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Karellean**:	vertical integration for me.. Ore acquistion was my next step anyway.. I already put a couple of smelters up here.. with my preffab plants.. not enough to keep them runnign without import support though


[25-May-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Karellean**:	ive only just moved over to ore imports from metal imports... to try and reduce prefab costs further


[25-May-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	@SCHAITR or @Zuul, heres a kooky question for you if you know; is migration in pre-increment or post increment


[25-May-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I don't understand your question :|


[25-May-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	im at 65% happiness average; and weighted average should put me at above 70% at the next POPR


[25-May-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	does that mean, since at POPR caculation im > 70% i will get migration in,


[25-May-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	or does it mean, that since i was not at 70% before the popr hit, i wont get migration in


[25-May-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	basically, order of operations


[25-May-23 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I do not know for sure, but I'd say that everything happiness and below in the POPR gets calculated first, before those above happiness are calculated


[25-May-23 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So you should be getting some immigration


[25-May-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's whatever the happiness for that POPR shows.


[25-May-23 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That being said, it won't amount to jack diddly squat. Immigration is a % of existing population. The immigration is happiness - 70%. So with an existing population of 156 PIO, a 75% happiness would amount to 7 or 8 new PIO's...depending on how much of a fractional PIO is hiding in the numbers now.


[25-May-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-23 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's zero guarantee the person with those workers has played in many, many months. With a long enough sub they could be inactive a year and it'd still be there.

[06-Jun-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Was going to point out that flying inside this system is especially unhappy to ships. You’ll take about a quarter percent damage just making that very short round trip…..That being said, those payments are more than adequate to cover the extra ship damage (and quite nice besides).

[06-Jun-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, they're doing HYF's there.....that being said, OW. That ones REALLY going to hurt the face for shipping.


[06-Jun-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And yeah, the bit with this system being absolute HELL for shipping intra-system did need to be said, even if the pain for b <-> c is low "right this second". We're at the stage where it's like blipping from HRT to PRM when HRT and PRM are right next to each other. Once the orbits are no longer perfectly aligned again, any round trip between the two will be massively damaging, and needs to be kept in mind by anyone taking shipping contracts for these flights.


[06-Jun-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Funnily enough, B,C, AND D are all at the closest they can ever be to each other right this second. For the record, micrometeorite damage is entirely based on the distance of the flight. And at a 4.3 out of 5 for micrometeorites, it's not a minor thing here. It's the only reason I actually "didn't" set up other planets in this system when I wrote out my plans a few months ago.


[06-Jun-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	As long as no one completely loses their minds and goes out to e, it won't be utterly disastrous. That ones well over 2% for a single round trip, as an example. Still going to add up fast for a lot of cargo being shifted though.


[06-Jun-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Thx for help Zuul!


[06-Jun-23 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Np, MCG is pretty much the only construction mat I still had here, lol


[06-Jun-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	sounds like its time to invest in some shielding upgrades :P


[06-Jun-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	As I talked about…many months ago now, the ONLY shielding upgrade that makes an ounce of sense is whipple shielding if you’ll be doing a lot of STL travel in a MM dense system. Everything else is a joke.


[06-Jun-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so exactly like travel here,... as you pointed out would cause lots of damage...


[06-Jun-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup, you actually do catch a nice hit flying into and out of BOU, just from the run in or run out to the FTL jump range.


[06-Jun-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But that's usually a 2 day round trip or there about, while you could rack up more than 10x the damage in half the time if you're flying around in system.


[06-Jun-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	So prices are higher to match. And people buy repairs. The ship meta is stale and damage hardly matters


[06-Jun-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I didn't say it wasn't a good route to run with the prices being offered, I said it "was" good. But damage is something to keep in mind when you're running shipping contracts. Even with the rates you're offering (which are great), once the orbits aren't in alignment the profit for a round trip will be about 2K. Buying BHP's though are 4K at the nearest CX, and 1% damage is roughly 2K to fix. So taking a .4% knock on the round trip takes 40% of your "profit" and vents it if you're unaware.


[06-Jun-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Right now it's far more marginal. Maybe only 17-18% of the profits due to the profits being higher (super close orbits right now) and the damage being much lower (super close orbits).


[06-Jun-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's for a starter ship of course. Someone with a bigger ship that could double or quad haul those contracts would make money hand over fist and not give a single flying *bleep* about repair costs.


[06-Jun-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's also one to make damn sure when you're setting the flight to pay REAL close attention to the flight path it decides to send you on. As an example, if I took a starter ship and give it a run out to D, on minimum fuel...it sends it on a route that goes 70M KM. If you give it even a click or two of gas, the ideal travel path now goes across 147M KM. Suddenly you're eating an extra 700 credits in damage on your round trip to that world and back. Like I said, just something to be aware of...especially in this system.


[06-Jun-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	are the Whipple shields consumable like the hull plates are?


[06-Jun-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I am 99% sure they are not, from conversations I've had with other people. I do NOT however have a ship equipped with them because I have no MM heavy systems that I regularly run STL through....so I can't say for sure.


[06-Jun-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I wouldn't bother though unless you're going to maybe drop a base on C or D and run your own supplies into them. Equipping a ship with even basic whipple shielding is equivalent in cost (roughly) to changing it over to LHP's. Only knocking 25% of the damage off on trips in and out of system would take....years to realize the savings on damage. If you're constantly burning back and forth in this system though, you could see as much as a 30d or so ROI (which isn't great EITHER). Shields are pretty universally shit in this game. The only damage mitigation item I'd ever recommend is the stability system if you regularly hit aberrant gravity planets, since it's a 100% reduction.


[06-Jun-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The whipples are just the only one an argument could be made for their use if you were going to encounter this particular edge case frequently (lots of STL in a 4+ MM system)


[07-Jun-23 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if the contracts are still there in a day, I may run a few of them, my LCB ship arrives in system then, question is can I fit everything it's bringing into the base right now... I do kind of want to upgrade the warehouse, just didn't want to right now, but I do have the spare prefabs to do it... that makes it not profitable, but was going to put a few to it eventually anyway... have enough to do the entire thing myself if I want to


[07-Jun-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	I still like using the other food industries planet. I don’t know why, I’m sure the aggregate total isn’t that bad, but using INS to make DW gives me a serious case of the “EW”.

[07-Jun-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Didn’t want to deal with the extra construction costs, so put it on a triple green closer to the CX.


[07-Jun-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I actually LIKE same system horizontal integration, so what’s going on here was high on my list. Just the STL damage and extra construction costs soured me on it.


[07-Jun-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Well thats a lot more shipping cost (damage too) :P


[07-Jun-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, the shipping is almost negligible, because you’re pulling it back towards where it’s already going anyhow (HRT and associated environs) unless you’re exporting to ANT. The damage is about equal though. AJ isn’t very nice on meteors either.


[07-Jun-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Think it’s actually worse, so absolutely no cruising around in that system, lo


[07-Jun-23 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And since it’s closer to HRT, it’s easier to bring my coffee beans in from Prom. That being said, guessing that ag CoGC is also going to be for CAF.


[07-Jun-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Pity there’s not a good ALO source down here. Once the HYFs are in, and the local NS production facilities spin up, would have been nice to have a HWP knocking back plates for repairs, lol

[14-Jun-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dingbat714**:	is there a separate inventory for CXL items or does it take a while


[14-Jun-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Make sure you have enough warehouse space at the CX


[14-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	If not, the "Station" holds it in contract form


[14-Jun-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Expand your space. Then grab the contract


[14-Jun-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rannepear**:	Its a buy/sell marketplace. If you buy at a price no one is selling at, then yes your order will sit there


[14-Jun-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	If you buy at a price that matches a sell, you will receive the items instantly


[14-Jun-23 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	If you dont have a warehouse on site though, your buy (even if fulfilled) will basically go into holding. You need a warehouse there, and then you can take fulfillment of your purchase through a contract (use buffer CONTS to see open contracts)


[14-Jun-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That being said, if you don't intend to resell the product or move it through shipping contracts, you don't technically need a warehouse yet, since the contract will hold it until your ship arrives to pick it up and you can then claim it directly into the ship. Eventually you'll want the storage space, just because it's cheap. It's less important though when you're on Boucher compared to say...Prom, because the time to travel to the CX is significant instead of non-existent.

[21-Jun-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so, for @SCHAITR and @Zuul, how you do tank pioneer happiness to keep it level, when just plain old health and safety gets you nearly 100% happiness


[21-Jun-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	just unemployment?


[21-Jun-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	cuz looking at @zuul 's 189c popr, holy how that settler curve, must replicate


[21-Jun-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and yet, pioneerr is almost flat


[21-Jun-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you want to replicate my settler curve, splash a big pile of cash right up front and then run immigration programs for settlers =)


[21-Jun-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	There was a large SET open job market there so their happiness goes up higher and higher...plus immigration. for past 6 weeks..spike. Whereas PIOs were dealing with 30% unemployment. After a certain amount of time though, Safety and Health aren't enough and available jobs and unemployment factor in a lot.


[21-Jun-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Long story short, migration is a % of the already existing population, which is itself created solely from education from the prior tier. If you allow natural growth to occur, you wind up having your population tiers set up like a pyramid (until a REALLY long time goes by to allow it to naturally balance out). To get the population balance I have in any kind of reasonable time frame, you need to run immigration programs to create a large base population of that type independently of education for migration to grow.


[21-Jun-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So the only reason you see that settler “spike” from high job demand (which only increases happiness, and growth is happiness - 70% of existing population) is because I had previously run 6 settler immigration programs in a row first to get settler pop over pioneer and give it a good base population for growth.

**--SCHAITR--**:	The taxes also pay for POPI upkeep and government programs. You can see them at the POPI and LR screens from the planet info screen


[05-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup yup. Part of the governors job is setting those taxes. And a good one (like Schiatr) will, over time, adjust taxes to meet the costs of upkeeping the planet, give or take a bit. So essentially everyone is taking care of the planets needs....just the governor is the guy having to deal with the administrative busywork.


[05-Jul-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**quato**:	Will a base built on a planet without pop infrastructure be able to get get workers?


[05-Jul-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes/no, and maybe =)


[05-Jul-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, you kind of have to deep dive into planetary mechanics to answer it exactly, but in short...A new base comes with 200 Pioneers.


[05-Jul-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You'll start with 200 pioneers landing with your CM kit, but they will start to leave the next pop report without the necessary inputs


[05-Jul-23 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For populations to grow, they need to have the needs met. Safety/Health/Comfort/Culture/Education. Pioneers/Settlers really don't care about anything over safety and health...for the most part.


[05-Jul-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Planetary infrastructure provides those needs. Player bases ALSO provide a small amount of Safety/Health.


[05-Jul-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So with just 1 person on a planet, if you only want Pioneers....you can get away with building nothing at all. The single base will take care of growing a small pioneer worker base, slowly.

[10-Jul-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Whats up?


[10-Jul-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	POPI consumption


[10-Jul-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	built my SS just after the last POPR (by 9 hours >.<) but before its internal tick timer rollover


[10-Jul-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	I assumed once the SS was built, and I had something in is buffer to consume, it would upon its tick rollover, but it did not


[10-Jul-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	do I have to 1: wait until the next POPR for the station to be realized; or 2: full the entire internal reserve once before it consumes (say, DW to 500)


[10-Jul-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	any why in the holy good name of anyone, is the POPI consumption anywhere near the same time as POPR or even a multiple of it


[10-Jul-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	e.i., POPR hits for me at 1146CDT Thursdays, and consumptions are every 3 or 5 days at (does math)


[10-Jul-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	sometime at 0040CDT on those days


[10-Jul-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	*0400CDT


[10-Jul-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	the 3/5/7 day thing I dont care about (thats a lie, I do) but...


[10-Jul-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	the times...... *cries* WHY!?


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It doesn't exist until the next POPI.


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Note how it says Built 1, Current 0.


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	fantastic


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	POPI buildings only activate and deactivate on the POPI's. Since it's not active, the consumption tick is 0. Hence why it shows 0/0 for the next consumption.


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you ever want to "deactivate" a building, you'd need to. Which means you can't use extra POPI as upkeep storage without having a governor. Otherwise though...doesn't matter, just don't overbuild since you can't turn anything off.


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	...which means it wont count toward the upcoming POPR, which means it wont increase the happiness this week


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	d'oh >.<


[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

You will have to be (1) less than 60 days old to buy and (2) willing to pick them up at HRT yourself. PRO licence is required to send the buy contracts directly to me. DM me if you're interested.

**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR's not looking so good as I let the Comfort level slip too much. We're going for PF2 this coming week to address that, plus I've topped up our Zoo's upkeep to increase Comfort.


[15-Jul-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In slightly better news, we've reached my target of having Safety up to 50%. This will increase next POPR though as the new SST level takes effect.


[15-Jul-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	\o/


[15-Jul-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What do you mean POPR's not looking good? Popr looks fantastic. Happiness is the highest this week out of the prior 5, which means the rolling average is moving up. If safety is on it's way up too, then maintaining PF1 will result in migration in on Pioneers next week and will hold that nice and steady at the low unemployment marker.


[15-Jul-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Thanks for the vote of confidence lol


[15-Jul-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	However, the drop in TECs wasn't what I wanted so that's the 'bad' part


[15-Jul-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I can see that, although I think that will also be a self-balancing, self-resolving issue with the status quo. Last week was -41, this one is -24, next one should be close to a wash since need fulfillment keeps trending up. You should hit equilibrium well before you get anywhere near open jobs.


[15-Jul-23 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If I had to spitball it, you'll hit equilibrium right around 9% unemployment with the status quo.


[15-Jul-23 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	mmm equilibrium, another underrated B movie


[15-Jul-23 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I loved equilibrium. Plenty of times it felt like a Christian Bale led semi-knockoff of The Matrix, but it was still a great movie.


[15-Jul-23 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, the Matrix if you stripped out the whole "slaves to the machines" bit, lol


[15-Jul-23 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jul-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jul-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	The concentration of the resource


[25-Jul-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**quato**:	Does a higher concentration mean a higher efficiency for extraction?


[25-Jul-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes


[25-Jul-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**quato**:	awesome. thanks!


[25-Jul-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not on the actual efficiency screen....100% is 100% is 100% everywhere. It's what 100% would represent.


[25-Jul-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So 100% efficiency at somewhere with a higher concentration would be more than 100% somewhere with a lower concentration


[25-Jul-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, not all sources are equal. So an equal concentration of liquid water will provide more than an equal concentration of atmospheric water, which will provide more than an equal concentration of mineral water.


[25-Jul-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**quato**:	that's interesting are there planets that have liquid ores like liquid FEO?


[25-Jul-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jul-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm selling CM kits (without MCG) and basic prefabs for newer players at HRT. Prices will be pegged at 80% of CX Ask price at HRT. You will have to be (1) less than 80 days old and (2) willing to pick them up at HRT yourself. PRO licence is required to send the buy contracts directly to me. DM me if you're interested.

**kookookkookoo**:	How does surface landing matter when travelling?


[30-Jul-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Everything is on the surface. If you're not landing, you're not doing squat.


[30-Jul-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Then why do I have the option?


[30-Jul-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Basically, always land. The times it will make sense to NOT land you can count on one hand after playing for a year or two


[30-Jul-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Thank you for the help!


[30-Jul-23 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you could conceivably save some gas by not landing. Jump from an outer planet to an inner planet when their orbits are closest and don't land.


[30-Jul-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Then ride that planet around the system until you're closer to ANOTHER planet you really wanted to get to.


[30-Jul-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But if you're pinching pennies like that....you've got bigger problems.


[30-Jul-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	I have no idea how to do that


[30-Jul-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	I think I'll just fly normally for now


[30-Jul-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Exactly. It's an esoteric feature that you'll almost never need. Basically, just make sure it's checked and then never worry about it again


[30-Jul-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Thank you for the assistance! Also contact me if you are ever in need of fuel. I am new so I may not have that much fuel on me at a time. I'd also appreciate any tips you may also have!


[30-Jul-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Tips as in advice


[30-Jul-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just as an FYI, as a free player, you can only trade on the CX stations. No direct player to player trades except through the station.


[30-Jul-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Not even local market?


[30-Jul-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nope


[30-Jul-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you pay into the game at least once and then stop, you'll have access to accept contracts from the LM forever.


[30-Jul-23 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you've never paid at all...nope


[30-Jul-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Could you also explain reactor usage?


[30-Jul-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just a fuel spend setting. Minimum is the baseline. More is more fuel and more damage to go faster.


[30-Jul-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Specifically for FTL travel.


[30-Jul-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Actually it never occured to me, but now that you mention it, how do I set what type of fuel I use?


[30-Jul-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It does it itself. You don't spend FF while traveling in system. You don't spend SF while in FTL.


[30-Jul-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Do I have to load the FTL/STL onto the ship?


[30-Jul-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's loaded when you start with full tanks. But yes, on the FLT panel there's a button for cargo and a button for fuel. The fuel for moving goes in the fuel tanks


[30-Jul-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Thanks!


[30-Jul-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	How do I create H, TS and AMM?


[30-Jul-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	either you collect H (using a collecter, on a planet with H) or you buy it, same with TS (Extracter) and AMM (Collecter)


[30-Jul-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	but you need a planet that has those materials on it


[30-Jul-23 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Gotcha


[30-Jul-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	Not really an important question but it's more out of interest, what does APP stand for?


[30-Jul-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	another use for going to orbit on a planet is when you take off from a planet and 30 seconds later realize you forgot something important, if you cancel a flight, it will finish the current flight step, so that first step leaving a planet is fairly short (and uses a decent amount of fuel), but if you need to turn around, you can if your quick enough, same if you cancel a jump in other systems, you'll then coast to a planet in system instead of landing, so that you can set a new stage flight. this orbit does not exist on CXs (where I'm leaving the most and forget something, oh well)


[30-Jul-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kookookkookoo**:	good to know!


[30-Jul-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's one of the few niche uses for it, fixing stuff ups, on the other hand, if you don't make that mistake in the first place, well, it's not that useful

**ArcturusRex**:	@--SHAITR-- After much sweating over PRUNplanner, it looks like I'll be wanting to build 3xCLR, which would use 45 TECs. Would that strain Boucher's infra?


[27-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	popr says there are 96 unemployeed TECs currently, but their happiness is rapidly waning, so who knows if they'll stay


[27-Aug-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	perhaps as he said, donating to the wildlife part to raise comfort? 100% of its current output is apparently 20% of the populations need :(


[27-Aug-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	I'm still definitely a noob, so still learning about how population and employment works. Does "Workforce: Settlers 25 (399) Technicians 15 (8)" mean that building will only be able to hire 8 TECs?


[27-Aug-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'll boost the PAR inputs in the next cycle, and I already had plans to upgrade it


[27-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And yes, it means you can take up to 8 TECs and 399 SETs until the next Pop report, during which the workforce will be redistributed amongst those using them


[27-Aug-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd be more concerned if you want to employ ENG and SCI as I'm not putting anything in to support those (and am actually actively culling them)


[27-Aug-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you're ready to do so, building the CLRs right before POPR should gove you full staffing


[27-Aug-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Ah, I see. And the next POPR is in 6 days?


[27-Aug-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Is this where I should be looking? POPR FK-794b


[27-Aug-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes


[27-Aug-23 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Is the report delayed by one day? I see that the last report was 23h 57m ago


[27-Aug-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	it calculates once a week


[27-Aug-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	On Boucher, it calculates POPR on Saturdays, at 30m on the hours, this time for you all.


[27-Aug-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Aug-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	with the price differentials between NC1 and IC1, you could probably have them delivered to Hortus within a day or two.


[29-Aug-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	ya know, the thought didn't even occur to me to do so


[29-Aug-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	TSH.NC1 TSH.IC1 [x3, or more]


[29-Aug-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I mean, I would have just bought them, and used the difference between costs as escrow for shipping. 20k for shipping a tiny amount between CX's within a day would seem reasonable. But you can post a bid, it'll do the same thing, although it might take a few days, since people may be skiddish that the bid order will be filled before they can get a chance.

**Shorewahtevs**:	handful of shipping contracts are up on lm


[30-Aug-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when you start looking at higher tier items like TSH, production tends not to be local based, they have a rare material, or something, that might, but probably wasn't, sourced very close, and a lot of other inputs that mean a large decent chunk of the production probably wasn't local, I have mine at HRT because it's where everything goes, before I either use it or send it elsewhere


[30-Aug-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well, let's not rely on speculation, when we have nifty features through the APEX leaderboards -- if you scroll down to the bottom most category, you can search for those who are currently producing commodities of interest.....


[30-Aug-23 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	TSH for example, the leader rn (buffer CO GOB) has a production which entirely dwarfs the competition. They're based around Moria, and it's periphery with Benten.


[30-Aug-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most of the input materials are fairly easy to find throughout the verse. PE, AL and SI are trifiling easy to produce, even without extractor operations. The bottleneck is with BE Berylium, which requires and Advanced Materials Lab to be running (rather expensive), along with a PP4 to be spewing the final commodity out.


[30-Aug-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those last 2 things, along with the aformentioned market leadership, tell me that the company of interest is not only involved in high-end FTL ship manufacturing, but that they're also involved in A-fab manufacturing for end-stage HQ progression.


[30-Aug-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The particular BER Beryl Crystal planet of interest, for the party aforementioned, being XH-083C, being inhabited by one of their business partners, affording enough mineral supply to prop up 2, 3 permit PP$ bases yeilding net profits of 170k NCC daily, if turnover on sales is met.


[30-Aug-23 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That net profit would be for each base, which is pretty close to being on par with EDC/IDC MM bases. I'm pretty sure that they're doing this as a market service, providing the crucial fabs necessary to start bases on High-temperature worlds, as the other market participants are doing it at barely break-even prices.


[30-Aug-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm probably mistaken somewhere, but those were far-out guestimates.


[30-Aug-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	BE isn't actually that much of a bottleneck for TSH really, my one base SE-648B (that after redesign cause I can't be stuffed running the numbers again for actual current numbers) with 3 EXT and 5 AML (running 5/7 of the time on BE) makes enough BE 2 WEL non stop making THP, which in turn is enough to run 13 PP4 with max experts and CoCG bonus non stop with on just TSH, note, my planet does not have a chem CoCG to support it, so BE is fairly easy to run, you'd use most of it in shipbuilding, etc elsewhere. At his level I'm sure BE starts to become a problem again, but just for enough TSH for others, BE isn't a majorly limiting factor, it's finding good places to set up that many PP4 , the fact he is up there on other Afabs as well means he has a very large number of PP4 running somewhere (probably more than one planets worth) and since all advance prefabs need lower tier prefabs in them (LBH in the base of TSH) he probably has a set up for them as well

**roganartu**:	@lastmikoi fyi you generally don't have to worry about contributing to planetary infra or programs, especially on large planets. It's generally the governor's job, especially on well-populated planets like this (and is usually at least partially covered by taxes, though some planets run at a loss)

[08-Sep-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	is it a faction contract?


[08-Sep-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	just type it into either using PLI [insert planet] or go to your ship and put the planet in and the flight plan will pop up


[08-Sep-23 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Waitwhat**:	Oh perfect! Thank you, I'm assuming that's how I buy construction materials as well?


[08-Sep-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	You have to buy construction materials at a CX, the closest one to here being Hortus, you can check the tab on the left for "CXL"


[08-Sep-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	You have to send a ship there to pick-up items and bring them back to planet where you want to use it


[08-Sep-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's alot of busy work.


[08-Sep-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Evolivolution**:	Heya, could someone loan me some money to get production going? I'm looking to extract some water, so ideally I'm looking for some contracts selling water with an early payment on some of them.


[08-Sep-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	How much water are we talking about, and how much per?


[08-Sep-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Evolivolution**:	I have RIGs for ~ 500 H2O/d. If you're willing to pay for 500 early I'll give 4 more contracts for 500 all at 20 per unit. Fullfilled over the next week.


[08-Sep-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	So overall it'd be 2500 H2O @ 50000 ICA?


[08-Sep-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Evolivolution**:	Yeah


[08-Sep-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If it would be easier, I could pay upfront for that and you can just send the water once you make it all :]


[08-Sep-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Evolivolution**:	That would be much appreciated. Can you send a contract?


[08-Sep-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	POPR's looking as intended, though we also gained 2 unwanted ENGs out of the increase in Comfort from upgrading the PAR.


[09-Sep-23 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I will do up PF1 for the next week to stabilize the population a little during the handover to Frosty.


[09-Sep-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Before the handover when the election ends, I'll also top up the POPI inputs to the max, except for FODs which I cannot source enough of. Will also top up the COGC once it's open.


[09-Sep-23 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I will not be handing over any money to Frosty as I've been running pretty close to the line by investing the surplus into higher-level POPI. What I'll do instead is keep some POPI inputs on-planet, and top up that good if needed.


[09-Sep-23 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just wanted to put it here because many handovers involve handing over some money, but I like to donate goods instead of the money.

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm selling CM kits (without MCG) and basic prefabs (BBH, BDE, BSE, BTA) for newer players at HRT. Prices will be pegged at 80% of CX Ask price at HRT. You will have to be (1) less than 80 days old and (2) willing to pick them up at HRT yourself. PRO licence is required to send the buy contracts directly to me. DM me if you're interested.


[10-Sep-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	right now ive finally managed to get up to 300/7days for a long term contract; soon im moving the FEO extraction + PP#s also on that base to another planet to buff up output  some more

**Frosty802**:	<3 thanks SCHAITR


[10-Sep-23 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I'm looking at producing some of the inputs myself as I have a lot of the chain already. Just need to sort out the logistics. Likely direct contacts to players that want them (thanks MysteriousWalrus) or LM ads paying well :)

**bazdakka**:	more likely that 5 buildings ticked over to need one more MCG each, it's why I just keep a stock of MCG at each base, top it up whenever it gets low


[15-Sep-23 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	MCG is cheap, and doesn't take up a lot of space (at least until you get over 1K of it anyway), so it's not a major loss to be sitting on it (plus it lets you try and buy it earlier, and maybe at better prices, especially if you go shopping among the various CXs)


[15-Sep-23 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Summary of finances: ICA 765,624.15 overspend. This is mostly due to the infrastructure upgrades (Safety Station and Warehouse), and unknown term period tax income. The Tax income from what I can tell is a bit sporadic so I'm guessing a lot of people have long time production queues. At work at the moment, I'll post the Google Sheets link later and on Unified Faction Operations - Boucher.

**Frosty802**:	maybe I should have stayed as a carbon farmer


[04-Oct-23 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you'd like C prices to fall, you'll just have to glass Avalon. It went up so much due to the agricultural surplus markets not being able to respond to a large increase in demand (this was a few months back).


[04-Oct-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Even at current C prices, the injected INC recipes are untenable, unless you've managed to secure some sort of bulk supply at a discount, hence C producers have to rely on the much slower 1-2 material input recipes, at much decreased production rates.


[04-Oct-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	C.IC1 HCP.IC1 MAI.IC1 GRN.IC1


[04-Oct-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's just my take though. Take it with a dash of salt and pepper.


[04-Oct-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I'd have grown the inputs myself probably if I continued


[04-Oct-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Majority of carbon farmers grow their own MAI and stuff. Look at the volumes on those plots. C has 10x the trading volume of MAI etc


[04-Oct-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Indeed, however the reason why I listed the agri commodity markets as a "surplus" is exactly for such a nature.


[04-Oct-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those who grow their own inputs will use such. Those who don't will refer for supply to the markets. However, all tools utilize FIO endpoints which rely on market data. There is a significant probability that those, who don't keep their own I/O spreadsheets will refer to FIO dependent tools to justify operational decisions.


[04-Oct-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And yes, this is likely the largest detriment toward the current aggregate data providers --- those who are participating in market dynamics are the only ones providing public information to the entire system, which is fed to those who use FIO-dependent tools like Prunner/PrunPlanner and every other third-party service.


[04-Oct-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	All the more revenues to you if you can secure non-public supplies of bulk inputs to your businesses.


[04-Oct-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However, to such, (since I experienced this myself), what can you offer to those willing to part with their bulk agri surplus? Instant liquidity in a very long-form game? It's hardly an adequate sale.


[04-Oct-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	To play devil's advocate, all of those partners are better off by taking all of those low-interest loans being proffered by those greedy, long-term, companies, to then be able to convert their surpluses into C,  or whatever, and thus come into direct competition with your products. What say you?


[04-Oct-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Yeah that's why I'm almost completely vertically integral in everything I do lol. And I'm a very very basic kind of player cause I don't even use FIO/Prunner etc external tools, so I'm sorry but I have no valuable opinion here.


[04-Oct-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Vertical integration is nce when you want to completely isolate yourself from market forces, however, you're going to be losing potential productivity on such strategies.


[04-Oct-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Vertical integration is great in the late-game, however in the early-game, you want as much capital as you can get your hands on to expand for the increased gains in parallel production.


[04-Oct-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However, at a certain point, your shipping capacity will be stifled by that strategy.


[04-Oct-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	There is but one difference between the game economy and real economy: the fun factor ;)

**lastmikoi**:	I'm hitting a wall shipping wise, any production increase will make it so that I'm import/export starved by the round trips to IC1. What's the most reasonable path of action ? I've looked into shipbuilding but the prices are steep.


[07-Oct-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can contract your shipping needs out to others on the LM, though you can also see many of us do that so the competition is there


[07-Oct-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	Aye, the shipping activity on the LM was also a factor in motivating me to shipbuild, since my main activity is fuel production, it would make sense to integrate vertically into shipping


[07-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm not sure whether shipping can really pay for expansion since the profit is marginal to me


[07-Oct-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you're talking about upgrading your ships though, it'd depend on what you intend to haul around.


[07-Oct-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	well upgrading from 500t/500m³ holds to 2000t/2000t cargo bays with large fuel tanks would be really helpful


[07-Oct-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	but I've tried to look at each component's CXM


[07-Oct-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	and there's not enough volume to properly estimate pricing


[07-Oct-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	and I'd love to get a third ship, but that's even pricier


[07-Oct-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm working towards offering cheaper ship upgrades for newer players but that's still quite a few weeks away


[07-Oct-23 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	One alternative you can consider is to upgrade to WCB instead of LCB - that means you do not need a new CQx, which is one of the things driving the high cost


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	if I go for medium tanks and cargo bay, I do indeed double my shipping capacity (including extra fuel shipping)


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	without going over the threshold from CQS to CQM


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Instead of MCBs, I'd really recommend WCBs instead. The cost increase is negligible, and you have some flexibility in what you haul


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	going from MCB to WCB doesn't seem to trigger a threshold either indeed


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	E.g. you will be able to haul 10k RATs from HRT to MOR to sell


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	aye, I'm just used to hauling H and other high-volume cargo


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	getting my hands on a LFE will certainly be a challenge :)


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you could wait a few weeks I could provide it :)


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm ramping up to build QCRs now and my ELP should have some bandwidth to build an LFE


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Alternatively, you can check out the GTU prices


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lastmikoi**:	From the looks of it I'm expecting a few months of operations to be able to invest in it anyways, so it'll work out, as long as I'll still be considered a new player by then :°


[07-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I second using WCB instead of LCB or MCB for your ship upgrade, for the same reasons Schaitr has already mentioned, if you want a new ship, a LCB ship is a good idea, but for ship upgrades, WCB is the way to go in my opinion (you'll eventually find a use for the extra tonnage and it saves another upgrade down the line, and it's not much more expensive in the meantime)


[07-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i suggest having at least 1 WCB in your fleet, it makes hauling metals and other heavy things much easier.


[07-Oct-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	and its possible to get the upgrade installed on a starter ship for cheap, aka no to few secondary upgrades needed


[08-Oct-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ooo, new convo's. I'll start from the top. When I started out in this game, I think I've spent the initial 2 months or so figuring out the general game mechanics, the layout of regions and of the universe, industry plans and whatnot. My initial plans took on many forms, however I was eventually of the opinion that, at a large enough expansion, I'd need more ships of one form, or another, to keep up not only with exports, but with all the little jobs as well.


[08-Oct-23 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However, the need of ships is a bit of a misconception. Players eventually will need logistical capacity between their bases and the local CX, however this capacity need not be your own. As a BASIC licensee, you can countract out your entire shipping workload at the CX's LM. It's a very good option as you'd be pushing out any shipbuilding for a couple of years, however you will be dealing with the toil of the contract market, with its numerative postings, low visibility of shipping information, and whatnot.


[08-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If, for whatever reason, you'd be wanting more ships, I'd suggest considering two strategies. But as a caveat first, running more than 2 ships at any point in time requires consistent pro-licensure, otherwise you should just rely on contract jobs.


[08-Oct-23 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Now, due to the nature of shipbuilding, you can make some rather cheap GEN (STL only) ships for use within CX systems, or you can incorporate the more expensive FTL ships, with all of their additional components, for much greater cost, but with a far greater reach than just the local CX system.


[08-Oct-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That doesn't mean you can't mix and match. In fact I recommend such. Using GEN ships for say Promitor, Avalon, Helion Prime, Odysseys, and Hydron (For Hortus CX), will make all of your FTL ships be able to do everything else, like Berthier, Adalina and Boucher.


[08-Oct-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ahh, yes, the whole WCB cabal. If you're going to be exporting/importing lots of bulk, like more than 2k t, daily to a base, or I/E between CXs, then go for them. Otherwise just go for the MCBs. My bases get cleared out of their export inventories usually several times a week since I stacked permits, but if you're not dealing with unnecessary demand, your warehouses will eventually reach a steady state of average capacity. I'm not touching WCBs, or LCBs for that matter, due to my operational needs never needing them at my current stage of expansion, and they sort of detriment STL and FTL performance.


[08-Oct-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That's just my opinion. Discern your plans well, since they will affect you for a long time.

**Greed_McTavish**:	^ I feel you on that. I'm having trouble transitioning to an effective, profitable 3rd base. Several suggested HYP on prom, but sourcing the materials seems like it would really cut into profits. So, as a vict, I produce water here, ship to prom and ava, output rats and DW and I feel stuck. Not sure if I should prioritize ship 3 or start up a different career path for base #4.


[17-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	we're building up fk-794c as food processing, and fk-794d as agri, with fk-037c next door doing chem for NS


[17-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	with the amount of water required already, plus expansion plans (join us, you know you want to), being able to drop a few STL-only ships here made sense ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[17-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	re the INS concern, it adds <500k to the base cost, so <250k every 3 months. Easily worth it compared to moving the water further. fk-d is a bit worse with also low pressure, but doing everything in-system is pretty nice

[21-Oct-23 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	yes


[24-Oct-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	But I think C is better than RAT on this planet


[24-Oct-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	and yes


[24-Oct-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	early on in the game, you're going to wanna use as little fuel as you can though


[24-Oct-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	besides, the time savings to fuel ratio gets a lot worse past 25-30%


[24-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	You could be spending thousands extra for only 10 minutes saved


[24-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	potentially


[24-Oct-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AaronT**:	Going to wait till i have a full cargo hold before I send anything to be sold, just checking how refuelling works


[24-Oct-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I usually just keep fuel at my bases or in a warehouse at the exchange


[24-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	that wayI don't have to take up precious cargo space on my ships :)


[24-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AaronT**:	I'm producing fuel rn so ideally it would be full of fuel haha


[24-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	oh well then there ya go !


[24-Oct-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AaronT**:	ill use the warehouse tip though thanks!


[24-Oct-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Of course, enjoy your journey :)


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	@P-Money another possibility to consider is tearing down all RIGs on Promitor, and importing all H2O from Boucher


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	That will give better COGC alignment, and thus higher volume, if you can manage the shipping


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I'm going to have my ship upgraded in 2 or 3 days so eventually I should be able to handle the shipping


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I have 5 rigs on promitor


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Then there's the choice between making DW right on Boucher, or transporting H2O to Avalon. I actually do both, since the amount of H2O spewing out of Boucher rigs is kind of unreal, and it helps to shrink some of it down to DW before transporting away


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	When making DW directly on Boucher, you get better yield if you don't use PG. Then you can go for fewer FP and more RIGs


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I never use PG


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	well there you go


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	I am struggling to keep my Avalon base supplied so I'm definitely going to start pumping out DW and COF


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	that'll help keep Avalon fed


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	Promitor produces enough water to sustain my farms and then a little extra, but not really enough to export it to avalon


[24-Oct-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArcturusRex**:	Right, but adding a Boucher base changes the picture significantly


[25-Oct-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greed_McTavish**:	^ Agreed. Boucher H20 output is insane. I'm starting to do the math on whether I can simply produce enough water to sustain my 100% farms on prom without actually providing basic consumables for the employees

Either way happy with the direction, we are starting to see more engineers. Upkeep for them is very expensive and there's limited supply so I'm looking at production options. Warehouse upgrade is a couple of hours away, SST will be upgraded this coming week.

**faultofdaedalus**:	hello, sorry i didn't say hi when I joined, so saying hi now!


[13-Nov-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**faultofdaedalus**:	i've set up for fuel production, currently slow going. kinda wish there was a water electrolysis recipe, for splitting hydrogen and oxygen out of water.


[13-Nov-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's a thing that people commonly wish for hahaha


[13-Nov-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I also do some fuel production here :]


[13-Nov-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**faultofdaedalus**:	nice! how's it been going?


[13-Nov-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**faultofdaedalus**:	i'm also thinking of setting up a base on 794a just to farm some hydrogen. so i at least don't have to buy that


[13-Nov-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	None of the planets in this system have significant enough Hydrogen deposits to justify extracting from here I believe


[13-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Just the fact that you see it listed in resources doesn't mean it's worth extracting. Always check on https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch how good a planet actually is before settling.


[13-Nov-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**faultofdaedalus**:	ok! thank youu

[14-Nov-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	There are some folks who just do h2o, steady means of income.


[17-Nov-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	People produce h2o and hydroponic farms will produce crops


[17-Nov-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LosLebos**:	I am quite new and decided to convert roughly half my H2O to DW directly on Boucher, because else I cannot transport it all (DW weights roughly 60 % less). Also DW price is very high right now


[17-Nov-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

**P-Money**:	I need some stuff H2O shipped to the Hortus system. Either Hortus Station or Hortus - Avalon. Either way, message me or send a shipping contract if you have cargo space to fill :)


[08-Dec-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	If you need stuff hauled, it's you who needs to send a shipping contract, not the shipper.

I'm slightly concerned over some increases in prices but will monitor before raising taxes back to previous levels, but just a heads up.

[17-Dec-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	it looks like you tried to buy under the market price, your gonna have to buy at the lowest sell price (red in order book) if you want it instantly

[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Breakfast**:	so if i havnt upgrade my HQ< i wont even be able to utilize the 7th building?


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SDRainbow**:	Not really, just make the order bigger so they take 1~2 days.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SDRainbow**:	then you can stack them easy. If you wonna go the monney route. With pro you can make orders recurring.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The orders will just keep cycling - the 6th and 7th buildings will work on the 1st and 2nd order queued after the first 5 are in production


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	@Breakfast next time ask those questions in the help channel, you'll get more accurate help. It's obviously untrue what SDRainbow said, all your buildings will work normally.

[26-Dec-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	oh okay


[26-Dec-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but he said ship was leaving in an hour, and that was about 4 hours ago, so I think I missed it, oh well, not to important anyway, I can just route one of my ships for it instead, it was coming out this way soon enough anyway

**Vention**:	@bazdakka, in 23h I'll have a ship departing HRT->Boucher, and it'll have at least 250t/m3 spare space. If that time frame and capacity works for you, I can carry whatever you need brought in

**Frosty802**:	All good things must come to an end. Chow Trading has balanced the books and we start this year at a balance of ICA 0. Taxes have retured to previous levels with the exception of ENGs, I have raised them from 500 to 700 to cover increasing upkeep costs.


[31-Dec-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Thank you Mr Frosty :]


[31-Dec-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Interestingly, taxes seem to be calculated the moment an orded is put into the queue. Therefore those week-long orders that you queued but haven't ran yet will still start with zero fee.


[31-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Not to abuse Frosty's generosity of course. Just saying ;)


[31-Dec-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	huh... i wonder if that works with the reocurring orders too


[31-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	currently i have a one queued, so atleast ill know in 2 days


[31-Dec-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	The same: recurring order is nothing else than an order that schedules a copy of itself upon starting. If that happened when taxes were still 0, it will cost 0 as well. Look at your queue details to confirm.


[01-Jan-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	It'll likely balance itself out, I still had a ~90k payout yesterday due to those long time orders starting before I zeroed it. I'm not condoning tax evasion :p


[01-Jan-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'm still getting taxes from Circa, despite not being governor there the past two months


[01-Jan-24 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Those long time orders are wild :p


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	two MONTHS?


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	holy crap what kind of orders are THAT long?


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Only got 900 NCC...still odd


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'd assume it's someone that went inactive with degraded factories making some sort of ship part or something, otherwise I can't explain it


[01-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	hmmm... i can see that, heavily degraded while missing some basic consumables


[01-Jan-24 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	odd that the taxes are not paid to the current governor


[01-Jan-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	They are, its just depending when the order was queued who the govenor was and what the taxes are. I think its just how it deals with it internally.

**Frosty802**:	Best place to ask for help/questions is in the global chat or the help chat rather than the planet chat, unless its specific to this planet.

**Ketamincat**:	ok :(

**masonwater**:	repeating orders do infact reset to the current tax


[03-Jan-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I'd of hoped so otherwise I would have a tax problem from my generosity!#


[03-Jan-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Of course they do. That's exactly as I said: the value of the tax is calculated upon scheduling the order.


[03-Jan-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Aye - if you go the route of queueing 20x orders of H2O before hand, that's the most someone can do to take advantage of it :p

[05-Jan-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Am_morii**:	Thats why it took me way more money to build the base


[06-Jan-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Frosty802**:	Bit of a growth demand for pioneers so will run Planetary Festivities 2 for another week. Budget sitting at ICA ~1.2m overspend, this is expected as I purchased everything at the start of the month. Tax payout was a little lower than expected, likely left over from the Christmas tax break but could be from increased costs for obtaining Engineer pop-upkeep resources.

**Am_morii**:	If anyone needs carbon I have 68 that I am selling at askers market price so 526 Ica each one


[10-Jan-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Am_morii**:	Nevermind 48


[10-Jan-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No one really uses Carbon here so you might want to make it more attractive since we have to ship it away.


[10-Jan-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Am_morii**:	I will sell it below market price


[10-Jan-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Am_morii**:	like 500 Ica


[10-Jan-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just saying, I don’t actually need any.


[10-Jan-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	wow, lots of new people this week


[13-Jan-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	One of the common things I've noticed with newer players within the last few big waves was that Boucher, Katoa, Etherwind, and Harmonia are really popular choices. Whatever the reason may be


[13-Jan-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	For starter planets - Katoa, Vallis, and Harmonia definitely


[13-Jan-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Montem became less popular for some reason


[13-Jan-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Indeed, I would say it is due to Vallis having a more new-player 'friendly' CoGC, but..new players can't really tell that when starting out


[14-Jan-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Hello new people!


[14-Jan-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	I'm happy with the new population report, almost completly filled Engineers, should be good at next cycle and then hopefully naturally Scientists will increase as well.

[19-Jan-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	What do the numbers in () mean next to my current workforce?


[19-Jan-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That's the amount given to you during the population report from the planetary reserve pool


[19-Jan-24 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	After the population report ends, most of which become part of your workforce permanently (until you destroy the buildings) and you can get more population


[19-Jan-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Though that shouldn't be an issue with pioneers on any starter planets :]


[19-Jan-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**P-Money**:	Water is both "wet" and not wet


[24-Jan-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	For something to be wet, a liquid has to interact with the surface and adhere to it, but colloquially "wet" is used to describe a liquid that makes something damp. As in: "I could feel the wet on the papers"


[24-Jan-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	and in that case, wet refers to the water on the paper


[24-Jan-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**P-Money**:	So both sides are technically right


[24-Jan-24 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You'd have the most luck Boucher -> HRT. You could also probably get Boucher -> ANT, then BEN


[27-Jan-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It'd definitely work, just how long before someone takes it up


[27-Jan-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RayKowalchuk**:	There's a company named Tch-inc whose Managing Driector is named 62. I click on their name and a red buffer comes up that says "No user for input [input]." I can't submit communication to them.  Is this person real, or a bot? They have 11 bases, including on Boucher.


[03-Feb-24 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I assume it has to do with their username


[03-Feb-24 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-24 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Same, "No user for input {input}."


[03-Feb-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Huh...that one works for me


[03-Feb-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	COMU 62 results in a "CONVERSATION 62" buffer but message "Nothing found."


[03-Feb-24 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	It opens a functional communication window?


[03-Feb-24 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	wiiiiiild


[03-Feb-24 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	oh, I had an extra character - now it's working


[03-Feb-24 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	941c1530e6adbdd81fc53f96519b2ff4 seems to be their user ID, so it should work in place of '62'


[03-Feb-24 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	If I click on "Contact User" it returns "Nothing found."


[03-Feb-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-24 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Perhaps...


[03-Feb-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I sent them a message :p


[03-Feb-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Definitely not a bot?


[03-Feb-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think just 'unfortunate' name


[03-Feb-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	All sorts of weird things that can occur, like getting an error when clicking on their name or...not being able to mention @--SCHAITR-- in chat properly due to the symbols acting up

**MoonSugarTravels**:	That's so thoughtful. Now I knew I voted for the right person for this job.


[08-Feb-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It would be funny if the devs integrated a planetary radius function to be the parameter for a resource reserve. The more ppl that extract, the small the planet gets over time, thus reducing the availability of public plots.


[08-Feb-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Per the last economic report, the universe as a whole produces 520k units of H2O per day, on average. This is 104k cubic metres, or 0.0001 cubic kilometres. Boucher's volume is about 2 289 345 000 000 cubic kilometres. Assuming 0.1% of Boucher's volume is water, and the entire universe's production were located here, it would take us 600 million years to extract 1% of Boucher's volume.


[08-Feb-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I don't think we'd live long enough to see this feature remove even a single plot from any planet in the game lol


[08-Feb-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	(Oh, of course I meant: 600 M years to extract 1% of Boucher's volume *of water*. So 1% of this 0.1% of its total vol.)

[08-Feb-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Considering earths radius is 6.371 km and 15 to 20 km are solid crust there is just so so much matter making up the planet


[08-Feb-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	tbh im early game and bad at math, so smaller orders like 200 DW for 70 would be enticing when im between contracts


[09-Feb-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	driving to HRT is so expensive and time consuming, and i've never produced enough to pack either ship. mostly sailboat fuel


[09-Feb-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ketamincat**:	can't you just... wait for more things to accumulate?


[09-Feb-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Yeah when I first started, id go more than a week without shipping anything to the CX, and that was starting on Prom. You should let it build up a lot before you ship from here


[09-Feb-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	At least a full starter ship worth


[09-Feb-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	i end up having to ship a full WCB (3kton/1km3) every 3 days to cx


[09-Feb-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	i /could/ have waited, but with a single rig and no income i sent both boats out and just did a bunch of shipping orders until i had enough for more


[09-Feb-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	if you want to go into shipping, i can give you a few pointers


[09-Feb-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Also if you are doing shipping there are almost always going to be other players with a bit of extra space who will prob offer you good deals to bring your stuff to the CX


[09-Feb-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ya, i usually end up with 300-500 extra space in my ships, usually use that for contracts or corp shipping


[09-Feb-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Same, I dont have enough production yet to fill my ship


[09-Feb-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	designed mine to not use the full ship, that way the contract pays for the trips


[09-Feb-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	And people always have stuff that needs to go form Boucher to Prom


[09-Feb-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	Prom is not too OP.


[10-Feb-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**HuntianaJones**:	I am thinking about leaving for a while, (keeping enough stuff to start back up my main base if I wanted to) what would anyone think about a raffle (10k per entry) and the winner would receive the entire pot plus around 5 million NCC worth of materials. DM me if interested, drawing in one weeks time.

**HuntianaJones**:	for interest, im more just downsizing to just my one active base and just leaving the rest with enough to start them again, so not exactly quitting, more like just slowing down to checking this like once a week instead, if that makes sense Zipatsu

[05-Mar-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**2035Brad**:	Is there a way to see how many of each type of profession are located in our Boucher System?


[05-Mar-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	LM and other private contracts are a PRO-only feature. The best option for you is to transport your fuel to HRT and sell on the CX there.


[05-Mar-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	There's no easy way to figure that out. You can click each base on each planet map and read what the main industry is, but that's... hardly convenient. For more game-related questions, head on to the HELP channel which is more populated and you'll get answers sooner :)


[05-Mar-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**2035Brad**:	Thanks MoonSugarTravels :)  Only been here a day and will probably upgrade to Pro soon if my first experiences are positive.  Looks like the Devs have done a good job.

[07-Mar-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	you can build rigs to extract H2O, and then if you feel like you want more H2O but dont have any more space here, you can put a base on another planet and get more from there!

**2035Brad**:	G'Day Boucher Team,  I am exploring the opportunity to expand my fuel processing business here on WWB.  I have one Pioneer, one Settler Habitat and one Refinery,  I costed the next expansion to be about 130000 ICA and will result in building of an extra pioneer, settler and two refineries, and Rig here on WWB.  Is anybody interested in helping a newbie out with a loan?  In return of favourable conditions, I would like to develop a relationship that offers STL and FTL at the Hortus bid rate of the day.  Thoughts or suggestionss

[28-Mar-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	If you're looking for developed hydrogen places, I'd suggest Hydron in the Hortus system, if you're looking for something closer, there's some undeveloped places in JS-572, like JS-572f, JS-572h, and JS-572i

[04-Apr-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**2035Brad**:	I believe so.  It has made my game easier and I don't mind supporting the Developers.  I do hope that the renewal price gets cheaper as we stay in the game longer as a reward for all those who make the effort to keep the game fuller.


[04-Apr-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm offering (1) cheaper basic prefabs (BBH, BDE, BSE, BTA) and (2) the materials needed to set up a new base (LSE, LDE, LTA, PSL, TRU but without MCG). Prices will be at 80% of HRT Ask prices and pickup is at HRT. You must have PRO license and be under 90 days old. DM me with what you need, and I'll check whether I still have stock.


[12-Apr-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Apr-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	@LaenUnder Some quick napkin math, assuming 2 of my 2k/2k ships running full time and prices at current AIC market rate I'm spending about 21,000 AIC on ship repairs, 240,940 AIC in fuel and 868,560 AIC in supplies per month for a total of 1,130,500 AIC for my 72 rigs. This results in about 140k H2O or 4,326,000 AIC before costs and 3,195,500 after. I did forget to take production cost into account so give or take 45k ish

[15-Apr-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**2035Brad**:	Some great suggestion for game development there !!


[15-Apr-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmosMoses**:	so... from the free player for 6 months, free playing is like solitaire with people talking to you. In 6 more months, based on progress so far i expect to have my 2 basic ships upgraded to large bays and 6 500 acre bases. at that point, if the game is still interesting, and to be honest a one year solitaire game can be a drag, i will be ready to consider pro. from the pont of view of a business model, that is a poor advantage system, and commercially the company behind the game should worry a lot, but professionally i am a marketer and as far as I can telll there are no such on the business side of the game =)

**GaryXean**:	I've always been a free player, and I honestly don't mind it. Sure, I wouldn't mind having a bigger fleet of bigger ships, but I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything


[16-Apr-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep no sympathy at all


[16-Apr-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	also i don't think this site survives off of sub money. there are no ads, minimal free license restrictions, and the ones that exist seem to be full of tools for impatiently disorganized players (me) or incredibly successful players.


[16-Apr-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	if anything it feels like we're helping build interfaces and workflow management systems by filling it out with space economy data of our own making. which i think is very cool and neat, and would love to use this interface elsewhere if that's one of the goals


[16-Apr-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NotPeaK**:	Main reason I was fine buying one of the supporter packs, to me it was just like I was "buying" the game and getting to help support the devs so it was win win :)


[16-Apr-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	really, FREE is challenge mode, you have limited shipping, and can only trade at CX. theres no LM when you mess up, and no shipping contracts when you grow to big. You have to plan more and try to find stable COGC planets for your builds.


[16-Apr-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	what i always say, if you dont like the game as FREE, there is nothing in PRO that will make you like the game. FREE is like the distilled essence of the game.


[16-Apr-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	FREE can surprisingly stretch far into an empire, see people with multiple years playing as full F2P, the big thing is doing the planning to minimize shipping while maximizing profit.

[20-Apr-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@big_mart you're looking at a 20k shipping fee just to bring whatever you purchased over there (huge giggle btw) over to Hortus space.


[20-Apr-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that's at bare bones fuel prices btw. you can probably get away with posting like a 15k AIC shipment on ARC <--> ANT, and then a 7k shipment on ANT <--> HRT. Most shipping to/from Arclight will likely be full, one way or another. Idk what the shipping market is like there, since I'm not there yet.


[20-Apr-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gasgano**:	@Darth_Merkel realistically, probably rarely anyone brings full ships to Boucher, so when someone flies here is either to get a full ship of their own stuff or ship someone elses, so the price is not to high if flying here just to ship for someone


[06-May-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Darth_Merkel**:	yeah of course, i just seem to remember shipping 500t for 10k, and when i wrote it there were offers for 250t for 10k

**marchioro**:	I'm not sure what the usual shipping rates are around here, but since there is a lot of demmand, my guess is that it's higher than what I'm used to seeing elsewhere. I just copied the only rate I saw locally, let's see fow attractive it is...


[27-Jun-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	I have one ship in the area myself, I tend to post orders when I'm in transit elsewhere


[27-Jun-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ppl used to ship large quantities around Hortus space on the LMs --- most of that vanished, with alot of cargos doing direct to Mora/Antares for the past several months.


[27-Jun-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	My guess is, that it's a little bit of both ship buildup, and private outsourcing of shipping requirements.

**Darth_Merkel**:	Yeah, i usually try to provide some, but since i've got my 3rd ship i have less and less oppertunities to, blessing and a curse in a way xD


[28-Jun-24 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Public shipping conts usually pertain to the COGC industry evidenced. For instance on FK-794b (here) it's all Resource Extraction, and hence full-export.


[28-Jun-24 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not eveyone does RE production here, but the mainstay is Water/Carbon production. You might get imports every 90 days, but those are exceedingly rare, since most production lines usually have an excess of export material that needs to get to Promitor, Avalon, Hortus CX, or elsewhere.

**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	i was about to ask a stupid question, then i went to the forums to read first... so lets me try to rephrase my question:


[02-Jul-24 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	we have approx 204 bases, which means we should have a parliament of 5, but since no ones run for those extra seats, its as if we're still running on the old system


[02-Jul-24 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	with the only added benefit is we can *see* the actions the govenor does, despite the fact theyre still 'unilateral' so to speak


[02-Jul-24 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	so the question is, are we still restricted to running for parliament in cycles in a situation like this


[02-Jul-24 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	and i ask this purely as a hypothetical; i approve of all of @Frosty802 's actions 💖


[02-Jul-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	So I believe its been the same for all planets, the status quo has just continued and at the next cycle the Parliament will be elected, hence the Parliament of 1 on all systems until the next election ends.

[08-Jul-24 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	That's just the nature of food processing bases.  The inputs have more mass and volume than the outputs, so there's less shipping needed out than in.

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, I'm running but it's solely in hopes of landing a parliament position to explore how that works and dip my toes into the political management side of things. Not that I'd expect to actually land governorship even if I were serious about that.


[08-Jul-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Frosty802**:	I don't think anyone has been particularly vocal about being part of the parliament for Boucher, there is quite a few people running. I'd say vote myself, Schaitr, and MysteriousWalrus at least, us three look after some large pop planets in Hortus space (even though Boucher is technically outside it), so have a good idea how to run them, but always welcome to new minds!


[08-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm down to make a genuine go of it, mostly to see what it's like, but having said that I've also gotten the impression that how the sausage is made is pretty public anyway.


[08-Jul-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Well I for one am excited to see how this new system is going to turn out. It'll be interesting how the upkeep is maintained between parliament members, whether it goes to effectively the Governors responsibility and the others are just financial oversight or it gets shared between parliament members.

[19-Jul-24 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	To allow for more data calculation and thinking time, we are tabling the tax re-reform and population tier strategy update until August. We all appreciate residents inputs and welcome your comments, hopefully trust in this parliament hasn't been affected too much!


[19-Jul-24 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frosty802**:	Whatever happens I've already produced POPI requirements for another month so we have roughly 2 months of all the tier supplies anyway.


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you would have liked some data, you could have just asked me. :); But as far as the publically available data on FK-794b goes, here's what I could grab from APEX.


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Out of 199 currently developed plots for the planet, the following are void plots (or plots that generate no revenues for the government): 10 are Null Industry (depreciated Pro -> Basic players who didn't want to maintain logistical loads to/from here, but are devoting permits to maintain the plot in the long-term), 4 are Corp HQs, and 6 are PPS reservations. Of the remaining 179, here's the actual industrial spread, that I don't want to model: 6 are devoted to Agriculture (FRM/ORC bases); 1 is devoted to Construction (CO RCC); 1 is devoted to Electronics (CO GTR); 12 are devoted to Food Industries (FRM/HYF + FP + RIG hybrid plots, per my experience); and 10 are devoted to Fuel Refining (GAL deposit on planet + a TS deposit a few jumps out). Of these numbers, around ~5 are in the process of being fully constructed, or torn-down.


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The remaining 149 plots are all devoted to Resource Extraction. I would hope that they are all doing either H2O extraction, or C processing, but you can't be all too sure, that everyone is playing as efficiently as possible. Of these numbers, around ~15 are in the process of being fully constructed. Hence, with the above assumptions, being at a density of ~75% of potential tax collection, should arrive at a figure between 930,496 to 990,528 ICA of expected, minimum, weekly revenues, at a very high confidence interval. These are, of course, at current LR rates (the tax reforms did pass, and are still on the books).


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For the majority of you all *points his finger enthusiastically around the room*, that amounts to roughly ~4,500 ICA per week on a single permit, or 9,000 ICA on a triple permit, weekly in terms of government contributions, since there's no other fees, at all. [Those withheld from this model are likely contributing a bit more, on average, due to potential multi-permit bases, and higher population tier usage, that I can't determine on APEX directly.]


[19-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I did this as a jest, since I'm bored this morning. But I would like so see some weekly revenue figures, just so that I can compare those, with the figures that I provided. :)


[19-Jul-24 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jul-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you'll just have to let the current admin decide if they want to pitch in towards any new POPI buildings/upgrades.... Beyond that, there's the gateways that were mentioned, being in development, to be released sometime in the future --- but we don't really know what they'll require, only guesses.


[21-Jul-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	As for front-funding, just let the slush fund build-up, and have your politics be as transparent as possible. Most projects however, are deficiency-driven, since taxes/fees tend to be set to the lowest standards that are possible. Some places may have wierd settings, that are much higher than you'd see otherwise, but they're usually running some form of deficit.


[21-Jul-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Nothing's stopping anyone at all from dumping upgrade/upkeep materials into POPI/PPS, but unless you see some from of motion, in the GOV buffer, describing what they rebate, you probably won't get anything for such donations. :)

[04-Aug-24 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But since [SYSI FK-794] offers RE, AGRI, and FI COGCs, via FK-794b, FK-794d, and FK-794c, on paper, the best gateways to install would be for HRT, MOR, and ANT, respectively, as out-bound pathways, for FTL travel.


[04-Aug-24 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You'll still need in-bound pathways, at those respective endpoints, otherwise things would end up, as one-way-only "roads", and you'll want to gather support for your cause, in those areas as well, since places like FK-794 will have similar competition, in other systems, for #free-real-estate, since there's only so many planets, and potential connections, on these things.


[04-Aug-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cosmomomo**:	im building up FK-794a juuust in case the system needs more developed planets for infrastructure. sure, it's more expensive! but it takes the same time to transfer from FK-794b to FK-794c, which could help if we ever get cut off, or need to expand locally.


[04-Aug-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@cosmosmono --- if you want to build up, just drop the rest of the PPS stuff (COGC +LM). Focus on other things, if the planet is needed by a bunch of other people, it'll then start to get used.


[04-Aug-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And no ADM, plz.


[04-Aug-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Skahletto**:	does anyone here ship water? i need a steady shipment of water to oz-189c biweekly, if so please message me :)


[07-Aug-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you'll have to charge more for that.


[07-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you're bypassing HRT. It's a long day down from HRT, and a longer way up past HRT, to Curie.


[07-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I hope you can pad out that shippers ladings, in both directions, and not just 1.


[07-Aug-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	What volume are you looking at moving, @Skahletto?


[07-Aug-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, that's gonna be a tough sell given that water is pretty much pinned on the HRT market, and anyone solely doing shipping can pick up 20c/u contracts pretty easily from here to HRT.


[07-Aug-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If it's you generating the Curie-> Prom shipments, you might be able to convince someone to run you water up from HRT with those assured as the return leg.


[07-Aug-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's hard these days, in pricing out one-way shipments. Between a planet, and a CX, or from a CX to CX, it's usually like 7-8k per 500t/m3, each eay. Of course, hoping for less, just makes me ingore your offers.


[07-Aug-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	way*


[07-Aug-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I mean if you can hook-line-and shink shippers, it's not my problem, but for us that ship, we have far less margins than your efficient COGC + expert bases get, and our ROIs per 2k t/m3 ship, are more dismal, than if we'd invest everything into more base permits.


[07-Aug-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Being more competitive, against your LM counterparts, especially at HRT station, will only get you, all the more attention.....


[07-Aug-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Of course, I can't tell you what to do, only what others, would be willing to go through. :P


[07-Aug-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	that being said, any of you wanna be a shipper from HRT to curie? lol

**Roh**:	Yeah, who knows. the HRT hub is just to get you far more visibility, than say FK-794bs LM will afford. You can try the usual 7->8k ICA per 500 t/m3 standard as a trial. You may need to adjust to higher payouts if no one takes it. It's a general approach --- use market incentives to your advantage, and people will be incentivized to pick them up, if they can.

Low stress, no interest loans are available for new people (this project is how I got my start in the game three months ago) and profits are split weekly, paid out in the consumables the group produces (working out to a pretty consistent 50k/d profit per base).

[18-Sep-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	really funny to look at the 180d graphs of H2O.NC1 etc haha


[18-Sep-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Fair, I'm happy with the golden age of cheap affordable H2O having lasted as long as it did but my buy orders were starting to take on average about 2 weeks to fill up to 70-80% whereas my sell orders were picking up pace to the point where they started to get bought out by others who would just relist it for more


[18-Sep-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Glad to see you’re still around. I had to raise the prices on HRT or I’d suffer the same fate


[18-Sep-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Sorry Schaitr :p


[18-Sep-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	As my main goal is to supply cheap affordable H2O to those who need and actually use it seeing it get flipped for more bothered me a bit as it went against the intended use of it.  Prices might rise for a bit but I aim to eventually supply MOR and ANT again, though it'll be with reasonable affordable H2O rather than cheap affordable H2O as 31/u clearly was a bit too ambitious to maintain with the growing demand ^^


[18-Sep-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I’d guess that the cheap H2O caused many to build their business plans around that price without extracting any themselves, which also caused the lower supply overall.


[18-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We might well see a growth here and at the other H2O planets :)


[18-Sep-24 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Well, hopefully not on Phantasm 🤮


[18-Sep-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	It's a bit of a long shot but by not listing anything for a while I hope that those who did stock up on H2O will start listing it on the CX now and as you said maybe attract some more players towards the H2O extraction business which would end up naturally keeping the prices in check


[18-Sep-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	I'll list some on MOR / ANT if it ends up running out to prevent a scenario where there's no / overly expensive H2O


[18-Sep-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But more as a failsafe than a market maker at that point


[18-Sep-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Yeah ^^


[18-Sep-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Did also try to supply BEN but I only have one base in the Arclight region assigned to it, which drops off the H2O on ARC and then relies on whoever picks up those ARC - BEN contracts to move it


[18-Sep-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	Sadly, the player who shipped most of that quit playing a while back so I don't think I can realistically cover BEN anymore which is a shame but it was more of an experiment to see if I could supply 3 CXs at once to limit the arbitrage buyers on the main 2


[18-Sep-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	If you're constrained by shipping capacity, why not buy more ships? If cash flow is a concern, I'll trade you a ship for H2O.


[18-Sep-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	@Zipatsu, I didn't mean to oversell it, but I guess I did.  I mainly knew you from your impressive CX presence, so I was imprecise with my language.  Glad you aren't *gone* gone!

[19-Sep-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	The shipping was just for the ARC > BEN trial, I've thankfully got enough ships for my regular routes at the moment but I do appreciate the offer of getting one for H2O ^^


[19-Sep-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	The main constraint I'd say would be HQ levels, I've almost got all the materials ready for the next base but that's been about 1600 Afabs already which even at discounted prices still takes a bit to save up for through H2O sales. Whereas before I could add another base or two to improve the production right now it takes a bit more time to ramp up. I'm committed to keep it going as best as I can though


[19-Sep-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zipatsu**:	@Filefolders No worries, didn't take it serious and really just wanted to make a fun comment ^^

[28-Sep-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@Dzentak, from my calculations, we can afford to keep the current pop trajectory without changing anything (-900 PIO and SET next POPR), then run a PF1 the following POPR (+1.8k PIO, -350 SET).


[28-Sep-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	This is to reduce the SET unemployment bubble as much as possible so the POPI doesn't get wasted on these bums

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi everyone, I’ll like to ask for your vote so I can be governor. My plan (as on other planets I govern) is to reduce unemployed so our tax dollars are spent only on those pops we need to support.


[30-Sep-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	What you may not also know is that I started governing here in Boucher, and Frosty took over from me when I went to govern Prom instead - that is so far back it doesn’t appear in the planet ADM history any more. Hope you’ll support and vote for me :)


[30-Sep-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	^ I'd appreciate your votes - but I have no doubt that Schaitr knows how to manage this planet properly


[30-Sep-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	SCHAITR is the man.


[30-Sep-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoonSugarTravels**:	Vote SCHAITR, he knows what he's doing


[01-Oct-24 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Oh, don't get me wrong. Got no doubts about the ability, just wasn't sure if it was a matter of desiring the post or more motivated by duty. If was the latter, coming up with a transition plan for a bit down the road would make sense.


[01-Oct-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	On the other hand, if it's more out of desire, that's not so much an issue.


[01-Oct-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	On that note, got any parliamentary picks, Schaitr?


[01-Oct-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, I could make some guesses about the likely ones, never hurts to ask though. Appreciate that. Figured I'd toss my hat into the ring, see if folks think I'm Water Board-worthy.


[01-Oct-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Been wanting to get a firsthand look at planetary administration anyway, since it seems likely I'll be doing it out in the hinterlands eventually.

[02-Oct-24 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Pomme most of the gov things get looked into via Archiel's GOV sheet (third party resource)... It's a maths thing for minimal weekly requirements per planet. After that, it becomes a politics thing, with who gets reimbursed, how much the taxes will get set, et.c.

**CoinCrafter23**:	any idea why?


[13-Oct-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	fuel prices were previously capped by the admins using NPC sell orders(market makers)


[13-Oct-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	they raised the price on those, so now fuel is more expensive


[13-Oct-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It's a pretty simple base to run, though, so I wouldn't be too surprised to see the price come down some as people get in while the getting's good.  We'll see how it shakes out.


[13-Oct-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	my 3 permits on boucher produce more than 5k water per day, so it's a hassle even shipping it to HRT sometimes


[13-Oct-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PurpleOrange**:	shipping your H2O to HRT costs ~6000 in fuel. A LCB cargo load will net you almost half a million at H2O.IC1


[14-Oct-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-24 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Actually, my immediate advice would be to restart on Promitor as that's the easy start.


[10-Nov-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you still want to stick it out here, it's not difficult but shipping would become a more immediate concern since the exchange where you can buy/sell goods is at least 1d3h away

[10-Nov-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	just keep this in mind... If you start off on Promitor, you'll be locked to expansion only around HRT, until you get more ships (like lots more).


[11-Nov-24 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	My own first base was on Promitor... My second was on Phobos --- I basically cut myself in half, while only having the 2 starters, with no upgrades, and yeah, it was a painful first few months.

**Roh**:	Well you're only vaguely pointing out 1 principle. There's quite a few in my re-telling of early game experiences... So which one?


[11-Nov-24 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You literally just stated one problem, that starting on Promitor limits one to the vicinity of Promitor.  That's the principle to which I refer.


[11-Nov-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	1) Logistical capacities; 2) Shipping spreads over regions; 3) Divided revenue streams; 4) Long-term planning


[11-Nov-24 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Those are all variations on the same problem (limited shipping capacity), and they all apply to any given starting location, so I stand by my initial statement.  If anything, Promitor is located more centrally than Boucher, so your warning seems out of place.


[11-Nov-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Josh_Glass**:	bruh lmao


[11-Nov-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Promitor is objectively a better start as you're more towards the core and cannot get a spot on it otherwises - Starting on Boucher means you have even harsher logistics. But starting on *any* planet will require a bit of work as you expand, it's not just a Promitor thing(?)

[14-Nov-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**thabichi**:	whats a good base setup for this planet


[22-Nov-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Rigs. Rigs as deep as you care to stack 'em.


[22-Nov-24 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Maybe throw in a FP or two and bring in some PG.


[22-Nov-24 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	35 rigs, 1 STO. Plant a base on Epicier with a stack of FP and make DW, or one on FK-794d with a stack of HYF and make whatever.


[22-Nov-24 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	@Arkantez HRT <-> Boucher shipping is rather one-way. Doesn't take much to keep a stack of pumps running here, so either flying back full loads of water, DW/processed goods, or HYF output and deadheading on the inbound leg.


[22-Nov-24 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hizumi_Mizushiro**:	35?!?!


[22-Nov-24 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Josh_Glass**:	definitely not


[24-Nov-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Josh_Glass**:	not worth it at all


[24-Nov-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Josh_Glass**:	just depends on how close youre shipping it


[24-Nov-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Josh_Glass**:	for example i had a three permit rig base on danakil and it just ended up with 100s of thousands of water on it because it was too out of the way


[24-Nov-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Storage > Min/max, the longer you play Prun.


[24-Nov-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Cuz, you're no longer chasing the 0.00001% of added value per week, rather you're wanting convenience to just keep your bases running. When you've got dozens of ships, and dozens of planets, and dozens of CX/LM orders, the "workflow" starts to add up.


[24-Nov-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But that's just my take. Others are probably still chasing the min/max approach anyways.


[24-Nov-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	72/2 is my setup also


[24-Nov-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Is it optimal? No. Considering I don't sell raw water, however, it's a hell of a lot easier for me to have my DW and H2O needs met without requiring any intermediate transport.

Good chance I'll have it in stock and can just patch you over until the shipment arrives. No charge, just issue a cont to send back the same amount upon borrowing.

[29-Nov-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We have more than enough buffer. I'm getting rid of the SET bubble, which is costing us POPI inputs to no gain.


[30-Nov-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prisma**:	Fair enough, it was just surprising to see us loosing PIO


[30-Nov-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The base number (194k) is still large enough that even with the relatively low unemployment %, we have 7.4k unemployed. That's enough for 7 1-permit full RIG bases so I'd say we're still healthy.


[30-Nov-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Once the SET gets a little lower, I'll be adding the PIOs back in

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Actually...


[07-Dec-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Most of my holdings are over around here, so I'm doing pretty regular ANT<->HRT loops. You need anything for your Boucher base in the future, just LMK. I'll probably be willing to do the same kind of swap.


[07-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i don't produce BSE myself anymore so i just buy it off HRT CX and LM ship it in


[07-Dec-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i give generous rates (imo) though so i'll let you know next time i cont out a batch


[07-Dec-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Fair enough. LMK a bit in advance, my Deimos base gets me a split from the DNPC so I may just be able to toss you some well below market.


[07-Dec-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Still in a stocking cycle from my latest series of expansions, but eventually I should end up with a surplus, I think.

[07-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Oof.


[07-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	they're #1 on LEAD for it even


[07-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I snagged one of the Deimos spots when they started opening up but didn't have a near-future plan for it, so the slot opening in the cooperative was quite fortuitous.


[07-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Making me glad I've only got one base that needs INS.

[08-Dec-24 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	generally if you want a product delivered to a planet for you, the rate should be above CX ask


[08-Dec-24 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But in that case I am buying the product? I would like someone to ship my own h2o to Avalon. Howmuch ICA / t should I put?


[08-Dec-24 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	8-10/t in-system is about standard


[08-Dec-24 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sorry I was thinking this was Avalon - you want Boucher to Avalon....10-15/t


[08-Dec-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I used to LM ship often from Boucher to HRT, until I built bases here


[08-Dec-24 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	You end up needing any consumables or repair supplies in the future, LMK. I'm generally open to spotting folks a few units of whatever to make up for shipping oversights.


[10-Dec-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Potchama**:	Thanks, I will keep that in mind.


[10-Dec-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Dec-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SamuraiThunderduck**:	I run a 3 permit rig base here, but I’m kinda outside my own logistics capability atm for shipping. Saving up for a 3rd ship.


[11-Dec-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I largely stopped taking LM conts - though have still looked and noticed a few of my regular clients have not been posting shipping ads as frequently....I recently scaled back all my multi-permit bases and added like 6 new bases in rapid succession, so been tied up with my own logistics....will have five new ships in the next couple months so should be able to support LM shipping again.


[11-Dec-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Same. Not that I'd been doing a ton of LM stuff for a while, but I started sourcing some of what I was buying off the LM elsewhere and have been overworking my entire fleet just to move the stuff I need to move around. Only leg with any capacity is the same HRT->Boucher leg that everyone runs mostly empty anyway.


[11-Dec-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Unfortunately, this game mirros irl industry dynamics too closely.. At a certain company size, you've going to have to outsource many things, since you just don't have the revenues. After that point, you'll start to grow your own capacities, diversify, leverage your revenues/capital through loans, et.c.


[11-Dec-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Before that point... yeah you'll pickup the small shipments that you have capacity for... But shipping is largely a #bottom-feeder market, since everything is trying to offer the lowest prices/costs for transport, and it's entirely a third-party player decisions of.... Do I take up this hassle, for a few quid, or just leave it on the LM?

**worvand**:	huh interesting, ask the question in the forums, get the devs responce


[20-Dec-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there is a period of time after a coliq before you can coliq again, with each subsequent restart, the waiting period gets longer. If you see a liquidated company on a planet, you might check the activity level of the player (more than likely "inactive")


[20-Dec-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not all "liquidations" are COLIQs... I'd bet many are just inactive deletions, which run off a database script, once your account his their parameters... Your account won't get "deleted", rather your game instance will. REF: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/faq/index.html#how-often-can-i-coliq

**Roh**:	Mmm, SETs will never be culled on Boucher, since we're PIO heavy, and education rates to #next-tier status depend on previous-tier POPR densities.


[22-Dec-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	More inputs from PIO --> SETs... Less output from SET --> TECs.. So you'll never have less SETs on Boucher, unless more people re-tool their PIO bases into TEC / ORCs.. and happiness for TECs on Boucher is boosted.


[22-Dec-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's a non-issue, imo, since monthly POPR figures mostly depend on who's doing what on the planet.

[01-Feb-25 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-25 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

The government tried creating a black hole to dispose of it, but it got clogged. As the amount of fluid grew, it became its own planet. Finally, they just said "eh, let the farming nuts deal with it". And so our great ocean was born

[14-Feb-25 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**itsRobbie**:	speaking of rPrun, can you use both rPrun and PMMG extension at the same time?


[15-Feb-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	no


[15-Feb-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	rPrun supercedes PMMG


[15-Feb-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	rip


[15-Feb-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	is it better?


[15-Feb-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	In basically every way


[15-Feb-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	the only thing it doesn't have is the XIT INV command


[15-Feb-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	that's it


[15-Feb-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	everything else is just better


[15-Feb-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	also PMMG is no longer being updated


[15-Feb-25 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	Really? Hmmmm. I like pmmg's burn buffer a lot and the order book being on the side of the order page. Does it have those?


[15-Feb-25 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	oh and being able to sort by BRN on base inventories


[15-Feb-25 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	oh I didn't know it wasn't being updated anymore either. that sucks


[15-Feb-25 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	it has all of that, and it does it *better*


[15-Feb-25 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	rPrun was forked off of PMMG's codebase


[15-Feb-25 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	i think


[15-Feb-25 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	It literally has every PMMG feature barring XIT BURN - I'm not kidding


[15-Feb-25 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	make sure to export your PMMG data before upgrading


[15-Feb-25 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	but you absolutely should


[15-Feb-25 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	it has a superior contracts interface


[15-Feb-25 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	I love XIT CONTC


[15-Feb-25 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	it shows me a nice little list of conditions on contracts that I have to fill out


[15-Feb-25 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	interesting. I'm looking at right now. pmmg feels like home though so I might just ride it out until something eventually (?) breaks lol


[15-Feb-25 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**itsRobbie**:	at it*


[15-Feb-25 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Tonatsi said everything but XIT BURN, but he meant XIT INV.  XIT burn is still here, and it's displayed more compactly too, which I've come to prefer.


[15-Feb-25 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	OH YEAH


[15-Feb-25 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tonatsi**:	I meant INV


[15-Feb-25 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-25 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Epicier is a local food industries planet. Avalon (HRT) and AJ-293a are both ~1 day away (and a day from each other) as well.

**Zipatsu**:	Welcome! \o


[17-Mar-25 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I pump water here, run hydroponics on FK-794d, and run food processing on Epicier.


[17-Mar-25 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Processing it to DW here isn't terrible if you don't have the shipping to move that much water around.


[17-Mar-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I get water here, bathys, rc-639a, & etherwind; FI at Sand, Epi, Avalon; farm and hyf in BEN and Verdant


[17-Mar-25 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	everything else is either support/self supply or cash crops.


[17-Mar-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	generate @ 10k water per day across the four bases

[18-Mar-25 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm good with my numbers, I'm not doing water exclusively - besides, I'm only trailing you by 2 positions on LEAD


[18-Mar-25 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm also still under a year in, so still a rookie.


[18-Mar-25 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Damn, I am only in position 3 now? Maybe I have to pump up my numbers


[18-Mar-25 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-25 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	1yr v 4yr, why are your numbers so low?


[18-Mar-25 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rento247**:	@Tonatsi was a former governor of Promitor. Dunno if I was a king technically, but then again, there weren't any of these parlament stuffs going on back then, so I guess my rule of governance was more dictorial back in the day ^_^'


[15-Apr-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Tonatsi**:	Did you wipe your account? It's not very old


[15-Apr-25 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
