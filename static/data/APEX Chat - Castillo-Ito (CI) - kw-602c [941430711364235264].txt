**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Thanks for people's vote!


[19-Jan-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Thx for taking over. Just ask if you need anything. Sent you a golden DW contract to provide some cash for first buys for supplies.


[19-Jan-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Thanks a lot for that and for keeping everything stocked after you've taken your decision to move on from your position!

**Erisea**:	Hmm, I've just built a brand new base here.  Any ideas why my pioneers have zero satisfaction?  I have all the consumables.


[07-Mar-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Oh, never mind, I know why...


[07-Mar-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I believe the poor little PIO bastards DEMAND food, water and a hovel to live in... Honestly, you'd think supplying work to help them fulfil their life's purpose would be enough.


[07-Mar-24 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Next they will want breaks and holidays too!!


[07-Mar-24 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Nah, I was giving them food, water, clothing, even coffee and extra comfy clothing.  I'd just forgotten to build them a house...


[07-Mar-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That would do it. At -12.73 degrees, living outside would be mildly uncomfortable.


[07-Mar-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	If they worked harder, that would keep them warm!

[26-Mar-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	why there is 2 people voting for agri COGC?


[26-Mar-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	*sees dead soil* we should totally grow crops here


[26-Mar-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	some people build a lot of hydroponics farm that don't use the soil


[26-Mar-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm thinking of bumping up the cost of production runs for anything besides resources or food production to encourage developpment


[26-Mar-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	works fer me :)  There are plenty of other Agri CoGC's around the area to plant HYF's

[30-Mar-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	isn't it a lot cheaper to do farmsteads? we got nemesis and proxion pretty close by


[30-Mar-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	@KingBR trolls gonna troll.


[30-Mar-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Farms are cheaper but much less productive. Companies eventually reach the size where volume trumps ROI


[01-Apr-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Oops, accidentally shipped off ALL my DW and RAT, so production has slowed to a crawl.... Small buy orders on the LM if anyone can help

[03-May-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Althasandrian**:	I just got a mission for governorship and KAWA has a good support network for governors. I could take over.

[27-Jun-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I would like to endorse Althasandrian for governor once again. He's done a good job of upkeep in the past month and I see no reason to change governors again so soon.


[27-Jun-24 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I would ask your support to getting on the council to help and support the governor in his efforts.


[27-Jun-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Althasandrian**:	Thank you for your support. I would also like to ask for support for Anpache as third member of the parliament, he has helped me with supplies occasionally for the upkeeps.

**capi3101**:	Howdy, y'all. I want to thank those of you who supported my bid for planetary government. I honestly had been aiming for parliament rather than the governorship, but as I've been elected to the top spot, I will so my best in the role for all y'all.


[30-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	(Spoken like a damn politician...).


[30-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Written. Whatever.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	So my immediate concern is going to be getting the technician numbers up; if y'all have looked at the POPRs lately, they're leaving in droves. I have the CoGC upkeep inbound (arriving tomorrow) and will get the upkeeps for the safety stations and infirmaries dealt with as soon as I can manage it.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	And then we'll take it from there.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**capi3101**:	That POPR did ~not~ go as planned...


[23-Sep-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	I'll do my best to try to get the number of technicians up these next few weeks, assuming y'all still want me as governor.

**Anpache**:	Does anyone who is already here have plans to increase their base size in the near future? Need to figure out if we just need to build a good buffer or if we should be ready for planned expansion


[24-Oct-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Probably should plan for more folks. We still have a lot of open land here. We probably could back off a little bit on the SST POPI. PAR's a tougher read. INF is probably where it needs to be until the settler unemployment goes down.


[24-Oct-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Keep some extra DW, FOD and SOI on hand and worry about refilling those depending on what the tech unemployment looks like next POPR.


[24-Oct-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Planet's making money and the treasury is healthier than some of the larger worlds, so there's that too...

**superbadsounds**:	So this is the only unnamed planet I have any sort of plans to be on long term. Anyone mind if I name it? I was thinking "Sonos Malum" to stroke my fragile ego


[29-Nov-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I don't mind it being named, and if you are paying for it, it's your choice. If you want Latin phrases though, i got a few suggestions

[30-Nov-24 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	a posse ad esse // Amor fati // bona vacantia // capax infiniti // compensatio morae // compos mentis // de fideli // doli incapax // esse est percipi // festina lente // hic et nunc // ira deorum // justitia omnibus // labor omnia vincit // mare liberum // mobilis in mobili // pons asinorum // res nullius // stamus contra malum // terra nullius


[30-Nov-24 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Little better. Anyway, just suggestions, Sonos Malum works just as well


[30-Nov-24 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Pons asinorum is a personal favorite, means "bridge of.. donkeys" but like the other name and I'm not getting flagged for profanity

**SilentReaper**:	Hello fellow food producers. FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs.
