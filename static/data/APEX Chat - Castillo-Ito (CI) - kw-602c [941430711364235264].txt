**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Thanks for people's vote!


[19-Jan-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Thx for taking over. Just ask if you need anything. Sent you a golden DW contract to provide some cash for first buys for supplies.


[19-Jan-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Thanks a lot for that and for keeping everything stocked after you've taken your decision to move on from your position!

[07-Mar-24 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Oh, never mind, I know why...


[07-Mar-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I believe the poor little PIO bastards DEMAND food, water and a hovel to live in... Honestly, you'd think supplying work to help them fulfil their life's purpose would be enough.


[07-Mar-24 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Next they will want breaks and holidays too!!


[07-Mar-24 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Nah, I was giving them food, water, clothing, even coffee and extra comfy clothing.  I'd just forgotten to build them a house...


[07-Mar-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That would do it. At -12.73 degrees, living outside would be mildly uncomfortable.


[07-Mar-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	If they worked harder, that would keep them warm!

[26-Mar-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	why there is 2 people voting for agri COGC?


[26-Mar-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	*sees dead soil* we should totally grow crops here


[26-Mar-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	some people build a lot of hydroponics farm that don't use the soil


[26-Mar-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm thinking of bumping up the cost of production runs for anything besides resources or food production to encourage developpment


[26-Mar-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	works fer me :)  There are plenty of other Agri CoGC's around the area to plant HYF's

[30-Mar-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**caskman**:	isn't it a lot cheaper to do farmsteads? we got nemesis and proxion pretty close by


[30-Mar-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	@KingBR trolls gonna troll.


[30-Mar-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Farms are cheaper but much less productive. Companies eventually reach the size where volume trumps ROI


[01-Apr-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Oops, accidentally shipped off ALL my DW and RAT, so production has slowed to a crawl.... Small buy orders on the LM if anyone can help

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I would like to endorse Althasandrian for governor once again. He's done a good job of upkeep in the past month and I see no reason to change governors again so soon.


[27-Jun-24 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I would ask your support to getting on the council to help and support the governor in his efforts.


[27-Jun-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Althasandrian**:	Thank you for your support. I would also like to ask for support for Anpache as third member of the parliament, he has helped me with supplies occasionally for the upkeeps.

**capi3101**:	Howdy, y'all. I want to thank those of you who supported my bid for planetary government. I honestly had been aiming for parliament rather than the governorship, but as I've been elected to the top spot, I will so my best in the role for all y'all.


[30-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	(Spoken like a damn politician...).


[30-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Written. Whatever.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	So my immediate concern is going to be getting the technician numbers up; if y'all have looked at the POPRs lately, they're leaving in droves. I have the CoGC upkeep inbound (arriving tomorrow) and will get the upkeeps for the safety stations and infirmaries dealt with as soon as I can manage it.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	And then we'll take it from there.


[30-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**capi3101**:	That POPR did ~not~ go as planned...


[23-Sep-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	I'll do my best to try to get the number of technicians up these next few weeks, assuming y'all still want me as governor.

**Anpache**:	Does anyone who is already here have plans to increase their base size in the near future? Need to figure out if we just need to build a good buffer or if we should be ready for planned expansion


[24-Oct-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Probably should plan for more folks. We still have a lot of open land here. We probably could back off a little bit on the SST POPI. PAR's a tougher read. INF is probably where it needs to be until the settler unemployment goes down.


[24-Oct-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Keep some extra DW, FOD and SOI on hand and worry about refilling those depending on what the tech unemployment looks like next POPR.


[24-Oct-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Planet's making money and the treasury is healthier than some of the larger worlds, so there's that too...

[29-Nov-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I don't mind it being named, and if you are paying for it, it's your choice. If you want Latin phrases though, i got a few suggestions

[30-Nov-24 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	a posse ad esse // Amor fati // bona vacantia // capax infiniti // compensatio morae // compos mentis // de fideli // doli incapax // esse est percipi // festina lente // hic et nunc // ira deorum // justitia omnibus // labor omnia vincit // mare liberum // mobilis in mobili // pons asinorum // res nullius // stamus contra malum // terra nullius


[30-Nov-24 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Little better. Anyway, just suggestions, Sonos Malum works just as well


[30-Nov-24 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Pons asinorum is a personal favorite, means "bridge of.. donkeys" but like the other name and I'm not getting flagged for profanity
