**Endrius**:	the great rations purge


[26-Sep-21 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	at least prox has plenty of rat to go around


[26-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Endrius**:	dude with +800 rations pulled out it seems, weird


[26-Sep-21 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	A little embarrassing that Moria can even maintain half-price RAT in addition to all their other advantages. I wonder how long this will take to normalize


[26-Sep-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	dem dudes who monitor LM whole day 24/7


[26-Sep-21 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Endrius**:	it is wild out here at Benten station


[26-Sep-21 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	what happened


[26-Sep-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	hello everyone :)


[26-Sep-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	i just filled the COGC upkeeps


[26-Sep-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	governor babysits the COGC as designed ;)


[26-Sep-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	put up a quick ad for 20 GRN if anyone's got some extra... works are stopped up waiting on a ship to arrive


[26-Sep-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	thank you!


[26-Sep-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Manfriendly**:	np :)

**KMF_Razgriz**:	Looking for H2O on the LM at 30/u.


[27-Sep-21 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	Proxion LM suddenly went dark


[27-Sep-21 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	so little contracts


[27-Sep-21 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Did you turn the filters off?

**Kubelo**:	do I lose materials I asked someone to ship when the contract is not fulfilled?


[27-Sep-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	yes, if you let it breach. You can extend the deadline if they just need more time


[27-Sep-21 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	that's kind of scary, if you let someone ship a lot of materials


[27-Sep-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	yes, the LM carries risks. Thankfully, the community so far has been pretty good in general about trying to honor their contracts.


[27-Sep-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Sometimes people accept contracts by mistake and that's a pain to resolve, or if the player COLIQs without fulfilling

[27-Sep-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	hence u can put restriction on the rating of the company you working with at LM. Since once you breach contract the ratings drops


[27-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	so probably best if you put A level if you wanna ship something


[28-Sep-21 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	```New Warehouse Slots are available on Proxion! Interestingly it doesnt give a message for that. So yea it just got upgraded, thanks to the contributors speeding that process up. Namely Razor :) ```


[28-Sep-21 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	Three lots of 50 RATs each at 68/u on the LM.

[28-Sep-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Dear Citizen, i am thinking about expanding the Warehouse again. The next upgrade would allow everyone to rent 2 Units, therefore up to 1000 m³/t in the warehouse. This might be interesting for newer players who cant afford a Storage Building yet. Please just voice your opinions if you would make use of that, if i would build it for you.


[28-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadPhoenix**:	i personally wouldnt. ive never been close to hitting storage cap. then again i dont keep large stocks of material.


[28-Sep-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	I'd probably use it just for the sake of being able to demolish my STO and cram another building or two in its place


[28-Sep-21 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yesplease**:	I'd like it!

**Zizzleswomp**:	Yay - Library!


[28-Sep-21 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	I dont think its that easy for you to reach max storage of warehouse at your own base as a new player


[28-Sep-21 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	especially since its been near 1 week I still havent reach 50% of my warehouse T^T


[28-Sep-21 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	probably only if you're on a heavy ore planet, but not here


[28-Sep-21 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	it adds up quick depending on what you store


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	if you made an INC base here you could load up on C pretty fast


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	oh, fair point


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	ehem


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	im a carbon farm


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	farmer


[28-Sep-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	soooo still not full since u are very near to benten to sell things


[28-Sep-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	my sense of perspective has been a little lost.  i landed on prox and immediately threw up 2 frm, 3fp, and an inc.  t's easy to forget how slow the very early game is


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	(i doubled most of that a week later, and the base was full after about 3.5 weeks)


[28-Sep-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hearth**:	ahhh i only have 2 farm 1 inc


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	yeah now i have 1 ext, 6 frm, 9 fp, 2 inc, and wpl


[28-Sep-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	think i need to ditch an fp or two though; my frm can't keep up


[28-Sep-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I bought my prox base: 9 frm, 8 fp.  Since I fly to phobos on the regular, I just do all manufacturing there.


[28-Sep-21 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Rain's base planner multiplies in the CoGC twice.  Check "RO-labor" column AC


[28-Sep-21 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	200 RAT a day, some HER for supporting MED, FIM for phobos Engineers, and some RCO for WPL on phobos.  And FOD for the Phobos PAR.


[28-Sep-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	yeah i'm the one who reported the bug in rain's sheet yesterday or the day before.  mostly because my prox farms were reporting wrong thanks to cogc doubling :P


[28-Sep-21 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i was hoping to get more C out of this base, but man that base area disappears fast when you try to multitask


[28-Sep-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	try making a base on etherwind instead


[28-Sep-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	and utilizing both cogc


[28-Sep-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	the resource extraction cogc on ether definitely helps with c


[28-Sep-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	along with all other bonuses that etherwind base carries


[28-Sep-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	can also move some fps over there and focus strictly on farms and stuff over here


[28-Sep-21 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	it bears repeating.  But thanks to you.


[28-Sep-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	agreed fuurin, i almost immediately started thinking about etherwind when i set up shop here and saw how fast i was going to run out of space.  def would be nice to offload even just the dw production.  and yeah totally bears repeating -- the link in the handbook now goes to the new version so if anyone's running rain's sheet it's worth updating to the newest version for a few cleanup items, including the cogc doubling


[28-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i also got in line for an stl ship from madnewmy, should have funds ready in a couple weeks.  with bases on katoa and umbra, having a benten system trawler will free me up to make another base i have to travel back and forth to

[28-Sep-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Is there an updated version with FIO integration?


[28-Sep-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Not yet.


[28-Sep-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	soon™


[28-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	I'm going to see about adding CSV endpoints for the data...maybe that will work..?


[28-Sep-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i wish you could just do a 'diff' on the formulas/script between two versions of the same sheet


[28-Sep-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	would make updating the fio version fairly painless


[28-Sep-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i think the .csv endpoints aren't going to be of too much help, since anything is going to require permission to access


[28-Sep-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	the cross-sheet access at least gives a prettier permissions ask


[28-Sep-21 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	actually if the sheets-based import source is fully public for read access, there may be no permissions ask at all -- was that ever tested?


[28-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	CSV endpoints requires access?


[28-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	any time you're making a call to a remote address


[28-Sep-21 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	boo.


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@derelict: Not seeing that


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	not seeing a permissions ask for loading a remote .csv?


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	that seems... dangerous


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	It's a CSV.


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	It treats all values as strings.


[28-Sep-21 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	hey, if it works then great


[28-Sep-21 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	I'm pushing /rain/prices/condensed/csv now.  I'm due for bed, though. In theory, this is all you need for price updates.


[28-Sep-21 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i would have assumed the permission was related to the http request, not the payload content


[28-Sep-21 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	So if you want to add that... :-)


[28-Sep-21 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	DI-PriceInput or whatnot.


[28-Sep-21 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	if i wasn't neck-deep in my own apexesque fiorest/prunner killer app ;)


[28-Sep-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Wyago may have you beat.  He got FIOExtension to show data _in a buffer_.


[28-Sep-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	but if i have a minute later i'll look ;)


[28-Sep-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	So excited.


[28-Sep-21 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	yeah i think in the long run it's going to be really hard to maintain a full featureset through exention-based injection into apex -- but happy to be proven wrong


[28-Sep-21 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i've been enjoying adding little polish to my interface though.  things like ensuring that the picker textbox is auto-focused when ctrl-space for a new buffer, etc.  it's been fun reverse engineering apex


[28-Sep-21 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	is wyago's solution running the actual apex internal code, or is he just emulating a buffer by writing new elements to the page?


[28-Sep-21 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Too tired to see, but it's in gitlab repo


[28-Sep-21 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	nite saga, i'll have a look, my curiosity is piqued


[28-Sep-21 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	I'm trying to keep awake to hit the "deploy" button once this build succeeds for CSV output.

[28-Sep-21 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	that's really cool.  very different coding style than i'm used to, i'll have to bug wyago about how he set it up.  it's definitely brittle though -- he's using generated class names to mock a buffer interface; if the underlying codebase changes those classnames could all be regenerated.  still it's an impressive addition to the extension, and happy to see it rewritten in typescript :)


[28-Sep-21 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	get good rest saga, if i get a chance i'll play with hitting the .csv endpoints from a fresh sheet and see if it skips permissions

[02-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadPhoenix**:	*mind


[02-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	5/m3/t work?  that's the old going rate.  i'll kick it up a bit for the smaller package.  but LST is not profitable enough to pay big shipping costs


[02-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadPhoenix**:	ah, you too on LST XD


[02-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadPhoenix**:	ill take it


[02-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	actually this is an FTL trip (even if short), so i'll kick it up a little


[02-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Corlis**:	i will start buying DW and RAT for the next upkeep


[02-Oct-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	i kind of wish there was an infra upkeep 'bank' so if i wanted to donate, say, thousands of PE in a shot because i had it to spare, it could sit in a silo to be used for upkeep over multiple periods.  or even just if i had some to spare but it was already filled for current upkeep, i could still donate for next upkeep.


[02-Oct-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Corlis**:	From these numbers i was deriving that the art gallery is the next best Population infrastructure, this should get us in happiness of population to quite high values


[03-Oct-21 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	The DW ADs are for public funding of the art gallery.


[03-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	If anyone wants to participate he can accept one of these ADs, the Art Gallery is roughly 425k in total costs, therefore its around 28k per person if I can get 15 people. Currently we are already at around 10 people who want to join this common fund for the Art Gallery.


[03-Oct-21 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	For those unfamiliar about what i am talking about:


[03-Oct-21 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	I don't know an exact threshold, but keep an eye on the efficiency of that production line associated with that building to determine the best time to repair.


[05-Oct-21 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	<70% efficiency with or without bonuses is typically where I get my ish together and buy the repair supplies.


[05-Oct-21 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bla_Razor**:	likely stating the obvious here, but if you ever happen to fly out of MOR with any free space, just load up on FEO (goes for pennies there) and you're guaranteed to sell it for double the price at BEN

[12-Oct-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Corlis**:	Dear PrUner`s of the Universe,  The time has come to educate the masses and build the first University of the Universe.  Proxion is set up for pushing the last steps towards Scientists, for which the University is essential.  As with other Population Infrastructures on Proxion, this is gonna be another crowd funding campaign.  So far we sucessfully funded a Wildlife Park Level 2, a Library and an Art Gallery this way, making Proxion the most developed planet of the Universe.  The University is set to cost 1.300.000 CIS (or 1300k CIS). Which is derived from mostly FOWL sourced prices and discounts.  We also will invest the required DA software for a very cheap price into the production of LU, which are part of the University build costs.


[12-Oct-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	How will the campaign run? I will post on Proxion golden 1 DW sells for 25k CIS, 50k CIS and also some AIC and NCC.   Investments of 25k+ will receive mentions and honorary membershipcards for the University.  Investments of 50k+ and higher will get access to afabs, rfabs and engineer based products, as far as we can make them, roughly at comparable price levels.  To advance even more high tech projects, ideally on Proxion of course ;)


[12-Oct-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	I also have to apologize for abusing the LM for that


[12-Oct-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kubelo**:	how should those be calculated then?


[20-Oct-21 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	It should be 14 FF for Prox to Ben


[20-Oct-21 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	but anyway, using 150 SF, and 70 FF Prox->EW, you should get a cis/t/m3 of 5-6


[20-Oct-21 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	12 is way to much, unless you are using to much fuel


[20-Oct-21 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	so I guess I've been cheated by default fly settings


[20-Oct-21 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	didn't bother experimenting that much with them, though


[20-Oct-21 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	yeah, don't use the defaults

**PalmTree**:	I am looking into what I need to start a new base.  Do I need to construct a storage module, or does a new CM come with some storage space?


[24-Oct-21 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	I recently created a my first new base, it does come with 1500t/m3 storage capacity


[24-Oct-21 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PalmTree**:	cool - thnaks


[24-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Dear friends of Proxion,  once again i call upon you to open your treasuries and continue the development of Proxion.  The University will be finished in the coming days. (looking at you Kiripin)  With the current development and growth of Proxion the treasury of Proxion will focus on expanding safety support for the massive Pioneer base.  Thats should be fine for the moment. However, the scientist project requires support to continue.  Many thanks here to Joronimo and the FOWL development fund, which was taking over the costs for some inputs for the gallery.   For the coming weeks, we got 3 projects which we should tackle:


[24-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	a) more passive education by doing a second LIB (850k) b) A third Wildlife Park (350-380k) for more Comfort. With the BRM supply pretty fluent, thanks to Astosman and Bla Razor, who settled a BRM planet in the XH region and import into the BEN region. I will prepare the HAB in the background, which takes time, therefore this isnt the most urgent project. c) A second Art Gallery (500k), due to the fact that its realatively easy to feed with the existing electronics chains provided by FOWL and MKM. Many thanks to everyone involved here.


[24-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Now my plan here would be that we get a LIB up first, which boosts engineer education even further.  The PAR is relatively fast to make when the HAB exists, so we are a bit more flexible there. If anyone has access to HABs, please reach out with prices, then we dont need to double down on that. BRM is highly requested. The Gallery can be temporarily fed with an additional input to slightly increase our culture values, but that will only suffice for 2-3 POPRs.  As done before with the UNI, i would offer again 25k and 50k support packages. If anyone wants to commit a different amount, just mention it.  Any support on the A-fabs is very much welcomed :) Also i want to say thanks again to PiBoy for helping me big time with all these EPO :) without that only half of the projects would be possible.


[24-Oct-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Also i have to apologize for hijacking the Local Market for the golden DW ADs for contributions. They should disapper quickly


[24-Oct-21 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	If anyone has questions to details here, feel free to reach out. I got statistics, graphs, cost sheets and so on :) always happy to make everyone understand how it works

Feedback on POPI in this universe
Wanted to throw out some feedback on POPI now that we’re building some of it.   POPI not starting until the POPR after you build it is kind of rough, sometimes it takes 2 weeks to see your any effect from what you build. The fact that PIOs consume Culture and Comfort is a problem - planets with high pioneer counts require more technician related...

**Ritteruk**:	@Carlosuss do you mean the SST and INF that Corlis refers to above? If so it is not something for a new player to concentrate on, short version is there are certain attributes that have to be kept high for the planet to keep growing which the governor (Corlis for Prox) keeps an eye on.


[31-Oct-21 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadPhoenix**:	Does anybody need something shipped from BEN? got 319m³/355t of space left. Planned departure in ~3,5h

**Carlosuss**:	The vast time scale of this game is dawning on me


[02-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	i already love and hate it

**Kubelo**:	so ask away and don't be afraid to restart your company if you feel like you've made mistakes


[02-Nov-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	i'm happy with my start.. jsut need to chug up the money to get another rig to speed things up


[02-Nov-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	I did it twice and only on the third run I had a general idea and a plan for the nearest future


[02-Nov-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	oh, you started with a water rig here?


[02-Nov-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	although i was i went for a more adventurous company name


[02-Nov-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	yeah saw the water and slightly fertility


[02-Nov-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	unfortunately water extraction on prox isn't really profitable


[02-Nov-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	it enough to keep my farms up and running?


[02-Nov-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	It's more a matter of that you could make a lot better returns on the money it costs to build and run a rig if you were to just buy h2o and instead put that money into more farms


[02-Nov-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	makes sense


[02-Nov-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	If there is an H2O shortage, you could feel the pinch if you don't pump your own, but that's not the case right now


[02-Nov-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	i was just going down the whole self sufficient route


[02-Nov-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I've seen a few folks here make trips to Etherwind fairly regularly, which is super water-abundant. So you might be able to make some deals


[02-Nov-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yeah, I know the feeling. Many (most, even?) new players start out that way.


[02-Nov-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	in general it's best to have a specialized bases so that you can benefit the most from Experts and Adeveritsing Campaigns on each planet


[02-Nov-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	i've literally got 1 rig pumping into both my farms i've literally been playing a couple days


[02-Nov-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	for Prox it's farming, for Ether it's resource extraction, as an example


[02-Nov-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	when you start out you cannot avoid depending on the economy to supply yourself with base materials or consumables


[02-Nov-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	yeah farming was my main aim! i was just thinking the extra rig would help with water and drinking water but the sticking to buying water and building the profits make alot more sense


[02-Nov-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	esp if you're making drinking water, you'll find you need so many rigs to keep up with your needs that all your profits will just go into making rigs


[02-Nov-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	Its not the end of the world to build such a combo at the start when you are small, probably


[02-Nov-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	A number of new players I've helped felt more comfortable having a rig or two to supply a baseline level and then supplement by buying extra. It's not optimal, but you gotta also just enjoy yourself.


[02-Nov-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	And when the last H2O shortage hit (6 weeks ago?) the folks with a few RIGs maybe felt a little vindicated


[02-Nov-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	They can always tear the rig down eventually if they manage to find a reliable source of h2o


[02-Nov-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	the first rigs already there it can keep chugging away for me for now ha


[02-Nov-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	so its also not big of a loss in that sense, you get most materials back


[02-Nov-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	not optimal sure, comfy definitely


[02-Nov-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	yeah thats my current thought the little stream of h2o keeps me chugging along


[02-Nov-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	its my first go.. i'm gonna screw up, i'd rather just go out swinging than restarting every little blip, i feel like you learn more


[02-Nov-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	even if you screw up, or change your mind, you can always coliq and try again


[02-Nov-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	and treat this base as a test run to learn the game


[02-Nov-21 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	exactly


[02-Nov-21 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	well yea you learn quite alot in the first days


[02-Nov-21 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	apart from base building one thing that I had to learn the hard way is using your ships - try to fill up your cargo as much as you can, avoid flying empty - look/ask for shipping contracts - it will help you 'split the bill'


[02-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	also if need be i can revitalize some government support programs to help out newer proxion citizens :)


[02-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	also never increase the ftl slider for your flights and try to not burn too much sf to fly somewhere


[02-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	btw large Population Infrastructure build up just finished


[02-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	its a trap a lot of new players fall into where they increase their fuel usage way past the optimal range


[02-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	POPI UV-796b


[02-Nov-21 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	i figured out low and slow seems to be the way, and i've been doing little local market runs to make a bit of cash


[02-Nov-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	using your ships to run shipment ads is a good way to make extra money when you start out


[02-Nov-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	since at first you will rarely have need to fly 24/7


[02-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	that was my thought, they was just sitting there


[02-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	the early game is fairly slow, but to keep yourself entertained you could look into base planer spreadsheet and try to sorta learn the game through it too


[02-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	alongside with possibly planning/figuring out various different ideas for what you wanna do


[02-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	my original plan was get self sufficient with water and food on here sell excess until the next base is set up ( no idea what kind yet ) then go from there

**Carlosuss**:	oh right okay, makes sense


[07-Nov-21 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	in the link you can find math behind it, each consecutive expert from the same type takes more time to get


[07-Nov-21 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	ahh keep the production line running for 10 days then another 12


[07-Nov-21 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	yes


[07-Nov-21 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	thanks pal


[07-Nov-21 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	good thing is that each building of the same type makes it faster


[07-Nov-21 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carlosuss**:	Good to know


[07-Nov-21 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	so 4 farms will make the expert come 4 times faster


[07-Nov-21 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PalmTree**:	I might finally be able to grow my base, maybe add a PP2.   If I build a settler HB2 will I get settlers at my base?


[07-Nov-21 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	You'll get one Settler as a placeholder once the HB2 is constructed, but the rest won't show up until you actually build a structure that uses SET.


[07-Nov-21 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	And then you'll only get as many as the building needs to operate, up to the capacity of the Hab2 (100 SET).


[07-Nov-21 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PalmTree**:	Is there a limit to how many settlers Proxion can support?


[07-Nov-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	Yes; that information can be found in the Population Report on the Planet Info buffer.


[07-Nov-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	As of right now, Proxion has a SET population of 10,340, of which 67.6% are currently employed.


[07-Nov-21 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-21 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Dear Proxionites. I changed the taxes for Electronics from 15 to 50 per day. Also adjusted Ressource Extraction from 10 to 15. Minor changes, but these might accomodate for some of the upkeep costs we currently are facing. Lets see how the planet develops with all these new bases incoming.

**Zizzleswomp**:	presumably the people getting into electronics are more established players


[08-Nov-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	electronics are all high value products


[08-Nov-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	and although that's a jump percentage-wise, paying 50 CIS a day per electronics building is nothing


[08-Nov-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	and buildings cost in the range between 40k for the cheapest and up to 500k for the expensive ones


[08-Nov-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	i asked some electronics producers in the days before


[08-Nov-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-21 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	I was being facetious, I assumed it was something like that.  Also probably a majority of the high tier pop that cost so much.

**Corlis**:	Sorry for spamming the LM for a day. Crowd Funding for the University will begin in a sec, information about that will also come too


[09-Nov-21 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	Dear Citizen of Proxion,  our planet is currently the most developed planet of the universe in regards to Population Infrastructure. The goal of course is to reach Scientists. Current estimates put the birthday of the first scientist on the first of December. As this is a great feat already, as its the first Scientist to be born, he shall not be alone and therefore I propose we step up the Education.   Currently our max education, assuming we understand all POPI mechanics correctly, is 0.0045 x engineer population x scientist happiness. Assuming we reach 100 engineers soon, we therefore have a maximum education of 0.45 scientist per week. Not great, but still really good!


[09-Nov-21 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	If we were to add another University we would add another 0.002 to the education per week. Or in other terms 0.2 per week.  Of course the engineer population will also increase quickly and therefore at 200 engineers we would already reach over 1 scientist per week.  However to get new FTL capable ships the universe needs alot more scientists. Still we are progressing quickly and nicely.   Cost point of the University is 1500k. As usual i choose the path of crowd funding by cash, but of course contributions of A-fabs, DAs or LUs are very much welcomed.  In any case, grab your golden DW as before they are gone :P   Many thanks to Alcohlol, who is sponsoring the 2xBMF, 1x LOG and 300k to get this project rolling.  Also there was some over investment for the PAR which didn't get spent, many thanks again for ManoftheSea for bankrolling that.

[17-Nov-21 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MadPhoenix**:	doubt it =/ at least ive never seen any on the LM and very few on the Benten CX. Moria CX has very good supply thou, but you gotta calculate about 2k à MHL

**DocWatz**:	@kubelo - the 16 MHL for a single HYF takes about 12 days with a single WEL.  I may be able to work on some for delivery in 2+weeks, but can't guarantee a specific delivery/production time right now


[19-Nov-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I think Korbin (Katoa's governor) had made some, not sure if they are already used/sold though


[19-Nov-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Yes, I do MHL. Yes they take a really long time. Yes they cost 2.5k/u


[19-Nov-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I have 3 WEL, but currently working through 24 MHL, so be a while till I can take any extra orders.


[19-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KMF_Razgriz**:	No wonder I can't find the other half of the MHL that I need to for repairs.

If you find yourself in a similar situation feel free to join me out here and let us try to make a FP dedicated planet near Proxion and Etherwind (Apologies if you have seen this a lot I have put it in a few channels!)

[25-Nov-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	for those who ask what the impact of a LIB or UNI is. based on current figures, the LIB increases scientist growth by 0.12 per POPR, the UNI by 0.24. However its simply Engineer Count * 0.001 and 0.002 respectively. Which means in 2 weeks, when we are already at 200 engineers, this is 0.2 and 0.4 respectively. The engineer growth however is increased by roughly 3 for the LIB and 6 for the UNI under current Technician numbers

**Zizzleswomp**:	Suppose I decide I need cheap H in, like, a month from now. I probably won't remember those letter codes. Is there a good way to discover that planet again?

[07-Dec-21 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aldin**:	do we need to pitch in to popi? I don't really get why morale is dropping for eng/sci


[05-Jan-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Aldin - I don't think we do.  Since there is no incoming migration, I think the target for happiness is just to keep it >50% to prevent outgoing migration leading to ENG/SCI loss.


[05-Jan-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	pop growth is proportional to happiness


[05-Jan-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I'd have to dive deep again into the population mechanics- but I think growth from migration is, not sure if growth from education is


[05-Jan-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jan-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jan-22 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	hmm, I thought more univ would help but it looks like the art is just undersupplied, the UTS won't count for next cycle and last cycle we had only MHP and HOG for 4.5days worth


[11-Jan-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I guess each material is 25% and if out of 25% only one of 3 days cycle is filled then it's around 11% more so aprox where we are on culture

[02-Feb-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	By my reading, there's now 80 SCI jobs trying to share only 27 SCI workers


[02-Feb-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	indeed


[02-Feb-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	there's a bit more because every building that uses sci but has no sci habitation (ex SPF) will draw 1 scientist regardless because of rounding I guess


[02-Feb-22 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Aldin it does not appear so. There are 60 open jobs, but only accounting for the 20 SCI from last POPR. So next POPR open jobs will read 53


[02-Feb-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aldin**:	is there something in motion to supply the popi acordingly? our calculation showed we lack infrastructure a bit meaning that needs and morale will drastically drop if we do not 100% supply for the needs


[07-Feb-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	According to PiBoy's sheet, we're looking at: -1602 PIO, +366 SET, + 196 TECH, +86 ENG, +7 SCI next report.


[07-Feb-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Note that the sheet will be accurate for next report, but for no reports after that because of Thursdays changes


[07-Feb-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I think important is to keep happiness up for higher tiers or growing. Does the sheet say if we sufficiently supplied the needs to allow happiness to go up?


[07-Feb-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	by my calculation we will be short, even last report we were short safetly by quite lot, you can see it in report


[08-Feb-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Sorry, I didn't have time to read messaged here yesterday.


[08-Feb-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I stocked up all the POPI on Sunday before the last consumption. I've just been continuing to feed the same inputs that had been previously.


[08-Feb-22 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I won't pretend to understand the numbers behind POPI, so if folks have a clearer idea of what we need, other than what's already being provided, then please let me know (preferably on discord) and I will look to facilitate it.


[08-Feb-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	the coming patch is interesting one, it would likely render popi less effective so it would be nice if we could go for some scientist immigration campaign


[08-Feb-22 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	There's also educational programs by the looks of it, try to focus on "specking up" the workforce.


[08-Feb-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah but if we get let's say 30% sci growth out of our 7 that is marginal compared to a net amount, so before we reach a certain threshold of active population the bonus growth might not be that impactful compared with the immigration ones. Of course, depends on numbers


[08-Feb-22 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I heard it can reach to 25 sci/week, that's quite lot compared to what we can get from growth

[08-Feb-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's definitely the program to run @Dover if you want more SCI


[08-Feb-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And you can probably start shutting down POPI after next POPR. Education won't be needed


[08-Feb-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	sounds overpowered


[08-Feb-22 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I invested several millions in popi recently, I wouldn't call that growth "passive"


[08-Feb-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but the new immigration campaigns open the option to just build my own planet and stop hoping that people just don't fill up with labs when we're already at 30%


[08-Feb-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but I have some feeling it will have preconditions


[08-Feb-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I think the losers of this policy are the ones that went and built sci buildings where there are many more consumers, far easier after the patch to just crew a SL anywhere else rather than share it here with 5-6 ppl :)


[08-Feb-22 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep, for less than a million you can settle your own planet and have SCI within 2 weeks


[08-Feb-22 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It does not have preconditions on the test server and the devs responded that they're planning on going full steam ahead with the current version of the release


[08-Feb-22 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Thank you very much for your feedback! Rest assured we take it very seriously, especially since we know you as one of the POPI experts in our community!  Firstly, a late addition to the release notes: We ran some more simulations the last couple days with the new numbers and indeed noticed the decline of unhappy populations being too friendly (especially when they were really unhappy, i.e. 10% happiness or lower). This stems from a time when POPI was new and we didn’t want to punish players for not knowing how it worked yet. We are going to reduce this “stopgap” drastically, especially for higher workforce tiers. So it shouldn’t be possible to easily hold high numbers of scientists without POPI that fulfills their needs. If it is too easy, we will tweak the numbers on those programs (and/or population needs) of course.  Now I also want to explain where we’re coming from regarding the state of the universe (“what’s already been done”): You are of course right that planets had to invest


[08-Feb-22 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	-Counterpoint


[08-Feb-22 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Thanks for having a measured response to that, Pi. It is a rather abrupt wind change after all the hard work everyone has been putting in to eek out a few scientists here, but I guess that's part of being in early access. Everyone who worked so hard to accomplish what we've done here can be mighty proud, that's for sure!

[13-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	What price?


[13-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	offer a price


[13-Feb-22 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	36


[13-Feb-22 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	how about 50


[13-Feb-22 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	That's a fair price but I don't need RAT, just offering for the purpose of local liquidity. If you list at 50, someone will grab it eventually no doubt


[13-Feb-22 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	thats not a problem


[13-Feb-22 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zarik**:	@meatbeatmanifesto It looks like you are currently a trial account which means you wont be able to sell your RAT locally on Proxion. you will need to fly it to Benten (BEN) or Moria (MOR) to sell it on the CX. You can read more about Pro here: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/pro-license/

[14-Feb-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	You only need to pay for Pro one month in order to drop to Basic instead of Trial. This will allow you to accept LM ads but not post them which can definitely help with selling locally


[14-Feb-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	IM AWARE. RIGHT NOW NO POINT UPGRADING UNLESS POSSIBILITY OF SALE


[14-Feb-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	ignore caps


[14-Feb-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The possibility of a sale is nearly 100% lol


[14-Feb-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	Proxion is a pretty active planet. You are pretty likely to make a sale just by posting on the LM like Neke said provided its a reasonable price.


[14-Feb-22 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	cause im new i didnt like the thought of tieing up potential funds i guess


[14-Feb-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	i sent my RATs to benten station seeing no one looked interested


[14-Feb-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	You will likely get more for the RAT there (MOR might be better depending on the prices currently but a farther flight and then you have NCC instead)


[14-Feb-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	It seems most things are a bit cheaper on Prox LM, but then you dont have to ship it


[14-Feb-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MeatBeatManifesto**:	i wanted to buy some COF and PWO anyway


[14-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zarik**:	COF, the real drug of this universe


[14-Feb-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Work out the cost of fuel there and back and deduct it from your sales


[14-Feb-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Can usually get COF/PWO via the LM too, especially if it’s relatively small amounts


[15-Feb-22 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kubelo**:	since you've just begun you don't actually need 20 units of COF, 5 would be more than enough to get you by for a couple of days


[15-Feb-22 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	you can grab a couple from CX as you can't currently trade on local market


[15-Feb-22 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kubelo**:	take your time, explore the game for now and don't be afraid to restart your company, do so called 'COLIQ', when you have an idea how the game works and what is the best path for you to proceed

[16-Feb-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	what buildings did it have you make


[17-Feb-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spikeymud**:	I originally wanted to make fuel, but the demand for that was apparently low. So I just went for one of the higher demand ones (farming wasn't one)


[17-Feb-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spikeymud**:	2xHB1 BMP PP1


[17-Feb-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	so a PP1 is a constructor, BMP is manu - so you can go either way with that setup. Use the PP1 as a secondary to build your fabs to expand manu, or use manu to expand constructor


[17-Feb-22 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spikeymud**:	Im in the process of making the mats for a collector so I can get limestone to make MCG


[17-Feb-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Your PP1 only has 4 recipes to make stuff. Three of which require FE, which is stupid heavy to ship. So if you go that route, be prepared to either ship yourself, or go pro and buy the crap out of FE


[17-Feb-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If you go MANU, the PP1 can still make some BDE with the BMP outputs to lessen costs of expansion. FIO has BMP's on Prox, but all the PP1s are on planets like Gibson (FEO concentrations)


[17-Feb-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	happiness dropped for sci but I understand that keeping needs up is not really necessary anymore, saves funds for something else


[22-Feb-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Only 2 SCI open jobs are present, which looks really good

[23-Feb-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Well - for those of you that have $$ up the rear end. I'm sticking with traditional approach, so hopefully I won't have to keep paying "sunken costs" on the weekly initiatives.


[23-Feb-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Before the update, the POPI had to be really good to get the growth - now it can be much lower to just "sustain", or have very limited loss, as the programs can overcome that easily

[24-Feb-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dover**:	There seems to have become a gap in the RCO market. I was regularly picking off ads on the LM, but I haven't seen any for a while.


[08-Apr-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ramesses**:	I could start making it regularly, want me to pick some up from Benten for now? I'm already gonna be heading back from there today


[08-Apr-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Apr-22 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If anyone is selling BEA+GRN+NUT I've asked for 72 of each at 100/u on the LM. Prefer only fill the order if you can do all three for my RAT inputs :)

[21-Apr-22 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You can only have 6 per base, and 5 max per thpe


[21-Apr-22 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	type


[21-Apr-22 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	there are no more than 6 active experts in total


[21-Apr-22 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	they accrue over time, you don’t do anything particular to get them


[21-Apr-22 04:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Did anybody of you buy a third or even fourth FTL ship yet? And if yes, what did you pay for them?


[21-Apr-22 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	they’ve only just started being produced, they’re about 3.5-5m


[21-Apr-22 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	via public auction, or deep connections with an established corp


[21-Apr-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	STL ships, which are locked to one system, go for 450-600k


[21-Apr-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Yeah, I guess the first rolled out roughly a month ago. Or that was the talk about it.


[21-Apr-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Yeah nah, I am more interested in another FTL ship, depends a bit on how far and how much I want to expand.


[21-Apr-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	3.5-5mil! Is that what they've been going for?


[21-Apr-22 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Thanks for the answer tho^^


[21-Apr-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	in those auctions yeah


[21-Apr-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	We can do a lot cheaper, but there's a long queue


[21-Apr-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	im paying less for mine


[21-Apr-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	which is where the connections come in :)


[21-Apr-22 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	How's that Dover?


[21-Apr-22 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Well we're producing them in corp, so keeping the costs low for each other.


[21-Apr-22 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	I understand. Maybe it's time to tighten my community acitivity here. AFter all I am around for almost 100 days.


[21-Apr-22 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You won’t get an FTL ship on your own with no contacts except via the rare public auction


[21-Apr-22 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I think that’s a fair statement


[21-Apr-22 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Who is making ships in corp Dover? FOWL, KAWA


[21-Apr-22 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Also a Pro account would help, otherwise you're at the mercy of the CX


[21-Apr-22 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	They are I believe. We are in MKM also.


[21-Apr-22 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	I was hesistating with pro, mainly because I just wanted to see how far I can get without one.


[21-Apr-22 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	MKM was?


[21-Apr-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I did that in the first universe Johnny, I'm a great fan of grinding rather than paying :D


[21-Apr-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	But the possibility alone to fill the ship with LM contracts when I fly anyways is a very convincing argument.


[21-Apr-22 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But it was really a massive change when I did start using Pro. But if you are still at one base it may not be overly fruitful yet.


[21-Apr-22 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Good to hear^^ How did that turn out for you? I am at 6 rigs now, and I am planning on getting 3 more in advance of the further expansion of my base. ANd it feels like being not on par sometimes.


[21-Apr-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Would be much easier to just chuck in an infinite qeue of H2O.


[21-Apr-22 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Honestly, it would be more beneficial for you to source H2O elsewhere and ship it here.


[21-Apr-22 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Proxion is not a great water source.


[21-Apr-22 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Ok, good to know. May I ask which region you would reccomend for that?


[21-Apr-22 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	It's not my specialty for sure, but Etherwind is a reasonable source. If you want to go a bit more adventurous then you go search for an ice planet.


[21-Apr-22 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Alright^^, I am not sure if I can back this financially yet. Thanks for your tips folks.


[21-Apr-22 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Etherwind would be a good first spot. PLI KW-688c gives you 42 H2O concentration. Proxion is only 8.4


[21-Apr-22 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch?Resources=H2O&Rocky=true&LowTemp=true


[21-Apr-22 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Etherwind isn't that far too.


[21-Apr-22 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	thanks for checking up.


[21-Apr-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you have PRO you can post buys for water right here on the LM


[21-Apr-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	dopes like me do silly things like fly water around for sale :)


[21-Apr-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Or when you make occasional trips to the CX I try and ensure (with a small bunch of other players) that water is always available in the 16-22/u range :)


[21-Apr-22 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Damn, that's next level water juggling ^^


[21-Apr-22 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	Mhh, not sure if I want to buy the water if I can bring it in myself.


[21-Apr-22 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	But another base means having to provide basic needs there too.


[21-Apr-22 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I actually have 200 H2O en route here right now.


[21-Apr-22 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	can't buy from LM tho.


[21-Apr-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	incidentally im out of water hjere on prox


[21-Apr-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	how embarrassing


[21-Apr-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	I am at 4 rn, I would consider that out too. ^^


[21-Apr-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	yeah you're also out haha


[21-Apr-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	neke, I have no need for this H2O so feel free to post a buy


[21-Apr-22 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	It arrives in 23h


[21-Apr-22 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	posted


[21-Apr-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Many thanks


[21-Apr-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Do you ever bring CLI/AUO this way?


[21-Apr-22 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I wish I had the shipping capacity.


[21-Apr-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But it's always available for pickup from QJ-650c


[21-Apr-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	is that within 24h?


[21-Apr-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	If you bring some spare fuel.


[21-Apr-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	It's 2 hops from ANT


[21-Apr-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	oof


[21-Apr-22 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	mhh, what was the pioneer consumption per 100? 0.8 DW and RAT right?


[21-Apr-22 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	adn 0.2 per100?


[21-Apr-22 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	nah, 8 RAT and DW /100 dudes.


[21-Apr-22 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johnny_Awesome**:	per day


[21-Apr-22 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	isn't it 4/100 ?


[21-Apr-22 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	4 RAT, 4 DW, 0.5 OVE, 0.5 COF, 0.2 PWO


[21-Apr-22 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	unrelated: 2,500 H2O incoming


[21-Apr-22 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-22 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ETA 9 hours

[24-May-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**UberGrunk**:	Later in the game that extra 1k is not such a big deal when your often very limited transport capacity is reserved for much more valuable cargo or moving supplies between your bases

**Sarantia**:	Huh, so is this all for corp ships.  No ship parts seem to make it to the CX.  I’ve spent the past few weeks converting money to AIC so I can buy it at ANT.


[02-Jun-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	Just put up a bunch of buys on the Proxion LM to help fill the CoGC, if anyone has what's required and prefers a higher price, we can negotiate, feel free to DM me (this first pass of ads is for in-corp prices and I can adjust them)


[06-Jun-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	Hello everyone. I have 16 MHL.CI1 coming available in 17 hours on Katoa and I'm selling them by silent auction. If you are interested, please direct message me your bid via COM or Discord. The winner is the person who offers the highest bid, but the final price will be the second highest bid received (So if you bid 1,000 but the next highest was 800, you win and pay 800). Bids are open for 36 hours from now.


[07-Jun-22 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Delivery to Proxion is free, but may take a little longer.

**neke86**:	Yeah


[07-Jun-22 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I can take them to CX and get 3.5+ but

[07-Jun-22 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm not exactly high volume either


[07-Jun-22 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	A far better solution would have been large corporations supplying COF


[07-Jun-22 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Instead, now, dozens of small-medium players off trying to source their own

[07-Jun-22 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

If anyone has any questions about POPI, Tax, COGC then first take a look at the Governorship accounting sheet, and then let me know if you have further questions. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eu4BWu9erSmiBsPjYLCqRo2RqdScLXkvUG6wZDyIrq0/edit?usp=sharing

[09-Jun-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Because things can get complicated due to shitty contact mechanics on 1-day contracts, people kind of have to put them at 2-3


[09-Jun-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YoyoStelar**:	ye

[09-Jun-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Re: the election, so long as the CoGC stays off strike then there's little reason for me to run quite honestly; my concern is the the CoGC should never be striking in the first place. It should be high priority and ideally it should be filled earlier in the cycle, rather than waiting for donations to the CoGC before filling it (since tax revenue is meant to go towards paying it in the first place, people should not need to donate).


[09-Jun-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Missing the CoGC deadline multiple times when there is technically a 10 day grace period is in my opinion not satisfactory


[09-Jun-22 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Boooo! _heckles_


[09-Jun-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**alxnns**:	I like your style


[09-Jun-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Honestly if people prefer Dover as gov't I'd be fine with it, but I'll probably start to help manage the CoGC on the side and ask for reimbursement from Dover if that happens


[09-Jun-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Being the governor isn't necessary for me to help ensure the CoGC gets filled, it just reduces the need for hopping through an extra hoop to ask Dover for reimbursement


[09-Jun-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	He usually pays anyway but I agree, better to do it up front


[09-Jun-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah he always has done a good job of bookkeeping and reimbursing, it's just that we shouldn't be missing cycles in the first place lol


[09-Jun-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm not the governor so it's technically not my responsibility


[09-Jun-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I suggest everyone who is sitting on the fence recognise that we aren't disparaging Dover, their ethics or their commitment to the game and Proxion, just pointing out that it seems like NorseFTX has more time to dedicate to the governorship and this is the most efficient way we can guarantee that the CoGC will stop going on strike


[09-Jun-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I’ve my vote to Norse. FOWL/KAWA have been excellent patrons and have an established track record elsewhere that I would be happy to see replicated here.

[10-Jun-22 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EyangKodok**:	thats all?


[10-Jun-22 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**YoyoStelar**:	Last time i went from benten around the galaxy with around 10 contracts i think


[10-Jun-22 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EyangKodok**:	is that common?? boy oh boy


[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Don;t take it personally, but the game offers us very little control over contracts and shipping


[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YoyoStelar**:	i mean if you put in 3 days then it will take somewhere within those 3 days


[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YoyoStelar**:	yeah i know


[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dover**:	On the topic of the election: I thank NorseFTX in standing against me, too long have I run in power unchallenged. I also thank them for their efforts in maintaining the COGC while I was off on holiday. The COGC is a Chamber of GLOBAL Commerce, and by such isn't the responsibility of oneYet. Yet, it has always been part of the bookkeeping. But it is a very small part, accounting for less than 10% of the plantery expenses!   POPI is the far more pressing matter. Since taking the reins over from FOWL governance, we have been able to grow the high level populations (after managing a major spike that caused huge unemployment). Yet also dropped the taxes that everyone is/was paying.   I'm not making any new campaign pledges. But for the newcomers to Proxion, everything is done in a transparent manner. The state of play can always be found in the Proxion Governorship Accounting document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eu4BWu9erSmiBsPjYLCqRo2RqdScLXkvUG6wZDyIrq0/edit?usp=sharing

**NorseFTX**:	\o/


[10-Jun-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Just to play devil's advocate--doesn't it still make more sense for governmental taxes cover the CoGC, at least in the sense of fairness?


[10-Jun-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Even if it is titled the "Chamber of Global Commerce" (implying "Global" - being all players' responsibility), all players are already technically contributing to the CoGC through production fee revenue. Relying on direct donations would inherently place a disproportionally greater load on the players that decide to donate (players who do not donate will benefit more greatly), whereas using tax revenue to purchase the goods for the CoGC would more evenly distribute the load across all players with bases on Proxion (who pay production fees).


[10-Jun-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Wealthy players donate more, in my experience, but yea it means the burden falls on fewer rather than more


[10-Jun-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think there's nothing wrong with donation if people wish to do so, but I do think it makes more sense for the CoGC to also be the responsibility of the government to oversee rather than individual players; all players entrust the government with a portion of their revenue via taxes to help cover these types of things (among others).


[10-Jun-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's also mentioned that CoGC expenses are only a minority of the expenses so it shouldn't be too much of a burden to cover its upkeep via tax revenue.


[10-Jun-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	The expense is always covered.


[10-Jun-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	As you rightly know with the golden DW ad you placed for those items donated in the last period.


[10-Jun-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**karr1981**:	50 BDE available, just dm me to arrange deal


[10-Jun-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	I also think the problem is not the way the CoGC is payed but the lack of materials the planet needs for POPI. Dover repeatedly asked for materials for the POPI and wasn't able to source them. it is the job of the governor to organize it and pay with it with taxes but the governing entity can't just magically make mats appear. It is in need of help of the planets inhabitants to fulfill the material needs. I think Dover has done all that and therefore my vote goes to him.


[10-Jun-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think Dover has actually done a great job with POPI, I just also think if the CoGC is relatively minor in comparison cost wise, it shouldn't be going on strike.


[10-Jun-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	As a member of FOWL, many of our players have governor positions on other planets and we have access and the ability to source the most cost-effective POPI upkeep materials, so filling upkeep for POPI and encouraging higher tier workforce growth should not be an issue if I were governor either.


[10-Jun-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Even if I don't end up being elected, I've been scaling up production for POPI-related materials myself and will provide them as required.


[10-Jun-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If Dover is able to solicit enough materials to cover POPI upkeep, then there is no reason he should be missing CoGC upkeep when it is arguably less burdensome to do so.


[10-Jun-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The only reason it may be happening is due to being too busy to properly cover the upkeep.


[10-Jun-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(Or it was overlooked, worst case was intentionally not filled, but I don't think that's the case)


[10-Jun-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The issue is his availability and capacity to consistently fulfill duties as governor, not his competence.


[10-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think he is more than competent for the position, but may not have the time to do so as evidenced by missing (repeatedly) deadlines for upkeep.


[10-Jun-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Either way on the last day before the CoGC upkeep cycle ends moving forward, I'll personally make an effort to get it filled regardless of what happens for this election :V

**karr1981**:	Hi Norse, are your prefab buy orders prearranged contracts or you looking to buy open market?

**karr1981**:	ok


[10-Jun-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although if others wish to fill them at that price they can do so, but it might be tough for that to be profitable at current MM consumables prices so I wouldn't suggest it unless you have a built network for consumables already

**Rwinner16**:	I'm cool with either party, but I'll say this. Dover took over because FOWL had these COGC issues.. But back then there wasn't a game supply issue. Fowl also is a group of people, yet it still went on strike for failure to fill.. Dover is one person.. Dover has repeatedly asked in discord for suppliers for COGC and POPI materials. He can't produce everything as one person. If people won't donate or sell to him, he's kinda stuck.. He also went on a real world vacation. NGL, I'd be afk as well. I don't get vacations often.

**Rwinner16**:	Proxion has done well under both parties historically, so we'll be good with either outcome. I just don't like the attacks. Some planets do the governorship cover the COGC, some wait until the last couple of days or so to let any willing volunteers offer services. Personally, I try to do it myself on EW, but there have been a few times that I've had to ask for coverage help.

**Dover**:	Thanks Rwinner. You are exactly right on those points.


[11-Jun-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I've now this week founded an Etherwind base in an attempt to secure a DW supply, as that is the main source of issue for COGC upkeep, given the scarcity of DW here. Not to mention the demands of DW also from the SST and PAR. COF has also been lacking for the UNI (and well, everywhere!) so my EW base is hopefully going to provide for that too.


[11-Jun-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I was not around during the prior FOWL governorship on Proxion so I can't say anything about our past history about CoGC going on strike


[11-Jun-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	But I can say that I will make efforts to fill the CoGC moving forward regardless of whether or not I am elected, quite honestly.


[11-Jun-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's important to have vacation, although it would be helpful to let the rest of the people on Proxion know that they''ll need to cover the CoGC while they're away (or give us some other form of warning)


[11-Jun-22 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I may have come off too strong, and don't mean what I say as an attack. I was just stating how I saw things.


[11-Jun-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm new and was completely unaware of the past issues this corp has had; although I'm not sure what happened in the past, I hope that I can help work to recover the reputation for this corporation.

[11-Jun-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Fundamentally if NorseFTX supports Dover then the CoGC will get filled and there will be no platform and it would be logistically simpler for NorseFTX to do that themselves as governor


[11-Jun-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	It's just my opinion as I don't speak for NorseFTX but it makes sense that NorseFTX would be want that position if it's not being filled


[11-Jun-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don’t think he needs to support him really, and anyone can hit the slide bar - I supported Katoa for an entire term when the Governor quit (twice actually). I just want to see if it’s flowery rhetoric

**neke86**:	Lets not pretend that there have been extended crippling COGC strikes or shortages


[11-Jun-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jun-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	That's fair, I wasn't around for any of it


[11-Jun-22 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	"Why not withdraw, spend one term supporting Dover with his new base" - Actually this was what I was initially going to do, but I had support from people who encouraged me to apply for a governmental position so I decided to do so. With the current vote spread, it seems I do have a notable amount of support, and I want to honor the votes of those people, so I'll be staying in the race for now.


[11-Jun-22 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	My platform and promises are pretty straight forward: Timely, consistent POPI and CoGC upkeep for each cycle, with continued tracking of governmental revenue activity in the existing Proxion Governorship Accounting spreadsheet. I do hope to improve some aspects of the spreadsheet to make it more useful to people who wish to help contribute resources to POPI/CoGC. If foresee being unable to carry out these duties (due to real life engagements), I will give at least 3 weeks' notice beforehand.

**Dover**:	So I've been scrutinizing over the reports after @ManjiTec_Ka pointed something out in the planet chat the other day. It does actually appear that the Government finances are in debt to the tune of about 500k. Now it's not all gloom and doom, as the government also holds over 400k in inventory value, so the deficit is really only around the 100k mark at the start of this week.   I would like to ask @NorseFTX - should they become governor, how do they intend to wipe off this debt, and how will they look to keep Proxion accounts in the black?

[13-Jun-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I've mentioned on discord. I would claw it back over time, perhaps with a small raise in taxes. Preferably with reduced spending.

**Rwinner16**:	Vote for Rwinner!

**neke86**:	Oh man who let @Rwinner16 in here


[13-Jun-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Hey now! I slipped in the open window..


[13-Jun-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh I remember back when we were losing scientists a little over a month ago, that you also had applied as governor like two elections back @Rwinner16 lol


[13-Jun-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I actually considered voting for you because we were losing scientists at the time and I was a bit worried about whether Dover would be able to cover everything, although you ended up withdrawing pretty quickly and Dover was able to cover POPI well enough working with the players


[13-Jun-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	One of my hopes as governor is also to reduce taxes as well, although only after taking care of what's needed for the Proxion POPI / etc.


[13-Jun-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	That loss of POP was on purpose. There was no point trying to offset happiness with unemployment.


[13-Jun-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think the time we were worried was when it was still dropping even when the unemployment was already 0%


[13-Jun-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Initially we were fine with the drop and nobody complained since there was still the unemployment buffer yeah


[13-Jun-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also for those curious I did address Dover's question about eliminating debt in the UFO (Unified Faction Operations) discord in the Proxion channel, was a long set of analysis, but long story short: 1) The debt was mostly generated by purchasing and stockpiling the POPI in the recent 10 days; 2) We can work towards reducing debt long term by upgrading existing POPI structure (which we should've done a while ago due to the influx of new players from Steam) which saves money longterm by reducing the requirement for running Governmental programs.


[13-Jun-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And by "debt was mostly generated", I mean ALL the debt was generated within the past 10 days from POPI stockpile purchases

[13-Jun-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Although I don't think (?) this is a malicious action, since stockpiling POPI materials helps make filling POPI in the future easier, although maybe might be a bit excessive to stockpile this much as well lol


[13-Jun-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But given that a few weeks ago the balance was around 800k, then this shows we need to take action either way.

[13-Jun-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And I mentioned one way in which we can address it (reduce governmental program spending requirements by upgrading existing infrastructure)


[13-Jun-22 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Increasing the SST isn't going to help with Scientist happiness though, and that's the one that's in the major balance.


[13-Jun-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It still does, although marginally


[13-Jun-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Filling the POPI for the University does more towards contributing to Scientist happiness


[13-Jun-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	From what I've calculated, we don't need to build more Universities at the moment


[13-Jun-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	We just would need to be more consistent with filling the upkeep for it


[13-Jun-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Which is exactly the reason I'm producing HD 24/7 and just founded a EW COF base.


[13-Jun-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah HD is extremely cost effective


[13-Jun-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think COF isn't as much though


[13-Jun-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	COF is still better than nothing


[13-Jun-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	When it comes to CIS per Educational Need Fulfillment, the most efficient ones are:


[13-Jun-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	University - HD > University - TUB > Library - DIS > Planetary Broadcasting Hub - OFF > Library - MHP, and it goes down from there


[13-Jun-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Remember this is going to depend entirely on what values you are using for inputs


[13-Jun-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm going off KAWA prices :V


[13-Jun-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Exactly


[13-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(since I'm in a corp that is able to provide those items at KAWA prices)


[13-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	So I plan to fill based on those prices


[13-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I mean at this point isn't everyone able to buy goods at KAWA prices?


[13-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I provide much of them to you at that price when I can get a hold of them


[13-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	If you plan to use KAWA prices, you'll be putting taxes up by the end of the week.


[13-Jun-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	:V That reminds me, I do still have to run the numbers on the production fee spread


[13-Jun-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Actually something that always confused me was the current Agriculture tax spread (PIO/SET/TEC/ENG/SCI = 15/15/20/20/25)


[13-Jun-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	are there even any SCI agriculture buildings lol


[13-Jun-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	This isn't something that's a big deal, it just looked funny to me


[13-Jun-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I do kind of agree that the SCI (or higher tier) workforce output being taxed by slightly more makes sense, although in general it doesn't seem to be equally applied to all industries


[13-Jun-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I kind of wish the game would give you the precise breakdown of how much tax revenue comes from each of the industries


[13-Jun-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	never been gov't before so I'm not sure if you do get anything like that, but I assumed you don't


[13-Jun-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	*from each industry and work force tier

**neke86**:	You don’t

[13-Jun-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	No, and there's the whole you have to be in a solo corp to even see WHERE the taxes would come from.


[13-Jun-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I see you've done that anyway.


[13-Jun-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nicster**:	There is EDC production happening here already ;)


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh based on my calculations, EDC is one of the lower-priority population upkeep materials since it's less cost effective


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Filling EDC for a round will improve happiness on the order of 0.5-3% across all the populations


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Honestly with those numbers I think it's a lot more cost effective to straight up sell the EDC to the market maker


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and then use that money to fund other POPI (for that matter, 4 EDC already funds half of the Planetary Festivities III program too, which is +20% across all populations)


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which is much better than the return you'd get from putting the 4 EDC in PBH instead


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You'd have to be willing to sell the EDH for under market maker prices to make it worthwhile for POPI and I don't think that's efficient for anyone currently, at least til inflation gets there x:


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(and the price of all other goods inflates to the point that the market maker price of EDC is actually worthwhile)


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	TL;DR @neke86 I think you can feel safe selling the EDC to the Market Maker, I think everyone benefits more from that since it's more efficient to sell to MM than to put EDC into POPI.


[15-Jun-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Tbh I probably should put up an SE myself (or can negotiate with someone who does have one); one SE making EDC full time basically pays for a Planetary Festivities III program every week if it's needed, and it's basically guaranteed since it's paid for by the market maker lol

**neke86**:	As you prefer!


[15-Jun-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah, to make it somewhat comparatively cost effective vs the other PBH upkeep materials, I'd have to buy at 6300 cis per unit of EDC, and you can sell EDC at a guaranteed price of 16,000 to the market maker so it's probably better just to sell it to the market maker


[15-Jun-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If you really want to sell it below MM price, it's still straight up better to sell to the MM, keep 6300 cis, and give the rest to the government so it can be put towards other more cost effective materials (LOL), and I don't think that's worth the hassle


[15-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	if you sold it to me below MM it's still better for me to just take it to the MM anyway and use the money for more efficient options :B

**NorseFTX**:	Yeah POW I think is just slightly more revenue efficient if converted into RAD


[16-Jun-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The margin on POW's MM vs Kawa price isn't as big as EDC's though (2700 vs MM 4200), yeah EDC is definitely the bigger opportunity loss if not sold to the MM (6300 vs 16000)


[16-Jun-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Using POW for POPI is slightly more okay


[16-Jun-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Using EDC on popi in the past isn't 100% wasted either v: it's just inefficient compared to alternatives but still does the job (just at a higher price)


[16-Jun-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	On a side note - you may look at the recurring costs of POPI vs the one time cost of upgrading the POPI. It's one of the reasons that EW's SST is higher level than Proxions.


[16-Jun-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	Yeah you definitely want to upgrade SSTs (or other infrastructure if it's not sufficient to hit desired happiness metrics), it is absolutely more revenue-efficient to upgrade POPI infrastructure (particularly SST and INF being the most efficient ones) as opposed to running Governmental programs to boost happiness


[16-Jun-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	For higher tier POPI structures, it depends a great deal on how much growth for higher tier workforce is desired


[16-Jun-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	There's a lot to consider since for higher tier workforce, since you still need a certain amount of lower tier work force to support the production of consumables for higher tier workers


[16-Jun-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	ignoring the programs - I'm talking about how a level 3 of a POPI building with 1 recurring input provides the same total overall output towards POP %'s as a level 1 with all 3 inputs fed.


[16-Jun-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	So does increasing your higher tier POPI programs under the same premise, provide a cheaper better resolution to continue upgrading, or spending on recurring?


[16-Jun-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh, yeah mathematically supplying 1 upkeep material can end up more efficient if you can afford the upgrades AND you have enough suppliers for that single item (such as OFF)


[16-Jun-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	sometimes it ends up being more feasible to have two or three inputs just because there isn't a high enough capacity for production of a single input so it's easier to spread the upkeep across different industries


[16-Jun-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	like the SDP. Is it worth keeping it 50% fed with upkeeps, or worth upgrading it to a level where only 1 upkeep needed?


[16-Jun-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Or if youre at the point where you start needing 3 upkeeps - is it worth to upgrade 1 level to keep it at 2 upkeeps necessary


[16-Jun-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I'm honestly surprised that Proxion is feeding the Drone Post instead of finshing off the SST


[16-Jun-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yes, I agree x:


[16-Jun-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	From the math I've done we should have 11 SSTs instead of 7


[16-Jun-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	we never added more since the Steam influx of new players


[16-Jun-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which definitely would explain the increase to gov't debt over time


[16-Jun-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	That's all I'm saying. I ran those #'s with EW back when I was pushing for higher POP #'s. The level 10 SST won out hands down.


[16-Jun-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yup


[16-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think one of the things moving forward is to balance maintaining current population while investing as much as possible into building up the necessary POPI buildings that we're missing


[16-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But, I am intentionally keeping EW's #'s much higher than they honestly need to be. One, eventually people will figure out it's not a bad place to be. Two - it takes time to adjust for any unepecteds (up to 5 POP cycles to correct a messup).


[16-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	unexpecteds*


[16-Jun-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think it's good to give yourself leeway for growth rather than to be behind the curve honestly =P


[16-Jun-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so having a few more extra POPI buildings doesn't hurt imo


[16-Jun-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jun-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	We could actually benefit from losing safety, and trimming the fat off the Pio and Set population.


[16-Jun-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	50% unemployment of Settlers.


[16-Jun-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Under my governance we have 0 open jobs, so all this talk about upgrading POPI seems for naught.


[16-Jun-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh I think upgrading the existing SST will actually reduce the cost of maintaining the current population, which was why I wanted to do it


[16-Jun-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I wouldn't upgrade it past 11 though, that would be excessive


[16-Jun-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	at least not for now, unless there were an additional substantial wave of new players


[16-Jun-22 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yeah our settler unemployment is quite high, although it's kind of an unavoidable evil since "Education In" values for each worker tier depends on the size of the prior workforce tier, so to get scientists you still need to inflate the population of settlers to get more TEC in (which means more ENG > more SCI in) even if fewer players are actively using Settlers


[16-Jun-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I was thinking of aiming for a goal / desired target unemployment percentage of maybe ~5-10%? for scientists so that a small number are available, and maintaining that as players fill it in


[16-Jun-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	So that players who desire scientist buildings can feel more comfortable about whether there will be enough workforce available to build SCI buildings


[16-Jun-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	but there's no need to grow SCI past the target unemployment rate, at least until players start employing them


[16-Jun-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I think POPI level 10 is max?


[16-Jun-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Basically keeping a buffer for available workforce for players


[16-Jun-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh okay, 10 it is


[16-Jun-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	if 10 is the max then there is actually an upper limit to how much population a given planet can comfortably support, that's good to know


[16-Jun-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yep, and prior to the programmes being implemented, I don't think a planet that exceeded the plot limit could maintain happy


[16-Jun-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	PiBoy would be the go-to for anything POPI related tho tbh.

[16-Jun-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Pull up Promitor and look at their last POPR


[16-Jun-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	They've got the SST maxed, and fully funded, and are only keeping a 57% overall.


[16-Jun-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Thats how lopsided it's getting for them due to the overpopulation


[16-Jun-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I would love to see their tax revenue though. They look to be making bank!


[16-Jun-22 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	yeah at that point if you want growth you'll need to end up using programs and the rest of the POPI buildings that have diminishing returns


[16-Jun-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh dang is Promitor trying to fill scientists without any education need fulfillment and with only one UNI lol


[16-Jun-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

I'd like to thank all those who voted for and supported me during this brief but exciting period.

[17-Jun-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Hopefully the votes gave enough indication that there is a sizable population of people on this planet that wish to have the CoGC filled in a timely manner, and are dissatisfied with the multiple strikes that have occurred before this election began.


[17-Jun-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Moving forward, I'll be keeping an eye on the CoGC. @Dover, if unable to fill the CoGC in time or going on extended leave, ideally it would be best to let us know ahead of time so we can prepare accordingly.


[17-Jun-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Since I am not governor, it is not my responsibility to fill the CoGC. However, moving forward, if it does go on strike, I'll fill it as soon as possible.

**NorseFTX**:	In the event that the CoGC goes on strike again and I have to take action (without advance notice), I will run once more for governor. Otherwise, as long as governmental duties are being fulfilled, I have no plans to run. With the high number of eyes on this election, I hope that moving forward, Proxion upkeep will be more consistently maintained. Thank you again to all who supported me during this run!

[18-Jun-22 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	@karr1981 I don't think the next level of the WAR would give extra player slots.


[18-Jun-22 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	At least this happened about 1.5? Months ago back when we were losing scientists


[22-Jun-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	A week before the unemployment became positive, people were already not having enough for employment


[22-Jun-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Idk if the display is like a week behind or something


[22-Jun-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jun-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	we can't just run naked with only a UNI due to how need fulfillment gets capped by previous need tiers (so Education can only be as high as the minimum of Comfort or Culture)


[22-Jun-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And because of that although we do need UNI fulfillment, it does not need 100% uptime


[22-Jun-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	since 100% uptime would be past the cap of Comfort / Culture


[22-Jun-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	we should be building more infrastructure for Comfort / Culture since otherwise it'll be very easy to leak SCI


[22-Jun-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	we have enough infrastructure that satisfies Edu need but not enough for the needs below it (Com/Cul)


[22-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Tbh if we're able to source the RFabs, an Art Cafe is probably the best choice


[22-Jun-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	otherwise all the workers on the planet have to settle with the 2 Art Galleries on the planet to satisfy all their cultural needs lol

[22-Jun-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**silentium_noxe**:	and second question - health is just one of variables which define a buf for production?


[24-Jun-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	so the "Need Fulfillment" that youre talking about? Those factors determine the population immigration to the planet, as well as the ability of the population to convert up a tier from PIO to SET, etc.


[24-Jun-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It is almost always better to max level the cheaper building that provides a buff to the Need Fullfillment you want to target. In this Case max out the SST before building Hospitals.


[24-Jun-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Mainly because - cheaper acquisition costs of both the construction matierals, and the weekly recurring input costs to keep it operational.

[24-Jun-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	yes, but all tiers are needed for the higher population.


[24-Jun-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The Culture/Comfort/Education %'s are capped by the lower of the Safety/Health %.


[24-Jun-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	So if safety is at 60%, Comfort can't get over 60%, etc.

[04-Jul-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	The hardest part about retaining the higher tiers of POP is keeping the lower POP tiers overall #'s as low as possible, but still keeping some unemployment. 22.5% doesn't seem high, until you see that its 22.5% of 155,000.


[11-Jul-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yes, you've got to have the POPI to support SCI's, but its dramatically harder with such high #'s of low tiers. Thats why a lot of people want empty/low pop planets for high tech bases. Easier to grow into the need than try to fix planets like this.

**NorseFTX**:	I think with a proper supply chain we actually should be able to maintain the SCI population on proxion though, at least based on what I saw of the tax revenue


[11-Jul-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	At least, it should be, probably shouldn't have spent about 393k on 1191 REA when it's one of the least efficient popi upkeep materials, and at a pretty poor pricing (looking at the accounting sheet) which was a large part of what put us in debt


[11-Jul-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Since there's presumably going to be a Planetary Festivities program run next week we might be a little bit more okay, although the POPI upkeep isn't quite sufficient atm if we were to keep going at this rate


[11-Jul-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dover**:	I've made a slight adjustment to taxes. To cover expenses for keeping SCI POPI filled, I've increased the taxes of the SCI levels. I also bumped slightly the AGR taxes as they get the bonus from the COGC.


[17-Jul-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I noticed only the Agriculture values got changed, why not increase taxes for SCI/ENG in the other industries? There aren't any Agriculture buildings that require ENG or SCI so those won't really have much effect (?)


[17-Jul-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Not sure if there was a second set of changes but there are higher levels for TEC>SCI and Electronics


[17-Jul-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I still think it would be possible to maintain scientists without needing to raise the taxes but with this it should be easier


[17-Jul-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Agriculture is low margin, I'd not target that industry like I do Manufacturing - but TEC/ENG, they can pay bigly


[17-Jul-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm just assuming most people would generally react negatively to the taxes, I personally am okay with it since I currently donate sometimes anyway, and would be willing to give a little more cash


[17-Jul-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I thought that too but in the end, they didn't


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	They won't notice


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I would think if you want to encourage agriculture on a planet you indirectly subsidize it by lowering the taxes


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although maybe people won't really notice


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	As I said, agriculture is lower margin, I probably wouldn't target that so much as I have manufacturing


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	but any TEC+ can _easily_ afford significantly more taxes


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I agree about that


[17-Jul-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ENG=500 goes largely unnoticed


[17-Jul-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think increasing TEC/ENG/SCI taxes makes more sense than PIO


[17-Jul-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	On an SE harvesting the EDC MM, it's a road bump


[17-Jul-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	since oftentimes people who are on the PIO level aren't really benefitting as much from POPI and all the expense of the higher tier workforce


[17-Jul-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	On an ASM being spread across 18-27 AST, it's nominal


[17-Jul-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	same for AMLs


[17-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	yeah due to the high prices given by the MMs for Eng/Sci stuff it's probably fine to have the higher taxes on that side


[17-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	rather than punishing newer / smaller PIO-only players


[17-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

People have been asking me to once again, so I think I may plan on applying for government this upcoming round.

**Tibster**:	The logical tax system is one where unemployment is untaxed and open jobs are. Since the goal of POPI is to increase workers where it's needed, PIO don't need any more of it and would end up subsidizing higher tier workers. CoGC isn't that big of an expense per base. I get about 400 per base and it's every 10 days? so 40 per base per day. +5 for agriculture PIO seems fair to me.

[18-Jul-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	There’s no way base taxation covers COGC and POPI


[18-Jul-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Based on the calculations I have you can maintain sci with 24869 cis/day


[18-Jul-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Which would be 174k per week (and the weekly revenue currently was around 300k per week, before tax raises)


[18-Jul-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	That's for POPI, for CoGC the total per 10 days fluctuates between 60-90k per 10 days

[18-Jul-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jul-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which I think is fine because I still make a slim margin


[18-Jul-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Imo making a profit wouldn't really be my motive for governing, it's the development of the planet (and the system) and enabling players to grow more quickly


[18-Jul-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so slightly lower taxes and a narrower margin imo aren't huge demerits to me


[18-Jul-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	the same as every governor in station i think


[18-Jul-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	ye


[18-Jul-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I


[18-Jul-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And if it can be done more efficiently or with lower cost then imo that's beneficial to everyone


[18-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	it’s absurdly cheap


[18-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I mean, I'm still making a narrow profit lol, which can be invested in development


[18-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	let’s not continue making something out of nothing, it’s going on the nose


[18-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	just run again next time


[18-Jul-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Well people have complained to me personally about it so that's why I'm bringing it up lol


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	thanks, can they bring it up here?


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I do think the taxes in practice are relatively minor, but even something minor that's unnecessary is still unnecessary


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	So Dover can answer them


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I mean, FOWL rates is what I use for everything I can get from FOWL.


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But I can't get everything from FOWL/KAWA because they don't have everything.


[18-Jul-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Some things I get cheaper from MKM


[18-Jul-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Others I have to reach out to the depths of Moria for!


[18-Jul-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think we don't necessarily have to make everything


[18-Jul-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	FYI @Dover not sure if you saw the message in the fowl discord, but wanted to make sure you knew not to fill more than 1 UNI upkeep item at any given time


[18-Jul-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I did ping you but I didn't see a response yet


[18-Jul-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Yes I saw you had objection to me donating some COF


[18-Jul-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The education need fulfillment gets capped by ART and PAR fulfillment


[18-Jul-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(Comfort and Culture)


[18-Jul-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and just 1 item in UNI actually should reach >90% Education fulfillment, so any excess gets capped by Comfort and Culture


[18-Jul-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so adding two actually ends up wasting the resources, which probably isn't intended


[18-Jul-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	This is known, and part of the reason I'm pushing to build the ACA


[18-Jul-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	A source of both comfort and culture, with upkeeps much easier to obtain


[18-Jul-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah but like...don't waste the resources and put your own coffers in even more debt by filling multiple UNI items lol


[18-Jul-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	that money is basically down the drain so not much we can do now


[18-Jul-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	My coffers aint in debt. Proxion would have a serious problem if they were XD


[18-Jul-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I thought you raised taxes because government was negative


[18-Jul-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Goverment is.


[18-Jul-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	yeah that's what I mean


[18-Jul-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Who do you think it is negative to though?


[18-Jul-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	because governmental funds are what ends up being wasted


[18-Jul-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Not when those items are kept off the books


[18-Jul-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Anything the government doesn't cover I assume the governor themselves uses their personal reserves for


[18-Jul-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which would be the motivation for using resources efficiently


[18-Jul-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Speaking of, I know Joro donated some HD, but you'll need to let me know what you filled while I was away and what Proxion owes you.


[18-Jul-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh don't worry about it, those were legit donations lol


[18-Jul-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	you can see them in the upkeep history, it's publicly available, if you want to keep a complete record in the accounting sheet


[18-Jul-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although don't worry about the compensation


[18-Jul-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	The problem with that is that it updates to the most recent each time. I noticed with something I put in myself it said I had a bunch of donations "2 days ago" when it was only actually one of those items I'd put in.


[18-Jul-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	oh right, yeah it keeps a rolling total of the past like...30 days or something


[18-Jul-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Looking at the history the ones for PAR are pretty accurate (96 FOD from Jor / 90 FOD from myself) + ART (20 MHP, 12 HOG from Jor / 20 UTS, 10 MHP from myself)


[18-Jul-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think I might go into RFabs to help get the mats for the ACA lol, although I might be able to get some together from corpmates as well


[18-Jul-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I have some of the RBH and RSE, but it's away out at Archlight. I think I should be able to source some internally too. I also have all the DEC bar 5


[18-Jul-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Then the final step will be to turn my proxion base into a VIT factory...


[18-Jul-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Are you sure about VIT, it's not very cost effective lol


[18-Jul-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	For Art Cafe DW / GL are probably the best


[18-Jul-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Yes, they will be. Followed by COF.


[18-Jul-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	VIT in an ACA at Kawa prices would be like 2933 cis/day; COF is 3266/day; DW is 417/day; GL is 1100/day; OLF is 1933/day; DEC is 5000/day


[18-Jul-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	COF? COF you say?


[18-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think COF ends up not being great because of how much you need, despite it being relatively straightforward to make


[18-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I feel like COF is better used for consumption by PIO workers as a result for the most part


[18-Jul-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	rather than upkeep


[18-Jul-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although if your production / supply chain is effective enough to make COF like 2-3 times cheaper than KAWA price then it's probably fine


[18-Jul-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Kawa price for COF on prox is currently like 245cis


[18-Jul-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	per unit


[18-Jul-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	as of late though it seems from the CX there's a sort of universal coffee shortage


[18-Jul-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	may be better to restore the cof supplies than to make them disappear in upkeep, at least with the current supplies imo :B


[18-Jul-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Probably becuse COF price is 245/u.. that's not a lucrative enough price for a lot to make in bulk and sell


[18-Jul-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I mean it's very lucrative on the CX right now lol


[18-Jul-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's not worth dumping into upkeep currently is what I'm saying


[18-Jul-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and I'm also saying even if it were 245/u it's still not worth dumping into upkeep


[18-Jul-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	since that's still almost 6x less efficient than DW


[18-Jul-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You need like 17 DW per day or 13.3 COF per day in an ACA


[18-Jul-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and DW is like 25/u vs COF's 245/u (the relative prices are about the same on CX with ~50DW:500COF)


[18-Jul-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so cof is kinda not worth, tbh sell the coffee to the thirsty people instead

**NorseFTX**:	Hrm. I think I'll @ you or DM you next time @Dover, I didn't want to excessively deluge you with pings, but shortly after the previous POPR last week, I did write in the fowl discord chat that we frequently speak in that we would probably need to run a Happiness Program again this week (since upkeep wasn't gonna be sufficient to restore worker populations). I noticed from this week's POPR that no program was run so I'm guessing you just missed it, rip. x: I can ping next time, although I don't think it's really my job to do that either.


[19-Jul-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Hopefully it's not too bothersome if I ping you. I'm just trying to help x:


[19-Jul-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	you raised the taxes and reported the increased revenue you received, but didn't use the taxes to run any program so I'm actually legitimately confused


[19-Jul-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jul-22 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Obviously you don't have the capability to run the program, but your previous stance was they were a waste of money.

**NorseFTX**:	I said they were a waste of money if we could meet the upkeep


[20-Jul-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Although we didn't meet the upkeep last week so I mentioned that we might need to run a happiness plan


[20-Jul-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(The upkeep needs to be filled starting at the beginning of the week, since the fraction of time upkeep is met also matters for how much percentage benefit is received, and it wasn't sufficient from the very beginning so we wouldn't be able to meet it regardless, which is why I sent the message at the start of the week)


[20-Jul-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yeah as you point out it's impossible for me to run a government program since I'm not governor; it might just make it easier for me to help out directly if I run


[20-Jul-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But why didn't we meet the upkeep last week when you said you were going to monitor it while I was away?


[20-Jul-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Since we're also having this conversation in another channel, I'll go ahead and duplicate the text here just so people know what the follow up was


[20-Jul-22 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	We did fill it as best we could; As I explained, from the very beginning of the cycle when you left, the upkeep wasn't filled, so regardless of how much we filled it in the coming days, counting the first 3 cycle being missed (3/7 days), what we added would only be ~40% effective.


[20-Jul-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Additionally, due to how Happiness Averaging works, and the low happiness of previous weeks, the effective happiness would be pulled down by the values from the prior weeks


[20-Jul-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so for a brief buffer period, even the upkeep I mentioned will NOT be sufficient


[20-Jul-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Which is why I had mentioned the following: "may even still need to run the happiness program at least once more due to how bad the happiness numbers were the previous weeks, due to how happiness averaging works"


[20-Jul-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I covered for you as best I could, if we didn't act I think we would've lost multiple dozens of ENG / SCI due to lack of PAR fulfillment


[20-Jul-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so the damage is less bad but again there was literally nothing I could do to change the past happiness values lol

**Crackerjack685**:	while yes we will lose a lot of ad's, think of the time you will save, and the headache's you will avoid from people sniping ad's you had meant for a friend or corp member,


[28-Jul-22 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**silentium_noxe**:	yeah, I agree with you


[28-Jul-22 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You won't actually miss any ads that are intended for the open market


[28-Jul-22 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	instead, all the clutter will go away


[28-Jul-22 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**silentium_noxe**:	I am sure that the players will begin to give preference to closed contracts. The open market will live only at the expense of free or basic accounts.


[28-Jul-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But ..


[28-Jul-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	a closed account implies a specific recipient


[28-Jul-22 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	that already happens on the LM


[28-Jul-22 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	that's largely what you're seeing


[28-Jul-22 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you have a product that you genuinely want to sell to whoever wants it at your price, you're not going to make a closed contract


[28-Jul-22 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Those sell ads for WIN and ALE will still be there, but the buy ads for C at 205, half the market price, will probably become closed


[28-Jul-22 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This LM is so polluted with contracts priced so far from the market I can't tell if they're corp deals or peopel with no idea whats going on


[28-Jul-22 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	cant wait till they're gone


[28-Jul-22 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crackerjack685**:	wont be seeing any of those from me for a little bit @neke86 lol im stockpile for a little while loll


[28-Jul-22 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crackerjack685**:	alot of the C ads for 205 were all corp ad's esp by me, that being said i do have PE available to the LM occasionally


[28-Jul-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah that's what I'm saying, those will go away, but it's not going to affect the "open market" at all


[28-Jul-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	because no one on the open market would ever take them


[28-Jul-22 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crackerjack685**:	yeah it will be nice not to have to search the lm for ads that are intended for corp members, will bring more real time player to player interactions i think

[28-Jul-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once*


[28-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I would do it sooner... but I'm stretched on funds after a couple large expenditures (base, buildings, STL ship, etc.)


[28-Jul-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**silentium_noxe**:	But GAL expensive then NAB


[28-Jul-22 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is a lot the goes into that evaluation


[28-Jul-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	BOR is not a local... so unless your extracting it and transporting it over... there will always be a greater amount of risk than GAL.

**neke86**:	If you’re looking to upgrade ships in the coming future and wish to purchase SSC, drop me a line. I’ll be selling them for 250. I had listed 700 in advance of the update but they were just bought and re-listed by a scalper. Don’t pay 450/u, I can easily service what you need for upgrades.


[02-Aug-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	POPR is looking much better, some people appear to have taken down some of their SCI buildings as well hmm. Ideally we keep a buffer of something like 10-15% unemployment for each worker tier so people can feel comfortable building towards those production tiers


[02-Aug-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Generally you wait till you've filled up your first base - the cost of a new CM is pretty high vs just building more on your current base


[03-Aug-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Fluffy2001**:	So I take it that water production on Etherwind is easier than Proxion? I don't have a feeling for the rating bars yet.


[03-Aug-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sommgaii**:	water on etherwind is definitely easier and cheaper to produce


[03-Aug-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Better to get your water there, and bring it here to use.


[03-Aug-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sommgaii**:	you might even get away with just buying from their LM and shipping it back to proxion


[03-Aug-22 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	I will look into it. Still trying to figure out the mechanism of this simulation. It's seems pretty awesome though

**ManjiTec_Ka**:	3 RIGs, 1 FRM and 1 FP is more than enough to meet the DW and RAT requirements for 220 PIO on proxion, if that's any help :)


[03-Aug-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	I think 2 RIGs, 1 FRM and 1 FP was just about enough to support 190 PIO, iirc


[03-Aug-22 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	1 FP can support ~500 pioneers


[03-Aug-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**KMF_Razgriz**:	General poll from the populace as a water producer: Are most of y'all who import water looking for raw H2O for agriculture, or DW for consumption?


[03-Aug-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	agriculture... DW prices have been low


[04-Aug-22 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Are we supposed to start without not enough BSE?


[04-Aug-22 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Hey there


[04-Aug-22 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Just following they startup guide and ran out before building a hab... so no production =(


[04-Aug-22 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Both starter ships are carrying times, re both unloaded?


[04-Aug-22 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Yeah


[04-Aug-22 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	what starter package was selected?


[04-Aug-22 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	I think the carbon farmer, but now I'm not sure


[04-Aug-22 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	I built a farmstead and a rig, not realizing I needed the hab first


[04-Aug-22 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are 2 farming based starters: Victualler and Carbon farmer


[04-Aug-22 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	If you need to you can COLIQ


[04-Aug-22 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If the buildings were made within 1 hour, you can demo them for 100% returned resources


[04-Aug-22 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	which will restart you


[04-Aug-22 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	RNGzero is also correct


[04-Aug-22 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	I started last night, ran in to this issue, so just gave up for a until now


[04-Aug-22 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	COLIQ


[04-Aug-22 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	What will it restart?


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll be able to select differnt planet and starting package


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or restart here


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	I'm on Proxion, and there weren't many slots let


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	The starter package should start with enough of everything for your first few buildings


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	slots don;t matter for your 1st base


[04-Aug-22 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	The slots don't matter for your 1st base


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can even get a base on promitor as your 1st


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Oh, so I can just restart then?


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Will I have enough BSE next time?


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	*package


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	You should have enough, yes


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	As long as you follow the reccomended stuff.. yes


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hiphopopotamus**:	Cool, I'll do it now. Thanks


[04-Aug-22 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EyangKodok**:	@Fluffy2001 no, Balancing Production with workers takes PRUNner :)


[04-Aug-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	or something similiar


[04-Aug-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	sorry, dont get it


[04-Aug-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	there is a 3rd party software where you can use it to plan your expansion, to prevent over production etc-etc


[04-Aug-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	Now I see, I think I read something like this. Will check it out again


[04-Aug-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	it will show you how much your productuion building produce and consume, you just gotta match it with your EXT or COL or whatever


[04-Aug-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	Makes sense, I guess even after 12 days I still have a lot to learn... *cough*cough*


[04-Aug-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	PRUNner help me plan things when i just start and rn


[04-Aug-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fluffy2001**:	just notice when they are starting to run out, the efficiency goes down and production times increase... now it's back to 68% from 45 and 35 units of DW are going to be done in time.. I guess it was just a too close call

[04-Aug-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dover**:	Well folks, we've reached the final day of the election. I haven't done much shouting this time, I'd been hoping to let the numbers do the talking. POPI has grown, with no open jobs. The COGC has remained active constantly. However, if the planet feels it's time for a change, then so be it. It's been a privilege to serve what I feel is the best planet in PrUn, and I hope that she remains well treated.

[12-Aug-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If things do stay the way they are currently, I'll put together a statement so people will know what to expect if I do become governor, although the short of it is: 1) I plan to fill CoGC upkeep within 24h of each cycle, and will notify if otherwise; 2) POPI upgrades for Art Gallery > Wildlife Park > Art Cafe > Safety Stations will be under way; I'm willing to donate personally to help improve these infrastructure buildings so that upkeep on Proxion is more efficient; 3) After each POPR I'll provide an assessment and plan for the next upcoming report; 4) All citizens are free at any time to discuss anything regarding Proxion and planetary matters with me.

**NorseFTX**:	Time to immediately enact my evil plan of reducing Warehouse fees by half from 200 to 100. It seems not to let me make it go under 100 though, it says 100-2500 is the limit.


[12-Aug-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Warehouse fees are now reduced down to 100 cis o:


[12-Aug-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Some post-election words are in order--


[12-Aug-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The election has finished! First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for their support, and would like to also thank the prior governor, Dover, for their hard work as governor over the previous periods. I will do my best to live up to the expectations of those who put their faith in me.


[12-Aug-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'd like to let the citizens know that I plan to do the following, in hopes that it will improve planetary upkeep moving forward, and avoid CoGC Strikes and dips in workforce population that have happened in the past:


[12-Aug-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	-- CoGC upkeep will be filled within 24 hours of the beginning of each upkeep cycle. If I am unable to fill CoGC at this time, I will notify all citizens in the Proxion Global site chat and provide a time frame for when it can be filled, or whether assistance is needed.


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	-- POPI upkeep - The following infrastructure upgrades are due to help increase upkeep efficiency cost-wise:


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	1) Art Gallery (Add 2)


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	2) Wildlife Park (Add 1)


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	3) Art Cafe (Add 1)


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	4) Safety Station (Add 1-3)


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	-- At the beginning of every POPR week (after population reports come out), at this time an assessment can already be made for whether a governmental program will be necessary, and I will mention in Global chat what actions / plans will be taken. At this time, others can also feel free to chime in on how they feel about where workforce population should be going, and any needs they have.


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	-- At any time, citizens of Proxion are free to discuss planetary matters with me (such as POPI upgrades, warehouse expansion, tax discussion), and I will give suggestions proper consideration and respond to the best of my ability.


[12-Aug-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	In addition, the updated Proxion Governorship Accounting spreadsheet is now available for copy, so other governors who might wish to use it as a template may do so.

[12-Aug-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	AIC doesn't appear on my Finances


[12-Aug-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Martian Coin (AIC) ok


[12-Aug-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	How do I turn my CIS assets into local currency?


[12-Aug-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh there are four types of currency, CIS, AIC, ICA, and nCC


[12-Aug-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	CIS is actually the local currency for Proxion


[12-Aug-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	There are differnt types of currency. Benten uses CIS mosty while other regions use their own


[12-Aug-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	AIC is the currency for the Antares area


[12-Aug-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Ok, I am in Proxion but I guess I was looking at an Antares commodity exchange


[12-Aug-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You'll want the Benten Station exchange for Proxion


[12-Aug-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	that one trades primarily in CIS


[12-Aug-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Arclight also trades in CIS but it's much farther away


[12-Aug-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	early into the game, tune out the other CXs until you are ready to buy, sell, or trade in that region


[12-Aug-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Benten station is just 1 jump away from Proxion


[12-Aug-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Oh thank you very much I see the Benten Commodity Exchange!


[12-Aug-22 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	\o/


[12-Aug-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the global help chat is also a great place for questions. More players there to answer


[12-Aug-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So I think I bough some BSE from Benten since my balance went down but I guess I have to send one my my 2 ship over there to pick it up?


[12-Aug-22 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, you'll want to eventually send a ship to pickup the goods. Just make sure that you take products along to make the trip  profitable


[12-Aug-22 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the faster a ship goes the more fuel it burns... so when sending a ship out... ensure you're not using too much fuel


[12-Aug-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	IT's my first order (BSE to make an Extractor since the planet has limstone), so now learning to move a ship. Let's see. THanks btw!


[12-Aug-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Aug-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	@NorseFTX why did you increase tax on the lowest margin industry here, Agriculture, rather than on the sizeable high margin TEC/ENG/SCI populations??


[12-Aug-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh I didn't touch taxes at all yet


[12-Aug-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I just decreased the warehouse rental fee from 200 -> 100


[12-Aug-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I do think I might decrease the PIO taxes overall, though, and want to discuss that


[12-Aug-22 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I notice Katoa has TEC / ENG / SCI taxes at 270 / 600 / 1000


[12-Aug-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Aug-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The minimum is 10 cis


[12-Aug-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I do think that increased taxes for higher tier workers makes some sense; it effectively taxes the richer players


[12-Aug-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	while the newer players who are using PIO/SET workforce for the most part are unaffected


[12-Aug-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I actually can slightly decrease taxes for lower tier workers since some will be made up by the high tier worker taxes


[12-Aug-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lexip**:	The Planetary Projects are new features added to our planet by the players contributing? Will there be more of those in the future?


[13-Aug-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Or maybe on the other planets in this system?


[13-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	planets within each system were set at universe generation. So there won't be any more. If new resources are added they would be "discovered" on existing planets


[13-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lexip**:	(Thanks RNGzero for the info on projects)


[13-Aug-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	He Gov is to use the taxes to support the buildings etc. I heard a Gov at another planet ran off with the months taxes and did nothing.  I am sure our new Gov will do a respectful good job. Look back in chat he mentioned some of his aims.


[13-Aug-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So just like in real life scamming happens ;) Thanks Grandpa_Canuck!


[13-Aug-22 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	It is very rate as if it gets done all will blacklist the player. It will be impossible for them to ever get elected on that planet again. So very very rate. No worries here of that though. This Gov is a respected member of his corporation and the community.


[13-Aug-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Oh you have 2 planets! Benten Katoa seem to be a logic second as it is the "big planet" in the "next neighborhood".  Why did you decide that planet?


[13-Aug-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yeah they provide ways to ensure that lowest tier consumables are always available in some form, and also provide a way for people to sell off / get rid of their product if no players demand it and more space is needed

**RNGzero**:	The HQ bonus is based on the faction area your HQ is in


[15-Aug-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the % of the HQ bonus is the faction % + % modifier from unused permits


[15-Aug-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	My overall plan for Proxion for the Citizens is to first ensure that workforce tiers of all tiers (Pioneers, Settlers, Technicians, Engineers, and Scientists) are available to Proxion corporations as needed, and will fulfill the population infrastructure upkeep as needed


[15-Aug-22 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	To help improve efficiency for workforce satisfaction, the next goal(s) in infrastructure upgrades is to:


[15-Aug-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	- Build an additional Art Gallery (provides Culture need fulfillment, which is important for ENG/SCI)


[15-Aug-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	- Build an additional Wildlife Park (provides Comfort need fulfillment, which is important for TEC/ENG/SCI, and also helps increase the Education need fulfillment cap which is needed for SCI)


[15-Aug-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	- Build an additional Safety Station (provides Safety need fulfillment, important for all tiers)


[15-Aug-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	approximately in that order, although we probably will want two Art Galleries


[15-Aug-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I am also open to other suggestions, such as expansion of the Warehouse if people wish for that


[15-Aug-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I also would like to evaluate how viable it would be to lower taxes for the PIO/SET tiers, although to be safe I'll let another full week play out since I've only been governor for 3 days and taxes follow 7-day cycles

[15-Aug-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I've been playing this game for 3 days so I have a lot to learn before making any suggestions but I took notes of your plan. Hopefully I can help soon.


[15-Aug-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I was wondering, since we all have the same planet, we are all basically thinking the same things right? Proxion has ok LST so extractors and BMP for MCG production or bfabs?


[15-Aug-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh @Lexip you might want to take note of the Chamber of Global Commerce on Proxion, which gives all Agriculture a +25% bonus


[15-Aug-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The HQ bonus is pretty minor in comparison, most of what's done on Proxion is Agriculture


[15-Aug-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's one of few fertile planets in the Benten area


[15-Aug-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Oh I didn't know that.


[15-Aug-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So the CoGC is what influences the direction of the planet? But it can be voted on unlike the Faction bonus who is fixed?


[15-Aug-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Right


[15-Aug-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	As an individual company you can choose to change your own HQ Faction bonus


[15-Aug-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	For example, I started on Proxion, but I added another base on Etherwind


[15-Aug-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I set my HQ to Etherwind so that I would get Resource Extraction / Chemistry / Fuel refining bonuses instead of Manufacturing


[15-Aug-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(since I wasn't doing much Manufacturing at the time)


[15-Aug-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Also it seems that the CoGC has to be payed by willing participant. So those who don't contribute still get the bonus and those who payed actually were taxed in a way by the upkeep?


[15-Aug-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Oh I see Etherwind has no faction so it gets the 2% chem extract ... so that HQ bonus applies to all your other planets account wide?


[15-Aug-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yup


[15-Aug-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	@Lexip For CoGC, this is what the governmental taxes are for (which are production fees, warehouse fees, and LM ad fees)--they are meant to pay for planet-wide upkeep such as for the CoGC. And yeah, everyone benefits from the CoGC without needing to contribute to it themselves (so long as it's filled).


[15-Aug-22 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So the taxes cover the most of the cost but when Fluff Supplies gave some extra RAT then that was an actual additional donation.


[15-Aug-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Thanks Fluff!

[16-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	You do not want to put a RIG on Proxion @QrazyAbc


[16-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	(Also, free accounts can't do private transactions to avoid dummy accounts spamming goods to another--requires PRO/Basic to do so.  You can buy from the CX if you want, though)


[16-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I mean you can when you're starting out. But long term it's more effective to buy water or extract it on Etherwind and ship it here.


[16-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Definitely buy water instead of pulling it from Proxion. It costs more to feed the workers working the RIG than it would cost you to just buy it from the CX.


[16-Aug-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QrazyAbc**:	ok thanks for the tips


[16-Aug-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Hi!


[16-Aug-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Yesterday NorseFTX explained to me that Proxion CoGC bonus was Agriculture because it is one of few fertile planets in the Benten area.


[16-Aug-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So as a beginner importing H2O (like you just mentioned) + having a Farmstead seems to be the most profitable. Also extracting the LST in the meantime.


[16-Aug-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Maybe also buying Fe to operate a PP1 to make bfabs


[16-Aug-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	(with the LST)


[16-Aug-22 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yes I recently realized that using RIGs on Proxion requires so many water wasting workers that the math just doesn't work (after following a startup guide recommending 2 RIGs). So did I mess up bad enough to do-over after about a week of this?


[16-Aug-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Definitely not. There are plenty more mistakes to be made first XD


[16-Aug-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It' not a mistake, you just got less profit ... but you got knowledge, best ressource!


[16-Aug-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can only fit 63 FE in a starter ship type of heavy


[16-Aug-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's do able... but it's not a lot of fun


[16-Aug-22 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	It's completely viable. Been doing it since the beginning.


[16-Aug-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	i suggest if you going to mine LST, may want to sell it instead


[16-Aug-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Proxion makes enough LST to cover pre-fabs plus anything else a starting player would use it for (like FLX or MCG)


[16-Aug-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	no specialization?


[16-Aug-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	starting players don;t need to worry too much about specializing early considering the faction bonus is manufacturing


[16-Aug-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	What is the specialization?


[16-Aug-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players in Hortus or Moria would align earlier to their faction bonus


[16-Aug-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm sure that depends on the Corp


[16-Aug-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I'll think about the FP then.


[16-Aug-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Corp cost money?


[16-Aug-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	maybe, i never join other corp soo

[16-Aug-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	join corp may cost money, but usually not much


[16-Aug-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I though being a shareholder of something was interesting to investigate but it's simply a guild group I guess for now.


[16-Aug-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Corps can be nice, but learning to rely on yourself to keep your bases afloat is a valuable skill.


[16-Aug-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	whats help from being in corp is the discord, where fellow corp mate can coorporate and trade stuff, you may can Pre-Order stuff


[16-Aug-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	tho youll need BASIC or PRO for it to work, as being in corp rely heavyly in LM and CONTD


[16-Aug-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	1.00 CIS my FIN says "Purchase of corporation shares".


[16-Aug-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	yup, but that does nothing to your gameplay if you dont have PRO or BASIC


[16-Aug-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Ha ok.. not PRO yet so LM are a mystery still :p


[16-Aug-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	just mean you can trade stuff in planet


[16-Aug-22 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	also you can loan your tranport to other corp mate for hefty cash


[16-Aug-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Yes being autonomous while at the same time thinking about contributing to a group is a necessary balance.


[16-Aug-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So then the idea is to compare bfabs/LCT business to the agricultural since I mean the planets is setup that way after all. But if I ditch Agriculture I'll understand why.


[16-Aug-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	yeah, but chance are you just need to sell stuff within the corp and buy from the corp (atleast in KAWA and FOWL while doing the trade it's MUCH much more cheaper than CX)


[16-Aug-22 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I see.


[16-Aug-22 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Taking more notes!


[16-Aug-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	ALSO! you can take loan!!! which will strap  rocket to your finance and launch your gameplay to mid game real fast


[16-Aug-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	currently the loan system is a self made firute where it's build on trust between corp mate


[16-Aug-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Talking to me actually cost money. That's how I make millions. I'll bill you right now.


[16-Aug-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	;)


[16-Aug-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	i can keep preaching about why bein in corp is great, but i understand you want to become self made milloners or love how you currrently do stuff


[16-Aug-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	xD


[16-Aug-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Actually I think these game always give huge advantages to groups helping each other than lone wolves.


[16-Aug-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	But being a lone wolf for a while makes you a much better team player when you do.


[16-Aug-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	(when you do join to contribute)


[16-Aug-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	When I read the "corporation and shareholders" language they use in this game I though you could own a % of a corporation that produce goods and somehow you could acquire other corporations etc... but I guess it's probably a nightmare in terms of implementation.


[16-Aug-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	bill sent


[16-Aug-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	XD


[16-Aug-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	;)


[16-Aug-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	share holder thing is currently meant nothing, and i dont think you can acquire other company or corp


[16-Aug-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Have to go, thanks for sharing your knowledge! Have fun!


[16-Aug-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	hf!


[16-Aug-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	@Lexip Right now, 2 FRM, 1FP, 2 RIG - all on Proxion. Those RIG buildings are not pulling their weight at all. Financially I'm about as broke as possible haha.. A little bit of RAT to sell on CX.


[16-Aug-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	yeh RIG´s on Prox are no good


[16-Aug-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	better get it from the CX and make more good you can sell


[16-Aug-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah that's what I know now. With the sunk cost on those 2 RIG I'm not sure if they're worth keeping around burning up PIO time, or they should just be torn down. I wish we got more back for demoishing buildings.


[16-Aug-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Oh actually it does give most back, nevermind.


[16-Aug-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you accidently make a building, 100% of the resources are returned if demolished within an hour


[16-Aug-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Past that point :)


[16-Aug-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Good to know though.


[16-Aug-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	otherwise it depends on the age of the building (every material decays at different rates)


[16-Aug-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	So if it makes little sense to put a RIG on low H2O worlds, I assume the same applies for other resources, so what's the point of the game even having low % resources at all?


[16-Aug-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Ah there are some low % resources such as H on Umbra, but originally before people could make the materials to colonize gas giants, that was the best H you could get


[16-Aug-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Low % resources basically cost you to extract, but in some cases if it's otherwise very difficult to get, it might be worth the cost (at least until better alternatives are available)


[16-Aug-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	For H2O though yeah it's widely available on the CX so it's better to buy from there


[16-Aug-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	It is a choice between transport costs vrs extraction costs sometimes.


[16-Aug-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	That as well o: As you get more bases, shipping starts becoming a bottleneck


[16-Aug-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Transport cost seems to be the opposing force that helps make low % resources viable, but I can't tell yet whether it's a strong enough force.


[16-Aug-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah it depends a lot on the resource itself too, and how heavy / difficult it is to ship


[16-Aug-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	With LST for example, Prox looks like it's right about in the middle for abundance. Tough to gauge whether that means it's worth extracting.


[16-Aug-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	So I feel like it's pushing me to super-specialize, no variety at all, just spam FRM and FP. Horizontal growth basically. But I wanted a more vertical company with a lot of variety, the opposite of what the game is steering towards.


[16-Aug-22 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I actually started very vertically


[16-Aug-22 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Amazinguy** joined.*


[16-Aug-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I guess it's possible but it feels non-optimal. At least on Prox.


[16-Aug-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think its still quite viable to build vertically (and gives yourself more of a safety net), it might cost a little more or be less efficient but you can also guarantee for yourself what you need; just make sure not to run yourself red and choose what to do wisely based on what is available in the region


[16-Aug-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yes it is never truly optimal to build vertically due to the Experts system


[16-Aug-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You can have up to 6 Experts active total, and up to 5 in a single industry on any given base


[16-Aug-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It is still optimal to build vertically across bases, but less so within a single base


[16-Aug-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I'm still going to try and go vertical as much as I can once able, it's just unfortunate that it's going to slow down an already slow early game.


[16-Aug-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Experts give a bonus only to a single industry, and give better returns the more experts you have, making it better to specialize bases in the long run


[16-Aug-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I think I'm up to speed on the expert system thing. Enough to have some criticisms of it, but that's another topic.


[16-Aug-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah i think going vertical to start with to build yourself a safety net before specializing makes sense for a beginner


[16-Aug-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Oh really


[16-Aug-22 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Especially if you dont have the support of a corp to cover you if your specialty product experiences a dip in the market


[16-Aug-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	But everyone's saying "No RIG on Prox" - we also can't produce other production inputs - hard to see how I can go vertical early on, from Prox.


[16-Aug-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	As a beginner it's hard to specialize in multiple things since you only have one base, and diversifying to protect yourself from market fluctuations if you have no corp backing to rely on makes sense imo


[16-Aug-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh yeah dont do RIG on prox


[16-Aug-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Learning that one the hard way!


[16-Aug-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Even if building vertical, that wouldn't be the vertical I'd go for on Prox because you lose money lol


[16-Aug-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yep


[16-Aug-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	No worries i did the exact same thing


[16-Aug-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The beginner guide told me to rip


[16-Aug-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I followed the starter advice a little too naively


[16-Aug-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I ended up doing a COLIQ because i had a better idea what to do and wasn't all that far in


[16-Aug-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Done that once, probably no need to again but it might be on the table I guess.


[16-Aug-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If you're not too far in the hole it's possibly still salvageable, although a fresh start also returns all the capital you began with and can possible get you farther more quickly. It's up to you to judge :P


[16-Aug-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	*possibly


[16-Aug-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Using the FRM to make HCP and INC to become a Carbon Farmer ? Any viable on here you think?


[16-Aug-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Could go either way - now running 2 RIG here am I just flat out burning cash? Or is it worth leaving them running for a few more days until I can shift those 60 PIO to something else? (SInce I've already got the things built...)


[16-Aug-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Above msg was @NorseFTX. No idea if carbon farm is good here.


[16-Aug-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	How much Fuel left do you have?


[16-Aug-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Plenty of everything I think for at least a week or two.


[16-Aug-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Carbon farming isn't bad, since Agriculture tends to be the limitng factor for scaling C production


[16-Aug-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Ok good to know. Limiting factors (or bottlenecks) I also hard to evaluate for a beginner.


[16-Aug-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I must say it is VERY strange that transporting water, which is extremely heavy, is more cost effective than pulling it out of the planet you're on. NASA would be very confused. That's kinda why I fell into that trap.


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	h2o is heavy ? xD


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Lol yeah, water is actually on the lighter side compared to most other things in Prun


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Use the technique where you sell half your fuel to get the material to rebuild properly.


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	probably because it counts units of water differently, it's 0.2t / 0.2m3 per unit H2O


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Just speaking in IRL rocketry / space travel terms.


[16-Aug-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	well in RL it is xD but hear you can ship 2.5k in a Beginner ship


[16-Aug-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	For the game I've no doubt you're right.


[16-Aug-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	and only 222 C


[16-Aug-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	@Nerva If you have a buffer of H2O available already to last your FRMs, I'd take the RIGs off now so you aren't burning consumables running them


[16-Aug-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah that's what I'm thinking Norse. Almost 400 H2O sitting here.


[16-Aug-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	if you think about it 2.5k H2O woud supply your FRM´s on a 1permit base for like 2-3 weeks


[16-Aug-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Rigs! Gone!


[16-Aug-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think of a unit of H2O in prun as 200ml of water


[16-Aug-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	~200g, or 0.2kg, ~0.2t


[16-Aug-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Remember how much H2O you need to make your drinking water as well.


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	*0.0002t


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah you want to make sure you have enough for your consumables and FRM production


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	0.2t woud be 200kg


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	nvm 1 unit of H2O is 200L


[16-Aug-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	so 200L of H2O


[16-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	We have to suspend real world physics sometimes for the sake of game balance  lol


[16-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You can probably calculate your H2O burn rate and plan to get enough during your next benten station run


[16-Aug-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I think DW is what broke the math on those RIGs. RIGs exploded now.


[16-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	rip the RIGs


[16-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You can also purchase H2O on Etherwind if you're willing to make that flight


[16-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	https://github.com/Jacudibu/PRUNner/ that coud help you to calculate your H2O burn better


[16-Aug-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I think I'll be fine. 70 DW and 385 H2O in stock.


[16-Aug-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although Etherwind is quite a bit farther away and you probably would want to be able to get a full load


[16-Aug-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm pretty sure most of the H2O on the benten CX comes from Etherwind


[16-Aug-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Probably too poor for a full load.


[16-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	yeah that'll probably need to wait til you grow larger


[16-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I had a problem paying production license fees a few days ago hahah.


[16-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Ahh yeah you want to keep a small CIS buffer for production fees


[16-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Next round I think I'm lowering the PIO/SET tax rates


[16-Aug-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Emphasis on the small in my case lol


[16-Aug-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	@nerva look into you CONTS


[16-Aug-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah, it's actually one thing I noticed is killing me ATM due to my inept planning (didn't know those fees existed).


[16-Aug-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Yes you are only trying to make more Agricultural Products than Fuel cost and make a few trips to catch up and reach full load budget trips.


[16-Aug-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	CONTS?


[16-Aug-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	CONTS = command to see all your Contracts


[16-Aug-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	On the left side bar


[16-Aug-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Ah - I see, thanks


[16-Aug-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	and take the on i jsut snt you ^^


[16-Aug-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Working on figuring that out :)


[16-Aug-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	EyangKodok that is very generous but being a non Pro I think I can't accept that contract ;)


[16-Aug-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I've got the Pro stuff going here, but the contract looks like it only has Close and Reject - I guess i'm missing something.


[16-Aug-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	close is to take it


[16-Aug-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Close is locked for me so that's the validation (closing a contract)


[16-Aug-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Oh I think I got it, thanks very much!


[16-Aug-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Well what is the % interest on it ;)


[16-Aug-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Hehe - all I see is 1 CIS payment. Didn't see any fine print but maybe I signed away my first born.


[16-Aug-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	yes i take your first born how much is it xD


[16-Aug-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Haha.. probably worthless to be honest. i.e. imaginary


[16-Aug-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Well we expect great things from you Nerva! Take over the system!


[16-Aug-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	No pressure!


[16-Aug-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh wow we have quite a few unemployed SCI; my original unemployment goal was 10-15% so I might cool off the SCI for a little bit until they are utilized


[16-Aug-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Currently we're at 17.6% SCI unemployment


[16-Aug-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	Due to request, we're now in the process of upgrading our Warehouse! Currently it's at lv4, so it should gain 1 more extra Rental unit (max 1500/1500 space) at level 5


[18-Aug-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If anyone has 48 BBH or 40 TRU, I'm willing to purchase them for the upgrade; all the other pieces are done. Please let me know if you have them available and we can discuss pricing.


[18-Aug-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm also willing to take fractions of the full amount as well if you have a smaller quantity you're willing to sell, just let me know.

**Nerva**:	@EyangKodok I believe a financial "period" is one week. I had the same question and I think I read that on a forum or something... I do wish it was clearer. The other important quesstion on that is when does the period start. The claim was 00:00 GMT on Monday IIRC.


[20-Aug-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	But I haven't been able to confirm any of that really since mine is always lots of negative numbers (hopefully that is temporary). haha


[20-Aug-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I believe you are correct on the start of the period time and it is 1 week


[20-Aug-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I am GMT-5 and it always resets late Sunday night for me.


[20-Aug-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Cool. Yeah hopefully one day we'll be able to adjust that and pick a date period, but from IRL development experience I understand why it's not a priority yet. Good amount of work with endless potential features to be added.

**Rwinner16**:	Most games have being using Z time as it's the international standard.


[20-Aug-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	And if you think of a week, ignoring the traditional calendar view of Sunday-Sat, you'll see that it makes more sense to run it Mon-Sun.


[20-Aug-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Work week, school week, business week all starts on Monday, and shut down for the "weekend" which runs through Sunday. How can Sunday be a week end, when it's actually a calendar "week start"?


[20-Aug-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	lol. Well the Jewish faith started that I think.


[20-Aug-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I have always looked at the term weekend as like bookends. So Sat and Sun are one on each end.

**Lexip**:	GrandpaCanuck yep found it.


[20-Aug-22 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@EyangKodok Yes I guess 90% of the interest of games like this is actually the not-solo part.


[20-Aug-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	But at first you want to do your little trades and crafting on your side of the universe and at your own pace.


[20-Aug-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Once people rely on you for production then I guess there is some extra pressure.


[20-Aug-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Grandpa_Canuck too bad you're a little early with the NS contract, I might be interested but I'm a bit too early-stage to help with that yet... maybe that'll change in a few weeks or something.


[20-Aug-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Is there a general consensus on whether it's "worth" feeding your PIO employees COF and PWO? Or is that just an "it depends" answer?


[20-Aug-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Suika**:	You can check the numbers with PRUNner, PWO is always worth it afaik, COF is expensive but should pay for itself but its not as significant as PWO.

**NorseFTX**:	FYI the following changes have been made for taxes!


[21-Aug-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Agriculture PIO and SET taxes have been lowered from 20 -> 15 and 25 -> 20 respectively


[21-Aug-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	All TEC/ENG/SCI tier taxes have been equalized at 30/40/50


[21-Aug-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	This week revenue wise we have actually been doing alright even including the expenses for the warehouse expansion, so I think this decrease is still sustainable.


[21-Aug-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	We'll let this run for the next cycle and see what happens


[21-Aug-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also tried to reduce the local market fee but it really doesn't let me put it under 50 cis rip


[21-Aug-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also as an advanced notice, I've also run a Planetary Festivities II program; since there are currently >15% unemployed SCI, there currently doesn't seem to be a need to continue growing SCI, although I'll continue increasing ENG til we reach a 10-15% unemployment buffer. Will adjust as needed!


[21-Aug-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	So expect to have loss of a few of the unemployed PIO/SET/TEC/SCI and minor gain of ENG this next POPR.


[21-Aug-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YoyoStelar**:	not bad


[21-Aug-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So some people have 15 extractors on a 3-permit base instead of such a diverse amount as you have ?


[21-Aug-22 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes


[21-Aug-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It really depends on what the player wants from that base. Larger players will tend to have more horizontal bases


[21-Aug-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I didn't expect planets to hold such an amount of buildings. Does that make lone wolves actually able to self sustain?


[21-Aug-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Do you need to use 2nd permit on second planet or max out 1rst planet with 3 permit? Then, for the second planet, do you look for synergies in resource gathering or just location for distance to CX?


[21-Aug-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Oh blueprints have a Flight simulator to evaluate the costs of travelling. So ship optimize your most solid/frequent trade routes I guess?


[21-Aug-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	to repair a building, you'll need all the repair materials


[21-Aug-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is no partial repairs


[21-Aug-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lexip**:	You mentionned Umbra a good planet for Chem, can you name maybe 1 planet for each expertise for newbies to investigate? (Electronics, Food Industries, Fuel Refining, Manufacturing, Metallurgy)


[21-Aug-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Generally, factions will have a planet with a COGC for each building catagory.


[21-Aug-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nerva**:	Really dumb question on CX trades - if you were place a buy order at a way higher price than the posted ASK orders, I assume the trade goes through at the lower ASK price (up the order book until the quantity you requested is filled) rather than your ridiculously high offer, right? I mean you're not giving out free money like this, yes?


[04-Sep-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also latest POPR is in, looks like levels of ENG / SCI are holding mostly steady, and unemployment for all tiers is at or above the 10-15% range, so I'll keep this trajectory of maintenance unless workforce demand changes/increases.


[06-Sep-22 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Thanks for the update NorseFTX!

**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Message me with your bid/trade offer


[06-Sep-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rillow22**:	if i queue to 3 recurring orders in a row dose it cycle thru them


[06-Sep-22 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	yes


[06-Sep-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	When 1 is put into production it is recreated the the bottom


[06-Sep-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Be careful though. The next recurring item "holds" the first production spot that opens up. If you don't have the inputs or whatever to start that recurring, it sits and keeps 1 production spot on hold.


[06-Sep-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The remaining queued recurrings cycle like normal for the remaining spots though. Just something to pay attention to.

[09-Sep-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	They are made with construction buildings (PP1 & PP2) ot bought at the Commodity Exchange (CX)


[09-Sep-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or*


[09-Sep-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the nearest CX is Benten Station

[09-Sep-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Welcome Xaxirs. Good thing about BSE is that one of the ingredients is on Proxion: LST


[09-Sep-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So an Extractor is a good idea. But forget about the Rig for H2O as it's not profitable at all.


[09-Sep-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a PP1 on Proxion works... but transporting FE about isn't great xD


[09-Sep-22 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Not ideal, that's true.


[09-Sep-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	One pp1 on proxion making BDE wouldn't be a *terrid*.


[09-Sep-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xaxirs**:	I have an extractor producing let already, are you saying that a pp1 producing bde would be my most ideal next step?


[09-Sep-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xaxirs**:	lst*


[09-Sep-22 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It requires going to the CX benten to get some FE since FE + LST > BSE and BBH ... and if you also get PE you get all 4 building components BDE and BTA


[09-Sep-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	But you could also sell LST (forget about FE) and get H2O at the CX to start Farming (the bonus of the planet) then you process the farming goods into Food and Drinkable water in a Food processing building.


[09-Sep-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Importing H2O to make DW is in itself profitable for the super simple setup.


[09-Sep-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Another scenario. farm and use the goods not to make food only but to incinerate and make Carbon.


[09-Sep-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	@Xaxis remember ask 45 people and you will get 8 answers. There are many paths ahead, find one you are comfortable with.


[09-Sep-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Then there is the Oxygen path that I haven't explored but the collection of it is profitable.


[09-Sep-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Just don't Rig > H2O, you will starve.


[09-Sep-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@Xaxis PRUNner is a utility software that can let you explore all options.


[09-Sep-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@HumanFork read above ;)


[09-Sep-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	yesterday started to play and build a rig, todays was asking around and was told wasnt the best for beginner, so I destroyed it, know I am missing some BSE


[09-Sep-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	What is your setup now?


[09-Sep-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	I dont have any.


[09-Sep-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	only have core module, and 2x pioneer habitations


[09-Sep-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	extract some LST / import H2O to farm or process into drinkable water ;)


[09-Sep-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Common advice is you can sell some fuel from the 2nd ship to buy stuff


[09-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	So I will need to build EXT to get LST, build FRM and import water to grow grain or soy?


[09-Sep-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Slqq** left.*


[09-Sep-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you don't need to.. but you have the option to do so


[09-Sep-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you just want to focus on farms and food.. an extractor my not be wanted


[09-Sep-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	FRM + FP (food processor) will get you RAT + DW (food and drink for your workers) you will need to buy H2O and OVE (clothing for your workers) and later COF and PWO (optional items to boost their production to 100%)


[09-Sep-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	not getting EXT means no LST so you will need to buy building materials from your farming profits to get new buildings...


[09-Sep-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	okey,for now I have building materials only for FRM and FP


[09-Sep-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I like EXT > LST and FE import because I feel like I'm using available res and building my own buildings and it show me the value ot BSE BDE BBH BTA.


[09-Sep-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Nice!


[09-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Do you have any H2O to get them started?


[09-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	New here whats this for?


[09-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	yes I actually have 20 H2O


[09-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	This chat is the chat specific for Proxion planet :)


[09-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Thank you


[09-Sep-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@mcniteblox Don't build a Rig to extract H2O it's not profitable


[09-Sep-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	^ on Proxion that is... the deposite of H2O on Proxion isn;t great


[09-Sep-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	oop


[09-Sep-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	I already did


[09-Sep-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	you can demolish it will get your stuff back, mostly


[09-Sep-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Ok


[09-Sep-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Buying H2O at the Benten CX and importing it is preferable


[09-Sep-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	I sent my ship to a station I dont think its that one


[09-Sep-22 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Oh its Antares


[09-Sep-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You have 2 ships, only one will be used for a while so you can sell the fuel while going to CX to have more kickstart money.


[09-Sep-22 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	I was planning to use the rig to produce water for the farmstead


[09-Sep-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Good idea but in this planet it's not profitable with the cost of workers.


[09-Sep-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Extracting LST is profitable and O too but you can also not extract anything and keep the building material to build FRM / FP


[09-Sep-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Ok, should i wait for the production to finish?


[09-Sep-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	H2O? sure cancel and demolish the Rig


[09-Sep-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	you have a window (buffer) called FINLA Liquid Assets, can you see it?


[09-Sep-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Ok, how do i pull a station shop?


[09-Sep-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	open a buffer (bottom NEW BFR)


[09-Sep-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	type CXL


[09-Sep-22 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Done


[09-Sep-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	you see the list of CX ?


[09-Sep-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Yes


[09-Sep-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Benten is the one clisest but you went to Antares


[09-Sep-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	you need a FINLA buffer too (it's your wallet)


[09-Sep-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Opened


[09-Sep-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	every CX has a different money... your biggest money should be for Benten.


[09-Sep-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	CIS


[09-Sep-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	but they give you free 1000 AIC for antares and ICA NCC (2 others


[09-Sep-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Is that not on Antares?


[09-Sep-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	who much do you have for CIS and AIC ?


[09-Sep-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	in your wallet


[09-Sep-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	1000 AIC


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	39,877 CIS


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	ok so you can't buy much... but alll your money is in benten


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	BEnten is CIS


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Ok


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	so senf the 2nd ship to benten ;)


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	send*


[09-Sep-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	so I can only make BEA to get PPA in FP?


[09-Sep-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	7 hours mice


[09-Sep-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Don't go too fast ... in this game it's better to save fuel


[09-Sep-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	7h proxion benten is ok but I prefer 11h... overnight


[09-Sep-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Dropped it to min for botth


[09-Sep-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@HumanFork you don't need PPA


[09-Sep-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	it's a Pull down menu


[09-Sep-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	click on the right side to see the list


[09-Sep-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	well yea there is bunch of stuff I can make, but I have no clue what?


[09-Sep-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Sorry I missread maybe


[09-Sep-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	RAT is ration... that's what you need


[09-Sep-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	But you need Farming thing to put in


[09-Sep-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	so make BEA GRN and MAI maybe and they all that into FP to make the RAT


[09-Sep-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	So I need GRN, BEA, NUT, to make RAT, well there is few variation of recipe


[09-Sep-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcniteblox**:	Started


[09-Sep-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	exactly find a combination that works ... ALG / VEG are actually made with another T2 buildin


[09-Sep-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	ohh okey, so yea, I  queue needed stuf to get RAT, gonna be few days.


[09-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It's a slow game ;)


[09-Sep-22 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	the benefit of some recipes is they are more profitable after with other buildings and some bonuses


[09-Sep-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	yea definitely, I guess in mean while I can send ships to buy more water?


[09-Sep-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@mcniteblox the buffer for Benten shop when you get there is "CX CI1"


[09-Sep-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Sure.


[09-Sep-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	or make RAT sell it and then get some more water, a little bit fuel efficient


[09-Sep-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	First trips are always a little empty but it's ok


[09-Sep-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	thank you very much for help, alone would be a struggle.


[09-Sep-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Another tip is when you guy at the CX you need your ship to be there to receive the goods in your cargo. But you can rent a warehouse there that will store even without the ship. It costs 100/week (warehouse) which is nothing. I suggest get a warehouse at all 4 CX (Benten + the other 3 where you have the 1000 AIC / NCC / ICA) and Trade the 900 left.


[09-Sep-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	buy* not guy


[09-Sep-22 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	thanks will try to remember that.


[09-Sep-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I've never been to Antares but I have turned my 900 into tens of thousands of money buying and selling items (using the warehouse) in a few weeks.


[09-Sep-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HumanFork**:	buy low sell high?


[09-Sep-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	flipping is a viable option... but has it's limits


[09-Sep-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Things you know.


[09-Sep-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	it gets you used to the products and the actual volume sold. All T1 workers food / T1 buildings materials are good investments with some variations.


[09-Sep-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You can also see the difference between CX. And they are pretty big. Compounded I should say.


[09-Sep-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Now I'm talking about day trading. Not the other kind. Trading from CX to CX when you see a difference in price.


[09-Sep-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	I don't know that yet.... but some day.

**Lexip**:	Oh ok ;)


[13-Sep-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It is basically growing crops from H2O (buy in CX an import here) into a Farmstead FRM then into an INCinerator to get C ;) It's profitable!


[13-Sep-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Maybe you already built all that ? :)

**NorseFTX**:	Oh nice, latest POPR shows that some of the SCI were picked up, so their population ended up increasing slightly. Will continue to maintain the current trajectory (since there are no open jobs, SCI will just slowly grow with the current setup). PIO population also looks like they'll start to balance when unemployment drops by about 2% and Happiness exceeds the inward migration threshold of 70%. May even be able to scale down Planetary Festivities the upcoming week.

[14-Sep-22 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RickG**:	How do you tell if a planet is fertile enough to have farmstead


[14-Sep-22 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	it should tell you


[14-Sep-22 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	it did for me, at least


[14-Sep-22 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	i'm assuming you're also on PROXION, which in that case you're all good, this place is fertile enough


[14-Sep-22 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	I love waiting 5 days 22 hours of ral life time for my rig to produce 40 units of water


[14-Sep-22 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	you'd think they'd start you off with more to keep you busy, but I guess not


[14-Sep-22 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Rigs for water on Proxion cost you money. You need to buy it and ship it in cheaper


[14-Sep-22 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	hm. Well Do I just demolish my rig then, I kinda need the mats


[14-Sep-22 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	yes


[14-Sep-22 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Also use 1 ship slow moving and sell the fuel off the second for coins to buy things to make more production stuff


[14-Sep-22 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	The first 2 weeks of play is very slow pace


[14-Sep-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	so what SHOULD I be doing so that I'm not actively burning my capital, besides selling my excess fuel, bc the tutorial was pretty vauge tbh


[14-Sep-22 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Ya, there are many paths. Decide what ca make you money. Proxion has a 25 percent bonus for Agro stuff so it is more stable income. you can grow and sell, grow and make carbon, grow and make rations. Also LST can be mined for sale and profit here. After you have a small stable income you can branch out to what ever ya want really


[14-Sep-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	If you ask 5 people how to do things though, you will get 8 answers...so do something that fits your amount of play time and interest.


[14-Sep-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	hm. Well ig i'll stick with ratoins for now because I don't think I can afford to rebuild


[14-Sep-22 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Sounds like an ok plan.


[14-Sep-22 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Watch how much fuel you use and don't spend more in fuel value than you can make by traveling.


[14-Sep-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	is protein paste a net profit here


[14-Sep-22 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I don't think so...But I don't make it.  Look over the average prices things are selling at Benten STN CX.


[14-Sep-22 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	If you have a PRO account look for shipments on the local market to pay your fuel costs on trips.


[14-Sep-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	oh no wonder i can't afford anything the nearest commodity exchange trades exclusively in foreign currency


[14-Sep-22 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	CIS?   Benten STN is the closest right


[14-Sep-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	nah the closest is antares I think(?), but it only traides in AIC of which I have jack


[14-Sep-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	Beneten it is


[14-Sep-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Benten is 1 star system away from Proxion. Antares is many away.


[14-Sep-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UwUMacaroniTime**:	ah


[14-Sep-22 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	There is a hugh learning curve in this game. Asking questions here will get suggestions from players on this planet. If you ask in general help they could be from anywhere and in different regions sometime good/costs/ avalability are different.


[14-Sep-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Best of luck. I am away for a while now.


[14-Sep-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Sep-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Game is slow space economy, end game is buildings ships with big cargos / resistance to planet weather conditions and planet maintenance (a player is elected governor of a planet and builds planet buildings to give bonus to all players on it)


[15-Sep-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-22 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	Generally stable population report with very slight SCI growth; all unemployment is still positive so I'll keep the current general trajectory unless things change substantially. I should note that I'm going to bump up the Planetary Festivities level to II for the next run so that SCI can more quickly reach the 10-15% unemployment level as a safety buffer, and will just let it stabilize there.

**NorseFTX**:	Latest POPR shows minor loss of ENG and minor growth in all other workforce tiers; ENG population will stabilize before going under 15% Employment so this should be fine at the current rate. SCI has now grown to the target 10-15% unemployment buffer as well so all workforce tiers are in the target buffer range. Will continue with the current trajectory of maintaining workforce populations while also working towards more efficient POPI upkeep, and will adjust programs or upkeep ratios as necessary if people start utilizing more ENG/SCI.

[29-Sep-22 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	In reality I think some big crop producers have switched from Farms to Hydroponics. Uses less space but more water so over all more production in same base size but higher H2O use. Just a thought from bits of talk I have heard here and there.


[30-Sep-22 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Yes right. That happens right now. We started a pure HYF planet last days, that will take more water from Etherwind. So water could be a problem for others

[30-Sep-22 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Making HYF first and them watch the H2O disappear is not a great planning guys. So NS will go up then LST (also a problem) and N. It should be the other way around, First increase H2O and LST then get your NS going then switch to HYF ? Is it an economy game or what? Or maybe you wait for the "market to adjust" on his own? :p

**Nerva**:	Is it me or does it seem like price charts tend to be 'cut off' at the top somewhat lately?


[04-Oct-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Maybe just prices going down?


[04-Oct-22 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	More like going up but the chart isn't re-centering vertically higher. Or really "zooming out" enough to see the top I guess.


[04-Oct-22 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	For example CXPC BSE.NC1  ... 7 or 30 day. Those prices didn't go above that top part even once? It just looks funny to me. Maybe it's fine I dunno..


[04-Oct-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Maybe they just hit the market maker prices and that's why it seems like a kinda 'flat top'.

**Grandpa_Canuck**:	All CXPC and CXOB look ok on my screen. No change here. Must be something with your graphics.


[04-Oct-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	It could be that too.


[04-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	You are right BSE hit the market marker though so it does look flat on top...but it is


[04-Oct-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I think that's what happened. Ok, just checking :)


[04-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	But them I may need new glasses.  lol


[04-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol


[04-Oct-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Maybe time to get into the BSE business..


[04-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Well Benten CX H2O kind are making people try to be self supplying and, well, a lot of BSEs are needed for that.


[04-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Haha... I guess we all think the same then. I'm fueling that myself a little.


[04-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	We predicted this a month ago on my twitch stream.---higher BSE prices.


[04-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Although I'm thinking of selling H2O also, not just self-supplying.


[04-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Good call


[04-Oct-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I don't make BSEs---but I am a lot more self suppling H2O than I was 2 months ago.


[04-Oct-22 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I get it. Market is responding, just takes some time.


[04-Oct-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Latest POPR just came out :v


[04-Oct-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Similar to prior POPR, minor growth in most sectors except for ENG; ENG should also stabilize before employment drops under the target 15% level. All workforce tiers are within or above the target 10-15% unemployment levels, so the workforce reserve buffer is sufficient; for now, will maintain the current trajectory and will adjust things as needs change.


[04-Oct-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh wow you donated seconds before I was about to fill everything for the CoGC, thanks a ton @Lexip for the donation! ><

**NorseFTX**:	Latest POPR arrived! A good chunk of Scientists have been employed, so the unemployment levels for them dropped enough to start increasing their growth rate. Will aim to have them reach 10-15% unemployment as with the other tiers.

[19-Oct-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sure thing


[19-Oct-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	What specific question do you have?


[19-Oct-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	@HeroikHan Welcome to Proxion ;)


[19-Oct-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Thanks! I was interested in the commodity exchanges. Is there just the 6 of them? Is it possible for players to build more?


[19-Oct-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Also, since I am farming, is there any way to see a planet fertility without building on it?


[19-Oct-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@HeroikHan, there are only 6 in the universe (unlikely to be more)


[19-Oct-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	It just seems odd. Besides the 4 that are central, the other 2 seem practically useless?


[19-Oct-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	There is a fertility bar if a planet has fertility... but most players use https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch?Rocky=true to find suitable planets


[19-Oct-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the 2 outer CXs were part of a contest.


[19-Oct-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You could develop in remote CXs but only with a group of people who coordinate to support each other.


[19-Oct-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok. So using this link, are there only a few planets that have fertility modifiers?


[19-Oct-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Yes pretty rare.


[19-Oct-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	uncoomon would be a better term.. each region has at least 1


[19-Oct-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	uncommon*


[19-Oct-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Don't build RIGs on this planet btw. I don't know if you were told already


[19-Oct-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I was not told that and I have built a rig. Why not?


[19-Oct-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Like terrible water availability?


[19-Oct-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	The H2O extraction is not profitable.


[19-Oct-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It's tough to tell new players since the tutorial is mostly followed


[19-Oct-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, the H2O deposits on Proxion are terrible


[19-Oct-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So the cost of the workers upkeep id making it a problem especially as a new player.


[19-Oct-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	is*


[19-Oct-22 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Interesting. Why did they set it up that way?


[19-Oct-22 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	because the universe has developed since it's start


[19-Oct-22 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are now better sources of H2O that have been developed


[19-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Wait do you mean the water level went down?


[19-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	oooh I see.


[19-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no... just planets with better extraction rates have been settled


[19-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It's more like Proxion being a fertile planet was chosen to be an Agricultural hub but the H2O presence is confusing for newbies.


[19-Oct-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	So import and do agriculture and you are safe as far as your finances.


[19-Oct-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	starter planets can only ever be soo good...otherwise while settle other planets.


[19-Oct-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea. I noticed the rig was kind of not performing and was making a spreadsheet to figure out what to do better.


[19-Oct-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	LST + importing FE can give you a chance to build your own buildings parts for your expansion.


[19-Oct-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are many viable routes to grow. Players just need to decide what they want to get into


[19-Oct-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the community tools section of the wiki is also very helpful


[19-Oct-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You can demolish buildings and resources will be mostly refunded so don't hesitate to try things. FRMs + INC to make Carbon is also another option.


[19-Oct-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	RCO market has been quite nice as well


[19-Oct-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	FRM + Food Processors allows you to make your own water and food too.


[19-Oct-22 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I did set up the rig/farmstead/food processor for drinking water and rations


[19-Oct-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	But you are saying I should take down the rig and import water?


[19-Oct-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Yes, preferably.


[19-Oct-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, H2O off the market is cheaper even if it is 30ish credits/unit


[19-Oct-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok. I did send one of the ships to Benten.


[19-Oct-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can sell 1/2 your starting fuel for extra funds as well


[19-Oct-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok. One more question. What is the upper limit of size I can reach


[19-Oct-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just fly responsibly and conserve fuel early on


[19-Oct-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea, I flew with min fuel/reactor on my first trip


[19-Oct-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	each base has 475 area... and can be expanded to 1k total area with additional permits


[19-Oct-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You have 2 ships, the first trip you should take the fuel from the other ship to sell it to the CX to get you some cash. Then get water and whatever you want (FE maybe to go along with LST to make stuff in a PP1)


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	How many bases?


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	5 on a free account


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	And on the premium?


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	30+ later


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is no hard limit


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	things just get really expensive xD


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	That's cool


[19-Oct-22 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	It becomes exponentially expensive to buy the unlock for the next planet


[19-Oct-22 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Base > Buildings > Demolish that Rig ;)


[19-Oct-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So I can't make a 2nd base right away right? Doesn't make sense to build a rig base somewhere else?


[19-Oct-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	No 2nd base yet no.


[19-Oct-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You can think about having good synergies with multiple planets later tho. Find out about what you want to make and find the right planets one ofter the other.


[19-Oct-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	How quickly do prices fluctuate?


[19-Oct-22 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	We just have a H2O crisis a few weeks back. But nothing major.


[19-Oct-22 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	All beginning items are well traded on the CX.


[19-Oct-22 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Providing buildings parts / consumables / fuel is always profitable if you plan it well.


[19-Oct-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Just keep your upkeep (RAT DW OVE) and watch out your productions and do a CX trip once in a few days to sell and bring back what you need and you should be ok.


[19-Oct-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You can trade on the CX too. Get yourself a "warehouse" at Benten (100/week bery cheap) and it can hold item even if your ship is not present there.


[19-Oct-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok thanks


[19-Oct-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	And demo my rig


[19-Oct-22 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	If it's part way through a cycle, do I get to collect the % that's finished?


[19-Oct-22 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	They will give you your building parts back. And the fee is reimbursed.


[19-Oct-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	it's just 10 CIS or something (a tax) every time you start a new production order. So they give that back too yes.


[19-Oct-22 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You know the fuel trick? Maybe I told some else on the main chat.

[19-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok, got another question. Say theres a planet with no people on it. Can you bring workers?


[19-Oct-22 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Not exactly. The first 200 pioneers will just show up. After that you need to lok at/learn about the POPI reports and other related things. to get them through support infostructure and eventually


[19-Oct-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	There can be planetary projects that enable things like local market or planetary administration center than can affect new workers arriving or leaving


[19-Oct-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	This is a big topic with much to it usually it is involved with planet management by the governor. But a unpolulated planet has to grow into all that.


[19-Oct-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So basically as a new player I should be looking at pre-established planets


[19-Oct-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	It makes it easier by far.


[19-Oct-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	But that is my opinion. Ask 5 people and you will get 8 or more answers I am sure


[19-Oct-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Start here and look at this and related reports. POPR UV-796b & POPI UV-796b


[19-Oct-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	This game is like an onion. Once you understand something you findout there is another level below that of interest.


[19-Oct-22 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yep, I'm just going to focus elsewhere for now. Do you know what "Traded" and "volume" mean in the commodity info?


[19-Oct-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Nevermind. I figured it out

**ihelp**:	on start ships it dosn´t matter how much Cargo


[20-Oct-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	And other ships do? That's kind of weird that starter ships have their own rules isn't it?


[20-Oct-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So I'm looking at the popr, and I find myself wondering where do these people come from? They migrate planet to planet, and move up and down tiers, but is there a growth rate? What are the rules on that?


[20-Oct-22 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Wait really? Only starter ships ignore mass? Is that true?


[20-Oct-22 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I thought all ships ignored it.


[20-Oct-22 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok next question. Where does money come from?


[20-Oct-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	what are you currently producing?


[20-Oct-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	At the start, you're going to want enough consumables and production materials to keep your bases running for 7 days


[20-Oct-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	No no no. I get the concept that I sell to get money.


[20-Oct-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	How does the universe get money.


[20-Oct-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	every 5-6 days you'd send your ship to the CX to restock and sell what you have produced.


[20-Oct-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	All these workers are eating rations which is someones money, how does money get reintroduced?


[20-Oct-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	The universe gets additioanl miney by new players joining and selling products to the Market makers


[20-Oct-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So all the money in the universe is 40,000 * the number of players that have joined?


[20-Oct-22 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Incidentally populations consuming is not a money sink.


[20-Oct-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea, after I said it I realized that the money for the rations still went to another player.


[20-Oct-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are actually very few money sinks in the game


[20-Oct-22 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but that is a good question... thank you for clarifying what you were asking about.


[20-Oct-22 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So basically, if I'm ever above 40,000 I'm a 1%er


[20-Oct-22 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah.. you'll understand once you're on a 2nd base.


[20-Oct-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I know a player that is ~11 days into the game that has made ~250k already


[20-Oct-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I'm just like, conceptually, for me to be above 40k, that means another player has to be below 40k


[20-Oct-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	remember... money is added to the universe whenever someone sells to the Market makers on the CX


[20-Oct-22 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Which I guess some people join, spend all their money, and quit, so that's extra money


[20-Oct-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and players farm MMs


[20-Oct-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok, what is this concept


[20-Oct-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	OH, nevermind, I get it


[20-Oct-22 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	What sets the market makers? They don't adjust lower?


[20-Oct-22 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they haven't been adjusted in a long while... but they are on basic stuff


[20-Oct-22 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	such as RCO, RATs, fuels, etc.


[20-Oct-22 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they'll buy any amount of that item for a set price.... or sell certain items at a set price (they are on both bids and listings)


[20-Oct-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	But just on the critical items? I'm noticing a bunch of items don't have an MM


[20-Oct-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are some fairly advanced MMs on drones and auto-doc that players sell to for quite a bit of profit


[20-Oct-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those are the ones that are pouring in additional credits into the economy


[20-Oct-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Gotcha


[20-Oct-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So I feel like I've screwed myself a bit. I know this game is slow, but I accidentally spent two days sending my ship to benten and back and got the wrong building parts...


[20-Oct-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that isn;t great, but as long as you have enough stuff to keep producing.. you can keep progressing


[20-Oct-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea, well I can definitely keep producing on 1 frm and fp for like a week. I sent my second ship to go sell my extra rations and fuel and hopefully come back with the missing pieces


[20-Oct-22 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Once you've learned more about the game and systems... you may get more value from restarting.


[20-Oct-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	otherwise... learning from mistakes is a great way not to make them again


[20-Oct-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Eh, I thought about restarting but it just doesn't fit into my life story


[20-Oct-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	If one mistake cripples my company than I'm not strong enough to play this game lol


[20-Oct-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some mistakes are more difficult to recover from... but missing a building material is fairly common


[20-Oct-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and easy to recover from


[20-Oct-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	To be fair, I did get the correct building materials for 2 more food processors. But as I was flying back I realized that part of my plan was to also buy the pre-ration food, which I had not done


[20-Oct-22 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So then I was like, no problem, I'll build 1 frm and 1 fp, but I'm one bde short for that


[20-Oct-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	And then I was like, maybe I can just build an extractor in the meantime. 4 MCG short


[20-Oct-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if I could... I'd spot you them xD


[20-Oct-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I tend to buy slightly more than I need to avoid that xD


[20-Oct-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	It's no worry. I've learned. My lesson learned is that you spend a lot of time doing very little, so make the actions count.


[20-Oct-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly


[20-Oct-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm still learning myself...


[20-Oct-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	This game reminds me a lot of eve, but without people trying to blow up my shit. Less pretty though.


[20-Oct-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	am running for governor on a small planet (JS-601c)... and that is going to teach me a lot xD


[20-Oct-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Just need to learn from mistakes and keep on trucking along


[20-Oct-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Is that near here?


[20-Oct-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I have not learned how to navigate the universe map by name


[20-Oct-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's a couple jumps away by the other agriculture world (Nemesis) in this faction's space


[20-Oct-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you need a map... this one is great http://prosperous.freecluster.eu/?i=1


[20-Oct-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	oh thanks


[20-Oct-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	This game has a lot of external resources


[20-Oct-22 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the community loves it so much that they make tools for it


[20-Oct-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Oh yes, there is a sector called XD


[20-Oct-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	That's fantastic


[20-Oct-22 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So are planets player named?


[20-Oct-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Most are player named. Some starter planets in systems are pre-set


[20-Oct-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	But if players colonize a new planet they get to name it?


[20-Oct-22 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they do not. Naming rights go to players that support the game


[20-Oct-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ah ok


[20-Oct-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the game does need to be funded somehow... and the current model is very generous


[20-Oct-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you are planning out your base... PRUNner is another great tool


[20-Oct-22 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea, I've got that


[20-Oct-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Not the easiest tool to use but it works


[20-Oct-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it is much easier than some other ones out there. If you have questions just let me know


[20-Oct-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the lower the PP there.. the better the profits are


[20-Oct-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	What does PP mean?


[20-Oct-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Profit %?


[20-Oct-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	no. that can't be right


[20-Oct-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	price point I believe


[20-Oct-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So here is my big plan from yesterday. I was going to make FIM because the planner said great profit. And I forgot to buy any HER.


[20-Oct-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	But then I was looking at FIM on the market and was concerned about volume


[20-Oct-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FIM doesn;t move that quickly


[20-Oct-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since only engineers consume it


[20-Oct-22 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Right. And then I was like, what if I invest into  making this product and then just have all my money tied up in it


[20-Oct-22 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for new players... that certainly is an issue


[20-Oct-22 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So, I'm moving towards a little bit more self sufficient type style. I'm importing water, making rations+just enough drinking water


[20-Oct-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah PRUNner's great. Has a dark mode now too (I contributed it lol - eyes couldn't take the white)


[20-Oct-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that sounds like the plan many new players have


[20-Oct-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	wait... it has dark mode?


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Now I see it, that is so much better


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yep a few days ago a basic dark mode I did was merged in


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I know my eyes were bleeding from the white UGH


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	oh... I still need to update...


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Couldn't see the theme against all the white


[20-Oct-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I want to keep the custom %s of the old verson though xD


[20-Oct-22 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Custom %s?


[20-Oct-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	https://i.imgur.com/3sbG7RH.jpg

[20-Oct-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Oh I see, interesting


[20-Oct-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the more recent version moved to blocks


[20-Oct-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I've been able to get pretty accurate results by just duplicating what I auto queued up in game


[20-Oct-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I just bump the number on rations up up up until drinking water total is just above 0 XD


[20-Oct-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah.. I'm considering changing over for dark mode.... soo tempting 😘


[20-Oct-22 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Haha


[20-Oct-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Do you like the super high contrast? I kinda do but the repo owner felt it was a bit much.


[20-Oct-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I bear with it on my 2nd screen when needed... otherwise it s minimized


[20-Oct-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	There's a screencap in the thread under Issues


[20-Oct-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It also acts as a back-up when FIO gets testy


[20-Oct-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I mean the dark mode is quite high contrast


[20-Oct-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Wait, why does Katoa say 0 (+18) plots


[20-Oct-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	is that like a waiting list?


[20-Oct-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	+18 is the number of ghost plots above the planet's plot capacity


[20-Oct-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ghost plots?


[20-Oct-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those occur when starting players land a base without enough room


[20-Oct-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Oh. So starting players can always place a base on starter planets?


[20-Oct-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	starter players can start their 1st base even on full planets


[20-Oct-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I wish I knew about that when I first started


[20-Oct-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sure... but that only matter for ~4 planets (Katoa, Montem, Promitor, and Vallis)


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plenty of opportunity without a base on those


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yes but now you're locked out of them forever if you don't have a spot there


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well... I started on Proxion


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	True


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but I nabbed a Katoa plot when there was an opening


[20-Oct-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I think it's just the "locked out forever" lack of freedom that bothers me. lol


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Well maybe you could just pay 19 players serious cash to move away


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I'll get over it.


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Haha


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can just wait like I did


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Did a spot open up eventually?


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Maybe I'll keep an eye on it. Doesn't look good though.


[20-Oct-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	vallis had openings recently as well


[20-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I know quitters get wiped off the face of the universe


[20-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just keep an eye out... nothing major


[20-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Can you pack up your original base?


[20-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can.. but you'll get nothing returned doing so


[20-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since it was made with a kit instead of hard built


[20-Oct-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok. But say I want to free up the base slot for a planet with actual water down the road


[20-Oct-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you already have extra permits


[20-Oct-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea. But I've already got those planned for 14 different minerals.


[20-Oct-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so you can have a 2nd base without upgrading your HQ


[20-Oct-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	good luck with the logistics for all those xD


[20-Oct-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Look. Here's how I'm thinking it


[20-Oct-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	logistics and ship/travel time becomes a huge limiting factors


[20-Oct-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	If everybody can meet at the CX and trade for profit, there's no reason I can't one day have any entirely internal empire that does it all.


[20-Oct-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I'll probably go a little base crazy too, already got the 2nd. Honestly I think the main scaling issue with this game is going to be your time.


[20-Oct-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Etherwind is a good 2nd base option


[20-Oct-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Etherwind is going to be my 2nd


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Optimizing to keep the amount of routine stuff you need to do seems to make sense. Yes my 2nd is at EW


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm skipping over Etherwind....just going to do Nemesis


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Katoa was going to be my 3rd until I realized I'm not allowed. I'm considering a reset but... then I won't be in this chat.


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm in Katoa chat as well xD


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Oh yea!


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but.. Proxion is a great planet


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Right


[20-Oct-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	but I can always come back some day


[20-Oct-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	maybe... depends if it fills up as well


[20-Oct-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Prox is more full than EW


[20-Oct-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just need to weigh your options


[20-Oct-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	ok ok. I'll stay. But I want you to talk to the devs and get at least 5% more water here


[20-Oct-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Proxion is balanced enough.... it's one of the better starters out there (some are more specilized)


[20-Oct-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Man I would hate to be the devs trying to balance this game.


[20-Oct-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they've had practice


[20-Oct-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I bet


[20-Oct-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Ok. Next question. If your first permit gives 500 space, and the next 2 do 250, do you try to have a bunch of 1 permit bases?


[20-Oct-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, all my bases are 1 permit


[20-Oct-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I believe most players have it that way as well


[20-Oct-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	It just seems like the sole reason to go all in on one planet would be if it had insanely high raw materials and you just wanted to pump that


[20-Oct-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it takes a good reason to expand an existing base...


[20-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	or really high fertility


[20-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Something that you can't just plop down anywhere


[20-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	honestly... most players try to extract as few raw resources as they can


[20-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Why's that? Low profit margin?


[20-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	much of the money is processing them into finished or intermediate goods


[20-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah that's what I've read


[20-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I mean... as few extractors/collectors/etc. as possible


[20-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So where do all the cheap raw resources keep coming from?


[20-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Getting the raw stuff is just more fun though. lol


[20-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since each of theose takes room away from more valuable buildings


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Probably idiots like me who still plan to go mine that stuff and sell the extra.


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	And me i guess


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some larger players outsource extraction to other players xD


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I was literally like... if I build an extractor here I can BUY SIO and make MCG and then like WOWZERS


[20-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I know on Montem there is one player just extracting LST and selling it on the LM. That is all they do


[20-Oct-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I like the chemistry symbols so I might be a little biased towards this end of the game...


[20-Oct-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	chemistry.. is quite fun


[20-Oct-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Proxion has a few chemistry synergies as well having LST locally


[20-Oct-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I'm taking advantage of that one now. Especially after realizing how much mass LST has when shipped to CX :P


[20-Oct-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	That is why Etherwind is popular... you get a lot of H2O with very few Rigs


[20-Oct-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	So now today I just became a BSE producer. Those things have been sitting it almost MM prices for a while now.


[20-Oct-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	*sitting at


[20-Oct-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nice! Just need to move FE over here xD


[20-Oct-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	look at the resources on JS-601c


[20-Oct-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(new buffer) PLI JS-601c


[20-Oct-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for the new players


[20-Oct-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Awww yeah... that's some nice iron


[20-Oct-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	indeed


[20-Oct-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Dang. Is that where you are running?


[20-Oct-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	largest amount around Benten w/o INS or TSH


[20-Oct-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Price on the Ben market is low enough that I think I can go without for now. Need to convert all this LST into something lighter. lol


[20-Oct-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm mostly on JS-601c for the HAL


[20-Oct-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	to be honest... need it for chemistry HAL -> CL -> HER -> MED/KOM


[20-Oct-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Oh yeah that looks like a fun one.. what you making a GigaFactory or something


[20-Oct-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Power cells and capacitors... hmm


[20-Oct-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm not that large into any one product


[20-Oct-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	If someone is trading at the same price as the MM, do they still get to sell?


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Because on the order list the MM is lower


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah that's weird. I don't know why the game even allowed that.


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@HeroikHan, which product?


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Or why you would want to do that. Unless you're cheating for free storage


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	BSE


[20-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I've seen it too


[20-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah... the MM gets the sale


[20-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	CXOB BSE.CI1


[20-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	That's what I would have thought. Maybe people just don't know.


[20-Oct-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah they don't have enough there for them to be using it as "storage" so I guess they're just stuck until they cancel


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most of my Pre-fab production is down in Ant


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I dunno if Prox is even a good place for that but oh well


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Uses up all this heavy LST anyway


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Proxion does well enough


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	LST is quite light


[20-Oct-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Prices at Ben are certainly nice enough


[20-Oct-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but I deal in really heavy stuf xD


[20-Oct-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	LST is light? Oh well relative to some other things yeah


[20-Oct-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I guess it's probably middle mass or so


[20-Oct-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Only takes me about a day or two to fill a ship


[20-Oct-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's slightly higher than average


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Uh, how many extractors do you have like 5?


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol No just two for LST


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	And even that probably overkilled it


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	I'll probably downsize it to 1 some time


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I just run 1... does well enough


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Oh, for repairing buildings, it is just a rounded up relative percentage of the original cost right?


[20-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I would agree with that. I like learning the hard way.


[20-Oct-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no.. repair cost is a bit trick to understand


[20-Oct-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are breakpoints where it is better to repair at becuase each building material decays at a different rate


[20-Oct-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the general rule of thumb is to repair after 59 or 89 days


[20-Oct-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	ok.

[20-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah I don't think I'm gonna bother micro managing that. Workers will just have to deal with broken crap all the time.


[20-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	oh god there is a ^


[20-Oct-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at 90 days 1/2 the building's materials have decayed


[20-Oct-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so you can either repair it or demo for 1/2 the resources returned


[20-Oct-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol @ ^


[20-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	ok, but looking at this, it is a linear equation


[20-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Now that equation isn't so bad... it's the () that make my eyes bleed


[20-Oct-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	not the condition but the repair


[20-Oct-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So in theory, on my farmstead that has an LCD of 4, the ideal repair time would be 44 days


[20-Oct-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Assuming I'm keeping it


[20-Oct-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	repairs are linear.. but the efficiency loss of the building quickens as time goes by


[20-Oct-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Right, so ideally, just before the first big breakpoint is when you want to repair


[20-Oct-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ideally... yes...  but most players find that troublesome


[20-Oct-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	"Sir, the roof of the food processor just collapsed. Can we get some repairs sir?"


[20-Oct-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	No, that's your new sunroof


[20-Oct-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sky light... improves moral!


[20-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Yeah see, that's what I told them. They didn't appreciate it AT ALL !


[20-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	They just don't like sharing oxygen with a hole xD


[20-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol


[20-Oct-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the joke is on them... they're payng for it anyways


[20-Oct-22 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Prox has oxygen though, right? Right? Hold on I better check to see if they still live..


[20-Oct-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Well maybe a bit thin but that's fine, it'll help cull the weak.


[20-Oct-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	all of that underlaying stuff for populations (life support, safety, etc.) is usually dealt with by the governor


[20-Oct-22 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so pay your taxes xD


[20-Oct-22 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Ah crap don't tell Norse. Remember I NEVER mistreated my employees. Not even that time when the roof collapsed. Which it didn't.


[20-Oct-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Nothing goes to waste... not even the pioneers that don;t make it


[20-Oct-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	That's right, my donations to the protein bank are always impressive.


[20-Oct-22 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Well.. there is a reason why AMM is required to make stuff in the Fermenters


[20-Oct-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol maybe stay away from the local GIN


[20-Oct-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Especially if it's branded Soylent Green


[20-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when consumables get tight... overalls are eaten after use to save on rations


[20-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	lol


[20-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	of course.. after everyone has worn them first


[20-Oct-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Wait, you feed them?


[20-Oct-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	couldn;t get them to work otherwise... no matter how many I tossed out the airlocks.


[20-Oct-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Ah, I see.


[20-Oct-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Oh wow. Now I see why I could get 200 guys to sign up just like that.


[20-Oct-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	The game picks up once you have a few more buildings producing. Especially if you get into CX trading.


[20-Oct-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I dunno if CX trading is for me. I'm fine to just be a cog in the machine while I play other games.

[20-Oct-22 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Hey the joke's on you HeroikHan, those were all just complainers! :P


[20-Oct-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	That video is super interesting and a great tool. I just don't know if I have that kind of guts


[20-Oct-22 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	All good. Just something to keep in mind.


[20-Oct-22 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it can be as easy as taking STL fuel from Benten to Moria or Ant... it just depends


[20-Oct-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I'm just going to keep baking rations. mmmm


[20-Oct-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	rations sell well around Benten


[20-Oct-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	Cheap to produce too as long as the buyer doesn't ask where the raw materials came from.


[20-Oct-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	One third Nuts


[20-Oct-22 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-22 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	When market info says 30,000 in the traded box, is that per day?


[21-Oct-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Are you refering to the


[21-Oct-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	CXM reports, the right column? If yes you see at the top 1d Units with 7d Units under it. So the top is 1 day traded and the bottom is 7 days traded. If you are refering to the CXPC reports the bars at the bottom refer to traded over the period as chosen from the top right choices. of lengths.


[21-Oct-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	In 20 min moving from Benten STN to Proxion. Over 400tons space open for shipments. Contact me is you need a shipment.


[21-Oct-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Whats the deal with these shipping offers? Can I take advantage on a free account and is there normally a charge that goes with?


[21-Oct-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Need a Pro account to accept them


[21-Oct-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	You need PRO to access the LM


[21-Oct-22 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	yes


[21-Oct-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	if youre new, you dont HAVE TO start producing


[21-Oct-22 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	you can become CX trader that buy in bulk then sell to oter CX, such as Buying bfabs from Moria then sell them in BEN


[21-Oct-22 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea. I have been getting that suggestion a lot. Trust me, that is the fastest route to my bankruptcy


[21-Oct-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	Buy hi sell low, forget to load, go to the wrong planet, forget to fuel!


[21-Oct-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nerva**:	A cheat spreadsheet I guess mitigates the risk a lot.


[21-Oct-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	This helps to compensate for the drop in safety due to the recently decreased number of bases on Proxion as well

[11-Feb-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	If it's a short enough time after you constructed it, you can scrap a building for full materials back


[11-Feb-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Or if you want to keep those, but have the EXT as well, you can buy BSE at the nearest CX, Benten Station, and fly out to pick it up

[11-Feb-23 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	You'll need a HB1 (in case you scrapped those as well before) to house the Pioneers, and you'll also need consumables for them (DW, RAT, etc), which might be in your ship inventory? Been a long time since I started so not sure where they might be.


[11-Feb-23 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	if you have the 'BS UV-796b' buffer up, you can check on the 'workforce' and the 'buildings' that you have all those

**NorseFTX**:	Looks like a number of Scientists were employed! I'll bump up the Planetary Festivities level up to level II for a round, since SCI Unemployment is getting close to the target 10% unemployment lower bound, just to ensure a buffer of Scientists are available if any need them. The rest of the population is within comfortable range however so I don't think I'll need to keep it at level II for very long; as usual will keep an eye and adjust as needed.

**NorseFTX**:	Latest POPR update - As with last week, workforce tiers are all in the 10-15% unemployment buffer zone, so I'll continue with Planetary Festivities I. Will keep an eye on PIO levels and swap to level II if required.

**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Start is slow. Pick a direction to develop and slowly work at it. Develop the plan and keep your eyes open for possible profit selling/buying. Don't travel too much or too fast. WORK YOUR PLAN. No two players play/plan or put the same amount of time into the game. When you ask advice you will get get too many answers and all are right and wrong. Follow your plan and your style, there is no golden rule for profit or right or wrong.

**Gilith**:	complete some of the ones that don't require the rating


[31-Mar-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	or complete some faction contracts, I believe they also count for the rating. just be careful, some (most?) of the faction contracts may be unprofitable


[31-Mar-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stanslav_M**:	And how many contracts need to be completed in order for the rating to rise by one division?


[31-Mar-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it won't jump by one "division" - assuming you fulfill all the contracts, it'll jump straight to A


[31-Mar-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NorseFTX**:	Latest POPR for Proxion is up! Will keep the program at Planetary Festivities I for a cycle longer since we're still well over the unemployment buffer (looks like unemployment for PIO actually went up, so some people utilizing PIOs may have reduced their usage recently). Will keep watch and adjust as needed!

**NorseFTX**:	Latest Proxion POPR is up! I actually ended up not setting a governmental program last week (woops), although since we were well over the 10-15% buffer for many of the workforce tiers it was fine (and we still are over). Since they all dropped on the order of 3-6%, we might be able to go another week without a governmental program so that we don't have too much unemployed workforce. Will keep an eye and adjust as needed.

**xensored**:	Yes same here, I manage only 5 bases mainly for ship parts and electronics. All the rest I have a dedicated ship which repeat the same route and visit one time per week. some bases I visit only once a month to fill consumables and pickup. Works nice if you have a buffer of 30-60days for consumalbles and inputs. But depends on  the products, for C or metals you'll have to visit a lot more often. This can be improved by using a dedicated ship and severals STO, but a little more effort is always needed for the heavy weight products

[03-May-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Statement**:	I'm having a talk with them, trying to figure stuff out.


[03-May-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Statement**:	Alright, so the other corp and I aren't a fit. So yeah, what does a corp do except being cool? There's the 10% efficiency bonus. Some banter/teamwork I guess. I don't know if there is something you wish someone took care of and vice versa. Perhaps that is even this site owner place, I am fairly new to the game. Played a little in the past but for some reason it says I registered a few days ago. Maybe I expired.


[03-May-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Statement**:	Anyway, I thought I'd branch into foods and drinks. Didn't occur to me that I might be doing other things once I built a food base. No idea how deep the rabbit hole goes with tiers and difficulty. Perhaps there is someone around here who might accept us, or we could try to do something on our own. But I haven't got very far.

[05-May-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	When are the population report generated ?


[05-May-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	It's weekly starting with the day the planet was first settled. For Proxion the next report is 7 days from 2d 16h ago.


[05-May-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	So, I've revised the population report, and I can see that the unemployment for pioneers is 12.7%, or about 23K free pioneers.  Does that mean that I'll have no problem when the population rebalances at the end of the period ?


[06-May-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-May-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is quite a learning curve dealing with logistics, the commodity exchanges, and base building


[07-May-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not all faction contracts are worth doing... as flying ships burn fuel and take damage


[07-May-23 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Statement**:	Yeah I noticed that some of my contracts offer me less cash than just selling straight to market. Though I did them anyway out of faith that faction rep somehow might be valuable.


[07-May-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	faction points increase the value of faction contracts... so I'll get around to them if they don't take ships too far out of their way

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm curious as to what are the stats on limestone extraction on this planet.  I'm unable to calculate the time and yield based on the information I have.

[22-May-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	if you hover over the settings icon 2 lines will appear just click the way you want to divide it by


[22-May-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	yes, drag by the blue bar. other option is to click the gear icon in the buffer - you'll see the full command, which you can then copy-paste into the "enter content command" prompt


[22-May-23 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it may not be the most intuitive UI, but you'll get used to it, and it's highly customizable

**NorseFTX**:	Latest Proxion POPR is up! Workforce tiers are still stable and in the safe zone despite no program being run last week, so we might not need to run a program this week either. Will check next week again and recalibrate if needed.

[25-May-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	this is pretty great planet for farming and mining LST


[25-May-23 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Naragor**:	Thx!


[25-May-23 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Naragor**:	Yes i was planning to mine soon. But farming too? That's good news !


[25-May-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Farmland is decently rare, but mining LST and selling it locally is a solid option to - Though you do need PRO for that. Else you need to haul it to CX next system over.


[25-May-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Naragor**:	So, to start making some CIS, I can sell LST without PRO at CX?


[25-May-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Naragor**:	If, i've understood correctly, thx for the tips (i'm not english sry)


[25-May-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	hi welcome


[25-May-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	@Naragor, yes without PRO or Basic licience you will need to move goods to CX and sell it there


[25-May-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Naragor**:	Thx for the info !

**Rubick**:	what is this race to the bottom in carbon prices at the exchange? We need to form a cartel and fix a minimum selling price.


[30-May-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Not sure what you're on about, the prices are the highest they've ever been.


[30-May-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	C used to be ~400


[30-May-23 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	maybe not the highest since C was at 600 not long time age, but 500+ is still high


[30-May-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Oh right, forgot the chart line shows the average - there's actually been some buys up at 650 / u at times, jeebus


[30-May-23 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Even Hortus that enjoyed a long trend of 300-350 / u has crept on high


[30-May-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	hey... have you guys been able to calculate at what point you have a reminder that supplies are low in one of your bases ?


[30-May-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	i have my Base Inventory as my Main Display Screen


[30-May-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Not sure I understand how it relates to my question.  I receive notifications once a day that supply are low. I want to know what the threshold is so I can keep ahead of it.


[30-May-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	The standard in-game warning is no more than 24 hours I think


[30-May-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	You can deactivate that under NOTIG


[30-May-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	no clue, I'm pretty sure I got those notifications even with ~30d supplies. maybe there are several thresholds, I don't know, I've been ignoring those notifications ever since


[30-May-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, least I have right now is 2.27 days' worth


[30-May-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	thanks for the answers


[30-May-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I just know it seems to pop up whenever 1 material that's in use for any prod or consumed by workforce hits sub 24 levels


[30-May-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Like, it just warned me that my Libertas base is running out of stuff this morning and only had low LST at site


[30-May-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	oh i miss read it lol


[30-May-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	so it's not just for consumables, but for production materials too... that would make sense. I maintain good stock of consumables, while with production mats - it depends; often it's easier to switch production instead

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Under the warehouse dialog of the planet info (command WAR UV-796b) it allows me to contribute to different expansion. If I understand correctly it will allow me to upgrade my base storage from 1500 to greater ?  Same thing with my ships or my rented warehouse ?

[01-Jun-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@Yeyland-Wutani, warehouse are seperate storage spaces on the planet but not connected to a base


[01-Jun-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	anyone can rent a warehouse on the planet and upgrading that infrastructure allows players to rent multiple warehouse units.


[01-Jun-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	However... upgrading warehouse infrastructure is usually the governors job with tax funds. Since the upgrade benefits everyone on the planet (not just an individual player)


[01-Jun-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at the moment... players can rent 5 warehouses ea. on proxion... I doubt @ Yeyland-Wutani, needs more warehouse units than that

[01-Jun-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	no shipping costs, instant delivery


[01-Jun-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	A lot of LM ads are also corp-priced for internal trade


[01-Jun-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jun-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jun-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	@Kassfloris thanks for the heads up! I started as a Carbon farmer actually so I got an incinerator. I was doing the math on PRUNner yesterday to see if it was worth making my own DW and realized the investment isn't worth it.


[02-Jun-23 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	I realized this too late... three rigs already


[02-Jun-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Not here... much cheaper to get from Etherwind than to run the rigs and processing to make DW yourself here.


[02-Jun-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Oh, wasn't a question; I see now :)


[02-Jun-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	Does liquidating my rigs give me all my mats back? like it it worth it to liquidate them or should I keep them running


[02-Jun-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	Yeah I was going to build a rig to see how much water they produced but then I found PRUNner lol. 2 water every 7 hours isn't worth it.


[02-Jun-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	It tells you how many materials yo uget back from liquidating.


[02-Jun-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	The Buildings screen will tell you how many fabs you get back when you demolish


[02-Jun-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If it's within a short amount of time (hour or so?) you get everything back


[02-Jun-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	Oh thats good to know


[02-Jun-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	So no harm from hitting the wrong button if you catch it right away :)


[02-Jun-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Instead of Etherwind.. I'll truck-in H2O from Nemesis.


[02-Jun-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	There are multiple options... I just wanted more agricultureal space then Etherwind initially provides


[02-Jun-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	Is there a reason someones buying GRN for 500 CIS at the CX? Seems like a lot lol


[02-Jun-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that was my GRN... and it was a lot


[02-Jun-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	lol


[02-Jun-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	see.. when there is little supply... and someone REALLY needs it... they'll pay anyprice for it


[02-Jun-23 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just something to consider


[02-Jun-23 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	lets try for 700/u this time!


[02-Jun-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Either someone really needs it... or they'll soon show up as liquidated


[02-Jun-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I mean.. it was The Gravy Company... they have the funds


[02-Jun-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	Ahh gotcha, I was just wondering if I should switch all my farms to GRN lol


[02-Jun-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	maybe.. you'd likelyt get 300/u consistently till supply increases


[02-Jun-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just depends on what other players do


[02-Jun-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I don't typically sell much GRN or agriculture products


[02-Jun-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lardhunter**:	I've been turning it into Carbon but if I can get that much just for GRN I might have to consider it lol

[02-Jun-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@TheFirst, hmm 10 days in... 2 planets... you're well connected xD


[02-Jun-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@TheFirst, yes and no... once the "most profitable" thing is identified.. it quickly gets ground into dust


[02-Jun-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	then... it is no longer the "most profitable" anymore and something else is


[02-Jun-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	@RNGzero haha im trying my best... networking is key


[02-Jun-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	so... pick something youy enjoy making XD


[02-Jun-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I do HMSs.. ~12% of the universe's supply...


[02-Jun-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	err... 16% which is ~100/day


[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	different regions have different things going on.. so select well.. or make plans for long transport chains


[02-Jun-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	rich man @RNGzero


[02-Jun-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	HMSs are overpriced atm because of the shock a couple weeks back


[02-Jun-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	niceee


[02-Jun-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	2 players bought out a weeks supply from me.. and the other guy doing 12% around Benten didn;t send any to market


[02-Jun-23 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	how long would it normally take someone to get 2 bases>


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	?*


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	45-60 days

**TheFirst**:	got it


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	and nice luck


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	depends on a lot of factors


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	what are the top factors?


[02-Jun-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	usually starting profession, CX to CX trading, and networking


[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	"the best" starting profession depends on the markets at the time


[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	well im hacking the networking aspect lol


[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	its been a massive help


[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	ahh


[02-Jun-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	I mean mine is pretty mediocre lol


[02-Jun-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	got it for free tho so ill take it... the planet was a conditional


[02-Jun-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some planets stand alone better than others... while others need synergies between bases to get the most from them


[02-Jun-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	ah fair


[02-Jun-23 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	that will be my next base then


[02-Jun-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	wait why would I want to build on Harmonia??


[02-Jun-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	I thought you were talking abt a planet that supplied AMM lol


[02-Jun-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	read you wrong


[02-Jun-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	oh, nah.. most players don;t need AMM


[02-Jun-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	harmonia is Ant's breadbasket


[02-Jun-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you may end up leaving proxion to settle Harmonia quicker.. or build a separate chain/standalone

**RNGzero**:	quite a few players get "concerned" about disclosing their base/products... but the markets are large enough


[02-Jun-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hope those answer some questions you may have


[02-Jun-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFirst**:	@RNGzero yes that's very helpful thank you!


[02-Jun-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Thanks for that Screenshot


[02-Jun-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	as I take it, the queue length is based on the number of buildings you have ?


[02-Jun-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	because here everything is 5


[02-Jun-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for each building you'll have 1 production slot... but queue slots are tied to HQ level


[02-Jun-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	eventually you'll want to upgrade your HQ (after the 2nd or 3rd base)... or opt for larger batches


[02-Jun-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	my setup wouldn't work for everyone sence I ship-in a number of items (H2O, DDT, etc.) from other bases

[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you gotta build more pioneer habitats :P


[08-Jun-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	security is a concept that relates to a planet's total population.  It is the domain of the planet governor.


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	If you want more people in your base, you'll have to build more production lines to employ them, and more habitats to lodge them.


[08-Jun-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Markuz**:	Ok, good to now, thanks for help


[08-Jun-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	know that your lodgable population will be split between all production lines. If you have 220 pioneers required but only 200 pioneers, every production will function at 10% less speed

**jelutz77**:	Happiness is the basis of growth of your particular tier of population. If the population is over 70%, that population will grow. Each tier has their individual requirements, in addition to the requirements for happiness of the prior tier.


[08-Jun-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	For example, ENG require comfort, as well as health and safety and life support from lower tiers to be happy. Iirc, the happiness is capped at the highest level of service provided.

**Kaasfloris**:	what about hydroponic farms at etherwind? You don't have to ship all that water, it is resource extraction (no idea why it doesn't count as agriculture) and you can move chemicals in


[12-Jun-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	HYF would work on Etherwind, though most choose to max out Etherwind with other things


[12-Jun-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it's resource extraction to maximize the H2O extraction; that's what that planet is best for. switching EW to agri doesn't make much sense


[12-Jun-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	HYFs on EW are still viable. and if you care about efficiency, then build them here on Prox


[12-Jun-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	H2O isn't very hard to ship, so most ship it to a neighboring planet to make RAT if they want to do that. I do that with Norwick.

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I have a contract with a liquidated company for with I sent the termination request.  Will it disappear by itself or do I need to do something else ?

[12-Jun-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	You could think about to join on KW-020d and import H2O from EW, that's what I do.


[12-Jun-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**User_Not_Found**:	As a Food grower, is there any way I can make my food growing process faster/more interactive? Even making my stuff in the smallest batches possible isn't more than once every day and a half


[13-Jun-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	? even without bonuses, most FRM recipes take 12h or less, with a few exceptions. check your production line efficiency - maybe you don't have enough HB1s for your workers? or you're missing some supplies?


[13-Jun-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	also, COF and PWO helps. providing PWO is almost always worth it. COF - well, it depends on the prices


[13-Jun-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hagamablabla**:	The game will be a little slow at the start, but once you get big enough to have multiple bases, things start getting more complex. The game will always be mostly an idle game though

[28-Jun-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	just curious, did you develop any of your bases with extra permit? I mean over 500 area?


[28-Jun-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DasRallum**:	only 2 of my bases


[28-Jun-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I've done it, but normally it ends up being until I figure out how to divide among 2 bases


[28-Jun-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	caus I have my Proxi on max and EW about to go to second permit, but this is just a start and I may develop more wisely in future, for now I want to get max possible from each base


[28-Jun-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it's not a bad choice at the start, you can increase production without straining your logistics; after a while when HQ upgrades become more expensive, you'll want to avoid that. but I still have 3 bases on 2 permits

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm not sure I understand.  Using a permit to extend a base uses the same thing as building a secondary base ?


[28-Jun-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I think they meant adding the permits into an existing base, the one that increases available area by 250


[28-Jun-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah... does that have the same effect as building another base ?


[28-Jun-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In terms of available area to build things, expanding existing bases only give 250 area vs 475 area in a new base (after excluding 25 area for the CM)


[28-Jun-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i meant in terms of permits


[28-Jun-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Both takes up 1 permit


[28-Jun-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh, i see


[28-Jun-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	but it's more logistically efficient to have things in one base


[28-Jun-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, clearly


[28-Jun-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	so it's whether the trade off is worth it to you


[28-Jun-23 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	As do stations


[10-Jul-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Is this something that changes over weeks then? Or can it be as fast as a good time of day


[10-Jul-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	So the devs attempted to make the system as realistic as possible.  Flight times will vary over weeks, not within a day.  But how fast a planet orbits depends on its distance from the star.  So different systems will end up with different change rates


[10-Jul-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	If you join the discords and scroll back in the right section, you will see stuff by people who have reverse engineered the mechanics.  PiBoy in thr PCT discord would be my first go to for details on that.


[10-Jul-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea I don't know if I need to know the specifics, I was just intrigued because going one direction was like 23 hours and going back was 17 or something like that


[10-Jul-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	There is also variability driven by planetary gravity and the weight of your ship.  It is a pretty complicated system.


[10-Jul-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Like technically flying with a half tank of fuel should in turn cost less fuel than flying with a full tank

**adnc555**:	What does it mean for a contract to be closed? I accepted and started moving to fulfill but after some time I get new ones in and it appearrs that I can no longer fulfill anything


[18-Jul-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	ahh nvm there's an faq


[18-Jul-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	;)


[18-Jul-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	basically the contract you're closing on is the one you accepted.


[18-Jul-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	You'll be periodically offered 3 different


[18-Jul-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	as you gain rep, you'll have more lucrative contract


[18-Jul-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Calculate your stuff correctly, because sometimes some of them are not worth it


[18-Jul-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	also make sure to know where the delivery is for...


[18-Jul-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the payment will always be made to your HQ planet


[18-Jul-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	thanks - haha I'm just eyeballing everything atm, I know.. very bad, but for now this is fun


[18-Jul-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, it's a lot of information overload at the start


[18-Jul-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	That's actually one thing I haven't got the hang of yet, I can't find a way to tell where a planet is on the big map so I can't actually tell right now whehter those survey contracts are feasable - I'm sure there's a way just haven't found it


[18-Jul-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	under the 'start', you have a system map


[18-Jul-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	use the system code to find it


[18-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	You can also input the planet coordinates in your flight control to check how much it would cost in fuel


[18-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	remember you have to fly back :P


[18-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	ahh this might be why I'm struggling, I nuked the start scrreen accidentally so I can't recall what was on that screen


[18-Jul-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	universe map is the commande MU NAV


[18-Jul-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	Ah yeah I did read that about "testing" a flight in the faq, that's probably more useful/accurate to gauge things isn't it.. thanks for reminding :)


[18-Jul-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	I recommend this map: http://www.prosperous.freecluster.eu/?i=2


[18-Jul-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Jason32835**:	So I bought a bunch of Nitrogen and a few days ago and it has disapeared from my inventory. Any reason that would happen?


[21-Jul-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Check CONT


[21-Jul-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you might not have enough warehouse space, assuming that was bought from the CX


[21-Jul-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jason32835**:	Bought it from Antares Station. I see the exchange order but no longer in inventory.


[21-Jul-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Check CONT


[21-Jul-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jason32835**:	Ah, shows as pending.


[21-Jul-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yep this means there wasn't enough inventory space on the station


[21-Jul-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jason32835**:	Request termination?


[21-Jul-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	just 'fulfill' when you have the space on station (warehouse or ship)


[21-Jul-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jason32835**:	I foolishly flew to Hortus to sell it. New guy


[21-Jul-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Well... This makes sure you check before flying off in future ;)


[21-Jul-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jason32835**:	Go back and get it.. got it.


[21-Jul-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@HeroikHan, where at?


[28-Jul-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	fk-794b :(


[28-Jul-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I posted an ad for fuel that hopefully someone will fill and I can crawl back to hortus


[28-Jul-23 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Just bad planning. I saw an $8000 trip and didn't think about the fuel


[28-Jul-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ah, boucher... should be plenty of ppl there


[28-Jul-23 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ask on global chat since you cannot ask in bouncher planet chat


[28-Jul-23 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could also ask if someone has stuff you could ship to Hortus CX from boucher


[28-Jul-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	thanks for the tips


[28-Jul-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	trying to make lemonade out of the situation xD


[28-Jul-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I took your ad @Hero


[28-Jul-23 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Thanks for the assist


[28-Jul-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I could have gone out to save my own ship but then I would have had to leave my home base for like a week without shipments


[28-Jul-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So since I have some people around, I delivered a shipment to boucher, and I have hit fulfill. Status says 'fullfillment attempted' but I still have the package


[28-Jul-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	message the player and tell them


[28-Jul-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Is this a situation where they don't have capacity to receive it?


[28-Jul-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I did


[28-Jul-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it means they don;t have enough space in their inventory


[28-Jul-23 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I rented a warehouse there and left the package and messaged them that there is a package they need to sign for


[28-Jul-23 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hopefully the warehouse cost isn't 2k/week xD


[28-Jul-23 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	no it's 0


[28-Jul-23 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	which is why I did it


[28-Jul-23 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	oh good... I know some planets have so high fees xD


[28-Jul-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea. Even if it was like 100 I wouldn't mind. If it was 2k that would be a no-go


[28-Jul-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	But the issue is that their warehouse is full right?


[28-Jul-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes


[28-Jul-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can attempt to fulfill again once they massage you back about enough space


[28-Jul-23 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	So what ultimately happens if it times out?


[28-Jul-23 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I get to keep my uber rating because I flagged it as attempted right?


[28-Jul-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Also is it possible to make a payment to somebody directly?


[28-Jul-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	no payment to someone directlry.  You can however sell one ration for really high

**Inforiel**:	Ship access depends a lot on corps in general, you also need active PRO to make use of more than 2 ships - but in general it's of interest to upgrade your starter ships to accomodate your main proffesion


[02-Aug-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you run heavy stuff like metals, WCB's are great. If you run lots of small goods, might be worth saving for the more costly LCB or start out with MCB

[02-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	for starter ship upgrade, WCB or MCB are the only reasonable options; if you need LCB, build a new one


[02-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	well, it's not the best planet for producing fuel. Katoa is much better. this is an agricultural planet


[02-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyler.cawthon**:	oh ok


[02-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	you could either restart, or stay here and just switch to farming


[02-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyler.cawthon**:	how do i switch


[02-Aug-23 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	open a new buffer and type: MAT RAT to see the recipes for rations. select one and start producing it - you'll need FRMs to grow crops, FPs to turn them into rations


[02-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	not sure if your start package has the correct types of prefabs to build all you need, if not then you'll have to buy them


[02-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	most people use GRN + BEA + NUT recipe


[02-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyler.cawthon**:	ok


[02-Aug-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	pro tip: buy water, you could extract it here but it's very inefficient

[02-Aug-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hagamablabla**:	Also, good to see that I picked the right RAT recipe. Guess I did my math right


[02-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Oops, I'm referring to AI1 prices... maybe the same at CI1?


[02-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Yeah, Proxion H2O sucks


[02-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I use primarily AGL VEG MAI recipe :)


[02-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	*ALG VEG MAI


[02-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	yes, but that requires HYFs, which new player can't afford - not without loan anyway


[02-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	HYF needs 16 MHL, they're pretty expensive


[02-Aug-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	@Yeyland-Wutani maybe it wasn't wrong - I didn't do the math, I don't produce RATs


[02-Aug-23 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	all the recipes are viable, and e.g MAI is more useful if you're also making C


[02-Aug-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Yeah, all the recipes have a niche


[02-Aug-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh, okay :P   because i had calculated that BEA+VEG+GRN was more efficient timewise


[02-Aug-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Most people calculate for cost efficiency


[02-Aug-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

**HeroikHan**:	What kind of garbage contract system makes me an F rating because somebody else didn't have room to receive the order


[02-Aug-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I sent the guy multiple messages asking him to make space, to extend the contract etc. He didn't do any of that in time so the contract failed and now I have an F rating :(


[02-Aug-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	On the flip side, I am now the proud owner of approx 279,000 ICA worth of nutrient solution


[02-Aug-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	The negative value you get is very heavily reduced since you had "Fullfillment attempted" again and again


[02-Aug-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	yea but F? Is that not as low as it can go?


[02-Aug-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	When I was in the contract menu it said they had to extend it


[02-Aug-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Hmm, had they paid as well?


[02-Aug-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	yep


[02-Aug-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Honestly, I would have 0 issue still finishing the contract except I had no option to extend it. It wasn't costing me anything to store it.


[02-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	lol, yeah, well, if they are non-responsive you could give Discord a go


[02-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	they did respond once, near the end of the timer saying they freed up room


[02-Aug-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	but by the time I got back on again, it was past due


[02-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	and said they had to extend it for me to deliver it, which is so messed up


[02-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Ah, well, can poke them again to try and settle the deal - Should square your rating up as well


[02-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	How can that fix my rating though?


[02-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And avoid getting reported on the UFO discord for piracy which is always a bummer


[02-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	You get negative points for breaching and positive ones for fullfillin


[02-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	So fullfilling should net you back up - System just got an overhaul though


[02-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea but is one contract really going to erase the breach?


[02-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	So can't say for sure


[02-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It used to be very, very easy to get an A-rating but they switched it all up in last patch a week ago


[02-Aug-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Yea well I figured that because literally I got an A rating after my first delivery


[02-Aug-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	The system is designed so that you're not dinged if they didn't have space for the order. If it affected your rating, it's a bug.

**MinoRoss**:	Would you guys recommend Pro?


[03-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I played 2 weeks before giving it a try myself


[03-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	There is more things you can do with PRO active, letting you grow faster, so it's not bad - But there's no harm in taking your time to feel out if the game is for you first


[03-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	So just goof around a bit and if i like task manager simulator i can buy Pro


[03-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	Thanks for the awnser


[03-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	The main benefits for a starting company is being able to do business outside of CX


[03-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Later on there's the benefits of more bases, being able to build and fly more ships, but those are not really relevent until you're making millions :)


[03-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	So it's hard to condense into a yes or no


[03-Aug-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	Ok so buildup is managable with free and mid game you should start thinking about it


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Yeah, comes down to your own thinking - I wanted to max profits so I have been running PRO non-stop for almost a year now after those 2 first weeks


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	Oh nice


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	I started the game a couple of times but never really catched on


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	But now i want to try it again


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MinoRoss**:	i failed ahrd at this start


[03-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Well, you'd have better luck getting more answers and input from the Global chat


[03-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And tips in general


[03-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	its not on by default


[03-Aug-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	I guess so. It's highly inconvenient. I wouldn't take the contract if I knew ahead of time I was going to be waiting indefinitely.


[03-Aug-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	yea I wish it's on by default, also it would be nice to have auto provision option on sale ad


[03-Aug-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Like, I don't care if it's on or off. I want to be able to SEE before I commit to it. Like why can't I see the conditions before accepting? It's crazy.

[17-Aug-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	I did try to have a peek at other lines than what I went with but there are no details where there could be, like when you look a rig up you can't see what resources it extracts. I suppose that's planet dependent so I get why but it could be done. or is and I haven't found it yet

**adnc555**:	is it just me or has h2o extraction time increased recently? or have I only just noticed that it takes 5hr. I'm sure it was 4 something not long ago


[24-Aug-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	check the condition of your RIGs


[24-Aug-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	production line condition 100%


[24-Aug-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	well, no idea then - unless you've shuffled your experts


[24-Aug-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	lowest is 98.9%. That estimate is on a recurring task just for info


[24-Aug-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	I added an expert so it dropped... maybe I'm just not remembering, or I checked an alreay in progress job back then.. shrug


[24-Aug-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	I don't have rigs on Proxion so can't compare it


[24-Aug-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	dunno what it's like on planets with more water


[24-Aug-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	prob way better


[24-Aug-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	you've probably heard that before - but rigs on Proxion are not worth it... if you can, demolish them and import H2O from Etherwind


[24-Aug-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**adnc555**:	not worth it as in -ve, or just too small +ve?


[24-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	one RIG at Prox can get you up to 10 H2O / day; only in theory, with 5 extraction experts, but lets go with that. one RIG at EW can get you 67 H2O / day


[24-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	so one EW rig can replace at least 7 Prox rigs, freeing your fertile land for more farms


[24-Aug-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	that's napkin math with 5 experts on EW and rigs in perfect condition assumed, but should be convincing enough


[24-Aug-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Aug-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	prices vary by region - LST currently goes for 75 at Benten CX, so if you want to sell yours, you'll have to list it at similiar price. but it goes for 225 in Antares CX. is the difference worth the costs of fuel and keeping your ship busy? that's for you to decide


[25-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it's probably not worth it for 40 LST - but for a shipload of limestone?


[25-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HeroikHan**:	Dude how is limestone SO different?


[25-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Aug-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Mac-Flar**:	@spacewolf Proxion has low density of water so you need way more rigs to produce enough water to supply a HYF. bying water at a good price and ship it to proxion is a good way an later opening a base at etherwind


[26-Aug-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	or other planets with high water density Nemesis is another good planet

**I_am_Tex**:	Sorry - missed that question back to me yesterday, but Mac-Flar gave the same answer I would have given.  Water supply here is pretty low, trying to supply water for HYFs locally means you'll have a mostly water base supporting a small number of HYFs.

**I_am_Tex**:	Given your EFIO tag, I assume you have a base on Etherwind ... produce your water there and have just pure HYFs here.   (Or if you don't have a base on Etherwind, get a WAR there and buy water on the LM to bring to Proxion)


[27-Aug-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Menthim**:	Hi, I'm a new player. Am I mistaken? It seems like I'm better off buying my water on the market than producing it myself?

**jelutz77**:	Yeah, once you have enough RIG to make your own supply for whatever (FRM, DW) on this planet, might as well buy a CM and move them to Etherwind.

[05-Sep-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sonicus83**:	"just HCP" is about the same time for 4 HCP -> 4 C as 1 FRM makes 12 HCP, so that would be 3 INC per FRM


[05-Sep-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sonicus83**:	if you take the "faster" recipies like 4 HCP 2 MAI 2 GRN... Excel (or any other spreadsheet tool) is your friend ;)

**TheAnvils2**:	why does the Incinerator take so long to process carbon like I can't even play the game for days because I have nothing to sell


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	The game is intentionally slow paced.  Especially at the beginning.  As your company grows, you have more production lines and thus more production finishing in shorter time periods.


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	This is a very slow game, initially you'll have very little actions avaliable but it will slowly fill up


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you reach my size, a few days of being inactive will cause your logistics to crumble and millions of losses :) I'm experiencing that right now


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	But at the start I only visited every 3 days or so


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Many people spend the time between production runs trading on the market.   If you purchased a pro license, you can also do some shipping to help earn extra funds (to build more production to make the game go faster).


[30-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	More than a world - a _system_.  Bastion a has LST and TIO (and SIO) and runs resource extraction.


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Bastion b runs metalurgy... and Bastion d is the best ice world in the game and runs resource extraction... so lots of water there.


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Bastion c... looks like its being settled to be an agri world of HYF bases with NS made almost entirely in system and lots of water just one planet out.


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the amusing things... this world is a bit dry.  I need to import water otherwise I'm running lots of rigs... so, do I ship it all the way from Frost? or do I LM buy it local?


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For some context, H2O.NC1 and H2O.CI1


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and if I buy it local, do I buy _more_ and ship *that* back to Moria?


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	nearly no one pumps here.  Most big operations ship it in from Etherwind, just south of here


[13-Oct-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A full load of water (2500) shipped from Benten (@28) to Moria (@35) would net you 17k credits.


[13-Oct-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(not that I _want_ people to do that... having bases on Verdant and Frost I quite like selling my water close to 40 on the LMs.)

[13-Oct-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's not _too_ far to Moria (btw, do people accept NCC down this way? or is it CIS only?) but that means that I need fuller loads to make it worth it to ship either way...


[13-Oct-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Proxion is mostly CIS


[13-Oct-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it's one jump over from Benten


[13-Oct-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	there's some other offers, but i don't feel like they're popular


[13-Oct-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Interested in bringing back some stuff from Moria here ?


[13-Oct-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the things about the Circe - Moria - Midway - Verdant route - there's a lot of activity but they're not one hop away from each other - more spread out.  Which means that it takes more logistics... but that also means there's more often LM ads that are profitable.


[13-Oct-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sure - When I do a Moria - here - Moria run, I'll mention it a few days in advance.


[13-Oct-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of my ships does Frost - Midway - Verdant and back - I've got enough from Frost and Verdant to Midway always to keep that ship full...


[13-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	and then my other ship does the adhoc runs where I take stuff from Midway to Moria to elsewhere (and introduce repair and expand goods back into the V-Mc-F route to get delivered.


[13-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I just posted the ad on Moria's LM


[13-Oct-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it'll last 5 days, and another 7 days allowed for delivery


[13-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll pick it up and bring it... soon.


[13-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Long duration shipping contracts are _really good_ for shippers and I encourage people to do 'em.  It gives haulers a better ability to plan routes and lower overall costs.


[13-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(side bit, given etherwind, hauling water here seems... a tad bit silly... the phrase is "like bringing coal to New Castle"


[13-Oct-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	no idea what that phrase is, but yeah, most people use Etherwind as a space-pump


[13-Oct-23 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	New Castle in England was a coal was mined... so taking coal to New Castle would be less than optimal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coals_to_Newcastle
Coals to Newcastle
Selling, carrying, bringing, or taking coal(s) to Newcastle is an idiom of British origin describing a pointless action. It refers to the fact that, historically, the economy of Newcastle upon Tyne in north-eastern England was heavily dependent on the distribution and sale of coal and therefore any attempt to sell coal to Newcastle would be fool...

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and my stuff too i guess? :P


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  Your stuff is right there - shipments first, then bfabs, then whatever else I can fit that might sell better in Benten.


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(if I'm not doing a benten leg, its back to Moria and then bfabs and supplies to circe)


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh yeah


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	looking forward to it


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I had stuff I needed to move from Moria to the V-Mc-F logistics loop... and then Midway was filling up with outbound for Frost, and Frost filled up 500m3 of C... its on the way from Frost to Moria now to sell it.


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	if you need stuff moved from Proxion to Benten Station I could do it for you, it's on my way


[16-Oct-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll see - gonna work at figuring out what I need to move this evening for development and CX arbitrage.

**shagie**:	Not sure how much you watch Moria prices, but DW.NC1 looks like the start of a renormalization of the price there.  Not sure how much other exchanges will follow.


[16-Oct-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Plenty of space left on my ship towards Benten Station, then Gibson, Giedi Prime, Etherwind!  Anyone has some shipping to do ?

**SpaceWolf_**:	is it good for farmsteads?


[23-Oct-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	no, HYF production


[23-Oct-23 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	for FRM is Nemesis JS-299a


[23-Oct-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	After Nemesis, its Pyrgos ( PLI CH-771a ) ... which isn't that close.


[23-Oct-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch?Fertile=true&Rocky=true&LowGrav=true&LowPres=true&LowTemp=true -- sort by distance to Benten


[23-Oct-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Are there any Low Grav/Pres/Temp fertile planets?  I didn't think those existed...


[23-Oct-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	TIL Chu is Low Pressure and fertile.


[23-Oct-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I still think it would be neat to make a hanging gardens planet on a triple green gas giant with all HYFs)


[23-Oct-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Call'em Babylon I, Babylon II and Babylon III


[23-Oct-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Oct-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"Another thing I did, and that we will also test pretty soon, was adding around 60 new FTL connections to the map for "under-connected" stars, especially in the outer regions of the universe. This is a first small step in the greater context of map and expansion changes we want to make based on the feedback we collected in the forums recently."

[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Thank you both!! Greatly appreciated :)


[26-Oct-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	xD Oh that would suck


[26-Oct-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On QQ-033A you need both.


[26-Oct-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Almost as bad as having to have HSE lol


[26-Oct-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I keep thinking about getting into HSE production... there are enough planets that seem to be interesting... and will be as there's more outward development.


[26-Oct-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I will once I get an AL planet going. For now I'm just sticking to bfabs


[26-Oct-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I left my metallurgy base at 750 so I had some room to expand into L and H fabs later


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you looked at OZ-189 for chem?  One more hop from there is OF-375 which has Berthier and Adalina.


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I have not. I'm kinda just chillin where I'm at. I was happy with my base selection until a couple days ago when I decided to start SOI production xDD


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Once I get into AL I will be adding some bases around the Ant area though


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Berthier is an AL world running metallurgy (3 green with some N in the air too).  Adalina is 2 green (low pressure) with a ton of FEO running construction.


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nice that's not bad. I will probably stay at JS-601c for awhile though. Assuming I keep running uncontested, I'll be taking over as governor there next week


[26-Oct-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	OZ-189a has HAL and LST and FEO in abundance (running resource -- high temp) and OZ-189c is a low pressure world running chem.


[26-Oct-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Half way between Moria and Hortus.


[26-Oct-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I plan to stay around Ben/Ant for the unforeseeable future


[26-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm mostly northern and moving west and north west... with a dalliance here.  Well, more than a dalliance... but that's my side of the map that I've been scoping out.


[26-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nice, looks like a good spot so good luck :)


[26-Oct-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Bastion is gonna be the interesting place to be.


[26-Oct-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(WB - north of Midway)... every planet in that system other than the gas world is getting developed (SIO, water, HYFs) and then one more jump and you've got an electronics planet being built up.


[26-Oct-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	POPR XG-751b is an interesting pop report.


[26-Oct-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Weird... a material that makes FE that's not FEO xD Actually never seen that


[26-Oct-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... so have you been tempted by Pyrgos yet?  (CH-771a) - further out along the unfactioned arm?


[26-Oct-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I don't have any reason to go there?


[26-Oct-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	High fertility world with abundant water.  Drop a lot of OVE on it and some building materials, ship out HCP or RCO in bulk from time to time?


[26-Oct-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I don't have any plans to go that route. Only need I have for water is the base I setup on Etherwind for my own personal DW collection

[07-Nov-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got questions, ask.  The nature of the game is rather asynchronous (you don't need to pay attention to it for many hours) and so you might not get an answer right away (also ask on Discord if you need a sooner than later response).


[09-Nov-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Giving them PWO to eat is just about always a no-brainer; it's a lot of benefit for the cost. COF should be around 500, which I think it is right now, but is usually worth it unless it's around 1k or something.

**wilfredo967**:	how do i buy stuff i flew to a commidty place


[10-Nov-23 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(This chat is a bit slower than the Apex Global or Apex Help channel)


[10-Nov-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At the CX, you can bring up CX CI1 in a buffer (or click on CXL left hand side and click on Benten exchange) which has the everything you can buy lists.


[10-Nov-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can then select which category you're interested in, and place a trade.


[10-Nov-23 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The Bid price is the highest price someone wants to buy it at, and the Ask price is the lowest price someone wants to sell it at.


[10-Nov-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So for example, if you were to buy Water at Benten, its H2O.CI1 (that's a shortcut to get there) and then you'd put in a buy order for however many you want at 24.90 CIS.


[10-Nov-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If your ship is there, it will be delivered to the ship.  If you have a warehouse, it will be in the warehouse.  If you have neither, it will be held in a delivery contract that you can fufill whnever you have something there (shows up in CONTS - or click CONT on the left hand side)

**Dan_Gyros**:	pioneers atm


[10-Nov-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	apologies, I have found the screen with that information


[10-Nov-23 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	100 Pioneers need 4 DW, 4 RAT, 0.5 OVE, 0.5 COF, and 0.2 PWO per day to be fully satisfied

[10-Nov-23 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-23 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's really helpful as you play the game and plan things.  It also does neat things like show the exact time the ship is going to arrive (not 6h 7 min from now but rather 02:42 AM ... yea, I'm not gonna be awake for an immediate redispatch of that one)


[10-Nov-23 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can also get the information at https://fio.fnar.net/burn?Tickers=BEA+DDT+DW+GRN+H2O+HER+OVE+RAT+VEG (if you have FIO installed.. that's the burn chart I'm concerned about)

**BlueHeeler**:	You will have a pending contract. Your stuff will be waiting where you bought it and you can fulfill the contract when you get there. Turn on SDBR or click CONT to see the contracts. I don't know how to do that on a phone or tablet, sorry.


[11-Nov-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The trick for setting up phone interface is to resize or spoof the desktop window so it becomes a phone web interface, and then you can set things up with the keyboard (and see what workflows you want) rather than discovering them when you're on the phone.


[11-Nov-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks for the advice but I only use a desktop for PrUn, thus I don't know how to use phone and tablet.

[14-Nov-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, the global chat or the global help channels have a larger audiance - this channel is only for the people who have a base on Proxion and while there are a number of us, there are a lot more in the global channels.


[14-Nov-23 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's also the discord at https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz which can be easier to share screen shots.

**gamazebrat**:	*shagie


[14-Nov-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, yea, it is a difficult interface to understand at first.  It's modeled after the bloomberg terminal.  The challenge the game has is there is SO MUCH data that is useful and going for a utilitarian customizable design makes it challenging to start but once you get the hang of it it is _so_ flexable.


[14-Nov-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The game is also one you don't have to pay attention to much - so it can sometimes take a bit for someone to respond (which is also why the discord is a good option)

[14-Nov-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Contracts, and by extension local markets, allow for unrestricted wealth transfer between players.  Being able to create new accounts or COLIQ means that there's an endless supply of new starter money and that would disrupt the economy if it didn't have some checks.

[16-Nov-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's Verdant's secret.  It has such an active LM in part because you can be confident that if you put up a reasonable LM ad (buying, selling, or shipping) it will get accepted in a few days.


[16-Nov-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	That one is... kind of absurd.  Things that are more than about 10% off of what the CX ask or bid (as appropriate) are eyebrow rasing.


[16-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	It's just one ad right now, so it doesn't really clutter the LM.  But when there are 15 ads like that (which there were in the past)....I just completely stopped checking the LM on Proxion.


[16-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If I may ask, do you consider my DDT offers reasonable? or too high?


[16-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Extremely reasonable for delivered product.  10% over for delivered products, 10% under for "at location of production" (e.g. Limestone on Prox) feel about right to me.


[16-Nov-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Another bit is the shipping (that helps with getting the LM active).  I've got about 300m3 (so far) of stuff to move to Midway... just waiting for things to get to nice numbers to ship (its easier to do a 500m3 load than it is to do a 296m3 load)

[18-Nov-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is the planet chat - it tends to be a bit quietier than the global chat and global help chats... though it sometimes gets some activity.


[18-Nov-23 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's limited to only people who have a base on Proxion.

**shagie**:	How do you mean? Population infrastructure?


[19-Nov-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can pull up any building under POPI UV-796b abd contribute to building it or upgrading it.

**ChaoticAnalyst**:	Tho migration isn't that much of a problem is it?


[19-Nov-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	@ChaoticAnalyst Feel free to mention if you'd like to build a certain structure. Right now we basically have been keeping a balance for what's required to maintain the current population (without driving too much education upwards since a good number of companies on Proxion still need Pioneers). There are some buildings we haven't built yet but the upkeep items give much less bang for buck compared to the others so we haven't bothered building them yet.


[19-Nov-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	For now I've basically been doing mostly Warehouse upgrades since everyone benefits from that, and our POPRs are mostly balanced with a decent amount of unemployed workers in all workforce tiers for people to use them as needed (so 10-15% unemployment; if it's too high then workforce starts leaving)


[19-Nov-23 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also a little bit later since I've been busy but CoGC upkeep for Proxion is filled!

[24-Nov-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yoplait73**:	???


[25-Nov-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	CAF.CI1 is made in a HYF.


[25-Nov-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can find the recipie doing MAT CAF


[25-Nov-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	sorry i forgot im using pmmg


[25-Nov-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that CAF has some rather thin margins and unless you've got a large supply of H2O that you can get at cost (say a base on Etherwind), you'll likely lose money with it.


[25-Nov-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	To run a HYF making CAF, you'll need 88 H2O.CI1 each day for it.

[25-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The supply / demand shows that its edging back up to more supply than demand in the book.


[25-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	i wonder if there was an influx of new players near the beginning of the month


[25-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Possibly.  It will be hard for it to go above 29.50 CIS, and you can see that the size of the orders below 29.50 are "small".


[25-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	oh yeah, I was watchin it when it was dipping below the 32 mark, and I wasnt concerned till that 10k order at 28 or whatever came in


[25-Nov-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The difference in price between MCG.NC1 MCG.CI1 and MCG.AI1 isn't enough yet to do meaningful market arbitrage.


[25-Nov-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The style of the price chart suggest "dumping" (selling goods at the lowest value rather than waiting)


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But, you could take 1299 MCG at 25 CIS and sell it for 27 AIC... but that's only a profit of 2600 credits on that arbitrage.


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	cant say as I blame em as im doin the same thing as a new player


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	i wish we could take loans


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and as I said that, the 25 CIS line has been cleared and the lowest price is 26.90 which means "nope, can't do it)


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can take loans - but you need a pro account.


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	ahhhhhh


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Loans are a form of contract and allow for unrestricted wealth transfers.


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Without something to make sure you don't have 100 friends create 100 accounts and sell you all their stuff for 1 CIS...


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	oh yeah i can already see how a few emails and some time would be a bit of an issue


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	smart of the devs honestly


[25-Nov-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The fraud vs engagement debate occasionally shows up on discord.


[25-Nov-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(often in the #Steam Reviews channel as that's where people leave a bad review and discord discusses it)


[25-Nov-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	although it would be interesting if there was a global bank, where u take the loan from the game, and if you cant make payments it takes things from your inventory and sells them to pay back the default


[25-Nov-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dan_Gyros**:	ayoo this is on steam?


[25-Nov-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll be buying (and selling) things at the commodity exchange (aka CX)


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The closest one here is Benten (also known as CI1)


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, this channel is for Proxion base owners - and while we're a helpful bunch the global channels for "Apex global chat" and "Apex help channel" have more activity and you can get a more prompt repose.


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Though even then, this is a slow game and people aren't always watching chat.


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gusgvnm**:	thanks :)


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So... to answer your question... send a ship to Benten with the stuff you want to sell in its cargo hold.


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gusgvnm**:	yep thanks for the help the game is just quite confusing to just jump into


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The game has a _lot_ to it.  And the UI is... utilitarian.  Part of that is because its so hard to make one UI do _everything_ that needs to be done.


[27-Nov-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So instead its "build your own UI out of panels that each do things that you want them to do"

**bitbucket**:	Iiiinteresting. The map changes put Pyrgos about as twice as close to Verdant as it used to be if you go by the new route. Definitely putting the next base there once I save up enough capital to buy the prefabs.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The Pygros cluster is becoming much more interesting with the new link.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	CH-131e has a large AMM tap.  CH-115e has HE and HE3 CH-115a has GAL and LST and is 3 green (a fuel depot?)


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	And then there's decent hydrogen a few jumps further out in RY-780f or AM-371f.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There is a _lot_ of interesting development opportunites in the CH-RY-SO sectors.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	AM-371a also has GAL and AMM but the AMM concentrations are...less than good.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	where have you seen the new routes ?


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	FW-344 - CH-364 is the most impactful.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	just saw the post on the main chat


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Now Verdant and the YI sector industries are half the distance the were before to CH.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And likewise, Proxion growing out to Pygros rather than along the core world's loop becomes intresting too.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	CH-657b for chem? CH-657d for resource extraction (for HAL)? Or other way around?


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I don't have access to that channel on Discord... what server is it part of ?


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Prun Community tools - #General - https://discord.gg/ZT9VJDt


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	thanks Shagie, your help is always appreciated


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll probably put my next base out in Pygros... and then the following one whever the resource extraction is in neigbouring system associated with resource extraction.


[29-Nov-23 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	The region's going to need a lot of bootstrapping—Pyrgos has the only CoGC in any of the surrounding sectors—but now that it's not quite so far out at the end of nowhere maybe we'll see more development out there. All I see in the area is a handful of forlorn bases.


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  That's always a challenge with outside area bases.  The first thing is get the consumables down.


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then I look at resource extraction somewhere in CH-657 and chem on another one.


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Resource extraction gives you a place to put INC that can make over production of agri on Pygros useful... and get C for FEO -> FE without importing it.


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That will also get into a bit more comfortable making BMP from C and CHP products


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	*not* needing to import C from a distance makes SMEs easier to work with... which in turn makes construction something that doesn't need to come from afar.


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	sounds like youve thought about this in depth


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**toktik**:	(looking at the benten CX prices)


[08-Dec-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HCP.CI1 vs C.CI1


[08-Dec-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**toktik**:	4 HCP takes 10 hrs, 4 Carbon takes 1d 6 hours


[08-Dec-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**toktik**:	so the daily revenue from both is around 1900


[08-Dec-23 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**toktik**:	but you spend extra DW and RAT while producing carbon


[08-Dec-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That assumes that you're "selling" the HCP to yourself at market prices.


[08-Dec-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That also depends on the planet you're on (cost of deprecation) and number of experts.


[08-Dec-23 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For me, with HCP from Verdant to Frost to C, it increases from a "my cost" of about 40 to the ~650 that I sell it for.  Selling it at bid price, and I'd crash CI to the 88 in a week (only 479 units of HCP have been traded in CI1 in the last 7 days - I produce 100 / day, the total demand on HCP.CI1 order book is 1518 units.


[08-Dec-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And that's me on Frost (which has 2x higher building degradation costs vs Etherwind).  Regular HCP -> C is 1d 12m.  Three ingredient is 4h 42m, and oddly has a lower cost of good manufacturing than the one ingredient because of building degradation.  Prun Planner says that I make 6k / day on that working off a cost of GRN at 40 (because I'm selling it to myself at cost)

[14-Dec-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You will need to get PRO license in order to get the P rating. You can then work your way up to A after that by taking on contracts.

[14-Dec-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The 5th expert is at 915.10 days, and brings 28.40%.  But if you've got 10x farms running, that's gonna be done in under 91.5 real days.

**shagie**:	One early build of Proxion that I did I saved money by not having COF or POW here when I was trying to rig up... and that's when I realized how bad water is.


[19-Dec-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Getting a 10% bonus to getting 2 water / cycle for COF _loses_ money again.


[19-Dec-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One rig on Proxion "makes" 6.92 CIS profit per day (6.67 H2O and removing expenses).  Adding COF to that gets you to 7.70 water per day and -35.97 CIS per day profit.


[19-Dec-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RockCarcass3087**:	I see, thank you.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Money saved on water is spent on fuel used importing it from somewhere else. With rigs so ineffective here the space is just better put to use with other buildings, and more building space is something money can't buy.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	That proxion rig profit math is so sad... 6


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	6.92 cis per day


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	I'm running a fairly large water surplus on Verdant for...reasons, one of which is to send some here, so I run about 200-300 H2O down here whenever I get under 150 units


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For me, its Frost - I've got a 715 H2O surplus per day there.  Over here, a lot of people look at Etherwind for a water pump world.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(Sand only consumes 375 of that 715 water per day... so there's some surplus there...)


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For my current base load out, Proxion only consumes ~30 per day.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, if anyone is interested, there's a 500m3 set of contracts for Proxion to Sand.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	My plan is to expand to etherwind eventually. I really wanna get into cof producing because i thibk it would be cool to be a redbull esquw company but it seems like the returns on those are pretty diminishing just for use eh?


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COF is interesting... the HYFs have always been the hurdle for me.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	KOM is also kind of interesting - especially if you've got a food processer world.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	In this neck of the woods, Milliways (KW-020c) is the go to.  Move the FPs from here and spin up a FER.


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	Milliways? You can move buildings?


[19-Dec-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can tear them down, collect the mats, buy the missing ones (repair cost is deducted from teardown value) and build it on another world.


[19-Dec-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, I've got a FP here (just one - making my own rats to eat).  Its been up for 68 days.  To repair it it would cost 1 BSE, 1 BBH, 1 BDE, and 16 MCG.


[19-Dec-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If I were to tear it down, I get 2 BSE, 2 BBH, 2 BDE, 32 MCG.


[19-Dec-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Building a new FP takes 3 BSE, 3 BBH, 3 BDE, and 48 MCG.


[19-Dec-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(reclaim + repair) = new


[19-Dec-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Millways is 16h away (at low fuel use).  2 jumps.  156 STL and 32 FTL in a starter (as I write this).


[19-Dec-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's one jump beyond Benten.  You could do Proxion (load up agri), jump jump, Drop off agri on Millways, pick up surplus food, jump, sell at Benten, jump, back home.


[19-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	So then what am i using prox for? Farming?


[19-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch?Fertile=true&Rocky=true -- sort by fertility.


[19-Dec-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you get down to 3% or 0% they're just "ok".  Negative ones are just poor to bad.


[19-Dec-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's only about 10 good ones (depending on how you count).


[19-Dec-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion is the 6th best... and the 3rd if you toss out Saladin and Pygros which are technically better... but a bit distant.


[19-Dec-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	then there are the HYP dedicated worlds like Bastablon-D


[19-Dec-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	sitting right next to Milliways


[19-Dec-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm partial to Bastion c... but then that's my neck of the woods up there.


[19-Dec-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	hehe, fair enough


[19-Dec-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Sand looks like a decent place. absolutely no pressure


[19-Dec-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	good population size so congratz on that


[19-Dec-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You get into the SEA is cheap while INS can get costly, but repairs with INS are easier to do than HSE or TSH.


[19-Dec-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	for sure


[19-Dec-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	Callisto without the Jupiter.


[19-Dec-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	but remember, HYF worlds can get H2O/NS very hungry


[19-Dec-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dokolacz**:	HYF's pros/cons is you can stack lot more then FRM's and suddenly, before you realize, you consume more then 2k H2O/day, so go and play with PRUNplanner :D


[19-Dec-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	very true, I bring a lot of H2O up from Etherwind


[19-Dec-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	the setup costs are quite high, the convenience to Milliways is what I like, but then I am bias.


[19-Dec-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	between Milliways and the HYF's I consume more H2O thank I make and my Etherwind site is almost  maxed out at 500. can always open up another 500 space though


[19-Dec-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Don't forget repairs and the 16x MHL.CI1 build costs.


[19-Dec-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(want to build 20x HYFs?  You've bought out all the MHL in Benten... have fun with repairs in 90 days)


[19-Dec-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I actually have been supplying a lot of MHL to folk on site below cx for that purpose, but you are correct it is not a cheap veture to set up

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	@flasker also, if you want to be a constructor, you can always liquidate the current company and restart on gibson, it's a planet specialized in construction. It's a popular starting spot.  However, it's one jump further away from Benten station.

[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The LST is being sold at a unit price of 32.79 each,.


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	yoplait, send you a contract


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Not quite what you're asking for but will help


[20-Dec-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	@Yeyland-Wutani I actually did start as a constructor but i was informed by a few people it wasnt good for a new player start


[20-Dec-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	i actually was on gibson


[20-Dec-23 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	im thinking now of mining LST here on Prox, and SIO on Etherwind and producing MCG on etherwind so i may still get into it


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Well, show it to us now :P


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	is the LST or the SIO easiest to haul ?


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	LST is 1 m3 -- 2.73 t;  SIO is 1 m3 -- 1.79 t


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	so SIO is easier to haul :P


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got 500/500, SIO is easier.  If you've got WCB, they're the same.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(for WCB, if the ratio is less than 3t / m3, then m3 is the constraint rather than tonnage)


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	so ur saying i should produce the mcg here on proxion? I'd be going between prox etherwind pretty constantly for water anyway


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A BMP on Proxion is... big and is construction rather than agri.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	yeah id rather have it on etherwind


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gibson would be the best place if you're after a BMP.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	would it not be cheaper to do my water extraction, and sio extraction as the same place as bmp? or is this a fools errand?


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Your BMP will run 25% faster on Gibson and you'll be able to do 5 resource experts on Etherwind and 5 construction Experts on Gibson.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Ummm,


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	BMP is manufacturing.  Katoa is the COGC target


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I stand corrected... I haven't ventured into the metal / manufacturing / construction industries... yet.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	so in the long run that's wworth the shipping and everything?


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Shipping becomes an incidental operational cost as you realize effecicines.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	got it


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, I make more money spending ~3000 NCC per day to ship my agri from Verdant to Sand than I'd make trying to do FP on Verdant.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	okay swell that makes sense


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(that's just ballpark since I generate 300t export surplus per day there and work off the 10 NCC / ton - though sometimes I haul it myself)


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Likewise, I needed more agri... and so I moved all my HER production here... and its cheaper for me to do lots of farms with HER and pay 15 / t to ship it to Sand than it is to try to make FIM and KOM here.


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(need to send a ship with COF and DDT down here in the next week... hmm...)


[20-Dec-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The main thing though - working with the 25% boost from CoGC is a big boost.  Being able to put 5 experts on one industry is HUGE.

[24-Dec-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	That FIO feature is the best way to look for those, but my advice is that you look at the exchange for the commodities it highlights before you actually make your purchases.


[24-Dec-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I use FIO to find them, then dig in to the order books to verify them.


[24-Dec-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Sometimes the bid is an outlier bid and makes FIO show something as better than it really is.


[24-Dec-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Yup.  Just want to be sure they dig into the order book and verify.


[24-Dec-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	DDT.CI1 -> 4x HER.CI1 that's about a 3x increase of value.


[25-Dec-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HER.CI1 -> 2x FIM.CI1 (that's another 2x increase in value)


[25-Dec-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Or HER.CI1 -> 6x KOM.CI1 ... if you've got the facilities, that's a 3x increase in value.


[25-Dec-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Going from DDT to FIM or KOM, you're looking about a 12x increase in the value of the original investment in DDT.

**flasker**:	next run ill have to pick some up i just didnt have enough bread to buy my buildings and a good supply of DDT but i looked and HER.CI1 and FIM.CI1 and you're for sure right about that being the way to make money


[25-Dec-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At the moment, only got 3 days down here... but I make DDT over in Circe, ship it down here, make HER here, and then ship that back up to Sand where I use it to make FIM and KOM.


[25-Dec-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Some of my early substantial profits came from the FIM route - you can do all that with settlers.  KOM needs a Fermenter, which isn't too bad.

**shagie**:	Give me a couple days... got 36 heading to Moria for some inventory juggle, and then a total of 168 heading down here.  I'll have to check out how much surplus I have for a bit before I post it.  That's probably a week before I get that settled.

**shagie**:	On Proxion... buy water, don't rig it.  C sells well, but a bit of RAT can help stabilize your operations.  Expand to Etherwind when you've got the revenue / resources - you'll stop buying water and that's a better place for INCs.

**flasker**:	should i be concerned if im getting agriculture experts rather than food production experts


[27-Dec-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	you will get experts only for factories you are using. i.e. something you are doing IS Agriculture.


[27-Dec-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	but dont worry you can get experts in multiple indistries


[27-Dec-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	so if YOU HAVE FOOD PRODUCTION ON THE SAME PLANET YOU WILL ALSO GEET A FOOD PRODUCTION EXPERT AT SOMEPOINT


[27-Dec-23 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	sorry for caps


[27-Dec-23 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Dec-23 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	i just was wondering if ag experts are better or worse than food prod experts if i wanna make food


[27-Dec-23 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	yeaaaaa... typing. a skill I still havent mastered


[27-Dec-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	i thought it was hilarious


[27-Dec-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	all experts are good in their industry. you can have you to 5 assigned to 1 industry an a total of 6 assigned on a single planet


[27-Dec-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	okay gotcha


[27-Dec-23 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	each additional expert has a logarithmic increasing effect on the inductry .


[27-Dec-23 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	1 - 3.06, 2 - 6.96, 3-12.48,4-19.74,5-28.4


[27-Dec-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	add a COGC bonus of 25% and things move allong quite nicely


[27-Dec-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	right and ive been made aware the COGC is multiplicative with the experts bonus so ag experts here on proxion where the cogc is agriculture its good to have them


[27-Dec-23 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	got it :)


[27-Dec-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	all those little percentages really help


[27-Dec-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	yeah ive played enough idle games to know its a battle of getting little percentage bonuses


[27-Dec-23 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	its a balance between efficiency maximizing and logistics


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My farms are curently running at 167%.  I don't have a corp HQ here and don't have my HQ over in IC space... that would be the way to get it higher.


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	167% is pretty darn good... Nuts (a nice "can only make it one way" thing and long enough to be interesting) takes 21h 31m for me


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At least... over in Verdant, that's my %.  Realzing that this is Proxion chat rather... I'm currently at 155% here.


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant has slightly better soil fertility and I'm only at 120% for agri experts rather than 128%.


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**yoplait73**:	Which RAT recipe is the best? Or is there a best?


[06-Jan-24 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've done BEA / NUT / GRN for a while because it is low water and with the right choices for BEA and GRN, all three take exactly the same length of time allowing for my first spreadsheets to work out better.

**shagie**:	However, VEG rather than NUT can go faster... and that means that you can produce more... if you've got the FPs to handle it.  But it takes more water.

**yoplait73**:	thanks


[06-Jan-24 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yoplait73**:	i've been using BEA/NUT/MAI


[06-Jan-24 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	MAI rather than GRN... its a 12 batch, at 1 water for 3 MAI.  Runs slightly faster than the 3x (1 H2O -> 4 GRN) production, but slower than the (4 H2O -> 4 GRN) ... I wouldn't say its a bad choice here.

[07-Jan-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Dang if I knew nobody would pick it up by now I’d have sent a ship with some on it 😅


[07-Jan-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I’ll send a ship here in a minute and if nobody fills by morning I’ll send a contr for cheaper than the cx


[07-Jan-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LacisumUtama**:	yea usually when im missing something i get like 4 contracts for it by now :D , although i just created my base on Proxion and goofed the maths on initial setup... got the core mod, and housing. aint got the production :D


[07-Jan-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	lol Ya usually people have it buy now but I suppose that is a lot of BSE for an average player


[07-Jan-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh crap I don't have a ship in Ben at the moment..


[07-Jan-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LacisumUtama**:	probably, i dropped a few bases the past few days. not sure my masterplans of developing 4-5 bases at once were the brightest but alas.


[07-Jan-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You wanna chance it and take a shipping ad from the cx to prox? Then I'll send another contract once you deliver if you still need it


[07-Jan-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Basically you get paid to ship them and cheap BSE if you still need them xD


[07-Jan-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll pay 5k to ship from cx => Prox and I'll sell 17 for 14k CIS (823.5ea)


[07-Jan-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Just to help out as a welcome to prox present lol


[07-Jan-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LacisumUtama**:	uhh let me find where my ships went to, think i returned to umbra instead of the CX, im on my bed monitor which is tiny and not helpful so moving to desk


[07-Jan-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	lol gotcha. Ya just lemme know. I'll be on another 15 or so min. If not I'll get a ship back to the cx by morning and probably be at prox in about 22ish hours


[07-Jan-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
***AriesNation** deleted this message.*


[07-Jan-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LacisumUtama**:	sure, ill have a ship there in 3.5 hours


[07-Jan-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Ok I'll go ahead and send contract now so I can get it provisioned before I go to bed


[07-Jan-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll go ahead and send you a contract to buy as well. I wouldn't accept until you return with the shipment just in case someone else has some available first. But if you do accept I'll be up and on in about 8-10ish hours and I'll fulfill


[07-Jan-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LacisumUtama**:	rgr that


[07-Jan-24 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	How do you deconstuct a base?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Entire base is: cancel every order (and queued item), go to buildings, and demolish each building with the CM last"


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	However, the corresponding question of "why?" comes up - because there might be something easier... depending on what you're trying to do.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	I wanted to move my starting base, but don't have the materials for it


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
***AmirOn30FPS** joined.*


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	but I think I'll need to make another base and make it HQ, first anyways, so I guess I'll just wait until I can afford another base


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	The Material must be in your ships, unload them


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Where did you want to move your starting base to?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	PLI LS-014a it's got a lot of sandstone


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(there are some starts that you can only start on if you _start_ start there...)


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	*limestone


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're going to need a lot of INS there too.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	INS?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Insulation - its a cold world.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	INS.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	to even put down the CM (command module) you're going to need 250 of that.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	oh, so maybe I should make it my second base...


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That would be a better choice.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(my first expansion was to Frost and the "oh, INS... oh, LOTS of INS" was a bit of a sticker shock to me at first)


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Another consideration is that they're running electronics COGC there... which means that you won't be getting as much LST.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	no idea what LST is


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	hold on my first production order says "completion/duration : in 6 days"


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Limestone.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	do I actually have to come back in 5 days?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion is the 5th best planet for LST.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	that's what I'm on right now


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	should I stay there?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	@AmirOn30FPS, according to the steam reviews, I believe that is indead the case


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  (well, in the 3 green category - there are better planets if you're willing to have other building materials)


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Amir - what are you making that's going to take 5 days?


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You're probably missing something - a basic consumable... or you set the production count high...


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	water, 40 uunits


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Water on Proxion... this is a dry world.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You get about 8 / day... so yea.  5 days.


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	im on hol on


[08-Jan-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**AmirOn30FPS**:	thanks


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	how do I ungrey out my production tab?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll get better water by buying it at Benten and shipping it here.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"ungrey out production tab"?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	where can I buy BDE?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	the production tab is grey, not yellow, I can't click on it


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm still not exactly sure what you're looking at.  Screen shots (especially on Discord) might be helpful. https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	Oh, I had no basic materials plant, that's why it didn't let me


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	bruh wait why does 1 unit of MCG take 6 hours to make??/


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	wait no thats order size 1, but its 50 units


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - one run of MCG in the BMP makes 50 units.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hagamablabla**:	This game is half idle game. You put in an order, then come back tomorrow


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	damn, I hoped for this to be more active, seemed more interesting on the Steam page


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It gets better as you expand.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The first bit of "make something, wait, sell it, repeat" takes a bit.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	oh


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	hol on cant I just spend all my LST and SIO to make 250 MCG?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	I might aswell come back tomorrow anyways


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But once you have the revenue to support doing more things, you do more things... and things are happening with greater frequency.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can.  It will take longer... but you can.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	what can I do with MCG?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's no fiancial advantage to doing it that way, but it can make planning easier.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can sell it at MCG.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It is also the foundation for building... well... anything on a rocky world.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	oh its value is rising?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's a wild ride there... pull up CXPC MCG.CI1 in a buffer and look at the 30d chart.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Or click on that link and mouse over the gray on gray "related commands" at the top (just above the price) for CXPC


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	the weekly chart says its value is dropping insanely tho


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You will probably be better off queuing up batches so that when you next log on, you'll still have it running in the queue, but will also have some.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	I mean I have 2 BMP's anyways


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	how can I see demand?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The order book.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	where's that?


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	CXOB MCG.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	CXOB BSE


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You need the exchange as part of that command.  Benten is CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	CXOB BSE.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Lower left corner of the screen, there's a "NEW BFR" button.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	CXOB BBH.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Click that, and enter in that command into the text field of the new buffer.


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	ah okay


[08-Jan-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you mouse over the gear in a buffer, you can also access the ':' which allows you to edit / change an existing buffer.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	ah yeah that's how I accedantally broke my planet info panel earlier lol


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Learning / figuring out how to do panel splits can make for some really useful screens.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AmirOn30FPS**:	or wth equity is


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The interface is based on the Bloomberg Terminal.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its my "import export" screen.  Base on the left.  Stuff I want to export goes to the warehouse.  The "how much do I need to ship in" is part of the burn column (added with PMMG).  And then I've got ships and the Moria warehouse on the right.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	nice


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	in this game fixed assets is the value of your buildings, current Assets are your inventorys, liquid assets is what you have cash and equity is fixed + current + liquid assets


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	but the ingame finance screen has its flaws


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	my first order is 4% done! :D


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the things to do is ensure that you've got enough queued up so that when you log on tommorow, everyone is still working and you've got stuff that you can sell.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Sandmuel**:	neat, I think I'll be working on some layouts for my screens


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Every day, every 100 PIO (one BMP's worth of workers) consume 4 RAT, 4 DW,  and 0.5 OVE.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	is there any way to layer certain tiles that don't need to be visible all the time?


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT.CI1 and DW.CI1 for prices there...


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	and can workers starve, or do they just stop working?


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Their efficiency goes WAY down.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing is that it represents about 800 CIS in expenses each day for each BMP.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	so I don't need to worry about them all dying if I ever can't log on though correct?


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Correct.  Your base may be in shambles and you'll be shipping stuff to get some credits to get it back up.


[08-Jan-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	yay :)


[08-Jan-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Aside, if you're doing BMP... you might want to look at a FRM or two... or three.  Aside from making food for RAT, it can also make RCO.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RCO + PE -> OVE (another BMP thing)


[08-Jan-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	OVE.CI1


[08-Jan-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	BMP?


[08-Jan-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The Basic Materials Plant - where you're making MCG.


[08-Jan-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	ah okay


[08-Jan-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	BMP = basic money printer


[08-Jan-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	;)


[08-Jan-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and if you have an INC (burning the GRN that a FRM makes), it makes C... which you can do C + H -> PE which is used in that PE + RCO -> OVE


[08-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As long as its cheaper to make it than buy it, there's profit to be had.


[08-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	yep :)


[08-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	@Knarfaction I like that idea of a basic money printer... :)


[08-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	where can I get one? ;)


[08-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Did you start as a farmer or a manufacturing profession?


[08-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	you already have 2 XD


[08-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Knarfaction**:	new buffer: BUI BMP


[08-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	@shagie the one that makes BSE


[08-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Ahh, construction.  With a PP1


[08-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	just checked, it's contructor


[08-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	yep


[08-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have the workforce for 100 PIO (might need a HB1), and get 6 BSE, 4 BBH, and 2 BDE... and build it.


[08-Jan-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sandmuel**:	PIO?


[08-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Pioneers.  Tier 1 workers.


[08-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Cheapest to feed and house.


[08-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT.CI1 is a lot cheaper than FIM.CI1 (what ENGs eat)


[08-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Do a 'BUI BMP' and you'll see the workforce, and base building costs.

**xensored**:	Just a short announcement from EV1L corp: Anyone who is interested in a manufacturing planet near BEN (especially in case Katoa might switch to fuel refining in the future), may watch your direct neighbour UV-796c. PIO + SET will grow and park will also be build next days for upcoming TEC immigration. Everybody is welcome :)

[23-Jan-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrWood**:	okay when you say sell do i just right click on what minium stuff i got from my ship inventory to selll


[23-Jan-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrWood**:	a


[23-Jan-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrWood**:	and on the market where i can just buy stuff properly with the need of sending a ship out to get them


[23-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hermanek**:	you can sell on the market via button trade (it is good check the orders before to see the much goods who selling or buying for which price)


[23-Jan-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Benten is a short jaunt away.  Load up what you want in your ship, go to BEN (Benten Station) and sell it.  I'd advise also renting a warehouse there - makes it easier to think about what is where rather than having them sit in delivery contracts.


[23-Jan-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At Benten station, you'd load your ship from the warehouse or accept the delivery contracts... and then come back.


[23-Jan-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the things with having a warehouse is that you can do "oh yea, I need ..." and then have it sit there... and when you get to a full 500 t / m3 in the warehouse you can do "oh yea, let me pick up that stuff."


[23-Jan-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its useful for buying bulk quantities of water at a lower price.

[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	'BS' in a new buffer


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Then hit "ADD" next to an existing base


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	oh man thanks, i have been lookign everywherer


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You can have 3 permits dedicated to a base for a max of 1000 area :]


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	ok i guess i just hit the max than just bought my 3rd


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	No problem at all man


[24-Jan-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MysteriousWalrus**:	You doing agriculture here?


[24-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	yeah mainly with some side stuff so may move that stuff off in the future


[24-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	just putting off looking around for a spot


[24-Jan-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Definitely - I started on Promitor, then when I maxed it out I moved my food processors off world to Avalon.


[24-Jan-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	avalon have food ind bonus?


[24-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah


[24-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I think the equivalent for Proxion would be... Milliways (KW-020c)


[24-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	nice thanks forthe tips


[24-Jan-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	No problem! I'm not exactly used to Benten space but look at having a bit of a foothold here :]


[24-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	Sorry to bug yah again but how do you change currency?


[24-Jan-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fonzy**:	found it FXPO


[24-Jan-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Quick links are currency / currency.  So CIS/NCC which is different than NCC/CIS


[24-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that Lowstrife tries to keep the lower half of the FX chart not out of whack prices... and so in that pairing, NCC/CIS should be the preferred choice.


[24-Jan-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, bringing a new WCB online in... some point in the near future.  It will be mostly dedicated to a Circe - MOR - XH-594 - BEN - Proxion route.

**shagie**:	Most important thing for Proxion - don't RIG for water.


[30-Jan-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I heard


[30-Jan-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Too slow or what?


[30-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Very very low concentration herd


[30-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Way too slow.  It has difficulty supporting the rate FRMs consume it ... and you're filling up your base space with HB1s for people working on RIGs who are eating and drinking...


[30-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	More cost efficient to buy it at the station :]


[30-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And so the cost of making the water becomes higher than the cost of buying it at H2O.CI1


[30-Jan-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I ship mine in all the way from Frost (where I've got a water creating base)


[30-Jan-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sand consumes 625 H2O / day making DW ... shipping a few thousand down here when I head this way is easy.


[30-Jan-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For this area, Etherwind, Milways, and Proxion form the RAT & DW set.


[30-Jan-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Etherwind produces 42 H2O / rig / day.  Proxion produces 8 H2O / r/d.


[30-Jan-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	great when players come back! For C around BEN if you want to base it on HYFs, you can just work on a standard setup with H2O from Etherwind, HYFs on KW-020d, FRMs on Prox/Nemesis and full INC on Tacotopia. I think that the most common setup at the moment


[31-Jan-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Tacotopia looks quite a way out, I take it that it was the next planet which did not need special resources to build on? I remember that was a pain in the bottom when trying to find the planet which became Milliways.


[31-Jan-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And there's this really nice planet named Verdant that has... what... 200 more plots available.


[31-Jan-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	eh, I don't know anything about that half of the universe xD


[31-Jan-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeahh I made sure to get a spot on all the agricultural planets I could due to them filling up..still kicking myself for not snatching Vallis when I had the chance


[31-Jan-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	At some point, the advice for new players will be "start out as a farmer, otherwise you'll not have an accessible agri world if you should want to do that."

[01-Feb-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Foefighter**:	Good but almost full i mean


[01-Feb-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and I'd head north for that instead rather than south.


[01-Feb-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	C (via CLR) -> 100x NCS.NC1 which has a 2k / day (12k/ week) units traded in Moria.

[02-Feb-24 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	3 green planet, positive fertility and near CX, i was surprises it wasnt full when i made my base 20 days ago


[02-Feb-24 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I suppose that's true, but 12 people in one day is wild


[02-Feb-24 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	It's the rush to fill up those last spots. I grabbed one with just a CM for now, so I could have it when I'm ready for my next phase of expansion (I need more ships).


[02-Feb-24 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Still sad I missed Montem, so I didn't want to regret not grabbing Proxion, and I suspect there are others who felt the same.


[02-Feb-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	That's fair, I guess I didn't think about just sending CM resources


[02-Feb-24 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	im going to do the same thing on Harmonia


[02-Feb-24 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	its almost full too


[02-Feb-24 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	It's so far away though.


[02-Feb-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	going to use to make HER, only need to send a ship once or twice per month


[02-Feb-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-24 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I'm 100% joking)


[02-Feb-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	there is also nemesis (JS-299a) thats closer but it still have 205 open plots


[02-Feb-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	5 jumps, 65 FF on min burn, just under a day from here.


[02-Feb-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	there is also pyrgos (CH-771a) but it has even more open plots


[02-Feb-24 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	336


[02-Feb-24 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nemesis is adjancet to JS-601c which runs confused COGC with Resource and Metal flipping.


[02-Feb-24 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	but its quite a bit out of the way


[02-Feb-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	The german release.


[02-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Part of the "why it was a bit awkward" was because they were also doing a presentation on a twitch stream of a writer ... in German about the game being in German.

[05-Feb-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	As advanced notice to all, my PRO license is running out in 3 months approximately. At that time I would like to step down from position of governor. If there are any who are interested, feel free to discuss with me; additionally, if @Dover is also still interested as prior governor, I'd be happy to hand things to him. Since picking up a second job, I've not had as much free time and it's difficult to balance work and game responsibilities while having time for other life things, and it's probably for the best to step down to avoid causing issues for other players.

**DYSIODE**:	What is up with all these huge LM orders for goods priced below even the COGM price? I could understand if it were small orders to either get newer players to sell or whatever, but who is flying around with 2169 BSE they want to lose money on?


[07-Feb-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	In corp trades.


[07-Feb-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah, that's mostly us... (KAWA/FOWL). we have lower internal prices and do a lot of trading here on Proxion


[07-Feb-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	When i do shiping with corp i tend to post it as $1 pay and then we square up with a single cont. LM is nice to be able to auto provision the load

**Insula_Crisium**:	Hello Proxion!  I figured I should snag one of those free base plots before they were all gone.


[10-Feb-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Howdy! They've been fluctuating quite a bit, honestly


[10-Feb-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Yeah, I just learned that


[10-Feb-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Do they tend to open back up as new accounts go inactive?


[10-Feb-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  I kept hoping that Montem would open back up... got a base in a box in the warehouse there...


[10-Feb-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It was down to +17 or so at one point ... now back up to +63.


[10-Feb-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you scroll up and see 'user07decafbad joined' or the like - those are deleted hard deleted accounts.  Possibly multi accounts.


[10-Feb-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and looking back, quite a few of those recently.


[10-Feb-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Oh yea... 1/25 from 10am to 11pm ... LOTS of deleted accounts there.


[10-Feb-24 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also possible those are in the "created account, timeout" - Accounts less than 7 days old will be notified after 3 days of inactivity and deleted 5 days afterwards

[14-Feb-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bitbucket**:	It'll be a long time; take this as the opportunity to learn the ropes now so when if/when a reset happens you know what to do and can hit the ground running in the next 'verse.

**shagie**:	'ello.  One of the things to remeber about the game is that its... slow.  Things take place over days and weeks.  Often its a tab open on the browser at work.  Weekends are a bit slower.  Planet chat has fewer people than global (or help).

[19-Feb-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the things I'd like to remind new players of - Proxion is _dry_.  Buy your water at Benten for H2O.CI1


[19-Feb-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It will be cheaper than trying to build sufficient RIGs (and staff them) to water the farms.


[19-Feb-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Dear CIM stop sending me contracts offering to buy my HCP


[19-Feb-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Its like going to a car dealership to buy two tons of steel


[19-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What are they offering for a rate?


[19-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	218 a pop


[19-Feb-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	"No matter what those big wigs say in corporate about “hydrocarbon plants”, grain should be first on the list of things to burn. Those plants are a bit more thirsty than simple grain and if you’re just shoveling them into the incinerator it’s all the same. Now, if you start turning up the temp, then it burns more, and faster and you need those hydrocarbon plants to make it all work right for some reason."


[19-Feb-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I'm burning hcp/mai/grn


[19-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Triple burn... ok... just making sure.


[19-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I did my math, no worries


[19-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	👍


[19-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Need a little transfusion of HCP when import my grn and mai


[19-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The first time I was shipping things I did single HCP and went "wait a moment..."


[19-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And I think the tutorials try to get you to burn HCP.


[19-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	But I'm working on getting some 2 more farms and a hab so I can grow my own


[19-Feb-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you looked at setting up on Etherwind?


[19-Feb-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I've looked at some other planets, but I haven't given it any serious thought


[19-Feb-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The triad for Benten space for agri is: Promitor (FRMs), Etherwind (H2O, C), and Millways (FP and FER)


[19-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sorry, Proxion - not Promitor.


[19-Feb-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	KW-688c is a water world running resource extraction.


[19-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	FP and FER?


[19-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'd be able to get cheaper water there and the INC will run faster.


[19-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Food Processors and Fermenters (if you're growing some HER for KOM.CI1)


[19-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Mm


[19-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Millways runs food industry COGC - so the FPs and FER run faster there... and this then frees up more space for FRMs on Proxion.


[19-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I'll think about it


[19-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its not a "right now" thing - once you fill up your first permit here, then you start looking at what to do with the second permit.


[19-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	But I'm probably going to expand my current base first yeah


[19-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Skip out on shipping to myself for a bit


[19-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Oh nice


[19-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Just now got another agriculture expert


[19-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Huzzah!


[19-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Ah nice 6.96% becomes 12.48%


[19-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Love it


[19-Feb-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gets even better with the 5th.


[19-Feb-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... which _also_ is why having a base on Etherwind is helpful... since the resource extraction bonus you can get 5 experts there to boost the INC.

**shagie**:	Etherwind has AWFUL fertility.  FRMs there are really bad.


[19-Feb-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're shipping water from Etherwind, you've got a lopsided shipping where ships are going empty often.


[19-Feb-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(This is the Boucher problem)


[19-Feb-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then you get to use the more efficient INC on Etherwind, and have more goods heading out too.


[19-Feb-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Etherwind -(H2O)-> Proxion


[19-Feb-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Etherwind -(C)-> Benten


[19-Feb-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion -(burnables, RAT, DW)-> Etherwind


[19-Feb-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then, as the expansion happens, Millways gets added into the mix for RAT and DW which go to Etherwind and Proxion.


[19-Feb-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Or Millways gets added sooner if not as C focused... so many choices.


[19-Feb-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	That's interesting, thanks Shagie. I'm thinking of opening and Etherwind base soon, and sounds like transporting between here and there is pretty advantageous.


[19-Feb-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The empty inbound capacity problem is one that I have with agri worlds.  The more you can ship into them, the better.  I took off all the FP on Verdant so that I'd have more room for FRMs... and to have something to ship _into_ Verdant when I go there.

**EnemyCube**:	I still haven't figured out where Proxion or Etherwind fit into my production. in the longer term I think it's easier but I'm not using Proxion at all yet and need to change that


[19-Feb-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For me, Proxion is a HER world.  Longer cycle times means I'm not as rushed to move its goods to Sand where I make FIM and KOM.  I've got a little bit of LST on the side for some BFabs and FLX.


[19-Feb-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I like that idea, I just can't source a high enough quantity of DDT yet, especially with rising prices. I should be able to get more chemistry online soon and fix that but it's taking a while


[19-Feb-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I think I'm going to switch back to making RAT on Verdant+Sand, make DW and C on etherwind using proxion and go from there


[19-Feb-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I ship it down from Circe.  Got another 87 on route...


[19-Feb-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Currently use 7 / day...


[19-Feb-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... there's 50 (batches of 10) on the LM.


[19-Feb-24 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Drop some MHL on the CX at a fair price


[19-Feb-24 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	avialable for quick fulfilment


[19-Feb-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it's definitely available on the market, but I use 20/day and the price has gone from ~2700 when I first started to 3800 currently so I never have more than a few hundred.


[19-Feb-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	It's getting better as I make more money but still a hurdle


[19-Feb-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Heh - Verdant, Sand, Circe, Proxion, Etherwind (rather than Frost) ... that's a familiar set of bases.


[19-Feb-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	At the moent they are paying way over the odds for Carbon compared to Benten so keep them coming :p


[20-Feb-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gasgano**:	Its random in big part, so you can get a contract to deliver sth you have never had on you colony far far away for price lower than the goods, not to mention the fuel


[20-Feb-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	But you can decline all 3 without penalty?


[20-Feb-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Good to know, I was wondering if we had another Swanada character or just rogue joker


[20-Feb-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT.AI1 has been volatile for a bit - not sure how much is this.  RAT.NC1 had some weirdness back on the 10th, but the volume didn't show anything too weird ... it may be going up as people try to do some arbitrage here.


[20-Feb-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RAT.IC1 is... I don't know whats up that that market either.  Doesn't look like any weirdness in the volume.


[20-Feb-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Perhaps the rumored explosion in need for basic consumables with a growing population base, we are over 400 online more often it seems

***Reyght** joined.*


[20-Feb-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's also that.  Consider also that Antares has been having a PR push and tends to have people bias to making AL.AI1 and related products than RAT.AI1 ... and so RAT.IC1 and RAT.CI1 are the two that are most immediately imported.


[20-Feb-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	IC1 has a very deep order book for RAT.  CI1 not as deep (even before the clearing) though it was rather steady before.


[20-Feb-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I suspect in general, this is going to cause the price to stabalize at a higher value since there's no "agreed" upon value that you can see in the order book any more.


[20-Feb-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Interesting points, I noticed the aluminum difference and shipped some from antares to moria for a little profit while needing an otherwise empty ship filled heading that way. I'll try to bring extra rations when passing through HRT on the way back to Antares. Learning the supply chain flows between exchanges more and more, part of why I built my first bases by the 4 main ones - to have a reason to travel between them


[20-Feb-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Oddly (kind of), iron based things (looking at MFK.AI1 vs MFK.NC1) are more expensive down in Antares.


[20-Feb-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Compare those two order books.

[22-Feb-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	While its only proxy - consider CXM FE - NC1 trades more FE in a day that AI1 does in a week.  Go to AL, and that's reversed.


[22-Feb-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The core Antares worlds that have FE are ZV-307d ZV-307e - which... aren't that great.  Vulcan would be the place at ZV-759b ... but Phobos is the only 3 green world in AI space that has FEO.

**shagie**:	Compare with the FE depsoits of Vallis, Sabaton (TO-392d), Circa (QQ-001a) and Circe, Kiruna, and even OZ-189a and RC-040c ... and we're still at 4 jumps away from Moria.


[22-Feb-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Arcadia (YI-683c) is at 6 jumps is still closer than most meh deposits of FE in distance from the CX for Antares.

**Circle_of_Life**:	heavy shipments


[22-Feb-24 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's why you make 'em into SFK and MFK.


[22-Feb-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	... and also why FEO is even less appealing in Antares space.


[22-Feb-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(I've got a pair of bases in XH-594 and have a in system ship that is dedicated to shuttling FE one way and whatever I've dropped off on Libertas the other)


[23-Feb-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Whoa, Libertas and Kiruna are interesting...

[23-Feb-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm looking at it in part because I've got NA pouring out my ears with chem... and NA -> NAB -> SF would me a profitable chain that would supplement / replace / export the SF consumption in that system.

**TAfirehawk**:	Hello friends.  I have been discussing running for governor with NorseFTX and will be running next term.  I have a good handle on all the upkeep so I can maintain the awesome job that NorseFTX has done.  I am relatively new to PrUn and thankfully I have KAWA to support this new endeavor.


[26-Feb-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	:o Thanks so much for stepping up for this @TAfirehawk. I'll support with what I can until my license runs out. Here's to continued prosperity on Proxion!


[26-Feb-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Feb-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Because as far as I can tell, every production slot will take whatever is in the first queue slot if its recurring


[29-Feb-24 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	When you create a new building, the first one spams it all... but after that, it settles out.


[29-Feb-24 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its a one time thing that isn't too much of an issue in the long term.


[29-Feb-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@KatoHearts If multiple queued recurring orders, they cycle.  Once one is used, it gets thrown to the back of the pending queue.

**shagie**:	For RIGs, it will cost you more for RAT, DW, OVE, and repairs for the RIG itself to get the water than it would cost to buy the water at Benten station for H2O.CI1

[05-Mar-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	You'd pay less for finished product here then at BEN?  Unless you like paying 700 a unit for COF


[05-Mar-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**t3hpr0phet**:	its not about what you're willing to pay for, its what the seller is willing to say for.  i'd love to buy COF for less than 700, but if i can sell COF for 700 i'm not going to sell it less than that...


[05-Mar-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Katinga**:	If a local economy can be established, it would benefit producers.  Surplus could still be exported to BEN.  if you don't like the idea then no one is twisting your arm.


[05-Mar-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	It costs time and fuel to get products to a CX.  so the profit margin wouldn't really change that much


[05-Mar-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I'd say local economies are part of what the LM is for.


[05-Mar-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Generally, they're rarely used, which I think is a shame, since contracts have some major advantages over the CX. I'd love to see a more active LM.


[05-Mar-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Something that comes to mind is a player on Prom always sells OVE and PWO at a very good price on the Prom local market


[05-Mar-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	Most players dont need to buy those from the CX as a result, we know we can count on those LM contracts


[05-Mar-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	are the prices at the benten CX that high right now in comparison to regular pricing?


[05-Mar-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-24 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I believe it's mostly because there are now more players in the game. As a result, consumables consumption has gone up, and there probably hasn't been a corresponding increase in production to compensate. It's a good market to be a victualer.

**shagie**:	... Though 1000 is fairly close to break even for HOP.  I expect it to stay above 1500 / u going forward and at that price, might as well make some (and sell some) too.


[13-Mar-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Lowstrife listed some in a bracket on HOP.NC1 - and no more supply has appeared since he did that ... and he sold 30 units in the last 24h.


[13-Mar-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	My main source of revenue is AFABS but I am only making them for a base upgrade right now (22). So, I am having to generate credits with consumables over stock.


[13-Mar-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Most of mine is from food on Sand.  Need to scale up Frost for some more water too... RAT, DW, FIM, KOM, and ALE.


[13-Mar-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	ORC is a pain because of the TEC requirement, but you should do okay on Proxion.


[13-Mar-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - Proxion has an unusually educated workforce.


[13-Mar-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant has 304 tech with 3.5% unemployment... it could support another few orchards ... but that also means ripping out several FRMs.


[13-Mar-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Proxion has 5219 techs with 29.5% unemployment.


[13-Mar-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(there's even employed engineers and sci here)


[13-Mar-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I use Proxion for FRM mostly. I used Proxion to upgrade my ships and build an extra small ship.


[13-Mar-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I've got 11 FRMs, one FP (for local RAT), and 2 EXT (for LST until I relocate that).  Mostly HER production - I import DDT from Circe ... which means I've got the stuff there for the ORC too.


[13-Mar-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Building ships was too intense for me, while doing manufacturing on Katoa.


[13-Mar-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Gonna put a Manufacturing base on Circa once I've got an in system ship for the Circe - Circa run.


[13-Mar-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	btw, have you ever poked at a system inv buffer?


[13-Mar-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	INV UV-351


[13-Mar-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I can make DDT here on Proxion if you get stuck.


[13-Mar-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Circe is producing 20 a day currently.  All the FRMs currently only use 6.7 / day.


[13-Mar-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	No, I will try it. (system inv buffer)


[13-Mar-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also works with BS and FLT.


[13-Mar-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Oh. I have INV on my left side bar.


[13-Mar-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	FLT and BS as well.


[13-Mar-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I also put CALC there.


[13-Mar-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You use the PMMG browser extension, don't you.


[13-Mar-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.   I've got a screen for managing the XH-594 system.

[13-Mar-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The RHS has FLT, INV, and BS and only shows the things in that system.


[13-Mar-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	My layout is much simpler. I bring up buffers as needed. Usually from the BS and FLT buffers.


[13-Mar-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have a Benten manager, you could pull up all the inventories in system (other than the station warehouse) and all the bases as buffers - without having other stuff in the lists.


[13-Mar-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You could also have an xit list buffer.

[14-Mar-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	not trying to speak for TAfirehawk, but just as another KAWA person helping provide upkeep, we actually opperate on the same low internal prices that NorseFTX was using to balance a lot of taxes. And I must say it was a very impressively tight balance. So population change could throw it a bit, but no change should be neccessary as of right now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The super low taxes here for such a large population are a testament to how well Norse did, I'm hoping some day I can drop Katoa's lower like this too

**KatoHearts**:	The queue is not sufficient


[16-Mar-24 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The queues do not work this way.  I would suggest using Prun Planner or PMMG extended to tinker with the order sizes so that does the ratio you want.


[16-Mar-24 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you have 4 farms and want 3 of them to always be producing BEA, GRN, and NUT tweak the other ratios so that the BEA, GRN, and NUT ratios are 25% each.


[16-Mar-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Sounds like a lot of work for something that shouldn't be a problem


[16-Mar-24 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you adjusted the ratios so that you're doing ... I did this math last night, let me look it up again.


[16-Mar-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HCP x 6; GRN x 4; MAI x 1


[16-Mar-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN x 3 rather.


[16-Mar-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	No, why would I, it would mess with my current understanding of my timing and production


[16-Mar-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Because that will produce the agri you are after in the proper ratios.


[16-Mar-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Because I can't tell a farmer "Keep growing corn" for some reason


[16-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's not how the system works ... and that would mess it up _more_ since the MAI farm would out produce the other ones.


[16-Mar-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I believe that you want each cycle 24 HCP, 12 GRN, and 12 MAI to be produced.


[16-Mar-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I'm already making way more corn than I want because it keeps wandering into the queue

**shagie**:	From Prun Planner.


[16-Mar-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You will note that even with the uneven rates of growth for MAI and GRN, that the ratios produced (right hand side) are even.


[16-Mar-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You could also change that from the 1 H2O to 4 H2O for GRN ... it would make the entire thing run faster - it will not change the ratios.


[16-Mar-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Naw


[16-Mar-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Use the repeating orders and the order size to set up the ratios and work with the queues rather than trying to micro manage them.


[16-Mar-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	They will do the right thing when you have the ratios right.


[16-Mar-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Yeah it's really way more intuitive than telling a single farm to repeat


[16-Mar-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	meanwhile I try and puzzle out how to actually use prun plannet


[16-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	Sorry, I'm just getting really annoyed


[16-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Telling one FRM to repeat (which is not how the system was designed) would make the MAI over production worse.


[16-Mar-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I'll deal with this tomorrow


[16-Mar-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	I would rather have MAI overproduction than it deciding not to grow something else I need


[16-Mar-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's where you make sure that you've got enough production to match the intake.


[16-Mar-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	WIthout any agri bonuses, you will need 3 FRMs for 1 INC running the 3x burn.


[16-Mar-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KatoHearts**:	There's literally nothing good I can say right now so I'm just going to let this conversation die


[16-Mar-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	when a recurring order from the queue begins production that order will then be added to the bottom of the queue. That means that even though the differing production times sometimes make the active peoduction look weird, you will *always* produce exactly the ratio you need. You don't need to babysit anything, just give it time and the outputs will always be equal to the ratio of the recurring recipes in the queue


[16-Mar-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Do you need three FRMs? Maize grows in 30 hours, the fast burn takes 10 hours. Fast burn therefore needs 60 hours to burn 1 maize cycle.


[16-Mar-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	1 maize cycle is about 3 of another plant


[16-Mar-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	If you queue up an order for 24 HCP, then an order for 12 GRN, then an order for 12 MAI, and then just keep cycling in that order, the timing of any individual FRM doesn't matter, you'll always be growing whatever it is you need next, and you'll always have the right amount of them.

**NonRedibimus**:	So you can grow 1 maize and 9 cycles of the other two plants in the time it takes to burn all the maize


[16-Mar-24 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Trying to pick what any individual FRM is doing is a waste of time. Just repeat the order. Whenever any order finishes, add whatever comes next in the queue.


[16-Mar-24 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I"m grappling with this problem as well because I started up as carbon farmer on Proxion


[16-Mar-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Since I saw carbon prices were great around here and somehow Proxion to the Benten station is faster than Benten to Benten Station.


[16-Mar-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	FTL speed can be faster than in system speed.


[16-Mar-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	So yeah, you technically finish the burn slightly faster than the growing cycles 6 cycles of crops, by about 3 hours, but it's still faster production than doing two-crop speed


[16-Mar-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I need the same number of BEA, NUT, and MAI to make RATs. I queue up 12 BEA, 12 NUT, 12 MAI, 4 HER, 12 BEA, 4 HER, 12 NUT, 12 MAI, 4 HER, etc on and on just queueing up in that order, adding in HER as needed.


[16-Mar-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I don't need tot rakc what farm is growing what crop, at any given time they're always growing whatever I have least of, because they just finished something I know have more of.


[16-Mar-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	It doesn't matter if I have 1 FRM or a dozen, just queue up how many you need in the ratio you need it.

[16-Mar-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I feel like if I picked up a third FRM, it would mostly be to start producing RAT fodder in the excess from carbon plants


[16-Mar-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Am I right in thinking Proxion's water reserves aren't really worth extracting myself? The building construct menu doesn't forecast how good the extraction would be.


[16-Mar-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	RIGs on Proxion cost more to run for the water than buying H2O.CI1


[16-Mar-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	PrunPlanner puts the cost per unit to get water from a RIG here at 56 CIS per unit.


[16-Mar-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Yeah, figured. Looks more efficient to extract the LST and sell it for water if I'm so inclined to do a resource at all


[16-Mar-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This gets to a "what is the most profitable thing to do" - and that can change with the market.


[16-Mar-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I had a smelter on Benten and it wasn't going so hot. This is my COLIQ because it looked like the Benten exchange had shortage of carbon and plants


[16-Mar-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For me, Proxion's FRMs run equal ratios of BEA / GRN / NUT which I have a FP produce food locally (reduces the amount I need to ship here) - but mostly I make HER.


[16-Mar-24 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	79% of my FRM capacity is churning out HER.  Only 7% is on BEA / GRN / NUT each.


[16-Mar-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're looking at C, consider branching out to Etherwind at some point.


[16-Mar-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Being a water world, it runs resource extraction - which is also the bonus that INC uses.


[16-Mar-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	So I would want to build up enough money to replace the incinerator I've already built here


[16-Mar-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And yep - at some point, when you have the funds to spin up a base on Etherwind, you'll want to do that.  Then build RIGs and INCs there - you can ship water from there to here (rather than buying it) and ship burnables from here to there.


[16-Mar-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you want to go with food as the focus, Milliways is a food industry planet that does FP and FER faster (and again, frees up area here)


[16-Mar-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I have a RAT/DW triangle going between Prox (Agri), Etherwind (H2O) and Milliways (FP)


[16-Mar-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Something you can consider when you plan expansions


[16-Mar-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(heh, Antares is getting desperate for booze... HOP.AI1 is going up there even faster)


[16-Mar-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	When all the plots fill up on a planet, that's just it though?


[16-Mar-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	So if I don't reach Etherwind before it fills up, I'm basically subject to the market on water


[16-Mar-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's correct, though I highly doubt it will fill up so soon


[16-Mar-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Correct... though it goes up and down... and 181 there isn't going to be for a long while yet.


[16-Mar-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	JS-299a isn't bad either.


[16-Mar-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's Nemesis... another agri planet.


[16-Mar-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But Etherwind (KW-588c is nice)


[16-Mar-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	KW-688c (I need new glasses)


[16-Mar-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll also note the favorable O levels - especially nice if you are looking at getting back into smelting again at some point.


[17-Mar-24 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	What's the name of the core item for constructing a base? I can't seem to find it again.


[17-Mar-24 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It won't appear as it isn't for sale, but you can use BUI CM to see the materials in it

[17-Mar-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I've played this setup like half as long and made nearly 10x profit


[17-Mar-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	What about Victualler?


[17-Mar-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	Just started as that so hopefully that's not too bad of a choice.


[17-Mar-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I am told that's even better.


[17-Mar-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	My actual next steps are to hybridize my setup with victualler


[17-Mar-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	Nice, I am a noob so I hoped for the most "streamlined" haha.


[17-Mar-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	pick up an extra farm, a food processor, start producing both lines of products


[17-Mar-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	For Carbon Farmer, it's the hydrocarbon plants right?


[17-Mar-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I do a mix of all three, actually


[17-Mar-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	HCP/GRN/MAI


[17-Mar-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	Oh I just saw you can mix and match in the incinerator, very interesting.


[17-Mar-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	After much menial calculation, I concluded that BEA+NUT+GRN is the most efficient in terms of H20 consumption for Vict.


[17-Mar-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Burning that mix takes 9 hours, 6 batches of ingredients takes about 60 hours


[17-Mar-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Only a small gap in the production there.


[17-Mar-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	And you can cover that gap by spending a little more on grain water


[17-Mar-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	Much to think about. Better send a ship to the exchange for some more BSE haha


[17-Mar-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I noticed hte tutorial quests give me BBH and BDE and other construction parts, but I don't know if there's an 'intended' fourth building they're preparing me for.


[17-Mar-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Are you victualler?


[17-Mar-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	carbon farmer, so close enough


[17-Mar-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	There's a command for your recommended buildings...


[17-Mar-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Which I built all of.


[17-Mar-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	same


[17-Mar-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	The tutorial quests give you more construction materials after the start set of materials.


[17-Mar-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**tyro12**:	good to know, maybe I'll hold off on spending the CIS then


[17-Mar-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	rsb


[17-Mar-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	After that, as a C farmer, probably just more FRMs if I had to guess.


[17-Mar-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Papi, as we said already, we have built everything in RSB


[17-Mar-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	With enough HB1


[17-Mar-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TAfirehawk**:	CI1 is Ben CX


[17-Mar-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Note that you don't have to only make carbon.  If you dislike importing RAT and have the spare FRM capacity, put down a FP.  If you don't have spare FRM capacity, put down another FRM.


[17-Mar-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	prunplanner looks spot on for bid/ask on RAT and DW for CI1 Ben CX


[17-Mar-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can sell off surplus (or make a 'cash' like RCO that you sell directly - though check on the "what sells for the most per unit time")


[17-Mar-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Yeah, i'm running numbers on what it takes to hybridize with an FP and it looks profitable


[17-Mar-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Is there a way to tell prunplanner what buildings I've already constructed so it can remove them from the materials needed list?


[17-Mar-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	sure, in the Construction list you can change quantity

**CptColeslaw**:	just growing GRN (with the faster 4 H2O recipe) is the most cost effective recipe for easy C


[17-Mar-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That also gets into interesting math questions ... that get a bit more interesting when water is an operational cost that needs stocking rather than a local resource with a surplus.


[17-Mar-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I think you actually make more on the three crop C recipe since it produces more per day opposed to operational costs


[17-Mar-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Unless you want to invest in extra incinerators to try to keep up


[17-Mar-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That depends on the price of C.  Currently, that's likely true.  During the Great C Bear (a few months ago) when the price of C was down to 500 it was sufficient to cause the increased cost of good manufacturing to make the lower cost GRN (and burns) to come out ahead.

**DeanRexxTTV**:	Dude, this game is so intimidating, how do I even play...


[21-Mar-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	the UI can be a little daunting, but the dense informatiion is eventually very useful. Have you watched the tutorial videos yet?


[21-Mar-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	No. I just installed and launched the game for the first time after seeing a stock market was in it


[21-Mar-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	xD fair, I think you'll fit right in, lol. It's not really a "stock market", just a market for physical goods, but it's pretty cool and there's a lot of possibility


[21-Mar-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	This feels like if Elite Dangerous was 1000x more in-depth, played completely from a single terminal, a lot less spacey and a lot more technical


[21-Mar-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	there's an old video by SeaPear about the "trader" start that you might enjoy. Somehting Shaggie can also share some knowledge on, I'm sure they'll show up in this chat some time, they're full of knowledge


[21-Mar-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	It's like if you was a space-station owner on Elite Dangerous, that's the vibe


[21-Mar-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I'm a rare full-time trader in PrUn, ask me anything. 😁


[21-Mar-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Just not questions about production- I'm quite ignorant there.


[21-Mar-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	And I would second CptColeslaw's advice to watch the videos. They're good for the basics.


[21-Mar-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have no idea how to play this, I have a basic mats plant and I have 100 units of MCG being made, but that'll take 10 hours so im gonna go binge watch tutorial videos


[21-Mar-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Mar-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have started spreadsheeting...


[22-Mar-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I'm trapped in this eternal universe.


[22-Mar-24 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Also, I have no way of obtaining BDE so if anyone could fly over to my base and deliver a single unit (I only need one) I would greatly appreciate it :)

**DeanRexxTTV**:	Still very new to this :)


[22-Mar-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Or if anyone knows how I can get a hold of BDE or place a market order


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	hey, so you got an issue and are missing a single BDE?


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I need to make a prefab plant but I'm missing a single BDE yes


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have no way to fabricate BDE since I need a prefab plant to do so


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	okay, do you got a ship at proxion or the benten exchange?


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	and also how much money do you have left?


[22-Mar-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have two BP-STRT-0000 / AVI stationed at my base on UV-796b


[22-Mar-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	How would I check my money?


[22-Mar-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have 11,404 CIS


[22-Mar-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	okay, since i assume you are quite new, have you ever used the exchange before?


[22-Mar-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	No, I do have a custom screen for tracking Repair Kit's though since I see a relatively gentle market to join there


[22-Mar-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	also if you don't mind asking, what profession did you choose?


[22-Mar-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Manufacturer I believe


[22-Mar-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I prefer to be a freelancer, kind of a jack of all trades


[22-Mar-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	My thought process was that if I could be flexible enough, I could join and supply any commodity and market, benefit where I can


[22-Mar-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	yeah i assume one will eventually get to that (i am also relatively new) but you should try to stick to the profession the first days since getting the mats to build more is quite an investment at the start


[22-Mar-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	but back to your main question


[22-Mar-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
***DeanRexxTTV** deleted this message.*


[22-Mar-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	^ ignore that


[22-Mar-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	What you would normally do is if you need stuff, you go to the exchange, in this case Benten, and buy the stuff you need there


[22-Mar-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	BDE.CI1


[22-Mar-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	How do I go there, do I actually have to send a ship, then through that ship trade for things I need, and then bring that ship back to base?


[22-Mar-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	so if you chose manufacturer profession, it should have recommended you build 2 habs and 2 BMPs i think, correct?


[22-Mar-24 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	yes, that is correct, you will have to send the ship and bring it back to get the goods


[22-Mar-24 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Yes but I have only built a single BMP, I don't see reason to build two, I don't mind the wait I am very patient


[22-Mar-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	that is your choice, though keep in mind if you build the second BMP you can produce more, wait and then sell the commodities you produced at the exchange


[22-Mar-24 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	look at it like this, the material you have leftover is sitting in the your inventory unused and i assume the game gives you the materials necessary to produce using the BMP. If you build a building like a prefab plant, you may need to also buy the necessary materials to start production


[22-Mar-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	True, however I intend on mass producing basic construction resources early on, such as BBH, BDE, and BSE, I need to figure out how to create my own supply of iron and poly-ethelyne though...


[22-Mar-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	iron you would need to mine and iron does not exist on this planet


[22-Mar-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	if you want your own supply


[22-Mar-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	So I have to send a fleet of miners to another planet to source my iron? That would take way too long and the fuel cost would outweigh my profits


[22-Mar-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	no, you will have to settle on a second planet to then place extractors on it to mine iron and then ship it


[22-Mar-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	but your guess is correct


[22-Mar-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	that would be quite a burden especially early on


[22-Mar-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	So extractors are how I source a planet's natural resources?


[22-Mar-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	Extractors for ores and minerals that you mine, Rigs for liquids and collectors for gases


[22-Mar-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Makes sense, you're very helpful by the way, thanks for taking the time for a newbie like me


[22-Mar-24 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	i am also quite new too, started only 2 weeks ago


[22-Mar-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	"Two weeks of consistency can equal to a lifetime of procrastination."


[22-Mar-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	- Me, right now


[22-Mar-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	xD


[22-Mar-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	if i may make a recommendation: build the second BMP as per the guide, produce a profitable commodity (which you will have to wait a bit) and if you got enough send a ship to the exchange to sell that. Then buy more supplies for your BMPS and also pioneers. Then if you got enough money use that to buy the building materials to expand your production or branch out early on like you wanted to


[22-Mar-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I'm pretty sure I'm never going to leave this game alone, I want to hold a monopoly on everything and I have played for 20 minutes total xD


[22-Mar-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	i know that feeling xD


[22-Mar-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	but that will likely take quite a bit of time


[22-Mar-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Okay, just to get a basic income I'll follow the guide, thanks :)


[22-Mar-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	yeah that would be my recommendation. Maybe giving you an example will help to understand why


[22-Mar-24 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	I am personally a carbon farmer, so i needed to build i believe 2 farms, an incinerator and a hab or something like that


[22-Mar-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	What is the nearest exchange to UV-796b


[22-Mar-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I want to minimize fuel costs and maximize take-home profits


[22-Mar-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	^ Obviously


[22-Mar-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	farms need water, i used that to make plants to burn for carbon. After i got enough money i invested in more farms and incinerators and later into food proecessors. But all the water i need i still buy from the exchange


[22-Mar-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	Benten Exchange


[22-Mar-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Ok, have you got the code?


[22-Mar-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	CI1


[22-Mar-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	CX CI1


[22-Mar-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	^ is the command


[22-Mar-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	system is : UV-351


[22-Mar-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Thank you


[22-Mar-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	no problem, oh and one more thing. This comm channel is only for people on this planet. There is also a global channel and a help channel


[22-Mar-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	those tend to be more active than this one


[22-Mar-24 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Yeah, I noticed, thanks, I just chose to use this one because people closer to me might be able to provide more relevant and local support


[22-Mar-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have 150 units of MCG (totaling at 250 MCG) and 1000 units of PE being fabricated, which based on current market prices should net me 15,015 CIS, I'm only selling 174 MCG since I need 76 to make a PPmk1


[22-Mar-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	That should put me at around 34,888 CIS which I think seems to be a good start


[22-Mar-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	nice, keep in mind though that the 15,015 CIS (if i am not mistaken) is revenue and not pure profit, since you will need some of that money to buy more resources and supplies to keep production going


[22-Mar-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**uuuvster**:	Always keep your money working, having more than an emergency fund in your account is inefficient


[22-Mar-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	^ Will do, I am always going to try (eventually) to keep atleast two weeks worth of upkeep in resources and cash available so I don't go under


[22-Mar-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I'm going to stock up on the basics obviously, like rations, overalls, and water


[22-Mar-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I've placed an order for the 3 BDE I need at the Benten Exchange, and I am renting 2 warehouses at the planet that stays closest to the exchange at all times so I can store what I need


[22-Mar-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	until I can retrieve it.


[22-Mar-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	It's only 300 CIS a week which is really cheap so I thought why not


[22-Mar-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	(Seriously, why not, another planet's warehouses cost 2,000 CIS a week, why is it so cheap.)


[22-Mar-24 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	tip: you can also rent a warehouse durectky at the station housing the exchange


[22-Mar-24 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	a unit of 500t/500m³ costs 100 CIS per week


[22-Mar-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**uuuvster**:	Dirt cheap for the value it provides


[22-Mar-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I have created a private group comms channel for anyone wishing to discuss trades within the Benten Station Commodity Exchange. Please privately message me if you would like to join.


[22-Mar-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	@uuvster how much do you consider an emergency fund? how do you set/calculate that? just curious


[22-Mar-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
***loewe_306** joined.*


[22-Mar-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	For an emergency fund I would calculate what resources are being used passively over time, either by your fleet, your workforce, etc. (such as rations, drinking water, etc.). Also calculate how much money you are spending passively, such as warehouse costs, taxes, etc.


[22-Mar-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I would basically calculate and total up all of my expenses, including resource, property and administrative management (base upkeep, maintenance, repairs, etc.) expenses.


[22-Mar-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Then I would find out where the closest available local market/commodity exchange is, and calculate how much it would cost on average to supply yourself with enough resources to maintain your company.


[22-Mar-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Once I had this information, I would work to try and keep this total cost in my bank at all times, and to never dip too far below it. To calculate the safest amount to save I would do (total cost * 1.15), this would mean that I would always have my average emergency funds plus an extra 15% to cover market fluctuation, commodity price increases, and market inflation.


[22-Mar-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	If I ever needed to dip into my emergency fund to afford something, usually a crucial expense such as food, water, or repairs/maintenance, I would cut myself off if I ever had to take more than a fifth of my funds. (total emergency funds * 0.2) = Maximum Fund Usage Budget


[22-Mar-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	So for example, if I wanted an emergency fund that could cover the upkeep of my company and base for two weeks, I would do this:


[22-Mar-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	That seems unnecessarily restrictive.


[22-Mar-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	All costs are predictable


[22-Mar-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Furthermore, for the first month of the game you're going to get a ton of cash infusions from daily contracts


[22-Mar-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	i mean they are somewhat predictable, but market fluctuations do exist


[22-Mar-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	@DeanRexxTTV though thanks for you indepth answer and perspective on this


[22-Mar-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Workforce Needs Cost for 2 Weeks (I only have 200 pioneers): ((8 * 89) + (8 * 115) + (1 * 97.60)) * 14) = 24214.40 CIS


[22-Mar-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	It's alot more expensive that I thought it would be


[22-Mar-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	And thats just workforce needs


[22-Mar-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	I would add an extra 20,000 CIS for maintenance and repairs, 600 CIS for 2-weeks Warehouse Taxes, 43,036 CIS for average daily passive expenses, and 10,000 CIS for liabilities, just to be safe.


[22-Mar-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Overall I would safe an average of 97,850.40 CIS to be safe, and an extra 15% for accountability, taking me to 112,527.96 CIS. I would round it up to 113,000 CIS for memorability.


[22-Mar-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Even if prices can be apparently often predicted, I would still save this money because things can always go wrong when you least expect them to, including in real life which would prevent you from being able to play.


[22-Mar-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Again, I barely know anything about this game so I could be wrong, but from a logical and computational standpoint I'd rather be safe than sorry.


[22-Mar-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	So you're going to sit and not spend money until you accrue 100k?


[22-Mar-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	yeah, i think that is a bit too much being safe. Since if one goes that route, one would seriously hamper their abilities for a time to reinvest to make more profits


[22-Mar-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	plus liablities are if you have debt (i assume as such) so that would not be a problem unless you get a loan.


[22-Mar-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	Also while maintenance is definetly a factor, it takes quite some time for buildings to degrade. I think the rule of thumb players use (not sure though) is every 90 days. Since i believe it is very important to strike a balance between having enough capital to buy stuff if you need it and reinvesting your money to make more/futher your goals


[22-Mar-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	And the better you can plan everything out -> the less unknown or surpise costs you will have which in turn means you would have less unused money just laying around. Keep in mind though that is just my personal 2 cents.


[22-Mar-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	@NonRedibimus (01:52PM) - I'm not going to sit around, but I am going to be careful with my spending and try to save as much as possible where I can.


[22-Mar-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	What happens if my workforce satisfaction gets too low or depletes?


[22-Mar-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	They stop working as hard


[22-Mar-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Satisfaction is a straight up multiplier to the efficacy of their job production


[22-Mar-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	But seriously, I'm a week in and I have consistently spent my money down to triple digits.


[22-Mar-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	And I have never faced even a threat of bankruptcy


[22-Mar-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	The sooner you spend to invest, the faster you'll raise your daily profit


[22-Mar-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Use PRUNplanner to test different builds to find out which build will increase your profit by the most next


[22-Mar-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	It's honestly better to think of your game as a management of flow, rather than stockpiling your resources. As long as income stream is higher than costs, you're fine.


[22-Mar-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**uuuvster**:	Im amazed by how many people bother with spreadsheets. I've gotten this far by guesstimating and eyeballing future demand and expansion.


[22-Mar-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That works mostly... but there are times when the eyeballs miss things.


[22-Mar-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I mean, eyeballing works, but if you want to maximize efficiency at some point the margins get pretty tight

**DeanRexxTTV**:	Finished another table on my spreadsheet, basically as a manufacturer I can buy MGS and convert it into MG, sell it at the same station for double the value of MGS, and so I've made an automatic table on Excel to calculate profit, fuel costs, and workforce supply runs


[22-Mar-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	It's great, I can predict my profit and losses near-instantly based on current market prices

**DeanRexxTTV**:	Once I have more money I'll be able to increase my profits, but as of right now, this first supply run (for the MGS and workforce upkeep) costed 55,830.90 CIS and my sale will be roughly 67,500.00 giving me a cool profit of 11,669.10


[22-Mar-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	Once I streamline the process, and have more pioneers and BMPs I will be able to increase the profits, if I had the money and resources I could be buying up to 600 MGS, making 3,600 MG, and selling it for 270,000 CIS, and the whole trip including the MGS would only cost around 145,000 CIS


[22-Mar-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DeanRexxTTV**:	That's a 186.20% profit!


[22-Mar-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	i am unsure but did you factor in time, as in how long you will need to produce all that stuff? since depending on time or the amount of people you have to run your BMPS that could drive up costs

**NonRedibimus**:	Are there ship modifications that make it more fuel efficien?


[23-Mar-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's LHP which can help, though only kind of.


[23-Mar-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And there's also FSE (don't upgrade existing ships with a FSE - that will never pay off)


[23-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I would encourage you to not look at it as "reduce fuel use" but rather "reduce fuel use per mass/volume moved" - and there, the cargo hold upgrades (WCB especially) can be a big advantage.


[23-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I suppose I'm asking my question in a poor way. My curiosity is because I don't understand the Local Market meta here. The rates offered for shipping are rather low.


[23-Mar-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	We're so close to the CX that I'm not sure why so many local market offers are significantly beneath it.


[23-Mar-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	@shagie funny enough im not using my base here for food production. this is my prefab base cuse of the LST,H20,and O. perfect for smelting and creating the bfabs and random consumables


[23-Mar-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	@NonRedibimus are you asking why shipping prices on the LM are low, or why the buying ads are alow?


[23-Mar-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	shipping rates here seem pretty good to me, at around $10/ton.  Usually in system shipping can be as low as $5/ton.


[23-Mar-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	purchase prices on buying ads in the LM are usually a bit lower than CX though.


[23-Mar-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I guess I consider them low compared to the fuel cost of conveying them


[23-Mar-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I suspect a lot of people who pick up in system shipments are already going that route, so any extra cargo is just extra money because they would have paid the fuel cost already.  At least that's my theory. XD

**shagie**:	@Trapper69 I'll point out that the H2O here is _really_ poor.  Its cheaper to buy H2O.CI1 than it is to set up a rig.


[23-Mar-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You'll want to look at a base on Etherwind sooner than later that has better H2O and better O than Proxion.


[23-Mar-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Also with the Proxion LM - its one that some corps use as a exchange and are at prices that aren't intended for people to buy or sell at.

**Papi2Caca**:	Shagie helped me when I got started on Proxion. I was doing the same thing, I think I had 3 rigs built before shaggie mentioned I'm spending more to pump it myself vs just buying it from the CX.


[24-Mar-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The bad water (heh, that would have been a good name for the planet) here is both a blessing and a curse.  The curse is because people _try_ to put RIGs here for the water.  The blessing because once you get the "ok, import water" as the approach, it is often more productive than Verdant or even Promitor.


[24-Mar-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On Verdant, I have 10 rigs running.  That's... well, that's 10% of the total space of the base dedicated to water extraction.


[24-Mar-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I honestly don't extract water on any of my Farm planets, but I'm all about specializing. H2O is easy to ship in large quantities.

[24-Mar-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	If it is purely based on sales value, SIO makes no sense, as SIO consumes much more freight capacity


[24-Mar-24 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Starting out, SIO feeds my MCG production, but later specializing may turn Etherwind into H2O only.  Everyone plays different :)

**flasker**:	thats my goal


[24-Mar-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For chemistry, Umbra UV-351c - import HAL (and H2O from Etherwind), make CL.  Import C (from Etherwind - maybe O too) and the CL (not sure about H compared to CX) and make EPO.


[24-Mar-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Or you could take the CL and instead of EPO build a LAB and do CL + O + H and get DDT ... which you import back to Proxion and make HER which you then ship to Milliways to make FIM or KOM ... and the great cycle of goods continues.


[24-Mar-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flasker**:	are GRN MAI and HCP best for carbon? Would I still be producing RAT during this process?


[24-Mar-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Best depends on the price of water and the price of carbon ... and how many FRMs you have.


[24-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Working from base numbers (things change once you start adding in faction bonuses, planet resources, experts, and the market itself) ...


[24-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One FRM can supply 2 INC doing 4 GRN -> 4 C.


[24-Mar-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	3x FRMs are needed to supply 1 INC doing 4 HCP + 2 GRN + 2 MAI -> 4 C


[24-Mar-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The cost of C with the first is lower than the second, but the second runs 3 times faster and so it maybe profitable to do it ... if the numbers are right.

[05-Apr-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	We don't have to move Etherwind all the way here, just extend it's orbit enough that all the water freezes and we can cut out massive blocks that we then boost into Proxion


[05-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

Desolation Road
Desolation Road is a 1988 science fiction novel written by Ian McDonald. It was McDonald's first published novel. The plot takes place on a far future Mars in a town that develops around an oasis in the terraformed Martian desert. McDonald published a sequel, Ares Express, in 2001.

[05-Apr-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"Cory Doctorow called Desolation Road "one of my most personally influential novels", describing it as "an epic tale of the terraforming of Mars, whose sweep captures the birth and death of mythologies, economics, art, revolution, politics." Doctorow also compared the novel to Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (1992–1996), and noted that it pays homage to the David Byrne album The Catherine Wheel as well as the works of Ray Bradbury and Jack Vance."

***gigawitchman** joined.*


[06-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Using NUT rather than VEG you can reduce the amount of water you ship in.  It's not a _lot_, but it does make a difference over time.  The flip side is that VEG grows faster.  If you're shipping in more water / more frequently, the NUT water advantage diminishes.


[06-Apr-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But if you're looking at "shipping in 500 water (100t) that you bought at Benten" then using 0.08 H2O / NUT rather than 0.75 H2O / VEG can change how often you need to supply stuff in.

[06-Apr-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On other planets, VEG tends to be prefered to NUT.  It is slightly faster.  On Verdant, I do 4 H2O -> 4 GRN because its faster than 1 H2O -> 4 GRN (5h13m vs 6h58m)

The first taste of food a baby has is purreed beans, to the young and eager adult at 3AM half blind drunk in a TacoBell parking lot jamming a 7 layer bean burrito into his maw, to the elder with sore gums from chewing on the hard reality of life succored by the soft nutrition that soy bean tofu provides.  The bean is always there for you, and you should always keep the bean in your hearts and minds in return.

**shagie**:	@Insula I've mentioned this some on Verdant chat ( xit chat_yi-715b ).


[12-Apr-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My last tax collection for Verdant was 214,940.  The previous COGC was 217,302 to cover it.  However, I'm drawing down on the POPI stores (200 days currently) and the tech and pio population levels concern me.


[12-Apr-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Running a +100 tech program costs 50,000 ... and you can see that's more than current tax collection.  Festivities III is another option ... that runs 143,095 NCC for a week.

**CptColeslaw**:	here on proxion TAfirehawk might even be able to show a financial report soon. The government accounting sheet that NorseFTX build is incredible... and TAfirehawk is improving on that. So there's lots of data specifically on proxion income/expenses if you're interested


[12-Apr-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	@Shagie, thanks, nice data. So it sounds like Verdant's taxes cover 98% of the expenses?


[12-Apr-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I'm too lazy right now to take a deep dive into the details of running a planet, but that's still a pretty good idea. I was partially wondering because I remember Chuurvaris was saying Phobos was a lot more expensive than taxes were actually covering, and OOG was covering a lot of the remaining costs, simply because having Phobos functional was worth it to them.


[12-Apr-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	It made me curious if most governors were bringing in enough taxes. There is enough work that you all are doing without having to fund the planet out of pocket yourself. 😄

[12-Apr-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	@--schaitr-- is that mostly having to supply COGC?


[12-Apr-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Verdant's taxes were low for a long time based on previous governance of "a gov who has the base set up to produce 100% of COGC and donate it to the planet" ... I attribute this to practically burning out Not Trey.


[12-Apr-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(note: if the game becomes a job, it can become unfun with the slightest push)


[12-Apr-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other major exepenses for Verdant are POPI (which was stock to 100% and slowly burning down - I'm borrowing against the future there) and programs which can be used for short term fixes.  The longer term fix I'll probably have taxes higher, but to do that I don't want to shock the production ... and thus the "be 100% open with the books".


[12-Apr-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	It will be nice when we have parliment's and all the onus of running the planets is not on one person


[12-Apr-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I don't think they'll throw me out if I jack up the taxes ... as long as they can see where the money goes.  I don't want to have "raise taxes" and then have multiple weeks of +100k income that I... for lack of a better phrase "embezzle half a million"


[12-Apr-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheVanquish121**:	God my spelling was bad but you get the idea


[12-Apr-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Real Soon Now (tm).  There's talk of allowing the people running the planet to set "planet will buy at ..." rates.


[12-Apr-24 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So the planet could have a price set to buy RAT for COGC at 95% of RAT.CI1


[12-Apr-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	I think it would to cool also for incentives and being able to give people who contribute to the planets running cost tax discounts and things like that


[12-Apr-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Planet buy rates would be cool. I have a small side business selling POPI upkeep commodities and that would make it easier to find planets looking for supply. As it is right now, I have to find governors interested in buying who aren't already set up with a supply.

**TAfirehawk**:	@Insula_Crisium Since taking over the balance is still bouncing around but taxes cover about 95%, maybe more.  There is a BIG disclaimer on that and it is my costs are KAWA prices, not CX.


[13-Apr-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	If I was paying CX prices then it would be ~600,000 a week out of my pocket if I bought everything.  Of course I make some things myself so not that bad.  I wouldn't have taken over governor at CX prices....would need to ramp up my own production to be able to afford just a few things off CX.


[13-Apr-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NonRedibimus**:	I know someone's been trying to sell GRN for 500 for days now, but to see purchase orders at that price is crazy.

**Finalgamer**:	might be that they are trying to keep a production chain going since it might cause too much disruption otherwise.


[13-Apr-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	It looks like they also bought up all the high price grain buy-orders. There is now no grain for sale


[13-Apr-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I woudl be shocked if 500 dollar grain weren't killer for profit, but maybe if your chain is long enough the marginal value additions eclipse it


[13-Apr-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finalgamer**:	looks like a really great opportunity, sadly i am not very flexible with my FRMs right now


[13-Apr-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	It's amazing more rich players don't corner markets by buying up all the supply


[13-Apr-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I mean, GRN is too readily produced. It's not something you can resell so effectively.


[13-Apr-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Meanwhile, I think what you're describing *did* happen to CAF a few weeks ago.


[13-Apr-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Before March 20th, CAF was like 1k/unit. It's shot up here and at MOR to like 1400.

[13-Apr-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I bought... 500 CAF at 900 a bit ago (that's "only" half a million NCC).  And I'm slowly brewing it to COF.


[13-Apr-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	However, I think that the CAF price going up was more a reaction to the best return for a FP changed from DW to COF.


[13-Apr-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	https://prun.plexucra.de/building/ -- put in "FP" in the field.


[13-Apr-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Insula_Crisium**:	@TAfirehawk Paying KAWA corp prices is a pretty big disclaimer.  KAWA has very low corp prices if I remember correctly.  So that would mean that KAWA is majorly subsizing the cost of running Proxion.


[13-Apr-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Deckss**:	KAWA on top


[14-Apr-24 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	@Insula_Crisium yes KAWA prices are a HUGE deal.  I am not sure it is majorly subsidizing running any planet because the price structure is for every KAWA person for every item.


[14-Apr-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	But as I said, KAWA prices are what balances the Prox budget from what NorseFTX had setup.  If somebody is not producing themselves AND buying from the CX, well taxes would need to go up 200% to 300%.  Hence what "everybody" says that being governor is a big out of pocket cost is right.


[14-Apr-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Although not sure why other governors don't bump up taxes instead of taking a personal hit...doesn't seem like a good economic plan to run a government in debt (don't look at the real world LOL).


[14-Apr-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaendryl**:	any governer who hikes up taxes is likely to get voted out next time, or at least that's what they'd assume. you could go tryhard and make excel sheets with a full balance statement...


[14-Apr-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaendryl**:	but honestly that's pretty sweaty lol


[14-Apr-24 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I mean, I'm not sure I'd even notice if taxes tripled here. Taxes seem so low compared to the margins on every product.


[14-Apr-24 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	If it cost a couple percent more to keep getting the benefits of COGC, who'd vote out a gov over that?


[14-Apr-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	22.5 CIS on a 12x BEA.  About 2 CIS / BEA.CI1 .  90 CIS on 12x HER is 7.5 CIS / HER.CI1


[14-Apr-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Yeah I started here and the low taxes got me spoiled, lol.


[14-Apr-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	God, the one time I buy a some GRN in a hurry I apparently kicked over the apple cart...


[14-Apr-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Technically debt isn't a problem if what you're going into debt for will make more money over its lifespan, bridges for example, but there's nothing a planetary governor can do by going into debt to make more money in the future (it's not like people pack up their bases and move in protest) so yeah


[14-Apr-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Though, you might be able to reduce spending on population infrastructure, though we're not supersaturated on Pioneers we have 40% Settler unemployment (though also low happiness so Pioneers get educated and then realize they don't want to live on an Agri world, loool))


[14-Apr-24 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	But, across two planets I pay just 1.1% in fees relative to my sales, and Vallis increased the fees recently, so... yeah that could be higher


[14-Apr-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	and I mean we're talking 60 NCC for Pioneers compared to the 10 CIS here


[14-Apr-24 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	as a Carbon Farmer should I be looking to build a RIG or an Extractor to gather water?


[14-Apr-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	RIG would be for water, but prox is not the best place to get water really.  Think Etherwind perhaps, or buy it.


[14-Apr-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Taxes this past week were 324k and if that keeps up then it is nicely balanced.  Again at KAWA prices.


[14-Apr-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	NorseFTX may have been getting partial taxes the last 3 weeks as my amount was below 324k those 3 weeks


[14-Apr-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It costs roughly 2x more to have a RIG going for water on Proxion than it costs to buy H2O.CI1


[14-Apr-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(the rig has repairs, workforce ... and that's the right out the pocket... its also space you can't put another FRM)


[14-Apr-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We should have a "welcome" message when a new person builds a base here:  DO NOT USE A RIG FOR H2O


[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	lol


[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	well I appreciate the tip, so no rig


[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Etherwind is the 100% best place for a carbon farmer here.


[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can ship water from Etherwind here, and ship GRN (and HCP and MAI) to Etherwind to burn.  Nice bi-directional trade.


[14-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	so 3rd farm, or second Incinerator first? and I suppose before that I need another Hab


[14-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	buy H2O until you expand to Etherwind


[14-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Have you considered a FP?


[14-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	whats that food processor?


[14-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(base numbers: 1 FRM can supply 2 INC burning just GRN)


[14-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I run FRM and FP here


[14-Apr-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep - add a few BEA and NUT to your FRM mix and you can make your own RAT.


[14-Apr-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Add some more H2O and make your own DW


[14-Apr-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

Guide to being a farmer


[14-Apr-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"No matter what those big wigs say in corporate about “hydrocarbon plants”, grain should be first on the list of things to burn. Those plants are a bit more thirsty than simple grain and if you’re just shoveling them into the incinerator it’s all the same. Now, if you start turning up the temp, then it burns more, and faster and you need those hydrocarbon plants to make it all work right for some reason."


[14-Apr-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	also...


[14-Apr-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	"Now, some of ‘ya may already be chomping at the bit to expand to another base (especially those Proxion farmers after looking at their dry pump rigs and longingly over at Etherwind - I know your pain)."


[14-Apr-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	what happens if I cancel a crop in progress?


[14-Apr-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You get a partial amount (rounded down).


[14-Apr-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I wouldn't cancel it - I'd just queue up grain afterwards.


[14-Apr-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you've got a surplus of HCP sitting in the warehouse, that's not a bad thing for when you switch to faster burns.


[14-Apr-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(when you do HCP+GRN+MAI burns, it takes 3 FRMs to keep 1 INC fed)


[14-Apr-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	well I have BEA at 23% and GRN queued up... so I'll leave that be


[14-Apr-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the tricks to consider - everything can work in dozens more "reasonably"


[14-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I have a 3x order of GRN going ... so it makes 12.  And a 6x order of BEA going... so it makes 12.  And a 1x order of NUT ... which makes 12.


[14-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That way the queue rotates so that I don't overproduce one thing.


[14-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	Hmm, good to know.


[14-Apr-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That also takes about 1 day to do for each of them.  Again, makes it easy to think about.


[14-Apr-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Gotta admit that so far I've just been growing grain and burning that.  Is HCP+GRN+MAI without growing the MAI in a HYF still better than straight burning GRN?


[14-Apr-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its complicated ... higher cost of goods (so lower margins on the C) - but its 3x faster ... so you get more.


[14-Apr-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	how do I recover worker satisfaction?


[14-Apr-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	COF.CI1 and PWO.CI1 are at the top of the list.


[14-Apr-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	4 GRN (12h of FRM time) -> 4 C in 24h


[14-Apr-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	vs...


[14-Apr-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	4 HCP (12h FRM time) + 2 GRN (6h FRM time) + 2 MAI (6h FRM time) -> 4 C in 8h


[14-Apr-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So you could get 12 C in the time it takes to get a 1 ingredient burn to get 4 ... but it costs twice as much to make.


[14-Apr-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But 4x GRN (200 CIS) -> 4x C.CI1 (+400 CIS on each unit) -- well, that's 400 ish profit per unit per day.


[14-Apr-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	4x HCP + 2x GRN + 2x MAI ... lets call that all together 200 each for 1600 CIS in costs... we're still ahead on the 2400 CIS that the C would sell for, but only making 200 profit per unit.


[14-Apr-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But we can do that 3x as often... and so thats 600ish profit in a day... 50% more profit by spending 2x more goods.


[14-Apr-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So if you've got 3 FRMs that can support the 1 INC ... its more money faster.


[14-Apr-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and I may have messed up the math there somewhere ... its late and I did it without any other tooling)


[14-Apr-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	does production get quicker over time? because my 4GRN -> 4C time is 1day 6hrs


[14-Apr-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Experts can get it quite a bit quicker.


[14-Apr-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Makes sense @shagie thanks... I can do the math at some point.  I just started burning GRN since it was very simple to set up.


[14-Apr-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN is the first thing to set up and its a nice easy one that doesn't divert too many resources from the FRMs if you've got FPs there also.


[14-Apr-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I think most plants for burning are running around 250 these days(except GRN which no longer exists here)


[14-Apr-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I use 200 as a ballpark number.  And it varies.  BEA.IC1 vs BEA.NC1 vs BEA.CI1


[14-Apr-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	200 seems like a good number.

**Stbadreturns**:	Burning straight grain is better as you scale up the slow growth of hcp is what limits you from keeping them fed ( I did do some math using hydroponics and your roi get absolutely nuked but can actually make about 10-15k more a day but about triples the base building cost


[15-Apr-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The water ratio changes from 0.5 H2O / HCP in a FRM to 2 H2O / HCP in a HYF.


[15-Apr-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	... and that won't stay there.


[15-Apr-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I'm still surprised anyone was ever willing ot pay the price


[15-Apr-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	400 for GRN is close to the break even for INC.  If you've got an INC that you stock with the CX purchased GRN, you need to keep it running - even if at 0 profits, to not lose money.


[15-Apr-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	But the other two burn crops were untouched


[15-Apr-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The other part is that you may just do a "oops, extra zero"


[15-Apr-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	Maybe GRN is staying high because people are trying to use the gap in availability to force higher prices temporarily


[15-Apr-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vaendryl**:	17k or so. pretty sure mentainance cost - taxes is way way higher so that probably wouldn't be a reason to take it


[16-Apr-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vaendryl**:	oh, and 17 BTA


[16-Apr-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NonRedibimus**:	Are there planets where it is actually a competition?


[16-Apr-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Occasionally.  When Kuben retired from Verdant there was a bit of a contest there.


[16-Apr-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	I suppose to have competition, it would have to be a desirable position


[16-Apr-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NonRedibimus**:	You'd have to actually stand to benefit from being governor, rather than it being a chore for wealthy players to ensure the market can support them


[16-Apr-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A well run planet with a large population can have a bit of excess to it.  I'm sure some starter worlds run a profit for the gov.


[16-Apr-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Small worlds tend to have someone (or a corp) invested in their development with some emotional attachment to it.


[16-Apr-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The large ones aren't so much "new players can't run it" but a "the risks to the game as a whole if someone wants to mess it up are high."

**shagie**:	You can bias it against a given industry.  You could make it unprofitable to have a BMP here by making the taxes on PIO in manufacturing to be very high.  But you can't single out any players.

[22-Apr-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deaddoon**:	ok silly question, in the PMMG settings, it asks for Username and API Key? How do I find this?


[22-Apr-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The API key comes from https://fio.fnar.net/ you ask it to generate one.  The PMMG website or discord has a detailed step by step on setting it up iirc


[22-Apr-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I _think_ that's mostly an artifact of days of old.  PMMG now maintains most of its data locally.  I don't think it needs it unless you're working with others and have inventory querying.


[22-Apr-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deaddoon**:	So how do you do a planet survey when a contract asks for a survey


[22-Apr-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	You fly a ship to the planet, land on the planet, click fulfill on the survey.


[22-Apr-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deaddoon**:	its a beginner contract

**illuineru**:	i know


[22-Apr-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deaddoon**:	do you have to land? if I pick the contract it just brings me to orbit


[22-Apr-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	nearly always u spent as fuel cost to fly there and back is too much.


[22-Apr-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	there is a button in fly menu of the ship for land where u can change destination and slider for fuels


[22-Apr-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deaddoon**:	yup got all that


[22-Apr-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**S.Errinwright**:	At min fuel it has a small margin from what I can tell. It's not great if you need two ships, but I think at the very beginning where one ship is fine I've been running the surveys when it's the best contract avail


[22-Apr-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	max active expert number is 6. max active expert number per industry type is 5. that are hard cap


[24-Apr-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MaxVonP**:	Is that per base? If I was to establish a second base and split the roles between the two, would that give me effectively 12?

[24-Apr-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MaxVonP**:	cool, thank you. But can I set up a second base on the same planet?


[24-Apr-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	nope 1 baseper planet. but u can expand your base with permits up to 3 permit and 1000 area. 1 permit gives 500 area which uses to build base 2nd and 3rd gives 250 area each.


[24-Apr-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	so I can cancel and then order it to return...


[27-Apr-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	I think I'll just pick a different contract this time around...


[27-Apr-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	(discoveres all three contracts are shipping contracts)


[27-Apr-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	yeah but it will use whatever fuel for the current maneuver and then have to come back.  Just be aware that it will take time to land again (if the ship just took off) and use the fuel.  turning around sucks, but depending it could be worth it of course.


[27-Apr-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	heh


[27-Apr-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	oh look a second ship....


[27-Apr-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The best faction contracts are for things you already produce on the planet wher eyou already produce them.  The community concensus seems to be that planetary exploration contracts are almost never worth it.


[27-Apr-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	And if you have an idle ship you can probably make more doing player shipping contracts than planetary exploration.


[27-Apr-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	all three contracts that popped up are the pick something up and take it to Ben Station type, I'm thinking I'll take the one with the 6 day limit so I can send it with my next Carbon Shipment.

[27-Apr-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	@GeneralZ - You have the pricing wrong in your buy posts.  No one is going to sell RAT for 0.55 CIS when the CX bid value is 102.00 CIS per unit. The buy post asks for the total cost not the unit cost so what I think you meant was 22,000 CIS. You can delete these and remake them with the correction. I will sell at least 200 to you, if you do that.

[02-May-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Katoa has less gravity than Proxion. Quick test shows that for a 3k/1k ship it takes 32 STL to get to Katoa orbit and 33 STL to get to Proxion orbit using default fuel.  Why/how was it taking 500 to escape Katoa?


[02-May-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	If he was flying from Katoa all the way to Benton station in sublight, that would be a long and slow trip.


[02-May-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Ah, right Prox -> BEN can be a shorter trip than Katoa -> BEN depending on where planets are.  I was talking just about cost to take off to orbit as that was how I interpreted 'escape from Katoa', but I think you are probably right @papi2caca


[02-May-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nala.cat**:	hi i dont know what i am doing


[06-May-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	welcome.  Yes the start can be a bit confusing.  Feel free to ask questions and check out the tutorial.  Public channels and discord are probably the best places to ask for  help


[06-May-24 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	yeah i joined discord and i got lots and lots of help :)


[06-May-24 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	my main issue right now is that i dont wanna play alone


[06-May-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Friends in discord can help that.  If you want more in game interactions beyond the CX and chat then that requires a pro license.


[06-May-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i'll have no problem buying the license if i get to know nice people in here


[06-May-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	the corporation thing looks interesting


[06-May-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Corporations are like guilds or clans in other games.  I'm sure they all operate a bit differently but this game tends to be extremely cooperative


[06-May-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	There are groups set up to try to promote the prosperity of various regions and/or their own corp to the extent that loans and even grants are quite common


[06-May-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	you have one right?


[06-May-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	whats the deal in this planet?


[06-May-24 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	yeah I'm in KAWA.  Proxion is an agriculture world. I grow stuff that either gets burned in incinerators on another planet or sold to someone who I think turns it into FOD or OLF or something.


[06-May-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i was planning on doing something similar!


[06-May-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	KAWA operates in the BEN region (and also MOR and ANT), the UFO discord has a list of corporations that are recruiting.  I'd definitely suggest checking it out if you want to join one.


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	yeah, but i'd like to keep being in this planet :)


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	this is why i ask to you


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i joined the UFO discord today


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	well eventually you will have bases on a bunch of planets.


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	or at least a few


[06-May-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i hope i can get there


[06-May-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Proxion is a great planet.  Etherwind is a nice counterpart to Proxion since it is a resource extraction world with H20


[06-May-24 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	what should i do now that i have my rig, farmstead and food processor up?


[06-May-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The general advice about making water on Proxion is don't... I mean for now it is ok since you built the rig but buying water from the CX is generally better.  You should do the math for yourself though of course.  Oh also if you haven't checked out prunplanner.org I highly recommend it.


[06-May-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i checked but i dont know how to use it :(


[06-May-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	so many new things


[06-May-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	im having a hard time alone


[06-May-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	It makes planning bases a snap.  For my base here I have I think 11 FRM and however many HB1s to support and a STO


[06-May-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	yeah prunplanner can be a bit intimidating to start, but not really so much more than the game.  It has a help page https://prunplanner.org/help which is a good place to start, but you can also ask questions on discords about that and you'll get help.


[06-May-24 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	There is a PrUn tools discord as well linked from the UFO discord.


[06-May-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	okay i'll check that out!


[06-May-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	thank you


[06-May-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	now i guess my base doesnt make sense


[06-May-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i built the recommendend buildings but ripç


[06-May-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Most people's first base is not ideal, mine has construction, manufacturing, chemistry and resource extractoin but we don't talka bout that :D


[06-May-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Long term though you may want to either build a base to extract water or just buy it off of the CX


[06-May-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Feel free to drop by the KAWA discord.  We're friendly and happy to help answer questions.  But also check out other corps and see what is the best fit for you and how you want to play.


[06-May-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Hi, what is the difference between KAWA corp and KPG (KAWA Proxion Governance) ?


[06-May-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Governors of planets get tax income which they use to buy megayachts and all the booze they can drink..^H^H^H.. to maintain the planet they govern.


[06-May-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	those taxes come in the form of dividends that get paid to the corp


[06-May-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	so a lot of governors have their own corp, but if the corp is named something like KAWA Proxion Governance then it is associated with KAWA corp.  And indeed TAfirehawk is in KAWA, they are just in game in a different corp to deal with the taxes.  It is kind of unfortunate but how the game works.


[06-May-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	corp tags in game are really just that though not much else.

***e4e4e3** joined.*


[06-May-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	so it is just more efficient to be in 1-member corp in order to govern?


[06-May-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	It means that the tax revenue goes to one person so you can tell how much you received and use that money to reinvest/balance out what you owe to the planet and what the planet owes to you.  Running a planet is expensive and my understanding is that there aren't always the best tools to understand how much revenue you are getting so people just make a solo corp to make that easier.


[06-May-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	I'm not a governor but that is my understanding.


[06-May-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Thanks


[06-May-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Starwm042**:	for exploration contracts do you just have to fly up then leave again and that's it?


[06-May-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	fly to the planet, land on it, click fulfill.  Conventional wisdom is that they are generally not worth the hassle unless you are already going to that planet or system anyway.


[06-May-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Starwm042**:	ah, thank you, unfortunately will probably have to do it as the other contracts it offered me are worse


[06-May-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	just reject them all


[06-May-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	question: If I have a warehouse on Proxion it will work same as Storage Facility?


[06-May-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yes and no.  Both store stuff, but your production facilities can only pull from base storage which STO extends.


[06-May-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	STO is very handy so your base doesn't fill up with outputs and can hold more inputs.  I think I have at least one on each of my bases.


[06-May-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Oh I see, so warehouse is for manual use and storage is extension of a base. Still I see some usage for a warehouse here hmm


[06-May-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Thanks


[06-May-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	I've found that having a Warehouse space at your base is useful for storing materials that you don't want sucked up by your pops/prod lines


[06-May-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	it's definitely nice to have

[07-May-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's whack everywhere.  Look at the 30 day chart for GRN.NC1 for example.


[07-May-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	That's even weirder if it's not localized


[07-May-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	Either a major player increased demand, or someone's trying to manipulate prices


[07-May-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	I don't think it could be a supply-side shock


[07-May-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Look at the volume.  Some large buys and the market got destablized.


[07-May-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The volume is remains fairly cosntant.


[07-May-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	GRN.IC1 90 day price chart is also a fun one.


[07-May-24 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Volume over longer periods shows a steady drop on IC1, less volume = more volitity


[07-May-24 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	If you go 180 day with 3 day bars, you can really see it dropping off


[07-May-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	whack


[07-May-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	Is Ben typically a smaller exchange relative to the others, or just for farming?


[07-May-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	IC1 and NC1 seem to be primary in terms of volume


[07-May-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S.Errinwright**:	Thought that could be indicative of importation due to lack of local supply, so idk


[07-May-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Ag products are a weird one.  A fair amount is traded, but nothing like what is consumed in house.  Most people put them right into their own INCs or FP to make a higher value product


[07-May-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	4x GRN.CI1 vs 1x C.CI1


[07-May-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	On paper the GRN is worth more money, but the market is very shallow.  Meanwhile carbon has a lot more orders close to the market value


[07-May-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	RAT.CI1


[07-May-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	And RAT, well, its an even bigger market.  And you get 10x for three inputs


[07-May-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	and whoops above, an INC gives 4 C for 4 GRN, so even more value


[08-May-24 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Steeeev**:	yep, I can buy 4×GRN for 804 CIS and turn that into 4×Carbon and sell it for 2448 CIS in 22.5 short hours. But SSSHHHHH it's a secret.


[08-May-24 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	So grn itself counting the cost to produce everything it turns into is more valuable.


[08-May-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	@streev yeah but I can produce 4 grain for about 112 cis and that number can be made even cheaper if you extract the water(from a place like etherwind )and not buy it from the cx


[08-May-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	There was one exception when I got to sell grain for 500 lol 😂 that make it technically more valuable then carbon but not by much


[08-May-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	plants ara generally cheap to produce and you can swap between types very easly


[08-May-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-May-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-May-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Stbadreturns**:	Eh depends on if we're talking about someone who is new or not


[08-May-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Carbon is simple to understand easy to produce and is at least right now it's profit ratio is right in line for what you expect a starter base to make


[08-May-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	True, however when you start as a new player with Carbon, you do not have experts in resources but agriculture - that's weird


[08-May-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Only thing with carbon sometimes is buyer typically buy 5-20 at a time so it can be slower to move then something like rats


[08-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	That's what you want tho


[08-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Like it's about ratio


[08-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Farms take up a lot of space


[08-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Inc don't


[08-May-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	space is not important in first weeks


[08-May-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	So one farm can provide alot of fuel for inc


[08-May-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Yes, but when you start a new game as a Carbon maker it will be better to make it faster - so resources experts would be better. You will have enough plants for it


[08-May-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah but expansion is important for a few weeks as if you can double your productivity you can double your profit


[08-May-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah but that ratio falls flat very quickly at least in my experience ( as someone who just did the carbon start and now and is still making carbon)


[08-May-24 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Trust me I understand what your saying


[08-May-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	But it took me like 11 days to have more extraction expert's then argi


[08-May-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	I just 'do not believe in Carbon' :)


[08-May-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Seeing what's it's chained to it's effect on the economy is absolutely wild if you look at it


[08-May-24 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	And you need plants for it


[08-May-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah I don't think many people would argue that water is probably the most important resource out there because of that.


[08-May-24 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	For now I just think it is better to sell plants than Carbon


[08-May-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	So that could have a positive effect even if it slower


[08-May-24 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Your market isn't huge but genuinely you be able to sell your product


[08-May-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	And if your able to farm out your world getting a second base once you got money too to ship all them plants to a food industry world / extraction world for burning  would be more effective


[08-May-24 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	But new players are so restricted by capital I would recommend do what makes the most money possible


[08-May-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Shipping :)


[08-May-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Don't get me started on that 😂


[08-May-24 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah I seen someone pull that off


[08-May-24 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	If you can make a circle -> Benten-Etherwind-Giedi-Benten


[08-May-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Nah the money is in cx to cx trading margins


[08-May-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Shipping contracts are a trap lol


[08-May-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Sure, but sometimes there is a good deal


[08-May-24 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah and if again your broke yeah best option but honestly trading is kinda wild as you can make in exxess of over 100 credits ber ton on some lucky trades


[08-May-24 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Vs someone paying 2500 for a full ship where over 1000 of that you will spend in fuel


[08-May-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	thats why I take only good deals


[08-May-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Giedi-Benten, 250t for 9k

**Insula_Crisium**:	As someone who does a lot of CX-CX trading, I'd actually argue trading the spread on the same CX is more profitable for new player, at least if they're fairly active. The shipping delays on inter-CX trading kills its ROI.


[08-May-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	You can quickly double a few thousand credits just buying and selling if you know what you're doing. But I suppose that's more work than launching a ship.

**Muad**:	I am just curious how people handle 10 planets. I know there are some playing 3+ years with 3-4 planets but others have 15+...


[22-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Specialization.  The more things it tries to do, the more difficult it is to manage.


[22-May-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	STOs for storage and getting enough products in there for it to run for a month without needing attention.


[22-May-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For example, I'm going to have issue with DW in 9 days here.  So, I'll also haul down another 200 DDT and probably 4000 water.


[22-May-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	i can imagine 4k water, but 200 DDT is not my pocket..How many ships do you have right now?


[22-May-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	1x 500t.  2x WCB.  1x LCB.  3x 500t in system haulers (XH-594, QQ-001, XG-326)


[22-May-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The ship moving stuff within XH-594 for example means that I only need to do deliveries to XH-594b and then I can move use a ship to move stuff between the planets without tying up an FTL ship.


[22-May-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	oh so thats why there is an option for a ship without FTL engine


[22-May-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It makes it much easier for me to look at all of XG-326 as one thing - and do all my deliveries to Frost (where I've got the most out system exports) and then not tie up a ship with a "move food and oxygen from Frost to Titan" and "move TIO from Bastion a to Titan"


[22-May-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	So the key thing is specialization - i need to think about it. The maximum permits per planets is still 3? 1k area?


[22-May-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  I've got 2 permits here and 3 on Verdant... and 1 on all my other bases.


[22-May-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	According to xit fin, my most profitable base is YI-705c which has a few EXT for HAL, a whole bunch of CHP doing HAL -> CL, and a handful of POL making EPO.


[22-May-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	xit fin?


[22-May-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-May-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-May-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	You can select which ones _don't_ show there also.  You'll also note some tricks that I use.


[22-May-24 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	V➡️ is two characters for "Verdant export screen"


[22-May-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	🟨🟥 is xit burn with all yellow and red things selected.


[22-May-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aahz**:	Very useful to be able to see which base(s) are about to catch fire :D


[22-May-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	xit sheets is another favorite of mine.  Embed google sheets into a panel on a screen.


[22-May-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Insula_Crisium**:	nice, thanks!


[22-May-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You can also put a "launch a buffer with a particular google sheet" into the left sidebar buttons... or use xit list to have a list of google sheets that can be launched from a left sidebar button.


[22-May-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	But can it launch a buffer with... Excel?


[22-May-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Alas, no.  There is no "open arbitrary frame with URL" for me to pass office.com into it.


[22-May-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	We need a PrUn extension that lets one open a browser buffer. 😆


[22-May-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Then we can finally run PrUn inside of PrUn.


[22-May-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh God


[22-May-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The last thing I need is the ability to open spreadsheets inside of PrUn


[22-May-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	XIT PRUN does just that.


[22-May-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But more usefully, xit sheets is quite handy.


[22-May-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	but can you run XIT PRUN inside of an XIT PRUN buffer? PrUncursion?

[22-May-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	What it can't do, however, is run PMMG in a buffer in xit prun.


[22-May-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	That's amusing... is there a good use for XIT PRUN?


[22-May-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Nope.  I think it was more of a proof of concept, though would have to ask PiBoy about that.

[01-Jun-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	It's a slow burn economics game - not something that you play fast.  More idle game than real time.  To that end, weekends tend to be rather quiet.

[01-Jun-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	One of the important things for Proxion is do not build a RIG for water - this is a very dry world.  It will cost you more to set up the rig and run it than it will to fly a ship to Benten station and buy the water.


[01-Jun-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Follow the starter contracts - and make sure you unload both ships.

Even accounting for shipping it from another planet to the CX, fromt he CX to here, and for the other player to profit, this planet is so dry it's too expensive to try and pump water here.

**Tharell**:	Under workforce stats; there are COF 0% 0.6 units / day for me. why is this 0% while DW is 100%?


[07-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I can't speak to what the percentage means, but COF and PWO are both luxury items which increase worker efficiency but aren't required for your production to continue


[07-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	At the very least the 0% means you don't have any in your inventory


[07-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tharell**:	Allright, thanks


[07-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also, welcome :) There's a lot to take in and it can be kinda slow going for the first few days, but it's worth it


[07-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tharell**:	Yea, saw many on the forums say that you should sit down & make your own spreadsheet; i'm just waiting for first production to go through so thought i'd start getting into it


[07-Jun-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Don't forget about the Global and Help chats too, no matter where you ask people are helpful, but those will be more active a lot of the time


[07-Jun-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tharell**:	Ah true


[07-Jun-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I don't use a spreadsheet personally, but I do use PMMG, PrunPlanner, and PrunTooltips (and FIO, but that's more of a background thing). There's lots of tools people have made here: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/community-resources/index.html

**DYSIODE**:	Also, I can't stress enough how helpful Faction Contracts are, just don't worry about survey contracts since they generally cost as much in fuel as they payout. It's also good to do that math to make sure you'll make money. Faction points are effectively worthless


[07-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tharell**:	Ahh, good to know; checking out the sites now.


[07-Jun-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Sometimes, you'll get a exploration contract like "visit Proxion" ... which will be "yea, I'm going there... no problem."

**Bayloon**:	Hello, first time here. How do I determine a price for something I want to sell in the local market. Water, for example. Do I just look it up at a commodity exchange and ask for less than that?


[09-Jun-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Hi. Basicly yes, but that doesnt mean u can profit from it. That u have to calculate yourself.


[09-Jun-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Abd if you use PMMG it will tell you how much per unit on local market orders so you don't have to do the math.


[09-Jun-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	building degradation consumables fuel input materials etc


[09-Jun-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	$VLNS has worked at pinning the price of H2O.CI1 (note bases on KW-688c XG-452b SE-110c and FK-794b ) at 31 credits everywhere.


[09-Jun-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's a baseline for water ... and easy because that's what its gonna be unless someone with a lot of money wants to plan shenanigans in the market.


[09-Jun-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Buying and selling it here, in the LM would be slightly higher since there's shipping involved too.  You could probably bring it in and sell it for 33 locally - and people may buy it here since it means not having to go there.


[09-Jun-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And since no one is producing water here (compare Verdant and Promitor), you're unlikely to be able to buy it for less... since someone has to ship it in.


[09-Jun-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bayloon**:	Oh I thought it would be cheaper to buy locally since the producer doesn't have to ship things to the exchange (guess im not really a real business guy yet lol)


[09-Jun-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bayloon**:	Thanks for your answers!


[09-Jun-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u buy it where is produced. u likely buy it cheaper than CX


[09-Jun-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	In my opinion you sell at the CX bid price or less, because that is what you can sell it for at the CX. Then you try to buy from people doing the same or pay what ever you have to when you are desparate.


[09-Jun-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Taking shipping cost into consideration would only make sense if you buy everything you need locally but since that isn't the case you need to go to the CX any way making fuel and time for shipping irrelevant.

[17-Jun-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

***Joronimo** left.*


[17-Jun-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah sell your carbon at the cx be careful when you start you want to burn minimum fuel as you can end up in a situation where your spending more then your making


[17-Jun-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Trust me, there is always a carbon shortage. You will have no problem selling the stuff. But you are at a disadvantage certainly because the COGC on prox is for agriculture, and INCs are resource extraction buildings. Really, prox isn't a great starter planet if you ask me. It's the only decently fertile planet in the region, which makes it the go to for producing one's own C once you have a couple bases up later in the game. But the fertility isn't great, resources are meh in qutntity. It's a low profit margin start, and will take you a while to get on your feet.


[17-Jun-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'd stick with it if you have a plan and an idea of how you want to play the game. It's about having fun. But if you're looking to expand as fast as you can, manufacturing on katoa is probably your best bet. Or restart on promitor for agriculture.


[17-Jun-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But if you want to stick within the Benten region, Kat manufacturing have very strong returns. And is very easy on the upkeep costs because you can produce half of your inputs including luxuries.


[17-Jun-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	For example. The profit margin on REP (repait kits) on Katoa with your 2 starter experts, the HQ bonus, and COGC, is around 6200 per day per bmp. The input costs are quite prohibitive if you don't make the most of your starting cash. But if you stick with the 2 BMPs and 2 HB1s they recommend at first and resist expanding immediately, you could use all of your remaining starting capital to buy a couple day's worth of inputs for REPs and go from there.


[17-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	BMPs are also very flexible. They have a very very diverse setup of recipes with all different sorts of inputs. If you keep your eye on the CX for deals, you can make serious profits very early on. LST for example is weird on Ben. It will fluctuate between like 60 and 160. But when it's 60, if you can grab a couple hundred of the stuff, you can make MCG for days and make insane profits.


[17-Jun-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm also on Katoa, and would be happy to help you get on your feet.


[17-Jun-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	atm ive got to 2 FRM and 2 INC that balance near perfectly, they're bringing in around 30k per day (without fuel)


[17-Jun-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	im just weighing up future development and if its worth staying here or restarting


[17-Jun-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	What recipes are you using?


[17-Jun-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	HCP, MAI, GRN


[17-Jun-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Like the numbers don't add up.


[17-Jun-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	youre right, i may have misremebered my figure


[17-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i remeber now, it was 30k per inc per batch


[17-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Download PRUNner.


[17-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i worked it out of a batch of 6 runs


[17-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's a good tool for figuring out your inputs/outputs, profits etc


[17-Jun-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i have 8k per day per INC


[17-Jun-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	not including fuel


[17-Jun-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i havent worked out fuel yet


[17-Jun-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	The most you could be making when you calculate in upkeep costs and such is around 11k, and that doesn't inculde fuel costs


[17-Jun-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, a little over 9k per day of REVENUE from the C you sell on the CX


[17-Jun-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But that's not profit.


[17-Jun-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And with current market prices, you're better of producing BEA in your farms, selling it, and buying your inputs.


[17-Jun-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	so i can produce 19.4C per day, total revenue of 13.3k


[17-Jun-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You're missing luxury upkeep then


[17-Jun-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	correct


[17-Jun-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You should make those a priority.


[17-Jun-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	They will speed things up significantly.

**SilentReaper**:	But yea, going the C route on proxion as a starter base it might take a little while to really get to the point where you can just snowball.


[17-Jun-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You could try building a couple EXTs to mine LST. You have two starter ships, and you'll only need one for a little while. You could produce LST, fill up a ship and send it to Antares station for the higher prices.


[17-Jun-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You'd make a decent amount like that.


[17-Jun-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i was actually thinking of going for some LST


[17-Jun-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i could then produce FLX and import silicon and go electronics


[17-Jun-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	2 EXTs would double your daily profits.


[17-Jun-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And one additional HB1 would give you exactly 2 EXTs worth of pops.


[17-Jun-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I wouldn't mix different categories


[17-Jun-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I had the same temptation, but it just simply isn't worth it. You end up making less, a lot less.


[17-Jun-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	would you say its better to specialise bases and transport what you need?


[17-Jun-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yes 100%. At least until later in the game. There are some commodities such as LST that are really really heavy. And to transport in any meaningful quantity will take many many trips with your starter ships.


[17-Jun-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So people will setup chemical plants where they extract LST.


[17-Jun-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delldax**:	i may restart tbf, starting here has let me figure out how to navigate the menus and the simple carbon production chain taught me how it all works.


[17-Jun-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If you look at Asbestos Lead Asbestos to the right of you, just right of Benten, it has a huge LST deposit, but it has a Chemistry COGC.


[17-Jun-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	The reason for that is because it's easier and cheaper to consume the LST on location than it is to make the COGC resource extraction and export the LST somewhere else.


[17-Jun-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. You're not in a great spot with C production on Proxion as your starter base.


[17-Jun-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And like I said, if you start on Katoa as a manufacturing company, I can help you get started.

[17-Jun-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And then as you expand, build on Etherwind.  Add RIGs and move the INCs there.


[17-Jun-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jun-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's possible, and if we all got like 150k up front at the start of the game, it would be very feasible. But Off of 2 FRMs and 2 INCs, even best case scenario you make 10-11k a day with daily costs of inputs over 15k. That means running your ship between BEN and Prox every day basically at the start to make sure your INCs are fed. And if you want to make the inputs for the INCs yourself, you're sacrificing profits which go down to like 7-8k. Building REPs also costs about 15k a day in inputs, but the profit on a single BMP is that of his whole setup as it was.

**shagie**:	One FRM can supply 2 INC running on GRN.


[17-Jun-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If half your capacity is making GRN, the other half of the capacity (allocate 16% of the queue) for BEA / GRN / NUT ... and then you're on your way to a FP.


[17-Jun-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	However, if you were doing a manufacturing start here with LST for MCG ... that gets awkward.


[17-Jun-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A carbon farm start though, it just needs another FRM (3 FRMs total) to pivot.

**Stbadreturns**:	@shagie ehh my math has it just about 3 inc per farm with how prox outputs


[17-Jun-24 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I don't understand how that makes sense. You're saying it's better to run the C recipe that takes 22h WITH all the bonuses including luxuries? He'd be making even less profit per day. I mean sure, he would have next to zero input costs, but he'd also be making like 6500 profit per day, which as I mentioned before, a single BMP can output right now. It's true manufacturing is more reliant on market prices, but I haven't run into a situation where ALL BMP recipes are down on their luck with CX prices. It's just a matter of pivoting and buying whatever is cheap on the CX. And if you use any community tool that tracks CX prices, it's not very hard to do. At least that's been my experience in the short while I've been playing the game.


[17-Jun-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I work from the base numbers there.  1 FRM: GRN(4) is 12h.  1 INC: 4 GRN to 4 C is 24h.  You can make 2x the GRN per day than an INC consumes.


[17-Jun-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Adding in COGC and experts pushes the needle one way.  Moving the GRN to a RE world where you've got INC pushes it another.


[17-Jun-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The thing I was trying to point out was the "That means running your ship between BEN and Prox every day basically at the start to make sure your INCs are fed."


[17-Jun-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	You shouldn't be feeding INC on Proxion from goods on BEN.  Buy some H2O, and let it run for a while with the GRN produced here getting burnt to C.  Shipping every day eats profits fast unless you're also filling up a cargo hold of stuff to sell.

**SilentReaper**:	I agree with you shagie. It wouldn't make sense to keep running between BEN and Prox to keep the INCs fed. But the alternative you laid out simply doesn't make much profit. He can build a base on prox (provided the planet doesn't fill up) a lot sooner starting on Kat than he could a base on Kat starting on Prox if that makes sense. Just as an example.


[18-Jun-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And @Stbadreturns Some BMP goods, yes, but many are upkeep items for T1 and T2 pops. And I have never waited more than a couple hours to sell my REPs or EXOs on Ben at asking price. It's a lot harder to get inputs at asking price than it it selling your outputs. Plus, with INCs and only INCs, your profits will depend entirely on the market price for C, while BMPs can produce like you said a huge variety of intermediate goods. It's more flexible.

[18-Jun-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's true, but even at 1000, between 2 INCs you're making at best 8 C a day, which is 8k. And that's not including upkeep. It's possible, it's just not the best option out there in my opinion.


[18-Jun-24 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Stbadreturns**:	that what my prox does right now


[18-Jun-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Sure. But you've completely maxed the area on your plot with FRMs and INCs. The cost is like 500k on top of whatever you start with if you buy the stuff off the CX.


[18-Jun-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And I wouldn't even disagree that at that scale, using GRN in stead of the quicker recipe is better because you'd be consuming like 400t of inputs every day to feed the INCs. But he had 2 INCs. And at that scale, there's more profit in buying the inputs because the necessary logistics is minimal.

[18-Jun-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jun-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	No I mean if you use the recipe that has GRN, MAI, and HCP, the input tonnage is like 500 actually.


[18-Jun-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	per day


[18-Jun-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	at 19 INCs

**SilentReaper**:	Which is unrealistic


[18-Jun-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But with 2, it only takes 50t per day of inputs to keep the INCs busy. 20 of which he could have produced in his FRMs


[18-Jun-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Stbadreturns**:	It's why you don't use the recipe as if you are not growing hcp in a hydroponic it is way to costly to grow on a farm it why grain is the way u push all grain you can fit more inc and it makes the "one planet " method more efficient and that was you need as a new player as yeah eventually I will not be burning C on prox but a resource ext planets for efficiency


[19-Jun-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	And now there was some ratios I messed with if you expanded prox to 1k space but with just prox and 500 space and not taking the 400% material cost increase to build hydro a newer player just doesn't have the capital to make it effective

[19-Jun-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well. At the end of the day, the difference is maybe 1-2k in profits a day. It's not much. And you may be right that you'd save more just doing GRN and having no input costs and letting your INCs cook. But it is still true though that Manufacturing is more profitable at the start. By a good amount. Not lightyears better, but better. AND prox is not in the same system as the CX. It's offset by the fact that you have no inputs except upkeep. But still makes it an unideal situation for a starting player. And in mfg you can produce your own OVEs and PWOs, which saves money in the short term even and gives you a luxury upkeep item basically for free forever.


[19-Jun-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Are you adding building costs to the equation? eg: BMP need 100PIO, INC 40PIO. each BMP add cost of a HB1 to mix, yet 2.5INC need 1 HB1. also BMP need 12 area yet INC need 10 Area. nad if u add that to mix; each BMP cost you 22 area yet aech INC need 14 area


[19-Jun-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's assuming you don't build the farms as well for the INCs.


[19-Jun-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If you include the farms in the calculation, you're already at 80area for 2FRMs and 2INCs.


[19-Jun-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	assuming u buying materials to run bmps from the CX.


[19-Jun-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You can build like 2HB1s and 5INCs with your starting capital, but then you're back where you started in terms of needing to buy mats at the CX, which was the whole point being made about why it's beginner friendly, just having to use H2O as inputs. Not to mention you're actually making less profit according to PrunPlanner


[19-Jun-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And if you look at the 1FRM to 1INC build, it will cost you more in both area and construction materials to build out 300 pioneers worth of production and you will make less overall.


[19-Jun-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	As of now. If you're using the Ben CX as reference. With 3BMPs, starting HQ bonus, COGC on Kat, the 2 starting experts, and PWOs no COF,  it's 16k profit per day and 8k input costs. OVEs is 10K profit /d on 3BMPS. PTs are 10k. REPs are 17k. OVE into EXO is 9.6k.


[19-Jun-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jun-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	I've got 3 permits on Verdant and 2 permits on Proxion and 1 on Harmonia.  The 2nd permit on Proxion was a lot of hemming and hawing over "should I do it" when HOP.NC1 changed its stable price.


[21-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'm definitely doing the same thing. 3 permits on Verdant is absolutely necessary to keep me going. but I'm limited on ag output and the thought of going any further than harmonia for more bases sounds painful currently


[21-Jun-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Shifting some agri to Bastion c in the Real Soon Now timeframe.


[21-Jun-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

***EnemyCube** deleted this message.*


[21-Jun-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Verdant was my first base so it made sense to go to 3 permits when I needed the capacity. It's also located closest to Sand which is where a lot of the outputs are processed


[21-Jun-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Now I'm branching out to further places but there isn't much fertile land closeby that I am aware of


[21-Jun-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	^ That's likely a common scenario for people too


[21-Jun-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Proxion was super far to me when I set up here but Harmonia makes it look like a walk down the street comparatively. Others are further


[21-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I originally intended to scale back on Verdant but now I think I might just plop a corp HQ there and take full advantage of the permit stacking


[21-Jun-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So you guys would say it is worth it putting more permits on a single base?


[21-Jun-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I've felt the 50% reduction in additional area is a bit too much of a sacrifice.


[21-Jun-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	it does ease your logistic but generally less land -> less building -> less money


[21-Jun-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	it is a sacrifice, but I think it can be worth it. Particularly early on I had excess permits that helped fill in capacity along a certain route. Adding a new base would've been difficult but going taller on an existing one let me fill up ships already moving that direction


[21-Jun-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I'll be reconsidering that more as I get more ships


[21-Jun-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Right. And I suppose you can always tear the buildings down if or when you need the permit somewhere else. Also keep in mind you get a bonus the more unused permits you have.


[21-Jun-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	that's important to consider: all of this stuff is incredibly temporary so you can change as you see fit


[21-Jun-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	as for the bonus: it's nice, but it isn't strictly better than having an entire extra base if you can let supplies flow


[21-Jun-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	early on my ships were idle, and now they move constantly and have become the bottleneck in some cases. So it really depends on your logistics capability


[21-Jun-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Very true. The additional profits outweigh the bonus you get. Although I suppose if one wanted to get extreme, they could focus down a single base, upgrade their HQ to like lvl10, and get a 35% bonus or something on a massive 1000area base. I could actually see the merit in that.


[21-Jun-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I might steal that idea. One of these days I might actually put some production buildings down on a base, lol.


[21-Jun-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	And it would be nice to not have to worry much about logistics and just have one super profitable base.

**DYSIODE**:	That's what I've done with my home planet (Vallis), it spits out most Settler and Technician consumables which I use a tiny fraction of and almost all the components necessary (though without much extra) along with the first two tiers of building prefabs

**SilentReaper**:	Producing O on Prox also isn't the best idea. It will barely make you any profit. If you want to start on proxion, I would recommend building FRMs. But even that will be a somewhat slow start. I had a whole discussion with another individual about the merits of producing carbon with a 2FRM 2INC setup. I was partial to restarting the game doing manufacturing on Katoa as that is more profitable, but a bit more challenging to manage at first. If you do want to keep your start on Proxion though, FRMs producing GRN and using it in Incincerators to produce carbon is stable and requires very few outside inputs from the market. You can then expand to more demanding recipes for carbon which take more inputs, as they do actually turn a better profit, they just require that logistics from the market.


[23-Jun-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	A COL on Proxion is a "I've got an extra 50 PIO and 15 area after all is said and done" rather than a "this is a way to make money."

[25-Jun-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This dry world is also a blessing in that you don't waste space with RIGs on an agri world.  My Harmonia base has 5 RIGs and 5 FPs and 9 FRMs (1 permit).  Proxion (2 permits) has 16 FRMs and a "why is it that big?!" ORC ... and no RIGs.

[25-Jun-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	DDT.NC1 - its not cheap, but it's products appreciate nicely.  The main use is that 1x DDT.NC1 makes 4x HER.NC1 ... and each unit of HER.NC1 can convert 2x RAT.NC1 to 2x FIM.NC1


[25-Jun-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I was able to snag a bunch of DDT for 1700 a long while back and it got me a very nice cash infusion - FIM was at ~2000 at the time. the prices still work out pretty favorably I'd say but it looks like a lot of people jumped at it


[25-Jun-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	for a month or two I stopped producing RAT entirely and just made FIM. I miss that


[25-Jun-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jun-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	I am not into a food industry. I was thinking in future MED production


[25-Jun-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	do my guys die of starvation


[27-Jun-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no, but production efficiency will drop to very low levels


[27-Jun-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	ih okay cool


[27-Jun-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	they'll be on the job, but instead of making stuff, they'll just spend all their time complaining about how the boss never feeds them


[27-Jun-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	how do i get more food?


[27-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	on some planets, you can grown and produce your own food.   proxion is one such planet, because it has good soil fertility.  so you need one a FRM (farm) to grow things  and a FP (food processor) to make food


[27-Jun-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but most people buy their food and drink from the commodity exchange


[27-Jun-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	i see


[27-Jun-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	thank you for the informtion

[27-Jun-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	do i pay a fee to produce stuff/


[27-Jun-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	yes


[27-Jun-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	how do you make money then?


[27-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	who are you selling stuff to


[27-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	Commodity exchanges -> Benten is the closest


[27-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	whenever a production line starts an order, a small fee is automatically paid to the government of the planet


[27-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	the system buys it?


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	you sell it to other people


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	makes sense


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	wheres the currency being generated tho


[27-Jun-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	thats still just cycles within the community


[27-Jun-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you open a buffer with the "CXOB DW.CI1" command, you'll see all the open buy and sell orders for DW (drinking water)


[27-Jun-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	oh ok


[27-Jun-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	some products (like DW) have a market maker, which is a built-in agent in the game that has an infinite supply that it will buy and sell.  but it's very rare for a commodity to trade at these prices


[27-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	trades at ower prices?


[27-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a commodity like DW is very high volume -- lots of people make it, and lots of people buy it.   so 100% of DW trades happen between players


[27-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	i see


[27-Jun-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	thats cool


[27-Jun-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	how do i produce water


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	h2o i mean


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you use a RIG to extract H2O


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	i see


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(and if you want to turn that H2O into DW, you can use a FP food processor)


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	ay have done some things wrong in the beginning


[27-Jun-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Aside - do _not_ build a RIG on Promitor.  This is a very dry planet.  It will cost you more to run the rig than it would be to buy H2O.CI1


[27-Jun-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Had the wrong P in my mind.  Promitor is wet.  Proxion is dry.


[27-Jun-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**illuineru**:	MAT CAF.NC1


[27-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	open a buffer with "MAT CAF" and it will tell you


[27-Jun-24 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	im still learning commands sorz


[27-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DamienXD**:	is there a keytboard shoortcut for buffer creation?


[27-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no worries, asking questions is the best way to learn


[27-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ctrl+space will open a new buffer, but it's very unreliable


[27-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	CTRL+space


[27-Jun-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	HRT (IC1) tends to have more activity on agri and food than NC1.  And Antares can be the right spot for some metal.


[27-Jun-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	HRT is far far away


[27-Jun-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Muad**:	from here of course


[27-Jun-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  Also RAT.IC1 is frequently cheaper than RAT.CI1 -- and so if you're trying to sell it at the best price...


[27-Jun-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As a farmer, this has better margins if lower volume.


[27-Jun-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's also C.NC1 and C.AI1 being more in demand and so a higher price than C.CI1


[27-Jun-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(often, not always)


[27-Jun-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I've realized that the way the markets work here aren't exactly like how markets respond in real life. And I think I know why that is. For instance, there are cases where there is a ton of supply, not much demand, yet the price is higher than at other CXs. And I think it's because there isn't enough volume. If we had 150 bids in stead of maybe a dozen in good cases, there would be more competition. Prices would find a natural equilibrium. As it stands, I think what this game is missing is players.


[27-Jun-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	C.CI1 has some close to bankrupting me more than once

[27-Jun-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	thanks for sharing, loved it


[27-Jun-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	was looking into building a base in Frost for the water, but now I may as well run some INCs whenever I get there in the near future


[27-Jun-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Arguably, its better for INC than for water.  Nearby, XG-452b is a _much_ better water world than Frost is.


[27-Jun-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	oh yeah, liquid water ftw


[27-Jun-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So... I've got this equation.  Its simple, but flawed, but it tells the story its meant to tell.  "How much extraction can you get out of 300 area".  Why 300?  Because that's the least common multiple of the area of COL, RIG, and EXT.  What about habs?  I said it was flawed.  What about COGC and experts ... still flawed.


[27-Jun-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So... A300 for XG-452b-H2O is 1,490.17.  KW-688c-H2O is 1,260.00.  YI-715b-H2O is 1,099.97.  XG-326d-H2O is 741.85


[27-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	UV-796b-H2O is 252.00


[27-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	I think I saw that on one of the discord channels not long ago


[27-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	from you, btw


[27-Jun-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Yep.  I like my A300 number.  Its easy to understand and useful for quick comparisons.

**shagie**:	Unless you're pushing sliders to the right, should have a good bit of fuel for several to Benten and back without refueling.  That said, don't get stuck.  I recommend topping off fuel whenever you get to a CX - just to be sure.


[28-Jun-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the flight computer helpfully tells you the percentage of fuel that you'll burn.  so as long as you burn less than 50% going out, you'll be fine coming back

**marchioro**:	careful with the bean coup


[04-Jul-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Syndel**:	Oh, I see. Thank you. Now that I know, it's a shame that I don't know any of those running. I won't vote if I don't know what their... intentions are.


[04-Jul-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Syndel**:	Can the number of parliament representatives be changed?


[04-Jul-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**marchioro**:	you can bet that whoever is already there is very likely to keep doing what they are already doing... if you are happy about it, just vote for them

**Stbadreturns**:	my opinion is let the governors govern  they done the best in this regards keeping the planets cocg and popi full and running alot of times at there own expense.


[04-Jul-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	if they fuck up... vote them out simple as lol


[04-Jul-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I don't really understand people running and playing politician.  If you don't like what I have been doing then vote me out, otherwise I will keep things rolling without a bunch of new agendas thrown in the mix.


[04-Jul-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	One key thing that we will all see, the planet runs at a significant loss to CX prices.  Most things I get are at a discount to CX prices but I am not sure if anybody here realizes just how far off the taxes are to real costs.


[04-Jul-24 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for most planets, this is the first election since the politics updates, so i'm not surprised to see a bunch of people running.  they're curious to know what it's all about!


[04-Jul-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Finances mixed with personal company stuff made it very hard to separate, but now we can show the true loss in planet government


[04-Jul-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I welcome anybody to join Parliament...but I do have a planet to run here :)

[04-Jul-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	like i have an understanding of how this shit works i would prob be fine as a paralment person but id keep it a stack i just vote yes on whatever our gov wanted loll as he knows what is needed lol


[04-Jul-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	push it though no need for burcratic BS lol


[04-Jul-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I also think that people who were not previously governors do not realize how many extra steps this update adds to the job... don't get me wrong, I love the change so far and think it will be a lot of fun. But running a planet, especially of this size, is a lot of work for no pay. A parliament full of fellow KAWA members will allow TAfirehawk and our governing team to do things more efficiently. If you're running just to have the title next to your name... you're not really helping the planet. In the grand scheme of things, taxes are an extremely tiny part of everyone's company expenses, but governing is a lot of work. If you have any issues I would respectfully invite you to bring those to us and open a diologue instead of running to fill a seat


[04-Jul-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Very well-put


[04-Jul-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	agreed


[04-Jul-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	my only complaint with this new system it went from a 1 gov one vote so you could vote the person you wanted in there, now i have 1 vote but 6 people are getting elected and can only can vote for one person.


[04-Jul-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	feels like i could get to vote positionaly or people should put in weather they are trying to be paralment or gov


[04-Jul-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is the single non-transferable vote model for voting.  Its the easiest to implement on a first past the post system that existed before (and is a generalization of it).


[04-Jul-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Things like STV get... interesting and a _lot_ harder to understand / explain and code.


[04-Jul-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	well yeah its the same voting system we had... just now we have more people to vote for we just well dont get to choose. lol


[04-Jul-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if a planet has a parliament size of N, it would be nice to be able to vote for up to N people


[04-Jul-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	yeah


[04-Jul-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	like i look here.


[04-Jul-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	i understand. trust me the system we have and the system we want  its like running before learning how to stand. but... i can still winge at it when it feels bad lol


[04-Jul-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	and i beleve that you can will this system into a decent place that would feel better and usable that would hold us for for a while lol

Comparison of electoral systems
A major branch of social choice theory is devoted to the comparison of electoral systems, otherwise known as social choice functions. Viewed from the perspective of political science, electoral systems are rules for conducting elections and determining winners from the ballots cast. From the perspective of economics, mathematics, and philosophy,...

**Gravy**:	RE government costs, I've been getting the numbers for biogensis since I just got elected - I was bleeding a lot of money keeping the plant running.  I'm waiting a full period to adjust tax rates, but its not an insignificant cost.


[04-Jul-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Even with internal pricing (and putting aside internal vs CX pricing discussion) running any planet is expensive, let alone a heavy pioneer plant that still has higher tier populations


[04-Jul-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Just running 1/3 of the Proxion SST is 3000 OFF a day, best CX price is 100ea, so $30000 a month (or $1k a day) to run the cheapest of 3 consumables for the cheapest population infrastructure


[04-Jul-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	*3000 OFF a month for the SST

**TAfirehawk**:	CX pricing is nearly 1,000,000 a week on Prox and tax revenue is 320,000


[05-Jul-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	so yeah, KAWA and myself do this at a loss....


[05-Jul-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	and now it is going to take 5X the effort here to do it with Motions in Parliament


[05-Jul-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I will gladly do it and I am helping on other planets....just stating facts and with separate gov and personal finances you all will see it


[05-Jul-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I hope most people understand the current tax level is not sustainable, especially figuring in building upgrades and running programs


[05-Jul-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	hey i know what you all do, ill support you and sing your praises as much as i can


[05-Jul-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Lastly, nobody in KAWA wants to raise taxes to cover CX costs.  But I will say if the KAWA people have majority in parliament then we will be 100% transparent on costs vs. revenue


[05-Jul-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Not looking for praise but thank you :)


[05-Jul-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	not a governor im not tied to any corp. but i seen the numbers most planets run at a lost. when talking CX pricing and from what i know with KAWA there industry is designed to support planets and do so very well imho :)


[05-Jul-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	will you have reguler donatoins from big older players and add that to the transparency?


[05-Jul-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I had a one-time donation from NorseFTX on them leaving, other than that never had any donations


[05-Jul-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	and that was personal money, there is no positive in Prox Government


[05-Jul-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	KAWA does support a lot of planets but at a loss


[05-Jul-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	the sad part in all this is taxes are going to go up everywhere because of this added complexity and then people are going to in turn try and blame the government lol


[05-Jul-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	taxes shouldn't be this low in the first place, if the goal is a balanced government budget.  but real world we see government deficits in the trillions LOL


[05-Jul-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	i know


[05-Jul-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm curious... who has SCI here?


[05-Jul-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I have no idea how far or how long government finances can be negative....but means the government can't afford Programs or Building Upgrades


[05-Jul-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	ooo the goverment can go neg interesting


[05-Jul-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It can't exactly 'go negative' can it? Or  do you just mean broke? :o


[05-Jul-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	There's ~75 SCI running here and several hundred ENG ... would it make sense to increase the taxes on those tiers substantially since they've got the most POPI demand?


[05-Jul-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I have to test it today but from what I saw on Nemesis, it can go in the red :)


[05-Jul-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	kinda neat


[05-Jul-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Go in the red but, you have liquid assets within the government context, can those actually go negative?


[05-Jul-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yes shagie, I think we have to look at all levels as a group so see where to raise taxes


[05-Jul-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Lots to still figure out and that is why I don't want to raise taxes....don't want to touch anything for a few weeks


[05-Jul-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Understood, just don't hesitate too much raising them if it ensures you keep running it the way you have :]


[05-Jul-24 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Well crap


[05-Jul-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I did the pay out for the upkeep I need to move into POPI and it accepted the -140,000 government balance but it won't transmit me the money


[05-Jul-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	So it won't pay out money when "in the red"


[05-Jul-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Oooh, interesting.


[05-Jul-24 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	So no free lunch here


[05-Jul-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	But it will show how fast the planet is behind on tax revenue


[05-Jul-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(You've got four art galleries running? And a cafe? And 3 universities?)


[05-Jul-24 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yeah I turned some things off from what NorseFTX had to lessen upkeep


[05-Jul-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	On Verdant, I've got 6 SST and 4 INF and a PAR running ... and that's it.


[05-Jul-24 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	almost to the point of not running Programs....but may go back since Programs are cheaper.  Can't run Programs with negative balance I dont' think


[05-Jul-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I was running Festival 2 every other week to maintain full population...with all those POPI buildings


[05-Jul-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	some buildings only have 1 of 5 resources


[05-Jul-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	you can see what actual resources are used if you open each building


[05-Jul-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	not saying Prox is setup perfect....just maintaining what i inherited


[05-Jul-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jul-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	with full tanks, you can fly from here to BEN in 3h49 minutes, using 405 SF and 30 FF.   if you instead take half a tank, and you adjust the fuel usage to use the same amounts, it take 3h 47 minutes instead

**shagie**:	One of the notes to consider for new players - the order size makes bigger batches.  It doesn't make things any faster.  Honestly, it makes things slightly slower.  Its useful for managing your queue (e.g. "I'll be away for two days, lets queue things up so that the queue doesn't run empty while I'm away" - or for evening out ratios (I like keeping all agri products in batches of 12) - but it doesn't help make anything faster.

**Papi2Caca**:	Yes Shagie, it took me way too long to figure that out. I was doing everything in the smallest batches, wondering what the advantages/disadvantages to upping the order size were. It seemed to me I should always keep it at the minimum, so that materials were available asap, but as I started growing my agri products, I realized they naturally fit into a ratio of 12 very easily to match growing times if I line the recipes up correctly.


[16-Jul-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Aug-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah I see. Prox isn't a bad planet for that. Once you get a feel for the game, if it's for you, I'd recommend restarting on a planet called Promitor if you want go the food/drinking water route.


[01-Aug-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Couple reasons for that I won't overwhelm you with.


[01-Aug-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Papi2Caca**:	Welcome to Proxion. Farming?


[04-Aug-24 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	My biggest advice I can give new players, the game wants you to build RIGs here. Please don't. There isn't enough water on Proxion. It's cheaper for you to buy it from someone else at Ben CX and ship it here than for you to pump it yourself.


[04-Aug-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**geruetzel**:	thanks for the heads up!


[04-Aug-24 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thog_of_War**:	what you can do in the meantime is start tinkering with spreadsheets so you know what to do in 2 days when your jobs are done :p


[04-Aug-24 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thog_of_War**:	i recommend looking into the daily costs of rations, water, and pants

**digital_dragon**:	New player here... I made 4 carbon and have a ship going to pick up more supplies (I think...). How do I sell this carbon? I can't post because my company isn't the right rating and I can't seem to select "Storage Location" on the orders screen. Anyone got any suggestions or videos?


[08-Aug-24 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	you buy and sell at the cx ben is the closest


[08-Aug-24 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	you have to ship te stuff


[08-Aug-24 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**digital_dragon**:	Oooooh... I have to drop the stuff off at the warehouse there first?

**Stbadreturns**:	So you load your ship with the carbon. Then go to send that ship you loaded yo Ben station put your ftl fuel on minimum and just give it very little stl fuel to where the flight time is reasonable ( realistically anything under 24+ hours is fine )


[08-Aug-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	The reason for this is basically your selling about 2800 cis of mats if you let's say burn there in 4 hours you can burn 6-10k worth of fuel basically making that trip cost you money

**DYSIODE**:	That said, I don't think you have to be too frugal with fuel, if you're doing Faction Contracts when they are available (and aren't survey missions, and generally make you money) you'll probably end up with a good chunk of reserve fuel

**TAfirehawk**:	Government update - the government is running 100k to 150k deficit every week.  I have been personally covering this for a while now but it is time to raise taxes.  We plan to start with SCI and ENG increases so new players are not affected, along with an increase in warehouse rent.


[24-Aug-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Any of us in Parliament can share the income vs. expense details if people would like to know more.


[24-Aug-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We will also be looking into optimizing POPI a bit so there will need to be funds for building upgrades.  Plus the upcoming Gateways will surely be very expensive...so the government really needs to get positive sooner than later.


[24-Aug-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	bring it on!


[24-Aug-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	no reason for you to need to tank those expenses


[24-Aug-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Agreed!


[24-Aug-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	When NorseFTX left, I was given some extra funds to keep things going.  And with GOV changes a month or so ago, it is clear exactly what the balance is


[24-Aug-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	BTW, that 100k to 150k loss every week is buying stuff well below CX prices.


[24-Aug-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	i feel you can raise pio/set taxes too without affecting new players too much, its such a small tax anyways


[24-Aug-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Thankfully KAWA makes most things so we get a discount here :)


[24-Aug-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	2nd step would be to raise PIO/SET taxes....if needed


[24-Aug-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I appreciate the support and I can be very transparent with income vs. expense in the new GOV system.  Any extra income will stay inside the government bank.


[24-Aug-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	extra income = prosperous planet


[24-Aug-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Aug-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	also, supporting high tier populations on large starter planets with tons of pioneers is *extremely* expensive. it's not at all cost effective for upkeep, so it makes sense to tax those populations accordingly.


[25-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Does upkeep increase with the number of workers on the planet?


[25-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	or only the level of the infrastructure buidings?


[25-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	also, don't just compare the new rates here to the old rates here. compare it to other big planets and see how good of a deal you were getting here... these taxes are still low for this circumstance imo


[25-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	the amount of materials needed to fill buildings is just based on the number of buildings. the number of buildings needed is based on the pop


[25-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	so more population adds to building upgrade cost and weekly upkeep cost


[25-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Gotcha.


[25-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ye, looks like katoa has the same fee for eng and sci


[25-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	we already have the buildings, or close to it, for the current population.  We may upgrade here or there to get cheaper weekly upkeep....maybe


[25-Aug-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	just minimum upkeep here is probably over a million weekly at CX prices. then upgrades and programs are extra


[25-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Right. Looks like we have way too many pios and settlers


[25-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I can confirm at CX prices the weekly upkeep with running Festivals is over 1 million / week


[25-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	44% unemployment for settlers


[25-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	with weekly income of 320k


[25-Aug-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	eh, not too many, just enough that it doesn't make much sense to support higher tiers


[25-Aug-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We have extra PIO / SET as I have been experimenting with NOT running Festivals....just didn't work at the higher tiers yet


[25-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Maybe if you let safety and health take a bit of a dive to bring down prices. Bet the planet could spare losing a few PIOs and SETs


[25-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah, with this population balance there's really no way around the excess settler une


[25-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	so still some optimizing but income is roughly 1/3 of expenses if bought at CX.  Thankfully KAWA supports this and many planets are discounted prices


[25-Aug-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Obviously don't want the gov to be running a deficit


[25-Aug-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Gov has been at a deficit for a long time, thankfully NorseFTX left me money to cover but we need to get balanced


[25-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah CX prices for things like SUN and UTS can go through absurd spikes. Better to have a reliable source


[25-Aug-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	NorseFTX was making a lot themselves, but I am buying it


[25-Aug-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	KAWA is a good source but not for everything little thing


[25-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	if the taxes are too much then they can be lowered...any extra money stays in the government account.  Plus we will need to fund Gateways


[25-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ye. Fees are pretty low. I think you could leave T1 where it is so newer players building FRMs don't end up taking a hit. But could up T2 for HYFs and same for T1 resource extraction for INCs.


[25-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm assuming I'm not the only one pumping out C on prox.


[25-Aug-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And if you're at that point, you have some extra to spare to keep the planet functioning.


[25-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yeah, last resort will be to affect new players....we will avoid that as best we can


[25-Aug-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And I welcome all input and ideas....I don't claim to have all the answers :)


[25-Aug-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Planet is almost out of spots though. The pop you have is probably close to how much the planet will have long term as wel


[25-Aug-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aahz**:	Yes, though ideally you want INC buildings on a Resource Extraction planet.


[27-Aug-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkoniaTV**:	I was thinking of producing just to sell


[27-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Yeah, I just mean that matching the planetary CoGC is good to do when possible since you get a 25% efficiency bonus.


[27-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	This is not really explained (well or maybe at all) in the tutorials.


[27-Aug-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkoniaTV**:	Oh, I had no idea


[27-Aug-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Proxion has an Agriculture CoGC, you can see this with pli uv-796b and clicking on Chamber of Global Commerce.  So buildings that match that CoGC get a bonus.  see https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html for details and a list of which building matches what CoGC.

[27-Aug-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkoniaTV**:	oh wow, Thanks for that info


[27-Aug-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, it's true INCs get a bonus from resource extraction COGC, but if you're producing your inputs on the same planet, you also get a bonus on Proxion for agriculture. I haven't run the numbers to see which one is faster, but you can also even things out with experts. Proxion is not a bad planet at all to produce C on. A 500 area base can pump out like 120C without experts. Only downside is that you need hundreds of thousands of CIS worth of MHL to build the hydroponic farms (HYFs).


[27-Aug-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	A new player is not likely to have funds for HYFs or the water and you definiely don't want to extract water on Proxion.


[27-Aug-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You can start with GRN going into INCs. It's a lot slower and takes a while to ramp up. But it's a good start for producing C on prox.


[27-Aug-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	GRN from a FRM.


[27-Aug-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Agree that FRM for GRN and burn the GRN in an INC is nice and simple.  I make a bunch of C that way since I don't want to bother with HYFs


[27-Aug-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well, long term you always watch to switch off the GRN recipe. It's just simply not efficient enough. You can produce 4 times as much using other recipes. It' just a good easy start imo.

**Mrtplank**:	are there any particular goods that KAWA don't provide / lack full provisions that could potentially be sourced locally?


[02-Sep-24 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	When I initially started here a ages ago I did pick up SUN and OFF (Although that was at the start of us building the popi infrastructure)


[02-Sep-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tiuwilo**:	Once I ship some C from here to Katoa, I'll be printing more SUN for sure. I think the issue lies with things like glassware and DEC.


[02-Sep-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I remember DEC being something that was within the realms of possibility for me to produce, there just wasn't a demand for it back then


[02-Sep-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I'll take a look after work to see what the plan would be


[02-Sep-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	TUB would be nice. We're trying to avoid using DEC except for when we need to upgrade building levels like ART


[02-Sep-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	@TAfirehawk would have a better idea since they just rebalanced what's actually needed. There's a lot of materials that can be contributed to POPI that are not actually needed


[02-Sep-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	quoting from a conversation from a few days ago (From TAfirehawk):  > Planet needs extra TUB, GL, HD.  I get some but not all from KAWA....have 3 CX buy orders for those now.


[02-Sep-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	^ I think there may be some updates since then after rebalancing a bit

[02-Sep-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I usually keep the POPI totally full but COGC I let go a few days for people to contribute there.


[02-Sep-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	But if anybody wants to provide any upkeep, as long as it isn't at CX prices, then let me know and (crosses fingers) hopefully the parliament is running positive to pay everyone


[02-Sep-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tiuwilo**:	@Mrtplank Have you considered joining Kawa, for that matter?


[02-Sep-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Deaddoon**:	So how do you find a corporation to join and buy shares of? is there any place to look?


[04-Sep-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Not sure if any corp really uses the "buy shares" feature. Kawa just issues every member that joins the same number of shares so we're all equal.


[04-Sep-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I'd check the UFO discord.

[04-Sep-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Aahz**:	imagine it is TONS of water and you are pumping it from a kind of dry rock like Proxion


[04-Sep-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you should very strongly consider buying H2O instead of pumping it from the ground on proxion.  it will be cheaper to buy it


[04-Sep-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TAfirehawk**:	Revenue hasn't increased this week as expected.  My guess is that a significant number of bases have population not working.  Not raising taxes again just yet, but probably next week.


[06-Sep-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	If you see the current numbers, do you have a detailed view of where the money come from? maybe you're increasing taxes where ppl almost pay nothing already


[06-Sep-24 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	unfortunately not.  governors only see a generic "Revenue from production fees" line in the financial reports.  so you don't see any details like the production building that generated the fee, or the associated population


[06-Sep-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	@Mrtplank- need a PE buyer?  I buy large amounts wholesale, and can decrease your risk over selling on the CX.  I have special deals for newer players as well to help you as you scale up.

[06-Sep-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so you absolutely need the stuff labled "Essential"


[07-Sep-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the other stuff is good to have, especially COF for pioneers.  the bonus you get from that almost always makes up for the cost to buy the COF

**Mrtplank**:	@insula_crisium I'll definitely be in touch!


[07-Sep-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Also,is there a chance thatwe should let the taxes filter through?Anytone who hadproduction queued before the tax rises still paysthe old rates


[07-Sep-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	And I'm sureI'm safe to assume some of the bigger producers run longer lines


[07-Sep-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	While it is possible to queue up a single product run for over a week, that seems odd to me when you just do recurring at base quantity. Taxes can always be lowered if it swings the other way too much.

**q333**:	@eminence32 you forgot clothes and padded clothes


[07-Sep-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Free players might queue up large orders, but I'm not sure what percentage of the player base is purely free to play and would do that. The advantage of recurring orders is substantial.


[07-Sep-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	also basic players


[07-Sep-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	So far we have gotten about 1 day worth of extra revenue when the target is at least 3 days increase, so not close.  Increasing revenue is a slow process as we try not to do anything excessive

[08-Sep-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Sep-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Sep-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Sep-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my sidebar shows a contract where there is no action for me.  i'm waiting on my partner to provision some stuff, and then i have to pick it up.  but i can't pick it up until it's provisions, so there's no real action for me at the moment

**BlueHeeler**:	@alexisz998 - you might find that Nemesis (JS-299a) would support what you want to do. I have a base there that grows stuff, makes food, drinking water and coffee. It has rigs to get the local water and a BMP to create the other consumables. For me it provides consumables for itself and a chain of small bases heading towards Katoa - my milk run. It also produces fuel but requires some supplies from Katoa.


[14-Sep-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	For sure, Nemesis is much more self sufficient. Proxion is more dedicated to shipping water in. It's just too dry to justify building rigs here. Run the numbers and look at your own CoGM vs just buying it on the CX.


[14-Sep-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	My numbers won't make sense for you, I operate on the internal KAWA market. I sell water for 11 CIS each and still make a profit on it.


[14-Sep-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	@alexis998 - if you would like some help to move your base to Nemesis I can help you. I have a large ship that can probably hold everything you have on Proxion and if not I have four more large ships. I also produce prefabs and other building supplies that I would give to for 1 CIS to get you back to where you are currently on Proxion.


[14-Sep-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The only thing that I ask in return is that when you are ready to upgrade or purchase a ship that you come to me for discount ship parts.


[14-Sep-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I should have thought about this a bit. How would I be able to use my ships to move your stuff? Well I guess we would be doing a bunch of shipping contracts so that might be a bit awkward.


[14-Sep-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Still... I am willing to help you if you want to move.

**Alexisz998**:	Okay, thanks a lot for all those informations guys ! And thanks a lot for your proposition @BlueHeeler ! I will look forward to see if it can be a good idea for me. I want to be in the business of making a lot of Carbon, hence why i need a lot of farmstead. Does the rigs for the local you talked about are on the local market of the planet ? I never explored this on my base here at Proxion. Because i would imagine that the water would still have a cost there ?


[16-Sep-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexisz998**:	As for the discounted ship parts i would absolutely agree to help your business, and when my carbon production grow bigger we could even colaborate if you happened to need some carbon at a lower price


[16-Sep-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexisz998**:	But i could also build a second base on Nemesis ? Because my income started to kick in a lot last week and i have half of the necessary materials to build a second outpost


[16-Sep-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Definately build a second base on Nemesis.


[16-Sep-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Sep-24 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexisz998**:	Okay perfect then, and what was the prefab you said you had ? because i would put them in a good use ^^


[16-Sep-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I make prefabs. The offer was to provide cheap prefabs in order to move.


[16-Sep-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexisz998**:	okay, and so not if i do another base


[16-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well if I have lots I will sell for bid price rather than ask price. I made the offer because I though you were trying to meet a goal that was better suited for Nemesis and thought I could help you get that. Because breaking down what you have already build will not fully recover your materials.


[16-Sep-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexisz998**:	yes that's why i'm hesitating to do that, i have 6 farms, 3 food processors, some incinerators and 5 rigs

[16-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackhoveRazgriz**:	I like that


[16-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackhoveRazgriz**:	If I didn't find this fun at least somewhat and want to learn how it works I would have quite and let my account get deleted.


[16-Sep-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so you should know how to be profitable (because if you're not profitable, you'll have no money and then the game's basically over)


[16-Sep-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but as long as your profits are positive, you can play that was for as long as you want :)


[16-Sep-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	play that way*

[16-Sep-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MortalGoose**:	I just finished (?) the tutorial- what should I do now?


[16-Sep-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MortalGoose**:	Should my ships be getting more water or something?


[16-Sep-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@MortalGoose awesome. After the tutorials you should have a good overview of producing goods in production buildings, and the population consumables. Now you can produce a bit, take your products to the market and sell them. With that money, you can expand your business. Or you can try trading goods, or whatever comes to your mind, really. Even playing the faction contracts. You now are equipped with knowledge to make your empire grow :)


[16-Sep-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	This all takes time, and in the meantime, invest into knowing more about the game, check in into the Discord, the community here is awesome.

[18-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you would be able to cut taxes in half if you run the program


[18-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's all


[18-Sep-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	yes


[18-Sep-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I don't understand how the sum wasted could be 1 million per month using both CX rates and KAWA rates when those rates are wildly different.


[18-Sep-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Do the programs take CIS, or items?


[18-Sep-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm being slightly facetious


[18-Sep-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the tl;dr is, the happiness 3 program is highly effective and much cheaper than other popi


[18-Sep-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	resulting in many monies being wasted on popi inputs


[18-Sep-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I see you're also suggesting the Etherwind government cut taxes as well?


[18-Sep-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	That's not doing your case very much credit, tbh.


[18-Sep-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Like, I'm willing to go take a look at this happiness 3 program...


[18-Sep-24 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	But I don't think the Etherwind government can cut taxes very much.


[18-Sep-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	hang on etherwind is funded by an entity isn't it


[18-Sep-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's not straight taxes IIRC


[18-Sep-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well here are the numbers. proxion has 160,000 in daily spend on popi upkeep. you could turn all of that off and run straight 20% fest 3 program, and you would have identical migration metrics


[18-Sep-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the fest3 program costs 20k\day


[18-Sep-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	your chall


[18-Sep-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	your call


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just ran the numbers for etherwind


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it is entirely possible to halve the costs


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	160,000 in CX prices, or KAWA prices?


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I had the 1.5 million from the wrong planet lmao


[18-Sep-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	these are all cx prices


[18-Sep-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I don't have private prices so I can't model them in archiel's sheet


[18-Sep-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Sep-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for 20 grand a week proxion would have net migration and growth of all pop groups


[18-Sep-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	doesn't matter how cheap KAWA is sadly


[18-Sep-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	We don't need net migration though? All of our jobs are currently filled


[18-Sep-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	then don't run the program and the cost is zero


[18-Sep-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or run the 10% program at half the cost


[18-Sep-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Papi2Caca**:	I'm sure the Proxion government will review. I'm already passing it on to them, same on Katoa and everywhere else Kawa rules. Not sure it's right for us. Our internal prices tend to make our product a lot more valuable than our CIS, and our tax rates are pretty low.


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	We use Archiels sheet too, though, so we'll crunch the numbers.


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	many people do


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but why is nobody seeing the bonus of the fest3 program


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's SO much cheaper than funding SST's and INF's


[18-Sep-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Sep-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	education = migration out


[18-Sep-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it balances


[18-Sep-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	even if you pay 1\4th cx prices for all input mats


[18-Sep-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Sep-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Cheapest will depend on the cost of inputs and such, but I think most people either use GRN directly because it is simple or use HCP+GRN+MAI  for the most C per INC.

**BlueHeeler**:	When in doubt vote for the incumbant governor - TAfirehawk


[28-Sep-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We don't campaign or anything so I suppose it is a good question on who to vote for.  I guess after raising taxes you all didn't kick me out so vote for me to keep things running as-is


[28-Sep-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	The government is finally running positive now but I hesitate to lower taxes because the Gateways are going to be so expensive


[28-Sep-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Daily costs are about 38,000 and daily revenue is sitting about 75,000....after I reduced POPI upkeep so may need more Program cost to maintain


[28-Sep-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Good thing about the money surplus is that it stays in the Government and not any company account


[28-Sep-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	Seems that a lot of players that started on Prox have gone inactive and their plots have opened up. Currently 53 open plots. Might not be unreasonable to try and push for higher pop tiers. Attract people to build ORCs and such. Nemesis is the only other planet I can think of that has that kind of infrastructure if I'm not mistaken. Wouldn't be a bad thing to have another.

[01-Oct-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. You'll want to look at Etherwind or Pyrgos for H2O. Etherwind is a lot closer than pyrgos, but those are the two that come to mind for H2O.

**Syndel**:	@Ydir I have 3 Rigs for water. Never had to buy any, but production is a little slow for me. However, I'm only starting out so I'm sure that things will improve eventually.


[01-Oct-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Syndel**:	By the way Daiku - Proxion (UV-796b) has water.


[01-Oct-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	You shouldn't be building rigs and pumping here, some friendly advice.


[01-Oct-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	It's more profitable to buy your water fromt he CX and to build more FRMs on Proxion. There isn't enough water. Your Cost of Goods Manufactured for the Water you're making on Proxion is higher than if you just bought it (usually...)


[01-Oct-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I would recommend a 3rd base on Etherwind to pump your own water.


[01-Oct-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**superbadsounds**:	I tried and tried to make producing water here make sense, but can't. Even 1 rig can reduce profits by as much as 20k a day


[01-Oct-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**superbadsounds**:	depending on what your production is at least


[01-Oct-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	I almost drove myself into bankruptcy trying to corner the market being the largest water producer on Proxion, building 3 RIGs when i started out lol


[01-Oct-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. It's just not worth it.


[01-Oct-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You'll definitely want a base on Etherwind if you plan on consuming any significant amount of H2O


[01-Oct-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Interestingly enough, you can also build INCs there and burn your crops for C.


[01-Oct-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. C is a strong move. You can produce about 130 C on Proxion if you build your FRMs, HYFs, and INC to ratio.


[01-Oct-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	Rations are also really good right now. Think the market is going to keep steadily rising for at least a little longer, too.


[01-Oct-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	just to put some specific numbers on it:  here on proxion, 1 rig will produce 8.4 water per day.  on etherwind, 1 rig will produce 41.7 water per day


[01-Oct-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Could do RATs. But if you want to get into RATs and DW and stuff, I would just put a base on Etherwind for the H2O and another one on KW-602c to place the FPs and HYFs. You'll get more bang for your buck.


[01-Oct-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	^


[01-Oct-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Milliways, KW-602C. They're practically sister planet. KW-602C is just a bit closer to Etherwind.


[01-Oct-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nah. It's great we have 2 food industries COGCs in close proximity to a good H tap. There's like half a dozen different buildings you need to produce cons from T1 to T5 in food industries.


[01-Oct-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my current food and farm base is up at pygros, but i'm pondering if i should keep it at all, or move it over to this part of the world


[01-Oct-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Pyrgos is great. It's just a little out of the way. Personally, I'd use it to make HER. Great fertility. Inputs are next to nothing.


[01-Oct-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And move the HYFs and FPs and such to somewhere around Etherwind.


[01-Oct-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, 10 FPs on pyrgos feels like they're taking up valuable space


[01-Oct-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i think i just need to get over the high travel time


[01-Oct-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	or just get another ship :D


[01-Oct-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'd specialize Pyrgos and just make it so you only have to go out there once every two weeks or something to pickup exports. That's why I was thinking something like HER was a good idea. It's easy to supply enough H2O for months at a time. And the output tonnage is so small you can just let it accumulate for weeks and haul it all out at once.


[01-Oct-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, i've currently got RIGs on pyrgos, and so i only fly out there every 3 or 4 weeks, when i pick up 5000 each of DW/RAT


[01-Oct-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	which actually i need to do now


[01-Oct-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, it's a little inconvenient it's such a good H2O source. Has good fertility, so you want to build Agri buildings. But it has so much H2O you want those RIGs on there as well.


[01-Oct-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If I were to put an additional Permit on a base, Pyrgos wouldn't be a bad place to put one.


[01-Oct-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Pyrgos is looking popular and is my next expansion....to service C on Tacotopia :)


[01-Oct-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You can produce 600C with 4 bases. You need 1 full GRN base plus a little extra from the CX. And you need 2 full HCP/MAI bases. Those 3 bases can feed a C base producing around 600C/d


[01-Oct-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If you can get a couple corp mates to build the agri bases on Tacotopia, you guys'll be set for a while on C haha

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Proxians. FIOC is looking for new members to join us in our endeavors. New players and veterans are welcome alike. We are different from other corps in that we operate based on a gift economy. This means we provide one another with whatever inputs we need for free, which allows us to focus on collaboration and planetary projects versus just making money. We work together on most planets, and set our vision as a group. All voices are welcome. Our goals are vast, and have plenty of room for new players to join us in our adventures. Check out the welcome page on our discord server if you feel FIOC might be for you. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

[17-Oct-24 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yep! There's a few ways, including luxury consumables, experts (that you'll gain over time), your Company HQ and planetary bonuses like a CoGC or a Corp HQ.


[17-Oct-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagmoLP**:	okok


[17-Oct-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	For example Farms will run faster here because of the Agriculture CoGC.


[17-Oct-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagmoLP**:	ok, i chose the Carbonfarmer and the beans are finished in 5h


[17-Oct-24 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I'm not sure if you start with any, but you can buy COF and PWO from the local CX (benten station), PWO is always worth it, COF might be a bit expensive initially.


[17-Oct-24 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**GabriDido**:	how does this game work?


[24-Oct-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	welcome to the game, it can be a little confusing to start :)


[24-Oct-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GabriDido**:	are you davide? I've just finished the tutorial but know I have no idea about how to do


[24-Oct-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GabriDido**:	can you help me?


[24-Oct-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GabriDido**:	where can i find info about?


[24-Oct-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no, my name is not davide


[24-Oct-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	what have you done so far in the game, and what questions do you have?


[24-Oct-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GabriDido**:	i've uploaded the materials and clicked on construct pioneer's habitation


[24-Oct-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, good.  have you built any other buildings yet, like a FRM (farm) ?


[24-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GabriDido**:	2 pioneer habitation, a rig, a core module and basic materials plants


[24-Oct-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Not sure what, if anything, I need to say about me being Governor here, you can see my experience by simply clicking my name.  If you all want a change then I am ok with that, but that will mean Upkeep will no longer be at KAWA prices.


[24-Oct-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	@GabriDido. The game can be a little confusing at first for sure. There are some good tips in the tutorials. Once you get a feel for things, there's nothing wrong with starting over having learned from all the mistakes we all make first starting out. So for now, take it slow, have some fun, and if you want to reset and give it another shot, you can liquidate your company (COLIQ command) and start fresh. Just keep in mind that you can only restart once before you end up having to wait before you can do it again.


[24-Oct-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And always feel free to ask questions in chat like you are doing already. Plenty of people here willing to help.


[24-Oct-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If you're building BMPs, you should consider making MCG. You will make good profits off of it.

**SilentReaper**:	Welcome!


[24-Oct-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Proxion is a great planet. A little less active on the social front than some others.


[24-Oct-24 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But if you ever need help or have questions and such, we're all more than happy to help yout out.

**Z3R0009**:	Hi


[27-Oct-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i wonder what will happen when the resources deplete


[27-Oct-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Death


[27-Oct-24 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	for me yes since i'm one of the people doing it


[27-Oct-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	My crops doing well... irrigation is the future


[27-Oct-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I must begin extracting or getting water immediately


[27-Oct-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i believe water is very expenisve currently


[27-Oct-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	expensive*


[27-Oct-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah, then it is cheaper to simply extract it?


[27-Oct-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	we don't have much water in this system


[27-Oct-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	so maybe


[27-Oct-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	What do you produce?


[27-Oct-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	limestone


[27-Oct-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah because I need BSE and MCG for the rig


[27-Oct-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i do happen to make some bse


[27-Oct-24 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	and mcg


[27-Oct-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Splendid


[27-Oct-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I need 12 BSE and 40 MCG I think


[27-Oct-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i don't have 12 bse but i do have the MCG


[27-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah okay how much you sell it for?


[27-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i can make more bse since i have the buildings for it


[27-Oct-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i can sell it to you for 24.5 each


[27-Oct-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	wait... resources don't deplete... is that gonna be a thing?


[27-Oct-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah that is good price I think


[27-Oct-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	You can post it on local market or?


[27-Oct-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I'm new I don't know how most of this stuff works


[27-Oct-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i'm also kinda new


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	ahh to be new *looks at 1k days* ...


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	WHAT


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	well... my 1k days


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i only have maybe 10 days or so


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I only started this evening


[27-Oct-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	don't click my name... don't let the absense of a clan tag fool you...


[27-Oct-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah that is awesome


[27-Oct-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	How do I buy/sell with other players because I know it's an important aspect?


[27-Oct-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	if your free... you gotta truck it to the cx


[27-Oct-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	if your pro, you can use lm


[27-Oct-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I am free


[27-Oct-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	you can find the cx's on the left side.. labeled cxl


[27-Oct-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Which is closest to Daikoku-Proxion?


[27-Oct-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah thanks


[27-Oct-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	prox is benten


[27-Oct-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	same system i think


[27-Oct-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	benten cx was established 1342 days ago.. shoulda been the time of last reset... lol... so i'm only a few hundred days less than the last reset


[27-Oct-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Yes I checked, it is Benten


[27-Oct-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah this game so cool, can even check your flight status


[27-Oct-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	My ship will arrive by tomorrow morning most likely


[27-Oct-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I need to begin extraction Water so I can keep up the production


[27-Oct-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Carbon is valuable?


[27-Oct-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i can make a local market anouncement to sell the mcg


[27-Oct-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Oh my ship is already off though


[27-Oct-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	there is a local market in UV796


[27-Oct-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	No ship needed?


[27-Oct-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	uv796b


[27-Oct-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	if you're on the same planet probably not


[27-Oct-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah yes I am there


[27-Oct-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	You can post it


[27-Oct-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	so apparently you can't accept ads so we're going to use the global market thingy


[27-Oct-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	the exchange?


[27-Oct-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Yes I already sent a ship there


[27-Oct-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i also need to have my ships come back to base and go back to benten with the resources


[27-Oct-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah that is okay


[27-Oct-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I will see if I find a good deal until you arrive, but from what I saw people sell in bulk only


[27-Oct-24 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Still I saw that Carbon demand is slightly higher than supply, so maybe that will work for me in the end mwahaha


[27-Oct-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	AS A free player... you can't set prices outside the price band just fyi.. as pro you can


[27-Oct-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Oh


[27-Oct-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	What does that mean?


[27-Oct-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I cannot lowball or set it really high up?


[27-Oct-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I also wouldn't start a rig here


[27-Oct-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	the amount of water is miniscule, water prices are also slowly coming back down


[27-Oct-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	If you're making Carbon, you'll more than cover the cost of the water input


[27-Oct-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah okay then I should just buy bulk water at the exchange?


[27-Oct-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	And also, as a carbon farmer how should I progress? Just make more farmsteads and incinerators?


[27-Oct-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i don't know what sets the price band but yeah... there are limits of wha tyou can buy and sell for.. so no one unit at 1 mil cost unless it is normally something that costs 1 mil


[27-Oct-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yeah I would recommend buying water for now. You can look at settling more bases later down the line to produce your own, or expand into other production types


[27-Oct-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Initially I would recommend filling out some more farms and incinerators as carbon is a consistent income generator to be fair


[27-Oct-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Okay, thank you


[27-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Once you've got yourself some capital, the galaxy is at your mercy


[27-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I saw a planet with a lot of water, but it said it was far away from an exchange so that was kind of a dealbreaker


[27-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	As a carbon producer myself, I ended up settling etherwind for water


[27-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	But maybe after more expansion, must play tall for now


[27-Oct-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Etherwind is the one far away from a CXL yes?


[27-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I wanted to settle that, but it was too far


[27-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i'm dong my own thing but you can't compete each of my bases is about 5 mil just to start up without consueables


[27-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	It's a couple of jumps, not that far in the grand scheme of things


[27-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah then that is good


[27-Oct-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	There's loads of efficiency factors to consider when you're planning future expansion


[27-Oct-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	E.G, proxion usualy runs a bonus scheme for 25% more agriculture


[27-Oct-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Etherwind runs 25% more resource extraction


[27-Oct-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	and so on


[27-Oct-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Oh Etherwind is 18 hours away from me


[27-Oct-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	That is not so far yes?


[27-Oct-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	It produces 16 HCP in the time it takes to go from here to there, but I don't know how long it takes to extract water


[27-Oct-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	~ 4-5hours for 9water


[27-Oct-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	without any experts


[27-Oct-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I'd recommend also looking at the different recipes for C


[27-Oct-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Some are more efficient but require more inputs


[27-Oct-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	rather than just sticking with HCP (Again, this happens over the next few weeks as you expand on the planet)


[27-Oct-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah I see I see


[27-Oct-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Thank you


[27-Oct-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	water and c are heavy but good starter industries yeah

**Id10t**:	i mean prox


[27-Oct-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yeah you can't really go wrong with C, there's always a demand


[27-Oct-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	dot mat c... look at all of what i can be used in


[27-Oct-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Maybe I should branch out to produce MAI and GRB too? Shortens time to like 7 hours to produce C


[27-Oct-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	@Z3 have you found prunner yet?


[27-Oct-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Id10t**:	use it... worship it... praise beans


[27-Oct-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	It's a tool to help you plan bases. The bg thing to pay attention with the recipes is that you might overproduce the plants OR underproduce and have your incinerators waiting for inputs


[27-Oct-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	A building sitting empty will still use worker goods


[27-Oct-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Worker goods...


[27-Oct-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I forgot we must take care of the workers


[27-Oct-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	That means I should also but worker goods at the exchange before heading back?


[27-Oct-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Stock up?


[27-Oct-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yes definitely


[27-Oct-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Okay

**Mrtplank**:	DW / RAT / OVE are a must have for your pioneers. PWO / COF are luxury goods that increase their efficiency


[27-Oct-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	PWO is very cheap and you don't need much of it. COF is a bit more expensive but worth it once you've got a bit more overhead


[27-Oct-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	workers are slave labor but yeah... we must keep them alive and mostly in one piece


[27-Oct-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah so for now before I start expanding I should buy the basic goods? Then start acquiring luxury goods as I expand?


[27-Oct-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Where are the beloved mechanical workers when you need them...


[27-Oct-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I would probably still recommend getting some PWO as it's fairly cheap and pays for itself


[27-Oct-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	But yes, make sure you've got a few days worth of goods and water for your crops


[27-Oct-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Prunplanner can help you with that as well

[27-Oct-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I logged in, no idea what's going on


[27-Oct-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Go to planet search first and look for UV-796b (That is proxion)


[27-Oct-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	You can then press + and start planning :)


[27-Oct-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ahhh thank you


[27-Oct-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	From that point, I would probably just have a play around. You can always save it, and then go to management and make a copy of your plan to make changes


[27-Oct-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I'd also click through the various materials and buildings in game just to see what they all do and the production chains


[27-Oct-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	What is COGC?


[27-Oct-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Chamber of Global Commerce


[27-Oct-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	That's a bit of planet infrastructure that lets the government run efficiency plans


[27-Oct-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	And as Carbon Farmer which do I have?


[27-Oct-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Or like the planet


[27-Oct-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	If you open a NEW BFR (bottom left) and type PLI UV-796b you can see all the planet stuff


[27-Oct-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	one of them is the COGC


[27-Oct-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Click it and take a look for yourself :)


[27-Oct-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ahh agriculture


[27-Oct-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	So I see


[27-Oct-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I'm loosing about 6 DW a day


[27-Oct-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Or per production?


[27-Oct-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	600/day anyways


[27-Oct-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	agriculture seems to be big in uv796b


[27-Oct-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	And 800/day from RAT


[27-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	And another 400/day from H2O


[27-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	So it tries to calculate the cost of your inputs, such as water etc


[27-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah there's the profit


[27-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Around 4k/day


[27-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	That is good, yes?


[27-Oct-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Any profit is good news haha


[27-Oct-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah with PWO it goes up 500


[27-Oct-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	that is splendid


[27-Oct-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	with PWO and COF it goes up by 1k


[27-Oct-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yep!


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	At current setup


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	prunplanner assumes 100% building condition so it might be lower or worse profit than you think at times


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Also doesn't include fuel costs as well


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	when i get everything i might make 10k/day


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	If I were to get another incinerator it would go up by 1k


[27-Oct-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ah that is awesome


[27-Oct-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I must use this more often then


[27-Oct-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	It's a tool to assist than to trust and rely on


[27-Oct-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Good to see how much of a resource I leak a day


[27-Oct-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	but i need to make settler homes and a chemical plant first


[27-Oct-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Play around with the various recipes for C, because it also tells you if you're running a deficit of inpute goods on the right


[27-Oct-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Interesting, as I increase FRM the profit increases, however if both FRM and INC increase the profit increases by a smaller margin


[27-Oct-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Don't forget as you add buildings you'll need to add more habitats for the workers


[27-Oct-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	otherwise they aren't efficient again


[27-Oct-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Ahh true


[27-Oct-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	I forgot


[27-Oct-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Oh damn


[27-Oct-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i'm a builder so i build


[27-Oct-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	If I increase every current building by 1 my profit increases significantly


[27-Oct-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Splendid


[27-Oct-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Take a look at the construction card and supply cart on the left side


[27-Oct-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i'm a famer.. though i recnetly upped that game to orcs... probably a bad move


[27-Oct-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Obviously make sure you take off the buildings you already have


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	18k for 10 days of supplies


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	That is good?


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	how do you check that?


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Supply Cart


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Next to Building


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	That's a fair price yes


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	COnstruction Cart


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	With a profit of 47k if all goes well


[27-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Currently I use 10k/day in just workforce supplies and water


[27-Oct-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	oh yeah i have construct next to that


[27-Oct-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Z3R0009**:	Whoa

**Id10t**:	heh z3.. i spend 45k per day on consuemables, 25k for degridation

**Id10t**:	miir last thought... read the handbook in help


[27-Oct-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	it's useful


[27-Oct-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	hey @Mrtplank good to see you here. o7


[27-Oct-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	o7 How's it going


[27-Oct-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Casually running "just in time" logistics since moving my C to etherwind. 1h 37m until the C runs finish, 1hr 4m for the delivery


[27-Oct-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Nice man, I see you're doing well, thats great. Also, with PRO, you have now access to a lot of good deals. Have you visited UFO Discord galactic deals? :)


[27-Oct-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Particularly the 1 million AIC grant to open up a base in Antares region :)


[27-Oct-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	and many others


[27-Oct-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	https://discord.gg/efuaZGRF


[27-Oct-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	if interested o7


[27-Oct-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I do keep an eye on the deals to be fair


[27-Oct-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	nice


[27-Oct-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I've been eyeing up a potential loan to upgrade the starter ships


[27-Oct-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	oh yes!


[27-Oct-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	they made total difference on my logistics when I upgraded them with schaitrs discounts


[27-Oct-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yeah it's definitely on the book as both ships are now essentially locked up in a set rotation


[27-Oct-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	How are things going your end


[27-Oct-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i might move to another system


[27-Oct-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Are you thinking of a different career path?


[27-Oct-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i'm not a carbon farmer


[27-Oct-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Oh!


[27-Oct-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i'm a builder


[27-Oct-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Ahh I see


[27-Oct-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I think Umbra is the local construction starter planet


[27-Oct-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	"local" as in this part of the universe


[27-Oct-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	not as a part of antares?


[27-Oct-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I'm not sure on the other regions


[27-Oct-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	There'll definitlely be other planets in those regions suitable of course! I just don't know them


[27-Oct-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	what's the system's code?


[27-Oct-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	JS-952c is Gibson! 2 jumps away from Benten CX


[27-Oct-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Not sure on the other regions though, might be worth asking in global chat :)


[27-Oct-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i can make 2 bases right?


[27-Oct-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Yes! You start with 2 base permits. You get more when upgrading your HQ


[27-Oct-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	the planet i'm interested in doesn't have a government


[27-Oct-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	That means there's probably a reason nobody lives there. Keep in mind some planets can ahve different pressures / temperatures / types which require additional building materials


[27-Oct-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	oh yeah it has red pressure and red temperature, i know its not a habitable planet


[27-Oct-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	its just that it has silicon on it


[27-Oct-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	a lot of it


[27-Oct-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	also gibson has an agriculture program in 2 days


[27-Oct-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	so i'm not sure what's happening there


[27-Oct-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Construction is winning the vote there


[27-Oct-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Not sure why it's showing agricutlure on the initial screen


[27-Oct-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It's a bug, construction is not winning


[27-Oct-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	If you'll look at the votes, you'll see it


[27-Oct-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	so i should probably not move to gibson


[27-Oct-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Do you want to start as constructor or manufacturer?


[27-Oct-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	i started as constructor


[27-Oct-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	nice, have you read this post? It explores some starter ideas: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/starting-in-antares/

[27-Oct-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	construction is fun and challenging.


[27-Oct-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MIIR**:	this post does not help me but thanks anyways


[27-Oct-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	oh apologize...


[27-Oct-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Today there are three "green" planets with the Construction COGM: BEN Gibson JS-952c, MOR Danakil OT-442b and MOR Libertas XH-594a.


[27-Oct-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	if you don't mind "red" planet status (which makes the base a bit more expensive) you have a broader range of planets to pick for sure.

[27-Oct-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We haven't quite reached the new state of equilibrium with POPI upkeep changes, but I am submitting a tax reduction anyways.  A little relief on PIO and SET that will impact new people in a positive


[27-Oct-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And I really doubt we can get enough cash for Gateways right now anyways....so will cross that bridge when we get there.  Tax revenue is still positive, even with running the occasional program


[27-Oct-24 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Going to run SCI immigration, even though we prefer not having the higher tier workers here for cost reasons

We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs.

[30-Oct-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	Carbon fluctuates, it's good right now but will probably drop again. PG and EPO are pretty solid options though


[05-Nov-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	PG kinda sucks to make and sell just as itself, but you more than 4x it's value if you're turning it into LSEs.


[05-Nov-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	I think it's great but the market doesn't demand making a ton of it


[05-Nov-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but if you need to consume a lot of PG yourself, making it yourself is probably a good idea


[05-Nov-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It says how much it'll use in the table that shows your route


[08-Nov-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It is usually adviced to keep them low, adjusting to when you're planning on visiting the game


[08-Nov-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**B8man**:	how do you go about keeping your workers happy? im assuming through having the necessities such ad DW and Food


[08-Nov-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	DW, RAT and OVE (because apparently they need pants too)


[08-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Also consider buying some PWO, it is cheap and is consumed in small amounts


[08-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	COF is great too, but is more expensive, so you may do it a bit later in


[08-Nov-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	If you need specific amounts, a "Workforce" button of your base will answer that


[08-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TAfirehawk**:	@SilentReaper since you made a big statement about being in parliament, it would be nice if you participated in discussions and votes....


[10-Nov-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Discussions? I've asked to have KAWA put together some chat for the planets it governs so we can better communicate, but so far I've been ignored.


[10-Nov-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Gov cash balance is 3,000,000.  We are continuing to reduce POPI upkeep and run more Programs to make it easier and cheaper.


[10-Nov-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We have reduced taxes a week ago to reduce revenue about 100,000/week...and we may reduce more but things need to settle down for a few weeks


[10-Nov-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And since the election, it's only you, Capi, and myself that have had "discussions" in the government chat.


[10-Nov-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	@SilentReaper please participate in parliament in APEX, there are 4 motions currently and I am contacting everyone that currently isn't voting


[10-Nov-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Just surprising to me with your big, public post about running for parliament


[10-Nov-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And the 2 motions that were 8 days ago that weren't voted on


[10-Nov-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	hey, you made this a public thing, not me


[10-Nov-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but not publicly


[10-Nov-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Uhm, I wasn't trying to do anything. I wasn't unhappy with you as governor, and I wasn't unhappy with KAWA. I decided to run, did not expect to get as many votes as I did, it's literally that simple.


[10-Nov-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I've already talked about this with CptColeslaw.


[10-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Didn't seem that way to me and I never heard from you...so not voting 8 days ago and today kinda ticked me off


[10-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Maybe you guys should chat a bit, because clearly you guys weren't happy with how things went. They reached out to me. ANd I feel like we cleared the air on things.


[10-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	ABSTAIN is a button push on a current vote


[10-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yes it is and it activates as a registered vote, which I can see different than simply not voting


[10-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not voted yet on an open vote would say waiting


[10-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	8 days ago I didn't even know Government had it's own APEX thing. It had been less than a day since the election. Sorry if I wasn't fast enough for you on figuring out how things work.


[10-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I also want to make a shout out to @Frentic and @capi3101 for actively participating


[10-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So how about we cool the temperature a bit.


[10-Nov-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	If this was based on a misunderstanding, I think perhaps we can start fresh.


[10-Nov-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	@Nala.cat is not voting, not sure they see this chat enough so did DM on Discord....so we may need a new person in parliament


[10-Nov-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Saintbad for parliament :D


[10-Nov-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And I've never seen you make this whole voting thing a public debate. But again, looking past it. If you're good, I'm good.


[10-Nov-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Just started today on Nemesis actually....and yes I'm good


[10-Nov-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	People should know who is participating and voting for....as well as a report on finances that I haven't been doing enough


[10-Nov-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	We all can improve for sure, government with more transparency, mps with participation... that's for sure. On my part I dont believe in "hostile takeovers" whatever that may be, but more in having political newcomers from time to time try their luck. Votes win, and whatever is the will of the players, I'll always respect that. And, of course, @TAfirehawk does an amazing job as governor for as long as I can remember playing this game, very reliable and trustworthy. Im honored to be among you guys, including you SilentReaper, welcome to prun politics lol.


[10-Nov-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Likewise. And I could not agree more.


[10-Nov-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	definitely not the welcome I got when I started, lol....though we've since overcome those issues.


[10-Nov-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So wild that even in Prun, you still run into drama every once in a while haha.


[10-Nov-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Like that Capercat guy omg. The stir he caused in Global a week or two ago hahaha


[10-Nov-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(to be clear, happy with the seats I have, just expanding operations, not politically) - as a voter though, just didn't like the impartial call-out


[10-Nov-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	well i never have any issues on any of the planets @TAfirehawk manage even before politics i have always been on his side as he not proved me wrong yet lol.


[10-Nov-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	New people in parliament is all good.  Challenge is that is like 10% of the experience as the Governor really does everything


[10-Nov-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Not sure how others really can "get into" how the government works


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well you started somewhere I'm sure.


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Whole thing is tricky since the upkeep costs are low by KAWA


[10-Nov-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@TAfirehawk  sure, I agree, but since we cannot differentiate in an election what we are running to, how do you stamp it with the " hostile takeover "  tag?


[10-Nov-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yes I did start somewhere and that was with NorseFTX teaching me the ropes and providing cash and mats


[10-Nov-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	lol i became a Governor on my own planet leaned basically everything in 5 mins


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	but i can imigine with 200+ people on a planet is a bit more work lol


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	XD


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	@Frentic many people contacted me about the post SilentReaper started with....it wasn't good


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	?? I'm not sure what you mean.


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	ahhh i see, i didnt see that post


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Making upkeep work, within budget, etc. is a challenge on big planets....and that is where I started LOL


[10-Nov-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm not sure what post you're referring to either?


[10-Nov-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	When you announced running for parliament, many took that as taking over governor and messaged me


[10-Nov-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	We are all good now...but that is why this is in planet chat and not private chat


[10-Nov-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I was a rent-a-governor before and when the new system went live....so got a glimpse of how it worked both ways.....have been studying under a few active folks and reading up....and some trial/error on smaller planets


[10-Nov-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I am "running" 7 planets now, so more than happy to go thru it with anybody


[10-Nov-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Mainly 7 now since others are stepping down


[10-Nov-24 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah I see.


[10-Nov-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	It isn't hard to run a planet, but does take some experience


[10-Nov-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	assets help too


[10-Nov-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Holy smokes is assets the key :)


[10-Nov-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	But thanks to Archiel's spreadsheet and spending hours in it....the number of mats KAWA supplies is going down from 15 to 5 different types.  Being Governor will be easier with these changes


[10-Nov-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	So maybe it would be a good idea to let others in parliament do upkeep for a few weeks and I can show people how to use Archiel's spreadsheet


[10-Nov-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	why is that? optimizing or changing to cx-prices?


[10-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Figured out festivities can replace popi infrastructure upkeep.


[10-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	SilentReaper has a good idea to make a Gov area on KAWA Discord that is public....we can look into that


[10-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I wasn't thinking public. I was thinking private for the Governor and the PMs.


[10-Nov-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Prox has the cash on hand to do some upkeep at CX prices


[10-Nov-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I mean can be public sure.


[10-Nov-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Well public vs. Corp :)


[10-Nov-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Maybe others are doing stuff like this, I just dont' see it


[10-Nov-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Doesn't matter what it is. Just somewhere where the MPs and Governor can keep in touch and commuicate.


[10-Nov-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	electios are too fast paced...


[10-Nov-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	^^


[10-Nov-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	yeah not sure how anybody picks who they vote for :)


[10-Nov-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	so I am hoping to list those people that vote on motions vs. those that don't....on all my planets


[10-Nov-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	well you have 3 weeks to stand on the stump


[10-Nov-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	My name sounds cool to vote for! Thats for sure!


[10-Nov-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	o7 hahaha


[10-Nov-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	A frantic voter... I mean Frentic voter.


[10-Nov-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	hah


[10-Nov-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	200+ votes unaccounted for at the polls - a little grass roots effort is all it would take to step in to the ring


[10-Nov-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. I think most also aren't PRO accounts.


[10-Nov-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I know you need pro to vote for COGC.


[10-Nov-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not sure if that's also the case for parliament.


[10-Nov-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I don't think it takes PRO


[10-Nov-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just a base on planet


[10-Nov-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So then yeah. Turnout is literally like 8% haha


[10-Nov-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I rounded down to account for inactives, etc


[10-Nov-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	True


[10-Nov-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It does seem like planets in the regions have been rapidly depopulating though.


[10-Nov-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Like Kat had +130 plots or something like that. It's now half.


[10-Nov-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Proxion used to be at 12. I remember scrambling to get a CM kit down haha.


[10-Nov-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	haven't been in BEN long enough to notice, just started popping bases up here


[10-Nov-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Now it's at 59 open plots.


[10-Nov-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Wonder if it was just like a huge wave of newer players that came through from a successful ad or something. And most of them just going inactive.


[10-Nov-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	been retooling and decoupling multi-permit bases


[10-Nov-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I think that's a good idea.


[10-Nov-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Make more of your permits.


[10-Nov-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Plus, if I remember correctly. You were doing mostly resource extraction up in MOR space.


[10-Nov-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	What you expand into down here in BEN space?


[10-Nov-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Every few months there is a lot of building bases and then it cycles from new people


[10-Nov-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Also, do you know what happened to Insula?


[10-Nov-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I know you guys were a team at one point. But he literally just fell off the map.


[10-Nov-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	@Zugore ^^


[10-Nov-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Zugore im doing the same, decoupling my multi base permits


[10-Nov-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	re Insula - no clue, just went inactive in both PrUn and Discord.


[10-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	re expansion, I have a contracted agri supplier for my FI base at Avalon who will cease supply in December, so expanding Agri supply operations to support that....also, the gas markets have fizzled.


[10-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Only gas that I can tell is doing well is H.


[10-Nov-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I think that guy that dumped like 65k N on the market kinda screwed things up a bit.


[10-Nov-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Zugore a fumbling market always pushes us to verticalization... i wish i was better at fostering supply markets as lowstrife is.


[10-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Recently i had to go all the way to producing my own DDT. Everything too expensive and/or unreliable.


[10-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I think unless you're that size, you can't do anything like that without teaming up with others.


[10-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	DDT.NC1 DDT.AI1 DDT.CI1


[10-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I still do N - but that's because I use it....but the O and He ops are coming to a close for me. When I initially retooled Verdant to O 5 months ago, my budget required selling it at 100, but oft I could get 115....it's in the 65-80 range now


[10-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Currently a few people in BEN are working on helping stimulate the BEN economy.


[10-Nov-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I've been putting up DW bases for newer players on EW to help with cons a bit.


[10-Nov-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ouch. 65-80 for O?


[10-Nov-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's brutal.


[10-Nov-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so looks like now it's 90-100 again, but selling it in bulk, I usually post at a discount


[10-Nov-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Right.


[10-Nov-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	On my perspective, markets have highs and lows, on low phases stockpile. O is in stockpile phase to me. Just like CL.


[10-Nov-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I should also get out of the cash generation mode and into the stockpile building mode in some respects, but I'm young yet, and still lots of growth ahead


[10-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Are you interested in a base on EW? lol


[10-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	already there


[10-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah great!


[10-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yes, want to donate me one? :P


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Haha. I don't actually sell anything I produce. FIOC trades everything internally.


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Can't afford to give away bases.


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	you cannot sell, i understand... but you can "donate"  hahaha


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I normally setup permit leases with favorable terms.


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	just kidding :D


[10-Nov-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	where do you think the water for this place is coming from, surely not boucher...and I just decoupled Verdant, so no rigs there anymore


[10-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Etherwind.


[10-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Resource Extraction COGC.


[10-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yeah, water i heavily outsource.


[10-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Great H2O tap


[10-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And EFIO sends invites to anyone who wants that 10% production bonus.


[10-Nov-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You can produce like 2400 H2O/d on EW with 33 RIGs.


[10-Nov-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	finally just figured out what looks to be the most water-efficient RAT recipe for FRM's (1-12 NUT:3-4 GRN:6-2 BEA)


[10-Nov-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yup, have 33 rigs at EW, though Boucher is better


[10-Nov-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yield per cycle at EW is 9, boucher is 10


[10-Nov-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	hey zugore thanks for sharing your ratios... this is gold :)


[10-Nov-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Boucher is better.


[10-Nov-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just requires 10 prod slots


[10-Nov-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I do GRApes here tho, yummy WINes from Frentic Industries. Prized WINes given to the best scientists in the Galaxy.


[10-Nov-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Haha. Premium wine.


[10-Nov-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Honestly, the agri cons for higher tiers isn't that complicated or expensive, it's just super high volume. Like FIM, MEA.


[10-Nov-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	The other stuff like WS and PDA are super low volume but omg are the chains crazy if you try and do it all yourself.


[10-Nov-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Luckily, a lot of it overlaps with shipbuilding. So you can kind of do the two in parallel.


[10-Nov-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Just build an extra APF, a couple more software buildings, an MCA, and you're good to go so long as you have a shipbuilding chain built out.


[10-Nov-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	true


[10-Nov-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	def not there yet....


[10-Nov-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. And a lot of the buildings you'd be building don't in and of themselves offer great profit opportunities. Like the stuff they produce is so low volume.


[10-Nov-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's a pretty hefty investment.


[10-Nov-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Until you get the whole thing built out.


[10-Nov-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	SCAs and CLRs I'd say are the two money makers while you wait for the rest to get built.


[10-Nov-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	TRN market on BEN is currently in pain.


[10-Nov-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I think THE money maker while you lay down ANY plan is ... IDC. :)


[10-Nov-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	true, but the startup cost is kinda hefty


[10-Nov-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(without a lease or loan)


[10-Nov-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's on the back-burner for sure, just keeps getting pushed


[10-Nov-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yeah the whole setup takes a ton of cash to setup AND run AND repair.


[10-Nov-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	cons too


[10-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	ppl normally overlooks running/repairing these bases... and yeah its not cheap.


[10-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Personally, I don't see the attraction to IDC bases. Devs have nerfed it recently. PP is like 45 days.


[10-Nov-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And for newer players, like how the heck are you going to pay for repairs when the lease runs out exactly when repairs come due basically.


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And then the consumables on top of that.


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Its not about ROI, its about a safe and reliable infinite cash influx on any currency you wish.


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, that's true.


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Right now im at 3 mill/day revenue at 400k/day costs


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	could easily start small and gradually build it up starting with only a few M, though I like to plan for full build out with 1-mo cons


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But on the flip side, you're producing nothing for the markets.


[10-Nov-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's just cash, which is only as good as the available commodities on the CX.


[10-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm not against it. I'm just not a huge fan of it either.


[10-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Think more emphasis should be on putting more stuff on the CX.


[10-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	oh no, dont think that. my whole empire is not idc... all the subproduced things are sold.


[10-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I didn't think that.


[10-Nov-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And for older players, I think it's a very solid idea.


[10-Nov-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But for newer players, I think it kind of takes the point of the game away.


[10-Nov-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I will gradually move away from IDC for sure, but its a way too good strategy for mid game progress.


[10-Nov-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah I believe it.


[10-Nov-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And it also allows for non currency based playstyles as well. Like FIOC still has to pay taxes on various planet, even though we don't interact with the CX.


[10-Nov-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We have a couple IDC bases to take care of all of that. Plus fill any holes we have in supply chains until we can plug them ourselves.


[10-Nov-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	nice


[10-Nov-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Again, I'm only against making it like a central thing to one's company.


[10-Nov-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	given the cost of cons, that cash is going into the market....just makes cash another commodity....w/o those MM buys there'd be no new money coming into the game other than newbies


[10-Nov-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Also true.


[10-Nov-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I should have one up and running by years' end


[10-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though I may just start with edc


[10-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I will never be against any legal playstyle here. If lots of ppl want to do only IDC? sure, I'll position myself to sell the chain. Actually I did that, since Shrewd was giving loans left and right for ppl to spawn idc bases.. guess what? Frentic got richer. :P


[10-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or half/half I think is the optimal build


[10-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Haha, smart


[10-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yea, SEs don't need T5 pops.


[10-Nov-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Can also go down the NV2 chain. NV2 also has an MM I believe.


[10-Nov-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But in terms of revenue per area, IDC is the best I believe.


[10-Nov-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Among the MM stuffs.


[10-Nov-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	for land area maximization, half/half idc/edc


[10-Nov-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	the true mm secret will be ... drones. thats all i can say. :D haha


[10-Nov-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	D drones have mm?


[10-Nov-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	;) shh


[10-Nov-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	just the planets popi


[10-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	for those that actually buildthem out


[10-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Aaah


[10-Nov-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Bit risky though as if the government just up an decided to make them themselves, you'd be out of business overnight basically.


[10-Nov-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though, I don't keep up with the devlogs and lists


[10-Nov-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	3h till I get my damn pops on LE-137c.


[10-Nov-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ship got there last week 1h before popr, only for me to realize I forgot to bring frickin PSL haha


[10-Nov-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	5 drones have mms :P


[10-Nov-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	SDR.NC1, SRD.NC1, RED.NC1, CCD.NC1 and SUD.NC1


[10-Nov-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Uuuh, interesting.


[10-Nov-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not an easy chain though. Need LI, ECAs, SCAs, CLRs, DRS.


[10-Nov-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Like the whole shebang.


[10-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not to mention the PHFs.


[10-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	never easy to have easy money.


[10-Nov-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. But actually looks like fun.


[10-Nov-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Have most of the infrastructure already built out. All except the PHFs and DRS.


[10-Nov-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	explore a bit but i believe whoever relies on mms will be better off long-time on drones over idc, mainly because the influence of whos asking for these changes and being heard over the years ;)


[10-Nov-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	longe-term*


[10-Nov-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well. If you want to make serious money on drones, you need serious volume. The SAR cost alone would be wild.


[10-Nov-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	ah crap typos everywhere lol


[10-Nov-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I'll write a forum post on it


[10-Nov-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	and i need a better post on how to scale up with IDC from nothing to greatness.


[10-Nov-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Would be interesting to see people go into drones.


[10-Nov-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Plus, would be cool if someone really captured the entire drone market. Sold the stuff to governments.


[10-Nov-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	my post spooks ppl because the price tag for that strategy was 64M lol


[10-Nov-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No one can buy anything from you here if you don't have a rating. You'll have to sell stuff at the CX.


[22-Nov-24 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Csaszarcsaba**:	Ahh damn, thanks for informing me, I thought I could make a contract or something


[22-Nov-24 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Mrtplank**:	How's your neck of the woods?


[22-Nov-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I've always eyed Nemesis - how do you like it? 👀


[22-Nov-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Frentic - 135m equity in-game or XIT? Either way that's great :o


[22-Nov-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	xit fin


[22-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	My base on nemsis is going well, just maxed out the initial 500 area


[22-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	You definitely did it quicker than me @Frentic :]


[22-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Bit more chat there than most


[22-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	@Mrtplank how did you use it? Mostly FRMs or a mix of stuff?


[22-Nov-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	well, to be fair, i got pro at day 3 and leveraged myself hard at the beginning.


[22-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	did the "capitalist maximalist" path early on lol, now i slowed down the thirst for roi lol


[22-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I mean, that's very fair


[22-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I did a whole lotta shipping when I started


[22-Nov-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Just FRM's, 13x FRM, 7x HB1 and 1x STO


[22-Nov-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	That'd be my base plan too haha


[22-Nov-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	3x HCP, 3x HCP, 3x GRN, 1x MAI ratio


[22-Nov-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yeah


[22-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Im at HQ level 18 (19 permits) and from now on is just suffering.


[22-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Crikey


[22-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Next level is 26 for me, I believe


[22-Nov-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeahh, when you get into just the afab upgrades it hurts a bit 😄


[22-Nov-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	But I've finally managed to start pushing myself mostly outta politics - now I'll be able to force myself to focus on production again


[22-Nov-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	true, politics / managing planets takes time and resources...


[22-Nov-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It was definitely the time aspect that got to me - one or two planets I can do, but trying to juggle too many populations and stuff...you easily let some stuff slip


[22-Nov-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Do you think there should be more delegation to the parliament?


[22-Nov-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	As they kind of just yes/no/abstain mostly right, there's no actual features there?


[22-Nov-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I definitely think it'd be nice if some planets or groups actually divided the work and stuff for planets


[22-Nov-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Delegating and managing is a work in itself... if you have a large number of bases PLUS a large number of planets to manage, you can think of each planet as 1 base to look at.


[22-Nov-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Instead of, for the most part, the Governor still mostly doing the lifting


[22-Nov-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Lets say you delegate feeding the population infrastructure to the parlament... you will still need to check if someone did it or not, to then pay them, etc.


[22-Nov-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	and elections happens too fast imo


[22-Nov-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	organizing new parlaments is another effort... in my humble opinion thats why most governors do the whole thing while parliament is there to help the gov not miss something...


[22-Nov-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	(or cover gov absense, like in Umbra, iirc, one time)


[22-Nov-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	Longer sessions would be good then, provided there's a way to call an election early via parliament motion


[22-Nov-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Yeah, I feel like it's mostly just for the position


[22-Nov-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Example: Verdant's governor once went inactive, the parliament didn't notice until the population started dipping


[22-Nov-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It'd be funny to see people actually try political movements or something in this, though it's hard to beat 'I make a lot of money so I'll fund this planet out of my wallet.'

**Frentic**:	well, it's a capitalist game after all ... every cent matters so if anyone is willing to pay for the planet or bring the costs down, like KAWA does, i support them for sure :)


[22-Nov-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	but i dont intend to be governor... just to help in parliament thats why i present myself in elections. im very active here, i know the drills and i keep an eye on all popis to help govs, vote swiftly on all motions...


[22-Nov-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Nov-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	unless you built your own like some govs have too


[22-Nov-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	No idea....but a real pain in the butt.  I had it reasonably balanced at 120 population but now it is messy


[07-Dec-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Unless whoever's doing it can explain why, I think jacking the taxes up substantially makes a lot of sense.


[07-Dec-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	taxes already 500 for ENG and 1000 for SCI


[07-Dec-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm inclined to say that if it isn't covering the upkeep and a little excess for those populations, it isn't high enough.


[07-Dec-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I can't even come up with a use for those populations that wouldn't leave a huge chunk of the base cross-COGC at best (but then it's entirely possible I'm not thinking of something).


[07-Dec-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-24 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	That being said, scientist upkeep (according to government officials) is costing us more than what they are putting in, and that balance should change


[09-Dec-24 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Csaszarcsaba**:	Which Carbon production template is the most worth when considering both time, and resources consumed? I've just been rocking the 4HCP 2MAI 2GRN one because it's so much faster. I have an excel in which I calculate some things, but I can't really weight how much time is worth in the grand scale of things.


[09-Dec-24 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Csaszarcsaba**:	Like sure I can calculate upkeep costs for my workforce, but profits far outweight the workforce upkeep, but even then just considering that how much faster I can progress, even if the profits are less, it seems worth. On the otherhand I feel like it's just a noob bait, since it uses so much plants.


[09-Dec-24 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Csaszarcsaba**:	I calculated  profit/hour on each production template, and the 4HCP 2MAI 2GRN is the best in these terms, but is this really a good metric?

[09-Dec-24 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	So the best way to understand it is to understand the cost of your inputs


[09-Dec-24 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	And understand the cost vs what else could it be


[09-Dec-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	So let's just say it's all frm and then from there figuring out how many frm's do I need to produce what I need. Then understanding that those frm's are all basically a cost .


[09-Dec-24 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Then you can compare that to what is or is at the time the most profitable output of said frm's because that could also be considered "loss" profits


[09-Dec-24 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Or you can get really deep and figure out if frm's  are even worth it would I better be suited as hyf or some other agri population allowing of coarse


[09-Dec-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ive thought about what an ORC centered base would look like.


[09-Dec-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Haven't done the full math tho, cant figure it rn too


[09-Dec-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Considering the fact you prob don't want multiple planets doing ORC, it might be worth considering a full 3 permits


[09-Dec-24 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Well, you can fit 7 ORC's on a 1000 area base with a bit of room to spare


[09-Dec-24 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Can't fit much else apart from either 1 FRM, 2 HYF, or a couple STO's.


[09-Dec-24 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Seems a bit wasteful considering how few ORC's are really needed

**atlantisrising169**:	At that point it is _meant_ to make an over production. 7ORC is 840a. Minimum hab is 4HB2 and 1HBC(A:65) but your short 15Set. Either 1HB2 1HB1 1FRM 1FER 1HYF(A:92); leaves you A:3, Set:5, Pio:10 . Or 1HBB 1HB1 3HYF (A:69); leaves you A:27, Pio 55. Just enough space for either an INC or a FP, neither perfectly optimized. I personally prefer the first one since it processes some of the ORC output onsite

**Frentic**:	Interestingly ORCs are a different building where 2 500 permit bases gives you 6 orcs, where a 2 permit base gives you 7.


[09-Dec-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Hm. Didn't consider that, I figured it might be better to consolidate planets instead of have multiple, but that's a fair point to bring up


[09-Dec-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Because yeah, permit usage it a valid thing to consider


[09-Dec-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	But also, 3ORC 2HB2 1HBC (plus CM and STO) is 431 area, leaving you A:69, Set: 65, Tech: 55. Decent space, but wasting Tech potential without going out of CoCG

**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	How does a base lease work?


[10-Dec-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	However you and the other party decide to make it work. Whoever holds the permit still owns all the structures and whatnot, they're just leasing out the production capacity.


[10-Dec-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm in a couple cooperatives that essentially leases a couple permits. I built them out to a specified plan, produce the specified goods, and handle inputs & outputs with 0 credit contracts.


[10-Dec-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	generally base leases are a partnership between an old player with lots of cash and a new player with cheap permits.   it costs 1 permit to set-up a new base, and the cost of a permit goes up with each permit you already have


[10-Dec-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so a base lease program involves the richer player paying the newer player to set-up a base to make a specific thing, in exchange for the outputs of that base


[11-Dec-24 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah so basically that or can be like a guaranteed money contract where I buy your output for a set value Everytime and that can equate to x profit per day guaranteed

**Nicster**:	After a long hiatus i came back to the game and decided to start a little loan service as well. The Benten is the BEST New Player Loan program offers already a lot, but i would like to help players even after that.   My offering is the following:  Stable and Interest Loans 3% interest rate 3 - 8 weeks duration min. Loan 200k max Loan (negoatiable, depending on expansion plan and currently available funds on my side)  If you are interested you can drop me an ingame message (CO STMI) and we can discuss ticket size and duration.  see also ⁠galactic-deals on the UFO discrod for a little more information.

**atlantisrising169**:	Friendly question for anyone who has a full base here: What are your daily inputs looking like? Like how much H2O/DDT/NS do you go through _in a day_?


[28-Dec-24 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	"full base" is ambiguous - I have a full 1-permit FRM base (12 FRM) - 600 PIO - 43 water/day


[28-Dec-24 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I mean sure ambigous, but you got like 3 options for permit sizes, and any of those would of answered my question


[28-Dec-24 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Prunplanner will give you a better estimate for whatever build you're looking at.


[28-Dec-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I only use non-fertile worlds for HYF


[28-Dec-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I loathe Prunplanner. I pen and paper this game. Also, that does not address the question at all


[28-Dec-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Fair point Zug. I am currently running 5 HYF here and am just curious on what everyone else's daily costs look like


[28-Dec-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(I also did not expect to be the only person answering the question, so was just providing one perspective)


[28-Dec-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	All good, just getting a feel. My current problem in this game is logistical, I am havnig problems moving all the things I need to move in the time I would like to move them with my starter ships, but I don't have the funds for 1-2 months for a 2k/2k ship


[28-Dec-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	LM shipping is helpful


[28-Dec-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My one HYF base - 1-permit, 20 HYF, consumes 300ns 2100h2o per day


[28-Dec-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If you check Etherwind (KW-688c) has open contracts if anyone is interested :^)


[28-Dec-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Honestly I just need to borrow a 2k/2k for like 2 round trips. I have over 20kH2O I want moved but can only do it in 2.5k intervals mysefl


[28-Dec-24 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Have you considered the option of pursuing Schaitr's WCB deal?


[28-Dec-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	^highly recommended


[28-Dec-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	LCB's come later


[28-Dec-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I have thought about it but currently am under a loan I need to get out of first, and I don't usually move stuff over 2:1 t/m^3 ratio to justify a 3k/1k ship


[28-Dec-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I've thought about converting one of my ships though, just to get some sort of releif


[28-Dec-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Even if you aren't hauling high mass goods, it is by far the cheapest way to expand your shipping capacity, and would still double it.


[28-Dec-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	converting from 2 starters to 2 wcb quadruples your haul capacity for 2M


[28-Dec-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Fair. I owe 2.12M in 11 days, otherwise I would put more gas to that idea


[28-Dec-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Restricted by volume it only doubles. 1K combined to 2K.


[28-Dec-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Oof. Yeah, that'll put a dent in plans.


[28-Dec-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	math


[28-Dec-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Currently sitting on .7M, but it's just frustrating to wait


[28-Dec-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	In fairness though, wait would of been much rougher had I had not taken the loan and did it all myself


[28-Dec-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Fair. Well, I just commissioned a 2k/2k, but it's heading to move water at Boucher, so I'm of no use here.


[28-Dec-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I appreciate the thought none the less o7


[28-Dec-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	mine in the area is also moving water from etherwind to proxion atm


[28-Dec-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	..Could I interest you in a 15CIS/t shipping contract to move a full 2k/2k worth of water for me?


[28-Dec-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	So like 30KCIS for a single (full) hual?


[28-Dec-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it hits prox in @13h...but is free after after that,  then 15h back to etherwind


[28-Dec-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Oh I don't mind the wait, I just wanted to make sure I had somebody lined up before I posted the LM order. Or would a direct contract work better for you?


[28-Dec-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you might consider a different strat with respect to your use of LM shipping - post ads at BEN for Etherwind to BEN, then from BEN to Proxion - broader audience


[28-Dec-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I would be paying double in normal shipping to do that though


[28-Dec-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	true, but your stuff will move faster/more reliably (I also sent you a cont)


[28-Dec-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	The only reason I would consider doing 15/t is because I would be able to get 8 of my normal shipments done in a single contract, which is worth a premuim


[28-Dec-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	standard 3-d shipping rate is 10/t


[28-Dec-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you bump it up to 12/t it gets grabbed faster


[28-Dec-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Good to know, I was under the understanding it was 5, my apologies


[28-Dec-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	GOOD SIR, your kindness is truly saintlike


[28-Dec-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ik you sent the contract, but are you sure you are okay with that?


[28-Dec-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yup


[28-Dec-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Well. you truly have jumped me up at least a week in my projections, I am truly thankful


[28-Dec-24 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-24 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jan-25 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blarbus**:	It was a faction thing


[10-Jan-25 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blarbus**:	what did I do wrong?


[10-Jan-25 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**superbadsounds**:	If the "FUFILL" button wasn't available for provisioning the H2O you had an insufficient amount in the specified inventory. Maybe you needed to unload your ship, or you sent it to the wrong place? Maybe you didn't send enough. It's hard to say without more detail. How much were you supposed to deliver? Where did it need to be picked up?


[10-Jan-25 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blarbus**:	If I understand correctly, I think it may just be an issue where I missed the window to click the FULFILL button on the screen


[10-Jan-25 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blarbus**:	I guess it timed out or something


[10-Jan-25 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-25 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the faction ones are a bit like that, yes.  they won't always be profitable, so it's worth reviewing them before accepting


[24-Jan-25 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	note that if you have a pro or basic license, you can get contracts from other players, too


[24-Jan-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Delta2662**:	nice. still gotta decide if i like the game or not before i give it money


[24-Jan-25 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Other planets, or the CX if you are willing to buy it from someone else's efforts


[24-Jan-25 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	to be clear, you'll be buying most of your stuff from the commodity exchange (CX)


[24-Jan-25 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**kmws**:	scale up your operations I guess, keep your pioneers happy in terms of neccesities, travel back and forth to CX. Think which way you would like to go in the future, but this is underwhelming a bit because there is a lot you can do. See whether this games bores you or not :D


[27-Jan-25 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kmws**:	if you enjoy min-maxing excel formulas I guess it's fun. I think late-game can be also a bit social if you choose politics, but I guess you still have to get there first


[27-Jan-25 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kmws**:	I'd say in the beginning the most important thing is to keep your ships low on fuel usage because that's costly, other than that you will have a lot of time to think. Do the standard contracts that you receive from the game, but learn soon whether they pay well or not. Additionally, there's no combat in the game for now, so you can even pause for a few days and nothing bad should happen. Maybe if you eat all your cash or something, so have a buffer, just like irl lol


[27-Jan-25 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kmws**:	the advice with the Discord is kinda weak because in the beginning you don't know what you don't know, so it's hard to ask questions about something you don't know lol

**Stbadreturns**:	Best advice I have is look what your doing. Where in prox so we got access to farms you don't "need to" but my recommendation would be build out the whole base in whatever your starting kit had you go with typically here it's ether your making food or making carbon typically. Spend your money first on making sure you got everything you need to keep running the rest put into building more production.


[27-Jan-25 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Your biggest early game hurdle is money.

**ManjiTec_Ka**:	Hi, does anyone know if a Free license player can upgrade ships?


[23-Feb-25 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I believe you can, but acquiring the parts will be challenging and super expensive since you're limited to the CX

**CptColeslaw**:	negative. only pro license can start any shipyard projects


[23-Feb-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	true enough, just double-checked....my bad. Just figured since it doesn't require a contract it should be accessible.


[23-Feb-25 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	free license also can only have 2 ships flying at a time i think


[23-Feb-25 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	handbook should cover it if you open it and search


[23-Feb-25 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	since free cannot do SY, they're limited to two ships period - the "two ship flying" rule is for basic

[23-Feb-25 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Technically incorrect, with gifting of licenses you can now be gifted enough time to start shipyard projects and even upgrade your hq a bunch, before being bumped back to free after your gift expires


[23-Feb-25 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	This could also be done with the PRO codes you get from the support tiers, but that had a higher buy in cost to do, so was less utilized

**Zugore**:	gifting and codes still require the action of another player though, and once the free player has accessed the code, they're no longer "free" - but their limitations return once they expire.


[24-Feb-25 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	They wouldn't lose the ships or the bases though 🤷‍♀️


[24-Feb-25 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DeSynchronised.v0**:	they're all quite similar formulas, after looking them up. i think resistors in parallel and reduced mass in the two body problem might be the closest matches to what i was thinking of, but i'm not sure if i've actually learned about the two body problem properly in the past. then again, it's a simple expression, and probably has use cases in physics everywhere...i was thinking from a more mathematical perspective, and the original question was to do with flow rates. thanks for the help, maybe this rings some different bells?


[27-Feb-25 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	What do you mean by flowrates? I did some math gymnastics on it, and could tell you some properties, but idk if they line up with what you are asking

[19-Mar-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Ah, anything I can do while my things are producing?


[19-Mar-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and if your production lines up with the planet's CoGC (chamber of commerce - in this case agriculture) that grants an additional 25% efficiency modifier....


[19-Mar-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	I am in carbon.


[19-Mar-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	read the wiki, handbook, etc...explore the interface...plan/price out your next steps.


[19-Mar-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Thanks.


[19-Mar-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	C (burning) is resource extraction....but if your growing the stuff to burn, thats agri


[19-Mar-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	eventually you would maximize agri here, and move your INC off world to a resource extration planet


[19-Mar-25 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	Spreadsheets, lots of spreadsheets. :)


[19-Mar-25 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	always feel free to ask questions if/when you get stumped - apex global help channel has a broader audience


[19-Mar-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	I spend more time planning, and figuring out what my next expansion will be then activly in game.


[19-Mar-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	that changes the bigger you get


[19-Mar-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	True true.


[19-Mar-25 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Thank you! What is a production order, is that an order yo your production lines or something else?


[19-Mar-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	every time I start to design a spreadsheet, by the time I'm done, stuff has changed


[19-Mar-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes an order in your production in your base


[19-Mar-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	What do I do with money?


[19-Mar-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	buy stuff at the cx


[19-Mar-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	^game money


[19-Mar-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	What is stuff to buy or should I save up for now?


[19-Mar-25 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	provisions for your workers (RAT, DW, OVE, PWO, COF) or inputs for your INC, or H2O for your farms....or save until you need those things


[19-Mar-25 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	What is COF


[19-Mar-25 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	And what do I do with ships?


[19-Mar-25 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	also be sure not to run out of money - every time a new production order starts you get charged a fee - so always keep cash on hand


[19-Mar-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Ok


[19-Mar-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	COF - caffeinated infusion - aka coffee


[19-Mar-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	What does it do?


[19-Mar-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's a luxury consumable for PIO - it increases PIO efficiency by 12%


[19-Mar-25 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Thanks


[19-Mar-25 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you open your New Order tab in your production screen, at the top you'll see all the efficiency modifiers affecting your production


[19-Mar-25 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	gtg, tthanks


[19-Mar-25 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	PWO will increase it 9% - both together along with rat, dw, and ove will bring PIO efficiency to 100%


[19-Mar-25 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	note that the modifiers are multipliers (not added)


[19-Mar-25 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	eventually, you'll have to deal with building degradation (maintenance)


[19-Mar-25 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but not for a couple months


[19-Mar-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Which extange has pwo?


[19-Mar-25 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	back to ships, cx is not on your planet, it's in orbit in the system - so when you buy stuff there, you have to go pick it up


[19-Mar-25 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	same for when you're ready to sell your production


[19-Mar-25 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	hopefully you're using BENTEN Exchange?


[19-Mar-25 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	I don't know whith one to use, if you say benten is good, I can use it.


[19-Mar-25 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	benten is closest to you - if you do not have a ship or warehouse at the CX purchases will be in your contracts


[19-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	If you build multiple farmsteads or incinerators, will production time go down, or will you just produce more at same time>


[19-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and benten uses the currency that's indigenous to your region


[19-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	more at the same time


[19-Mar-25 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Oh...


[19-Mar-25 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	each building adds a production slot


[19-Mar-25 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Should I build more by buying parts, or wait?


[19-Mar-25 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	at this early point, always price things out before jumping in...plan, calculate, confirm, recalculate....money is tight early on


[19-Mar-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	gotta run for a bit


[19-Mar-25 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Ok, this game is complex. I like it, though it might take some getting used to.


[19-Mar-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	What is Apex?


[19-Mar-25 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	I bout water at benten, how do I get it? I sent a ship, is that how?


[19-Mar-25 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	Apex is a name for the Games UI.


[19-Mar-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	If you bought goods the the BEN CX then yeah, you will need to send a ship there to pick up the goods.


[19-Mar-25 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Adiklafa**:	You should have an Inventory screen where you can simply drag the goods between inventories

[19-Mar-25 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Adiklafa**:	Right


[19-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Adiklafa**:	I forgot about that scenario


[19-Mar-25 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	contract can be fulfilled once the ship is at the station


[19-Mar-25 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Ah, thanks


[19-Mar-25 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Ship eta is 7h


[19-Mar-25 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	This is a very slow game


[19-Mar-25 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Will it ever speed up?


[19-Mar-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The ships and production do not speed up.  However, as you get more bases and ships then there is more to do.


[19-Mar-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Mar-25 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	you can't answer that with yes or no, if you grow most of the consumables for your workers yourself then even on proxion the mining of water is worthwhile, otherwise you have to calculate for yourself whether the purchase of materials is still worthwhile, a good tool is https://prunplanner.org/login

[20-Mar-25 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	generally the answer is:  if the cost to extract H2O yourself is greater than the cost of buying H2O from CX, it's more cost-effective to buy from the CX


[20-Mar-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-25 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	faction points are mostly meaningless


[21-Mar-25 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but if you were planning on upgrading your HQ anyway, you might as well accept the contract


[21-Mar-25 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	I am a new player, never played before, I just thought upgrading hq would be helpful later on.


[21-Mar-25 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for sure!  each HQ upgrade gives you 1 more permit, which you can use to expand a current base (up to 1000 area max) or to start a new base on another planet


[21-Mar-25 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since your company is only 2 days old, i think i'd recommend that you skip the contract.  you probably don't have the cash to buy the upgrade materials, and your current cash is better spent expanding your current base


[21-Mar-25 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Oh, well I bought the stuff already.


[21-Mar-25 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-25 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	I heard etherwind is good, maby make another base there in a couple weeks?


[21-Mar-25 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, a common pairing is farming on proxion and then incinerating on etherwind/tacotopia


[21-Mar-25 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Well, that is my new plan.


[21-Mar-25 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	How do you build another base?


[21-Mar-25 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	from the PLI window for a planet, there will be a "Start Base" button you can click


[21-Mar-25 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this should be a link that will open the PLI window for etherwind ----> KW-688c


[21-Mar-25 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Thanks!


[21-Mar-25 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**masterplayer1323**:	Carbon seems very inprofitable.


[21-Mar-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i haven't personally run the numbers on carbon, but at the current trading prices, it should be profitable


[21-Mar-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i can help look at the numbers later, but i'm heading into the office and going offline for a few hours now


[21-Mar-25 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lizard_1234**:	Ya, so needing chem to make CL, and the DDT and there not being a lot of chem planets with the needed techs available makes it a smaller production.  Now everyone needs MEA to feed their scientists, so we have our current issue.


[24-Mar-25 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, DDT isn't a "starter-base" kinda thing.  but a self-contained extration and chem base on griffonstone can make about 28 DDT per day

[25-Mar-25 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	H2O.CI1 getting a little high, yeah?


[25-Mar-25 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Oh wait, another order must of been put in


[25-Mar-25 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	nvm, less then a thousand, wont last the day. Whats up with 42? And I'm kinda surprised H2O doesn't have a MM for selling


[25-Mar-25 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there's actually very few market makers, only for 10 products


[25-Mar-25 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	ig I figured water would be one of them, oh well


[25-Mar-25 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	as far as i can tell, the only MMs are for essential PIO consumables and basic building materials, to ensure that you can always keep PIO working and you can always build/repair basic PIO buildings


[25-Mar-25 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oh, and fuel of course


[25-Mar-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	IDC.CI1, EDC.CI1, CBL.CI1, CBM.CI1, CBS.CI1


[25-Mar-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	to name a few


[25-Mar-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Those the buy ones?


[25-Mar-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep, but they're also MMs


[25-Mar-25 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oh yes, there are many other buying MMs.  but i think there's only 10 selling MMs.

**atlantisrising169**:	Fellow farmers and produce makers of the like. I am here to tell you that I am soon to renovate a local planet (UV-796f) into a Food Industry planet in about a month. I give this warning out to anyone looking to maybe streamline their bases a little more than heading to Milliways or Sonos for your Food Industry needs. Cheers, have a good day


[27-Mar-25 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Worth noting is that UV-796c is also an Agr planet (for HYF obviously), so this would align very well for people able to afford the payments for the bases

**RedBusinessMan**:	hi


[04-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the game has a bit of depth to it, so it's hard for us to give you tips out of the blue


[04-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but please ask if you have any questions!


[04-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RedBusinessMan**:	i am a Victualler


[04-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	start with the tutorials, lots of waiting time at the beginning so explore the interface, check out the discord, wiki, etc. Then it's easier for you to ask specific questions and for us to dial you in


[04-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	got it


[04-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's a slow game by design, but painfully so it seems at the beginning


[04-Apr-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it gets busier


[04-Apr-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-25 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Use the community to learn about the game, plan ahead by creatin some base plans, if you look you could get a loan to boost your starting process.

**RedBusinessMan**:	like in the market


[05-Apr-25 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Sure? I feel I do not understand the context here


[05-Apr-25 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Yeah, all materials (usually called mats) are able to be sold


[05-Apr-25 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	i am not asking you to sell them to me, or me to you. i just wanted to know if this game allows you to sell GRN and BEA.


[05-Apr-25 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	or any ingrediant


[05-Apr-25 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**atlantisrising169**:	Have you completed the tutorials yet?


[05-Apr-25 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	yes


[05-Apr-25 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	One of them should have a thing about the CX, that's the main place things are bought and sold


[05-Apr-25 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ours is CX.CI1


[05-Apr-25 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	i have a ship loded with GRN and BEA. so i didn't want to end up getting there and not being able to sell my stuff


[05-Apr-25 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	oh, ok ok. I see that bit of context I needed


[05-Apr-25 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	and yes, i saw that tutorial on the CX


[05-Apr-25 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Okay so when you go to sell something by clicking the relevant item and hitting the trade button, you can chose how much and for how much you want to sell a good


[05-Apr-25 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	got it


[05-Apr-25 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	From there, you can see the order book by clicking the `Orders` button from the cx buffer


[05-Apr-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	i bought 1 ration on the market. first time buying on the market.


[05-Apr-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	just started playing last night


[05-Apr-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Red numbers are sell orders, people who have already made the good and is ready to be picked up if you pay the price they have set


[05-Apr-25 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Greens are buyers, people who have put money down to buy the good, if someone wanted to sell to them at their stated price


[05-Apr-25 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	oh, didn't know that, thought it was the price that the sellers wanted to sell at. (the red numbers)


[05-Apr-25 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Red numbers are what the seller wants to sell the good at, correct


[05-Apr-25 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	the green than is what a seller is willing to pay for that product?


[05-Apr-25 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Take the GRN order book (CXOB GRN.CI1 in a buffer). Orbital is selling 60 GRN at a rate of 319CIS/u


[05-Apr-25 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Green are buyers, they are offering money for people to sell them the good

[05-Apr-25 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Starting professions do not mean as much as the intro to the game suggests


[05-Apr-25 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	It really just gives you different starter materials


[05-Apr-25 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	wait! you can change your profesion?


[05-Apr-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	In the game I run multiple bases that touch a variety of industries. I started as a fuel refiner on Katoa, by the CX


[05-Apr-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Yeah, you would need to restart your game though


[05-Apr-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedBusinessMan**:	okay


[05-Apr-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

**atlantisrising169**:	Hello fellow farmer, and other agriculturally inclined individuals. On 3/27 I stated I would be starting up a nearby planet, UV-796f, within the coming time. Well this is an update on the matter: i had a minor setback to upgrade my logistical capabilities, but i am back on track and should have the planet up in running in about 3-4 weeks. I would liked to start sooner to be on track with my original guesstimate of a month from 3/27, but i am so far finding this solo so it'll take a bit more time. As a reminder, it is intended as Food Industry world, to try to streamline logistics and help the BEN area with its FP pipeline issues (high RAT/DW/FIM/MEA needs). I hope you all have a good day, and to maybe see some of yall over there when it is all set up

[15-Apr-25 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I settled KW-358b and KW-358c back in the day to establish our own regional metals capabilities. It was hard work!


[15-Apr-25 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	💙


[15-Apr-25 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I use both of those planets


[15-Apr-25 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Well there you go!


[15-Apr-25 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I think it'll be good for the region. My only concern is people coming in and stealing the CoCG to like Resource Extraction (ie INCinerator base)


[15-Apr-25 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Then again, they have BioGenesis who can do the exact same thing for the same cost (as in cost in mats)


[15-Apr-25 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Still a worry though


[15-Apr-25 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Was always a concern but it's a bit short sighted to do that


[15-Apr-25 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	since it's naturally so high


[15-Apr-25 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	its so mch better as metallurgy


[15-Apr-25 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	No no, i mean the planet i am making, UV-796f


[15-Apr-25 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ohhh


[15-Apr-25 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	to come and extract AMM?


[15-Apr-25 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	To turn this planets (and the planet next door UV-796c) directly into C within thr same system


[15-Apr-25 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	oh


[15-Apr-25 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Nooooo, into a INC base like i said


[15-Apr-25 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Sorry, I understand now


[15-Apr-25 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	You're all good, just clearing misunderstanding


[15-Apr-25 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'll come setup there and vote Food


[15-Apr-25 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	(one day)


[15-Apr-25 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	But in the note, yeah i think Giedi Prime (KW-358b) should be Respurce Extraction, with Metallurgy on KW-358c (i have my setup like this, and im tootaaalllly unbiased)


[15-Apr-25 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	/s


[15-Apr-25 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	hahaha


[15-Apr-25 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	it should be metallurgy on both imo


[15-Apr-25 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	you build you AL pipeline on Giedi, and FE on Charlie


[15-Apr-25 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And then absolutely vomit processed metals back to the CX so everyone else can benefit with just PP1/PP2


[15-Apr-25 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	FS/WEL etc


[15-Apr-25 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Or do it yourself on Gibson


[15-Apr-25 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Or as I did, on Katoa.


[15-Apr-25 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It was against the COGC, but there was such a shortage of local materials like that it was very lucrative


[15-Apr-25 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Disagree, Giedi is the only local "Good" ALO tap, so itd be better to pull as muxh ore as possible (RE CoCG) and then to process them on seperate planets (as Metallurgy isnt dependent on the resource being on planet like extracting it is)


[15-Apr-25 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	See, you were my concern ;)


[15-Apr-25 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Especially if you look up the local map for the system (MS KW-358), you would see that a/b/c of that system are VERY close distance wise, and d isnt that far away. Drop an STL ship and let it manage that systems needs


[15-Apr-25 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	How am I a concern?


[15-Apr-25 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Also neke, if you are interested in joining me on the new planet UV-796f, i might ve able to guve you a loan on materials, depends on where i will be in 3-4 weeks


[15-Apr-25 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I have my next few bases planned before I get there sorry


[15-Apr-25 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	will be a while


[15-Apr-25 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Is all good. This offer goes to anyone else reading this too. Depending on where I'll be at that time, i might be able to support anywhere from 0-4 low to no interest loans for people who want to join that planet but may not have the materials on hand to make that jump

[15-Apr-25 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	@Stbadreturns would you be willing to sell those at a discounted rate, for a good cause 👀🤤


[15-Apr-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	I would say I'm the cheapest in the universe with any real stock I made them under 4k when I started they were 5-6 k each I think I done a great service to make it more affordable to branch out to more hostile planets


[15-Apr-25 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Sadly the universe is a bit speratic and there is very few planets that are worth the increase in upkeep from a Goldilocks planet


[15-Apr-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	It's not every case but for some materials the best planet in the universe is a Goldilocks planet


[15-Apr-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	I feel for balance it shouldn't be that way but /shrug


[15-Apr-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Your highest yields should be from the worst planets 😂


[15-Apr-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Make it worth the increase in materials cost


[15-Apr-25 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it is like that for some elements, N for example yields higher on gaseous planets


[15-Apr-25 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(and some other gases presumably)


[15-Apr-25 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	though I realize there's a great random factor when it comes to resource distribution and concentrations


[15-Apr-25 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	H as well indeed


[15-Apr-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Yeah but I like to see in the future maybe some cool shit where like a super hot planet can harvest from like a "iron lake" and make bars at a better  yield then smelting "ore"


[15-Apr-25 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	likely after the great reset (dirty word) - when planetary exploration becomes a thing


[15-Apr-25 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	you'll buy almost everything you need from a commodity exchange.  the closest exchange is at Benten station


[25-Apr-25 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	open a new buffer with the "CX CI1" command to see everything you can buy and sell there


[25-Apr-25 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hazmat659**:	ok thanks for the help

[28-Apr-25 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Good thing I bought all that when I did, but I'm down to like 20d for some bases and that is cutting it close considering how long the DDT to KOM pipeline is

[29-Apr-25 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	@MrPoncho Es gibt Unterstützung für die Sprachlokalisierung in diesem Spiel, aber ich weiß nicht, wo sie zu finden ist! Bitte geh zum offiziellen Discord und frage nach. Es gibt dort eine deutsche Spielerbasis, die dir weiterhelfen kann. (Übersetzt von Google, ich entschuldige mich für die Ungenauigkeit)


[29-Apr-25 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	😅


[29-Apr-25 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well done atlantisrising!


[29-Apr-25 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Google did that heavy lifting, just passing along the message 🤷


[29-Apr-25 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I was trying to do the same but my Google foo sucks.


[29-Apr-25 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	thx, i can talk english too, but not that good, so i see the main language is english here :D


[29-Apr-25 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	legit the only thing I use Google for, aside from other people's excel/word documents


[29-Apr-25 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	... as everywhere


[29-Apr-25 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I mean, I technically use brave. which I think uses Google servers, but still, I try to avoid getting the 10ft pole I use to touch Google on principle


[29-Apr-25 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yes, english here. Don't worry if it isn't perfect.


[29-Apr-25 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i start as a food producer, and im exited to play such a economy game


[29-Apr-25 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Be patient and build up your resourses. It is a slow game, so relax and take it skow.


[29-Apr-25 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I'm pretty sure there is ways to change the language in the game, but yes English is the main communicated language. there are discuss that specifically tailor to certain languages, such as in the official discord which has specific channels just for German speaking players


[29-Apr-25 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Ask for help when you need to.


[29-Apr-25 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i love this kind of game


[29-Apr-25 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Apr-25 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MrPoncho**:	oh i accidentialy close a window. in the Base tab the second in the upper half next to the planet info, which is the comannd to open it again?


[29-Apr-25 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	it was the solar system or so


[29-Apr-25 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	MS UV-796 maybe?


[29-Apr-25 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	also language settings are in the top right (mouse over your username) if you want them


[29-Apr-25 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	Thx Tec_Ka


[29-Apr-25 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	No problem


[29-Apr-25 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	how can i find the nearest exchange? i know, the tutorial will lead me, but the next step is in 5h. so, my pioneers need some coffee and i will do research for later. i find some exchanges, but i cant located them


[30-Apr-25 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	If you open MU NAV (or press the MAP button on the left of your screen) the CXs are where the hexagon signs are


[30-Apr-25 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	Nearest one is Benten (CX CI1), 1 jump away


[30-Apr-25 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManjiTec_Ka**:	COF is optional though, and it's quite expensive so I dunno if it's worth buying. I've never used it myself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[30-Apr-25 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	It usually is


[30-Apr-25 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But in the early stages, the benefit might not be worth the investment.


[30-Apr-25 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	The cost is pretty high for a beginner, compared to the extra profits that are made with it.


[30-Apr-25 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	thx, bs starting


[30-Apr-25 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	thanks, I am a farmer and can produce COF by myself with the Hydro Farm, I will follow as an initial strategy to make this myself. for this I need a community module for settlers and technicians and the Hydro Farm


[30-Apr-25 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	so then i have upscaled my production efficity and can deal with it. hope it make sense

**atlantisrising169**:	Fellow raisers of the GRN and BEA and HER, I come once again to update you about the development of our neighboring planet, and what good news I bring! I am on track, and in about a week I will be able to drop base and get the planet up and running! With this in mind, I would like to remind anyone interested that I am willing to foster/loan out base mats to help grow population. The loan/charge will only be to pay back materials for the base, as I know INS and AEF are not readily available. I do not support inputs, and it will be assumed you are using Food Industry buildings. I haven't hammered out the total cost for such a loan, but reach out if you are interested


[01-May-25 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Also worth noting, I am charging a discount from CX prices for INS and AEF, so do not feel that you are just buying from the cx through me, I process NE from market with in house PG and have in house source of (limited) INS. Currently I can support the development of 1 other person on the planet, but if more are interested I can look into sourcing more


[01-May-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	UV-796f, forgot to mention that. Its in this system, and I will eventually have a dedicated either 3k/1k or 2k/2k stl ship for regular transport in system with here (UV-796b) and our HYF neighbor UV-796c
