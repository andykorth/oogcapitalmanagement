@namthorn What are you currently producing on Griffonstone?


[17-Jan-22 04:24 PM] namthorn#0000
just getting set up atm waiting for settlers to come in. plan was to do a mix of whatever had a market on the CX chemicals wise and do a bit of EPO on the side


[17-Jan-22 04:24 PM] namthorn#0000
but I can take requests


[17-Jan-22 04:25 PM] namthorn#0000
pretty small base atm w/ 2 CHP 1 EXT 1 POL


[17-Jan-22 04:29 PM] insensless72#0000
Im always in the market for FLUX, I also need some DDT and AMM


[17-Jan-22 04:30 PM] insensless72#0000
Nvm AMM not on griffonstone


[17-Jan-22 04:30 PM] insensless72#0000
Also, DLR cant produce enough PG for corp if that is something youre interested in producing


[17-Jan-22 04:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling has 2 labs and 3 CHP on Griffonstone for vertical chlorine recipes


[17-Jan-22 04:31 PM] dasefx1#0000
DDT I make on griffistone sometimes I had extra


[17-Jan-22 04:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PG always makes money, guaranteed


[17-Jan-22 04:31 PM] namthorn#0000
yea I can do some FLX and PG scaling into DDT later, sure


[17-Jan-22 04:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
EPO too, but sometimes there are less buyers


[17-Jan-22 04:41 PM] insensless72#0000
just let us know what you produce before you take it to market! Corp players would buy and benefit more than randos


[17-Jan-22 04:53 PM] namthorn#0000
Will do


[18-Feb-22 10:42 AM] cazertanu#0000
I want to look up the planitary info and local market for Griffonstone, but my ships are busy so I can't search for it.

[18-Feb-22 10:58 AM] namthorn#0000
it's a chemistry world mainly


[18-Feb-22 11:11 AM] allocater#0000
maybe we should get cheap PE/PG from there


[18-Feb-22 11:19 AM] dasefx1#0000
it is good for EPO, DDT, TCL


[18-Feb-22 11:20 AM] namthorn#0000
i do produce pg and sell it at 16/u on nike, it gets bought up within usually 5 mins


[18-Feb-22 11:20 AM] namthorn#0000
PE there's nothing to be gained, that comes from a BMP which benefits from a manufacturing CoGC/experts rather than chemistry

{Reactions}
👍 

[18-Feb-22 11:22 AM] namthorn#0000
better off either doing that on A1C for the CoGC or wherever you'd use the PE


[18-Feb-22 03:58 PM] insensless72#0000
Anyone producing CL @here?


[18-Feb-22 04:21 PM] namthorn#0000
Mainly for own use but I have a little in surplus, how much did you want?


[18-Feb-22 04:27 PM] insensless72#0000
Tbh as many as possible, I'm taking them to Nike for EPO


[18-Feb-22 04:31 PM] namthorn#0000
ah, k. I can probably spare 20. Haven't really sold it before so, what's the normal price you pay elsewhere? i'll just dock a % off that.


[18-Feb-22 04:32 PM] namthorn#0000
I can also produce some more EPO and send it to Nike if you need more in than you can produce.


[18-Feb-22 04:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill take the EPO off you if you want to bring it to Nike, ill buy all of what you make. I just funnel it into rfabs


[18-Feb-22 04:33 PM] insensless72#0000
I only have 3 POL on Nike so im having trouble keeping enough to make RSE combined with RBH


[18-Feb-22 04:34 PM] namthorn#0000
kk. i can swtch to 1/2 and 1/2 PG/EPO so I should be able to bring you 600-700 a week. i usually stop off to sell pg anyway.


[18-Feb-22 04:34 PM] insensless72#0000
alternatively you could take it to Deimos if you dont want the extra stop


[18-Feb-22 04:35 PM] insensless72#0000
I would also buy all the PG you bring as well


[18-Feb-22 04:35 PM] namthorn#0000
i dont mind stopping off, even better if i can trade it in for lst


[18-Feb-22 04:35 PM] insensless72#0000
looking like a 1 stop shop to me. Ill buy your EPO and PG and sell you the LST


[18-Feb-22 04:36 PM] namthorn#0000
sounds like a plan


[18-Feb-22 04:37 PM] namthorn#0000
It's prob not worth coming over to griffonstone for a tiny amount of CL so shall I bring whatever excess i have over to nike next time i stop there?


[18-Feb-22 04:37 PM] insensless72#0000
Please, ill still need to fuel the POL plants


[18-Feb-22 04:38 PM] namthorn#0000
kk, i can prob do that leg in a couple of days, ship's currently on the way back here from the CX.


[18-Feb-22 04:39 PM] insensless72#0000
No worries, just @ me when its on the way


[18-Feb-22 04:39 PM] namthorn#0000
will do


[19-Feb-22 05:45 AM] cazertanu#0000
Thank you


[20-Feb-22 01:22 PM] namthorn#0000
on its way now. 20 CL, 2810 PG, 400 EPO


[21-Feb-22 06:21 PM] rune_242#0000
Does anybody have FLX?


[21-Feb-22 07:22 PM] colerror#0000
I have some on Nike if you want to collect there or pick up somewhere central


[21-Feb-22 07:23 PM] rune_242#0000
are you going to cx?


[21-Feb-22 07:25 PM] colerror#0000
I can make a pitstop there on the way to KI, I'd be there around this time tomorrow


[21-Feb-22 07:26 PM] rune_242#0000
what is your price?


[21-Feb-22 07:27 PM] colerror#0000
Call it 80?


[21-Feb-22 07:27 PM] rune_242#0000
sure


[21-Feb-22 07:28 PM] rune_242#0000
Can i buy 200?


[21-Feb-22 07:29 PM] colerror#0000
I think I'll have around 180, but I'll let you know in the morning


[21-Feb-22 07:30 PM] rune_242#0000
i cannot put i buy ad in cx


[21-Feb-22 07:30 PM] rune_242#0000
a other guy is buying 150 at 95/pcs


[21-Feb-22 07:31 PM] colerror#0000
Put a buy on Nike, and a 1 AIC shipping to CX? Would just need to rent a warehouse to do it


[21-Feb-22 07:31 PM] rune_242#0000
going to nike a few days anyway


[21-Feb-22 07:32 PM] rune_242#0000
il put a buy order on nike


[21-Feb-22 07:33 PM] colerror#0000
Ok


[21-Feb-22 07:33 PM] colerror#0000
If it's a few days, you can put up for 200


[21-Feb-22 07:35 PM] rune_242#0000
i also have put an lst ad


[21-Feb-22 07:37 PM] colerror#0000
Picked that up too, I'll fulfill both tomorrow


[25-Feb-22 04:42 PM] insensless72#0000
@namthorn If you have CL to sell anytime soon let me know. Ill take all you have


[25-Feb-22 04:43 PM] namthorn#0000
i don't produce much surplus, adding another CHP, POL and LAB shortly so will likely not have much excess. I will let you know if i end up with a surplus though.


[25-Feb-22 04:43 PM] namthorn#0000
that's what those LDEs were for

{Reactions}
👍 

[25-Feb-22 04:45 PM] namthorn#0000
should be pumping out 25 THF and 5 DDT/day in addition to more EPO if you have need for those


[25-Feb-22 04:46 PM] namthorn#0000
happy to sell particularly the THF at discount rates


[25-Feb-22 04:46 PM] insensless72#0000
I have a need for DDT on Harmonia but not at the rate you will be producing it. That should bring in some big $$$


[25-Feb-22 04:47 PM] namthorn#0000
probably need a week or so for the techs to come in though


[25-Feb-22 04:47 PM] namthorn#0000
still waiting on 20 for lab #1 to be at full power


[25-Feb-22 04:50 PM] namthorn#0000
i'll prob shift to Cl more once the FLX price goes back down, want to prioritise FLX as much as I can to keep the overheads down for those doing metallurgy


[25-Feb-22 04:50 PM] insensless72#0000
As it stands I could afford to buy 100-200 FLUX


[25-Feb-22 04:50 PM] namthorn#0000
150/u is almost triple the price i'd sell atxD


[25-Feb-22 04:51 PM] insensless72#0000
7 SME running on Deimos 🙃


[25-Feb-22 04:53 PM] namthorn#0000
got anything needed shifted from deimos -> ANT or any capability to go the other way? got 200 flx for sale but it's stuck at the cx atm.


[25-Feb-22 04:54 PM] namthorn#0000
i'd go myself but need to justify the cargo space on the deimos -> ant leg


[25-Feb-22 04:55 PM] insensless72#0000
currently I have 1 ship harmonia -> nike and the other 401b -> Deimos. So not currently but go for selling them on the CX first until I can commit transport


[25-Feb-22 04:56 PM] namthorn#0000
nah its np, i'd rather save it until someone in-corp could use it, prices are being gouged on flx atm on CX


[25-Feb-22 04:57 PM] namthorn#0000
either i'll bring it next week or someone will bite on my shipping ad


[25-Feb-22 05:01 PM] insensless72#0000
Up to you good sir, if someone bites on a shipping ad let me know and ill throw up a buy ad on Deimos


[13-Mar-22 09:43 AM] insensless72#0000
anyone producing CL that I can buy?


[17-Mar-22 09:16 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hi all, I just put up some ads to buy NAB in bulk on Griffonstone. I don't make it myself but I plugged in some numbers and I think cost right now is just under 50/u so I offered 60/u - is that fair? Or is there something else I need to factor in?


[17-Mar-22 09:51 AM] namthorn#0000
i think the only other thing to factor in is if anyone is actually making it, most CHPs on griffon will be running full time HAL + H20 -> NA + CL to support POLs and LABs


[17-Mar-22 09:57 AM] namthorn#0000
if you can ship over some BOR i can probably spare some CHP time to make you some though


[17-Mar-22 10:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
Electronica is best for NAB


[17-Mar-22 10:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
but only invictus there


[17-Mar-22 10:46 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Ah, that makes sense that the CX is usually all Invictus orders lol


[17-Mar-22 11:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
but his price is very good, SF cost with this price is 3.5 p/u


[17-Mar-22 11:03 AM] dasefx1#0000
so better profit than classic formula


[17-Mar-22 11:03 AM] dasefx1#0000
only slower


[17-Mar-22 11:03 AM] dasefx1#0000
but profitable and light to transport


[25-Mar-22 07:03 PM] insensless72#0000
@Griffonstone Cl is going to be in high demand shortly. If someone on planet is willing / able to expand their Cl production I will gladly help fund or provide needed fabs and construction materials


[25-Mar-22 07:15 PM] namthorn#0000
Cl over one of the Cl-related products?


[25-Mar-22 07:16 PM] namthorn#0000
also  there's a PIO shortage so HAL mining & CHP processing have taken a hit planetwide.


[25-Mar-22 07:21 PM] insensless72#0000
I didnt realize you had 8 POL lol


[25-Mar-22 07:21 PM] namthorn#0000

would highly recommend to anyone looking for a 2nd/3rd base


[25-Mar-22 07:22 PM] namthorn#0000
though i have run out of space atm so cant produce more EPO as-is, limited by my HAL mining capabilities & CHP time.


[25-Mar-22 07:22 PM] insensless72#0000
My thought process was OFF for both Nike and Phobos, requiring CL, plus current PG and EPO demand


[25-Mar-22 07:23 PM] namthorn#0000
ah, OFF uses CL?


[25-Mar-22 07:23 PM] namthorn#0000
ah i see, looked it up


[25-Mar-22 07:24 PM] namthorn#0000
well rest assured im churning out as much EPO as I can. happy to save some for turning into OFF if someone wants to do that.


[25-Mar-22 07:26 PM] namthorn#0000
looking at MotS's old logs it seems to be a few hundred OFF every week so shouldnt be too hard to cover.


[25-Mar-22 07:27 PM] insensless72#0000
It wont be bad, just getting it to a BMP on Deimos or Phobos. I dont have one myself


[25-Mar-22 07:28 PM] insensless72#0000
PG and EPO that is


[25-Mar-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
ye, should have some on Nike/Phobos/A1C i'd have thought. Also MotS seems to have 1500 OFF on the CX too so worst case scenario we're sorted there for a while.

@namthorn do you have PSL on griffonstone?


[08-Apr-22 06:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
long shot, you probably only have PG there


[08-Apr-22 07:02 PM] namthorn#0000
No, no manufacturing capability sorry.


[08-Apr-22 07:03 PM] namthorn#0000
I am planning to head there soon from ANT if you need some PSLs shipped

im doing fine, can always buy bulk elements/consumables

[06-May-22 04:03 PM] namthorn#0000
have a ton of TIO/TCO you could shift from SE-648c though


[06-May-22 04:03 PM] namthorn#0000
TIO to CX, TCO to griffonstone. either/or


[06-May-22 04:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Do you have an aprox ton estimate?


[06-May-22 04:07 PM] namthorn#0000
~1470t atm in TCO


[06-May-22 04:07 PM] namthorn#0000
TIO im actually fine, forget about that. just sold a shipload on the LM


[06-May-22 04:08 PM] namthorn#0000
have 970t/m3 in O there too


[06-May-22 04:08 PM] insensless72#0000
I can probably make that happen, ill keep you posted I have it written down


[06-May-22 04:08 PM] namthorn#0000
awesome, would be much appreciated


[10-May-22 10:30 AM] rune_242#0000
are there bulk producers of PG here?


[10-May-22 10:31 AM] namthorn#0000
i do 50/50 PG & EPO. How much are you looking for?


[10-May-22 10:31 AM] rune_242#0000
3k PG


[10-May-22 10:32 AM] rune_242#0000
you make OFF also?


[10-May-22 10:33 AM] namthorn#0000
no, just the raw materials


[10-May-22 10:33 AM] namthorn#0000
no manufacturing on-site here. No space for it


[10-May-22 10:33 AM] rune_242#0000
do have it in storage?


[10-May-22 10:34 AM] rune_242#0000
and what would be the price?


[10-May-22 10:39 AM] namthorn#0000
i have 1.8k in stock at the mo. so I'd say a couple of days to get to 3k. 15/u


[10-May-22 11:11 AM] rune_242#0000
good


[10-May-22 11:11 AM] rune_242#0000
dm when it's ready


[10-May-22 11:12 AM] rune_242#0000
I'l place an add for 3k PG 45k AIC


[10-May-22 11:12 AM] rune_242#0000
10 days delivery time


[16-May-22 12:02 PM] rune_242#0000
again here for PG


[16-May-22 12:04 PM] rune_242#0000
@namthorn can you sell me 5k?


[16-May-22 12:27 PM] rune_242#0000
that would be 75k right?


[16-May-22 12:30 PM] allocater#0000
are you bringing PG to nike or deimos? Then buy 5k for me as well.


[16-May-22 12:30 PM] rune_242#0000
to harmonia and deimos


[16-May-22 12:30 PM] rune_242#0000

[16-May-22 12:43 PM] namthorn#0000
i do not have volume for these lol. Only 1200 atm. I will save the next load for you though.


[16-May-22 12:58 PM] rune_242#0000
how long unitl you have 10k?


[16-May-22 01:08 PM] namthorn#0000
I make about 800 a day, so a while. Limiting factor is imports so i do a EPO/PG split


[16-May-22 02:47 PM] namthorn#0000
If you can bring over a ship of C + H + MG I can weight more heavily in favour of PG temporarily. I'll buy it off you for whatever you pay for it.


[19-May-22 03:26 AM] namthorn#0000
@rune_242 @allocater did either of you still want 5k PG? I should have enough tomorrow to fill one of those requests.


[19-May-22 03:28 AM] rune_242#0000
I bought 5k from someone else in the corp


[19-May-22 03:29 AM] rune_242#0000
Maybe allocator still needs it


[19-May-22 03:33 AM] namthorn#0000
nw, figured I'd ask. else it's going up on the CX at 9 more per unit lol


[19-May-22 12:25 PM] allocater#0000
I can always use more PG, ad is up


[03-Jun-22 02:36 AM] rune_242#0000
Can I buy another 5K?


[03-Jun-22 02:36 AM] rune_242#0000
no rush to this order.  still 16/u?


[03-Jun-22 05:14 AM] namthorn#0000
yea sure, will let you know when i have enough here


[04-Jun-22 07:40 AM] allocater#0000
is it worth mining that abysmal MGS?


[04-Jun-22 07:44 AM] namthorn#0000
I doubt it. MG isn't exactly expensive or bulky to ship in and you could probably make more mining extra HAL and selling it, plus you'd need a BMP to process the MGS which takes up precious area


[04-Jun-22 07:56 AM] allocater#0000
makes sense. do we have excess HAL and/or CL production or should I plan a base to be self-sufficient?


[04-Jun-22 09:19 AM] namthorn#0000
probably plan for self sufficiency. I can provide Cl/HAL on occasion but not enough to run a base off of.  Just small amounts of excess. Some people sell HAL on world but not at the best prices.

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Jun-22 09:19 AM] namthorn#0000
not sure about DLRs base


[04-Jun-22 04:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have excess HAL production as a very recent development @namthorn @allocater


[04-Jun-22 04:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i took down my CHP and am going pioneers, small scale at first


[04-Jun-22 04:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
6 EXT + consumable restock coming tomorrow


[04-Jun-22 04:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i did this as part of an agreement with @erklein who is now expanding CHP production here


[04-Jun-22 04:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the nature of CHP work though is that it is easy to overproduce HAL with small amounts of EXT.


[04-Jun-22 04:47 PM] namthorn#0000
i have some spare BSE and MCG if you want to throw down another EXT


[04-Jun-22 04:47 PM] namthorn#0000
just enough for an extra 1 if you have the spare housing


[04-Jun-22 04:53 PM] namthorn#0000
and HAL is a weird one i've found. SOmetimes it can be easy to overproduce HAL, sometimes hard to keep up with consumption, depends on both the relative quantity and condition of the EXT/CHP/POLs


[04-Jun-22 04:54 PM] namthorn#0000
probably easier to do outside of a vertical setup


[04-Jun-22 06:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ill go permanent, reliable, fixed price HAL just like i do LST on Nike


[04-Jun-22 06:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it should mostly wash out, to the same price. minus an HQ here, add 2 experts there. 6 one way and half dozen another.


[04-Jun-22 06:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
7k per 500t HAL

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 🧂 

[05-Jun-22 01:34 AM] allocater#0000
without EXT my base would need 40 HAL per day


[05-Jun-22 08:10 AM] allocater#0000
before I come with a full new base has anyone still space to fill with POL?


[05-Jun-22 10:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have space, but i was happy to lose my settlers


[05-Jun-22 12:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
66 HAL per day from me. 11 per EXT*day


[05-Jun-22 12:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@erklein will be using an estimated 20-30 per day depending on flux production


[08-Jun-22 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
Does anyone make CL on Griffonstone or anywhere else?


[08-Jun-22 12:42 PM] namthorn#0000
this be the place to do it


[08-Jun-22 12:42 PM] namthorn#0000
what Cl-related goods are you after?


[08-Jun-22 12:43 PM] churavis#0000
I just wanted a little bit to make EPO on occasion


[08-Jun-22 12:44 PM] namthorn#0000
well, i have 10 surplus right now. Cl usually isn't made as an end-product though, hence the low stock on the CX

not much point when CHP shares an industry with all the buildings that use CL


[08-Jun-22 12:48 PM] churavis#0000
That makes sense


[08-Jun-22 12:49 PM] churavis#0000
It's not urgent but can you send either 10 CL or 500 EPO to Deimos whenever convenient?


[08-Jun-22 12:49 PM] namthorn#0000
yea

hello fellow neighbors, can you share some tech suppies? ads up


[11-Jun-22 04:27 PM] insensless72#0000
@Griffonstone I have a proposition for you. I need EPO for my PP3 on Nike. I would like to potentially ask to purchase 936 CL on Griffonstone. Thats a huge ask so would also be willing to buy any EPO I could fit on the 3000 as well. basically id like to fly out and buy out your supplies. This can wait up to 2 weeks to allow you to build up the supply


[11-Jun-22 05:10 PM] namthorn#0000
not sure about that 900 odd CL. if i turned off all my POLs and labs, made nothing out of the 8 CHPs im running but Cl and had infinite HAL i would still only be able to come up with just north of 300 Cl in 2 weeks.


[11-Jun-22 05:11 PM] namthorn#0000
if we're full on flux on deimos i can switch over to more Cl and EPO production though


[11-Jun-22 05:11 PM] namthorn#0000
been prioritising that out of the CHPs for the past week or so


[11-Jun-22 05:27 PM] insensless72#0000
The only reason 936 was my quoted amount is because that is the max I could haul off planet. I wont use the 3000 to fly out there and haul 50 but if we could get it above what a reg ship can hold ill do it


[12-Jun-22 02:05 AM] allocater#0000
why do you want CL, shouldn't it processed first into EPO on planet?

Also can you bring 1000 LST when you fly here?


[12-Jun-22 08:11 AM] insensless72#0000
Yes I can bring out LST. Ordinarily yes process it on planet, but I happen to have a 3000t ship and POL plants on Nike to feed


[12-Jun-22 08:12 AM] allocater#0000
demolish POL, bring it to Griff 😄


[16-Jun-22 01:57 AM] erklein#0000
Does anyone have any REP on planet I can use, about 4? I can either pay for it or trade it back when my ship arrives with more stock in a couple days


[16-Jun-22 01:58 AM] allocater#0000
I can loan 4


[16-Jun-22 01:58 AM] allocater#0000

ah nice, will buy that off you later.


[27-Jun-22 07:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater in my opinion, the best option (one which seems to be working for @namthorn ) is to use Nike as a logistics hub, because there is a strong OOG presence there, and is a necessary fly-by for all Antares-griffonstone routes.


[27-Jun-22 07:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also it is worth noting that the Griffonstone-Nike route is a subsection of the larger ANT-BEN inter-cx trade route


[27-Jun-22 08:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
allocater, I think you could be a good candidate to supply this route with #oog-2001-odyssey , as you do inter-CX shipping and have bases at multiple positions along this route.


[28-Jun-22 01:40 AM] allocater#0000
I was mainly looking for a route to slap the small exports on. But seems C import is the biggest issue, which you can't do from Nike. 🤔


[28-Jun-22 03:57 AM] namthorn#0000
yea, I've been importing/exporting everythign myself for a while. I have a ship constantly full bringing in supplies/product out of griffonstone atm.


[28-Jun-22 03:58 AM] namthorn#0000
very resource intensive but the goods are so useful and lucrative.


[28-Jun-22 07:48 AM] dersix#0000
I'm doing Cosumables import and EPO/TCL/THF export on my own while the import of HAL/H/C/H2O is done through contracts (a bit of new player substitution :) )

[28-Jun-22 11:04 AM] namthorn#0000
yea I sent my stock to heph. I could add another lab or two if we're starting to use more lab products in general.

DEC production is on phobos for the ships by @bitcoin_ape


[29-Jun-22 01:32 PM] allocater#0000
EPO is shipped to Nike, @insensless72 probably has a huge stockpile. I also have 3000 in transit and 1000 on ANT


[29-Jun-22 01:34 PM] allocater#0000
and 350 on griff


[29-Jun-22 01:34 PM] dersix#0000
ok so for the DEC, they are for the phobos ACA, so most likely DLR can put them in 🙂


[29-Jun-22 01:35 PM] dersix#0000
and for EPO I was looking for 5k+, but I don't want to clear the complete corp, so I've to push my chem base a bit faster


[29-Jun-22 01:36 PM] insensless72#0000
I burn 1k every 2 days on RSE then some go into ASE

churning out only TCL and THF atm. how much DDT do you go through roughly? I haven't made any in a while.


[07-Jul-22 01:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
I would buy some DDT potentially. Not much, like 5 units per week perhaps. I would ship it to Harmonia.


[07-Jul-22 01:51 PM] erklein#0000
I usually make some DDT occasionally. I’ve already moved most of it to Harmonia and got a small stockpile there for sale

[14-Jul-22 04:28 PM] namthorn#0000
maybe, but i doubt it unless the MG price goes up drastically. C is ~6-8x the price of MG normally so makes up the bulk of the price of PG.


[14-Jul-22 04:29 PM] namthorn#0000
also stop buying my price-gouged AF glass on the CX. if you want GL buy it on the LM xD


[14-Jul-22 05:05 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think of it as time when all those POL aren’t running because they are missing an input


[14-Jul-22 05:06 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Do love the idea of reasonable GL prices!


[14-Jul-22 05:07 PM] namthorn#0000
place em on deimos, myself or @yjhasaday likely will have some GL in stock.


[14-Jul-22 05:08 PM] namthorn#0000
reasonable point in the POL not running, i'm assuming that market gap will be filled with my earlier statement.

Looking to buy some chemical stuffs - if I send a ship out to Griffonstone would there be people who could sell me any amount of the following?

EPO
TCL
PFE (or REA or BRM to make it myself)
SOI

And of course I'll take some PG if its lying around lol
Planning on taking some NA off your inventory too


[30-Jul-22 03:38 AM] allocater#0000
Griff is import limited, so I regularly ship out stuff with 90% empty ships. If you fly there can you bring cargo full of C? Current stores:
500 EPO
6 TCL
REA you can get on phobos for 250/u
SOI was also on phobos but not sure if DLR is still running it
PG 2500


[30-Jul-22 03:39 AM] allocater#0000
KV is on heph, we convert TCL usually


[30-Jul-22 07:11 AM] namthorn#0000
.if you're shipping 90% empty i have a toon of NA and SI you can have for free

@yjhasaday I can sell you 4k EPO on griffonstone & 2.8k on Nike


[30-Jul-22 07:14 AM] namthorn#0000
also would pay for a shipload of C/LST too


[30-Jul-22 07:15 AM] namthorn#0000
or H


[30-Jul-22 07:19 AM] domicius#0000
You guys want me to fly Heavy Time to griff?


[30-Jul-22 07:23 AM] namthorn#0000
i'm sure we'd buy an entire 3k hold worth of C between us. but not sure we can utilise your hold space well on the way out. As a lot of the exports have similar mass:volume ratios


[30-Jul-22 07:23 AM] allocater#0000
if you can get that much carbon, sure


[30-Jul-22 07:24 AM] namthorn#0000
i have ~1k ton/vol of NA and ~1k ton ~500 vol of SI to ship out as waste.


[30-Jul-22 07:26 AM] domicius#0000
I'll send it out empty, don't worry about it. First a detour to Nike.


[30-Jul-22 07:28 AM] namthorn#0000
if you're coming from nike i'll buy 1kt of LST


[30-Jul-22 07:28 AM] namthorn#0000
actually 2


[30-Jul-22 07:28 AM] domicius#0000
Sure


[30-Jul-22 07:29 AM] domicius#0000
Just post it up on Nike.


[30-Jul-22 07:29 AM] namthorn#0000
i mean i'll buy it at griffonstone, i dont have 2kt space on nike, no base there lol


[30-Jul-22 07:30 AM] namthorn#0000
i turn it into FLX on griffonstone to supply our smelters on deimos. having a huge stockpile would let me make substantially more FLX

Ship is on its way out, I was able to scrounge up the following for you guys to buy:
72 C @270/u
123 LST @35/u

Ad is up for the 2.8K EPO on Nike


[30-Jul-22 10:49 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yeah, that's what I want the TCL for - I have 4 weaving plants hungry to make more KV lol

I put ads up for your EPO, TCL, and PG. I used Namthorns prices on the spreadsheet (with a little bump for inflation) let me know if its not enough and I'll repost!


[30-Jul-22 10:51 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Lets see how full the ship gets then I will gladly max the rest of it out with NA and SI. Its just a 500 standard ship though so it will fill up pretty quick lol


[31-Jul-22 07:36 AM] allocater#0000
500 LST available 40/u


[31-Jul-22 10:07 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hey all, I still have 72 C available @ 270/u.
Also anyone else with EPO or TCL for sale before I take off?


[31-Jul-22 10:10 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Ad is up for 4k EPO, thanks!


[31-Jul-22 10:10 AM] namthorn#0000
I sold rune 2k. only 3k EPO available atm but i'll happily sell that to you


[31-Jul-22 10:11 AM] namthorn#0000
can also give you some NA if you're not full after that


[31-Jul-22 10:14 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, changed the ad to 3K, also I saw you got my NA ad, do you have SI as well? We're short on SEA so I can make that with it


[31-Jul-22 10:14 AM] namthorn#0000
i handed off the SI to allocater yesterday for electronics inputs


[31-Jul-22 10:14 AM] namthorn#0000
i do have a few hundred SI at ANT id be happy to hand over though


[31-Jul-22 10:16 AM] namthorn#0000
i can make a shipping ad to nike if you're ever going that route


[31-Jul-22 10:16 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Nah, thats okay, I go through SI very slowly. I just thought it was a win-win if I could take some off your inventory space


[31-Jul-22 10:16 AM] namthorn#0000
i do have 16 if you want that!


[31-Jul-22 10:16 AM] namthorn#0000
1 days worth


[31-Jul-22 10:16 AM] yjhasaday#0000
actually, yes! I only have 10 for SEA so a litte bit would be great

550 on Nike would save me a trip to Griff. I need it for my pp3 on Nike to build rfabs I need for myself. 200/u?

[10-Aug-22 01:39 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Hey chemists, just a quick warning that MGS prices are outrageous right now so MG will probably continue to rise. Unless you have a reliable supplier with their own MGS supply it might not be a bad idea to make sure you have some extra MG on hand lol. I used to supply DLR with MG but I've stopped making it due to MGS costs


[10-Aug-22 01:42 PM] allocater#0000

[13-Oct-22 09:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm not interested. It takes too much energy. Maybe I'll consider it when my business expansion reaches a bottleneck and enters a stable period.


[13-Oct-22 09:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
Domination of Planet is obviously a loss-making business, suitable for old players with high income. With the loss of four old players in a row, I think it is more important to supplement new blood and develop advanced industries.


[13-Oct-22 09:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now the planet's taxes have been reduced too much, and all people's incomes together may not be able to maintain Griif alone.


[13-Oct-22 09:23 PM] churavis#0000
It's only loss-making if you just count taxes. If multiple corp members have high tier, high profit production lines on the planet then it will easily be worth it to pay a bit more in upkeep and programs just to make sure there is a sufficient supply of engineers and scientists, rather than risk it with some penny-pinching rando.


[13-Oct-22 09:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
I agree to donate to the infrastructure, which is necessary. We can see how the successor is doing. If the new successor is not responsible, we can get it back next time.

[25-Oct-22 01:18 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Can anyone else fill any of my PG or EPO ads? Ship is leaving soon, was hoping to get a bit more


[25-Oct-22 02:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I've got 10k PG coming into ANT tomorrow that I can send to Nike if that helps out.  Our PG/EPO supply has taken a big hit recently


[25-Oct-22 02:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I've moved my PG operations to Electronica and am going to add my third Chem base at KI-840c soon to help with EPO


[31-Oct-22 11:25 AM] jackinabox86#0000
@Griffonstone do we have any HAL sellers?  I assume you're still getting set up, @sginga ?


[31-Oct-22 11:50 AM] allocater#0000
I am down to 149 which will last until the base is setup I think, but if you are completely out, we can share it


[31-Oct-22 01:13 PM] thummper#0000
I have 200 spare, i have excess production but probably not for long


[31-Oct-22 02:48 PM] exeler#0000
I have a decent stockpile for anyone in case of an emergency, but I don't produce any of it myself.

It seems like every time I stock up on something I see posts about it being hard to find 😅

unless someone is desperate you can sell HAL into those 200/u LM offers


[01-Nov-22 11:41 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Now if we could just switch Griff to resource extraction, we’d really be swimming in HAL


[01-Nov-22 11:42 AM] churavis#0000
And starving for everything else


[01-Nov-22 11:42 AM] balbar#0000
feast AND famine in one convenient package 🙂


[01-Nov-22 11:44 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Could be a fun change of pace


[01-Nov-22 11:44 AM] churavis#0000
Change?


[01-Nov-22 12:09 PM] sginga#0000
Alright, i'll do that for now, but if anyone needs HAL they just need to send me a contract.


[01-Nov-22 12:11 PM] churavis#0000
Add your name and the price of your HAL to the OOG spreadsheet for everyone to reference.


[03-Nov-22 11:42 AM] allocater#0000
where is the next flight to griff from? I forgot to bring the MG and it doesn't justify a solo flight, so maybe I can put on somewhere


[03-Nov-22 11:43 AM] rune_242#0000
I can sell you 500 on griffonstone


[03-Nov-22 11:44 AM] rune_242#0000
50/u

those HAL requests cleared out nicely


[04-Nov-22 11:56 AM] allocater#0000
if you have excess HAL and don't want to ship it, you can offer it on the market to see who bites


[04-Nov-22 11:57 AM] churavis#0000
You can probably get CX prices for it too


[04-Nov-22 12:14 PM] sginga#0000
yeah, i'm filling out some corp price orders and i should be able to fill your 50/u order by tomorrow @allocater


[04-Nov-22 12:17 PM] sginga#0000
then I'll probably start posting some 250/u sell orders but I'd take any non corp buy order around 200/u


[04-Nov-22 12:24 PM] exeler#0000
I will 1000% buy HAL directly on griffonstone. I use enough of it that shipping it in is a real pain combined with shipping in C. 

Especially since I effectively have no weight or volume to ship off.


[04-Nov-22 07:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I will buy lots of HAL as well just send a sell contract at whatever price! There’s no need to sell to those non corp pukes


[08-Nov-22 03:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I need some HAL. Is the new base ready for supply?


[08-Nov-22 02:13 PM] allocater#0000
yup, @sginga fulfills LM ads

Whats the corp price for HAL now?

is the @sginga base at 500 area yet?  Will do whatever necessary to get that base pumping!


[10-Nov-22 08:43 PM] gladeowl#0000
Never thought HAL is in such high demand.


[10-Nov-22 09:23 PM] exeler#0000
I think it's because nobody is running a CHP base that's cranking out CL, so anyone running POL needs to make their own CL from HAL, but adding in EXT to get the HAL itself means you barely have any room left for the POL which is what you actually wanted to build in the first place.

At least, that's how my train of thought went when I decided not to extract my own HAL when planning my base on griffonstone 😅

{Reactions}
💯 

[11-Nov-22 02:14 AM] allocater#0000
ad up for SI garbage collection


[11-Nov-22 02:40 AM] gladeowl#0000
If the demand is still high even with sginga's base, then I could see about getting another base up for HAL, maybe even double up with some CL production as well. I have a future use for a steady stream of NA, so that's a bonus.


[11-Nov-22 02:58 AM] exeler#0000
I would 100% sponsor this, especially if I could buy reasonably priced CL


[11-Nov-22 03:12 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Nirces is having a fire sale on a couple of planets so far, this might be interesting to anyone with spare cash?

Great. Maybe we need another one!


[11-Nov-22 10:27 AM] sginga#0000
i could add some permits and double production but i'd probably eventually scrap those buildings unless demand is really that high.


[11-Nov-22 11:05 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don’t know what you should waste permits, but demand is pretty high. What’s your daily production?


[11-Nov-22 03:12 PM] sginga#0000
~180


[11-Nov-22 03:12 PM] sginga#0000
it would only be temporary if i did, i cant afford any new bases at the moment anyways


[11-Nov-22 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
The first few HQ upgrades are pretty cheap, we could help sponsor those

First 9 CHP's up! Pioneer pop solid, settler will apparently take a few days to populate though. Only got 87/540. Gonna be slooow going at first, but should ramp up fairly quick over the week 😄


[12-Jan-23 04:41 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Your pop will only increase once per week when the population report comes in, so it will take weeks rather than days.

Oh. And most of the bids are literally yours XD

CL@1.8k should be more balanced

Is the price just inflated right now due to low supply?


[12-Jan-23 10:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
I calculated that in this case, the income of your Griff base is about 40k per day.


[12-Jan-23 10:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
CL is limited by the number of chemical bases. For me, chemical bases are always insufficient.

Done. Any insight into the complaints about pricing on higher tier populations? Those are generally much more profitable for people so the tax shouldn't be huge relative to the money made on them.


[13-Feb-23 12:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
The tax you set for electronics engineers is too low.


[13-Feb-23 12:41 AM] dehzhas#0000
Also, the POPR is headed in the wrong direction and we nearly doubled open jobs for Settlers last time.


[13-Feb-23 12:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
In addition, you can consider reducing the tax on PIO and SET, considering that this mainly affects newcomers. Engineers and scientists, you can charge more.


[13-Feb-23 12:42 AM] dehzhas#0000
I didn't change those from what they were. I am planning on doing another "adjustment" after the next POPR to tune it again. I'm trying to avoid a revolt though.

Obviously, you don't collect much tax. But you need to fully explain and communicate with players, and win over some people through differentiated tax rates.

Umbra is a chemical planet about the size of griff. Nike is the most populous planet closest to griff. Both of them have reference significance.


[13-Feb-23 12:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
The group with the largest number of players mainly uses PIO and SET and is more sensitive to tax rates. Players like me who use ENG don't care much about your tax increase.


[13-Feb-23 01:23 AM] dehzhas#0000
I've dropped 750k on stuff for Griff since becoming governor. Almost everything was completely empty.

In addition, if you pay others to donate materials, you'd better buy them and donate them yourself. This will help win votes.

People's tolerance for low-end population shortage is usually low.


[13-Feb-23 01:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
So the most urgent problem is the gap of SET.


[13-Feb-23 01:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can even temporarily switch to the SET immigration program.


[13-Feb-23 01:34 AM] dehzhas#0000
My current guess is settlers will hit somewhere near 85% happiness with the current plan (based on Archiel's spreadsheet + Festivities III which is running now. The main issue is I only have a partial period with full up before the next POPR, so I will be shy of that somewhat. The one after that should be huge.


[13-Feb-23 01:35 AM] dehzhas#0000
Also, I'm still stuck with festivities II for the next 2 days


[13-Feb-23 01:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think most people will tolerate this as long as you upgrade the INF and keep the materials supplemented.


[13-Feb-23 01:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
You need to buy Festivities III or SET immigration programs to make them think that you have done what is necessary.


[13-Feb-23 01:40 AM] dehzhas#0000
I have already purchased Fest. III so it will start next


[13-Feb-23 01:41 AM] dehzhas#0000
I'm planning on giving another update post POPR to reiterate the strategy and make sure everyone sees we are on target.


[13-Feb-23 01:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
You need to give a full explanation to the players. Such a huge population gap can't be filled in a week or two, and it takes a while to improve happiness.


[13-Feb-23 01:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that CL is so important, this population gap will often occur in the future until the plot is full.😄


[13-Feb-23 01:42 AM] dehzhas#0000
ok, I will do that tomorrow morning after my ship arrives and I fill things up


[13-Feb-23 01:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think I added fuel to the fire. We have been sponsoring CL base all this time.


[13-Feb-23 01:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
So it also helps you succeed in the election.🤣

LS-746b seems like a nice planet. No extra resources needed for construction, so that's pretty nice. Judging by the population there's probably only 1... maybe 2 active bases there. I've maxed my chemistry bases too. Not sure on when I'll try to get another permit though

can I buy 750 NR?


[14-Feb-23 10:25 AM] rune_242#0000
there is only 550 on the CX😅


[14-Feb-23 10:31 AM] churavis#0000
I can sell you 750 NR in 10 hours, but not on a regular basis. I can provide NCS on a regular basis if you or anyone else wants to setup their own supply.


[14-Feb-23 10:31 AM] rune_242#0000
I need the NR for an HQ upgrade
when I have that I can make my own


[14-Feb-23 10:32 AM] rune_242#0000

Yeah, there were 3669 open jobs before, but 2673 now, even after adding over 6k new settlers

this will bring in quite a bit of taxes


[14-Feb-23 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
hehehe I'll run the sheet on griff


[14-Feb-23 11:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
ahhhh I hit the data limit on google sheets / fio... I will run the report in a bit


[14-Feb-23 11:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, really nice growth this report. It's basically carried by the unemployment and festivals which are really keeping people happy. Next report should be great too. There's a big increase in demand, especially there on the settlers. But since the growth is so high, I don't think anyone's going to be waiting multiple weeks to get filled.


[14-Feb-23 11:49 AM] archielvahr#0000
Even this term the true happiness was pretty low. There's an infrastructure shortage everywhere.


[14-Feb-23 11:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ideally there'd be 7 INFs, 3 PAR, 2 ART. Should a HOS be built in place of an INF? Actually maybe. BNDs, RED, BSC are cheaper per unit health than OFF in the INF.


[14-Feb-23 11:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
And each INF costs more than the previous.


[14-Feb-23 11:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
downside is no one really makes the HOS stuff 🤷


[14-Feb-23 11:55 AM] churavis#0000
I've thought about getting into HOS stuff, I've already got the electronics side built out


[14-Feb-23 11:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
As far as upkeep... continue to rely on festivals as much as possible because they are cheap. Filling all the upkeep to 100% with the current buildings is gonna cost 900k a week.


[14-Feb-23 12:00 PM] churavis#0000
The problem with relying of festivals all the time is that you won't have it as an extra emergency booster in case something comes up and you won't have flexibility to run other programs if needed.


[14-Feb-23 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, heh


[14-Feb-23 12:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
920k per week gets you between 40% and 55% of needs satisfied on griff, so another 20% from the festival is pretty good.


[14-Feb-23 12:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah the sheet is really having trouble calculating today


[14-Feb-23 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, so if we supply all upkeep we can produce 16k safety and 14k health. But 100% satisfaction is 30k safety and 22k health. 100% shouldn't be a target, but neither should filling in the most expensive upkeep items to 100%


[14-Feb-23 12:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, Griff has a good ratio of each population. The non-immigrating tiers don't outnumber the earlier tiers. So that helps the situation.


[14-Feb-23 12:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Comfort can be capped by Health if the PAR is filled, so watch out for that...


[14-Feb-23 12:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think you're doing a good job if Change > Open Jobs


[14-Feb-23 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
6432 new Settlers, 2673 open jobs. That's fine, everyone will be covered next week at that rate.

Planets such as griff and SE-648C, which are far away from ANT, had better store more consumables.

It's all on ZV-759d


[07-Aug-23 12:34 PM] domicius#0000

[07-Aug-23 01:05 PM] rune_242#0000
Same for me pls


[07-Aug-23 01:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have a YK-005d base


[07-Aug-23 01:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I only have an excess of about 26/d in HAL right now, but I think I can add another EXT if there's this much interest


[07-Aug-23 01:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
I do also have an excess of about 15/d CL, if that might be more interesting


[07-Aug-23 01:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
with another EXT, that'll put me at 50 HAL/d excess


[07-Aug-23 01:30 PM] martin1194#0000
grad to hear.


[07-Aug-23 02:01 PM] rune_242#0000
I would rather have the HAL since I already have a CHP setup


[07-Aug-23 02:01 PM] rune_242#0000
I come pick it up too


[07-Aug-23 02:03 PM] higgsy#0000
I could setup a HAL base on ZV-759d, but I'd have to finish building my 4th ship.


[07-Aug-23 02:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll get much, much better results from YK-005d


[07-Aug-23 02:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's really not that much farther


[07-Aug-23 02:08 PM] higgsy#0000
Ok then


[07-Aug-23 02:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's 10.5 HAL/d vs 17.8, + COGC exists on 005d


[07-Aug-23 02:08 PM] higgsy#0000
Because Griff is barely a supply for me


[07-Aug-23 03:34 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
You still need? I got 500 I can spare right now.

@neth_havoc thoughts on raising taxes on scientists and trying to beef up their population?


[08-Aug-23 10:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
standard seems to be 1400


[08-Aug-23 10:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
and we're at 10% of that


[08-Aug-23 10:48 AM] hernanduer#0000
check out Archiel's sheet as well, the UNI is overfunded without a culture center


[08-Aug-23 10:52 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I had just found the sheet and will take a deeper look later. Regarding the scientists I had already started an immigration program.


[08-Aug-23 10:55 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Yes, the taxes could be raised. The majority of the (future) scientist will be working for @melon164. 🤔


[08-Aug-23 10:55 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Is there a sheet that shows/compares the different taxes of planets?


[08-Aug-23 10:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
that'd be a good sheet, maybe someone has it... @archielvahr ?


[08-Aug-23 10:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
I just poke around the local rules of core worlds to check


[08-Aug-23 10:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ohh interesting


[08-Aug-23 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do have a planet tracker, but I don't have tax rates on them.


[08-Aug-23 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Taxes are always too low, I find. Most of the time people are happy with tax increases, unless there's already a contested election happening. I think you can just post something in local like a 2 sentence thing about bringing taxes in line with other planets and that it still doesn't cover upkeep costs, then raise them to whatever you want


[08-Aug-23 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I enjoy my OOG dividend charts, and growing our tax base is a fun part of the game for me


[08-Aug-23 11:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
it'll be very interesting if they give the new taxing entities a full financial sheet. It sounded like they'd have to, since they'll have complex contracts for infrastructure upkeep and rents for space elevators


[08-Aug-23 11:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
then we can really balance things as a corp


[08-Aug-23 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, there was all that talk about having an "embezzle" item which really raises a lot of questions about how it would work


[08-Aug-23 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Can I buy OFF with my governor account and ship it in my normal ship to my planet?


[08-Aug-23 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Can I buy OFF with my governor account and sell it with my normal account? 😄


[08-Aug-23 11:03 AM] hernanduer#0000
if they're contracts, then the prices would end up whatever the governor agrees to


[08-Aug-23 11:03 AM] hernanduer#0000
so I guess the governor would contract himself for something like 300/u DW or some such


[08-Aug-23 11:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
but then, that also begs the question, will each planet's taxing entity get its own wallet to actually embezzle from? Cause right now everything is just sent to corp wallets and distributed weekly


[08-Aug-23 11:04 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd guess yes


[08-Aug-23 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I got the impression it would be separate wallets


[08-Aug-23 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
But it would be weird to have separate inventories


[08-Aug-23 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
and you would need separate inventories to contract 300 DW from yourself to your government entity


[08-Aug-23 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
it sounded more like they'd have a contract condition "Add X of mat Y into planetary infrastructure Z every T weeks" and then they'd get paid for that


[08-Aug-23 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
but the contractor wouldn't be the governor's company, but the planet taxing entity


[08-Aug-23 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ahhh


[08-Aug-23 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
That could be a nice business, bringing piles of RAT/PE/MCG/DW and OFF to different planets


[08-Aug-23 11:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, it'd also give much greater use to the PHF


[08-Aug-23 11:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
since the contracts are guarenteed income basically


[08-Aug-23 11:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
should make the items a lot cheaper


[08-Aug-23 11:26 AM] melon164#0000
I can hardly object to SCI taxes 🙂


[08-Aug-23 12:36 PM] churavis#0000
With as large of a population that Griffonstone has, an education program will likely produce more scientists than an immigrating program, it certainly does on Phobos


[15-Aug-23 10:51 AM] churavis#0000
@neth_havoc The Griffonstone POPR is not looking so good, do you need help upgrading infrastructure?


[15-Aug-23 11:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
oof yeah, the buildings are in need of a couple levels, but they're missing some supplies too


[15-Aug-23 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
you pretty much have to permanently run festivities to keep things in line, with the current building levels


[15-Aug-23 11:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
assuming you continue to do the festivities, then supplying and upgrading these seems to be the best bet (note levels here don't match what exists)

[15-Aug-23 11:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
to get it to a point where you can drop festivities costs like, 850k/week. I doubt the festivities cost 500k

[15-Aug-23 01:18 PM] rune_242#0000

[15-Aug-23 01:22 PM] churavis#0000
@hernanduer  said he has a HAL base on YK-005d, but I don't know if it has enough capacity


[15-Aug-23 01:48 PM] neth_havoc#0000
I was a little bit under stress the last days, so totally missed filling the infrastructure, although I had the stuff in my base. 😓


[15-Aug-23 01:48 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Yes, upgrading should be the next step logical step.


[15-Aug-23 01:49 PM] neth_havoc#0000
The numbers in the building column are the level?


[15-Aug-23 01:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes, basically a couple SSTs, PARs and ARTs and a new iNF


[15-Aug-23 01:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
expensive upgrades, but they've been put off for a while


[15-Aug-23 01:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
griff has woefully poorer infrastructure despite it having a higher tech population than Nike


[15-Aug-23 01:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
but I think we can all pitch in on this one 😄


[15-Aug-23 01:57 PM] churavis#0000
Run a festival as a short term measure, we'll reimburse you if you need, then run the numbers to figure out what infrastructure you need long term


[15-Aug-23 02:02 PM] neth_havoc#0000
I started a festival already and will look at what infrastructure is needed.

Excellent, you'll want to tell everyone in the planetary chat what you've done and what your plans are so they don't get the wrong impression of you.

looks like the WOR are already supplied to the ART

ZV-639d

That's the name of it. I've got a base with just a bunch of CHP that mostly makes NS, but I ship some HAL out there regularly to make CL as well.


[25-Aug-23 03:33 PM] fremen45#0000

[25-Aug-23 03:37 PM] higgsy#0000
I'm making HAL on Griff now, but just enough for me. Trying to decide whether to move extracting and processing to other planets. There's plenty of chemistry planets around. Or if I want to buy HAL.

I would like to snag some in the short term either way though 🙂

Looks like in buy contracts the seller cannot put goods directly into cargo hold of the buyer


[29-Oct-23 01:36 AM] allocater#0000
anybody still producing HAL here? ad up on LM just in case


[30-Oct-23 01:17 PM] mrsmith33#0000
NS order up


[30-Oct-23 02:11 PM] exeler#0000
Do you need it on Griff, or would ANT work?


[30-Oct-23 02:11 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Ant is better


[02-Nov-23 02:15 PM] churavis#0000
Does anyone have spare AML capacity to turn my TAI into TA?


[02-Nov-23 02:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
how much?


[02-Nov-23 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have maybe 3 AML worth of spare capacity


[02-Nov-23 02:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
just making extra W and BOS right now


[02-Nov-23 02:28 PM] churavis#0000
I have 60 TAI I need converted one time, so 30 batches. I estimate the cost of consumables and upkeep to be just under 2000 per batch so I'll pay 4000 per batch. It's not urgent


[02-Nov-23 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay send both contracts - 300 hours 21% time of 8 AMLs - call it 1.5 AML-hours, so 200 hours to do them all. 9 day lead time on sending them back?


[02-Nov-23 02:31 PM] churavis#0000
How about 6 days for the first half and 12 for the second?


[02-Nov-23 02:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
sure


[02-Nov-23 02:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
should be done in ~4


[02-Nov-23 02:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
and ~8.5


[02-Nov-23 02:33 PM] churavis#0000
I'll send you contracts in a moment, thanks


[02-Nov-23 02:36 PM] churavis#0000
If you want the FE then your welcome to keep it, otherwise I can take care of it for you


[02-Nov-23 02:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
I use plenty of FE, can repurpose it np 🙂

[02-Nov-23 02:40 PM] churavis#0000
I don't just want TA, I also want to get rid of the TAI, I tried selling it before but no one bit


[02-Nov-23 02:40 PM] churavis#0000
I'll hit you up for more if I ever run out of what this gives me


[13-Nov-23 06:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
@exeler do you have 280 NS on ANT/Demeter/Nike?


[13-Nov-23 02:55 PM] martin1194#0000
Send me contact


[13-Nov-23 02:55 PM] martin1194#0000
I have it in ant


[13-Nov-23 03:06 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Noted. I already bought it from CX, as I needed to depart. The next buy will be in 15-20 days


[13-Nov-23 03:10 PM] martin1194#0000
I will update my excel later:PikaJoy:


[13-Nov-23 03:30 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Though by that time I will probably build a new chem base that will produce NS (on ZV-639d)


[13-Nov-23 03:33 PM] churavis#0000
Now is a good time to be in the NS business, in or outside the corp


[13-Nov-23 03:37 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I will be producing CL DDT FLX N NA NS TCL THF at first


[13-Nov-23 04:50 PM] exeler#0000
Sorry I was late to reply, I actually don't have any NS on ANT right now. I just split my stock there between my two HYF bases. 

If you want some on Harmonia I've got a good bit there though 😅


[06-Dec-23 10:54 AM] melon164#0000
Does anyone have 10 LTA here before I send an emergency ship out?  Brought LBH instead 🤦‍♂️


[06-Dec-23 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000

he'll probably get more votes


[26-Jun-24 09:00 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's unlikely we'll be able to squeeze him out pretty much anywhere, he's too vocal and has too many patsies

[27-Jun-24 02:26 PM] domicius#0000
I didn't know who voted for me, so I didn't want to withdraw and votes go to Filth

[27-Jun-24 05:37 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I voted for you, hoping to make it a OOG clean sweep. I'm happy to have you as the 3rd, so perhaps I should withdraw and ping this channel to vote again?


[27-Jun-24 05:41 PM] domicius#0000
Ping everyone to vote again first. It's better


[27-Jun-24 05:42 PM] domicius#0000
Also, I feel we should wait until closer to the vote ends date before doing anything


[27-Jun-24 05:43 PM] domicius#0000
Also, your in the lead, so just hold on to it


[27-Jun-24 06:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am out of the house for the rest of the evening, but I started writing a ping that I intend to send to everyone. But we should probably make sure we give people at least 12 hours to vote since people might be sleeping or only check the game once a day.


[03-Aug-24 07:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
@neth_havoc we probably need to look at Griff POPI, the next POPR isn't gonna be pretty


[03-Aug-24 07:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
would be good to run festivities beforehand


[03-Aug-24 07:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
in fact I'm already short 24 ENG


[03-Aug-24 08:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
SST needs OFF I think, INF you can reduce level to 7 and then also fund TUB


[03-Aug-24 08:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
increase the ART to level 5, then you only need 1 input, and increase the UNI to level 2


[03-Aug-24 08:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
that'll bring all base happinesses up to over 50%


[03-Aug-24 09:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah we should definitely kick off a festival. They add on top of the resulting happiness so even with the time delay on averaging over the past weeks, it will help


[03-Aug-24 09:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
cause last week had low numbers so it will be a little slow to pull up.


[03-Aug-24 09:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hern, did you put it into gov helper? For the Safety numbers?


[03-Aug-24 09:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
The 2nd tick on the SST happens in 1d 15hr so getting 300 in there before then will be required for sure to get that up so other stuff doesn't get capped on low safety


[03-Aug-24 09:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
guessing by the contribution numbers, but 35% safety is probably full DW


[03-Aug-24 09:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's consistent with the past few weeks too,.


[03-Aug-24 09:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also how many engineer jobs did you add Hern?


[03-Aug-24 09:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
~~Do you need any DW on griff? I just resupplied, so I can donate some from my base~~ nevermind, looks like it's already filled


[03-Aug-24 09:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah I was playing with it some to get those numbers figured out. Main issue with the SCI and ENG are low culture and education


[03-Aug-24 09:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
But they also are getting capped hard by the safety and health if you try to increase them even a bit


[03-Aug-24 09:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
None, these are my AMLs I've had for probably a year. we're negative ENG if you look at the report


[03-Aug-24 10:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
this is what we're doing right now it looks like

[03-Aug-24 10:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
requires a UNI upgrade


[03-Aug-24 10:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
ideally we'd increase the ART by 3 levels and drop the MHP, but that's super expensive


[03-Aug-24 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
There is a mixed use building that takes drinking water.


[03-Aug-24 11:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Art cafe.


[03-Aug-24 11:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's low efficiency though, I think


[03-Aug-24 11:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
what I have up there just requires the UNI to be increased, nothing else


[04-Aug-24 12:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
The upkeep cost is good on art cafe stuff, if I recall. The building cost might suck. And the planet might be big enough that the mixed use buildings don't make much of a dent


[04-Aug-24 12:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
IF anyone has OFF they can bring to the SST, that would be great


[04-Aug-24 12:30 AM] marat_sh#0000

I am gonna bring some OFF over. I see it got capped on health and  safety was pretty low, we can probably boost the techs above 70% happiness pretty easily. looks like it added like 2k tech jobs last week

@neth_havoc I'm willing to sponsor SCI immigration (missing 18)


[12-Feb-25 01:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think with happiness in the 30%s a festival 3 might be better. Lost 200 eng and 31 scientists, but added 25 from the immigration. The festival 3 would push those happinesses in the 30s to +50% then the migration out will stop.

It’s a complicated problem to tackle for sure

I have more empathy for city planners irl now

when they are lost from one planet, do they go to another planet? or do they just dissapear


[13-Apr-25 02:03 AM] evov#0000
Disappear. They get put onto colony ships and sent back to the cages hidden at the CX.

Hello guys! I’ve got a base on Griffonstone that I produce CL and NA out of.

The last weeks I could play PRUN only sporadic because of some IRL stuff. It will become better, I guess, but that time is not now.
For that reason I will not rerun for governor of Griffonstone.
@OOG Shareholder The election will start in around 10 h. Maybe there is someone of you who wants to take over?!

Both SilentReaper and Caskman had messaged me, I am happy with either of them. Caskman has a bunch of planets so I think SilentReaper is going to defer to him

Hope all is well!

My only problem with SilentReaper is that he wants to take over government for one or two terms and then hand it off. I feel like that usually ends up with them running the planet for a lot longer. But I don’t know if we have anyone else who wants to take on a big planet Iike Griff atm

It's a tough gig running one of the larger planets... there's a relatively small number of people willing to put themselves forward.


[24-Apr-25 11:35 AM] akyantor#0000
That said the pop upkeep changes should make it a little easier. Longer cycle times, so fewer refills required. 🙂


[24-Apr-25 11:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, a longer term mindset is helpful. I think caskman would take it longer term


[25-Apr-25 12:30 AM] martin1194#0000
I voted Caskman


[25-Apr-25 12:32 AM] martin1194#0000
He was using his money to make upkeep for Harmonia before I suggest that he rise the tax.
