Hello @everyone! In 20hrs our OOG 3000 will be up and ready for flight. The OOG 3000 is a ship that has 1000m^3 and 3000t carrying capacity. I will use this ship as a corporate UHaul between our most frequently flown planets and potentially other systems. With that being said there are a few things that I need to ask of you and that you need to keep in mind: 

1) Please do not post shipment offers larger than your storage capacity can hold on the arrival planet. This will result in the ship being stuck on planet until you have enough room for me to fulfill the shipment contract resulting in shipping bottlenecks. 

2) I need your help identifying the routes that are our most frequently traveled or require heavy carrying capacity to figure out the best way to utilize this ship.

3) Payment is not required to utilize the OOG 300, though tipping the pilot would be appreciated to help maintain upkeep and fuel costs. 😁

The maiden voyage will be Nike -> CX filled with LST to flood the market. Following that flight I will take into consideration your route recommendations and identify the flight needed most. If you are a producer of LST on Nike, figure out if you want it moved to the CX and how much you can hold in preparation.


[27-Apr-22 02:02 AM] yang_mills#0000
I usually have  LST to ship from Nike to the CX. When do you fly next Nike ->CX? How many t (tons) could I use?


[27-Apr-22 02:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
My usual routes:


[27-Apr-22 02:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
Phobos -> Harmonia -> Deimos ->Phobos or CX


[27-Apr-22 02:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
Phobos -> Deimos ->Nike ->CX ->Phobos


[27-Apr-22 02:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
The trip Nike ->CX is usually full with LST.


[27-Apr-22 02:06 AM] yang_mills#0000
The trip Deimos -> Nike is heavily loaded with AL, +RAT and DW.


[27-Apr-22 02:06 AM] yang_mills#0000
The trip Harmonia -> Deimos heavily loaded with RAT,DW, crops and H2O.


[27-Apr-22 02:07 AM] yang_mills#0000
The trip Deimos -> Phobos loaded with crops and H2O, sometimes heavily.


[27-Apr-22 03:16 AM] namthorn#0000
I have one that I could use done occasionally. SE-648c -> Deimos. Dropping off bulk O and TIO. Not needed frequently but would allow me to expand operations there and aid with any O-intense smelting people want to do.


[27-Apr-22 04:24 AM] rune_242#0000
I need alot of LST from nike to deimos


[27-Apr-22 04:24 AM] rune_242#0000

[27-Apr-22 07:27 AM] insensless72#0000
Used space


[27-Apr-22 07:47 AM] domicius#0000
I'll take some of that LST action at the CX :)


[27-Apr-22 11:31 AM] allocater#0000
we could pool 1000 AL together on deimos and move it to Nike once every while

The ship will fly CX -> Phobos in 6hrs and then out to 401b and 401d -> Phobos. From there ill send it back to Nike and move some more LST for everyone

[30-Apr-22 10:45 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I'm always happy to buy H, let me know when it arrives and how much is left


[01-May-22 04:18 AM] yang_mills#0000
How did you buy H? Is is sold on the LM?


[01-May-22 07:58 AM] insensless72#0000
401d through Slomes


[01-May-22 09:54 AM] yang_mills#0000
Is there space left for 500 H? That's 35 t and 500 m^3.


[01-May-22 09:55 AM] insensless72#0000
unfortunately not. I have a 2560t shipment from DLR and 440 H which is 100% capacity


[01-May-22 09:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. Then I will ship it myself.


[01-May-22 09:57 AM] insensless72#0000
I only need a small amount of this H, youre welcome to claim some


[01-May-22 09:58 AM] yang_mills#0000
I've already purchased 500 H from Slomes. I need large amounts of H for PE.


[01-May-22 09:59 AM] insensless72#0000
That is a route I can make more regularly, i could bring back 1000 at a time for you


[01-May-22 09:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
Good to know. I reprocess 24+ H per day.

The 3000 is stuck on Phobos for the time being, I'm hoping to get that resolved by this evening (for me). Once I do I will keep you posted. I believe its turning back around to the CX first

[29-May-22 04:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You mentioned having 500-600 supply and increasing, that is enough to justify a flight I think

Up for discussion: I am flying to Katoa which is in the Benten system. Do I first go to the Benten exchange and drop any items you guys might want me to take? Im going to opt not to dump LST since it is similar in price to Antares. Or, should I simply send it to Katoa, grab @yjhasaday GAL and bring it back asap to take LST to Griff?


[23-Jun-22 02:44 PM] yjhasaday#0000

[04-Jul-22 04:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is not super urgent, and there is likely going to be more TI ready by the time you get out there, so a 3000t ship is nice

Oh im aware, its painful


[17-Jul-22 05:50 PM] insensless72#0000
Im going to try and expedite the process a little bit. Departing ANT -> Nike landing in 11hrs. @Nike -> @Deimos will depart in 14hrs. Place shipping ads on Nike LM if you want anything moved that way


[18-Jul-22 10:56 AM] insensless72#0000
Nike -> Deimos landing in 9 hrs. Deimos -> Heph departing in 11


[18-Jul-22 11:09 AM] churavis#0000
It's there any space on the Deimos -> Heph run?


[18-Jul-22 11:09 AM] insensless72#0000
There should be, how much do you need moved?


[18-Jul-22 11:10 AM] insensless72#0000

If you can't take them right now then don't worry about it, they're not super urgent


[18-Jul-22 11:24 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I’d buy a bit of LST and ship it if possible


[18-Jul-22 11:32 AM] churavis#0000
I believe he's already left Nike but I've got LST on Hephaestus if you're desperate


[18-Jul-22 11:50 AM] jackinabox86#0000

[18-Jul-22 11:50 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm ok


[18-Jul-22 12:20 PM] insensless72#0000
Once I make my way back Deimos -> Nike I can bring LST to Deimos if it's needed


[18-Jul-22 12:28 PM] jackinabox86#0000
No rush.  I need to go to Nike anyway and my usage is pretty light

Is there a plan for where ol' Bucey is going next?


[04-Aug-22 11:42 AM] insensless72#0000
Nope, you need it somewhere in particular?


[04-Aug-22 11:44 AM] churavis#0000
I would like to commission it to take FE, and STL from Antares II b to the CX to take advantage of the recent increase in prices there. If there's enough corp demand we could stop by Deimos as well but I already have a shipment of FE on its way.


[04-Aug-22 11:45 AM] churavis#0000
I have enough to use the max tonnage


[04-Aug-22 11:45 AM] insensless72#0000
