@everyone we will put forward @colerror to run as governor of Nike. The election will start whenever we build the ADM, but that also means we need to start supplying Nike infrastructure at tha time.


[12-Jan-22 08:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, we will need to rally the OOG vote with all 7 of our Nike bases üòà


[12-Jan-22 08:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000 (pinned)
Here are the upkeep screens for the 3 existing Planet Infrastructure projects on Nike:

and additionally, the chamber of global commerce (COGC)

[12-Jan-22 08:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000 (pinned)
the COGC is variable. But currently the sum totals are:

```
125 DW (3 days)
54 RAT (10 days)
108 PE (10 days)
108 MCG (10 days)
60 OFF (3 days)*
30 SUN (10 days)
100 TUB (10 days)**
50 SOI (10 days)
5 DEC (10 days)**
10 PFE (3 days)**
30 FOD (3 days)**
```


[12-Jan-22 08:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
items with `*` are currently unsupplied


[12-Jan-22 09:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with 1-2 CHP and some shiploads of BRM, the PFE and SOI could be covered. I am willing to do this part with my chemistry base on Phobos.


[12-Jan-22 09:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I already do regular shipments from phobos to Nike


[12-Jan-22 09:57 PM] colerror#0000
I was planning on setting CHP up on Nike anyway, so not a huge problem there


[12-Jan-22 09:58 PM] colerror#0000
Though I also feel like there's probably a pretty big differential between import and export weight on Nike, so shipping in shouldn't be a huge problem


[12-Jan-22 10:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BMP will also be needed for MCG, PE, OFF and SUN


[12-Jan-22 10:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am getting a manufacturing base next on A1C, so this is another thing I can do if @colerror prefers the CHP work

PE and MCG I can provide myself üôÇ rest is hard for me to produce


[13-Jan-22 06:46 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I can make and ship in SUN and OFF as long as I get EPO. MCG and PE is also a can do for me.


[13-Jan-22 07:02 AM] spatial_piano#0000
STR as well, for the INF.


[13-Jan-22 11:23 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano do you have BMP on Nike?


[13-Jan-22 11:23 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I know you mainly have them on Phobos


[13-Jan-22 11:24 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh, you said ‚Äúship in‚Äù. I am happy to provide free EPO on Phobos for this purpose


[13-Jan-22 06:13 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[16-Jan-22 03:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone We are now ‚Äúpublic‚Äù with our election plans. IMPORTANT: please refer all requests for information regarding the campaign (or OOG on Nike) to this channel.


[16-Jan-22 03:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
information can work for us, and be used against us when it comes to these elections.

@dasefx1 how difficult is it to produce the electronics for Planetary Broadcasting Hub?


[17-Jan-22 02:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it needs some APF work

[17-Jan-22 02:10 PM] dasefx1#0000
let me check


[17-Jan-22 02:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
ADS is easy, I can produce. most difficult is waiting for OS, as only 23% of engineers I had now


[17-Jan-22 02:13 PM] dasefx1#0000
COM is more easier, only I need to wait for first LI batch from gazprom


[17-Jan-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This could be a good project on Nike


[17-Jan-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
similar scope to HQ I think


[17-Jan-22 02:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
it can be ready in 1.5-2 weeks


[17-Jan-22 02:15 PM] dasefx1#0000
true üòâ more difficult will be to contribute food for it üôÇ


[17-Jan-22 02:16 PM] dasefx1#0000
if you want let me know üôÇ and I will start production


[17-Jan-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
true the consumables look bad


[17-Jan-22 02:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In the first month we can work on upgrading and stocking existing buildings..


[17-Jan-22 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think we could get 60% of consumables for a PBH with some planning


[17-Jan-22 02:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
but do we need it ? like PP4 I use only with technics and it is fine üòâ


[17-Jan-22 02:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
100% efficient with zero Engineers


[17-Jan-22 02:21 PM] dasefx1#0000
thanks to experts, cogc, and corp hq


[17-Jan-22 02:27 PM] colerror#0000
I think the idea is to improve the planet for the folks that aren't us, so they keep electing us


[17-Jan-22 02:28 PM] dasefx1#0000
i think low taxes and cheaper LM will solve problem üôÇ


[17-Jan-22 02:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
education will support technician population by educating settlers


[17-Jan-22 02:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also we can still support pioneer and settler population by doing BFAB upgrades to level 2 on the existing buildings


[17-Jan-22 02:29 PM] dasefx1#0000
Technicians: Health, Safety and Comfort


[17-Jan-22 02:29 PM] dasefx1#0000
and PBH is Provides a small amount of culture and education.


[17-Jan-22 02:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, i see. This education is not related to educating workforce during the population reports?


[17-Jan-22 02:31 PM] dasefx1#0000
eduction is only for Scientists

we need to add more food


[17-Jan-22 02:31 PM] dasefx1#0000

I see. Thanks for elaborating here


[17-Jan-22 03:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 seems we have added manufacturing capacity now, but a bigger deficit of food/carbon. I can get a harmonia base instead to help with this


[17-Jan-22 04:00 PM] kharadan#0000
I will have a new base on Harmonia by the end of this week, but it will take some more time before some food will come from that

@everyone ^^ FIO built?


[26-Jan-22 06:23 PM] colerror#0000
The Deimos one was "default"


[26-Jan-22 06:23 PM] colerror#0000
Pretty sure at least


[26-Jan-22 06:24 PM] insensless72#0000
I think the default was ZV-307c


[26-Jan-22 06:25 PM] colerror#0000
I thought each CX had one in-system, but I could be wrong


[26-Jan-22 06:26 PM] insensless72#0000
They did, ZV-307c is Antares and uncontrolled


[26-Jan-22 06:26 PM] insensless72#0000
Deimos operator is FIO-Antares


[26-Jan-22 06:26 PM] colerror#0000
Ah, not sure then


[26-Jan-22 06:26 PM] insensless72#0000
Just means more competition in the race for more ships


[26-Jan-22 06:27 PM] insensless72#0000
In the long run


[26-Jan-22 06:30 PM] megasaberexe#0000
So wait what does this mean? We are going to build ships or something?


[26-Jan-22 06:35 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes, eventually we will have the ability to build FTL ships, for now @dasefx1 Just built the first STL ship (which means its stuck in Antares I)


[26-Jan-22 06:47 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Whoa thats amazing! This is one for the history books!


[26-Jan-22 06:59 PM] colerror#0000
There seems to have been a single FTL ship built thus far


[26-Jan-22 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes by SNF


[26-Jan-22 08:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Bob industries actually built the first ship months ago, in Antares I and with no FTL


[29-Jan-22 05:00 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@colerror I have 120 TUBs on nike if you ever need them.


[29-Jan-22 05:02 PM] colerror#0000
The Infirmary goes through something like 100 every 3 days


[29-Jan-22 05:02 PM] colerror#0000
If you want to apply them, let me know and I'll mark them off on the ledger


[29-Jan-22 05:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay I can put them in now @colerror


[29-Jan-22 05:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I have the tab open and such


[29-Jan-22 05:07 PM] colerror#0000
Ok, throw them in. I've been pricing everything at "last AI1 sell price"


[29-Jan-22 05:07 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay done, also what do you mean "last AL1 sell price"?


[29-Jan-22 05:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so this is 1000 TUB per month ü§î


[29-Jan-22 05:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i suppose its not terrible if we are undersupplied, since other consumables are fully supplied.


[29-Jan-22 05:08 PM] colerror#0000
300 TUB/month

governor üôÇ let me donate migration üòâ we can do like rain said, I think it is better. List 1 DW for amount needed and I will fullfill


[10-Feb-22 09:17 AM] dasefx1#0000
also I upgraded SST on nike, so we can add less and had same result


[10-Feb-22 09:18 AM] dasefx1#0000
so if we adding DW and OFF, from next change we can add only OFF or DW


[10-Feb-22 09:18 AM] dasefx1#0000
and we should have same results

Announcement to @deleted-role s,

Our political strategy has shifted now that Sea of Dirac is resigning as governor of Phobos. OOG's current hold on the Nike governorship is not contested, regardless of which member holds the position.

The opportunity to govern @Phobos  is too good to pass up, so we will put forth our very own @colerror  as a candidate for the governorship. ColErr has already proven himself capable of winning an election on a new planet as the public face of our corporation, and has his original base on Phobos. We believe that he is the best candidate for the job.

Over the past year, OOG has built up significant good will in the Antares region. With over 10 guaranteed votes on Phobos, and a candidate with a history of governing Antares area planets, I think ColErr stands a good chance to win the election.

In the worst case,  we will still retain governorship over Nike and continue our operations as normal.

With this, I present to you @colerror  as the future governor of @Phobos, and request that every member of OOG with a base on Phobos vote in favor in the upcoming election.

Additionally, I put myself forward as the governor of @Nike in the absence of Colonel Error, and request that everyone based on Nike to vote in favor, so we retain control of our HQ planet.

If anyone would prefer to take this responsibility, please say so now. Otherwise, I am happy to take the reins and allow ColErr to pursue the more difficult and higher-risk situation that is Phobos governance üòÑ

Stay tuned!

@colerror Is crushing the competition on Phobos!
With the Phobos election 22hrs away from it's conclusion id like to point a couple things out:
1) As a corporation, we will now be in control of 2 planets, which (to my knowledge) makes us one of the larger corps in Antares. 
2) Governing 2 planets means that we will have to make sure to pay attention to contributions for infrastructure buildings and CoGC as a collective.  
3) To help lighten the load on our governors, I have added #governance-and-popi-mats. As you make contributions toward buildings on either Phobos or Deimos, make sure you post that you have done so. Alternatively, governors, if you notice there is a building in need of contributions / If you need income for programs on either planet to draw workforce you can post it there. 

New players, if you have no idea what ^^^ is, reach out to me and I will fill you in on planetary infrastructure mechanics.

Im looking forward to the potential (and dividends) our near future holds!

on point 2, I'd imagine Phobos popi to be rather expensive. Do we have any rough figures on weekly cost?


[25-Mar-22 05:19 PM] insensless72#0000
Fully stocking infrastructure buildings would be a huge expense which isnt really necessary. There are several products that can be contributed to several of the buildings that are already active. DW, TUB, SOI, DEC for example all can be contributed to multiple buildings. Really what needs to happen is we make sure that we keep 1 or 2 items per building stocked, since they dont really need to be fully stocked. The buildings like University and Art Gallery will be more difficult..


[25-Mar-22 05:20 PM] insensless72#0000
That being said, anyone on planet can contribute to those so it doesnt completely fall on us as a corp. There are several players on Phobos that contribute and are not in corp so hopefully that continues


[25-Mar-22 06:02 PM] namthorn#0000

Hello ! I tried to understand why the happiness of ENG and SCI on Phobos crushed to one digits with the last POPR (number 58). It was slowly eroding since report 53, but it took a big hit with the last report. So I had to dig a bit into how happiness works in PrUn. For this I used the following guide : https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/
Population Infrastructure - PrUn Community Derived Information
Community derived data & formulas from the game Prosperous Universe
Below I quote what is written there.
Population Happiness

There are two types of happiness, True Happiness and Averaged Happiness. For this document, whenever Happiness is used on its own, it refers to Averaged Happiness. The Averaged Happiness is the value displayed in the game.
Averaging Happiness

The happiness displayed is the weighted average of the True Happiness of the previous 5 weeks. The weights are, going from the previous week to 5 weeks ago: 0.4, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05

H = 0.4 * h0 + 0.25 * h1 + 0.2 * h2 + 0.1 * h3 + 0.05 * h4
Missing Data

When not all 5 weeks are available to average, such as in the first 4 weeks since a planet‚Äôs settlement, the missing terms are ignored and the final result is divided by the sum of the weights that were counted.
True Happiness

True (unaveraged) happiness is affected by need fulfillment, unemployment, and explorer‚Äôs grace. It is capped between 0 and 1. In general, it follows this formula:

h = Weighted Sum of Need Fulfillment + Explorer's Grace - Unemployment
End quote.

[12-Apr-22 01:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
The important thing is that there are two kinds of happiness. The true happiness depends on the unemployment/open jobs and the need fulfilment. It is displayed nowhere. It's a hidden variable. Then there is the average happiness that is actually displayed. It's a weighted average of the true happiness over 5 weeks. So there is an inertia in this happiness as it depends on several past weeks.

On top of that, there are now the governor's programs that add a constant value to the average happiness. Phobos had such programs (Planetary festivities III) for the POPR 55 and 57.

From this data one can infer the hidden true happiness. Let's take the example of SCI. I assumed that up to and including POPR 52, the true happiness was, just as the average happiness, around 90 percent. From this I got that on POPR 53, the true happiness was about 67 percent, and starting from POPR 54 it crushed to one digits, like almost 0. Because of the way the average happiness is computed, we have seen the full effect of this only with the last POPR 58. But the ¬´ fundamentals ¬ª (true happiness) were already disastrous since POPR 54. So what happened there ?

POPR 53 is exactly when Advanced education program III has been activated. Due to it, the number of SCI exploded from 226 to 785. So starting from the next POPR 54, there was a very high unemployment for SCI (74,5 percent). It crushed the hidden true happiness to one digits already on that week. On top of that, the existing infrastructure might have been insufficient for such a high number of SCI, but I don't know this for sure.

[12-Apr-22 01:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
This also means that if the true happiness goes up again, the average happiness will remain bad for several weeks because of the inertia, and will rise only progressively.

means there's a hidden cost to these OP government programs after all


[12-Apr-22 04:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, there are hidden costs. Tier III Advanced Education program was a complete overkill. At its peak, the number of SCI was 818, and only 260 jobs for them. A lower tier Advanced Education program would have been enough, would have created less problems, and would have cost less money.


[13-Apr-22 04:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
People on Phobos UFO are really unhappy with the management of our corp. It is true that some buildings were not properly maintained, like the Wildlife parks. On top of that we have an absentee governor who cannot enact a Festival program for the happiness. I think our corp will lose Phobos on the next election.


[13-Apr-22 04:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape You should publicly announce the situation with the governor. Because everyone is requesting a governor program for happiness.

Here are some conclusions for Phobos. To get 100 percent safety one needs to fully upkeep the safety stations, with all 3 mats.


[15-Apr-22 05:24 AM] yang_mills#0000
To get 100 % Health on needs to fully upkeep the infirmary with all 3 mats. Currently it is supplied with only 2 mats. TUBs are missing.


[15-Apr-22 05:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
To get 90+% Comfort, one needs to supply the parks with 4 out of 5 mats, like DW, FOD, PFE and SOI. Currently we miss FOD.


[15-Apr-22 05:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
To get 90+% Culture, one needs to supply the art gallery with 3 out of 4 mats. Currently there are no supplies at all for ART and this needs to be fixed.


[15-Apr-22 05:28 AM] allocater#0000
but do we have to achieve 90%+ if there are so many unemployed?


[15-Apr-22 05:29 AM] yang_mills#0000
To get 90+% Education, we only need to supply the UNIs with 1 material out of 6, and don't need to supply the Library at all. However, the Education is also used for the promotion of lower tier pops, and I don't know yet how does it work exactly.


[15-Apr-22 05:31 AM] yang_mills#0000
This is a political decision. I only gave the raw numbers. Then we have to decide what level of fulfilment we aim at and adjust the upkeep according to this.

[15-Apr-22 05:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
In any case we should bring some supplies for the art gallery. Else there will be a disaster for the number of ENG and SCI on the next POPR.


[15-Apr-22 05:37 AM] yang_mills#0000
Actually the number of ENG and SCI on Phobos is already lower than the number of jobs. The unemployment displayed on the last POPR is actually the unemployment during the last week.

üò≤

A POPR displays the unemployment, the happiness and the need fulfilment for the week that has ended, and displays the population for the week that has started. Therefore there might be a confusion.


[15-Apr-22 05:43 AM] yang_mills#0000
Indeed, one can check that on Phobos the reserve of ENG and SCI a company can use for a new production line is only 1 of each. This means that there are less pops than jobs.


[15-Apr-22 05:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
Like want to build an SPF? Only 1 ENG and 1 SCI available for it.


[15-Apr-22 05:47 AM] allocater#0000
I vote for tax increases, eng and sci should pay for their stuff üòÑ


[15-Apr-22 05:47 AM] yang_mills#0000

[15-Apr-22 05:50 AM] namthorn#0000

[15-Apr-22 05:50 AM] yang_mills#0000
Does anyone have an EDM on Phobos to produce there MHP and HOG for the upkeep?


[15-Apr-22 05:52 AM] allocater#0000
I think there is no EDM in the entire corp


[15-Apr-22 05:52 AM] yang_mills#0000
Too bad.


[15-Apr-22 05:53 AM] allocater#0000
ah there is 2 EDM on some wilderness planet @domicius üòÑ


[15-Apr-22 05:54 AM] yang_mills#0000
We need to create supply lines for upkeeping Phobos. Supply lines for FOD, for PFE, for SOI, for MHP and HOG, etc.


[15-Apr-22 05:55 AM] allocater#0000
FOD I can do


[15-Apr-22 05:55 AM] allocater#0000
MHP and HOG too if I build EDM


[15-Apr-22 05:55 AM] yang_mills#0000
I could run an EDM on Phobos, but right now I don't have the room. I think I will demolish my 2 SME on Phobos in one week from now. This will free space.


[15-Apr-22 05:55 AM] namthorn#0000
PFE I can make if i get a steady supply of BRM. @domicius do you mine any on KI-840c?


[15-Apr-22 05:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
Better you build the EDM.


[15-Apr-22 05:56 AM] yang_mills#0000
But then we also need the inputs for the EDM.


[15-Apr-22 05:57 AM] namthorn#0000
yea need some manufacturing capability to feed the EDM


[15-Apr-22 05:58 AM] yang_mills#0000
Some inputs require higher tier buildings than the EDM itself.


[15-Apr-22 05:58 AM] namthorn#0000
might just be easier ot buy the MHP/HOG


[15-Apr-22 05:58 AM] namthorn#0000
raise taxes on higher pops to cover it


[15-Apr-22 05:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
It's very expensive on the CX, and low supply there.


[15-Apr-22 06:00 AM] yang_mills#0000
To feed the EDM, we would need SCA, CLR and FS.


[15-Apr-22 06:00 AM] yang_mills#0000
And copper and gold.


[15-Apr-22 06:00 AM] namthorn#0000
low supply there but perhaps people are running edm already on world


[15-Apr-22 06:01 AM] namthorn#0000

[15-Apr-22 06:02 AM] allocater#0000
MHP is just electronics I already have.

HOG needs DCS and NG I dont have


[15-Apr-22 06:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
MHP and HOG are not sold on any CX other than ANT. Mumzhar and AceBaron produce these things. Perhaps we could reach an agreement with them and buy cheaper from them.

[15-Apr-22 06:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
We could also supply UTS instead. It doesn't look complicated to produce. It's a metallurgy thing. Does anyone have an FS on Deimos?


[15-Apr-22 06:06 AM] yang_mills#0000
Also DEC should be easy for people of Griffonstone who have Epoxy and polymer plants. So perhaps UTS and DEC is the easiest option for our corporation.


[15-Apr-22 06:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps @namthorn or @bitcoin_ape could produce DEC.


[15-Apr-22 06:12 AM] yang_mills#0000
And @insensless72 or @allocater could produce UTS?


[15-Apr-22 06:15 AM] yang_mills#0000
Supplying 20 DEC and 20 UTS every 10 days looks easier than supplying 10 MPH and 10 HOG every 3 days.


[15-Apr-22 06:32 AM] namthorn#0000
20 dec is a lot of prod time


[15-Apr-22 06:35 AM] allocater#0000
yes I can do UTS, I have FS on Heph


[15-Apr-22 06:36 AM] namthorn#0000
thats 1400 EPO & 3k PG which is almost my entire weekly production, on the market that's close to 200k worth of goods.


[15-Apr-22 06:37 AM] allocater#0000
20 UTS are 44k


[15-Apr-22 07:26 AM] insensless72#0000
I can make UTS when demand for FET calms down. For now I have to dedicate 100% of FE to ASMs. It will also ne possible for me to produce more once this WCB ship is done and I can haul more than 60 FE off 401b at a time


[15-Apr-22 07:33 AM] namthorn#0000
imo the HOG or MHP make more financial sense to buy over making the DEC. ~30k every 3 days vs ~200k every 10. UTS would make sense if we can, even if it's not insenseless that makes them, there's a FEO tap next door to deimos.


[15-Apr-22 07:47 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ok, then we provide UTS and either HOG or MHP.


[15-Apr-22 07:49 AM] yang_mills#0000
Both HOG and MHP look complicated to produce: require many steps and TEC level production units.


[15-Apr-22 07:49 AM] yang_mills#0000
There is more HOG on CX than MPH.


[15-Apr-22 07:52 AM] yang_mills#0000
30K every 3 days doesn't look that bad. But perhaps we could negotiate a better price for HOG with Mumzhar. Does anyone know him well enough?


[15-Apr-22 07:57 AM] yang_mills#0000
This would be great. We would need 20 UTS every 10 days.


[15-Apr-22 07:57 AM] yang_mills#0000
You can manufacture more and it will be put into the reserve.


[15-Apr-22 07:59 AM] insensless72#0000
I dont know him well per say but we do a lot of business. Mumzhar is OG so something could probably be worked out


[15-Apr-22 08:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
Great. Then perhaps you could ask him for a discount on HOG. We would need 10 HOG every 3 days for the Art Gallery on Phobos. I don't think we need to maintain the Library.


[15-Apr-22 08:06 AM] namthorn#0000
there's 70 odd on the CX, if you wanna put up a golden sell order on deimos I can give you 30k for the first load.


[15-Apr-22 08:08 AM] allocater#0000
at current FE prices of 500, that would be 3400 per UTS ü§î


[15-Apr-22 08:11 AM] namthorn#0000
that's really just due to a lack of smelter outputs in general on the CX atm, i'm sure we have capacity to smelt FE. I certainly do, just need to find time to get a FEO shipment or two in

[15-Apr-22 09:55 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

family support III?


[22-Apr-22 04:27 PM] yang_mills#0000
I don't know, @bitcoin_ape is the governor. Right now Phobos loses ENG and SCI. At the same time their happiness has increased and will increase further because there is no unemployment. To the contrary, unfulfilled jobs. Perhaps an education program would make sense. Maybe not tier III, as it will be an overshoot again.


[22-Apr-22 04:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
Is it a joke? Ha-ha!


[22-Apr-22 04:29 PM] insensless72#0000
Pioneers, settlers, and techs are all sitting at 30%+ unemplyoment, family support III would pull 20% for all three right?

Soooooo back to your education recommendation üòÇ


[22-Apr-22 04:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
A festivities program is the most safe option. With education one can overshoot, get too many ENG and SCI, or decrease too much the numbers of lower tier pops through social promotion. Then the risk is to get a shortage of PIOs, which would be disastrous for new players.


[22-Apr-22 04:38 PM] insensless72#0000
Did the POPR hit on the same day as the Steam release?


[22-Apr-22 04:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, but it displays the date for the past week.


[22-Apr-22 04:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
We don't know yet how many pops we got after the release. Nor do we know the corresponding happiness and unemployment rate.


[22-Apr-22 04:42 PM] namthorn#0000
im curious as to how family support works


[22-Apr-22 04:42 PM] namthorn#0000
does it add a 1.2x multiplier to whatever rate you woudl have had?


[22-Apr-22 04:43 PM] insensless72#0000
Thats probably best, that way we get a better picture 7 days in instead of 2 or 3. festivities would be smart

I am curious. Does the game provide more accounting data to governors? For instance, how much taxes paid by population tier? This could be a useful information. One could compare taxes paid by population tier with the cost of POPI.


[22-Apr-22 05:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No, no extra info


[23-Apr-22 10:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I was looking at the numbers on Phobos and I think its actually better to upgrade the park vs. the infirmary right now. However, the park is more expensive due to 9 HAB


[23-Apr-22 11:41 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, health is also partly generated by the bases. Not the comfort.

[24-Apr-22 05:17 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ideally we would also like to keep some plots on Phobos unoccupied, so as people could come there for the electronics. Perhaps in a couple of weeks the problem will solve itself, if many players quit the game. But it might also get worse.


[24-Apr-22 05:24 PM] yang_mills#0000
The problem with electronics is that it's hard to make profit out of it if one relies only on the CX. Because many outputs and many inputs there are simply not exchanged on the CX. One has to be integrated in a network of suppliers and customers. From what I know only the NCS from CLR is both easy to produce and sell. There is also the SCN in EDM, if one menages to buy or produce CU. Electronics is imo the least obvious economical branch for new players.


[24-Apr-22 05:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is because it is not present in tier 1, and like you said requires complicated integrations that are basically too expensive for a starter.


[24-Apr-22 05:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I tried to make it exceptionally clear that these are temporary, and to fund emergency infrastructure if necessary. Depending on POPR report, and future pioneer populations


[27-Apr-22 04:13 AM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape Here is an updated spreadsheet for POPI on Phobos. Health is essentially covered by the bases. Safety is Ok. Education is fully covered if we provide only 2 out of 6 consumables for UNI, and don't even bother to upkeep LIB. Our weak spots are Comfort and Culture, and those 2 will cap the Education. With 3 consumables out of 4 for ART we cover only 58% of culture. But actually as of now we provide less upkeep than that for ART. With 4 consumables out of 5 for PAR we cover only 57% of Comfort. Again, our upkeep of PAR has not always been consistent.

@bitcoin_ape you wrote in the game chat that you queued and Education III program. Could you rather do an Education II program? Because with Education III we will again have too many engineers and scientists. There will be a high unemployment and they will start being unhappy. I think Education II is more than enough.


[08-May-22 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is already queued. previously i had this thought, but i would prefer that we overshoot on the engineer and scientists at this point, while we still have a large base of pioneers and settlers to educate out of


[08-May-22 02:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Drones are made primarily for cash, but at the point where you have completed drones you could choose to donate some


[11-May-22 01:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
which infrastructure needs drones as a consumable? i dont think we have any of these

sdp only i think


[11-May-22 01:48 PM] allocater#0000
maybe it's badly balanced, so that selling drone for 70k+ and buying other consumables is better than donating the drone

I would be happy to delegate phobos governorship internally, though. I dont have a problem with staying here, but im not attached to it and cant really put a huge amount of time in since i am so busy


[14-May-22 12:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
@bitcoin_ape @allocater I looked into the numbers to determine whether it is better to upgrade PAR (Comfort) and ART (Culture) separately, or build one or several Art Cafes (ACA, Comfort + Culture). From an upkeep perspective an ACA is not that awesome. Out of 6 consumables required by an ACA, 2 are easy: DW and GL. A 3rd one, OLF is about the same difficulty as providing SOI or PFE to the Wildlife Park (PAR). The other 3, COF, VIT and DEC are way too difficult/expensive, and we would probably never supply it.


[14-May-22 12:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
Sorry, here is an update of the previous post. Upkeep per value is about the same for PAR and ACA. Upkeep per value is about 50-60 percent more expensive for ART than for ACA. But then, PAR and ART have the advantage of being specific (Comfort or Culture, not both), and therefore more easily adjusted to our needs. On top of that, constructing a new ACA requires Rfabs, while upgrading PAR requires Bfabs, and upgrading ART requires Lfabs.


[14-May-22 12:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would recommend to upgrade PAR and ART separately.


[14-May-22 01:23 PM] namthorn#0000
worth pointing out that the "mixed" buildings provide less overall too


[14-May-22 01:24 PM] namthorn#0000
1k each of the two yields compared to 2.5k of one yield for the small -yielding infrastructure buildings


[14-May-22 01:24 PM] namthorn#0000
(when fully stocked)


[14-May-22 01:25 PM] namthorn#0000
so you'd get more from 1/2 stocking a PAR + ART than fully stocking the ACA


[14-May-22 01:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
This has been increased. Now a mixed building provides 1,5K of each.


[14-May-22 01:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
You get more from a fully stocked ACA than from 1/2 stocked PAR+ART. What one has to compare is the cost for providing upkeep.


[14-May-22 01:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
Providing 50 DW every 3 days to PAR generates 500 Comfort. Providing 50 DW every 3 days to ACA generates 250 Comfort + 250 Culture. Same value here.


[14-May-22 01:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
Providing 30 FOD every 3 days to PAR generates 500 Comfort. Providing 30 GL every 3 days to ACA generates 250 Comfort + 250 Culture. Same value. For the cost, FOD and GL are about the same price. GL is still easier to produce imo.


[14-May-22 01:43 PM] yang_mills#0000
But then, one can realistically supply 4 (out of 5) different mats to PAR, and get 2000 Comfort from one PAR. In comparison, one can realistically supply only 3 (out of 6) mats to ACA, and get only 750 Comfort + 750 Culture from one ACA.


[14-May-22 01:45 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also we can supply 3 out of 4 mats to ART and get 1875 Culture from this. Although each individual upkeep position for ART is more expensive then the cheapest two positions for ACA.


[14-May-22 04:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this makes sense. ACA seemed like a good way to put RFABs to use if we are trying to do that

I don't think any planet pays enough taxes to keep it running. All run on donations.


[09-Jun-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with minimal upkeep, pioneers/settler only, and moderate-high tax, it could be done


[09-Jun-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but yea in practice it is a money sink to maintain a high tech planet


[09-Jun-22 01:53 PM] insensless72#0000
With a corp of 3 or 4 it could be. Tax rev split 21ways though it isnt


[09-Jun-22 01:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh yea the split ruins it in practice, but money moves very easily in corp


[09-Jun-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
theoretically, ignoring the split, it is a question of net tax revenue in vs net corp expenditure to maintain that planet


[09-Jun-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and it is a net loss. We havent cranked taxes on any of the planets


[09-Jun-22 01:56 PM] insensless72#0000

[09-Jun-22 02:00 PM] churavis#0000
Harmonia is an Agriculture planet so I don't see it ever needing the upkeep for engineers or scientists, maybe a few technicians. Unless you have plans to turn it into a Food Industries planet, the upkeep shouldn't be super expensive.

[09-Jun-22 02:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
So far Mumzhar spent resources only on the COGC. He didn't even supply the SST and INF. There is no PAR on Harmonia, and only 90 technicians.


[09-Jun-22 02:08 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah and we lost PIO in the last pop report, that makes me nervous as we have only 11.9% unemployment for them now and will likely lose more on the next one.


[09-Jun-22 02:09 PM] insensless72#0000
By my last count we have 12 votes on Harmonia


[09-Jun-22 02:14 PM] yang_mills#0000
The upkeep will end up costing more than the income from taxes though.


[09-Jun-22 02:19 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah thats the case with every planet currently. That has more to do with our corporate structure than anything though


[09-Jun-22 02:20 PM] churavis#0000

@yang_mills Are you thinking about running?


[10-Jun-22 11:29 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, I think I will run for Harmonia. But I will need the corp support for supplying Harmonia. On top of the COGC, I will supply the upkeep mats for the safety station, and perhaps run some gov programs. The goal here is to stop the loss of PIOs. Essentially I will create an upkeep fund, will put there 300K AIC from my own pocket and ask the corp for 200K AIC. That's 500K AIC in total and I hope it will be enough for some time. I will also request EPO and C from the corp to produce OFF and SUN.


[10-Jun-22 11:30 AM] yang_mills#0000
If I get elected on Harmonia, I will stop managing the upkeep fund for Phobos and return to @bitcoin_ape the remaining money (290K AIC as of now), as well as the mats I keep in reserve for Phobos (FOD, UTS, RAT and DW). I will continue manufacturing MHP and HOG for Phobos ART.

[10-Jun-22 11:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
The priority on Harmonia is of course the COGC. Then something has also to be done for the PIOs, as their numbers decrease and their unemployment is not that high, at 11,9%. Therefore I will provide some supplies to the safety station and perhaps run a couple of gov programs. I won't increase the taxes during my first term, but this is likely to occur during my second term if I get reelected.


[10-Jun-22 11:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
Also a decision has to be made whether Harmonia needs more technicians. They are needed for ORC and IVP. This is something to be discussed with the big players on Harmonia, whether they want to expand into TEC tier.

Last pop report on Deimos? And frankly no im not confident.. but thats what will make this one fun


[06-Jul-22 08:19 PM] insensless72#0000
I think this has the potential to show us how other players feel about us outside of the corp. Bobemor has 6 terms under his belt, if we manage to overthrow him we will definitely need outside support, especially since he is connected with FIO

[07-Jul-22 04:32 PM] namthorn#0000
i doubt it. to supply the popi with the current level of taxation is a net negative for the corp, but we have a big bank and sometimes the influence is more alluring.


[07-Jul-22 04:33 PM] namthorn#0000

I whole heartedly believe a debate between Bobemor and I would end very badly for me lol. Dude is good at what he does, while im jumping in feet first


[08-Jul-22 05:39 PM] insensless72#0000
That being said, he timed that comment very well and had players withhold votes to see what the gen pop would do. Its going to force me to respond but I have little to counter with if hes running on an independent Deimos


[08-Jul-22 05:40 PM] churavis#0000
He's part of a corp too so he's not really independent either


[08-Jul-22 05:41 PM] churavis#0000
Also, how is it fair that people not receiving the tax dividend be expected to contribute to infrastructure?


[08-Jul-22 05:44 PM] insensless72#0000
I dont think hes claiming they are. He claims that through collaboration between planets and corporations Deimos has grown and the tax rev went to the shipyard and POPI


[08-Jul-22 05:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think you just have to be clear about the issue with the population. That‚Äôs really the only argument against him. OOG planets grow quickly and sustainably, and we can‚Äôt afford to take risks with the key regional planet: Deimos


[08-Jul-22 06:11 PM] domicius#0000
Think about this though - you have to contest now, so that's even if you lose your you can win next time. And focus on plans for the future, and the benefits you'll bring... Never argue on the opponent's position.


[08-Jul-22 06:32 PM] namthorn#0000
He has done a decent job outside of a couple of hiccups. Maybe bring those up? Few weeks of reduced profits because of reckless government programs? üòõ


[08-Jul-22 06:33 PM] namthorn#0000
I remember a lot of new players got quite annoyed they couldn't hire in more pioneers because all the surplus either left or educated a couple of times.

This is what I have brainstormed so far


[08-Jul-22 06:36 PM] insensless72#0000
Bobemor offers an independent Deimos that is funded by your revenue and managed by him. I offer you a Deimos that is funded by your tax revenue along with our corporate revenue and is backed up with all of our existing supply chains, ensuring current POPI and any future expansion needed. Allow me, and OOG to do the heavy lifting that is in Deimos‚Äô best interest as a whole.


[08-Jul-22 06:38 PM] insensless72#0000
Im trying to aviod going to jabs because he does have more connections with large players and corps than I do. Im also trying to avoid too many future promises due to the fact that other than population growth, there really isnt anything else we can do in the future on Deimos

I think the best bet is to go for the born-and-bred Antares line. FIOC ain't from around these parts. OOG helped build up the sector from it's infancy


[08-Jul-22 06:42 PM] namthorn#0000
well, the founders did anyway


[08-Jul-22 06:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If he has these vaunted connections, he wins and none of this matters.  We have to play as if he doesn't and convince people, using the past hiccups as an example.


[08-Jul-22 06:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
if nothing else, make him commit to running the planet better and if he fails in that, we can take him down next time


[08-Jul-22 06:54 PM] namthorn#0000
I think some core pledges would be a good idea. Doesn't need to be outlandish, but there needs to be some highlight on what we can do that he can't and that should be front and center. I think the corp revenue to bolster the taxes is a good start on that front.


[08-Jul-22 06:57 PM] insensless72#0000
Bobemor offers an independent Deimos that is funded by your revenue and managed by him.

Allow me, and OOG to do the heavy lifting that is in Deimos‚Äô best interest as a whole. A vote for me ensures the resources needed for quick and stable growth, along with the experience of governing not only 1 planet, but many planets over a large portion of our beloved Antares system.

What im posting in game


[08-Jul-22 06:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think this is a pretty good line. Also it can appeal to what a lot of independent players may want, the ability to climb into higher tier goods. Plus something about trying to locally source upkeep items, so local voters can profit from selling upkeep items there


[08-Jul-22 06:58 PM] archielvahr#0000

About 2 per SME per day, depending on efficiency and recipe


[08-Jul-22 08:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It‚Äôs roughly 1.8 sme to ext. the income from the ext isn‚Äôt high and the cx has a lot of ore supply. I thought about going extraction only and it didn‚Äôt seem worth it


[08-Jul-22 08:13 PM] exeler#0000
I got 4 INC burning the fast recipe 24/7 on Harmonia. 16xC every 8hrs or so for roughly 64C/d. So 2C/d X 29 SME for >60C/d seems almost a perfect match?

[09-Jul-22 01:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there are unemployed technicians, but open engineer jobs. comfort is very poor, and education is not there..


[09-Jul-22 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with that said, technicans are likely doing the majority of the high tech work on that planet. The pioneers are much more important

[09-Jul-22 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

I will not be contesting this election cycle


[07-Aug-22 06:25 PM] insensless72#0000
@OOG Shareholder With DLR's departure from PrUn, there are several major decisions to be made. Up until this point, DLR was our acting lead of OOG, active in making most major decisions and on goings within corp. With this position vacant we have to decide how corporate structure should proceed, and who (if anyone) will be governor of Phobos. 

1) Do we want to elect a new lead for corp? (which I will assign the @CEO role to.) Or would you like to continue as we have for the last month with everyone acting collectively and making decisions as a group with the lack of a lead?

2) There is now a governor position vacant on Phobos (or will be vacant in the upcoming election. Is there anyone willing to take on this role?


[07-Aug-22 06:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think having a leader is better than expecting a committee to be efficient


[07-Aug-22 06:39 PM] dersix#0000
1) I would prefer a formal leader, for many reasons where the two major ones are (i) face of OOG towards the ourside, central poc for ship orders and management (ii) "owner" of OOG resources to fund strategic growth (in order to prevent shortages)

Additionally keeping a collaborative and supportive style is required, in order to keep the commitment of everyone. In the last month everyone has jumped on whatever was necessary and this is the greates asset of OOG, but I was missing a but the longer perspective.

I am not experienced enough to govern Phobos, but perhaps I could fill in behind someone else on one of the simpler planets to free them up for Phobos

Recruitment is an important duty for the leader as well


[07-Aug-22 06:41 PM] dersix#0000
2) I'm very interested that phobos will run well, so I'll either can support someone thats willing, or drop griffonstone and step in for phobos

Also, this is a good opportunity for us to discuss the goal of the corp.  Are we looking to be an internal economy that is self-sustaining, are we oriented to a specific goal like building ships or controlling planets, or are we interested in maximizing efficiency to be financially sucessful?

I'm a market economy person, so I like interacting with the CX and market pricing to win in that sphere, but I think others have other priorities (which is great).  If we understand our goal, we can recruit the best players for that style versus just anyone who starts in ANT


[07-Aug-22 06:47 PM] churavis#0000
Well my personal goal is to hold as many records for the most gouged noses in as many materials as possible but that's not really something we can do as a corp


[08-Aug-22 12:58 AM] domicius#0000
My 2c. Someone should volunteer for leadership who wants to do all the hard work of planning, recruitment and directing the strategy. Its a lot of work, and very rewarding, but it's absolutely something for someone to take on as a commitment of time and effort.


[08-Aug-22 12:59 AM] domicius#0000
That leader can then direct strategy as to whether we carry on with spaceships or whatever.


[08-Aug-22 11:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
Who is the oldest member of the corp, in the sense who arrived first (not asking about the IRL age)?


[08-Aug-22 11:52 AM] insensless72#0000
DLR, Earthling, and myself founded OOG. I think DLR was a couple game days older than me


[08-Aug-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I‚Äôve always assumed insensless and DLR were both running things, so I certainly support you continuing in the leadership. Should definitely be someone with a lot of in-game and in-corp experience.


[08-Aug-22 02:39 PM] insensless72#0000
The system that DLR and I had worked really well. He was in charge of logistics, expansions, future goals etc while I was in charge of corporate operations. Creating and managing discord, making sure players were active, that the roles were available and correct for each player etc. I worry about myself taking over the lead position for several reasons, mainly because Im a teacher which means I dont have access to Discord for 9+ hrs a day, thus I dont feel like I would be able to provide the attention to detail that the role requires. I am perfectly happy continuing to do what I have been. Though I feel as though one of you guys might be a better fit as our fearless leader.


[08-Aug-22 02:56 PM] yang_mills#0000
Perhaps we than should ask who would like to assume the role of the leader, and then choose.


[08-Aug-22 03:01 PM] churavis#0000
We don't want to put too much on the next leader be have them burn out so I think we should try to create more roles and delicate as much as possible

[08-Aug-22 03:06 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Importantly, do we need someone other than DLR to run for Phobos governor?  That election ends in 4 days


[08-Aug-22 03:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Just don't want to forget that he raised that, although I suppose Churavis could run it in his stead for a month


[08-Aug-22 03:35 PM] exeler#0000
We could also go with a discord bot and a self service approach for a lot of the discord admin stuff like assigning planet roles and what not. 

I'm sure there's a half dozen already made bots to do that task, or someone in the corp can volunteer a few hours to make a custom one.

If we can find a leader then that would be great but i feel like no one could dedicate enough time to play PrUn almost like a full time job...... I'm for a collective decision making system


[08-Aug-22 08:24 PM] jackinabox86#0000
One idea I had for this moment in the corp is setting up a brief survey.  It could be an opportunity to see what members think our structure and priorities should be going forward.  Since this is such an asynchronous game, it might help get feedback from everyone over time, spark conversation, and give some guidance to the leadership about the membership‚Äôs desires.  Maybe it‚Äôs a crazy idea, but I thought I‚Äôd put it out there.  If I get 5 positive emojis, I can share a draft of a survey for everyone to comment on/add questions to, then we could put it on Google Forms in a couple days and see what we get back.


[08-Aug-22 08:24 PM] jackinabox86#0000
A couple sample questions are here to whet the appetite (most questions would be agree/disagree, with a small number of open ended questions).  Question: This corporation should prioritize building prestige corporation infrastructure projects.  Question: This corporation should come up with clever titles for its officers such as Viceroy for coordinator of governors, Commodore for coordinator of shipbuilding, and Chancellor of the Executor for coordinator of OOG Bank/logistics.  No need to discuss them; just thought I‚Äôd throw out a couple to show the range ofwhat I‚Äôm thinking of.

Here's a draft survey.  I'd convert it to Google Forms before actually suggesting people take the survey, but I thought it would be good to let anyone interested suggest adding or removing questions or otherwise adjust the format.  Ideally we wouldn't have to do something like this in the future, so want to make sure it's done right.  Happy to discuss any of the issues on the merits, but maybe that discussion would make most sense once we have a final draft.  I'll leave this open for a couple days to see if anyone cares to comment

[10-Aug-22 09:14 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Great work, thanks for taking the time to draft this! I think it looks great, the only addition I would like is maybe another question on new recruits. My philosophy on OOG recruiting is that we should add more people if necessary but I don't want to be one of those corps advertising on all chat looking for crazy amounts of people. The current size of us is small enough that you gain a sense of comradery with each other but large enough that we can firmly establish ourselves in Antares governorship and the ship building scene - its perfect! So I think recruiting should be done on the basis that the new player fits the current needs of OOG (for example we can always use more smelters on Deimos or RAT makers on Harmonia - both great industries for newer players to make an impact immediately) - not sure if there is a way to form this into a question or I'm just rambling lol üòÖ 

Also I'll take this moment to offer up my services to oversee recruiting if our new leader doesn't want to have to deal with it. I've worked with DLR to bring on quite a few OOG current members and I enjoy working with newer players so I'm happy to help!


[10-Aug-22 10:32 AM] jackinabox86#0000
could say instead of "prioritize players who share goals" to "prioritize players who can make a contribution to our goals and needs"

You'd be a great recruiting leader; I certainly appreciated being recruited by you!


[10-Aug-22 10:53 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yes, I like that wording! That covers my point quite well üôÇ

And thanks! Right back at you - it was fun trading with you even before you joined!

[11-Aug-22 09:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
This means that as long as a corporation has enough people on a planet, they can always control the planet, even if they do badly?


[11-Aug-22 09:23 PM] churavis#0000
If a corporation has more bases on a planet than anyone else they the corporation is the one that will suffer if they govern it badly


[11-Aug-22 09:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
You're right. If they want to develop well on an important planet, they should really manage it well.

Have we ever tried sending polite messages to inactive members asking them to leave the corp in game?


[11-Aug-22 11:50 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yes, I believe @insensless72 will poke people who are inactive and ask them to leave the corp. Otherwise the game will automatically kick them after 2 months of inactivity


[12-Aug-22 06:59 AM] insensless72#0000
I frequently check in on member activity, it often does not work. Sometimes it does though. I know of 3 currently that will liquidate soon and be kicked from corp. If anyone sees a player that is frequently doing business with you or has been playing for over a month with no corp, feel free to message them or refer them to me

Balbar looks promising. He produces carbon and STL fuel, from what I know. And he has an A rating.


[22-Aug-22 07:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
@churavis @insensless72 I asked this question on UFO: "Hello! I have a technical question. Can one run for governorship on a planet A if one is already governor on a different planet B and the term on B ends after the new term on A starts. Experience shows that one can still click the run button. But what happens if one is elected on A given that the terms on A and B overlap? Does one govern both planets for some time? Or does one autoresign from B as soon as one is elected on A? "


[22-Aug-22 07:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
And here is the answer from DiggingLake (SMG) : "As I understand it, nobody is elected if you are already a Governor and you win a governorship election: it just leaves the planet leaderless until the next election cycle.

Assuming there is nothing in place that retroactively makes you governor, then planet A will have no Governor for that term if you were to do that (since at the time you were elected, you were already a Governor and therefore couldn‚Äôt take office)."


[22-Aug-22 07:06 PM] churavis#0000
Well that's just asking for trouble


[22-Aug-22 07:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
So if @churavis is elected on Phobos, there won't be any governor. So I propose that I run on Phobos just for one term.


[22-Aug-22 07:07 PM] yang_mills#0000
But you @churavis, if you want to be governor on the term after that, you should not run on Harmonia. Perhaps @insensless72 could run on Harmonia instead. And @churavis will be without governorship for some time.


[22-Aug-22 07:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
Agree?


[22-Aug-22 07:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
I will also ask for 500 K AIC from corp if I am elected on Phobos, so as to support the costs.


[22-Aug-22 07:09 PM] erklein#0000
I'll also throw my hat in the ring and can run for governor somewhere. I haven't really tried to yet but I'm interested in at least trying it out for a term


[22-Aug-22 07:10 PM] yang_mills#0000
Then you could try either on Phobos or Harmonia.


[22-Aug-22 07:11 PM] churavis#0000

He will be able to run on Phobos the term after that. I ask for official endorsement from Ooga Booga. I will also ask for 500 K AIC from the corp once (and if) I am elected. This is to support the upkeep costs. I will also start soon pinging some of you to purchase upkeep materials that you produce.

[03-Sep-22 07:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
Dear citizens of Phobos,

I am Yang_Mills, the CEO of Baryonic Technologies (BARY) and member of the Ooga Booga Capital Management corporation (OOG). On behalf of my corporation, I run for the governorship on Phobos. The current governor, DLR, cannot run this time because of real life duties.

I started in PrUn 263 days ago as a modest carbon farmer on Phobos. Now I run an industrial empire stretching over 8 planets. But I kept an emotional attachment to Phobos. I also have a lot of experience in upkeeping the POPI on Phobos, since DLR has already delegated to me part of this task in the past. Thanks to the support of OOG, I will be able to keep the need fulfilment of pops at a high level.

I intend to keep the tax levels on Phobos as they are know. I will also ensure the growth of engineers and scientists on Phobos. For our corporation, the OOG, Phobos is of critical importance, and in particular the high level pops here are of critical importance. Indeed, we have a significant electronics production here.

So vote for me for a prosperous and high tech Phobos¬†!

i feel like politics is the right place to get affirmation on my observation.

so i hopped into FIOC server.  is it fair to say that OBCM feels more capitalist, and they are more socialist?
from what i gather, OBCM lets people run their own stuff and sell it (even if there is coordination for the goods, it's still all paid for, not given)
FIOC said members give inputs to other people and maintain the lines that way, with the ability to make money a thing you do, more or less, on your own?

That is not socialist, it's a gift economy and it's quite different from socialism which isn't really possible in this game


[03-Sep-22 06:50 PM] insensless72#0000
OBCM helps you obtain whatever goal it is you have in game and requests you sell it at a reasonable rate internally and whatever price you feel externally. Though preferably you sell internally since we all benefit from others benefitting... if that makes sense


[03-Sep-22 06:53 PM] seraphx2#0000
yeah, that makes total sense and how i've always liked to play games or handle "trade" in them.


[03-Sep-22 08:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt be happy in the FIOC world. The fun thing about this for me is the market, so eliminating any pricing signals or profit would take away the very element of the game. I can build whatever in other games, but here the goal is more than just growing for the sake of it


[03-Sep-22 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
What is FIOC? Another game or another Corp?


[03-Sep-22 08:49 PM] seraphx2#0000
Corp


[03-Sep-22 08:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
So this Corp requires its members to implement the planned economy internally?


[03-Sep-22 08:51 PM] seraphx2#0000
well, the system is called "gift" so the idea that you give things without expectations of anything in return.
but, it sounds like they still coordinate, and without regularly planned "gifts", i'm not sure how you guarantee a system is gonna function.


[03-Sep-22 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Space communism basically


[03-Sep-22 08:54 PM] seraphx2#0000
without money, you'd have to at least guarantee free food for all members


[03-Sep-22 08:54 PM] seraphx2#0000
because none of them will have money to go buy food on their own


[03-Sep-22 08:55 PM] seraphx2#0000
you can sell off to the side, but any new member is gonna be without that for a long time


[03-Sep-22 08:56 PM] seraphx2#0000
i dunno. just seems weird to me. and while they call it "gift" i think that's a lot different than the idea of what real gift economy is where it isn't really the whole economy being run that way, it seems more like a philosophy to implement when you can. (in real life)

FIOC sounds more like a barter system to me if anything


[03-Sep-22 08:56 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think we can implement a certain degree of state-owned economy in shipbuilding and planet management, but other fields have to give members room to make profits through the free market.


[03-Sep-22 08:56 PM] seraphx2#0000
‚¨ÜÔ∏è


[03-Sep-22 08:57 PM] churavis#0000
State-owned and communally coordinated are not the same thing


[03-Sep-22 08:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think we‚Äôll always do best by letting market forces work to the greatest extent possible internally. Helps rationalize supply and demand. Shipbuilding has such small volume that it may be a special case, but our participants in that generally don‚Äôt lose money. FIOC can make it work for them because they have enough extremely long term members who can support new entrants. We have that to an extent, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to play in their system


[03-Sep-22 09:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
If the game allows, you can actually put the shipbuilding, transportation and banking on a shared account managed by ceo and other managers.


[03-Sep-22 09:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
In this way, it is convenient to settle the cost, while ensuring that the stability of Corp's core functions is not affected by someone's resignation.


[03-Sep-22 09:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, this Corp central bank, shipyard and public transportation function should be provided by the game developer.üòÖ


[03-Sep-22 09:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
But it seems that they can't afford to develop so many functions.


[03-Sep-22 09:05 PM] yuen8241#0000

how do taxes work again? I know it's for 24h of production, but is it independent of workers amounts?


[12-Sep-22 11:34 AM] churavis#0000
It is independent of production amount and based solely on the amount of production time take, another reason why efficiency is so important


[12-Sep-22 11:36 AM] allocater#0000
so 100 PIO farm working for 24h pays the same tax as 40 PIO INC working for 24h? (normalized)


[12-Sep-22 11:59 AM] churavis#0000
Now that I research it actually, I think it's based on the standard amount of time a product takes, rounded to the nearest half dollar.


[12-Sep-22 12:06 PM] allocater#0000
yes speeding up does not change the tax

Any idea why our dividend has fallen off a cliff?  I know most of our long-term members don't really notice it, but it's a nice benefit for the newer players and it's strange to me that it's dropped so far, so fast.  We haven't added many new members and we haven't lost a planet that I know of.  Are the private contracts killing LM fees that much?


[27-Sep-22 09:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, it is. I don't see ad on many planets.


[27-Sep-22 09:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Especially those planets that need a high degree of cooperation rather than simply selling and purchasing raw materials. Maybe only some transport contracts exist.


[27-Sep-22 09:42 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's a concerning drop. I assumed it was a delayed effect connected to LM fees. We should compare our drop to the drop in public accounting for other planets and see if it's similar.


[27-Sep-22 09:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
From this perspective, it seems that we should give some planets to advanced players outside oog. On the one hand, it can improve our profitability, on the other hand, it can save energy. I found that the unemployment rate of major planets outside Antares is higher than here.Maybe it's because Antares has added a lot of new players, or maybe it's because we haven't invested enough in infrastructure.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Sep-22 10:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
My information is incomplete, but I have briefly observed the other three areas. It seems that only Antares has the situation that a Corp like ours controls many planets. The number of our energetic old players obviously can't compare with the number of planets we control/prepare to control. DLR and Yang both left. I observe that since DLR left, the population growth of Phobos is not as good as that of Moria and QQ, which also have advanced population.


[27-Sep-22 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
I've been working to lower unemployment esp among the lower tiers on QJ-650c, since a high population needs more support. At the same time there was a slight demand for engineers there, but we handled that pretty well through. Phobos is tough with the crazy engineer demand.. cause unemployment on settlers is quite high. That's because anyone can add software labs and turn engineers directly into money by making EDCs. Decent chance that's what's going on there.


[27-Sep-22 10:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
The current policy of qj-650c is resources, and I prefer it to be chemistry.


[27-Sep-22 10:14 AM] churavis#0000
Perhaps we should raise taxes on engineers and scientists on Phobos?


[27-Sep-22 10:14 AM] rune_242#0000

Deimos has certainly not seen the fall off we have.


[27-Sep-22 01:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ideally we'd keep track of our share count and governed planets per week ü§∑  I'm slightly inspired to track that


[27-Sep-22 08:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
In a short time, we lost two old players in a row. Maybe we should give some unmaintainable planets to others. Then focus on making up for the loss of our shipbuilding industry


[27-Sep-22 08:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yeah, we probably have to pull back some. As long as someone wants to govern a planet, we can support them, but other than Churaviis making the play for Phobos, I don‚Äôt think we can add anything for a while


[27-Sep-22 08:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
My data shows us with "Nike, Demeter, Phobos, Harmonia, Griffonstone, Norwick, Nascent, and QJ-650c". We didn't lose any recently, right?


[27-Sep-22 08:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
our profits seem to have dropped much more drastically than the governors for Heph, Deimos, and Etherwind. So yeah maybe turn them over to people who want to govern them with individual governance corps. ü§∑


[27-Sep-22 08:13 PM] jackinabox86#0000
And consider raising taxes a bit to cover expenses. I think the dividend should be the last of our concerns, but we need the governors to be able to do what they need


[27-Sep-22 08:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
From the perspective of our core industries, we must first keep nike and deimos.demeter and nacent only occupies the quota, it's not difficult to maintain it. We can keep them.


[27-Sep-22 08:15 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Why do we have to keep anything in particular? We have the numbers to control the COGC. The engineers on Phobos are as important as anything else


[27-Sep-22 08:15 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It‚Äôs about keeping the population where we need it


[27-Sep-22 08:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
As long as we can maintain Phobos, I think it is worth it. But I saw that DLR and Yang both managed Phobos and left. I think this planet must take a lot of energy.


[27-Sep-22 08:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Sure, I just don‚Äôt think any particular planet is more important to us than another.


[27-Sep-22 08:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm just worried that if we can't maintain these important planets, our own industry will be damaged. If so, I would rather agree to give these planets to someone who can manage them well. Because there are really few Corp in the game that control many important planets like us.


[30-Sep-22 04:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Probably need to let Griffonstone go.  Personally, I'd rather do shipbuilding than govern everything, but that can be up to the corp to decide

The extra dividends/payments don't come anywhere close to the amount you will spend on programs and upkeep items. Plus if you want improvements people generally assume you will cover it, I just paid a Nike resident 400K to upgrade the ART. So what I'm sayin is make sure you have other means of income first üôÇ


[21-Oct-22 10:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
It's okay. If all goes well, my income will be able to support these costs in the next term. But not now. I have a lot of debts and expansion plans.


[21-Oct-22 10:30 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Well then we need to win the election this time, otherwise the new guy is going to be governor in the future.


[21-Oct-22 10:31 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm not particularly engaged in the governor game because it seems to burn out anyone who touches it, so I don't mind if we just focus on shipbuilding, but if I can help provide upkeep somewhere, let me know what the shortfall is


[21-Oct-22 10:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
I doubt whether he has enough resources and energy to last a term.


[21-Oct-22 10:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
Anyway, given that YJ14 has already borne a lot of costs, I will participate in providing maintenance costs this term. Everyone will take up much less energy and resources after sharing.


[21-Oct-22 10:45 AM] churavis#0000
I think what we need is to be sure to be on the ballot and campaigning before the election starts as it's easier to get people to choose us when they first get the election notice than it is to get them to change their minds later. Momentum is powerful.

[21-Oct-22 10:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, yj14 is too busy these days, which leads to this newcomer grabbing the right to speak.


[21-Oct-22 10:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
We have 13 members who have bases in nike.


[21-Oct-22 10:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
Conversely, 12 members have no base in nike.


[21-Oct-22 12:36 PM] yjhasaday#0000
We've never really needed to campaign on Nike, there's never really been any competition lol. I didn't think there would be either, Nike is only like 20% base capacity


[22-Oct-22 07:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
If they want to choose a new person so badly, Then we can see what will happen when he is elected. In any case, managing such a planet is a loss.


[22-Oct-22 07:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
If he is elected, I personally won't offer any help. Since they naively believe that taxation can support infrastructure construction and maintenance, let them, the opposition, manage it.


[22-Oct-22 08:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
All problems can be solved with spreadsheets


[22-Oct-22 08:24 PM] archielvahr#0000

[22-Oct-22 08:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
So next up is Churaviis for Phobos on Oct 26th. This sheet can be a reminder for governors to click run and make a short statement ahead of voting starting.


[22-Oct-22 08:27 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Love it


[22-Oct-22 08:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
Another is that someone needs to remind the planet project regularly during vacation. The biggest opinion of the opponents this time is that the project is not working.


[22-Oct-22 08:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah, that's run once per week, right? Like every time the dividend comes in perhaps


[22-Oct-22 08:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
the program runs at the POPR, but if you're looking for a reminder, the dividend isn't a bad idea


[22-Oct-22 08:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
would be nice if FIO could just check if one is running on a planet, so you could only bother governors who haven't done it yet


[22-Oct-22 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yj14 went on vacation during this term, so next time if a governor encounters a similar situation, we have to have a solution.


[22-Oct-22 08:50 PM] domicius#0000
We should have owned up to it in the election. Its a very understandable reason

Unfortunately, there is no escrow function, otherwise the authority can be directly given to those who are not on vacation.


[22-Oct-22 09:02 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, anyone can contribute mats to the projects right? Just the governor needs to select a program occasionally?


[22-Oct-22 09:03 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, I actually did upgrade the SST and INF while he was gone


[22-Oct-22 09:03 PM] churavis#0000
Programs and taxes are the only things that only the governor can do


[23-Oct-22 04:39 AM] allocater#0000
part of me wants to stop managing heph popi to see if the gov notices and fixes it üòõ


[23-Oct-22 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
The governor of heph is so opposed to our management of nike, you really don't need to help him provide those infrastructure maintenance products. After all, heph's taxes belong to him alone. He seems to think that we can earn a lot of benefits by raising taxes. I'm afraid it's because he doesn't contribute much to heph maintenance.


[23-Oct-22 08:47 AM] churavis#0000
Yeah, we shouldn't enable governors to embezzle taxes


[23-Oct-22 09:33 AM] allocater#0000
has the debate been settled, whether govs are responsible for popi donations or if this is a collective effort?


[23-Oct-22 09:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that they have adopted double standards for us. When we are governors, it is the governor's responsibility. When we are not governors, it is a collective responsibility.üòÖ


[23-Oct-22 09:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
Personally, I think we should  focus on shipbuilding and industrial development. Being a governor costs money and energy. We manage more planets, and it is easy to be attacked by groups.


[23-Oct-22 09:49 AM] churavis#0000
We shouldn't be donating but we should be offering to sell upkeep items to the governor

{Reactions}
üëç 

[23-Oct-22 09:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
We have many industries in nike, so it is necessary to maintain the operation of nike's infrastructure from the perspective of economic rationality. But after we have maintained and expanded nike infrastructure, they are still so opposed to our administration. I don't think it's a good idea to continue donating.


[23-Oct-22 09:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
No matter which Corp wants to be governor, it needs to rely on taxes and its own funds to maintain infrastructure.


[23-Oct-22 09:55 AM] churavis#0000
If we lose Nike, as seems likely, then we can offer upkeep items at a discount


[23-Oct-22 09:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
There are 19 votes against us. I believe these people should be fully prepared to maintain Nike's infrastructure during the next term.


[23-Oct-22 09:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
Discount is fine, but we can't give it for nothing. When you give too easily, they won't cherish it.


[23-Oct-22 09:58 AM] churavis#0000
Also, if they have to pay for everything themselves then they might not want to run next term


[23-Oct-22 10:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, they think things too simply, or they think us too easily.  We invest so much money in nike mostly for honor. After all, our people basically have enough labor force. We can't take the initiative to help them do things well for free after they take away the honor.


[23-Oct-22 10:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, considering our own problems, we manage many planets and have left several old players, so it is easy to have problems. My working capital is rich now. If you are short of materials or money, I can contribute.


[23-Oct-22 10:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
Phobos has provided me with a lot of profits. If you need, I can share some of the costs.


[23-Oct-22 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
It does seem like there's a rising expectation that governors are supposed to cover all donations. They usually locally source them, so they can buy them from us. I also like that idea.


[23-Oct-22 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also think there's a trend towards more and more people making EDCs. That's tough because they take a lot more population upkeep, so there's a high incentive for them to free-load


[23-Oct-22 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
My account is 180 days old today, so it lines up with this EDC volume chart

[23-Oct-22 07:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
Being a governor and providing refueling service is very energy-consuming, and everyone has their own life. It's not your fault.


[23-Oct-22 07:36 PM] yuen8241#0000
So Phobos's engineer tax should be the highest. Or if we are directly involved as bookmakers, hitchhiking can be ignored.


[23-Oct-22 07:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
SeaPear wanted to raise taxes (particularly on the Benten electronics engineers) and that was part of the rebellion. Although I think he approached the issue in the wrong way... perhaps better to let other people deal with it.


[23-Oct-22 09:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
What was our last dividend? I remember that the dividend amount was less than 10,000 AIC.


[23-Oct-22 09:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
I can't see it in the financial statements.


[23-Oct-22 09:23 PM] yuen8241#0000
Consider that there are 26 of us, that is, the tax revenue of all the planets in a month is less than 1.04 million.


[23-Oct-22 09:25 PM] balbar#0000
Corporation dividend received    2 hours ago    9,180.00 AIC D. wait, you meant the one before that? Uh..yeah, I also only remember <10K


[23-Oct-22 09:25 PM] balbar#0000
so yeah, less than 10K


[23-Oct-22 09:26 PM] churavis#0000
We've been losing planet governorships and adding members


[23-Oct-22 09:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter, these taxes will never be enough to recover the cost. One planet of nike alone is enough to spend 250,000 maintenance fees, not to mention the more expensive Phobos.


[23-Oct-22 09:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Demeter and QJ-650c are tiny, and I have min taxes on my planet. So I'm guessing they account for almost nothing. Nike and Harmonia are bigger, but have pretty low taxes. Phobos actually has decently high taxes. I'm guessing Phobos accounts for the vast majority of our income


[23-Oct-22 09:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
I just saw on Nike channel that some people are not sure whether all taxes will go to the mayor or be evenly distributed within the company. I remember that taxes are distributed equally.


[23-Oct-22 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
yep


[23-Oct-22 09:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
The newcomer running for governor, he is not the only one in his Corp, but all of them are newcomers. If he is elected, he will lose a lot.üòÜ

I have one on the way


[24-Oct-22 12:40 AM] yuen8241#0000

Do I understand it correctly? I didn't see this meaning the first time.


[24-Oct-22 03:54 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
The way I understood is that he received a message accusing YJ14 of keeping the taxes - and he (Nirces) is saying that it's wrong perception because OOG are pretty much the only people contributing and it's easy to check that by looking at the contribution records. He's saying to the people voting for the new guy to check the records as well so they can change their vote. 
At least that's how I get it?


[24-Oct-22 03:58 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
Also tbh that RiseOfFilth guy is kinda annoying. Like the current governor had some IRL stuff to handle, shit happens - don't hang the guy for one mistake. IMO you guys should not contribute anything if you lose the planet - and let them suffer for a bit to learn a lesson.


[24-Oct-22 04:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, especially considering that allocater also helped him donate materials in Heph, and we didn't compete with him in heph.


[24-Oct-22 04:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
There is a proverb in my country, if you give a poor man a little food every day, he will thank you very much, but if you give him a lot of food, he will hate you.

He's definitely taking it all a bit to far. I don't contribute to Nike, but I would definitely cool it and see if he can get the budget to "balance"

Dear fellow industrialists of Nike: it has come to our attention that Swatacular has basically been PMing everyone and lying about OOG.

It's just a game, but some liars are always gonna liar, y'know.

There's enough lying in the world these days, without having it in our games.  If the liar wins, he won't get a single helping hand from OOG.  Let's see *him* run an honest and open government.

[24-Oct-22 11:08 AM] jackinabox86#0000
That's pretty strong.  We have decent relationships across the sector.  I'd just say that we think it's underhanded to distort the record in that way.  We've built the infrastructure and contributed the upkeep.  There has been a bit of a slump the last two weeks, but we want the chance to get things back in shape


[24-Oct-22 11:08 AM] jackinabox86#0000
if people want to consider someone new, that's fine, but they should do so knowing the real record


[24-Oct-22 11:08 AM] churavis#0000
A quick glance through the POPI pages will show all the people who contributed


[24-Oct-22 11:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
also, I probably wouldn't threaten to blackball Nike contributions


[24-Oct-22 11:09 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I ABSOLUTELY think we should do so, but it's not the best threat to get us voted in now


[24-Oct-22 11:10 AM] churavis#0000
We should focus on how he's trying to lie about OOG and YJ14 while not giving him the chance to respond


[24-Oct-22 11:11 AM] domicius#0000
We have to put the blackball out there. He has said that he would value our contributions if he wins. We have to show that's not on the table

I'm a huge fan of YJ, he recruited me, and he does a ton for the corp.  But he left an opening here.  We have to project, with his help, that we'll close that opening and maintain programs, etc. going forward.  A threat doesn't assuage people's concerns that we might drop the ball in the future


[24-Oct-22 11:14 AM] jackinabox86#0000
and frankly, if we lose, and this turkey Swat fails, we can point to that in the future

[24-Oct-22 11:14 AM] domicius#0000
I don't think anyone really cares we missed 2 weeks. Most people probably didn't even notice or if they did, they would have posted in chat. They voted because he lied about us.


[24-Oct-22 11:15 AM] domicius#0000
He has like 4 planets but is a star contributor, so I guess a whale?


[24-Oct-22 11:15 AM] jackinabox86#0000

OK, I'll skip the blackball. We can do that later. How's this:

Dear fellow industrialists of Nike: it has come to our attention that Swatacular has basically been PMing everyone and lying about OOG "not contributing to the infrastructure" .

If you want to see the truth, , have a look at the contributions to the buildings in the POPI. It's all from OOG. The only thing that Swatacular has contributed to date is *nothing*. 

It's just a game, but liars are always gonna lie, y'know.

There's enough lying in the world these days, without having it in our games.  Nike - I urge you to make a stand against it.


[24-Oct-22 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
It would be more fun to let him take the planet and call out everything he does.


[24-Oct-22 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000

[24-Oct-22 11:19 AM] dehzhas#0000

[24-Oct-22 11:21 AM] dehzhas#0000
Strong attacks tend to escalate and that isn't good for anyone in this case. I think we have a strong case to win here and only really need 1-2 votes to switch. My base should be up before the voting ends as well.


[24-Oct-22 11:21 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Sure, but when you have open jobs on a planet, they do need to be running

Not only has Swatacluar contributed nothing but he has far too few bases to be able to contribute all the upkeep as many upkeep items aren't regularly available on the CX for a good price

That's the angle I think we should take. We have a corp backing YJ, we have evidence of contribution by multiple members of the corp


[24-Oct-22 11:31 AM] dehzhas#0000
And YJ can apologize for any hiccup that occurred. Everyone is human and this is a game ... so...

That plus call Swatacular out for dishonest tactics and being misleading about the current Gov and I think we will have the victory

I don't make a habit of checking in-game chat channels, so we might get fresh eyes when we post this in UFO's Nike-politics channel


[24-Oct-22 11:41 AM] domicius#0000
OK
PaxMagellanic has crafted some softer messages for us.


[24-Oct-22 11:42 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
Wrote some stuff with Domicius -** for UFO discord: **

"Dear fellow industrialists of Nike: It has come to our attention that Swatacular, running for governor of Nike, has been PM'ing people and telling lies about the contributions of the current governor by stating that "the previous gov hasn't been contributing to the planetary infrastructure". This is appears to be deliberately misleading and a twisting of the truth. 
To make something clear - OOG as a corporation has contributed the vast majority of materials and upkeep as a corporation to Nike since we've taken governmentship of the planet. The simple fact is that Swatacular is putting a friendly face in a public forum and trying to manipulate the situation behind the scenes by lying or even worse, not understanding the impacts of what he's saying. 
We are more than happy to support candidates outside of OOG if they show promise, knowledge and integrity - but we won't be supporting people like Swatacular that believe they can gain governmentship through underhanded tactics. We want ANT to grow as a strong region with veteran players leading it through their logistics, their corp mates and their bank accounts. 

There's also the need to set the record straight regarding the current governor of Nike. Yes, there was a mistake in the last period, but look back at months of OOG running the planet and see the massive investment we have put in terms of materials and money to grow the planet and ensure that you all have the needed population to continue your growth. Let's make sure one mistake won't be used as an excuse to wipe all that progress, and let's not put the noose around someone's neck over a single mistake.

To summarize, we will not support Swatacular as governor of Nike due to him twisting the truth to gain votes, lack of knowledge and especially now integrity".
-------
*For ingame chat: *
**First mesage: **
"Swatacular has been lying by saying that "the previous gov hasn't been contributing to the planetary infrastructure" in private messages to people. To make something clear - OOG as a corporation has contributed the vast majority of materials and upkeep as a corporation to Nike since we've taken governmentship of the planet. We are more than happy to support candidates outside of OOG if they show promise, knowledge and integrity but at this moment Swatacular is not showing any of that. We want ANT to grow as a strong region with veteran players leading it through their logistics, their corp mates and their bank accounts, not lies and underhanded tactics."

**Second message:**
"There's also the need to set the record straight regarding the current governor of Nike. Yes, there was a mistake in the last period, but look back at months of OOG running the planet and see the massive investment we have put in terms of materials and money to grow the planet and ensure that you all have the needed population to continue your growth. Let's make sure one mistake won't be used as an excuse to wipe all that progress, and let's not put the noose around someone's neck over a single mistake. We simply can't support someone thats running on the platform of backhanded lies and inexperience."

[24-Oct-22 11:48 AM] dehzhas#0000
I would change the "This is misleading on purpose and twisting the truth" part. I would avoid claiming knowledge of someones motives.

Maybe "This appears misleading on purpose"...

So I finally had some time to sit down and read everything and catch myself up. I'm not a fan of the smear-style politics so I took a softer approach, but thank you for coming to my defense guys! This guy clearly doesn't understand how badly Nike operates at a loss lol üòÖ . I made it clear in a message in the in-game Nike channel that I am not profiting from this. I guess I should probably message UFO as well? Thoughts?


[24-Oct-22 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, just a short message to let people know you are around probably.


[24-Oct-22 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
reiterate whatever points seem appropriate for you


[24-Oct-22 03:46 PM] churavis#0000
I know you don't like smear tactics but this guy is seriously not prepared to govern a large planet. He only has a handful of bases and he's the second biggest member of his corp. Most of his corp only have 2 bases, half of which are not even in Antares and none of which are on Nike. Each of them will get 11% of the taxes but I doubt they'll all be contributing.


[24-Oct-22 03:53 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Also what further efforts can we do to expand Nike infrastructure - I feel like they orchestrated a mass building of higher tier buildings to sway popular opinion. But nevertheless the higher tier buildings are now on planet and need to be accommodated - can someone who is a little more knowledgeable on POPI manipulation please let me know the best/fastest way to upgrade infrastructure for TECH/ENGs?

I'll say something: people do bad things sometimes, and you have to tell them they've done a bad thing. And if there's anything decent inside them, they will accept it. For Swat, we were just an anonymous group of people and he went behind us and talked I'll of us to our fellow players. And I've made it clear to him that this was not OK - people we've played for years with. We can be politic and polite, but if we don't call out people who behave badly to us.... Well, they'll think its fine to keep doing so.

I'm glad you've spoken YJ14 - your voice is perhaps the most important one in this election.


[24-Oct-22 04:22 PM] domicius#0000
We finally have Swat on chat saying he doesn't want to win...


[24-Oct-22 04:23 PM] domicius#0000
I'm gonna leave that there so the voters can see it.


[24-Oct-22 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
It looks like safety is a challenge- even over the past 5ish population reports, it hasn't really gone above 70%, and the population has grown since then. Safety will cap the other needs, including comfort and health.  Higher settler happiness will push more of them up the education chain. That's probably at least as important as the education programs. If we can't keep the happiness up, the festivity might be better than education even... or at least close.


[24-Oct-22 04:24 PM] churavis#0000
Should we upgrade the SST again?


[24-Oct-22 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I tried a population calculating worksheet but I didn't find one that seemed to be working as expected.


[24-Oct-22 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000

[24-Oct-22 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000

Swatacular obviously adopted a pre-emptive strategy, and he attacked us in a discredited way to incite opposition.

If I run for office next time, I have to find out how the planet works and what the governor needs to do. Obviously, nike has a few people who like to find fault with us.


[24-Oct-22 11:06 PM] churavis#0000
From now on when we get opposition running against us in an election the first thing we need to do is send them a private message and ask if they know what being governor would entail and whether they actually want to take on that huge responsibility or not.

was pretty damn annoyed with him, yet again


[25-Oct-22 01:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
FWIW, RiseOfFilth and crew are good people, very helpful to those new to the game. I'm in their discord and chat with them regularly, but they do tend to get out in front of their skis a bit. He supplied me a lot of bfabs early on but couldn't keep up with my demand and instead of letting me know before hand, I had a befab order that just sat there unfulfilled for a while because he was logistically overloaded. He also tends to have a more dictatorial leadership style, which is fine if you want that sort of thing.


[25-Oct-22 01:46 PM] dehzhas#0000
I mean, I have been a few hours late on my consumables orders a few times but a governor needs to be pretty on top of a lot of things.


[25-Oct-22 01:47 PM] dehzhas#0000
And have lots of resources to run at a deficit... not something I would generally thing that crew was prepared to do well


[26-Oct-22 02:56 AM] dehzhas#0000
For next Nike term:

If I read the the Nike in-game chat correctly, it looks like @yjhasaday is going to swap out of Nike governor next term in favor of another OOG member? If so, I would like to try my hand at it.

Here is the basic outline of my pitch:

Goal #1: Zero open jobs - I'm working on a spreadsheet that lays out the rough plan for what we need to maintain at what levels to move to the right population levels. I will hone it over the next 3 weeks of YJ14's term.

Goal #2: Easy access to consumables - I plan to have enough capacity by then to provide most, if not all, needed consumables for the planet at current population levels. They will be available on-demand in the LM at or below market rates, no need for shipping or logistics planning. Purchasing consumables from me on the LM at reasonable rates is much appreciated as this will be a significant source of income to put back into the development of Nike while keeping taxes low.

Goal #3: Readily available SEA - Source your other fabs just like any other planet, but SEA will be available on planet at or below market rates, easing the logistics of establishing and growing a base on Nike.

Goal #4: Fast and regular shipping capacity to/from ANT and Deimos - I will provide several kt/day myself, but will also take actions to foster the development of fast, regular and efficient shipping lanes to get goods to/from Nike to the most common locations in volume.

The ultimate goal here is to make the logistics of managing a base on Nike as easy as possible, while providing the funding needed to sustain and grow the planet as a whole.


[26-Oct-22 02:57 AM] dehzhas#0000
Thoughts?

I can probably handle the first 2 items, #3 I will need help from someone who can produce and provide SEA at a reasonable price on Nike LM, for #4 I'll need 2 FTL ships from the corp to get that going.


[26-Oct-22 04:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
That's great. I would like to make two suggestions. First, the consumption of SEA is not large, on the contrary, fabs is very large. Secondly, from the perspective of risk diversification, I hope not to concentrate too many boats on one person.


[26-Oct-22 04:22 AM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, I prefer that the company can provide an LBC ship as a long-term flight to transport demeter's crops. My crops are going to be moldy there.üòÖ


[26-Oct-22 04:25 AM] dehzhas#0000
What kind of crops? I‚Äôm looking for GRN, NUT and BEA in large quantities. If you make those I will buy them and would love for you to have a ship to deliver them to me üòÜ


[26-Oct-22 04:25 AM] yuen8241#0000

Mmmk, next OOG boat should probably be a Demeter boat, whoever flies it


[26-Oct-22 04:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, the transportation pressure between ANT, Deimos and Nike is not great, but the biggest ones are demeter and etherwind.


[26-Oct-22 04:27 AM] rune_242#0000
I've send dozens of contracts to domicius to help me with shipping MAI to nascent


[26-Oct-22 04:27 AM] dehzhas#0000
I think the Nike proposal is strong without the shipping component, we can just leave that off


[26-Oct-22 04:28 AM] rune_242#0000
I am still working on paying back my 2k/2k ship and when that is done I'll get another one


[26-Oct-22 04:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have nearly 20,000 H2O and DW that haven't been shipped back from etherwind. My crops in demeter were too large for the warehouse before.

Here's my reaction.  Glad to see your interest; I know Yuen expressed an interest previously, but I don't care who does it as long as they're attentive and can use the pop calculator to get pop levels where they need to be.  Honestly goal 1 and 2 are sufficient to get you an easy W.  I've never heard of a governor who tries to sell something like SEA.  I don't have an issue with it, but all we have is in-corp production atm.  If you want to sponsor someone else or something, that's great, but unnecessary.


[26-Oct-22 06:44 AM] jackinabox86#0000
On corp ships, they're really just ships that players have bought with their funds (or won) that they make available for other corp members.  We don't have a common set of funds that we invest in things like specific ship routes.  I'd love it if we did that, but we haven't historically.  Perhaps a model that could work is having pools of members of a planet pool together to invest in a ship (like a Demeter to Nascent route or something).  Buy shares and have a committed schedule and tonnage to benefit from.

[26-Oct-22 06:45 AM] jackinabox86#0000
But personally, I'd only invest when its for the benefit of corp members, not planet communities.  Ships are expensive and we have a ton of internal demand.  Currently, if we could get the UPF or whatever makes bridges and crew quarters going, we'd be at an FTL ship every five days that is available for purhcase

Actually, if someone manages Nike, I will be very happy, and I can focus on my development in consumables and shipbuilding industry. Of course, I have enough resources and energy to manage Nike if necessary.


[26-Oct-22 07:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of extra planets out there that need governors üòâ Demeter is ungoverned and would be an easy one to get started with


[26-Oct-22 09:30 AM] churavis#0000
Yes, you should definitely start with governing a smaller planet with low tier population first before you start on one with a higher tier population.


[26-Oct-22 09:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
My other reaction to @dehzhas 's proposal: I think acquiring normal POPI materials is plenty for a governor to take on. I don't think I've ever seen a governor go further than that (making SEA and shipping available). So I wouldn't want you to burn out... or get the general non-OOG populace of Nike too complacent- give them a fish and they will ask for fish and lobster

I will campaign on "No open jobs" + "Fair priced consumables"

{Reactions}
üëç 

[26-Oct-22 10:27 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I like it! Especially the first point. I think the reason I lost the people was because I don't put any effort in to calculate the best way to fix population problems (too be fair Nike doesn't usually have this problem and any time we got low on open jobs I would just through money at it). So if you do come up with a plan that is mathematically backed-up that would be great!

As others have said, I wouldn't worry about point 3 or 4 - SEA isn't actually in high demand because the amounts needed are so low. Also I can start storing more of it on planet to fill any needs (my Avalon base extracts some SCR and I've finally started making a good amount of S on Deimos so my production of SEA has increased recently). Shipping shouldn't be an issue because Nike is the main planet for our corp, there are always ships coming and going - if anyone needs something moved they can just message the shipping channel and someone should pick it up pretty quick.

Point 2 is a good idea but one that concerns me for you're own good - I just want to make sure you're careful you don't burn yourself out! You're already doing a ton with the weekly consumable deliveries for us (thank you!), being governor would add to your workload (especially right now while we try to fix Nike), and I'm sure you have expansion plans too. Just make sure you don't bite off more than you can chew üòÖ


[26-Oct-22 10:30 AM] dehzhas#0000
That is why I'm doing this now, hehe.... so I have 3 weeks to prepare before the election starts. I want to going knowing I have everything covered. I have plans for about 2-3 full bases between now and then.

[27-Oct-22 02:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
As the headquarters of Nike OOG and my personal original planet, I hope to run for the next governor of Nike. My campaign platform is as follows: 1. Provide funds and resources for the maintenance of the planet's infrastructure. 2. Continue to upgrade Wildlife Park. 3. Cancel Nike's advertising expenses and increase the taxes of technicians and engineers. My advantages are: 1. I have a high and stable income. 2. Have a mature fabs, chemical and food production lineÔºåwhich will be  helpful to provide products to maintain infrastructure.. I'm about to set up two UPFs, which will be very helpful to upgrade Wildlife Park to solve the shortage of technicians . 3. I have stable game time and enough energy, and my Pro license has 8 months left.


[27-Oct-22 02:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
During yj14' s term of office, I will assist him to maintain the infrastructure of the planet and solve the shortage of technicians and engineers as soon as possible. It's also part of learning to manage the planet.

I won't provide services other than infrastructure maintenance to people outside Corp, but I'm happy to sponsor new players of Corp to build a base in Nike. After our old friend left, our fabs production decreased a lot, and new blood was needed to supplement it.

Two days ago you said about @dehzhas  running on Nike: "Actually, if someone manages Nike, I will be very happy, and I can focus on my development in consumables and shipbuilding industry. Of course, I have enough resources and energy to manage Nike if necessary." @yuen8241


[27-Oct-22 04:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000

[27-Oct-22 04:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm happy to let @yuen8241 take it. I just need to know one way or the other soon-ish as it will change expansion choices I make.


[27-Oct-22 07:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the past two days, I have studied the maintenance cost and time cost of the planet, and I found that I can do it. It's not as complicated as I thought before. Personally, I think I can do better than Dehzhas at this stage. He should expand the profitable industry first.


[27-Oct-22 07:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
Thank you for your humility. The cost of managing Nike will be very high. In terms of benefits, you should now invest in profitable industries and improve the industrial chain.

FYI, TheNoNinja is sad "Those damn ooga booga guys" (joking as far as I can tell, not really mad or anything) are winning on Norwick.  They are encouraging him to campaign over in the "Aluminum Alliance" channels (RiseOfFilth, Rannepear, Bobemor).

My general sense is that increasingly many of the OOG Ant elections are going to be contested over the next several cycles. We are probably going to have to stay on top of all of our elections and make sure we are active governors.


[29-Oct-22 11:51 AM] dehzhas#0000
On the other hand, we could decide to take a step back and let others try their hand at some of the more remote Ant planets and use more resources to further our other goals.


[29-Oct-22 11:52 AM] dehzhas#0000
In general, space politics in Ant space seem to becoming more contested.

Once we have ships to sell, we can offer a "special discount price" to anyone who lives in ANT space. And it's just the normal non-corp price


[29-Oct-22 01:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
something like... 4.5 mil for citizens of antares, 5.0 mil for everyone else. With the expectation that we're only making enough ships for ANT space anyway

If we make more than enough for ANT space... I think we are winning... whatever that means in this game

[02-Nov-22 07:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then it shows you each material, the cost for each (which you can override), and you can adjust the checkboxes to show how many upkeep materials you need to supply.. and it will show the need satisfaction based on those upkeep items.


[02-Nov-22 07:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
It shows how much satisfaction you get per AIC, so you know if it's better to provide OFF or TUB, etc.


[02-Nov-22 07:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
So as a governor you know if you need to build more buildings, which upkeep materials to supply, and a cost estimator to supply them.

[04-Nov-22 02:30 PM] allocater#0000
that's correct


[04-Nov-22 02:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you open up the script on that sheet, line 440 is a method called `getTrueHappiness`, I haven't called it, but I copied it out of another workbook

does the sheet consider the fulfillment caps? i.e. culture can never be higher than safety/health

No it doesn't.. That should be added, but I'm not exactly sure how the limit works


[05-Nov-22 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
going strictly off what's written on the fnar.net wiki, it probably caps the Needs number directly, and not the percentage, cause I've seen happiness percentages higher for technicians than settlers...

Even if there's no upkeep paid, simply having a UNI boosts the 0.002. So for technicians to engineers, it's a 20% boost in education- it's sort of like a continually running education program. It is kinda expensive though.

It's strange. Why is nike's engineers in such high demand?


[20-Nov-22 01:09 AM] churavis#0000
Probably for the same reason as Phobos, SE farming


[20-Nov-22 01:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can't wait to raise the tax of electronics engineers by a large margin, and see how much our company's dividend will increase.


[20-Nov-22 01:12 AM] churavis#0000
I plan on raising Phobos tax after the next election

The same engineer population earns one tenth of pp4 and one third less than Phobos.


[20-Nov-22 01:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest advantage is simplicity and mindlessness.


[20-Nov-22 01:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
If they like to buy FIM from HRT and come to ANT to do EDC, why doesn't OOG, as an important ruling Corp of ANT, rely on this to collect some more taxes? At least avoid hitchhiking.


[20-Nov-22 06:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that raising taxes can effectively increase dividends, which doubled this week.


[20-Nov-22 06:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
The tax base has also increased.


[20-Nov-22 06:47 PM] archielvahr#0000

My strategy is to give low-end industries a lower tax rate and high-end industries a higher tax rate. Provide tax incentives for the low-end construction industry, and collect additional taxes for SE.


[24-Nov-22 10:49 PM] churavis#0000
I believe that most fees cannot be set all the way to zero but have a minimum below which you cannot go

Election News Update!:

**Ongoing: (none look contested)**
Erix_123 on Harmonia
Churaviis on Phobos
jackinabox on ZV-759b

**Good candidates for beginners:**
Nascent (previously Allocater) - starts in a day
Ice Station Alpha (needs an ADM) 
QJ-382g (needs an ADM)

**Coming soon:**
Ant 1b: Viggle


[29-Nov-22 03:02 PM] allocater#0000

@rune_242 We've got talk in the Norwick channel from your competitor.


[01-Dec-22 08:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Am I right that we built the infrastructure on this planet?  We've certainly contributed all of the recent upkeep


[01-Dec-22 08:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
we should have run a program to fill the open Tech jobs, but other than that, things are going relatively smoothly.  Safety is low, so maybe @archielvahr could flag how we could improve that


[01-Dec-22 08:24 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm annoyed that someone is running against you without presenting a case why you should be replaced and without contributing anything to the planet


[01-Dec-22 08:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
Norwick's infrastructure construction is relatively general, resulting in unsatisfactory population growth. So I went to avalon to build FER base.


[01-Dec-22 08:34 AM] jackinabox86#0000
If people want expanded infrastructure, we could do that.  But that hasn't been requested and the new guy isn't claiming he'll do it either.

Norwick looks like it's in pretty good shape. 2 SST and 2 INFs are enough to cover the safety and health. In fact, only filling the DW should get 100% safety. Clicking through the last couple of reports, I'm guessing the SST must have been empty for a while..? The INFs get ~65% health with one upkeep item filled, and 131% with two.


[01-Dec-22 10:54 AM] rune_242#0000
I think I build all of the POPI myself


[01-Dec-22 10:55 AM] rune_242#0000

[01-Dec-22 10:56 AM] rune_242#0000
I don't think the SST was ever empty


[01-Dec-22 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hm I better double check my math


[01-Dec-22 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000

I've just started a immigration program for technicians


[01-Dec-22 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, SST with one upkeep item is 67.5% safety, with two it's 108%


[01-Dec-22 11:13 AM] churavis#0000
@archielvahr how hard do you think it would be to estimate the taxes from a planet?


[01-Dec-22 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
Sort of a lost cause. I think the best guess you have is just the base count


[01-Dec-22 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I think you could sort of do a weighted average based on average tax rate for each worker tier and the employeed population of that teir.

[01-Dec-22 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
So someone could probably make a guess by dividing 825,300 among all our governed planets. Hard to know how big a chunk of that is LM ads and warehouse fees


[01-Dec-22 11:22 AM] churavis#0000
Warehouse fees can be estimated as well based on the number of occupied units


[01-Dec-22 11:38 AM] churavis#0000
It would be useful to have a specific number to know exactly how much OOG is subsidizing planetary upkeep for elections


[01-Dec-22 11:50 AM] churavis#0000
LM fees would be impossible to estimate but they're likely to be small

[05-Jan-23 08:51 PM] dehzhas#0000
I really need it to be tended... just put down a base there with expensive pop requirements. I would be happy to step in if needed, but I would be a first time governor and my cash flow is super tight just at this moment recovering from being AFK while sick.


[05-Jan-23 09:53 PM] mrtcsmith#0000

Griffstone is more expensive to maintain than nike, and its players are more complicated. Many people in ben and HRT areas have bases there.

Happily, after I set it up, the demand for engineers in nike has indeed decreased. Maybe SE farmers find that nike doesn't welcome them.

They were considering quitting anyway?


[01-Feb-23 12:51 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm interested. Logistically I will have no trouble handling getting supplies there, I just need to investigate the POPR details and put a plan/cost together on it.


[01-Feb-23 12:52 PM] dehzhas#0000
My only financial constraint at the moment is a 3.5 million loan due in about a week (before the term would start), so I don't see that being a problem.

[02-Feb-23 12:02 PM] churavis#0000
Do you have a plan for the upkeep?


[02-Feb-23 12:04 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yep. I'm going to upgrade the safety staging and keep it topped off. The low safety is capping the higher need tiers at 34.5%.


[02-Feb-23 12:06 PM] dehzhas#0000
Outside of that, I'm going have the other buildings mostly topped off by the time my run starts.


[02-Feb-23 12:07 PM] dehzhas#0000
At least topped of to what the current governor is doing. The higher tiers seem generally stable.


[02-Feb-23 12:09 PM] dehzhas#0000
The good news is I can make a lot of the PAR inputs on site with my CHP plants, I have plenty of DW, and the corp sheet says we have 2 people who make OFF. That should mostly cover it.

Phobos's electronic engineer tax is three times as high as before, right?


[05-Feb-23 06:40 PM] churavis#0000
Looks like increasing Phobos taxes had quite the effect


[05-Feb-23 06:40 PM] churavis#0000
Yes


[05-Feb-23 06:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
In other words, the previous phobos electronic engineer tax brought us 250,000 AIC per week.


[05-Feb-23 06:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
Compared with the cost we pay for it, it is really too little.


[05-Feb-23 06:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
But it is also possible that you adjusted the tax rate in the middle of this week.


[05-Feb-23 06:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
Therefore, the income increase is not much. But there will be more next week.


[05-Feb-23 08:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
There was a 3x to 5x increase on QJ-650c in taxes that I just applied, plus we'll have Griff in 4 days


[05-Feb-23 08:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
Griff is a heavy burden, but considering that many of us have bases there, it is very good to put it in the bag.

Archiel will be governor of QJ-650c in an uncontested election. He's only got two votes though, and more would stroke his ego.

electronics ENG taxes should be 1440 universe wide. It won't do much, it's only 5% of the profits, but at least in combination with 7000 daily operating costs, it will make fully decayed EDC farms unprofitable.

Ahh okay, yeah, that might be why. Mostly I operate off 1) People's current governorships and 2) OOG inhabited planet list

I found the governor of heph really stingy.


[23-Feb-23 03:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
Heph's tax rate is higher than nike's. He gets all the tax alone, and others keep providing maintenance products to the infrastructure. As a result, the shortage of engineers and scientists can't be solved for two months.


[23-Feb-23 03:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
Although deimos also has a shortage of engineers, at least the tax rate is very low.


[23-Feb-23 04:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe it's good for us to find someone to run for the governor of heph, at least we are better than him.


[23-Feb-23 10:41 AM] allocater#0000
last time it didn't go well and he said nobody gave him hints on how to be better, so this time you can annoy him about what to do, so if he doesn't we can run against him


[23-Feb-23 02:42 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I got 205 SET on ZV-307e but I'm really not sure where the 200 came from. The immigration program hasn't finished yet. Also it says that there are 200 open SET jobs but that isn't true I only have space for 200 and jobs for 200, theoretically there should be unemployment.


[23-Feb-23 02:42 PM] allocater#0000

Can only start a program after becoming gov which happened about 3 days after settling/putting down the ADM and a program takes a week, it's got 3 days to go.


[23-Feb-23 02:46 PM] allocater#0000

Ah right, that explains it then, thanks


[23-Feb-23 02:47 PM] allocater#0000
and there were 200 open slots before the report, then 205 SET appeared, so all jobs are filled now

I would like to step down as governor of A1a (term ends in 11 days) and run as governor of Griffonstone (election starts in 16 days). I don't have a base on A1a which makes supplying it inconvenient while I visit my base on Griffonstone consistently anyway.

Election on Griff starts in 16 days, so we have plenty of time. You can put yourself in the running at any time though. Nice to have people warm up to the idea ahead of time


[14-Mar-23 04:07 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, you definitely want to have your name up when the election notification appears as many won't even think about the election afterwards and seeing no one on the ballot might give some incompetent newbie a bad idea

[14-Mar-23 08:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
Griff is more troublesome to manage than nike. I think it is the most expensive and laborious planet in ANT except phobos and heph.


[14-Mar-23 08:29 PM] yuen8241#0000

You guys have been nothing but nice and helpful to me and I returned the favor by hurting our rep.


[14-Mar-23 08:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
The governor of Griff has been changing back and forth since Pokter left, and the population is very unstable. The management cost of this planet is very expensive. I hope the next governor representing OOG can manage it well and not overdraw our reputation.


[14-Mar-23 08:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
Otherwise, I'd rather have someone else manage it well. After all, we manage too many planets and take up more and more money and energy.

I think the governor should add this information to the interface of the planet he rules, and start filling COGC  as long as the COGC is not full.


[02-Apr-23 09:22 AM] churavis#0000
There are many people that like to help by donating mats to the COGC so I have a calendar reminder that goes off a day before the COGC is due as well as a stockpile of all the MATs needed

[02-Apr-23 10:00 AM] churavis#0000
There was one week a month ago where it happened everywhere and Bobemar used it as a distraction for his own neglect of Deimos' infrastructure upkeep


[02-Apr-23 10:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
Deimos's tax rate is really low, but engineers are rising too slowly.


[02-Apr-23 10:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
I found that some people are very intolerant of us. If the population problem of deimos or heph happens to nike or phobos, it will be another rebellion.

üíØ 

[02-Apr-23 10:06 AM] churavis#0000
The dumb thing was that people had donated upkeep items to Deimos' culture, in order to get more engineers, but because Bobemar hadn't supplied enough DW to the SST, the expensive culture upkeep was totally wasted. Bobemar says he wants to rely on donations but his actions waste donations and thus discourage them


[02-Apr-23 10:08 AM] yuen8241#0000

[06-Apr-23 11:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
Tree is not a governor yet, but he has no base in A2B.


[06-Apr-23 11:30 PM] yuen8241#0000

Heh I think I sent some up after my initial COGC filling


[07-Apr-23 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
I filled up most of the COGC 6 days ago, apparently I had the wisdom to send some MCG up at that time


[07-Apr-23 10:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm just worried that you're too busy to remember. I don't doubt your wisdom.üòÜ


[07-Apr-23 10:36 AM] domicius#0000
I have loads, loads of MCG. Always


[07-Apr-23 10:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
We now manage at least 12 planets, so it is really troublesome to ensure that every COGC can work on time. Especially some players like to pick up our mistakes.


[07-Apr-23 10:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
It would be better if we can give up some planets that others can manage and focus on our own developed planets or planets that are at the core of our industry.

[15-May-23 12:10 PM] churavis#0000
The population report tells you how many of each tier are employed. You can see the predominant industry and area utilization rate by randomly clicking bases on the map screen. 

Beyond that, however, no

Do if you don't put all the required stuff into the upkeep of, for example, the wildlife park, does it not contrite at all to comfort (for eg). Do you have to contribute ALL the items in the upkeep list?

Eng Pop seems to be the next bottle neck. Till now I have supplied the Wildlife Park or the Art Gallery only with some bare minimum, because it wasn't necessary and I also don't produce most of the stuff needed. I switched my production to DEC, maybe that will be enough. If you can you could help supplying the Wildlife Park, because Engineers need comfort the most.

It's just not the normal phrasing; usually it's a number (i.e. 4th planet), but due to the way things are catalogued in this game, "Dth planet" actually makes sense, _if you think about it._

In most astronomy I believe they label planets by letters, only in older scifi shows do you see things like Rigel 7. Since the discovery of exo planets this century though I think they're all letters. Quick example https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b

Proxima Centauri b
Proxima Centauri b (or Proxima b), sometimes referred to as Alpha Centauri Cb, is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to the Sun and part of the larger triple star system Alpha Centauri. It is about 4.2 ly (1.3 pc) from Earth in the constellation Centaurus, making it, ...

Planets usually orbit around their* sun so it would be sun-centric


[17-May-23 08:47 AM] exeler#0000
Don't most planets orbit around a star? Or have we discovered so few exoplanets that most of the ones we know about are our neighbors?


[17-May-23 09:26 AM] sage42#0000
I read a paper that proposed there could be billions of rogue planetoids, which could account for part of the dark matter problem, but we have little to no way of detecting them. We detect exoplanets mainly by observing the shadow they cast when transiting in front of their star which was only possible in our very close neighborhood until James Webb or by the wobble caused by the center of mass of the system not being the same as the center of mass of the star, for that distance is not so much an issue. Both of these methods involves a star, which we won‚Äôt have around if we are trying to detect a rogue planet.


[17-May-23 09:27 AM] sage42#0000
So until we can find a way to go meet one, or one decides to come meet us (hopefully not) we can‚Äôt really know.


[17-May-23 01:31 PM] allocater#0000
there are these 2 galaxies that went through each other and went apart again, but their dark matter blobs combined and stayed behind, right? Would rogue planets be part of the blob or also stay with the stars ü§î


[17-May-23 05:56 PM] sage42#0000
Good question, I wouldn't be able to say, in my opinion all bets are off for what happens to matter that's not under a star's gravitational influence in an interaction as chaotic as a galactic collision.


[17-May-23 06:00 PM] sage42#0000
Just the movement within our local neighborhood is enough to send debris from the Oort cloud hurling towards the center of the solar system.


[17-May-23 10:31 PM] draconisdomini#0000
There are probably lots of rogue planetoids (though the estimates vary quite widely).  It has been pretty comprehensively demonstrated that they can't account for dark matter though.

It's been a while since the last....

üå† üå†  Space Politics Update üå† üå† 

**Incorrect Tax Entity:**
@domicius  ZV-759d
@treebear0235  ZV-639d
Both of these planets don't have OOG set as the tax collector. Taxes are minimal so it's probably not a huge deal, but it's probably best to swap the collector to OOG on the local rules anyway.


**Ongoing Elections:**
Neth_Havoc on Griff
Hernanduer on Demeter
Archiel on Elon


**Upcoming:**
üö®  Domicius on ZV-759d (starts in 7 hours, no one is running yet)
üö® Someone on Nike, election starts in 2 days

Balbar on SE-648b in 2 days 


**Potential Targets**
Top priority is keeping Nike.
KI-840c and YK-005d are smaller planets that are ungoverned but have a strong OOG presence. 
If Hern swaps to Nike, Demeter will be available.


[26-Jun-23 10:18 AM] churavis#0000
When does Hern's term on Demeter end? He might not be able to start on Nike if his Demeter term doesn't end before the Nike one starts.


[26-Jun-23 10:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
There is an active election on Demeter, so Hern should withdraw from that election. Election on Demeter ends in 5 days, and the election on Nike ends in 10 days.


[26-Jun-23 10:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
otherwise Hern will be locked in on Demeter until something like late july

Demeter is still open for 2 days, otherwise it will have no governor


[28-Jun-23 11:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Is it worth getting the governor building constructed on IIg?


[28-Jun-23 11:04 PM] churavis#0000
Does it need programs? Are there very many bases to pay taxes?


[28-Jun-23 11:05 PM] draconisdomini#0000
We're running short on PIO so it needs either that or pop infrastructure boosted


[28-Jun-23 11:05 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Only 8 bases, so not many


[28-Jun-23 11:07 PM] churavis#0000
Increased infrastructure might take weeks to have it's full effect. If your desperate for PIO now then you'll need ADM.


[28-Jun-23 11:08 PM] draconisdomini#0000
There are only 51 unemployed PIO at the moment, and I'd like to expand more


[28-Jun-23 11:09 PM] churavis#0000
You'll likely need to upgrade the SST even if you do get an ADM so you don't have to constantly rely on programs


[28-Jun-23 11:10 PM] churavis#0000
You can start by donating more DW, it looks like no one is even doing that right now


[28-Jun-23 11:11 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah.  I donated some for the last cycle but that wasn't enough by itself to get the PIO happiness above the threshold for in migration.  I'm going to ship some OFF and SUN there too and fill up all three


[28-Jun-23 11:13 PM] churavis#0000
Current happiness is based on the last four weeks of fulfilment, with the most recent weeks weighting more but it can still take a while for infrastructure fulfillment to have it's fullest effect.


[28-Jun-23 11:13 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ah, didn't know that

[01-Jul-23 01:54 PM] erklein#0000
In ~8 days, Harmonia governership will available and I don't intend on re-running. I've been keeping the taxes low to make it attractive for new players getting started but it is welcome to change for whomever takes it over. Be warned that the CogC takes around 900 DW, 1200 MCG/PE, and 600 RAT. There is enough infrastructure that you don't have to max out everything and have some choice over what to supply. I'll be leaving supplies for the next governor to be able to supply most upkeep for at least a while.

If anyone has a PRO license and is either a) interested in leaning how governing works, or b) burnt out of governing a 'real' planet and would like somewhere more pokey, I'd appreciate a locum governor for KI-401a; I'm building it up as an advanced metallurgy/electronics world in KI-space, and it needs a few more rounds of immigration to get the necessary population.  Zero taxes or POPI, just run the occasional program and send me the bill...

[19-Jul-23 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
The main things are, in order of priority: 1) make sure the COGC is filled 2) generally work towards 0 open jobs, but don't let unemployment go totally crazy, or you'll be paying upkeep on workforce that isn't working


[19-Jul-23 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
3) Chat in the planet's chat occasionally, so people remember you're a good governor


[19-Jul-23 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000

[19-Jul-23 12:27 PM] archielvahr#0000

Yup, you got it


[21-Jul-23 01:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was having some issues with the infrastructures that provide two different qualities. I had to add a new column between E/F from row 76 down on the Governor Helper page and I modified the query to "SELECT Col13, Col14, Col27 where Col4 > 0 ORDER BY Col1 asc" so it pulls in both. Then just change the supplied needs on row 66 so it adds two SUMIFs against the E and F ranges

I've been without full ENG for almost 2 months now. 
It has been a big internal debate, and Bob (quite amicably) suggested he step down "and let someone here take over".
I put my hand up to take over and, since I've openly straddled both their group and OOG all along, it's worked out quite well.

[22-Aug-23 01:36 PM] emperyan11#0000
(yes I know about the spread sheet, but not enough to know what it even all means ü§£ üò≠ )


[22-Aug-23 01:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's mostly just a balancing act - every person, whether they're working or not, uses Pop Infra resources. So you want a low buffer of unemployed, but also no open jobs (meaning people are missing workers)


[22-Aug-23 01:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
Keeping 15%>pops>4% unemployed means things are going well


[22-Aug-23 01:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
between 4-15%. Happiness >70% means immigration for the lower 3 tiers, happiness <40% means emigration. Emigrate if there are too many to reduce strain on pop infra (PI), and keep PI stocked so that the true happiness stays in that range. Unemployed pops will decrease perceived happiness, and that's fine. The sheet guides you to what the expected true and perceived happinesses are. Ideally you aim for ~55% true happiness at all levels, that way you can run a festivities and get immigrants at the lower levels if needed


[22-Aug-23 01:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
so the sheet lets you figure out how much PI you need to stock, and what's the most efficient resource for each PI cost-wise, so that you can hit that happiness number

[22-Aug-23 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
As far as Demeter specific advice goes... it's all pioneers and settlers. Pioneers and Settlers can migrate in, but Technicians and higher can't migrate in, and can only come from education (or govt programs). Planets that are pioneer and settler only are much easier to take care of. In my experience you can keep a healthy population by only running the Festival 3 project and essentially ignoring upkeep. (seems like Nyuu has totally ignored both projects and upkeep!)


[22-Aug-23 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you do need to catch up on Demeter, DW in the SST and OFF in the INF should cover it. Personally I am pretty convinced Festivals are the most cost effective option all around.

[28-Aug-23 02:51 PM] emperyan11#0000
So, the duties of a governor: set and maintain taxes, contribute too CoGC upkeep , contribute to POPI upkeep (and possibly upgrade) and?...


[28-Aug-23 02:52 PM] emperyan11#0000
There's programs and stuff yeah? For like happiness? What's the commad there?


[28-Aug-23 03:18 PM] churavis#0000
There are immigration and education programs. Education increases the number of workers that level up and is thus ideal only when you need more high tier workers and have a large population of low tier workers. Immigration is a fixed amount for any single tier, and this best for when low tier populations are smaller or also in high demand.


[28-Aug-23 03:19 PM] emperyan11#0000
I don't think Demeter is in big demand for any of that but how would I access them if I wanted to?


[28-Aug-23 03:19 PM] churavis#0000

I am strongly of the opinion you should always be running festivals 3 unless you have something else to run


[28-Aug-23 03:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
For demeter you could actually maybe skip it, just because the needs are so low


[28-Aug-23 03:22 PM] churavis#0000
The only problem with relying regularly on festivals for happiness is that it leaves you no room to do anything if an emergency arises, whereas if you rely on upkeep for regular happiness then in an emergency you can run a happiness program temporarily for an extra special boost.


[28-Aug-23 03:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess maybe I would agree but rephrase it as: it's good to have the upkeep buildings (and perhaps even stored materials) to cover happiness without the festivals... so you can pump in the extra upkeep if you have an emergency or need to run a different program


[28-Aug-23 03:27 PM] churavis#0000
Extra upkeep doesn't help much in an emergency since you have to wait maybe days until the next consumption and even then true happiness is based on the past 4 weeks of upkeep fulfillment.


[28-Aug-23 03:28 PM] emperyan11#0000
Yeah, hasn't been a lot of upkeep here...


[28-Aug-23 03:30 PM] churavis#0000
Festivals are the best for stemming the bleeding if you just want workers to stop moving away until you get the upkeep situating figured out.


[28-Aug-23 03:39 PM] emperyan11#0000
I threw a Festival to celebrate my election, lol


[28-Aug-23 03:49 PM] churavis#0000

[28-Aug-23 03:50 PM] emperyan11#0000
Just keepin' it real


[28-Aug-23 04:02 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
The spreadsheet showed me that the problem with Festivals long-term is that they bring in all types of POPs. It's fine short-term, but PIO _REALLY_ like Festivals. When you end up building 50% PIO unemployment, it's nearly impossible to build higher-tier POPs until those unemployed PIOs bugger off. Until then, the PIO will just eat all the Safety while preventing higher-tier POPs from building.

[28-Aug-23 04:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
definitely a problem!


[28-Aug-23 04:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even though each Pioneer only eats 0.05 comfort, there are so many of them they probably eat more culture than the engineers do in total ( at 0.35 comfort each)


[28-Aug-23 06:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I modified the spreadsheet a bit to see just how much the costs _really_ are for PIO, and they're only lik 7x more expensive than a SCI


[28-Aug-23 06:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
and that's on the conservative end, depending on the spread it could be as little as 4x more expensive. Yet we tax SCI typically 140x


[28-Aug-23 06:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
you can get into some arguments about needs/wants or even some political discussion about "oh well the rich capitalists can afford it" üôÇ but I just find it an interesting point


[28-Aug-23 11:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's assuming all the life support needs are free?  Hmm that's an interesting finding, and a good reason to increase PIO taxes


[28-Aug-23 11:07 PM] churavis#0000
On a fertile planet, life support is free. Even on a non-fertile planet, you never bump up against life support limits until you have a massive number of unemployed workers.


[28-Aug-23 11:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, that's definitely my findings as well- I guess I should rephrase: half of Pioneers needs are filled from the free life support, so they are reasonably happy with nothing but life support


[28-Aug-23 11:09 PM] churavis#0000
Being able to breathe is quite nice


[28-Aug-23 11:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess getting PIOs to 70% vs. scientists to 70% changes that 1:7 ratio compared to working to get them both to 100%

So you're saying Bob changing the tax rate on Deimos to be high-tier friendly is in line with actual costs?


[29-Aug-23 01:24 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
On that, Bob has decided to hang around as governor. I suspect it's what is keeping him in the game.


[29-Aug-23 01:25 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Which means I changed my AGRI base and opened up a FP base (that was meant to handle consumables) for nuttin.


[29-Aug-23 08:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
lame


[29-Aug-23 08:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, free life support. Because it's an AIC per satisfaction basis, if you use more expensive things for more SCI leaning stuff, it obviously skews towards the higher tier pops. Here's what Nike looks like with my current configuration. Red box is cost per satisfaction, while the indigo box is cost per pop

The more settlers the more techs an education event will give


[30-Aug-23 09:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
education is roughly constant based on the lower tier's population. Then techs also migrate as a percent of happiness over 70%. So if their happiness is 100% they'll migrate 30% of the population in (well, that's how PIO work, not sure if SET and TEC have different ratios)


[30-Aug-23 09:16 AM] domicius#0000
Correct. You're good.

That is under the Local Rules (fees tab) click edit and change the  "Fee collector" dropdown


[30-Aug-23 10:47 AM] domicius#0000
Remember too that dividend payouts are shared evenly over Corp members, and NOT in proportion to how they're paid in.


[30-Aug-23 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, my thought was: Over all players, the sum of the taxes paid out equals the sum of the dividends received. Many people get no dividends, and governors with solo corps get much more dividends than they pay in taxes. OOG is a bit unique and falls somewhere in the middle.


[30-Aug-23 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess we have 33 members and 9 governors, if I coutned correctly


[30-Aug-23 11:33 AM] fremen45#0000
I am interested in being a governor at some point but I want to make sure I get a good cash flow scheme up and running.

No one else wants to build an entire electronics production line around supplying the planet's upkeep


[31-Aug-23 02:12 PM] fremen45#0000
Does anyone use drones in planetary upkeep? Or are they just too expensive?


[31-Aug-23 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
it is very rare to use any buildings other than SST, INF, PAR for Safety, Health, and Comfort. So... no one really uses drones ever


[31-Aug-23 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
I've been thinkin about using drones for Phobos upkeep but only because that would be more fun than just selling my excess drone products to the MM, which is what I do now


[31-Aug-23 02:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
here's a comparison of the  $ / Satisf, compare them within other buildings of the type:

[04-Sep-23 07:20 PM] churavis#0000
I guess nobody cared that he raised taxes while providing the same or less upkeep?


[04-Sep-23 07:22 PM] tuffyless#0000
True, he did raise the taxes


[04-Sep-23 07:23 PM] tuffyless#0000
Guess not so much that caught my attention.


[04-Sep-23 07:24 PM] tuffyless#0000
Might call that herd-mentality.


[04-Sep-23 07:25 PM] tuffyless#0000
He said he was taking quite a loss so therefore raised taxes to help compensate.


[04-Sep-23 07:26 PM] churavis#0000
Yeah, so was OOG, we just don't care about perfectly balancing the budget.


[04-Sep-23 07:27 PM] tuffyless#0000
Yeh, i now know.


[04-Sep-23 07:31 PM] tuffyless#0000
I suspect OOG has more of an infrastructure to support/absorb than caskman.


[04-Sep-23 07:40 PM] tuffyless#0000
Would OOG lower the taxes back to where they were?


[04-Sep-23 07:48 PM] tuffyless#0000
It'd help the with the campaign speech.  ü§î 
caskman won by many votes, not just a few.


[04-Sep-23 07:54 PM] exeler#0000
I'm okay with letting Caskman keep trying. We can keep a close eye on contributions and see if the planet looks like it's gonna stay operational. 

If he starts to slip up though, I wouldn't mind stepping in. Harmonica is my first base and still is the core of my whole production chain. If I lost my Harmonia base I'd end up buying so much Carbon from the CX I'd go bankrupt


[04-Sep-23 07:55 PM] exeler#0000
Or just truckloads and truckloads of HCP that would also bankrupt me.


[04-Sep-23 07:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
he finally did a big dump of resources into the POPI


[04-Sep-23 08:17 PM] tuffyless#0000
He said he backlog of mat's for donation since OOG beat him to the punch before.  Ref: 08/08/23


[04-Sep-23 08:38 PM] hernanduer#0000
Harmonia has so many bases and such a low tech population that it'd have to be without popi for a good while to impact anyone


[04-Sep-23 08:56 PM] churavis#0000
By the time it's impact anyone we'll have to wait until the next election, plus another month to get things stable again

[10-Sep-23 02:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's unemployment with Techs so it's probably fine.... it's only 170 extras, so they will go fast if someone opens a new base.. but it's a small planet so that's fine, in my opinion. Unless we know someone is planning something specific (or the planet is gonna turn into an EDC planet üòâ )

üå† üå†  Space Politics Update üå† üå† 

**Tax Rate Update**:
Several planets in ANT space under several governors have increased taxes recently. The new standard tax rate is similar to Nike / Heph / Griffonstone, and ramps up for higher tier workers. Consider changing your taxes to match, even if you have a small planet.

**Incorrect Tax Entity**:
@draconisdomini  at Nascent
@mrsmith33  at OE-568j
@melon164  at KI-401a

The game defaults new governors to the wrong tax entity. Please change the "Tax Collector" on the local rules page of your planet to OOG. Otherwise tax income disappears. Click the edit button to show the dropdown on the Local Rules tax page. Ask if you have questions!

It's nice to have it set even for very small or new planets.

**Candidate Planets**:
**SE-110b** is currently uninhabited, but will soon be our HYF planet. It will need a governor! It'll be an easy job, speak up if you are interested. 

Ice Station Alpha itself is always a possibility. It seems well governed by Harpercz of FCST but ISA is 31% OOG members. (11 bases out of 41!)

**Ongoing Elections**:
Demeter: Emperyan
Griffonstone: Neth_Havoc
Elon / QJ-650c: Archiel

**Coming soon**:
ZV-759d, Domicius in 3 days
Nike, Hernanduer, in 5 days
Deimos, Paris_In_Springtime in 13 days, 4 people running
Phobos, Churaviis in 13 days
Norwick, Rune-Cailliau, in 14 days
Nascent, DraconisDomini in 17 days
ZV-639d, martinc1194 in 20 days, not running yet
ZV-307a, Higgsy in 22 days

üéâ Great work everyone!  The governance reach and political power of OOG has never been stronger! Thanks to everyone who has taken a role and helped out! üéâ


[15-Sep-23 09:32 AM] mrsmith33#0000

We don't actually get any reporting of how the tax gets collected


[15-Sep-23 09:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000

Do you have an objection in principle to zero taxes?


[15-Sep-23 09:44 AM] mrsmith33#0000
We are just redistributing melon's money between corp members. I see no point

No particular objection- my main goal is to make sure non-OOG member money goes into OOG. And the consistency is nice between planets

[15-Sep-23 09:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
my planet QJ-650c started growing quite a bit with a lot of non-OOG bases so I finally raised taxes there, since they were pretty flat/low to start


[15-Sep-23 09:48 AM] archielvahr#0000

The point of the dividends is to give newer players a weekly social grant to help them grow faster.


[16-Sep-23 06:35 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Then, the dividend more than helps new governors pay to run smaller planets, which is where you are.


[16-Sep-23 06:35 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Eventually, when you're running 15+ bases, the weekly dividend shouldn't be a factor anymore. At that point, the tax income from large planets pays into the pool that helps new players, and the cycle starts all over again.


[16-Sep-23 06:35 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Currently, Deimos costs me between 60k/day to run (it would cost me 140k/day to run if I bought everything off the CX). I'm happy to contribute the tax income and fund the consumables to run (and upgrade) the planet.


[16-Sep-23 06:36 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
From previous calculations, Deimos is bringing in about 35-40k/day in taxes, so even if I were getting all that tax income, it wouldn't cover the costs of running the planet.


[16-Sep-23 06:38 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
(Not to derail the convo, but this is one of the main philosophical problems the previous governor had; he believed the tax income should cover the costs, but it just doesn't work that way. It's also how we took control away from them and added Deimos to our repetoire).

@domicius I've found a pretty good way of figuring out what a planet needs: use the governor helper googledoc and try work out the least amount of consumables needed while keeping the happiness where you want it (75+ if you're growing, 50-60% if you're maintaining). Then (importantly!) ask Archiel to look it over in-case you've made a silly blunder. That's what I do!

Yeah the unemployment will do that


[24-Oct-23 07:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
yup, you got loads of extra people at each tier, so you can probably even pull back on upkeep


[24-Oct-23 08:17 AM] domicius#0000
Yup, gonna follow your advice and aim for the 60% (with festivities).

So, @tuffyless, how do we get 100 Pioneers and 1000 more Settlers on KW-688d?  I have arrived.


[06-Nov-23 12:22 PM] melon164#0000
Looks like the PIOs and ~400 SET are there already.  If you put down 1k SET jobs before POPR you'l probably get 100 more SET this week and 2-300 more next (gut instinct).


[06-Nov-23 06:31 PM] tuffyless#0000
ohh wow, another warm body is joining me on 688d. üôÇ w00t!
I dont have any POPI mats in that area right now to fuel your SET's any faster but I can make a note to bring some for next time.

Everyone should just get in the habit of running for the next election as soon as the previous one finishes, you can always withdraw later if you decide differently.

He just barely plopped down on the planet a few days ago


[22-Nov-23 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I feel like we should set up new planets for new people like that


[22-Nov-23 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
like give him something small to start with


[22-Nov-23 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
something we don't currently govern


[22-Nov-23 03:13 PM] mrsmith33#0000
YK-005d is without governor atm


[22-Nov-23 03:13 PM] churavis#0000
He wouldn't be able to properly govern a planet he doesn't have a base on so it wouldn't give him any experience really


[22-Nov-23 03:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd toss him money to make a base somewhere else üòÑ


[22-Nov-23 03:15 PM] churavis#0000
If you just don't want to be bothered with a competitive race, do the numbers and show him how much you spend on upkeep vs what you get in taxes


[22-Nov-23 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's a good suggestion


[22-Nov-23 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess I'm pretty confident we'll win


[22-Nov-23 03:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I know at the local university, when the reagent is doing a poor job or upsetting people, the university makes a search committee and finds the reagent a new job elsewhere.

They never fire a chancellor or reagent

It doesn't have an Admin center so no government possible.

If I lose on Vulcan, I might build one on YK-005d

Any reason you're contesting on Vulcan? SFScorpio is the creator of PRUNplanner, which I know we all use.
(not that it's a reason, just some background)


[24-Nov-23 12:51 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Has there been a slip-up I missed that warrants a coup?


[24-Nov-23 02:40 PM] domicius#0000
Gotta admit, I've voted the party line, but I kinda feel we shouldnt take out established governors unless we have a reason.


[24-Nov-23 05:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah it makes people mad


[24-Nov-23 05:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why I was trying to give that more neutral comment


[24-Nov-23 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh hmm yeah that‚Äôs tough. I didn‚Äôt realize who that was on Vulcan


[25-Nov-23 01:38 PM] higgsy#0000
I love prunplanner and it SHOULDN'T matter, but yeah people get mad. I am also looking to develop Vulcan so we aren't just relying on Deimos for higher tier metallurgy. That's being said, I'm heading to YK-005d now to build an Admin center. 

Looks like I'll lose the election handily and if I somehow am winning, I'd be ok with throwing it at the last hour. Good to stimulate politics chat anyway and it'll probably make Scorpio feel good to win against the bOOGiemen.


[25-Nov-23 01:40 PM] higgsy#0000
And I do think YK-005d should have an Admin center


[27-Nov-23 07:58 AM] melon164#0000
Would anyone like a sinecure governor position?  I seriously screwed up my POPI on KI-401a, and now all my TECs and ENGs are talking about things like "safe working conditions" and "reasonable work-life balance" üò°

Gotta say, I enjoyed writing that essay on Norwick. Even if no one will actually read it.


[02-Dec-23 07:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ultimately Norwick is a planet that is 80% Pioneers + 20% settlers, so the upkeep is pretty cheap and I'd be surprised if the new guy botched the planet

Ant2d election started, @domicius  you running this time?


[14-Dec-23 01:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's time for another....

üå† üå†  Space Politics Update! üå† üå† 

I finally got my sheet updated and importing data from FIO again. So here's our:

**Empty Elections:**
ZV-759d - Formerly @domicius , election ends in 5 days, no one is running right now. Anyone can hop in, I think? 

**Current Governors:**
ZV-639d - MrSmith33    (ongoing election) 
Griffonstone - NethHavoc    (ongoing election) 
Demeter - Emperyan    (ongoing election) 
Elon - Archiel
KW-668d - TuffyLess
SE-110b - Dehzhas
Phobos - Churaviis
Nike - Hernanduer     (ongoing election) 
Nascent - DraconisDomini

10 ongoing Governorships active right now, with the planet tracker sheet reporting a governed population of 909,476 citizens! 

**Player Activity Report:** 
I used to track this, but since the change to how activity ratings were made in game, I don't have this info. Hopefully we can get this back up sometime so we can match recruiting to activity levels.

**ANT Region Governance:**
Governance of minor planets is on a bit of a decline in the region. The following planets have strong OOG presense, already have an ADM, but have no governor:

SE-648b (BER planet, formerly ours)
IY-206j (BRM planet, very very small, but 40% OOG)
Aratora ( small BTS planet)

No ADM:
KI-840c


[14-Dec-23 01:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Other planets in the region seem to be well cared for. Sorted by number of OOG bases:
Harmonia by caskman (25 OOGers)
Norwick by marismols (18 OOGers) - new governor, someone to watch
Heph by RisefoFilth (16) - loudest guy in ANT 
Etherwind by Rwinner16 (14) - he is upgrading all the POPI to max just for fun I guess
Ice Station Alpha by Harpercz (11)
Vulcan by SFScorpio (7) - he makes Prunplanner

These are mostly low-tier worker planets so it's pretty hard for the governor to mess em up. I think they're generally all well-liked, so if we want to move on any of these planets, it would be good to reach out and get an endorsement from their outgoing governor first.

[14-Dec-23 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
We've also got a few members who are using a company code used by someone else who had previously left the game, and FIO can't really figure that out


[14-Dec-23 02:33 PM] cleavingambiguity#0000
In the game, Higgsy's corporation is not OOG, but the planet's governing entity is our corporation. Why is that?


[14-Dec-23 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I can't get Fremen45 or ONS to show up ever in my sheets


[14-Dec-23 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm, she shows up as OOG for me


[14-Dec-23 02:35 PM] cleavingambiguity#0000
My mistake. I mistook his company name as the corporation.


[14-Dec-23 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000

There's an open election on Ant I e (ZV-307e) nice small planet that would be easy to run. And it has a small high tech pop so it could benefit from a governor. It is a manufacturing planet.

[18-Dec-23 01:08 PM] cleavingambiguity#0000
Thank you. So, there are about three days left before more population is distributed.


[18-Dec-23 01:13 PM] higgsy#0000

[18-Dec-23 01:34 PM] cleavingambiguity#0000

Education only works better if you have a large population in the tier just below and I don't think you have enough settlers for that but you can double check with the governor's helper spreadsheet to be sure.


[28-Dec-23 07:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Report 59 has 16,104 pioneers. Report 60 has 16,871 pioneers, so it grew by 767 which is 500 + 367


[28-Dec-23 07:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
367 is the natural growth, the 500 was the immigration


[28-Dec-23 07:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
report 61 has 17162, which is 291, which means... that immigration didn't show up for the number, which is- I agree- very puzzling


[28-Dec-23 07:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
The government program does show up there, so it's pretty weird. I wonder if it's a bug


[28-Dec-23 07:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
or it happened late enough that it somehow didn't count in the report? That's weird though


[17-Jan-24 01:50 AM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000

It's time for another....

üå† üå†  Space Politics Update! üå† üå† 

Current Governors:
ZV-639d - MrSmith33 
Griffonstone - NethHavoc
Demeter - Emperyan 
Elon - Archiel
Nascent - DraconisDomini
KW-668d - TuffyLess
Phobos - Churaviis
Nike - Hernanduer     (ongoing election) 
YK-005d - Higgsy

Ongoing contested elections:
SE-648a - @xfeuerdrachenx  vs. bazdakla. It's 4-3 now and I think all our members have voted. 

New Planets that need governors:
SE-110a
SE-110d
SE-110b (formerly Dehz)

A and D are totally fresh and will probably need pioneer jobs run. These elections are open right now, and they are great starter planets. There won't be much to do here except run immigration jobs. 

Regionally, not much has changed since the last report. I think people have been a bit slower to run for planets lately, I'm suspecting a lot of older players are in semi-retirement. 

People are now running on both Norwick and Malahat.

@xfeuerdrachenx is on 648b and can run there.
Im not running again on 688d so can run on 110a.
Molssoft already has a 9-vote lead on Norwick; would be tough for Rune being so delayed.

There were planets in need of a governor.


[23-Jan-24 05:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
What all goes into governing a planet? I think it'd be interesting to try once I have a bit more spare cash around


[23-Jan-24 06:20 PM] domicius#0000
Cash. Lots of cash. And expensive items that are hard to buy, or cheap items that you have to buy by the hundreds.


[23-Jan-24 06:21 PM] domicius#0000
Otherwise it's ok


[23-Jan-24 06:22 PM] sidepipe#0000

[23-Jan-24 06:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe more like a lot of spare cash, then üòÑ


[23-Jan-24 06:32 PM] churavis#0000
That's only for high-tier pop planets, for planets with mostly pioneers and settlers, which are most of them, it's not that bad


[23-Jan-24 07:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
The small planets are very easy to start with and require almost nothing.

Oh, that‚Äôs not bad at all. I might look into building a base on SE-110d - maybe I could run for gov next time around


[23-Jan-24 08:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Assuming no one more qualified wants it üòÑ


[23-Jan-24 08:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also you can run without having a base there!


[23-Jan-24 08:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
although it is convenient


[23-Jan-24 08:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
especially these fresh planets just need immigration tasks run, they don't need a base and someone else can fill the COGC


[23-Jan-24 09:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
SE-110a is open now, and Tuffy wanted to eventually run there. 110b is open, 110d has a FICSIT person that will probably do fine


[23-Jan-24 09:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
And Ant 1a, (ZV-307a) has an inactive governor


[23-Jan-24 09:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Wow he's got an F rating too, heh


[29-Jan-24 09:34 AM] emperyan11#0000
Been talking a bit with a jvaler in game and they're asking about coordinating some trade and communication with us. What's the best route for them to reach out?


[29-Jan-24 10:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Do you know what they are specifically looking for? Usually those kinds of deals end up happening between individual members


[29-Jan-24 10:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
We don't have a guest channel because we'd need to set up  roles and whatnot. It had been discussed in the past, but there wasn't a ton of appetite for it I think.


[29-Jan-24 10:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
But we could just mark almost all our channels as "OOG Shareholder"


[29-Jan-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
It might be nice to bit a bit more robust with roles if we end up having more robust recruitment rules.


[29-Jan-24 03:15 PM] emperyan11#0000
I dunno, they want to make a "food industry COGC" on Hermes  and asked me if it would be ok. I'm like, fill your boots, I'm only the governor of Demeter not the Master of Space


[29-Jan-24 03:18 PM] emperyan11#0000
I guess they're hoping to start up some trade on Demeter since it's "close"


[29-Jan-24 04:57 PM] archielvahr#0000

[06-Feb-24 02:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
And we wouldn't need to upkeep it hardly at all until the unemployment got down to 10%


[06-Feb-24 02:06 PM] allocater#0000
but its unclear if the planet has a future, because it only does EDC/IDC


[06-Feb-24 02:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you think people will take down existing bases? I sort of suspect no one will bother until they are nerfed into an actual loss


[06-Feb-24 02:09 PM] allocater#0000
they should make the calculation every day based on R-fabs in and consumables in, but yeah, atm it's still profitable, only taxes or another dev nerf could push it into negative


[06-Feb-24 02:10 PM] allocater#0000
would be interesting to actually make them pay the popi and see how far profit goes down


[06-Feb-24 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, what a weird planet. I think they were aiming for 100% need fulfillment all the time. and almost no taxes


[06-Feb-24 02:12 PM] allocater#0000
yup heavily subsidized EDC farm


[06-Feb-24 02:13 PM] allocater#0000
which we collected üòÑ


[06-Feb-24 02:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it would pull a lot of income, lemme do some quick math


[06-Feb-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
employed: 15000 engineers, 5000 scientists. That's 500 SE and 250 SL. At Phobos tax rates that's ~850 AIC per SE building per day and 1500 AIC per SL... so 3,050,000 AIC per week


[06-Feb-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
that's the upper bound though. Phobos probably pulls in more like $1m, but it has half the  engineers and 1/3rd the scientists (although more pop total)


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm kind of tempted. But I'd have to withdraw from Elon within the day, and it would be nice to have someone else govern there. Although I'm sure it would manage.


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ideally someone else from OOG takes Malahat üòâ


[06-Feb-24 02:19 PM] allocater#0000
you could give Elon to someone else


[06-Feb-24 02:20 PM] allocater#0000

[06-Feb-24 02:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay, anyone here want Elon? Fairly easy planet to run. I'll throw some OFF and MHP and such at you too

[07-Feb-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000

[07-Feb-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
If so, I'll take Malahat


[07-Feb-24 10:53 AM] emperyan11#0000

[07-Feb-24 10:53 AM] melon164#0000

[07-Feb-24 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
actually nope, only to vote


[07-Feb-24 11:04 AM] emperyan11#0000
I could run it for a month or two if that takes the bind off then


[07-Feb-24 11:05 AM] emperyan11#0000
Weird... can you not be governor of more than one planet?


[07-Feb-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
You can only govern one


[07-Feb-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
They are going to change that in some form after the next update


[07-Feb-24 11:31 AM] emperyan11#0000
Ah. I withdraw my hand as temporary oppressor of Elon then. I'm not giving up my garden world!


[07-Feb-24 11:32 AM] emperyan11#0000
Also, how am I supposed to create a shadow empire if I can't run more than one planet? ü§™


[07-Feb-24 11:32 AM] mrsmith33#0000
government update is going to change that


[07-Feb-24 11:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
But each planet is gonna have some sort of "council". so really you'll be councillor on like 10 planets


[07-Feb-24 11:52 AM] emperyan11#0000

[07-Feb-24 01:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looks like lukeskye is interested. I know him a bit. I did several loans for him and he's got a good brain generally. I did try to invite him to OOG but he had plans to start his own corp


[07-Feb-24 01:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
looks like he hasn't done so, so maybe I will try again.


[16-Feb-24 10:28 AM] allocater#0000
@archielvahr so have you calculated the new tax rate for Malahat yet?


[16-Feb-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am gonna pump it up, but I haven't told anyone yet


[16-Feb-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
I actually figured I would just mimic phobos


[16-Feb-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
because that makes it easier to swallow generally


[16-Feb-24 11:19 AM] churavis#0000
Phobos' taxes are not well calculated and I make no guarantees that they'll pay for the upkeep of either planet


[16-Feb-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
I was considering waiting for Plexurca to wrap up before changing the rates, I wasn't sure what his expectations are regarding keeping the planet going


[16-Feb-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
I suppose I could do a proper upkeep writeup. I do have a per-tier breakout of costs

Note that this is a draaaaaastic reduction in upkeep. Plex probably paid double or more in upkeep than this

It's still 40% subsidizing the planet. This could be phased out and target a tax rate of 100% of the costs, or even 110% so you earn money for your logistics services.


[25-Feb-24 10:32 AM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Feb-24 01:19 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I've run the numbers myself and I think to cover the upkeep costs you would be looking at about 110 AIC for SCI and 140 AIC for ENG


[25-Feb-24 01:19 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm assuming all the SCI are in SL producing IDC and all the ENG are in SE producing EDC


[25-Feb-24 01:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
For SCI that means 405 productive buildings (8112 employed SCI at 20/building).  That would mean 179 AIC/day to cover upkeep, but most of those buildings will be operating at ~170% efficiency.  That would drop it down to 100 AIC/production if everyone is producing IDC, but the other products take longer, so something around 110 AIC is probably about right


[25-Feb-24 01:25 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Same thing for ENG, except that SE take 30 ENG/building so the tax yield per pop is lower requiring a higher production fee


[25-Feb-24 01:30 PM] draconisdomini#0000
75.9% employment means 552 productive SE, so 212 AIC/day to cover upkeep.  Again, most of those buildings would be operating at ~170% efficiency, dropping the fee down to about 125 AIC, but as before EDC is actually the shortest production time, so probably something around 140 AIC would be right


[25-Feb-24 01:32 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Right now, my 18 SE will be resulting in 40,487 AIC/d in taxes, which would by itself cover one third of the ENG costs


[25-Feb-24 01:46 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That's how I did the calculations for Nascent which got me to about 15 AIC for PIO.  I set it at 20 since Nascent is still expanding and I am paying for infrastructure upgrades too


[25-Feb-24 01:56 PM] tuffyless#0000
You could always come on back to Elon Archy!  
haha, this lukeskye guy too.  :\

[25-Feb-24 02:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah we should try to recruit lukeskye. He is a good guy generally. I think he's generally right about getting higher tiers though, it is kind of inevitable to have a surplus at lower tiers.


[25-Feb-24 02:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Malahat with 50% unemployed scientists though ü§Ø


[25-Feb-24 02:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Does that account for the 50% unemployment?


[25-Feb-24 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh I see it does


[25-Feb-24 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm, so tax rates don't scale by the number of workers in a building, I wonder if that's a mistake I made


[25-Feb-24 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
A BMP is 100 pioneers and a FRM is 50... if they both do a 1 day recipe they pay the same taxes...?


[25-Feb-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well it seems like it would be weird to go under Phobos / Nike / Heph rates


[25-Feb-24 03:01 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yep.  This is an issue.  You have to assume an average number of pops per building.  For Nascent I assume 50 PIO/building since INC is 40 and EXT is 60


[25-Feb-24 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
And I'm guessing Malahat is all SL (20 scientists) and SE (30 eng)


[25-Feb-24 03:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
so even lower


[25-Feb-24 03:03 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That was my assumption


[25-Feb-24 03:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Phobos, Nike and Hephaestus have much larger PIO and SET populations, which the higher tier workers are subsidising


[25-Feb-24 03:06 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I presume the TECH and ENG on Nike are also mostly in PP3 and PP4 which have higher worker counts


[25-Feb-24 03:35 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Phobos is probably a weird case because of being a starter planet, but assuming 50 PIO/building and 2 productions/day that would mean the PIO fee should be about 50-60.  It is actually 15, because it is being heavily subsidised by the higher tier pops


[25-Feb-24 03:43 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That's also because the consumable mix at Phobos is a bit weird


[25-Feb-24 03:47 PM] draconisdomini#0000
At Nike, assuming it is all construction buildings, the PIO would be split between PP1 (80/building), PP2 (25/building) and UPF (20/building), probably mostly PP1 and PP2.  There are also probably some BMP with 100 PIO/building.  So it probably averages out to 40-50 PIO/building.  For PP1 and PP2 most productions are around 6 hours base, so with efficiency you are probably getting 5 productions per day.  That would mean that to make up the PIO upkeep the fee on Nike should probably be about 20-25 with the current consumable mix


[25-Feb-24 05:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got a new sheet:

[25-Feb-24 05:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
That fixes up the assumption that the tax rates were per 100 workers per day


[25-Feb-24 05:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
which more or less lines up with the numbers others were throwing out


[25-Feb-24 05:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
No surprise that all the EDC farmers come out hard on tax math üòõ


[25-Feb-24 05:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well I made a misstep with the math. I think I calculated those initial rates with what essentially worked out to 100 pop per building, because of that "Cost per 100 workers" I had.


[25-Feb-24 05:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
So now it's hard to justify the high taxes to pull down EDC production, cause I can't change my argument mid-discussion


[25-Feb-24 05:52 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah, that immediately pumps up what you would think the SCI fee should be by a factor of 5

Much easier to cover expenses on malahat than elon, I guess primarly due to the worker-per-building count being lower.

Wow


[11-May-24 03:32 AM] melon164#0000
Would anyone care to be a sinecure govenor on OE-568j?  Zero cost, just run some programs and bill me for them.


[11-May-24 04:08 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I need the same for ZV-194d


[11-May-24 04:08 AM] allocater#0000
the way workers are distributed to bases during shortage is still a mystery, right?


[11-May-24 04:27 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Hopefully devs release politics update soon, and I will be a gov on multiple planets


[11-May-24 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
It‚Äôs supposed to be a round robin but I don‚Äôt really know how it is applied. It always seemed like people retain all their workers they already had and the new workers are split evenly among existing open jobs. What happens when workers are lost isn‚Äôt clear though.


[11-May-24 02:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, it seems like if new workers are added, they're added round-robin and none are removed from existing bases. If workers are lost, they're lost from the companies using the most first, again in round robin if equal # of employees


[11-May-24 02:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
there seems to be some sort of balancing too, if there's a new base and also workers are lost next cycle, the new base will still get a very small amount of new workers

[11-May-24 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I guess it's described a bit here:

25% of your workers return to the pool to be reallocated each time


[11-May-24 06:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ah yeah there you go, and that applies to everyone I guess, and then is re-round robin out to all players


[11-May-24 06:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
So if there's a loss of workers and your new base doesn't put you in the top users of that particular worker class, you can expect probably 25% of missing workers. Unless the reduction is taken from that pool after the 25%, then the pool will be smaller


[11-May-24 06:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
So a new base would potentially get less than 25%... Ah confusing


[12-May-24 01:40 AM] allocater#0000
Next week will be some good data, because there will be 1000 missing ENG and we get data on 2 new bases and 15 old bases  ü§ì


[12-May-24 06:10 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Life (ZV-896c, Harmonia system) also does not currently have a governor.  Not sure if Rise is looking for someone else to fill in

Will have a proper look around tonight and get my bearings


[13-May-24 05:44 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
in terms of local taxes and fees for a planet, when and how much should you put them up by, if any?
i'm not trying to run a tax haven or anything ü§£


[13-May-24 05:45 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
just not sure when/if it's needed to put them up?


[13-May-24 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
that wouldn't do much due to shared OOG tax


[13-May-24 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
best to leave as is, the dividend is like nearly 300k so that should be enough for A2G


[13-May-24 06:06 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
gotcha thanks, but in theory, higher the tax, the more money you would rake in as gov?


[13-May-24 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[13-May-24 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
although too high and people get annoyed


[13-May-24 06:12 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
yeah thats fair enough


[13-May-24 06:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
There is a tax estimation section in my governor's guide, but it's very hard to deal with and it's a lot of guesswork. You can calculate what percentage of your production value ends up going into a taxed product. For PIOs it's usually under 1%


[13-May-24 06:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Plus a PIO only planet is very cheap, since you won't ever supply education, culture, or the expensive needs


[13-May-24 06:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
and safety and health are partly provided by bases


[13-May-24 06:27 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
that's alright then, not too bad, i've just spend a few $$$ on supplies to stock up the safety station and infirmary for a few weeks and i got supplies for the CoGC too


[13-May-24 06:28 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
so i think i've done alright picking an easy planet to start on and learn the basics ig

[15-May-24 06:33 PM] churavis#0000
The happier people are, the more they will tell their friends and family to come, the less happy they are, the more they will leave. If you want less unemployment then simply stop fulfilling their needs as much and people will leave.

So as far as Sidepipe's governor question:


[19-May-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anything marked by Heph is managed by Rise, and touching those will be a hornet's nest of complaining


[19-May-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
If he has someone retire, I'm sure he'd be okay with us taking them over, but it'd be tough to organize that generally


[19-May-24 06:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Vulcan is run by a Kawa person right now, we can keep an eye on that. It's gone back and forth through a few people. It's gonna be almost entirely PIOs so it can't really go wrong


[19-May-24 06:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Although 1% unemployment ATM


[19-May-24 06:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
FCST has done well on SE-110 so I have no complains there unless one of those opens up


[19-May-24 06:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Aratora has been getting random do-nothing governors for a while, but it's small enough not to really matter


[19-May-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
as far as planets without a governor but having an ADM, there's IY-206j, LS-746b, QJ-382c. I don' tthink any of those are a prority


[19-May-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
so I'd probably just keep an eye out for something big that frees up in the next few weeks


[19-May-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

Life (Harmonia system) is managed by Rise (not well in my opinion) and is currently without a governor since his proxy did not stand in the last election.  Not sure whether that was a mistake or whether they have decided to retire.


[21-May-24 05:38 PM] sidepipe#0000

[21-May-24 05:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or I can just run and see if he complains. I was hoping to snap up a larger planet, but if there's a lot of OOG bases on Life it probably makes more sense to run there

ok so for YK-005d should I change the fees at all? I've got it set to OOG and not Antares Initive. Should I lower resource extraction fees?

The highest fee I've got for my H2O extraction is 20 on ISA, not sure how it works for other resources but with it set at 20 AIC I'm paying 4.40 per order for each of my 72 rigs which totals to about 2.4k / day which is essentially nothing.  I've set the fee to a token 1 AIC on the little 2 player planet I govern as it's not much maintenance at all but assuming the costs of it is about the same for other resource extractions I don't think 20 AIC is too high of a fee, especially for a planet with a higher upkeep cost ‚úåÔ∏è

Agreed. Extraction planets and low tier planets tend to be very very low tax no matter what so I think that‚Äôs totally reasonable

I have Nascent set at 20 AIC, which I calculated covers the upkeep and occasional infrastructure upgrades.

I am happy to announce to all @OOG Shareholder s that we have reached one million workers under the governance of OOG! Great work to our current governors (that the sheet can find):

Paris  -  Deimos
Hern  - Nike
Neth_Havoc  - Griff
Turlorn  - Norwick
Churaviis  - Phobos
Emperyan - Demeter
Draconis - Nascent
MrSmith33 - ZV-639d
Domicius - ZV-759
martinc1194 - SE-648b
me  - Malahat
Hal98, king of HAL mining - Halcyon

I am also thrilled this comes with an all time high dividend of** $8,607,790** AIC, bringing our total governance income since 2022-10-23 to **322 million**! (If you are idle and sitting on a pile of cash, invest it with allocater in the OOG bank, which is now up to 23 EDC/IDC bases!)

How governments will work after the politics update
Hey everyone,  we are close to the release of our politics themed update. If you follow our dev logs you might already know a lot about the upcoming changes, but judging from discussions and comments on Discord and our test server there are a lot of open questions how everything is supposed to work after the release hits.  So here is a quick wri...

Rise is probably doing backflips with that change


[04-Jun-24 08:54 AM] zipatsu#0000
Might be misunderstanding it but does that mean that if a small group of friends / business partners decides to run for MP and then all vote for their own group that, unless the main gov. being voted on has 2 / 4 other players that are willing to run, you could essentially take over a planet, raise the taxes and just pay it out to each other while only having had a small amount of votes?

Basically wondering if it means that now you not only have to become to governor, you also need other trustworthy players to run to keep things secure ü§î

I think you‚Äôre pretty much right. Does anyone know if you‚Äôll be able to vote for multiple players for MP?


[04-Jun-24 09:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Especially given how few players vote right now, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how common takeovers like that become


[04-Jun-24 09:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess I'm expecting one vote per player, most votes becomes Governor. I foresee a couple of consequences:
* It'll be easier to shift around a few votes last-minute to pop up from MP to governor somewhere. Elections will become more fluid.
* Anyone who wants to can get a single vote for themselves and become a MP somewhere (or many wheres).
* A very few people, like Rise, are gonna be on 20 planets


[04-Jun-24 09:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
It might be interesting to look at base counts for some of our planets, just to see if we have enough votes to guarantee a gov


[04-Jun-24 09:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
* If you have a group of people responsible for upkeep of a planet.. then no one is really responsible for it. So regardless of the MPs, the governor is probably the "responsible one" just as before. Then the MPs just become a position you take for funsies


[04-Jun-24 09:19 AM] archielvahr#0000

OOG - Organized Organized Gamers


[04-Jun-24 09:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think sharing a base with Rise will be tough, because he will probably contest/complain about every payout that is attempted. And it sounds like filling the mats is a free-for-all, just like it is now... there's no particular control/support for upkeep, just control on the outflow of money


[04-Jun-24 09:22 AM] zipatsu#0000
31% on ISA? that's way more OOG than I thought was there


[04-Jun-24 09:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do think the changes are probably good for the game and maybe good for us overall... It is true that we lose a toooooooon of tax income that just goes to inactive members of OOG


[04-Jun-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
We're kinda at a place where 1/3rd to 1/2 of people who quit playing end up giving stuff back to the corp


[04-Jun-24 09:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
right now he gets hundreds of thousands while maintaining some small planets


[04-Jun-24 09:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
he'll have to push for payouts to himself on a lot of them


[04-Jun-24 09:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
I don't think he'll be that against payouts

the governor is just a regular MP except in tie breakers


[04-Jun-24 09:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
so if you have enough people to get 3/5 or 2/3 MPs, then yeah you effectively control a planet


[04-Jun-24 09:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
but how is that different than governor now?


[04-Jun-24 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, there are some planets we could probably get all the MPs for, but one big change is that all the motions are public... so the most powerful weapon is "complaining a lot". And you can do that regardless of having an MP position or not

we'll have to do some vote wrangling in corp to make sure votes are balanced accordingly


[04-Jun-24 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
governor is nice, but if that's the only position we have it hardly matters (on >24 base planets)


[04-Jun-24 09:29 AM] zipatsu#0000
Right now the governor needs majority support to get elected, but in the scenario I'm imagining you'd have Archiel with 60 votes and then Hernanduer with 20.  Then 3 friends decide to run as well for the remaining 3 MP seats, all voting for themselves (if still possible) for 3 votes each.  In that scenario, unless the Gov has enough other people to run and be voted on for seats those 3 players would have control of the planet as the majority even if they all they did was run and get a few votes each

[04-Jun-24 09:35 AM] archielvahr#0000

[04-Jun-24 09:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect 90% of the time/planets, everything will be uncontested. Packing parliament will be for the exceptions

[04-Jun-24 10:11 AM] hernanduer#0000
with 2 members, presumably if the governor goes inactive then the MP can still run the government


[04-Jun-24 10:11 AM] churavis#0000
OK, that does make sense


[04-Jun-24 10:11 AM] hernanduer#0000

The process so far is go to government screen (separate from your personal base screen), create payout motion, vote on said motion, when motion passes, go to personal screen accept contract from the government, go back to government screen and fulfill the contract

For some reason I cannot fathom, the peasants don't like to be on planets where they aren't safe or able to get medical care or sit in comfortable spaces or enjoy cultural things or get an education.


[11-Jun-24 09:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[11-Jun-24 09:53 AM] churavis#0000
Yes, they affect happiness, happiness determines migration patterns on the planet

I'd quite like a go at governership at some point. What do folks think about setting up an admin centre on KI-401d? 

I'd quite like to move my H collection there freeing up more space for INC on 759g... and the AR would line me up to be able to make INS later given I'll be making PE soon. *If I were to win a vote there it's quite small, with only 12k of PIO pop usage. The upkeep requirements would be relatively light with OFF for pop buildings, and low requirements for the COGC.*

Does this seem like a good idea, or a bad idea?


[16-Jun-24 03:07 PM] churavis#0000
I'm on KI-401d and I already produce more H than the corp needs. You can send me a contract for it on ANT where I maintain a significant stockpile

Did we get a new planet?


[16-Jun-24 11:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
The big planets haven't changed. I think this is mostly just growth. Malahat has added a lot of high value bases and that brings in a lot of tax money


[16-Jun-24 11:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Half the population of Phobos, but double the engineers, and 2.4x the scientists

[17-Jun-24 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
The base establishment tax is a one-time fee that everyone has to pay in order to be able to found a new base on a planet. The tax is part of the local rules and can be changed via a governmental motion.


[17-Jun-24 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000

[17-Jun-24 02:17 PM] churavis#0000
It would be prestigious but I feel that it might start a bad precedent that could end up with other corps locking us out of good planets. How will they stop corps from abusing this to monopolize certain resources or industries?


[17-Jun-24 02:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
that was my main concern when mentioning it too, I figured to prevent that you'd need a permanent upper limit


[17-Jun-24 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
faction space only fits more in the game I guess


[17-Jun-24 02:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
but there's some to be said of abandoned planets as well


[17-Jun-24 02:31 PM] churavis#0000
I heard a rumor about a faction before that tried to monopolize the CU market buy gaining governorship of all the major CUO planets and then setting production fees as high as possible, was anyone else around when that happened or know the full story?


[17-Jun-24 02:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
never heard of it, sounds fun though


[17-Jun-24 02:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
let's see if they implement an upper limit before we worry about private planets too much


[17-Jun-24 02:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
if anything, it might give a good reason to colonize random other planets - you're simply priced out of the others lol


[17-Jun-24 02:37 PM] churavis#0000
The blog says there'll be an upper limit only in faction space, with some planets (I assume starters) having no base fee possible at all


[17-Jun-24 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
So valuable non-faction planets near ANT:
Etherwind, Electronica, Demeter, a handful of extraction bases. further away is Malahat.


[17-Jun-24 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess there aren't that many.


[17-Jun-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then there's a handful of resource taps, some might have strategic importance but probably something you could work around in a pinch


[17-Jun-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Faction planets do have limits on their "unlimited" stuff. 9999 for LMs and 10,000 for warehouse fees. taxes can actually go pretty nuts. 9999 for pioneers, 119,988 for engineers, and 219,978 for scientists. Those tax values are well beyond what is required for malice


[17-Jun-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
that's like... wake up and lose a couple mil


[17-Jun-24 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
So anyway, if the devs put in a max of 100k it probably won't slow anyone down

```Instead, leverage an establishment tax that any new base must pay. This primarily is for newer worlds lacking large populations, where a single base can significantly impact the POPs of existing bases. You may or may not want to add an upper bound to prevent arbitrary gating of planets by raising establishment taxes to some extreme number (20M or something.)```


[18-Jun-24 11:07 AM] churavis#0000
Will there be a way to embezzle funds from a government to private pockets now that the finances are separated? If not, or even if it's difficult, no single corp is going to want to raise taxes to a prohibitory amount since they would have to pay them too. If they couldn't recover the money for themselves then they'd be hurt just as bad as anyone else, more so since they'd have to have a popular majority in order to maintain control of the government.


[18-Jun-24 11:08 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[18-Jun-24 03:30 PM] exeler#0000

[18-Jun-24 03:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[18-Jun-24 03:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can title motions


[18-Jun-24 03:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So you could title it ‚ÄúPayout for CoGC Upkeep‚Äù or something to divert attention from your embezzling


[18-Jun-24 03:34 PM] akyantor#0000
Or just inflate the cost that you pay for goods... i.e. governership margin üòõ


[18-Jun-24 03:38 PM] churavis#0000
This is the most likely route for embezzlement, both in the new system and also IRL because most corruption and incompetence is covered up through complexity and boringness, not bribes or any kind of subterfuge.


[18-Jun-24 03:39 PM] akyantor#0000
It would seem the obvious route tbh

Honestly weekly payouts for 15 delivered upkeep items at various prices, when it's really hard to find what was actually contributed means the auditing process will be pretty opaque unless someone is really putting work in. Which they will, but only if they want to complain üòõ

I didn't think stocking the CoGC would change that way yet?


[18-Jun-24 05:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
I can check


[18-Jun-24 05:09 PM] churavis#0000
They're changing how everything else is stocked, why not the CoGC?


[18-Jun-24 05:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
actually I can't because no one's built a CoGC on the test server


[18-Jun-24 05:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think they're holding off on the stock changes


[18-Jun-24 05:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
since they couldn't decide on the POPI, I figured the CoGC fell in that same bucket


[18-Jun-24 05:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
hopefully it goes the way of storefront, where prices are set and goods are sold to the government, then the government can stock the POPI


[18-Jun-24 05:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the government gets WAR space


[18-Jun-24 05:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
but none of that is in the current planned release since they didn't want to postpone the release for the storefront mechanic (is my understanding)


[18-Jun-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the POPI filling changes aren't happening yet. And the requested "Make the COGC have a multi-week stockpile like POPI" is also pretty unlikely


[18-Jun-24 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Reading between the lines, I think they like the store-model but it's too big a change for this release


[18-Jun-24 06:17 PM] churavis#0000
So maybe they'll make those changes in not too distant future updates?


[18-Jun-24 06:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
So they've commit fairly clearly to the shield changes being part of the next "maintenance" release. Plus some of the bug fixes they have already mentioned.  They had spoken about the space elevator as coming up after that.


[18-Jun-24 06:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the storefront change is in the same category of "later" as recurring contracts and selling multiple items in one contract.


[18-Jun-24 06:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also think there were some pending resource improvements for the map that probably fell off the radar


[18-Jun-24 06:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
The added jump lanes was portrayed as a first step in the map upgrades


[18-Jun-24 06:32 PM] churavis#0000
What kind of resource improvements?


[18-Jun-24 06:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Counterpoint said: "the new thing we‚Äôre considering here is changing the actual map content (sectors, systems, planets etc.) while it‚Äôs live. "


[18-Jun-24 06:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then molp said in a dev log: "One outcome of this was, that you wanted the map to be more connected, especially in the outer regions. With this update we introduce more connections!

Please note that this is only the first step and we are looking into other map changes as well."


[18-Jun-24 06:35 PM] churavis#0000
They should add new systems but make them super hazardous to the point where they are non-viable without specialty ship shields


[18-Jun-24 06:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
So... I am trying to find it, but I think they were amenable to either a) adding new resources to uncolonized outer rim planets. or b) increasing the richness of the ones that were out there.


[19-Jun-24 10:04 AM] hernanduer#0000

[24-Jun-24 10:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay since the politics release is landing in two days... We should have some plans.

I assume planets that are currently governed will keep their governor until the next election, when the parliament itself kicks in. But the new context feature will be available immediately. I have no idea what will happen to ongoing elections. I think we should be prepared to see those elections turn into parliaments immediately, mid election.

For us, on launch day, we will have the following ongoing elections:
* Griffonstone (Neth)
* Demeter (Emperyan)
* ZV-759d (Domicius)
* ZV-639d (MrSmith)

And shortly after / same day as the update:
* Nike (Hern)

So I think we should be prepared to pack the parliament on those, especially Griff.

Griff should have a parliament of 3, Nike will be 5. 

Theoretically, we effectively control a planet if we have 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 parliament members, so having the member is more important than having the governor slot (the parliamentarian with the most votes, who breaks ties). I sort of expect that the governor is still the one with the responsibility, but we'll see how that works out.


[24-Jun-24 10:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Demeter will have a parliament of 3. ZV-759d will have 3 members, ZV-639d will have 2.


[24-Jun-24 10:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
So let's collect some volunteer parliament members for each of those planets, to help out our existing governors

I would say that if anyone is at all interested in either, run on them. Right now you can only start running if you aren't governor, but before those elections end, they will be parliaments


[25-Jun-24 08:15 AM] akyantor#0000
Ouch, clearly not looking forward to the changes. tbh, as a somewhat newer player it does seem to create the opportunity for more emergent behaviour than the current system. Or it could just be a nightmare, no way to tell yet. üòõ

Yeah I don't think I totally agree with rog's assessment. If there are 3 seats and the other two are happy with the governor, they can simply not vote and let the governor do their thing as before. THen they simply act as backups in the governor goes inactive

[25-Jun-24 09:00 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm quite looking forward to the changes, despite a bit of sadness at only getting two weeks of dividend payouts. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out, both in terms of politics running planets and the changes in how folks may source upkeep materials.


[25-Jun-24 09:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I was pondering if we should formalize some other programs to help new OOG members, not really sure what that would be. Maybe just stronger encouragement to take loans?


[25-Jun-24 09:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
OOG Grant program? üòÑ


[25-Jun-24 09:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, but I guess like a recurring one? Perhaps?


[25-Jun-24 09:21 AM] katinga#0000
Grants would be a good idea.  Loans sometimes have a negative stigma


[25-Jun-24 09:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Loans are pretty sustainable, and it seems like they'd help out just as much as grants with starting players. Cause once you get a new base up and running, it's just making good money from there on out. And then you've got a revolving door forever with loans. But I agree there are some people who will just never be interested in a loan. And you also don't want to trap someone in payments in a way that prevents t hem from doing fun things with their income.


[25-Jun-24 09:24 AM] katinga#0000
yes


[25-Jun-24 09:25 AM] katinga#0000
Grants can be specific.  New base.  or a grant for a new ship or ship upgrade.  No worries about paying it back either


[25-Jun-24 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
Now that dividends are done I would love to "unlock" all the capital in our inactive players. Maybe I will set up a ping


[25-Jun-24 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
But as for the details of a OOG grant program... would it be on-request? Or like a regular scheduled thing?


[25-Jun-24 09:27 AM] katinga#0000
In the real world, you have to apply for a grant.


[25-Jun-24 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
On-request maybe for a business plan?


[25-Jun-24 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I sort of assume allocater already has a billion dollars and will hand it out on request

[25-Jun-24 09:31 AM] katinga#0000
A regular thing would be more like a stipend.  we already get dividends


[25-Jun-24 10:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
Those are gone starting Wed though


[25-Jun-24 10:20 AM] katinga#0000
So is this discussion because OOG wants to offer something in lieu of that?


[25-Jun-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's the idea, perhaps


[25-Jun-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Probably not serving the exact same purpose. But our long-time welcome money tradition hasn't really grown with inflation or kept up with the changing meta around loans and other grant programs


[25-Jun-24 10:29 AM] katinga#0000
Other co-op projects might be a good idea.  Stone Soup projects for finished products.  Ex: OOG would like more SF supply.  pool folks to harvest the ingredients and then others to do refining.  this is a simple example, but you get the idea.  consumables in general are in high demand.  if OOG winds up selling surplus, then those involved in the project get shared profits?


[25-Jun-24 11:18 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, just having access to corp prices on goods helps a fair amount. There's a broader range of items available inside the corp than via ADI (as an example). 

I flip flop on loans for bases, as in some ways building up yourself (beyond some initial bootstrapping in the first 30-45 days) is at least some of the fun. That said, I think they may be good for chunkier investments, particularly 3rd ship which is a big jump in initial outlay for an relatively new player.


[25-Jun-24 12:06 PM] katinga#0000
for me upgrading the 2 starter ships was a huge improvement


[25-Jun-24 12:39 PM] katinga#0000
Plus the order system isn't 100% reliable.  Very often, I've had orders sit in that channel long enough that I wind up buying from the CX.  So co op projects where the production can more reliably supply its participants could be a viable option.  Surplus can still be sold to the corp or the CX


[25-Jun-24 12:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
some prices and orders in #orders just don't work for me. Lots of the prices are based on values from over a year ago, and sometimes I buy middle products on the CX which increases my lower end. I also really don't like having to make contracts for really small values and just ignore orders for like 20k worth of something


[25-Jun-24 12:57 PM] hernanduer#0000

I'll be able to provide items to you smaller guys outside of my irregular auctions


[25-Jun-24 01:03 PM] katinga#0000
I get that.  there isn't a consistent price model or menu taking into account the rising price of producing those goods.  wouldn't the co-ops help offset that?


[25-Jun-24 01:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
If we could have counterbids, similar to the projects, it might be more fruitful


[25-Jun-24 01:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
also asking the people who make the order to do the contract would make me much happier

They need a pro account to make CONTs yes?


[25-Jun-24 01:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
to interact at all with CONTs requires at least basic, only 2 people in corp are basic I think


[25-Jun-24 01:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
free can't use CONTs between players


[25-Jun-24 01:11 PM] katinga#0000
Personally, I find the cont UI to be frustrating.  I select an item I want to sell or buy, and it reverts back to RATs all the time on me.  Devs could address the cont system overall.  including more than one item.  Purchase Orders!


[25-Jun-24 01:13 PM] mrsmith33#0000
the reason is because user needs to click in the dropdown list after typing, to select the item.


[25-Jun-24 01:13 PM] katinga#0000
it's still aggravating


[25-Jun-24 01:14 PM] mrsmith33#0000

I think it‚Äôs tough because we‚Äôre split into players to whom saving 20k on RATs makes a big difference, players for which 20k of RATs is a rounding error (and not worth the clicks), and people like me weirdly in the middle


[25-Jun-24 01:51 PM] akyantor#0000
Tbh, could just have a convention that the person who made the order sends the contract. Didn‚Äôt seem unreasonable


[25-Jun-24 01:51 PM] akyantor#0000
They are the person wanting the goods after all


[25-Jun-24 01:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
It helps a lot if people are able to batch orders together, and I‚Äôm more than happy to do buy now pay later contracts for people to help them stock up

Yea, we need `Fulfill all (the other guy makes contract)` button

To loop all the way back to Archiel's post. Is it worth making a list of people who want to volunteer to be reps on these planets? *Maybe could be a tab in our OOG sheet, just to co-ordinate coverage?*


[25-Jun-24 02:57 PM] akyantor#0000
Had a go [collating volunteers on the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit?gid=1107030098#gid=1107030098).

It occurs to me we need to co-ordinate votes as well as being running, if you don't get any votes you don't get elected. Or at least I thought that was the case?

The most votes becomes governor, the next [N] most votes become parliament. So yeah, I think there will be a lot of vote swapping. You can change your vote mid-election... So if Hern is obviously gonna win Nike, some of us can switch to our other members.

As the new release is out I've submitted myself for the elections on:
- WU-070a - To hopefully become the governor. *Would appreciate votes from any members with a presence here (will have my base up tomorrow morning).*
- ZV-759g - To secure the member seat alongside @uncle_leslie69's governorship.

The good news is the upkeep requirements for WU-070a appear straightforward. I'll have my own supply of OFF soon for popi, and the cogc upkeep is fairly low given the number of bases, so should be very managable.

It may be a good idea to only leave 1 candidate on Demeter right before the end of the voting, so that there is a parliament of 1. No need to wait for votes.

For example, if you are winning and want to be a parliament person but not a governor, you can quick withdraw, rejoin, then vote for yourself.

are the votes anonymous or can players see who you vote for?


[26-Jun-24 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
They are anonymous


[26-Jun-24 10:00 AM] draconisdomini#0000
They are anonymous


[26-Jun-24 10:00 AM] churavis#0000
It's good that they're anonymous, otherwise you would easily have vote-buying schemes


[26-Jun-24 10:04 AM] draconisdomini#0000
What is the logic behind the base establishment fee that has been added? I can't help thinking of the possibility of someone settling a new planet, becoming governor and then setting the fee so high no one else can move there


[26-Jun-24 10:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's one of the possible uses. But also it allows the government to collect tax money early in the process, before established bases are making tax income.


[26-Jun-24 10:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Since new bases need money right away for the immigration projects


[26-Jun-24 10:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
capped at 20k for faction planets, which is pretty small


[26-Jun-24 10:08 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Ah, ok.  Yeah, that is a pretty low cap


[26-Jun-24 10:18 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I wish there was an elections view that could list all of the elections currently ongoing on planets where you have bases

it is a poison.  but gee... water can kill you, too


[26-Jun-24 09:54 PM] katinga#0000
you'd have to drink a pretty hefty amount of grain alcohol to die from it


[26-Jun-24 09:55 PM] katinga#0000
the difference is whether the body can process it and expel the toxins.  metals can accumulate in tissues.  that's how lead poisoning over time kills you


[26-Jun-24 09:55 PM] churavis#0000
My question is whether having extra toxins would stop people from drinking it


[26-Jun-24 09:56 PM] katinga#0000
depends on how stupid they are.  4 years ago, you had people eating Tide pods and others thought that drinking bleach would cure them of COVID


[26-Jun-24 09:57 PM] churavis#0000
Right, so it's not implausible that a drink called 'transparent aluminum' would have actual aluminum dust in it

[26-Jun-24 09:57 PM] churavis#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:50 AM] churavis#0000
It's a public channel, Rise and his people aren't the only ones seeing the chat. There are plenty of other observers who won't know you from anything else.

I don't think it matters, most of the voting people are either in here or in AA where they can be brainwashed by him to whichever way

but seeing as I am likely older than him anyways, it just annoys me lol

Trust me, it does matter. I'm sure you are older than him so don't let him provoke you any more than you would some toddler looking for attention in all the wrong ways.

which makes me worry a little on the project I'm trying to promote in 382.  he's sitting on A, so far I'm running unopposed on C, but I don't know that anyone is there to vote.  C is on strike and needs a direction anyway.

I took a quick scan of Rise's discord and I think there's a decently strong consensus there that he's been out of line, even with the heated stuff that went on in those channels they are recognizing he took a very low road.

Think Archiel has to add it to the script he uses to populate that sheet


[28-Jun-24 08:44 AM] mrsmith33#0000

[28-Jun-24 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah my planet tracker script is still a disaster, I think I have to make it a little worse before I make it better


[28-Jun-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Not really. What I do is pull each planet, ( https://rest.fnar.net/planet/Malahat ) then find the `GovernorUserName` then I pull the https://rest.fnar.net/company/code/ARCL for them, look through the `Offices` array and find the latest timestamp `EndEpochMs` then convert that into a time that google docs can handle.. Then that's the end of the term, and the election starts 8 days before that


[28-Jun-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
the caveat is this sheet is broken now because governors aren't listed like that anymore. For new terms at least


[28-Jun-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
so this is pre-update data


[28-Jun-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
but the terms should stay on that timer for a bit


[28-Jun-24 10:47 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, any old terms just add 30 to the number as a stopgap


[28-Jun-24 10:47 AM] akyantor#0000
Ouch, I figured it had to be something a bit indirect, and I was right. üòõ


[28-Jun-24 10:48 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess conceivably the terms for continuously governed worlds will just roll over each time, so you'd only need to capture them once, and then could calculate the future schedule or elections.


[28-Jun-24 02:55 PM] hernanduer#0000

Just pulling an idea out of a planet thread. What do folks think about having a public page where we list governance reports for our planet, as [per the thread](https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1255506593131266098/1257369634869477416) in the #üíéhyalos . If folks think it's a good idea, I don't mind having a go at setting something up.


[01-Jul-24 04:18 PM] akyantor#0000
It might be a good way to positively promote our good governance of some of the planets under our managed.


[01-Jul-24 04:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been thinking of getting us a domain name, there's probably a handful of tools and odds and ends that would be convenient to have a host for. http://oog-capital-management.com ? etc? Any interest in that? Happy to put it on my shared host, but I'd probably want to rope someone into doing the front end so it looks nice

Erm, a few examples:

[01-Jul-24 04:33 PM] akyantor#0000
I don't think it should be mandatory.


[01-Jul-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
My philosophy is to do the bare minimum that clearly conveys the sheer amount of expensive stuff that gets dumped into Malahat each week

Are we talking wix, or some other front end builder? I might have a friend who can help, or I can try myself though in no designer üòÖ


[02-Jul-24 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have no idea! I'm not familiar with too many of the tools the kids are using these days. But if it can output pages I can drop into a host, it's all good. I've ended up with wordpress pages before and it's okjay, but I'm never in love with it, lots of update headaches and such.


[02-Jul-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
It seems like you can queue up and pre-pay for up to 30 days of workforce programs as governor. As long as you remember to come back and press "start program" on the motion that has passed and been paid for.

I guess it comes down to what we want to put on it... frankly if it's just a bunch of links out to governance reports it could be knocked out by hand pretty quickly.


[02-Jul-24 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Step 1: 
Fancy web 2.0  (3.0..??? 4.0???) landing page with a logo.


[02-Jul-24 03:26 PM] akyantor#0000
Shoot me now before we put it on Web3, or whatever that blockchain nonsense is üòõ


[02-Jul-24 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I would put up some static info with recruitment guidelines

[02-Jul-24 03:28 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, so probably worth doing a little more than hand crafted if we're going to have more than a landing page.


[02-Jul-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
The simplest version is to use a framework which can turn markdown pages into webpages using a template. Hugo etc.


[02-Jul-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
As that's less of a mare to maintain than something requiring a backing database/storage.


[02-Jul-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
And it just compiles into flat html content that you can host anywhere


[02-Jul-24 03:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, static links to various sheets. Some public recruiting and ship sales stuff. Those sorts of things I am probably more comfortale editing html than messing with a complicated editor like the wordpress one. If it just operated on styled markdown, that would be lovely too. I've used some "personal wiki" softwares, which are really lightweight, and we could hand out a couple logins if people wanted to do that.

I do have Hugo experience, moderately happy with that.

I will probably stop posting screenshots hosted on my personal page if I have a place to dump game content.


[02-Jul-24 03:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hugo might be good, we could put the source on github and let anyone post crap on it, then just publish to the page. I think many of us here would be comfortable with that.


[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] akyantor#0000
If you got the hugo route, then the hosting is free/easy, as you can just plug in cloudflare pages for free, and it'll automatically deploy changes for you.


[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] akyantor#0000
A simple workflow in github could allow more than one contributor, if that's desirable.


[02-Jul-24 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
For a while I ran a local copy of the FIO backend.  (when it was misbehaving and when I was helping work on it). It would be nice to have the option to do something like that somewhere "official".

[02-Jul-24 03:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
But anyone who wants to set something up, send me your public ssh key and I'll get you ssh access to my host. (or make a github repo)


[02-Jul-24 03:38 PM] akyantor#0000
I've tried Hugo, the other option is jekyll. I got as far as plugging in a custom theme for one of those.


[02-Jul-24 03:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
My coworker is pretty adamantly against Jekyll so I'm predisposed against it, but if someone has experience I'd defer to them


[02-Jul-24 03:38 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably have to refresh myself on either...


[02-Jul-24 03:39 PM] akyantor#0000
So probably try to get Hugo to work, if there are at least two of us who've used it before


[02-Jul-24 03:40 PM] akyantor#0000
I may have some time to have a go this weekend, perhaps. Not the best frontend design wise, so would happily let someone else have a go.

I'm ok with him being governor if he wants to be the one to actually bring the MATs and set up the motions. Maybe message him and come to an agreement

[08-Jul-24 09:22 AM] katinga#0000
You only use the motions to change things or run programs.  I suppose the latter would be more common on established planets?  on my 3, I learned to put all the changes I wanted to make on 1 motion.


[08-Jul-24 09:38 AM] archielvahr#0000

Deimos is a starter planet, and I'm not complaining about the cost. I always knew it was a charity. 
I just find this sorta stuff interesting, and I suspect peeps in planet chat will find it interesting too.

Takeaway there is.. Safety and Health were super cheap with what he was filling


[08-Jul-24 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
but out of $34k spending per day on culture, the PIOs eat $22k of it


[08-Jul-24 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000

Now that I'm on parliament on a couple of planets, I can't help but feel vindicated in my past opinion: "governorship is always a charity".
**Costs per week**
(incl COGC)
Deimos (starter planet) - Income: 530k; Expenses (CX price): 850k
Nike - Income: 380k; Expenses (CX price): 810k
Heph - Income: 370k; Expenses (CX price): 510k
Griffonstone - Income: 490k; Expenses (CX price): 730k
Elon - Income: 190k; Expenses (CX price): 290k

It's also my opinion: if you make a consumable at a lower cost than the CX price, that difference _IS_ the charity cost to you.


[13-Jul-24 03:55 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
And, if you source a consumable at a lower cost than the CX price, that difference _IS_ the charity cost, except that it's paid by the producer.

It does seem fairly consistant that planets have been operating at a loss.


[13-Jul-24 04:09 AM] akyantor#0000
Even a smaller planet with only PIO/SET needs like WU-070a is running at a loss 44k per week at AI Ask, but only bringing taxes worth 25k.


[13-Jul-24 04:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm coming around to the idea that it would be reasonable to calibrate the taxes to be cost-neutral at AI Ask, as it'd encourage more availability of goods via the CX.


[13-Jul-24 04:14 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I agree.


[13-Jul-24 04:14 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
To be fair, in the above examples, some bases (Nike, Grif) use the more expensive consumables because the governors are making/sourcing the consumables at a lower price. The above is just an example.


[13-Jul-24 04:14 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
(I also think a number of bases are "overheating" by over-supplying consumables, but that is a separate discussion)


[13-Jul-24 04:31 AM] akyantor#0000
I think my other observation is that not a lot of planets have increased taxes yet. It eels like there's a reluctance to be among the first, but perhaps that's just the planets I'm on.


[13-Jul-24 09:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
It's Filthy's stated goal that he wants them to be tax neutral, so if they're not now, and he's actually doing a good job, then they will be soon


[13-Jul-24 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
And the problem with CX ask with some of the weirder goods is that the goods are needed by so few people that their price deviates from reason


[13-Jul-24 09:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
So something like BID, I'm using my internal cost and then adding a premium to it


[13-Jul-24 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
Typing on my phone I always end up needing to edit every message because autocorrect decides the tenses are gonna mismatch lol


[13-Jul-24 09:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
BID are still more expensive than OLF though, I've adjusted my production chain to increase CHP to make them


[13-Jul-24 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Generally taxes are incredibly low, often 1% or a fraction of 1% on most goods. so doubling them to get the planets to neutral is totally acceptable.


[13-Jul-24 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I definitely share all of Paris's sentiments

[13-Jul-24 10:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Rise is running Phobos with fairly discounted prices. I guess those consumables are mostly coming from his sponsored bases. But he seems to have a very cost-conscious plan. It will probably be net 0 or profitable at his costs. 

I'm running malahat with prices sliiiiightly above CX on average. But it's a special case cause of all those EDC farmers... and also being outside ANT space changes things I feel


[13-Jul-24 02:52 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Those EDC farmers can afford to pay a premium.

In the spirit of the discussion above, I'm going to increase the taxes for the second week in a row on WU-070a to try to get it to a cost neutral position (using prices around AI CX market AVG). Will see if there's much push back. üôÇ


[14-Jul-24 10:15 AM] akyantor#0000
It's effectively a 25% rise in taxes across the board. PIO has gone from 12 to15, SET has gone from 30 to 35, which now looks a little higher than a lot of planets now, which I suspect are operating at a loss relative to market.

Lots of good ways to get started, you could hop into one of the ongoing elections for a planet you have a base on and that have a bigger parliament, probably a 3 person one

I don't know. Just looking at the upkeep goods contributed just for the SST. He's probably put in 350k in just OFF, if you assume an under market price of 100/u

[01-Aug-24 10:09 AM] akyantor#0000
For what it's worth I don't think it's worth arguing in public channels with Rise about him getting contacts to support him in elections. He has an informal network of supporters, and our shareholders have the same within our corp. *I think raising this just results in somewhat unproductive mud slinging.* I think it's probably more productive to focus on the merits of good efficient/transparent governance, and on support our shareholders have given to a planets operations.

[01-Aug-24 10:13 AM] akyantor#0000
There's a precious small number that bother to vote in elections at all... so doubt it'd work. It's even less obvious how you'd objectively measure how effectively a planet is managed given the tools available, even when you're an elected member. There's a bunch of information (like how many jobs have been run using what workers) that simply isn't available to calculate some kind of "efficiency". You have to rely on a bunch of indirect measures.

Haha ill join you when im able to start expanding again. But iv hit HQ20 so it'll be a while


[01-Aug-24 10:53 AM] akyantor#0000
I think it's a pretty fun project to try to colonise further out anyway.


[01-Aug-24 10:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I don't have the mental energy for these super antagonistic elections. It's not really my personality. Especially if other people think they want to run them at a loss. I would like to get my 7m out of malahat though before someone else takes the planet, as a matter of principle üòï

I feel like the gates will make that easier as well

moving out i mean


[01-Aug-24 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep hopefully!


[01-Aug-24 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
I wonder if it's worth specutively grabbing all the top HEX tap planets ü§î


[01-Aug-24 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
There's no infrastructure on any of the top hex planets.


[01-Aug-24 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am guessing but it definitely feels like the jump fuel will use HEX, riiiight?


[01-Aug-24 11:06 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If you are planning on it, I‚Äôd wait for the dev to announce it. 
If I were a dev, I‚Äôd definitely change plans if I say someone was trying to monopolies the new shiny product


[01-Aug-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think the devs would notice


[01-Aug-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
And by the time they announce it, it'll be too late


[01-Aug-24 11:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
Muahhhaha


[01-Aug-24 11:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
Is how I imagine you laughed saying that Archiel


[01-Aug-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's true! üòÑ


[01-Aug-24 11:16 AM] marat_sh#0000
Could they introduce a new element for new mechanics?


[01-Aug-24 11:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think they'll add a new extractable resource. People have been griping about the unused mats for years


[01-Aug-24 11:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
Looking at NA üëÄ


[01-Aug-24 11:18 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ah yes, NA. I can barely give it away


[01-Aug-24 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
Occasionally someone in ADI will start up a GF or NAB and I can give away a few thousand


[01-Aug-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
`And on top of that there will be an all-new type of fuel that a gateway owner will have to provide ` I take that to mean a new fuel recipe, with a new mat.. I'm assuming it will be using existing mats. or they'd mention it if it was just made


[01-Aug-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
It'll probably be made in a REF so we should be prepared for that...


[01-Aug-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
So in terms of utterly unused mats, we have MTC and JUI.. HEX being a precursor for JUI


[01-Aug-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
It would seem like a miss to not use JUI/HEX you'd think, but then not obvious that it makes sense for it to be a component for fuel.


[01-Aug-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Based upon the description of the good


[01-Aug-24 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then there's CRU and TAC which are also practically unused. THey might end up in the gateway itself.


[01-Aug-24 11:23 AM] marat_sh#0000
how long this game has been out? I can believe you guys managed to expand without any transportation infrastructure


[01-Aug-24 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
This universe is 1255 days old


[01-Aug-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I've been around 828 days


[01-Aug-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
and yeah the universe was very different back then, heh


[01-Aug-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the entire corp had 3 non-starter  ships when I joined


[01-Aug-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
They were essentially corp-owned and shared


[01-Aug-24 11:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
That‚Äôs crazy


[01-Aug-24 11:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
Also having one selling point (CX) is also very questionable decision‚Ä¶ People can‚Äôt sell product to their neighbors on the same planet without subscription


[01-Aug-24 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, the evolution of the universe itself is an interesting study


[01-Aug-24 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
because a the very beginning all you have is what market makers provide


[01-Aug-24 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
SETs and TECs run at abysmal efficiencies


[01-Aug-24 11:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
ENG and SCI can't even exist for months


[01-Aug-24 11:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
I wasn't here for all of that, but some people were


[01-Aug-24 11:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
Very exciting to be honest.. being the first there


[01-Aug-24 11:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, pretty much everyone who leaves says "ping me when they reset"


[01-Aug-24 11:29 AM] marat_sh#0000
But taking goods off the planet to sell someone who brings that good back to that planet is stupid üòÖ


[01-Aug-24 11:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, local markets make a lot of sense then


[01-Aug-24 11:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
it‚Äôs definitely a compromise between having an interesting and engaging CX vs being able to trade everything anywhere


[01-Aug-24 11:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
The percent of players who subscribe is something like 50%, they've shared that before. It's a niche game so most people end up paying.


[01-Aug-24 11:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
I know making CXes s on a lot of peoples lists, but I'm not super enthused about it because i think it'll thin out markets that are already pretty thin

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[01-Aug-24 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
it doesn't help that there are whole shadow markets


[01-Aug-24 11:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
and continue to complicated pricing, (but that's just cause i'm lazy when it comes to pricing my stuff)


[01-Aug-24 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
even we're guilty of that, but not to a huge extent


[01-Aug-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
There are a ton of shadow markets, most goods probably move that way. But they are held in check by the fact that it's easier to throw stuff on the CX than manage contracts


[01-Aug-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
And things don't sit in a shadow market quite the same way they can sit on a CX


[01-Aug-24 11:32 AM] marat_sh#0000
Just removing requirements for local markets and changing UI for it would help a lot for new players and people who don‚Äôt want to pay


[01-Aug-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
so private CXes are gonna get a lot of abandoned goods floating on them forever


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, it kind of segregates gameplay further, the more I've been thinking about  them recently the more I'm against them


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
and I liked them earlier


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
Someone post and ad of selling C but it‚Äôs 1000, what if I want just 100 out of it


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
DM the guy and ask


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's an MMO afterall üòÑ


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
I wish we had an in-corp way to retreive idle assets / idle capital better. Not as a game feature, but as a corp one


[01-Aug-24 11:34 AM] marat_sh#0000
Better UI will make it more efficient I think, making it like order from CX


[01-Aug-24 11:35 AM] marat_sh#0000
All of it will fix itself hopefully with gates


[01-Aug-24 11:39 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I would say there could be several CX scattered around but that have to be built up. That way if a region gets colonized, one of the effort would be getting the CX setup


[01-Aug-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Like the cash Churaviis put into APEX could have funded ADI's grants for a year, or built the infrastructure (ADM/COGC/all of em) for a few dozen planets


[01-Aug-24 11:40 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The dev that way keep control of the placement and number


[01-Aug-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
So arclight was built after launch in order to be a new "outer rim" region


[01-Aug-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
It ended up being kind of a turd though üòÜ


[01-Aug-24 11:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Like there's a few people who dedicate themselves to pumping up the minor CXes where no one lives. But it's a passion project that sort of seems to have no point. Occasionally some trader comes in and cleans out the minor CX and resells everythign on a main CX, then somone is a little sad


[01-Aug-24 11:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, it was an attempt at promoting outward colonization, but without actually fixing any of the issues that come with that


[01-Aug-24 11:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
Of which there are three:
1) Distance is slow to cover, and more ships are needed to move things around. This wouldn't matter so much if not for 2.
2) The planets farther out are far less quality than the faction space planets. More special items required, generally less medium-high quality sources. To get any significant industries, you're travelling between a lot more systems and spending a lot more on base parts. Earlier in the universe, these base parts were far more expensive, but have become a lot more available over time.
3) There are very few fertile planets in the outer rim, meaning no matter what, you'll have to have faction space planets to support your high tier populations.


[01-Aug-24 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
So they tried to fix 1) and 3) on 2 separate occasions - they improved fertility around Saladin in the far north at one point


[01-Aug-24 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
and they added the CXs to reduce distance to cover


[01-Aug-24 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
but as I mentioned, the real problem about distances is two-fold - the CX is only the lesser part, the greater issue is the increased scarcity of medium quality planets


[01-Aug-24 11:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
those are my thoughts at least


[01-Aug-24 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
jumpgates are a more generalized solution to problem 1, and depending on their cost and distance covered could end up helping with problem 2 and 3 as well


[01-Aug-24 11:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
Transportation would fix a lot of issues. Having more throughput will fix market prices and availability as well as removing the effects of shadow market


[01-Aug-24 11:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
Not so much impact on shadow markets, I think


[01-Aug-24 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
Rise is basically running 80% of Antares on his shadow market, and then complains that the CX doesn't reflect real prices


[01-Aug-24 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
If they never migrate to the CX, real prices will never be reflected there. Is it open to manipulation? Yeah, but that's part of the game


[01-Aug-24 11:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
and manipulations rarely last longer than a month


[01-Aug-24 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
but it could bring places that are far apart WAY closer together. We don't know enough about the implementation details or costs


[01-Aug-24 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
If a jump costs 50k in fuel, that's a big deal


[01-Aug-24 11:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
if it's 10k, that's less than the FF you'd probably spend, so I'm leaning more towards the 50k


[01-Aug-24 11:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
is it instantaneous or reduced travel time? Is there ship wear? lots of questions


[01-Aug-24 11:59 AM] marat_sh#0000
Let‚Äôs move this discussion to general


[01-Aug-24 12:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
üòÑ


[01-Aug-24 12:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
as far as politically, I think any planet we establish in the outer reaches should have a 10mil tag strictly to prevent Rise from ever appearing

[01-Aug-24 12:01 PM] hernanduer#0000

[01-Aug-24 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Eh I'd just roll with it. I think it's intended as good natured advice, just a little strange. I know the name, he should have more context

I'm trying to find a way to say "Thanks for the writeup" that doesn't sound sarcastic and I'm not sure I can, so maybe saying nothing is good..???


[01-Aug-24 02:11 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, that's what I'd do... it would mostly appear to be well intentioned advice. Assume positive intent, and move on. üôÇ


[01-Aug-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also I'd like to point out that Rise (and presumably others) can read the OOG discord. I don't think there's realistically anything we can do about that other than accept it and be mindful of it when posting in OOG channels


[01-Aug-24 02:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

Like the lowering the tax rate to 500 for SCI thing he‚Äôs acting like that happened like yesterday


[02-Aug-24 11:55 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't think it's reasonble to compare the margin between the tax income and the costs for upkeep before and after the release. It wasn't possible pre-release to know how much income came from a single planet. After the patch everything has been done in a more than fair / transparent manner.


[02-Aug-24 11:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. He‚Äôs pissed about when we originally took over Malahat and also about his tax cuts being shot down on Phobos


[02-Aug-24 11:56 AM] akyantor#0000
If there were a big surplus to be accured over time it's not like it'd be possible to withdraw it without it being visible.


[02-Aug-24 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, because he‚Äôs not having a good faith discussion :/


[02-Aug-24 11:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Does he really think that there will just be a big heist of the surplus later, and then what?


[02-Aug-24 11:57 AM] akyantor#0000

It's confusing to me... as the only saving he's concretely said is to be made is to save 2m of supposed underspend against taxes.

It would seem perfectly reasonable to maintain a bit of a warchest on a planet that has expensive needs when upgrades are required.


[02-Aug-24 11:59 AM] akyantor#0000
That requires running a bit of a surplus.

[02-Aug-24 12:03 PM] akyantor#0000
I think more importantly the population on Jeetiyu isn't meaningfully growing... whereas it's grown considerably on Malahat (3-4k additional SCI in a couple of months). I'd assume that has required an investment in both programs and infrastructure upgrades that's not inconsiderable.


[02-Aug-24 12:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs absolutely not. The planet is 7m in debt to Archiel according to the ledger


[02-Aug-24 12:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I think he should say it more cause the guy is saying he is tens of millions in the green lol


[02-Aug-24 12:08 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd have some sympathy if there were more concrete suggestions on how to economise on those upgrades or use of pop upkeep goods, but there's been nothing on that point so far. Just a suggestion to remove the 2m buffer.


[02-Aug-24 12:09 PM] akyantor#0000
It'd be far more constructive if those types of suggestions had been made.


[02-Aug-24 12:11 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah well. You can't control what others do, just try not to get dragged into pointless arguments.


[02-Aug-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah so the current argument is sort of "there were taxes before the update that aren't in the post-update government coffers"


[02-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which is true, but that's how the game works, so what am I supposed to do about it?


[02-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think he wants to go back and collect all the OOG dividends and put them back into the government


[02-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is totally impractical


[02-Aug-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to engage with that though, because if he decides that's what he wants, it can't happen


[02-Aug-24 12:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
Probably best to just ignore it then


[02-Aug-24 12:46 PM] archielvahr#0000

[02-Aug-24 12:46 PM] hernanduer#0000

[02-Aug-24 12:48 PM] akyantor#0000
It's not actually possible to calculate the portion of the dividend associated with Malahat, or the cost that you bore to supply the upkeep goods, so it's an impossible ask.


[02-Aug-24 12:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think the arguement is easy - were the POPI being fed before the update?


[02-Aug-24 12:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
If yes - then what does it matter?


[02-Aug-24 12:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
It's the same thing people try to bring up with how we were splitting dividends among a lot of people. As if it was "their" tax money and it could only be used in "their" ways, but that's not how the game worked before. It was an agreement: we fund all the infrastructure, you give us taxes. What we do with the tax money shouldn't matter to you, and OOG chose to split it among all members


[02-Aug-24 12:51 PM] akyantor#0000
I think the other side of that argument is that they may have been overpaying for the fair value of the upkeep, which is possible. But frankly, it's water under the bridge, old system is gone, and everything has been scrupulously transparent since it was possible to do so.


[02-Aug-24 12:52 PM] akyantor#0000
The vote is on the governance for the next period based upon how you reasonable expect the candidate to behave within the constraints of the system now. Not what they were more than a month ago with completely different goverance structures.


[02-Aug-24 12:54 PM] akyantor#0000
It feels like an excuse just to re-litigate old complaints about OOG. Which is why I agree with Archiel (and what you said), best not to engage on an argument about that particular point, it's old news.


[02-Aug-24 12:56 PM] archielvahr#0000

So Phobos right now is collecting about 12m a month, and spending about 2.5m on upkeep. So there is an ongoing discussion behind the scenes on what the excess money will be for. There might be a small tax decrease, but my opinion is that there's opportunities to do some fun stuff with it. I'm tentatively leaning towards gateways- pending their final mechanics and costs. Rise  seems open to that, and also is considering having Phobos subsidize other planets, esp the very small ones. I think that's a pretty good idea also, that's essentially what OOG has done our entire existance, so it would be nice to have somethinfg formal in place for that.

I'm not as much a fan of subsidizing smaller planets, since those on smaller planets tend to be more established players anyways. They can deal with the brunt of the costs, while Phobos is really just a starter planet

The three planets on Nyx don't really make any income, but they only take 10k or so to fill the cogc and POPI. Population hasn't been growing much there so maybe it'll ramp up if more people from the corp show up.

More seriously, it helps to disincentivize IDC production in favor of other production. And slowing IDC production slows the total growth of cash. Once we have the cash, I'm inclined to inject it back into the ANT economy to keep the velocity of the cash up. I think injecting the cash into the non-IDC parts of the market do more good than destroying ( locking up) the cash does with respect to inflation.

it's a double-edged sword because if we make printing on Mahalat _too_ expensive, people will just start another planet. or ten if you're firefreak


[16-Dec-24 01:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
i think things are okay as-is, we just need to find _something_ to do with the money


[16-Dec-24 01:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
and I think anything that's not spending directly on malahat will awaken the tax hawks again


[16-Dec-24 01:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr maybe we could sink some of that into more UNI for the passive education bonuses?


[16-Dec-24 01:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
planet gov should have it's own inv


[16-Dec-24 01:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
putting BIDs on behalf of planet administration


[16-Dec-24 01:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
that would make reimbursement so nice


[16-Dec-24 01:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
also budget transfer between planet administrations


[16-Dec-24 01:21 PM] roche3950#0000
plenty of other options that don‚Äôt just drive supply chains for SCI and SCI consumables


[16-Dec-24 01:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean not really‚Ä¶ there are options, but not great ones


[16-Dec-24 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But bc there are SCI consumables being made and sold it makes it possible to have SCI for other production chains easier


[16-Dec-24 01:38 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Maybe the balance is our check against the MM's inevitable decline? As IDC is made to be less profitable, all these printing press bases will be rendered obsolete. Maybe then the taxes are lifted, and the balance is brought back in to alleviate rebuilding production chains and promote use of the planet? Just a random thought after reading half that conversation.


[16-Dec-24 01:43 PM] roche3950#0000
Not a bad idea


[16-Dec-24 01:44 PM] roche3950#0000
Malahat reserve being a hedge against IDC nerf fallout


[16-Dec-24 01:44 PM] katinga#0000
MM?  Plain or with peanuts?


[16-Dec-24 01:44 PM] roche3950#0000
Peanuts is all they have after the IDC sellers bring their volume to bear


[16-Dec-24 01:45 PM] katinga#0000
true... bears like peanuts


[16-Dec-24 01:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's not bad. Right now upkeep is around 2m a week. So it's a very very large buffer

I had heard from Rise a while ago that he would be winding down next summer. It sounds like he told @draconisdomini  that he is stepping back from some planets sooner than that.


[05-Jan-25 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
We might want to think about what we'd be interested in taking over, and seeing about making that a smooth transition


[05-Jan-25 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
With the gateway stuff going on, I don't really want more planets (In fact I want less!)


[05-Jan-25 01:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
winding down as in quitting the game? or just stepping back from planets?


[05-Jan-25 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Stepping back from governing and maybe reducing production, like going down to just a handful of planets


[06-Jan-25 12:24 PM] hernanduer#0000

[28-Jan-25 04:13 PM] akyantor#0000
A few of those are potentially good starter planets to look after for folks looking to get into being a governer rather than an MP


[28-Jan-25 04:15 PM] akyantor#0000
Anything that mostly just needs PIO/SET are pretty simple to look after


[28-Jan-25 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

* Astraeus
* Romulan a (he's MP, but I think he's putting everything in)

## üå† üå†  Space Politics Update! üå† üå† 

and ping everyone @here for it.

It's been a while since regular Space Politics newsletters, but we have a special edition today. Rise is winding down in the game and there's ~19 that will need new governors. If you're new or looking to get further into the game, this is a great opportunity.  And we have great guides and tools to help out!

Planets with PIOs and SETs only are pretty easy to run and a great way to get started. 

If you've been semi-afk or not paying attention, we've had some exciting QOL stuff come today, plus larger ship sizes (5k/5k).  So it's a great time to return


[28-Jan-25 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Take a look at the planet list above and consider being governor on some of them!

If you want another construction base to move to. May I suggest looking at the IA system. I've got PP4's on IA-151a and IA-158a.   So the planet's are already set up to support all your construction needs.

Cross-posting from outer-rim.  Rise has stepped down from governor on Life (or at least I won the election and haven't heard anything from him).  That now means I have three governor positions: Nascent, Life, and KI-401d.  If anyone would like to take on Life or KI-401d let me know.  They are both reasonably small and so pretty easy.

Do taxes now cover your expenses?


[11-Feb-25 01:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah people like to complain sometimes. I think you handled it really well. When people say things like "I'm just making an observation", or "I'm just asking questions", it usually means they are trying to stir things up. It's one of those rhetorical devices like "Lots of people are saying...." etc. So yeah, opening it to their suggestions is great


[11-Feb-25 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
40 and 80 for PIO and SET is gonna look objectively high. It's probably not out of line to cover expenses. Like no one can get rich OR poor on a plent with 3000 pop. I usually don't track expenses because you'll spend 5 minutes worrying over 3k AIC... it's like worrying that someone is selling you ship parts for 1 AIC each and you gotta get your 1 AIC back.


[11-Feb-25 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can hit em with the math for common products, if you feel like doing it.


[11-Feb-25 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
random off the cuff math... 50 AIC per 1d of REF. At 100% eff that's 680 SF or FF for 50 AIC. That's $11560 per day per ref. which is a tax rate of  0.432%.


[11-Feb-25 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
You should double check that


[11-Feb-25 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also enjoy offering to send them money for their taxes out of my own pocket


[11-Feb-25 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
enjoy your fat 350 AIC contract


[11-Feb-25 01:26 PM] bookliko#0000
no, at bare minimum expenses were 1000 and income 1000. so no room for any investment. The tax increase will allow for 2000 income


[11-Feb-25 01:26 PM] bookliko#0000

Thank you all for the feedback, I am pretty confident in my financial analysis. The irony that I see is that he was happy to pour in his own money before, but when I essentially make all participants pay via taxes, its too much... I guess its only cool when someone else invests.


[11-Feb-25 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. Some people just like to talk  (aka complain) too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Caskman invested 1.2M in ADM and SS. I think it would be very cool if Phobos could cover that.


[11-Feb-25 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will hit him up. He will probably refuse, I think he upgrades things randomly on many planets just for fun. I think he was the one who did Malahat's INF to 10


[11-Feb-25 01:42 PM] zipatsu#0000
I don't even remember taxes exist half the time, things would have to be going real bad somewhere for it to make a noticeable difference in the base operation üòï

Will say on this though that if it wasn't requested by you / the people then I wouldn't worry too much about paying it back, or at least don't assume that they paid full market price for the materials to do so ‚úåÔ∏è

Fair enough, it was indeed a voluntary injection. Of course you are correct on the actual price: my own cost price to do the same would be 255.000. (some people are very adamant about the value of opportunity cost...)


[11-Feb-25 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am adamant that if someone is getting reimbursed it should be at market rate üòâ

Opportunity cost is definitely a thing to keep in mind, it's also 100% fair to reimburse at market rate but personally I'd only consider doing so if it was discussed with the Governor / planet chat beforehand. Feels like it would be a needless source of strife if anyone can just come in with a bunch of upgrades that the unaware populace suddenly has to pay for (not that the increase would likely result to much of anything realistically but I've seen people go on rants over taxes in the past üòÑ )

The argument that small planets survive on donations isn‚Äôt wrong but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Make mandatory payments (high taxes) so planet can pay for itself instead of useless virtue signaling ( I helped build this planet or I payed for GOGC)


[11-Feb-25 02:41 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, don't really get the rationale. May need donations to build popi buildings, but upkeep can certainly be supported via taxes.


[11-Feb-25 02:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
I might never get into politics just because how treasury works üòÖ until they rework it and give government inventories and money transfers between planet treasuries

Just as a heads up for gov's in general, I think it's important to understand that pop drops are a big deal and need to be addressed asap. It's hard to avoid it when a planet is rapidly growing, but for established planets where the pop drop is caused by low upkeep, it's kind of a big deal.

Example - My base on Griffonstone - AML's - Dropped 31 Engineers. Which drops the profit of the base by around 25k per day, 175k per week. I suspect there's at least one or two other people experiencing similar losses going by the number of workers missing.

I'm missing 31 engineers on Grif


[12-Feb-25 05:24 AM] akyantor#0000
For what it's worth... I'd prioritise minimising open roles over higher taxes 90% of the time.


[12-Feb-25 05:36 AM] evov#0000
I wonder how high the engineers taxes would have to be to cost me an extra 175k per week?

I understand it's natural to try to optimize things and get as close to the edge as possible. I'm just pointing out (for anyone who might not know) the actual impact and relative cost of going over the edge.

For reference - this is the current pop report for Grif... and with respect to engineer pop - it's not just optimizing close to the edge, it's going past the edge, yeeting them off a cliff and hoping they just happen to have parachutes on for the fall.

If it's the result of a simple mistake - cool no worries. But if it's the result of intentional action... then the gov being better informed now, is preferable to them getting better informed later üôÇ

it's like optimizing an airplane. If you succeed, you saved a few dollars. If you fail, the plane crashes üòÑ

Anyone on Vulcan that wishes to vote me in instead of a non-oog person? We can try to manage the planet at that point with 2 of us being mps.

xepiov is governor on Aceland, and he didn't supply neither POPI nor COGC. It is 3 days before POPI runs out, and 2 days for COGC. Let's see if he will supply it


[17-Feb-25 02:38 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I've found the last prun player who waited for them to feed the POPI / COGC... wait I've a picture here somewhere.

Is it fine if I run for parliment on a bunch of planets? im already in for ISA and Harmonia, but would like to expand to Phobos, Norwick and Halcyon


[05-Mar-25 06:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
You‚Äôre definitely welcome on Halcyon - it‚Äôd be nice to have a full OOG parliament and kick xepiov out üòÑ

Xepiov is gone and it is caskman now I think

If you are going for governor, watch out to not overstretch in relation to headspace/real life time, to manage your empire and the planets. For MP you are going to be fine

Do we need another OOG face on Malahat? Just saw it was @archielvahr and @sidepipe running at the moment.

I'd be happy to pick up another support role if it doesn't ruffle any feathers.


[24-Mar-25 02:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can try


[24-Mar-25 02:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The last time it was 3 OOG (me Archi and Side) we ruffled some feathers I guess


[24-Mar-25 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I'm indifferent. It does look nice to see some non OOG people in the list


[24-Mar-25 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
They basically always just ignore it anyway


[24-Mar-25 02:50 PM] superbadsounds#0000

If it's helpful I can run there, though I don't plan on doing anything or taking any responsibility.
