@Deleted User, can I put this here?
I will be willing to loan b-fabs on ANT to the startups, no interest or set payback, to go along with whatever is said in #server-information

You are free to put whatever you want in here (minus #agp-information, I'd like to keep that for an embed with information).


[13-Jan-24 11:50 AM] jvaler#0000
@Deleted User i see there's a section for my contributions https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183252341776982137/1194268880273686630. when can i start sending money in? i can do 750k rn which should cover 3 people right?


[13-Jan-24 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you want to send conts to the three people on that list for the money that'd be great, I'll tick them off as complete.


[13-Jan-24 11:52 AM] jvaler#0000
the 3 250k ones?


[13-Jan-24 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[13-Jan-24 11:52 AM] jvaler#0000

[13-Jan-24 12:03 PM] jvaler#0000
sorry, read the CONT description. should explain everything.

all you have to do is accept and request termination


[13-Jan-24 12:04 PM] jvaler#0000
i see why people just buy 1 SF instead of this hassle


[13-Jan-24 12:05 PM] jvaler#0000

[13-Jan-24 12:06 PM] havanista#0000

[13-Jan-24 06:37 PM] jvaler#0000
@Deleted User is discord being fucky or did RedOut leave the server?


[13-Jan-24 06:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
It'd seem so.


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll ask about it but if he wanted the money and to leave after, it is what it is.


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I suspect it won't be the last that happens.


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] jvaler#0000
don't think it's that as the CONT is still open


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Huh.


[13-Jan-24 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I've asked, so we'll see if we get a response.

Fair enough.


[19-Jan-24 04:10 PM] jvaler#0000
@Deleted User @Deleted User i wanna get to these newer players that have been waiting in queue for a while. do you two have the 250k each for the 750k ready? i can donate 250k to 3 on the queue right now, but i don't want the 750k to get confusing


[19-Jan-24 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
@souless8175 @okamicheems1 sending conts for both of your 250k right now, we'll work towards getting your 500k at a later date as we go through the backlog.


[19-Jan-24 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can do 500k for him so you can do 250k to get it finished.


[19-Jan-24 04:15 PM] jvaler#0000
aw what i wanted to do that
jk i'm sure there'll be more


[19-Jan-24 04:16 PM] jvaler#0000

[19-Jan-24 04:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hm, limitation with the sheet, doesn't account for split payments.


[19-Jan-24 04:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wonder if I can work that in.


[19-Jan-24 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Both sent.


[19-Jan-24 04:17 PM] jvaler#0000
250k cont sent to polarbearz


[19-Jan-24 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Term conts after I send them please.


[19-Jan-24 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
@polarbearz7616 You have 750k waiting in your conts from me and Jvaler.


[19-Jan-24 04:20 PM] jvaler#0000
wait wdym 500k? is that +500k for 750k total? shouldn't it say 750k instead of 250k on the sheet then?


[19-Jan-24 04:21 PM] jvaler#0000
or if it's just 250k+250k=500k i can fill that in now


[19-Jan-24 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm doing 250k first and then doing 500k to reach 750k to split the payments to make it a bit easier on myself.


[19-Jan-24 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Since we have a lot of people to catch up on in terms of getting them to 750k total.


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] jvaler#0000
ohhhh so *all* the 250k people are meant to get 750k total?


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Eventually.


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] jvaler#0000
that makes more sense


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want 250k to be the minimum.


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
And 750k if we can afford it.


[19-Jan-24 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
We'll start working through the backlog as money comes in.


[19-Jan-24 04:23 PM] jvaler#0000
i think u got the A and J reversed. i sent 250k u sent 500k


[19-Jan-24 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sorry.


[19-Jan-24 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Long day at work.


[19-Jan-24 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Until I find the motivation to work out a better way to do split payments we'll just do it like that for now.


[19-Jan-24 04:26 PM] jvaler#0000
mind if i try making a sheet?


[19-Jan-24 04:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do quite like mine but sure.


[19-Jan-24 04:27 PM] jvaler#0000
could just steal elements and then decorate it how you like. idk


[19-Jan-24 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
That works.


[19-Jan-24 05:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you can remove me from the list btw. my plans have changed a bit, delayed while I figure out governor stuff. Hopefully I'll be able to help pay out some of these  instead


[19-Jan-24 08:17 PM] jvaler#0000
i've got something 85% functional made now. need to figure out what i wanna do with the donation tally because the column sizing messes it up. could probably make the names list vertically which would work as long as not too many people join in on donating.

i figured a goal-based system rather than a rigid queue would be more versatile. that way you can keep track of how much someone has received out of the desired total. it's missing a way to prioritize who should get money next, but that shouldn't be too hard to add if you'd like.

wanna know if you like this idea first before i do more work on it though. or if you'd prefer the queue-based system instead.

okay sweet. will continue


[19-Jan-24 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
okay there's a priority dropdown now. it's pretty rigid though and kinda underwhelming, but i don't have any better ideas.
sorting the list by last progress is always an option, that's kinda why it's there.

also tried to copy the style of your sheet. the yellow isn't the same though, instead it's antares orange.

[19-Jan-24 09:45 PM] jvaler#0000
here's the link. comments are on, but i don't know your email to give you edit perms. you can always just duplicate the sheet yourself though https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHlwiZ3z110rOlRlZ97K7ezpli1TeYM_4kOwbNLhDkc/edit?usp=sharing


[19-Jan-24 09:46 PM] jvaler#0000
there's also an issue where the little note icon that tells you to hover over a cell to read a note is invisible on the black background. but that's your style call


[19-Jan-24 09:48 PM] jvaler#0000
or like i said you can just pick and choose what elements to take or leave. sorry if my functions are messy or suboptimal


[19-Jan-24 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I could use this to help me work on the sheet we have, since although I do like yours I'm also trying to improve at spreadsheets myself so would like to continue with mine.


[19-Jan-24 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although it is really useful to see how you've done yours so I have something to go with.


[19-Jan-24 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe we'll swap to yours in the meantime though, not sure, will have to think about it.


[19-Jan-24 09:51 PM] jvaler#0000
the note for the function of the fufilled checkbox is hidden by the background, but this is what it says.
basically a contingency for if the person bails like RedOut it doesn't confuse the numbers

[19-Jan-24 09:52 PM] jvaler#0000
which is also why i used =SUMIFS on the fufilled column of goals, to check if the checkbox is true

~~the cells with formulas are marked with warnings in case someone misclicks and tries to edit them~~
that got really annoying when tinkering

How does throwing money at people work again?


[20-Jan-24 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do I just get the people on the list to send me a contract?


[20-Jan-24 05:45 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd assume so. since i heard your pro ran out?


[20-Jan-24 05:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah


[20-Jan-24 05:49 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd probably start with the people with 0 recieved, then get to those with 250k recieved but waiting the longest for the full 750k

[20-Jan-24 06:06 PM] jvaler#0000
australis' spreadsheet will be better because they're the project leader. i've been replicating what's on there in mine but unless australis adopts it their's will always be more up to date

@Deleted User money's a little tight as i'm getting buffers for my new heph base. can return to donating once heph POPR hits and i can start selling these REP and PT for good money. once things are stable i'm going to put some REP and PT on the internal market here too


[22-Jan-24 03:15 PM] Deleted User#0000

I have a carbon in MOR waiting to end up at cx, then I can also donate a bit, if someone could just fx it all or if they can take the ncc + whatever the fee would be charged to convert to AIC at FX price?


[22-Jan-24 03:54 PM] jvaler#0000
i can FX it for you, just send over NCC in batches of 250k. i'll eat the fee for simplicity's sake


[22-Jan-24 03:54 PM] jvaler#0000
do you want it sent back in AIC or for me to just go ahead and hand it out?


[22-Jan-24 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks and if your fine with sending extra contracts I'm fine with you just sending it to them


[22-Jan-24 04:02 PM] Deleted User#0000

[29-Jan-24 11:24 AM] havanista#0000
yeah no issues just a general remark, the last to come get more money üòâ


[29-Jan-24 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
250k was the agreed amount when most people joined, we've since moved it up.


[29-Jan-24 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Those who join now are given their 750k and backpay will be eventually offered to the people who came before.


[29-Jan-24 11:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Although at the minute I'm buying two full bases, both being higher tier which cost quite a lot, along with an entirely new ship from scratch for 4 something million, so my cash isn't amazingly abundant at the minute.


[29-Jan-24 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
There are other people involved within AGP who may be interested in working with our split idea but that's up to them.


[29-Jan-24 11:27 AM] havanista#0000
np, just a remark


[29-Jan-24 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Granted maybe backpay should've been the priority from the start.. but nevertheless.


[29-Jan-24 11:28 AM] havanista#0000
well, anyway now i start to be succesful, as for me i would less and less need the grant


[29-Jan-24 11:29 AM] havanista#0000
thks to kapusta, i've been developping faster; so well i can woth draw from the grant Program i guess


[29-Jan-24 11:29 AM] havanista#0000
with draw

That's still pretty early game haha, I'd assume about a year's worth is somewhat "vet", although that still may be pushing it.


[29-Jan-24 11:32 AM] havanista#0000
well i'm basically there, because i had a 3rd ship enterily sponsorized by Kaputa in construction and 2 WCB in the 2 starters ships, i guess it would have take me the full yrs to reach that normally


[29-Jan-24 11:33 AM] havanista#0000
maybe even more haha


[29-Jan-24 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
In comparison to most people who are "vets", that'd be pretty much nothing in terms of their wealth, although you've definitely gotten a headstart through ADI, so that's good at least.


[29-Jan-24 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Definitely nothing to be disappointed with.

Hi everyone!


[29-Jan-24 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hey.


[29-Jan-24 10:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I bring money!


[29-Jan-24 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the effort of full transparency I'm going to add you as a funder within the spreadsheet so that you can distribute the funds as you see fit.


[29-Jan-24 10:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay sure, sounds good. Is there a centralized account for the grant funds? Or are they handed out individually by the funders?


[29-Jan-24 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
And plus I don't like the financial strain that having 10m dedicated specifically to grants would put since they don't give us dedicated bank accounts, haha.


[29-Jan-24 10:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heh sure. We have the same issue with the OOG bank


[29-Jan-24 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the minute I add people waiting to the waiting list and whenever I'm or anyone else has the available funds we just sent a cont for the agreed amount.


[29-Jan-24 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
If we do split conts, as we have done, we'll just add two entries to the spreadsheet to accurately show each other's contribution.

#agp-information if you haven't seen it or want to know what I'm on about, not sure if you've browsed or not.


[29-Jan-24 10:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay that sounds good. I had previously been sending out 250k to anyone in ANT space who was 1) vaguely new and 2) had pro. I haven't really kept track but I'd guess maybe 10-20 recipients. Nice to have a wider organization for it though


[29-Jan-24 10:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I'm sort of slowly working though backlogs on various channels


[29-Jan-24 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
@AGP Backpay is now filling the waiting list (500k for everyone who already received 250k), we'll begin working through the backlog as we can.

If you want to donate your money to other people in the project (aka you don't want 500k), just let me know and we'll remove the entry and use it to fulfill someone elses.


[29-Jan-24 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
GAS is our other industrial project within ANT headed by @Deleted User but unfortunately it is kinda hit or miss with the activity of it, think it is a wip still.

I'm about to leave for work shortly and my work doesn't allow prun on the wifi so it'll most likely be later today until I send the conts and update the spreadsheet.


[29-Jan-24 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although I can fulfill all 4m as soon as I'm home.


[29-Jan-24 10:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well I can definitely fill the backlog too, no problem there

Let me get you added to the sheet so I can do that.

If you want to go ahead and send conts to those who are listed under your tag of AR go ahead, I'll fulfill them as I can myself after work. ^^

@higgsy Welcome to the AGP section! #agp-information has access to our spreadsheet which we use for funding, if you want to look through that you are free, I'll have to add you to the spreadsheet as a funder in a bit as I'm about to leave for work, but welcome and make yourself at home. ^^


[29-Jan-24 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think we may have to look into expanding our scheme a bit more given the new members, but we'll need a group discussion about that.


[30-Jan-24 10:04 AM] .decks#0000
How do I join the waitlist and also where would you guys like me to setup in ant space?


[30-Jan-24 10:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Waiting list addition is done manually by myself, as for where you should setup, that's up to you!

[30-Jan-24 10:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sure.


[30-Jan-24 10:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
These are just the ones I know 100% are good from my own experience, anyone else is free to drop in and add anything:

- Deimos is extremely popular, good infrastructure and is amazing for metallurgy, smelting ALO into AL, or just selling raw ALO on the local market can be profitable.
- Nike is relatively popular and is good for making bfabs out of the AL you smelt at Deimos, also has LST as well so that makes it even better for bfabs.
- Harmonia is a good agri world.
- Griffonstone is a good chemistry world.


[30-Jan-24 10:22 AM] .decks#0000
Sounds great, can‚Äôt wait to get started!


[30-Jan-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, that's all very good advice. Crops -> Rations and H2O -> Drinking water are one other great starting chain. Norwick is a popular choice for food processors. That can work well with water purchased on the CX or with crops grown on Harmonia


[30-Jan-24 10:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Deimos is full though, so unless you COLIQ to start over you probably wouldn't be able to build a base there. Vulcan is good for making FEO, which you could use on Nike for bfabs, but that shipping could be challenging at first


[30-Jan-24 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Do I go from start of the waiting list or bottom of the waiting list?


[30-Jan-24 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just look for anything that isn't labelled complete.

Hey @cdgwaddell  did you want to pass on your free 500k grant? It looks like you requested contract termination


[30-Jan-24 12:15 PM] jvaler#0000
i think that's cause that's how i did it with them previously lol


[30-Jan-24 12:15 PM] jvaler#0000
i no longer do that and just request 1 SF cause it's less confusing that way


[30-Jan-24 12:17 PM] jvaler#0000
saving the 10 AIC isn't worth the hassle

I think that's approximately what you're describing


[30-Jan-24 12:20 PM] jvaler#0000
i did a thing where i requested CMK and asked them to immediately term request, then i sent the money and completed the termination

didn't expect this side effect lmao


[30-Jan-24 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
It gave that "are you sure you want to fulfill a contract they tried to cancel?" message, so I had some doubts


[30-Jan-24 12:23 PM] jvaler#0000
good reminder for actual terminations but i was kinda misusing the system lol


[30-Jan-24 12:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah unfortunately it's just one bit of information and it could mean two things. I have seen others use the contracts that way. And it is a pain to buy DW if you don't have some laying around to fill the contract


[30-Jan-24 12:24 PM] jvaler#0000
i suspect SF would be a more common thing to store on a CX

ok that's what i do in Deimos, if u sell in Deimos i'll buy, anyway Alo price keeps dropping in anatres and Ben, before in ben it was at 125 , goes down to  95/85 now like Antares


[31-Jan-24 04:37 PM] jvaler#0000
nascent can be logistically intensive. if you need help you can post 500t(370 ALO) LM shipping ads nascent -> ANT at 3500 AIC and someone named Laichonious will pretty consistently pick them up.

no it's viable, see the diff


[31-Jan-24 04:59 PM] jvaler#0000
ANT <-> MOR rates are like 30+ currency per ton/m^3 right? and at 370 ALO per 500t that's -40 profit per ALO making it much less impressive. though that'd still be ~20 extra currency per ALO if you go through that hassle

this is theorizing on outsourcing shipping to the CX LM in the case that they can't export everything from nascent themselves, which is likely the case given it's nascent

Although I'm still available to provide, I'll probably just need a bit more time to secure funding.

Plan for a base on Griffonstone  https://prunplanner.org/shared/06472c9e-ce7c-436e-b81b-993a449bcf26 -- extra CL goes toward making EPO (on Umbra), extra HAL goes toward LI smelting, THF goes to shipbuilding needs (LFP and I'm not sure what else) .

I'll edit this message whenever this is no longer accurate, and to reiterate, **this is temporary**.

Any tips what i should or shouldn‚Äôt do to kickstart my company?


[14-Apr-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, there's probably a ton of information in the various associated channels. I think the short suggestions would generally be to max out your base on Deimos first. Align all your planet production with the COGC. So on Demios you probably want mostly/all SMEs to start. With 750k you probably have enough to max out a second cheap base as well.


[14-Apr-24 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
Personally I'd recommend a Nike base making fabs as your second. Then you have somewhere to use all that metal. And if metal prices have been low-ish, you can capture the income on the fab side.


[14-Apr-24 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
AL -> PP2 buildings probably.

I think the very early game (1 base) is probably the weakest part of the game until the later stages.

hmmmm....... I don't know if you are suggesting I "should" request a grant to help get me into the ... I dunno 2nd stage ? - just to speed up the game. Or are you maybe suggesting that I wait some months (towards end game) and then I request a grant ?

[19-Apr-24 11:20 PM] jvaler#0000
i highly recommend just buying the water off the CX, the price is especially low right now even. not that it's price is ever a major concern anyways because FRMs use so little of it


[19-Apr-24 11:21 PM] tanda#0000
if you're supplying harmonia, even just buying at 40 off the LM is worth it


[19-Apr-24 11:22 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000

[19-Apr-24 11:23 PM] jvaler#0000
sorry, 413k, forgot to remove an HB1


[19-Apr-24 11:24 PM] jvaler#0000
still that is an exorbitant price for those profit levels


[19-Apr-24 11:27 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
What price should I be looking for instead to have it be less costly then? For the future


[19-Apr-24 11:28 PM] jvaler#0000
not sure what you mean


[19-Apr-24 11:28 PM] jvaler#0000
do you mean like the return on investment period?


[19-Apr-24 11:28 PM] tanda#0000
isn't the rule of thumb to have an ROI of 20-30 days?


[19-Apr-24 11:28 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm


[19-Apr-24 11:28 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
Ah okay


[19-Apr-24 11:29 PM] jvaler#0000
30 is okay, 20 is good, anything less is great


[19-Apr-24 11:30 PM] jvaler#0000
FRMs being so cheap means they have very low ROI periods despite their otherwise average profit levels, which is why they're so good for less established players imo


[19-Apr-24 11:50 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
So if I wanted to also make drinking water I would still buy water from the CX, correct?


[19-Apr-24 11:55 PM] jvaler#0000
i see no reason why not


[20-Apr-24 04:48 PM] igfloz#0000
I have done some calculations and it is indeed a very slow early game. I think it would be extremely beneficial for me to "get on my feet" early game.

Grant Request: I just took a 1M loan to start half a base of Lfab production on Nike. Would love a grant to enable PP3 production as well. I haven't made any calculations yet, but I am sure another million would go a long way of enabling PP3s and getting inputs!

I'm considering applying for some funds to set up a CUO extraction base, as the CUO market is kinda crazy atm.
It would have to be something relatively small, starting off, something that can be serviced by a single starter ship, as I doubt I'll have funds to purchase anything larger anytime soon. Most, if not all of the CUO will go into smelting for another ADI member. I'm currently looking at LG-430b or KI-840c


[29-May-24 04:08 PM] jvaler#0000
do you have the logistics to handle something like that?


[29-May-24 04:12 PM] razesdark#0000
What I'm considering now produces only about 350-400t of ore a day. I think I am able to service that using primarilly one of my two starter ships, while only occationally having to use the second one to move the leftovers.

Alternatively, I can scale down a bit more


[29-May-24 04:13 PM] jvaler#0000
well that's on top of your current deimos base right? what's the BUI setup over there?


[29-May-24 04:14 PM] jvaler#0000
metallurgy can be tough to handle on starters(just like ore extraction)


[29-May-24 04:14 PM] razesdark#0000
My Deimos base is 4 smelters and two pp1s.


[29-May-24 04:14 PM] jvaler#0000
oh that's tiny, okay


[29-May-24 04:14 PM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, quite tiny üòâ


[29-May-24 04:14 PM] tanda#0000
round trip from Deimos to either of those places is 2 days+


[29-May-24 04:15 PM] jvaler#0000
wait but the CUO is going to the CX no?


[29-May-24 04:15 PM] jvaler#0000
that's 1 jump closer to the eastern sectors


[29-May-24 04:16 PM] tanda#0000
if you're putting out nearly a full ship a day of ore, with 22+ hour flight times in either direction, it's gonna tie up both of your ships


[29-May-24 04:17 PM] jvaler#0000
and any delays in sending out the ships will slowly stack up

[29-May-24 04:17 PM] razesdark#0000
I figured i'dd produce 700ish per round trip, leaving me with the need to add the second ship every 2,5 round trip


[29-May-24 04:18 PM] jvaler#0000
would be 15-20k AIC per starter load for anything reliable out there though


[29-May-24 04:19 PM] jvaler#0000
@razesdark between KI-840c and LG-430b you should probably go with KI-840c. LG-430b takes TSH to build and repair and that is *expensive*

Thinking about building a construction facility on Nascent mainly making LDEs. Its similar to my first base which seems to be doing well. Would that be suitable for a grant application or is it more metallurgy focused?

Nascent runs Resource Extraction CoGC, so it's not going to be the best spot making anything really

[08-Jun-24 03:33 PM] zeepad#0000
LDEs just seem so profitable right now


[08-Jun-24 03:34 PM] .shiva.#0000
so the CoGC bonuses are 25%, which is pretty huge


[08-Jun-24 03:34 PM] .shiva.#0000
so usually you want to try and align with those as much as possible


[08-Jun-24 03:34 PM] tanda#0000
so, immediately next door to Nike is Deimos, which is the hub for AL production in the sector. Nike also produces LST so if NL gets expensive you can always swap to BBH and BSE production easily


[08-Jun-24 03:35 PM] tanda#0000
I myself run a construction base on Nike and it is honestly the second least logistically complex of my bases. I import AL from my own supply and buy LST from the local market


[08-Jun-24 03:35 PM] tanda#0000
in your case the CX is 1 jump away for NL sourcing


[08-Jun-24 03:36 PM] tanda#0000
Nascent has decent ALO sources, but I don't suspect a lot of people do smelting on site there, most gets exported to Deimos for processing


[08-Jun-24 03:37 PM] igfloz#0000
If it helps, I am (slowly) producing NL on Hephaestus 3.3/d - I normally drop on ANT to sell


[08-Jun-24 03:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
unless you're planning on COLIQing, I'd personally really look closer to home for now


[08-Jun-24 03:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
but that's just me


[08-Jun-24 03:38 PM] tanda#0000
also as a member of ADI now, you have access to an internal market. I offer AL at 500 internally, though my supply is limited


[08-Jun-24 03:38 PM] tanda#0000
considering I and others regularly import AL to Nike, I would say it's probably less logistically complex if you don't mind having to use contracts to source AL


[08-Jun-24 03:39 PM] zeepad#0000
Ooo that changes a few things


[08-Jun-24 03:41 PM] zeepad#0000
I think its time to go back to the drawing board. Thanks for the help guys!

[09-Jun-24 01:59 AM] evany.#0000
@zeepad  unless your really tied to it for some reason if the intention is to move and you have premium, i'd maybe recommend just giving someone your money and stuff then coliq'ing to restart if you want to move to antares. youll only get maybe 75% of your stuff back  depending on its repair level which won't give you enough stuff to straight up move without eating into your reserves, which kind of makes it a bit pointless.
you would still lose all experts etc either way so just more food for thought. (coliq is what they call restarting in this for some reason)


[09-Jun-24 04:43 AM] zeepad#0000
I mean I'm having fun as it is so I'm not too interested in restarting.
I think my goal right now is to build a new construction base somewhere suitable and restructure my current base to match its bonus

10 BMPs, perhaps? üòÑ

{Reactions}
1_ 2_ 

[15-Jun-24 01:22 PM] razenpok#0000
My plan initially was to buffer for 3 days (I had 500k on hand to start it off). I'm up for bumping up the number of BMPs, but I have a couple of concerns:
- @ 12 BMPs I would need to supply my base every 1.5 days, which kind of locks one of my starter ships in one place. I'm actually a fan of LM, so if I could end up on a planet with local STL production, that would be super cool, but alas.
- 12 BMPs would produce 300 PT per day, which might be too much for current CX demand. Given that I'm just starting out and will be running production with a small buffer, I could end up with too many PTs on my hand, unable to buy more inputs to continue producing more PTs. I could also source them to other CXs, which would lock my second ship in place.


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that make sense. There's nothing wrong with starting with 5 and seeing how things go


[15-Jun-24 01:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Though there should be plenty of other profitable things you could make with BMP on Heph, if you're interested in standing up more than 5


[15-Jun-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd recommend diversifying your BMP recipes for multiple benefits. if you make less PT and more of other things you'll use less STL, which is a highly dense material and difficult to transport with a starter ship. you'll also make yourself much more immune to market fluctuations and will be able to sell your product easier. if you make too much PT it can actually be difficult to sell due to not enough daily demand


[15-Jun-24 01:30 PM] razenpok#0000
Ye, I think I can do PT+EXO+PWO, adding WPL to the mix
