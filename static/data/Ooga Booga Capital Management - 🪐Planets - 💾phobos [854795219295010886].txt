@figaro0714 how much do you think it would cost you to make 8 LBH? Break even price before profits


[19-Jun-21 06:01 PM] figaro0714#0000
Cost about 900/u so 8 LBH will be around 7200


[19-Jun-21 06:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
How much time to make all 8 from your current setup? And how many settlers/pioneers do you have on base?


[19-Jun-21 06:06 PM] figaro0714#0000
Will take about 60 hours, or 2.5 days. And i currently have 155 Pioneers and 25 Settlers


[19-Jun-21 06:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Nice. I am not ready to commission any work right now but I would pay fairly for this order on phobos, all local trade.


[19-Jun-21 06:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its needed for a POL

Warehouse is build on phobos now. @kimmyjiko you may consider renting some space here if you will be trading to/from this planet


[21-Jun-21 03:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
convenience only, its not required


[21-Jun-21 03:13 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
I may do so in the near future


[21-Jun-21 03:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It would allow you to accept buy/sell offers whenever you like instead of only when your ship is present


[21-Jun-21 03:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So you could dump 1000 RAT in the warehouse or w/e and just take every buy offer, for example


[26-Jun-21 08:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 we have some ships coming ANT -> Phobos if you want to pick up free shipping


[26-Jun-21 09:43 PM] figaro0714#0000
I do, i got 80t if there's space


[27-Jun-21 05:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea should be fine.

they can depart tomorrow, dont forget to provision the items


[28-Jun-21 12:36 AM] figaro0714#0000
I have a ship on ANT with the items but its not letting me provision


[28-Jun-21 02:02 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you might need to pay for warehouse space


[29-Jun-21 01:52 PM] figaro0714#0000

[29-Jun-21 02:03 PM] figaro0714#0000

[29-Jun-21 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alucard has ALO in the phobos warehouse and has stated that he is accepting buy offers on Phobos LM at 53/each

[29-Jun-21 03:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He doesnt have a phobos base so he can only accept phobos LM offers, not post


[01-Jul-21 08:07 PM] figaro0714#0000
Anyone selling NL?


[01-Jul-21 08:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We dont have a weaving plant WPL in corp sadly


[01-Jul-21 10:45 PM] figaro0714#0000
Yea maybe in the future


[01-Jul-21 10:47 PM] insensless72#0000
A weaving plant would be great to have in corp though. PP2 need it to make LDE and its 2.5K on market rn. Production cost is like 1k


[02-Jul-21 12:20 AM] figaro0714#0000
I can build one but it'll postpone the pp3 by a couple weeks


[04-Jul-21 09:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
whatever is more profitable for you


[05-Jul-21 08:43 AM] insensless72#0000
I have a ship with 220 ALO, 15 BBh and 10 BSE headed to Phobos rn. It will arrive in 1 day 13hrs if anyone needs anything off it, let me know


[05-Jul-21 01:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
earthling has your sealant ready for when you arrive


[05-Jul-21 08:18 PM] figaro0714#0000
@insensless72 I'll take 120 ALO, but can i have it on a long term contract cause I'm short on cash rn


[05-Jul-21 08:28 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah man, im only going to ask a flat 6k for the stack so we can work it out


[05-Jul-21 08:28 PM] insensless72#0000
i might need some bfabs for lfabs with this Nike expansion


[05-Jul-21 08:44 PM] insensless72#0000
@figaro0714 saw your post on gen how do you feel about this?


[05-Jul-21 10:13 PM] figaro0714#0000
I can help u with the the fabs, i almost have a WPL up and running so it'll easier. And 6k sounds good @insensless72


[06-Jul-21 01:32 AM] insensless72#0000
Id love early access to NL, that would be great


[06-Jul-21 12:38 PM] figaro0714#0000
@insensless72 what fabs are u needing so i can start building them?


[06-Jul-21 12:41 PM] insensless72#0000
I actually dont know yet, I need to get the base built first. Idk if it comes with a HAB or not


[06-Jul-21 12:43 PM] figaro0714#0000
Lmk when u can


[06-Jul-21 10:14 PM] insensless72#0000
@figaro0714 Ship is on Phobos now, lmk when you can accept that ALO order


[06-Jul-21 10:42 PM] figaro0714#0000
@insensless72 in an hour


[06-Jul-21 10:43 PM] insensless72#0000
You got it, message me


[09-Jul-21 10:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Tomorrow I will have a POL with pioneers only. It will do 500 PG in 14 days. Becomes about 3x faster when i build an HB2 for settlers

Buying Carbon


[11-Jul-21 03:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Cant sell C right now. I wont really be able to until I get another INC + HB1


[11-Jul-21 03:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am making RCO at the moment, I could transition that farmstead time into HCP, and use the faster but more expensive carbon recipe


[11-Jul-21 03:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also could sell you some RCO if you were interested


[11-Jul-21 01:38 PM] figaro0714#0000
Whats ur price for RCO?


[11-Jul-21 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can do 425 each in corp


[11-Jul-21 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There are a few WPL on Phobos competing with each other, buying RCO at 450+. I want you to have a slight advantage when it comes time to sell


[11-Jul-21 03:02 PM] figaro0714#0000
I'll let u know when im ready to buy


[11-Jul-21 03:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
10 for 4250 is what is available right now


[12-Jul-21 02:18 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape I'll take 6 at 425


[12-Jul-21 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 make a phobos LM buy offer


[12-Jul-21 05:38 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape posted


[13-Jul-21 11:56 PM] figaro0714#0000
I have 4 LBH to sell at 1600 each if anyone wants it


[14-Jul-21 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mm I remember paying more than that recently ü§ë


[15-Jul-21 11:46 AM] figaro0714#0000
Ya prefab prices have dropped but also my input costs have dropped so i can offer it cheaper


[16-Jul-21 01:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mmm there is a tempting phobos LM offer to buy 200 PG @ 19 each (3800 total)


[16-Jul-21 02:01 PM] figaro0714#0000
I can buy PG @20 üëÄ


[16-Jul-21 02:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Can you do 200 for 4000 total?


[16-Jul-21 02:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats what I have available now. I could use that cash to kick start much higher production rates


[16-Jul-21 03:15 PM] figaro0714#0000
I can do that


[16-Jul-21 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you post a buy offer Ill take it


[16-Jul-21 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 Next batch of PG goes to you


[16-Jul-21 03:16 PM] figaro0714#0000
Do u mind if i post in an hour?


[16-Jul-21 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea no rush


[16-Jul-21 03:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
figaro what will you make with the PG? I would avoid making BDEs since it is much cheaper to make them in a PP1 using PE


[16-Jul-21 05:06 PM] figaro0714#0000
LSE and NL for LDE


[16-Jul-21 05:06 PM] figaro0714#0000
Posted


[16-Jul-21 05:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea that is a good move.  I predict increasing demand for LDEs. LSE im not so sure, but they will be bought regardless


[16-Jul-21 07:33 PM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape Sweet thanks man


[17-Jul-21 02:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
With Tycho Manufacturing quitting the game, thats minus a few production buildings on phobos. His base was built up


[17-Jul-21 02:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
-2 BMP
-1 WPL
-1 PPF

Probably others that I didnt learn about


[17-Jul-21 09:37 AM] sempyrfi#0000
Good morning crew! A few questions: ‚ùì 
1. is refueling as simple as clicking and dragging the desired fuel into the tank tile?
2. For ship repairs, is the ‚ÄúRepair‚Äù button only available after a certain amount of damage?
3. If I place a sell order, does it immediately take the item(s) out of my ship's cargo hold, or does the ship need to remain until the product is sold?


[17-Jul-21 11:56 AM] figaro0714#0000
@sempyrfi 1. Yup, 3. It immediately takes from ur ship. Idk about repairs

local market


[17-Jul-21 01:39 PM] figaro0714#0000
I dont need iron anymore since i dont have a PP1. I just got feo at such a good price, flipping it into FE was a easy choice


[17-Jul-21 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ooo i thought you still had a PP1


[17-Jul-21 01:45 PM] figaro0714#0000
Got rid of that soon after i got a WPL. And the cost savings is gonna be important for my PP3


[17-Jul-21 03:32 PM] sempyrfi#0000
I‚Äôll definitely let you know later today


[17-Jul-21 07:49 PM] figaro0714#0000
Im thinking of making a INC for my C supply. Lmk if u guys have any thoughts on that


[17-Jul-21 07:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Its pretty low cost. The most efficient recipe is 4 GRN -> 4C and it would cover your two smelters


[17-Jul-21 07:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You would be inefficient in terms of splitting your experts up or running INC with no experts but for 2 smelters it would work


[17-Jul-21 07:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe 3 smelters


[17-Jul-21 07:53 PM] insensless72#0000
If you go that route I would be willing to buy your extra C


[17-Jul-21 08:38 PM] figaro0714#0000
It will help with the SME but also for PG if i build a POL. PG is really needed atm


[18-Jul-21 12:46 PM] figaro0714#0000
@sempyrfi got 16 FE when ur ready


[18-Jul-21 01:41 PM] sempyrfi#0000

[02-Aug-21 07:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you post the sell offers for 2 each on the LM at the 1500 and 3000 price respectively, they will accept the offers


[02-Aug-21 09:36 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape I'll take a few days to get the LBH made

No rush, I will buy 8 from you whenever you have them ready

Lol yeah I‚Äôm at like 120 H2O in 2 hrs more


[04-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kimmyjiko#0000
Probably 24.something per day


[04-Aug-21 08:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that is per rig?

Yep

@figaro0714 organized a buy of 60 THF @21000 AIC on Phobos, within 5 days


[05-Aug-21 12:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Getting AR will require some flying but it is available at 175 each with some shipping contracts as well to offset price


[05-Aug-21 02:43 PM] figaro0714#0000
Is anyone shipping from Ant to Pho in the next day or so?


[05-Aug-21 04:41 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm coming to Ant in 16h and from there to Pho, and I might have some free space.


[05-Aug-21 04:42 PM] spatial_piano#0000

@bitcoin_ape Let me know when you have a good amount of PG. I can arrange a shipment of LST to Phobos if there is interest


[06-Aug-21 10:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will let you know. We can organize a LST delivery and PG/assorted goodies export round trip


[06-Aug-21 10:52 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Currently I have about 4 days to raise 18-20k AIC


[06-Aug-21 10:53 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For the THF buy


[06-Aug-21 11:04 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I burn a lot of LST so I'll take whatever you can carry.


[06-Aug-21 11:04 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have a lot in storage,so I'm not in a hurry to get it though.


[06-Aug-21 11:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This weekend I will organize something to get daily material usage numbers by player, and by extension, by planet


[06-Aug-21 11:19 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For example, mark, figaro, and earthling are consuming LST on phobos daily. I will get estimates numbers from them and come up with an estimate of net corporate LST usage per day on phobos which will inform our logistics planning


[06-Aug-21 11:19 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
same deal for consumables on deimos, PG, etc.


[06-Aug-21 11:23 AM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano I can fit 183 LST on a ship, I produce 210 every 3 days currently so let us know what you burn through on Phobos


[06-Aug-21 11:37 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Depends on how many BMPs I'm using for MCG. I'm currently burning 16.24 per day, but when I'm running double I burn 34.6.


[06-Aug-21 11:42 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Basically one ship per 5 days when running double.

[08-Aug-21 08:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano Missed the above from this morning, sorry. I will buy those two in a week.


[08-Aug-21 08:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At that time would probably buy 75 OVE and 30 PWO

@bitcoin_ape how much dpace u got and when u leaving?


[12-Aug-21 08:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At least 250 T but probably more, and departure date is flexible


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I would prefer to wait 24 hours to depart but I can wait longer


[12-Aug-21 09:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol Manofthesea all over my shit for posting 9 AIC per tonne shipping rate from ANT -> Phobos


[13-Aug-21 02:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I got 77t of LST to haul from ANT if you still have space. It's a lot of tonnage so I'll chip in for gas at least.

Sounds good, but I am covered for now

I should probably be building more POL instead of a second base but I am committed now, and covered on hydrogen for a few weeks


[18-Aug-21 03:38 PM] figaro0714#0000

[18-Aug-21 03:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you mean in terms of a 2nd base or building more on phobos?

@colerror check out the Phobos chamber of commerce. The manufacturers easily win but I have been trying to get the pioneer vote up lately..


[21-Aug-21 11:23 AM] colerror#0000
We might have enough people on Phobos to take an election too


[21-Aug-21 11:32 AM] colerror#0000
Not sure what that'd give us


[21-Aug-21 11:44 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It would give us a headache hahaha


[21-Aug-21 11:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Technically if a corporation member is governor of a planet, that corporation is considered the ruling entity, and the tax income goes to them.


[21-Aug-21 11:46 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the tax income is distributed evenly among share holders, since we all have 1000 shares.


[21-Aug-21 11:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We would still need about 20 outside votes for our candidate, and there would be much discussion about the candidate leaving OOG to be governor in a separate single-person corporation


[21-Aug-21 11:55 AM] colerror#0000
It does seem like a bit of a pain that the Corp can't hold funds, and you can't transfer funds outside of LM

@spatial_piano I hope I dont hurt your feelings by pumping the pioneer bonus in Phobos chat


[22-Aug-21 12:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I know you benefit massively from +25% manufacturing


[22-Aug-21 12:43 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It's fine. The +25 on nearly everything is pretty neat, but the other option is still 10% on all my basic production.


[22-Aug-21 12:44 PM] spatial_piano#0000
As long as you don't expect me to vote against my own interests without persuasuasion.


[22-Aug-21 12:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol no you can vote how you like


[22-Aug-21 12:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont know if I could persuade you with something better than net +15% output on your BMPs and WPL and PPF


[22-Aug-21 12:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that would be.. expensive...


[22-Aug-21 12:46 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Cost would be higher than what you would benefit from my 550 weight.


[22-Aug-21 12:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if it was within 1100 votes difference, your flip would swing the vote


[22-Aug-21 12:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
still I would break even at best. it would be to the benefit of figaro, colerr, and earthing at that point

@spatial_piano How much PE do you have on Phobos?


[24-Aug-21 06:55 AM] spatial_piano#0000

I'm producing currently about 650/day, but I can go much faster if needed


[24-Aug-21 06:59 AM] spatial_piano#0000
temporarily that is


[24-Aug-21 06:59 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I can sustain about 800/day on my INC


[24-Aug-21 07:00 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have enough C for 2000


[24-Aug-21 11:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Anyone need Carbon right now? I've got 32 currently, which will be 40 in 12 hours


[26-Aug-21 12:27 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror No cash on hand for me. Earthling has just stocked up on C from the market (just in time for prices to fall)


[26-Aug-21 12:36 AM] colerror#0000
Yea, this price drop is gonna kill me. Luckily, I don't need to sell right now


[26-Aug-21 12:38 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea I would say stock up for now, funnel some in at market rates to cover consumables


[26-Aug-21 12:44 AM] colerror#0000
Yea, I've got 11 days of consumables, but I'll need to stock up again in about a week, because I'll be phone only for a couple weeks


[26-Aug-21 12:55 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can arrange contracts on phobos LM for several ration/drinking water deliveries


[26-Aug-21 12:56 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so you can accept/fulfill the offers on mobile through phobos inventories only without needing to drag and drop


[26-Aug-21 10:10 AM] colerror#0000
Yea, my plan if needed was to just run shipping contracts worst case


[26-Aug-21 11:33 AM] spatial_piano#0000

[26-Aug-21 12:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[26-Aug-21 12:38 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm not in a hurry really. PE is down to 4.5 at CX, so 9k will do


[26-Aug-21 12:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Cool. I will buy it this weekend with my next PG revenue.


[26-Aug-21 12:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano what do you think about supplying PWO + OVE for regular shipments to harmonia? You can sell on Phobos, Earthling would be the one flying.


[26-Aug-21 12:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
initially it is looking like 1000 in-corp pioneers on harmonia, if you are wondering about volume


[26-Aug-21 12:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Any extra supply could be sold into the harmonia LM


[26-Aug-21 12:45 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sounds good to me.


[26-Aug-21 12:45 PM] spatial_piano#0000
How often there would be a shipment?


[26-Aug-21 01:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can currently offer them @70 an @150 in-corp, but I'll trade cheaper if I'm paid in RCO. I can trade @60 and @120 vs RCO bid price (currently  about 4RCO to 30 OVE or 15 PWO)


[26-Aug-21 02:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I expect shipments at least every 14 days. There will certainly be potential to send RCO the other direction. Maybe @sempyrfi would be interested in that kind of arrangement


[26-Aug-21 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also earthling will have FRMs, not sure what the excess agriculture capacity will look like after prioritizing FPs but that could be another source of RCO


[26-Aug-21 02:28 PM] sempyrfi#0000
I could add 1-2 more FRM specific to RCO in a couple weeks or so


[26-Aug-21 02:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
How much RCO can you make in 10 days with one of your FRMs? you can queue a pretend order to see without doing too much math


[26-Aug-21 02:30 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Until I get COF and PWO I cant. Its been difficult getting those supplies when needed


[26-Aug-21 02:31 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Im still waiting on DW


[26-Aug-21 02:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea dont change your production right now, just queue an RCO order and tell me how fast it would go, and then delete the order before anything happens


[26-Aug-21 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh i see, temporarily short on consumables so its not an accurate number right now


[26-Aug-21 07:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi a single FRM at 100% efficiency will do 1.67 RCO per day, which is about 11 RCO per week.

So you could theoretically have 20+ RCO on biweekly shipments.


[26-Aug-21 07:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you and @spatial_piano  did the straight RCO --> OVE+PWO trade according Mark's ratios up there, It would be roughly:

20 RCO = 75 OVE + 38 PWO


[26-Aug-21 07:38 PM] sempyrfi#0000
@bitcoin_ape so naturally it should be 2 FRMs. 20/wk sounds better to me üòÜ


[26-Aug-21 07:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
RCO are high-value items üôÇ 20 is quite valuable


[26-Aug-21 07:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So yea 20/week does sound quite good üí∞


[26-Aug-21 11:50 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sounds very good. 20 RCO + 500 PG/week provides OVE and PWO for 10700 workers. Processing 20 RCO to COT every week would leave only 2 days per week to produce NL on WPL, which is a bit under 5 NL/week. If I get KOM that would go up to around 7.5 NL/week.


[29-Aug-21 12:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Anybody need any NL BTW? I have 4 available, but I'm taking them to CX tomorrow if nobody needs them.


[29-Aug-21 02:53 PM] figaro0714#0000
What the price for NL?


[29-Aug-21 03:44 PM] spatial_piano#0000
1850 with the current PG price but insensless already ordered 10. He isn't in a hurry so I can sell you 2-3 if you need them quickly.


[29-Aug-21 05:46 PM] figaro0714#0000
No thats fine


[29-Aug-21 08:51 PM] colerror#0000
If anyone is going to be needing Carbon, let me know. I've got 52 right now, and it will be 60 in 12 hours.


[29-Aug-21 10:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror whats the price if buying on phobos LM?


[29-Aug-21 10:41 PM] colerror#0000
I'll throw it up for 275/ea if anyone here wants it


[29-Aug-21 10:42 PM] colerror#0000
Can probably go a bit cheaper too, I know the CX is all over the place


[29-Aug-21 10:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling will buy 60 C @16500 , 275 each.


[29-Aug-21 10:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
market price average is 286 right now so its decent


[29-Aug-21 10:44 PM] colerror#0000
Ok, let me know in the morning (I'll be up around 8am PST) and I'll throw it up, since I assume we can't set it for specific people


[29-Aug-21 10:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea sounds good. I will get earthling to post a buy offer and you can accept it then.


[29-Aug-21 10:45 PM] colerror#0000
Sounds good


[29-Aug-21 11:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano can you sell 2000 PE to Figaro at the rate you were going to sell to me?


[29-Aug-21 11:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I was going to give it to him anyways to make the rest of my INS. @figaro0714 just add this to the end of the previously agreed INS price and I will pay you back in full at the time of sale


[30-Aug-21 09:59 AM] colerror#0000
Ready whenever Earthling is


[30-Aug-21 11:52 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. figaro has the PE now. I lowered the price to 8500 with the market price.


[30-Aug-21 11:53 AM] figaro0714#0000
Buying PG, 1220 over the next week.


[30-Aug-21 12:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will make 1800 PG in the next 7 days, and I have 400 in inventory. I will sell in corp slightly below market rate


[30-Aug-21 12:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The profits from this PG will be used firstly to pay @figaro0714 for the remainder of the INS, and then to build another POL


[30-Aug-21 12:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If you need to, you can pioritize figaro over me since he'll be making me AEF. I'm good for at least 3 days, probably longer.


[30-Aug-21 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you can wait 3 days without issues then I should sell the first 500 to figaro tonight


[30-Aug-21 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
then 2 days after that I can sell you 500

@spatial_piano are you prepping to settle a gas planet? will it be the cold ammonia one?


[30-Aug-21 12:14 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. I still need 750 INS and the fabs in addition to the AEF.


[30-Aug-21 12:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Okay there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem with the INS right now. Sea of Dirac has the only LAB on phobos right now and he told me the other day that he cant get any AMM for a THF order


[30-Aug-21 12:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So in order to get INS on phobos we need to first import ammonia, and argon a few days after that but it is easier to buy argon around here


[30-Aug-21 12:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I just messaged him and he isnt actively trying to get AMM, just waiting on somebody to ship it to ANT


[30-Aug-21 12:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It will take him about 3 days to make the THF, and it will then take Figaro about 9(?) days to make that into INS assuming the AR is on phobos by then.


[30-Aug-21 12:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so basically ~2 weeks from the time we get AMM on planet


[30-Aug-21 12:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ok, so the plan would be to have 8 AMM shipped from Benten. How often there is a ship coming?


[30-Aug-21 12:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats a question for the UFO server. I can look into it after work today


[30-Aug-21 12:57 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I posted an ad for the shipping. Let's hope somebody picks it up.


[01-Sep-21 12:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sempyrfi you can definitely see it on the latest pop report, which happened to be tonight:

Cheap hydrogen on Phobos LM


[02-Sep-21 04:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I got the 8 AMM now on CX. Is somebody coming from there any time soon?


[02-Sep-21 04:10 PM] figaro0714#0000
I'm at CX, will be heading back in 1.5 days


[02-Sep-21 04:11 PM] figaro0714#0000
Also I'm looking to source AMM for THF if anyone can help with that


[02-Sep-21 04:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Once I get the base on QJ-382g you can bathe in AMM


[02-Sep-21 04:20 PM] figaro0714#0000
When will that be?


[02-Sep-21 04:21 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Well I currently have the money for it but the materials are underway.


[02-Sep-21 04:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000
You're doing the AEF, Nobody is doing the INS or the fabs yet


[02-Sep-21 04:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000
could be 2 more weeks


[02-Sep-21 04:22 PM] figaro0714#0000
I could do the INS, just need the THF


[02-Sep-21 04:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yep. I'll ask Dirac if he can get the THF underway once I get the AMM here.


[02-Sep-21 04:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
His LAB is on phobos, right?


[02-Sep-21 04:24 PM] figaro0714#0000
I got no clue


[02-Sep-21 04:25 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. I'll better check before I post a shipping order.


[02-Sep-21 04:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano yes dirac has a LAB on phobos


[02-Sep-21 05:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i want one too :/


[03-Sep-21 05:53 PM] figaro0714#0000
ANT > Phobos leaving in the next couple hours. 242t of space left and 293m3


[03-Sep-21 05:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll take 240.24 t of that if nobody else needs anything moved.


[03-Sep-21 06:02 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@figaro0714  Have you checked phobos LM BTW? There's  several shipping contacts available for ANT->PHO.


[03-Sep-21 06:03 PM] figaro0714#0000
I have but i wanted to check in with the corp first


[03-Sep-21 06:04 PM] figaro0714#0000
U can list the shipping contract


[03-Sep-21 10:04 PM] figaro0714#0000
Leaving in one hour, still the same amount of space left


[04-Sep-21 06:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Sorry, I started doing something else and forgot to post. Hope you didn't wait for me.


[04-Sep-21 12:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano do you have 60 MCG on phobos?


[04-Sep-21 12:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yes, but I'm about to ship everything out. I'll have more in 1h and 20 min


[04-Sep-21 12:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea delivery in 2 hours or w/e is fine


[04-Sep-21 12:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
whats your price on phobos?


[04-Sep-21 12:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh wait I actually need 100 MCG.


[04-Sep-21 12:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The price is prettyinsane still, but lets say 2k for 100. the dalivery time is the same as for 60

Are there any new bases coming up in the near future BTW? The PSL market is a bit full, so I'm thinking about taking the PPF down for a week or so. It needs repair anyway, so it would be a decent chance for downtime.

Buying 24 C


[21-Sep-21 08:03 PM] colerror#0000
I can get you, but it will take a little because I just sent what I had to the CX


[21-Sep-21 08:04 PM] colerror#0000
Haven't sold yet, just en route


[21-Sep-21 08:14 PM] colerror#0000
Carbon prices are nuts, and the supply is super low


[21-Sep-21 08:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea it just sold on phobos for 400 each


[21-Sep-21 08:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ask on LM is 465

the high volume could have been at the bottom/middle of the candlestick


[21-Sep-21 08:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or it coulld have been 600*600 which is hilarious


[21-Sep-21 08:17 PM] colerror#0000
High volume brought it up as far as I could tell


[21-Sep-21 08:18 PM] colerror#0000
I think someone bought 400+ on no limit


[21-Sep-21 08:19 PM] figaro0714#0000
@colerror how much for 24 C?


[21-Sep-21 08:21 PM] colerror#0000
320 each? Won't be back on Phobos until this time tomorrow at the earliest


[21-Sep-21 08:28 PM] figaro0714#0000
Sounds good, lmk when u can do the trade


[21-Sep-21 11:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano @figaro0714 @insensless72 I will have 2000 PG on phobos in about 48 hours, and plan to fly to ANT and then KI-401 from there


[21-Sep-21 11:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If anyone wants to buy the PG on phobos or at ANT it will be available, but I will sell it all on this trip somehow.


[22-Sep-21 05:37 AM] insensless72#0000
Ill buy some off you at ANT


[22-Sep-21 01:30 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll buy at least 500


[22-Sep-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano we an make a contract for 500 tomorrow


[22-Sep-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
pesky timezones interfering with my revenue


[22-Sep-21 10:17 PM] colerror#0000
@figaro0714 Let me know when you're good, I'll have it available in about an hour, but can accept a contract in the mean time


[23-Sep-21 01:18 PM] figaro0714#0000
Buying 80 MCG


[23-Sep-21 01:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@figaro0714 that'll be 1600


[23-Sep-21 05:08 PM] colerror#0000
Any thoughts on what I should move into next? I've got two INC going full time backed up by 3 farms, but I should probably think about diversfying


[23-Sep-21 08:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror on phobos you could go from carbon into chemistry or manufacturing


[23-Sep-21 08:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Another option is to double down into resource extraction and get an extractor for SIO and more INC


[23-Sep-21 10:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 @spatial_piano ~~Mark is going to produce some NL to make my lab on phobos. I need a PP2 to turn it into LDE, for üí∞ of course~~

Insensless has 16 LDE lol. I thought he had 4. Anyways I will be buying those and not hijacking everyones production


[23-Sep-21 10:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Then we can make INS much cheaper in corp if I am making the THF with Ammonia from QJ-382g.


[24-Sep-21 02:06 PM] colerror#0000
Well, I think I've min-maxed production as well as I can for now. Now, to hope that I have enough float to let it run


[24-Sep-21 02:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
dropping an SIO extractor while running resource experts is guaranteed to pay for itself


[24-Sep-21 02:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you stay in the expertise field but you diversify your revenue stream by selling the ore


[24-Sep-21 02:12 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, I'll need another hab before an EXT, but I think that's a good plan. Just trying to min-max C production without micromanaging it, which is making my resource queues into a total mess


[24-Sep-21 02:12 PM] colerror#0000
At current prices, with current set up, spreadsheet is showing $3500/day in profits


[25-Sep-21 09:33 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@colerror Can you sell me 20 C?


[25-Sep-21 10:07 AM] colerror#0000
Yea, let me know what you think is fair


[25-Sep-21 01:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@colerror will 6200 do?


[25-Sep-21 01:23 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, that's fine


[25-Sep-21 01:24 PM] colerror#0000
Let me know if you're posting, or you want me to


[25-Sep-21 01:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll post


[25-Sep-21 01:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000

@colerror I will buy 25C if you have it


[26-Sep-21 12:22 PM] colerror#0000
I actually just sent what I had to the CX. If you can wait, I can do it though


[26-Sep-21 12:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Sure, lets make the contract. What is a good delivery time for you to produce them?


[26-Sep-21 12:23 PM] colerror#0000
I can do a day. Just need to stop by CX to pick up supplies


[26-Sep-21 12:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ill make it 2 days then


[26-Sep-21 12:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
price per?


[26-Sep-21 12:24 PM] colerror#0000
Price is down, 300 good?


[26-Sep-21 12:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I was going to do 310 like mark haha


[26-Sep-21 12:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so 7750


[26-Sep-21 12:25 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, that's fine

[26-Sep-21 12:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks. Dont burn too much fuel jetting around on a tight schedule


[26-Sep-21 12:35 PM] colerror#0000
It's fine. 4.5h to get there, then I'll let it coast back overnight


[28-Sep-21 02:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Just sold SIO at 84 AIC each. New record I think


[28-Sep-21 02:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Jeez, I gotta start considering a second EXT.


[28-Sep-21 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont even mind selling it below 50 in corp. It means I dont need to ship it üôÇ


[28-Sep-21 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nice to get a premium on the CX though


[28-Sep-21 05:12 PM] figaro0714#0000
Buying 20 FLX


[30-Sep-21 08:55 PM] insensless72#0000
I have a ship landing at ANT in 9hrs and its going to Phobos from there. Let me know if you have anything you need shipped


[01-Oct-21 12:07 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@insensless72 I left some shipping contracts to Phobos LM. there's about 150t but if you can't fit them all don't worry about it.


[01-Oct-21 06:33 AM] insensless72#0000
ANT -> Phobos 10hrs


[01-Oct-21 06:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano @figaro0714 500 PG on Phobos if you want it


[02-Oct-21 03:05 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I don't have an urgent need, but I'll buy them if  Figaro doesn't need them


[02-Oct-21 07:41 PM] figaro0714#0000
@spatial_piano dont need any atm


[03-Oct-21 02:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano ill sell you the 500 tomorrow when im online


[03-Oct-21 02:07 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror I think earthling and I will buy a big carbon order on phobos if you are interested


[03-Oct-21 02:07 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If other corp members want to buy some that is fine too


[03-Oct-21 09:16 AM] colerror#0000
I've got 26 at the moment, making about 10/day


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
10/day is roughly my personal carbon usage.


[03-Oct-21 11:48 AM] figaro0714#0000
Buying 25 C


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Figaro is fine to take that, I need to find 100-200 somewhere


[03-Oct-21 12:07 PM] colerror#0000
@figaro0714 I can do it whenever you're available. 350 ea?


[03-Oct-21 02:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have a full ship on the AMM planet by tomorrow, with about 200 AMM and 300 H. I'll pop by ANT, but I'll be bringing nearly all of it to Phobos in about 2 days. I want to keep at least 50 AMM and 150 H for myself, but everything else is for sale. For the first batch I can do AMM@77 and H@100 in corp.


[03-Oct-21 02:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Also does Earthling still have a CHP, and is he still the only one? I'd need NAB for starting up the REF.


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] colerror#0000
I've been trying to figure out what to diversify into, CHP might be one of those things I can build into


[03-Oct-21 03:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I wont have that big of a demand for NAB with just one REF for now, so earthling can probably handle it.


[03-Oct-21 04:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthlings CHP is mostly reserved to make NS and we would be missing BOR


[03-Oct-21 04:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If there is a way to get BOR i can run it with 3+ chemistry experts


[03-Oct-21 04:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000
we would only need like 5bor/week to cover the whole REF


[03-Oct-21 04:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror If you do want to go into chemistry this is a good option and will help build experts with pretty low risk, i can focus on lab


[03-Oct-21 04:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000
there's a lot on CX


[03-Oct-21 04:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I expect slow fuel demand to go up


[03-Oct-21 04:08 PM] colerror#0000
I've actually got my 6 experts on phobos already, some how


[03-Oct-21 04:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I mean chemistry experts


[03-Oct-21 04:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Anyway, I'll bring 20 BOR from CX when I bring the AMM, and I can start production with GAL at first.


[03-Oct-21 04:25 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Unless somebody else is coming from CX before that.


[03-Oct-21 05:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alright ill look into building that. Im spending big on repairs this week but revenue is good


[04-Oct-21 06:04 PM] figaro0714#0000

[06-Oct-21 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 if you are desparate you could fly out to KI-401b and pick it up, but including fuel cost you would probably do better to buy it at market peice


[06-Oct-21 10:41 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape maybe i can get some Argon when im there too


[06-Oct-21 10:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
interesting. I could bring 60 to that same planet and buy hydrogen while im there


[08-Oct-21 12:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I will buy 600 MCG on behalf of insensless and megasaber and ship it to deimos


[08-Oct-21 12:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have the money now if you want to trade


[08-Oct-21 02:35 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I just came online. I can do 600@10k now that UR decided to dump MCG.


[08-Oct-21 02:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea sounds good


[08-Oct-21 02:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
PG prices also down, might interest you mark


[08-Oct-21 02:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah I could do with another thousand


[08-Oct-21 02:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

8@600?


[09-Oct-21 01:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I am still building a CHP + HB2 next on phobos. Delays everywhere as I re-arrange my plans and end up holding expensive materials


[09-Oct-21 01:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror Depending on how your finances are you might be able to beat me to a CHP right now.


[09-Oct-21 01:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think there is room for a few of these buildings between FLX, NS, and NAB demand which will have buyers on all of our occupied planets


[09-Oct-21 01:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
well. Mark wont want any of that on QJ but the NAB is related to the fuel at least


[09-Oct-21 01:53 PM] colerror#0000
Maybe. I'm sitting on 40k, and another 80 carbon so I could probably buy in now


[09-Oct-21 02:47 PM] colerror#0000
Anyone need C? working on scrapping as much funding together as I can to jumpstart CHP production

[12-Oct-21 12:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I am planning a flight out to BEN in about 6 days to get BOR and HAL


[12-Oct-21 12:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We will see if the HAL supply situation changes before then, but this should be the materials needed to start off a CHP. I will bring a full ship of TIO from KI-401b to drop on the IC1 market maker.


[12-Oct-21 12:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also Earthling will build another CHP on phobos but I think it will be primarily for vertical production.

 I will still build a CHP next and dedicate it to HAL + NAB


[13-Oct-21 01:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@colerror can you sell me 8 MAI, HCP or GRN? I forgot to stock up.


[13-Oct-21 02:24 PM] colerror#0000

produce into it and dump everything you can above 300


[17-Oct-21 10:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I really doubt that it can stay below 275 long term but it could go as low as 225-250

@figaro0714 We dont have TCL in corp


[20-Oct-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling has everything to build a LAB and HB3 right now but we are also very short on Chlorine which is needed for TCL, EPO, and DDT (which is what earthling wants to make).


[20-Oct-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am bringing the equivalent of 13 CL back from BEN right now


[20-Oct-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[21-Oct-21 05:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000

[22-Oct-21 04:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano do you still have the PPF?


[22-Oct-21 04:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think I can commission some PSLs for the corp again. Earthling is using the last batch that I bought to settle griffonstone


[22-Oct-21 04:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also @megasaberexe the shipping contract is ready to go when you arrive, and I can hook you up with some PG while you are here


[22-Oct-21 05:05 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have 4 ready currently, and another 8 within 4 days.


[22-Oct-21 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK. I know we have been doing 12PSL @18000 but if that doesnt keep with inflation we can talk about changing prices or cheaper PG


[22-Oct-21 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ill buy 24 whenever they are available


[22-Oct-21 05:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
24 is probably going to be 10 days from now, but I can take some of my offers off CX if an urgent need comes up.


[22-Oct-21 05:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
10 days is fine, there is no urgency


[22-Oct-21 05:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
From our first expansion push I remember everyone getting stuck on PSL production time so I want to keep materials for at least 1 core module on hand


[22-Oct-21 05:32 PM] spatial_piano#0000
at current prices i'd do 12@20-21k, or alternatively 1000+40PG each, but we'll have to see what the market is in 10 days.

@spatial_piano while you are here, can we make a contract for 24 PSL?


[25-Oct-21 12:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sure. Do you want 1 big batch or 2x12?


[25-Oct-21 12:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'll have 12 ready tomorrow


[25-Oct-21 12:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Yes. I was actually considering buying it


[25-Oct-21 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
6 KV is enough to build with RDE


[25-Oct-21 02:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
could be used for Figaro's PP4


[25-Oct-21 02:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think I'll take it


[25-Oct-21 02:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The price is high, so KV would be 11k/u even in corporation.


[25-Oct-21 03:03 PM] figaro0714#0000
@spatial_piano i can get u 22 BBH in 2 days


[25-Oct-21 03:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000

I'm not sure. let me check


[25-Oct-21 04:00 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Figaro already provided the BBH

@figaro0714 I'll have 3 KV ready in 2,5 days if you still need them. I can make another 3 in 2 days from that if anybody wants them.


[25-Oct-21 08:34 PM] figaro0714#0000
@spatial_piano I'll definitely take the 3 KV


[26-Oct-21 05:00 PM] figaro0714#0000

[27-Oct-21 12:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oof. Puns


[27-Oct-21 12:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
They are all yours! I suppose you are ready to build the fuel refinery?


[27-Oct-21 12:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, might as well start it right now. I have enough gal to run for 1,5 days.


[27-Oct-21 12:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Should we make the contract now?


[27-Oct-21 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sure


[27-Oct-21 12:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I havent considered prices for NAB. one minute while i poke around


[27-Oct-21 01:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I see the CX ask is at 75, should be pretty easy for me to undercut that


[27-Oct-21 01:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
cost me around 47 each to produce, but that is with expensive hydrogen. In the future I will be using cheaper H.


[27-Oct-21 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lets go for 62 each?


[27-Oct-21 01:03 PM] spatial_piano#0000
sounds good, but we could alternatively trade 80 NAB to 50 H


[27-Oct-21 01:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have just bought 500H üôÇ


[27-Oct-21 01:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok, I'll just put up the buy @62


[27-Oct-21 01:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Nice. I'll start up the SF production. I should be able to sell at around 8, but I'll have to check.


[27-Oct-21 01:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can probably go lower, but we'll see


[27-Oct-21 01:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is good progress. Prices will be prices, but at the end of the day it is good to have slow fuel available when we are all bouncing between local planets


[27-Oct-21 01:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'd say I can do 80% of CX Ask, which would be about 7.63 at this moment. If the CX price drops to 8 I'll have to start lowering the discount gradually, but I can keep this rate for now.


[27-Oct-21 01:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I also bought some HE3, but there's not that much of it and the margin is pretty small, so I can't really give more than 5% discount on FF.


[27-Oct-21 02:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will look into funding a corporate fuel reserve, im not sure how much would be useful. Probably just 2 fuel tanks worth of each


[27-Oct-21 02:03 PM] spatial_piano#0000

yeah, I'm ready


[29-Oct-21 12:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
those are my PT and EXO offers.


[29-Oct-21 12:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can do 18 each again for PG


[29-Oct-21 12:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

noo that's not it.


[29-Oct-21 12:45 PM] spatial_piano#0000

really I would have paid more, it was starting to block my polymer plants haha


[29-Oct-21 12:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Speaking of PT and EXO, I have a decent amount of EXO, but I'm out of AL and nearly out of STL.


[29-Oct-21 12:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im bringing 60 FE to phobos soon


[29-Oct-21 12:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will depart KI-401 in about 9 hours with that and some Hydrogen loaded up. Once the FE hits Phobos we can dump it on @figaro0714 to get some steel going. Im sure he would be happy to take a discount and use the leftover FE in a PP1


[29-Oct-21 12:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If not, I can get it to @insensless72 on Deimos instead and get the steel that way. Should work out to more PT in less than 7 days total


[29-Oct-21 03:05 PM] insensless72#0000
I can have 16 STL in a little over 2 days if you need it. I also have FE if youd prefer. Plenty of AL to spare


[30-Oct-21 03:03 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror I have some HAL on Phobos if you want to run some Sodium/Chlorine recipes

How much would you like for 'em DLR?


[30-Oct-21 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I paid 21k, you can have them at the same price assuming you are building a base in our general area. Where are you building?


[30-Oct-21 01:29 PM] federalquality#0000
Harmonia, unless I change plans, in the area for certain in any case


[30-Oct-21 02:31 PM] federalquality#0000

[31-Oct-21 04:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@federalquality I noticed you have some requests for MCG on the CX. I could sell that for you on Phobos or on CX if you prefer.


[31-Oct-21 04:48 PM] federalquality#0000
@spatial_piano Awesome, how much for 900? cx pickup works for me

@figaro0714 250 each work for you?


[31-Oct-21 04:53 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can sell MCG @15.2/u so 900 would be about 13700.


[31-Oct-21 04:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Cornucopix has a bid on 15.7, but if you want to lower your bid to 15.2 on CX, I have enough MCG for both bids


[31-Oct-21 05:00 PM] federalquality#0000
I assumed local ads existed still on the cx stations for things other than shipping, TIL. orders changed

Oh you are pretty much doing 15% off like I was, but BFABs are already near a bottom before your discount. I will go 17 each on PG

@federalquality @colerror is it 250 each for Carbon now?


[12-Nov-21 07:37 PM] colerror#0000
CX is currently at MM.


[12-Nov-21 07:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ouch. I will happily pay 250 in corp on phobos. I consider that very cheap.


[12-Nov-21 07:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Just 2-3 weeks ago I was paying over 400 each. ü§∑


[12-Nov-21 07:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can pay now in full if the price is around 250.

How is the CHP business?


[13-Nov-21 08:30 PM] colerror#0000
Not great. Not a lot of market for NS or FLX


[13-Nov-21 08:32 PM] colerror#0000
Might try making med kits


[13-Nov-21 08:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats tough. Medkits are good if you can get HER


[13-Nov-21 08:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
FLX should sell on Deimos, and NS on harmonia, if you end up stocking too much you could consider dumping on their local markets


[13-Nov-21 08:34 PM] colerror#0000
Might be an idea


[14-Nov-21 09:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

What will you build next on phobos? Also do you have any new buildings?


[21-Nov-21 03:56 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think I'll expand on refining. NAB-SF recipe is very slow, so I may be able to run 2 refineries. I might need to expand the AMM and H proiduction before that


[21-Nov-21 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 has a good amount of INS in the pipeline


[21-Nov-21 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@colerror Just 4? The ad is gonna cost nearly as much as the material. I can sell @15/u, but you might want to buy more at the same time.


[27-Nov-21 11:57 AM] colerror#0000
Yea, I can buy 100 or so if that's better

Are you still able to expand despite the carbon prices, etc.


[28-Nov-21 08:48 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, I'm vertically integrated, so cost isn't a huge deal. Just did some repairs so I'm bringing my reserves back up


[28-Nov-21 08:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Good. Have you given more thought to the second base?


[28-Nov-21 08:53 PM] colerror#0000
Haven't thought about it yet


[28-Nov-21 11:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

I need the DDT for FIM


[16-Dec-21 07:27 PM] insensless72#0000
well HER


[16-Dec-21 07:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is 70 HER for sale


[16-Dec-21 07:29 PM] insensless72#0000
Also the CL for EPO


[16-Dec-21 07:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
she can sell 66 CL and I can sell 30.


[16-Dec-21 07:56 PM] insensless72#0000
whats the total for the 30 DDT and 90 CL?


[16-Dec-21 07:56 PM] insensless72#0000
and 30 COF


[16-Dec-21 11:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
COF = 280 each
CL = 700 each
DDT = 1500 each


[16-Dec-21 11:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
280x300 + 700x90 + 1500x30 = 116,400 AIC


[16-Dec-21 11:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Insensless like Mr. Monopoly out here. BFAB baron


[16-Dec-21 11:36 PM] insensless72#0000
I try to invest it all in corp. Lmk when everything is together and we can do it all at once


[16-Dec-21 11:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its all ready now if you want to post buys


[16-Dec-21 11:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
actually we will sell. its easier that way


[16-Dec-21 11:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[16-Dec-21 11:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
awesome. Im using this for consumables ü§£


[16-Dec-21 11:45 PM] insensless72#0000
Do it, were both pushing into technicians


[16-Dec-21 11:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
excited for you to be producing EPO on Nike. Props for bankrolling our operations as usual


[16-Dec-21 11:46 PM] insensless72#0000
btw thats an opening someone could exploit


[16-Dec-21 11:46 PM] insensless72#0000
technician consumables


[16-Dec-21 11:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
true, we have a solid DDT supply now


[16-Dec-21 11:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we need an ORC to produce ALE


[16-Dec-21 11:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Once we get a PP4 online I think ORC on harmonia should be first priority, unless somebody in corp was yoloing into electronics


[16-Dec-21 11:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ORC seems most profitable


[16-Dec-21 11:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Either Earthing or I

both have harmonia bases


[16-Dec-21 11:49 PM] insensless72#0000
Tech on harmonia though üôÉ


[16-Dec-21 11:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea, but it is probably best to run it on settlers only


[16-Dec-21 11:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
70 settler, 10 tech. I think the expense is too high for the technicians on 1-2 orchards, unless you need them for something else on the same base


[16-Dec-21 11:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and of course on harmonia you would only have a handful of techs regardless


[16-Dec-21 11:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ORC is a weird building. But it would be a slam dunk to make beer and wine


[16-Dec-21 11:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
fermenter is easy in comparison, mostly an afterthought if you are prepared to build an ORC


[18-Dec-21 10:58 AM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape I have a ship on Phobos. Do you have any PG I can buy?


[18-Dec-21 10:59 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[18-Dec-21 11:04 AM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano Do you have some MCG I can buy while im here


[18-Dec-21 11:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have a bit over 1k MCG on Phoibos, and 875 on Nike.


[18-Dec-21 11:07 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Price is 15.75/u


[18-Dec-21 11:08 AM] insensless72#0000

[19-Dec-21 05:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I have a bit of a FRM excess on Phobos, pretty much a big pile of GRN. I am happy to use it as subsidy for our OOG brand carbon production.

I too have a GRN excess sadly


[19-Dec-21 06:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sackless_jack are you producing carbon on Deimos with no farms?


[19-Dec-21 06:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
As in buying plants to burn

@spatial_piano do you have FF and SF to sell on Phobos? Earthling will buy at your prices


[21-Dec-21 03:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
She will buy 1000 FF and 2000+ SF


[21-Dec-21 03:29 PM] spatial_piano#0000
She'll have to wait for the FF, but I can sell up to 5k SF @8.25 right now


[21-Dec-21 03:31 PM] spatial_piano#0000
FF would take 2 days I think and the price is 16


[21-Dec-21 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats fine, we will do contracts now

[23-Dec-21 07:25 PM] domicius#0000
Could I please buy 1k of that fuel?


[25-Dec-21 11:24 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I can get you 700 FF and up to 3k SF. The rest of FF I need for myself, but I can get more SF pretty soon.


[25-Dec-21 11:30 AM] spatial_piano#0000
FF is still 16, SF is 8.8


[25-Dec-21 11:36 AM] domicius#0000
I can afford 1k SF @ 8.8 and 500 FF


[25-Dec-21 11:37 AM] domicius#0000
I'll post the adverts

@figaro0714 @bitcoin_ape Earthling probably will need some if she's going for IY-206i. If she needs funds for the base I can loan some of the fabs. She can pay back with HE3.


[26-Dec-21 09:04 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Indeed. @figaro0714 we are interested in this INS. We have the capacity to buy it but need to make some other trades today and tomorrow

Hi - looking to buy STL on Phobos or ANT1, 10k AIC worth?


[30-Dec-21 09:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@domicius I dont think we have STL on Phobos. There is a tiny bit of vertical construction using iron and steel but not enough to sell excess


[30-Dec-21 09:56 PM] figaro0714#0000
I have a lil excess, i can sell 12 for 10k@domicius


[30-Dec-21 09:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I stand corrected üòÑ


[31-Dec-21 03:46 AM] domicius#0000
Sorry, i got really confused there. I meant SF, which goes into the STL tank... Apologies


[31-Dec-21 04:12 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have the SF. Let me check the price

{Reactions}
ü•≥ 

[31-Dec-21 04:19 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Market price is a bit high right now. How about 1150 SF@10k?


[31-Dec-21 04:41 AM] domicius#0000
Sure. Is it ok if I buy 2300 @ 20k? I have more funds now


[31-Dec-21 04:44 AM] domicius#0000
If it is, I've posted an ad: LMA ZV-307D/10511

@spatial_piano if you still have SF, I can take 2300 as well ?


[31-Dec-21 04:47 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Sure. that's basically what I have left on Phobos


[31-Dec-21 05:00 AM] dasefx1#0000

[31-Dec-21 05:12 AM] domicius#0000
How much FF can I get for 8k?


[31-Dec-21 05:18 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I don't have HE3 to produce more, and what is on CX is expensive, so I have to sell close to Market rate. I could get you 421@8k


[31-Dec-21 05:22 AM] domicius#0000
I understand. If its ok I'll hold onto cash until you've got more.


[31-Dec-21 05:37 AM] domicius#0000
Ive delivered, and paid for the SF

[01-Jan-22 10:59 AM] megasaberexe#0000
40 OVE, 40 EXO, 20 PT


[01-Jan-22 11:04 AM] spatial_piano#0000
40 OVE @2100 and 40 EXO @3800 I can do today. I'm a bit low on PT, but I can do 20 by tomorrow, or 10 now and 10 tomorrow.


[01-Jan-22 11:04 AM] spatial_piano#0000
PT is 20@4200


[01-Jan-22 11:06 AM] megasaberexe#0000
I'll just take the OVE, EXO and the 10 PT. I'll get the rest from other corps members so I don't cut too much into your production


[01-Jan-22 11:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok, 10@2100 then


[01-Jan-22 11:06 AM] megasaberexe#0000

PG inventory is low right now, but i could spare a few repair kits


[01-Jan-22 11:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i can do a small amount of PG, maybe 200-300


[01-Jan-22 11:15 AM] megasaberexe#0000
200 is all I need really

I'll will definitely keep that in mind


[01-Jan-22 11:20 AM] dasefx1#0000

@spatial_piano  Do you make SF? Need 800


[01-Jan-22 12:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000

[01-Jan-22 12:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have MCG tho


[01-Jan-22 12:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay I'll buy the MCG from you now and wait tomorrow for the SF, I also need to wait for Yaro reply.


[01-Jan-22 12:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
300 MCG is what I need


[01-Jan-22 12:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The price has plummeted it seems. I can do 13/u.


[01-Jan-22 12:38 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh really? So 13 x 300 = 3900. That is a great price, I'll take 300


[01-Jan-22 12:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Are you ready to pick up


[01-Jan-22 12:39 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[11-Jan-22 12:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano @figaro0714 we should explore some other options. ColErr is great but he doesnt have the scale to support all of us


[11-Jan-22 01:16 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape got anything in mind?


[11-Jan-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
A dedicated carbon base on Harmonia is a scalable solution


[11-Jan-22 01:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Another choice is INC + EXT on Nike, pure resource extraction base that imports GRN for burning


[11-Jan-22 01:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
by the numbers, harmonia is best, but the +10% from HQ on Nike and the high abundance of LST for extracting makes it viable


[11-Jan-22 02:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
From my experience best is to create bases for experts. For example deimos. One player sme, one alo, c, o, one grn and one construction. 5 experts make really good results


[11-Jan-22 02:01 PM] dasefx1#0000
And harmonia is nice for C, but I think better for food


[11-Jan-22 02:01 PM] dasefx1#0000
As C is heavy to transport


[11-Jan-22 02:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes, Harmonia is best for food, and carbon is viable on other planets. I still think it is high efficiency because you can get many INC to run from a single FRM + RIG on harmonia, makes for a good profit margin


[11-Jan-22 02:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is a good point about planning bases around experts


[11-Jan-22 02:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 what do you think about an EXT + INC base on nike with 5 resource experts and imported crops for burning?


[11-Jan-22 02:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
Advantage are experts, but problem is two heavy products


[11-Jan-22 02:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
When you had few bases is fine


[11-Jan-22 02:05 PM] dasefx1#0000
But with 6-8 it is headache


[11-Jan-22 02:06 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Problem with Nike is that it's already heavy on export tonnage because of LST.


[11-Jan-22 02:07 PM] dasefx1#0000
Exactly


[11-Jan-22 02:15 PM] colerror#0000
I could also go heavier into C on Phobos. Even just importing COF (and getting a couple buildings repaired) would bring me up to 30/day. I think I could get close to 50/day without buying more plots


[11-Jan-22 02:15 PM] colerror#0000
Might be worth looking for more Carbon farmers on Phobos too though


[11-Jan-22 02:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
What recipe are you using for carbon?


[11-Jan-22 02:23 PM] colerror#0000
HCP-GRN right now. I throw HCP-GRN-MAI in when I build up a surplus, but I'm not sure if I can make that recipe work to run all the time at a higher output


[11-Jan-22 02:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Full recipe is a lot faster, but using it means a much heavier focus on farming. I think you produce at twice the rate of the 4+2 recipe, but consume nearly at 3 times the rate.


[11-Jan-22 02:45 PM] dasefx1#0000
For me best balance between rig and frm is MAI


[12-Jan-22 07:32 AM] domicius#0000
Anyone have 20 GRN on Phobos?

Don't have anything on phobos unfortunally but deimos isn't far and i'l make a good deal for you


[28-Jan-22 08:31 AM] rune_242#0000
first ship wil be free in 23h


[28-Jan-22 08:31 AM] rune_242#0000
then il put AL in a warehouse on phobos


[28-Jan-22 08:36 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I appreciate the offer! But for now I'm just looking for a few AL quick (within 25 hours) to finish off this order and get some capital again. Let's see if anyone has some already stocked. I'll shoot you a message once I can buy in bulk though and we can work something out, this game is tough early on because you can't afford to buy large stockpiles of mats - you're just living order-to-order lol


[28-Jan-22 08:36 AM] rune_242#0000
I feel ya man


[28-Jan-22 08:36 AM] rune_242#0000
still only have one base


[28-Jan-22 08:40 AM] namthorn#0000
if you can make it to the CX I can loan you some AL, got 62 sat there atm


[28-Jan-22 09:26 AM] dasefx1#0000
@yjhasaday list 3, I will fill it. Only ping me


[28-Jan-22 09:28 AM] dasefx1#0000

Anyone selling DW on Phobos?


[28-Jan-22 04:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The answer to this question is usually "no"


[28-Jan-22 04:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is better now that selvatys does some large shipments from harmonia, but not that much better.

@figaro0714 I would like to buy 600+ INS this weekend. Do you have the inventory on Phobos?


[28-Jan-22 06:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
4400 PG for sale on Phobos, delivery in less than 8 hours.


[28-Jan-22 06:53 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I would love to take some but I can't afford too much - can I get 100?


[28-Jan-22 06:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
my price is 17 each. ill sell any amount.


[28-Jan-22 06:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
what do you use it for?


[28-Jan-22 06:56 PM] yjhasaday#0000
PWO and OVE


[28-Jan-22 06:56 PM] yjhasaday#0000
If I had more money I would take much more


[28-Jan-22 06:57 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I need to build some LSE for myself in the near future too but can't afford to invest in the mats just yet


[28-Jan-22 06:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Since you are starting out, and only going for small amounts, I will sell to you at 11 each this time which is pretty close to my break even price.


[28-Jan-22 06:58 PM] namthorn#0000
i'm trying to drive the price down by selling low-cost pg internally so should be better soon


[28-Jan-22 06:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
What price are you going for Namthorn? I wont fight against you, I have been doing the same.


[28-Jan-22 06:59 PM] namthorn#0000
16/u selling on nike, not selling pg on phobos as of yet as havent had a reason to go here


[28-Jan-22 07:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have sold or used about 95% of my PG internally


[28-Jan-22 07:00 PM] namthorn#0000
could go a smidge lower though


[28-Jan-22 07:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
are you producing it on griffonstone?


[28-Jan-22 07:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I realize you are not in our spreadsheet yet, i dont know where your production is


[28-Jan-22 07:01 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, focus atm is getting more pols up to increase supply


[28-Jan-22 07:01 PM] namthorn#0000
need an absolute ton of lses for HB3 and labs


[28-Jan-22 07:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Nice. You will be able to beat my price naturally on griffonstone due to the +25% bonus


[28-Jan-22 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is me on Phobos

[28-Jan-22 07:02 PM] namthorn#0000
yea it is nice, that production time for pols is so high


[28-Jan-22 07:02 PM] namthorn#0000
ok maybe not xD


[28-Jan-22 07:02 PM] namthorn#0000
might take me a while to equal that


[28-Jan-22 07:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it barely makes it off planet, though


[28-Jan-22 07:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is really good that you are bringing it to Nike, that will be very helpful for us


[28-Jan-22 07:03 PM] namthorn#0000
true, there's a lot of pre-existing plastics production there


[28-Jan-22 07:03 PM] namthorn#0000
yea that was my goal, reduce lfab cost on nike, because damn am i not wanting to pay 4k+ per lfab on the CX


[28-Jan-22 07:04 PM] namthorn#0000
and nike is a nice stop on the way to the CX from griffonstone


[28-Jan-22 07:04 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I appreciate the discount but how about we split it otherwise I'll feel bad! If I put a contract up for PG @ 14/u for 200 would that be good?


[28-Jan-22 07:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday that works for me


[28-Jan-22 07:04 PM] namthorn#0000
should be getting another 2-3 POLs up in the next week so hopefully i'll saturate the market soon


[28-Jan-22 07:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
really it doesnt hurt me though on small amounts.


[28-Jan-22 07:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
good luck with that.


[28-Jan-22 07:05 PM] namthorn#0000
xD ikr


[28-Jan-22 07:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im sure you will get the POLs up, but the market is insatiable


[28-Jan-22 07:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In the presence of PG, they will accumulate it and shift PP2 production from BFAB to LFAB


[28-Jan-22 07:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
happens every time i build another POL, very quickly


[28-Jan-22 07:06 PM] namthorn#0000
really i just want to get to the point where C shipping becomes my limiting factor


[28-Jan-22 07:08 PM] yjhasaday#0000
@bitcoin_ape Okay, ad is up! Thanks again - helps me so much! I'm going to grow so much faster with the corp than I was on my own. I can't wait until I can contribute back to you guys some how


[28-Jan-22 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you certainly will. There will be many opportunities for you to give back


[28-Jan-22 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the best way for new players to help is by shipping. Since you have one base, you can probably get by with half of a ship (meaning one ship part time)


[28-Jan-22 07:09 PM] namthorn#0000
ye, you're manufacturing right? there's always a need for OVE/PT/EXO/PWO at least


[28-Jan-22 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
everyone except the top 1% of players has 2 ships just like you, but many of them have multiple bases and very difficult shipping problems.


[28-Jan-22 07:10 PM] namthorn#0000
ad here and someone will guaranteed buy your consumables


[28-Jan-22 07:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is true, i buy these things üôÇ


[28-Jan-22 07:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
10 polymer plants means 100 pioneers and 250 settlers. I frequently buy these on standing LM offers


[28-Jan-22 07:12 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Good to know about the shipping funnel-effect. I will try to help out in the shipping channel whenever I can, my ships are often idle. Maybe I'll keep one down in the Nike/Diemos area for you guys. @namthorn is there somewhere to get steel? I'm happy to provide OVE/PT/EXO/PWO but steel is pricey-does anyone internal make it?


[28-Jan-22 07:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its not too hard to source steel.


[28-Jan-22 07:12 PM] namthorn#0000
Deimos is full of metallurgists


[28-Jan-22 07:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is expensive, but the profit margin on power tools is very high.


[28-Jan-22 07:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
definitely worth it, we could loan you 10 STL or something to get going.


[28-Jan-22 07:13 PM] namthorn#0000
can produce some, have 16 at aNT i could sell but it's a low volume metal so i'm not inclined to spam steel unless there's a need


[28-Jan-22 07:15 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Its okay, I'll just buy it. I think I can still offer PT at below market rates and cut a profit. Now that I know its sought after by the corp I will put higher priority on it for que


[28-Jan-22 07:15 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm doing a trip to CX tomorrow and I'll pick some up


[28-Jan-22 07:15 PM] namthorn#0000
if you're gonna buy it give us a shout, like i said I have 16 STL at the CX sitting in a sell order I can sell for a better price than the bid


[28-Jan-22 07:16 PM] namthorn#0000
it hasn't moved in a few weeks so really you'd be doing me a favour


[28-Jan-22 07:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this conversation made me realize I only have 1 PT left on phobos üò¶


[28-Jan-22 07:17 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have 7 PT on Phobos I could give you 5 to tie you over if need be? I only go through 0.1 per day


[28-Jan-22 07:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes actually that would be great


[28-Jan-22 07:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i use 1.7 per day


[28-Jan-22 07:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[28-Jan-22 07:19 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I can do 225/u if that works for you toss up a LM order


[28-Jan-22 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
posted already at 300 each


[28-Jan-22 07:20 PM] yjhasaday#0000
you're too kind lol


[28-Jan-22 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
appreciate it. im a fool for almost letting my polymer plants slow down


[28-Jan-22 07:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
were talking about a difference of 375 AIC on that trade. The opportunity cost of my polymer plants slowing down is 2 order of magnitude off of that.


[28-Jan-22 07:22 PM] yjhasaday#0000
@namthorn I'll take you up on that offer of Steel at CX, let me know your price and I'll put up a buy contract


[28-Jan-22 07:24 PM] namthorn#0000
can let them go at 650/u, pop an order in for however many you need


[28-Jan-22 07:25 PM] namthorn#0000
also payment due whenever you think you'll have the cash


[28-Jan-22 07:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on the CX it would be instant payment, yea?


[28-Jan-22 07:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe Namthorn is talking about shipping them home?


[28-Jan-22 07:27 PM] namthorn#0000
LM ad on the CX, i cant sell on the CX at that price or they'll be eaten by the bids


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think you can only do shipping contracts on the CX LM


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] yjhasaday#0000
ya unfortunately I can't post contract for buy or sell


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
unless it has changed


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] yjhasaday#0000
only shipping


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] namthorn#0000
ah right, keep looking at the CX then


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] namthorn#0000
i;ll post a sell


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] yjhasaday#0000
but I'll post the highest buy order in


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] yjhasaday#0000
then you can fill it?


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] namthorn#0000
how many you want?


[28-Jan-22 07:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
both of you add 1 cent to the highest standing order and it will auto fill


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] yjhasaday#0000
just like 6 to get started


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
ye buy highest order is like 750ish


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
thats more than i'm willing to sell them for


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
kk i'll post a sell for 6


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
ah feck


[28-Jan-22 07:29 PM] namthorn#0000
nvm


[28-Jan-22 07:30 PM] namthorn#0000
never tried to sell like that before xD


[28-Jan-22 07:30 PM] namthorn#0000
kk, we sell them at the min buy then


[28-Jan-22 07:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is hacky haha


[28-Jan-22 07:30 PM] namthorn#0000
only allows shpping at CX, rip


[28-Jan-22 07:30 PM] yjhasaday#0000
ya 750 is hella expensive, I think Ask orders were at 700 last time I bought, I might hold off on PT until next run, hopefully price comes down and I'll message you


[28-Jan-22 07:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
back in my day, steel was 950 each and we thought it was a fair price.


[28-Jan-22 07:31 PM] yjhasaday#0000
oh boy

"times have changed, old man"


[28-Jan-22 07:33 PM] namthorn#0000
hmm, tell ya what, if you're willing to take the shipping contract for them back to phobos that could work


[28-Jan-22 07:33 PM] namthorn#0000
you can accept shipping right?


[28-Jan-22 07:34 PM] yjhasaday#0000
sure! Set it up, but don't pay much! You guys have already been too kind to me


[28-Jan-22 07:34 PM] yjhasaday#0000
$1


[28-Jan-22 07:34 PM] namthorn#0000
ye, then i'll post a sell on phobos when we're both on

[28-Jan-22 07:37 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Thanks man! Also I remember from my first week I was posting in the help chat and you helped me (I maybe even multiple times) so I'm glad to run into you again in the corp - thanks for everything! I'll get you back one day üòé

are you producing ABH or ADE as well ?


[04-Feb-22 11:33 AM] figaro0714#0000
@dasefx1 i dont but i can make some ADE, how much do u need?


[04-Feb-22 11:35 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think I plan to expand UNI regularly, so my demand can be constant. For current one around 8 is needed, as I had some already on nike


[04-Feb-22 11:37 AM] dasefx1#0000
so best is if you check what UNI need, and I can buy. For now ASE and ATA should be fine, as I had rest ASE on the way. So now ADE and ABH needed. Than when it finish I plan to do next UNI üòâ


[04-Feb-22 11:42 AM] figaro0714#0000
I just need to get my hands on some KV and i can start making ADE. This might be a stupid question, how do i check what UNI needs?

@figaro0714 I have a WPL built on Phobos, I can make you KV but the recipe input materials are more expensive than KV price at ANT right now so maybe buying it might be best


[04-Feb-22 11:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
@figaro0714 go to phobos, than population infrastructure, than to university details


[04-Feb-22 11:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
and when you roll you will see upgrade section


[04-Feb-22 11:51 AM] dasefx1#0000
@yjhasaday yes you are right, my production cost is higher than CX price hehe üòÑ


[04-Feb-22 12:14 PM] figaro0714#0000
Thanks guys, I'll get started on the ADE but it'll be about 1.5 weeks before its ready.

Hi all, I'm doing a trip Phobos -> Deimos if anyone has anything they want shipped. Leaving in 3 hours. Also I might have some space coming back if you want something from Deimos -> Phobos let me know and I'll see if I can fit it!


[05-Feb-22 10:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday I have a lightweight shipment.

@spatial_piano 481 HE3 and 1400 FF arriving on Phobos in 32 hours


[05-Feb-22 01:38 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Nice. That means that FF is now officially on the Menu. What price for the HE3?


[05-Feb-22 01:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will need to ask Earthing when she gets back. give me a few hours on the HE3 price


[05-Feb-22 01:41 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Does she plan to keep some or sell on CX? I can process everything, but I have some space issues which might make it difficult.


[05-Feb-22 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I would guess 250-300 range, she would be happy to take these high prices on ANT with some of the helium


[05-Feb-22 01:47 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I was thinking 200, but 250 is fair.


[05-Feb-22 01:48 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Price for FF would be 20% off Ask, with a minimum of 9/u.


[05-Feb-22 02:34 PM] dasefx1#0000
HE3 I can buy some üôÇ

[05-Feb-22 04:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 @spatial_piano Earthling will split the HE3 evenly between you at 250 AIC each


[05-Feb-22 04:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or if you both prefer a different split, that is fine too


[05-Feb-22 05:52 PM] dasefx1#0000

1200 EPO in production on Phobos, the final batch will be ready in 3 days.


[05-Feb-22 11:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Phobos this means I am short on PG for about 3 days as I produce all of this EPO instead. Back to PG after this is done.

[06-Feb-22 10:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have some reserve to sell tomorrow, about 1200

@spatial_piano Earthling is looking to buy more AMM, up to 400 if possible


[07-Feb-22 11:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Phobos is preferred, but she can ship it too if needed


[08-Feb-22 05:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
400 is quite a lot. I have 743 AMM total over all my inventories and YJ14 is also asking for some. I'm currently getting ~45/day.


[08-Feb-22 05:08 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I consume 9/day currently myself. I can take it down temporarily by making FF instead, but That won't last for long


[08-Feb-22 11:31 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
200-300 would be great, dont need to put stress on you. What is the best way to buy some?


[08-Feb-22 03:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000
On phobos would be the easiet. I made a shipping deal with YJ so I can either sell 350 now or the full 400 once he has completed the trip (I think it will take at least 2 days)


[08-Feb-22 03:30 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Anyway the price is 100/u.


[08-Feb-22 03:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Maybe I should double up AMM again. I'd need 22 AEF, 600 INS, 4 BBH,~~ 34 BSE, and 1 BTA~~


[08-Feb-22 03:38 PM] dasefx1#0000
BSE and BTA you can list on phobos

@domicius this is great! Also an excellent opportunity to refine SI on phobos if you already have AL and smelting

FE + STL too. many possibilities once you take the efficiency hit and make the building here.

Mainly i need to smelt AL in order to smelt SI... But indeed, anything cam be smelted!

[24-Feb-22 11:36 AM] allocater#0000
Do we have PPF on Phobos or the neighboring manufacturing planet? Anybody fancy producing DCM? I would buy at 2000/u, 6 per day


[24-Feb-22 11:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
I had 16 on ant c, and still not enough for my electronics, and I buy regularly plastics from CX


[24-Feb-22 11:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
so I can't help


[24-Feb-22 11:55 AM] dasefx1#0000
@allocater PSM and DCM is easy to produce so I advice own PPF


[24-Feb-22 11:57 AM] allocater#0000
yeah might do that


[24-Feb-22 11:58 AM] dasefx1#0000
DCM production cost it is around 1300


[24-Feb-22 11:58 AM] dasefx1#0000
so you will achieve better profit on PHF


[24-Feb-22 12:27 PM] cazertanu#0000
I suppose it could do that. Biggest order I filled was 200 before this.


[24-Feb-22 01:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@allocater 6 DCM /day would need 4 PPFs at 100% efficiency since you need to produce the PSM as well. Even with PSMs ready you'd need 1 PPF running at 150% efficiency. I have 1 PPF on phobos and can start making DCM as soon as I get SFKs from somewhere, but the best I can do is 1,8/day.


[24-Feb-22 01:12 PM] dasefx1#0000
@cazertanu let me know price and I will list


[24-Feb-22 01:23 PM] allocater#0000
1.8/day sounds good, I don't have full capacity yet either, so will only scale up as DCM becomes available. Atm I am at 1.7/d usage. But it's not critical I have reserves and can also buy from Benton.


[24-Feb-22 01:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Do you know if anyone has SFKs on Phobos?


[24-Feb-22 01:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[24-Feb-22 02:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Oh that's nice. How many can you sell? I'd need about 15/day


[24-Feb-22 02:31 PM] dasefx1#0000

how much exactly is needed? I have it in production now, about 600 will be ready in 2.5 days


[26-Mar-22 08:21 PM] yjhasaday#0000
@colerror can you give us an exact number of how much OFF is needed? The recipe makes 50 OFF for every 20 EPO - I see a few planetary buildings that need it so maybe we aim for 500 or so?


[26-Mar-22 08:50 PM] colerror#0000
We go through 240 every 3 days, we currently have about 24 days worth in storage


[28-Mar-22 12:29 PM] colerror#0000
Ok, I now need at least 2 OFF üòÑ

I specifically need 2 traded to me

How about you put up an ad on Phobos LM for 1$ and I'll fill once they're ready. I bought enough EPO for 1 run of production which makes 50, so you might as well take all 50 üôÇ

dont let this block your other production, we have SI reserve now which will last a week or so

more is better in my opinion, I think we will be scaling up our consumption of SI in the next month or two

and rain is already trying to swipe all the supply on Phobos at 800 each


[30-Mar-22 02:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
Just curious, what do you manufacture out of SI?


[30-Mar-22 02:34 PM] namthorn#0000
it's a staple of electronics which go into stuff like ship parts


[30-Mar-22 02:53 PM] yang_mills#0000
I can do it on a more regular basis. But then we will have to convene on a gratification for me. Since a smelter producing SI does not produce something else. Usually I produce FE out of FEO+C+O+FLX.


[30-Mar-22 02:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We can talk more about it later and find a fair price per SI, im not trying to pressure you for free smelter time


[30-Mar-22 02:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[30-Mar-22 02:59 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. I can produce SI on Phobos with a 20 SI per week limit. Because I still need my FE production. For now I don't need LFABs, but I might need BFABs, in particular BSE. I will let you know. I plan to open a 4th base on Nike and I am amassing the prefabs for that.

Accepted one, I'll let other people have a chance, but I can fulfil another one by tomorrow otherwise


[31-Mar-22 02:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
Do you need more AL on Phobos? I can bring 20+ from Deimos at the beginning of the next week. It will be 280 AIC per unit.


[31-Mar-22 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sounds good to me


[31-Mar-22 02:40 PM] allocater#0000
I am also consuming 5 AL per day, so it's always welcome


[31-Mar-22 02:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you are not limited by cargo space, i can load you up fully with AL


[31-Mar-22 02:41 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. In two days I will build 2 new SME on Deimos, for a total of 4 SME. This will expand my AL production.


[31-Mar-22 02:58 PM] yang_mills#0000
Does the corp also need STL, you know, for ship construction? If yes, I can consider in the future opening steel production on Deimos.


[31-Mar-22 02:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We do require steel in general, for shipbuilding, construction, and manufacturing. we have never had a really solid steel supply, but of course it can normally be found on the market


[31-Mar-22 03:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am able to provide full shiploads of FE on KI-401b if you are willing to fly out and get it. Quite cheap i might add


[31-Mar-22 03:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you are going for FEO instead of FE, you should buy it locally in Antares II because shipping is bad


[31-Mar-22 03:01 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, Mumzhar sells FEO on the Antares II b LM.


[31-Mar-22 03:02 PM] yang_mills#0000
STL however is much more painful to transport. A full shipload contains only 63 units.


[31-Mar-22 03:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that is refined FE


[31-Mar-22 03:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but shipping the FEO is actually way worse


[31-Mar-22 03:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the value per shipload of FEO is often lower than the fuel cost to transport, unless you are in system and flying slow


[31-Mar-22 03:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
I mean STL is more painful to transport than AL.


[31-Mar-22 03:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ooooh. Yes AL is easy.


[31-Mar-22 03:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

What happens if some consumables are missing? One loses the whole bonus provided by the building? Part of the bonus? Is it a big deal?


[10-Apr-22 06:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
partial bonus


[10-Apr-22 06:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the planet does better if it is supplied, but the tax revenue is not enough to cover it all. We do what we can, and monitor the population reports to see if the cost/benefit is there to push harder on some buildings


[10-Apr-22 06:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also with unemployment, it is hard to get anywhere. we need production to justify population growth


[10-Apr-22 06:09 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes supplying 300 COF for the unis is very expensive.


[10-Apr-22 06:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for example if there are a bunch of engineers, 33% unemployment, and migration away (net loss on engineers) then it would be kind of futile to throw resources to counter that


[10-Apr-22 06:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the loss of workforce in this case is a response to the lack of jobs


[10-Apr-22 06:11 PM] yang_mills#0000
Since @colerror is the governor of Phobos, perhaps he should post on the channel what are the upkeep priorities on Phobos.


[10-Apr-22 06:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He has not been very responsive, which is why I will take over governorship on phobos next cycle


[10-Apr-22 06:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
Oh, I see.


[10-Apr-22 06:15 PM] yang_mills#0000
Phobos is a difficult planet to manage. High tier pops and COCG bonus for advanced production, and at the same time a starting planet with many bases employing only PIOs, such as mine.


[10-Apr-22 06:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea really we need to run the festivities or family support program to increase low tier worker happiness


[10-Apr-22 06:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@bitcoin_ape We should prepare to a massive increase of PIOs on Phobos after the release on Steam. Perhaps we would soon need to upgrade the SST and INF to meet the needs. The upkeep will increase then. Also the upkeep of the COGC will increase.


[19-Apr-22 01:48 PM] yang_mills#0000
+10-15 bases on Phobos since the last week already.


[19-Apr-22 02:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Good point.


[19-Apr-22 02:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the nature of this game is that most new players quit within a week.


[19-Apr-22 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but even 10 permanent new bases on pioneers only could require infrastructure upgrades. I think we should be seen upgrading at least one POPI and upping our contributions in light of this.


[19-Apr-22 02:47 PM] namthorn#0000
employment before last popr was 39.2% for pios. i dont think you can stop some bleeding of pios with that high an unemployment level.


[19-Apr-22 02:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
sure


[19-Apr-22 02:54 PM] namthorn#0000
i agree being mindful of the upkeep cost of the cogc going up is a good shout but im not sure committing to upgrade a building is a good idea with the unemployment malus effectively capping the happiness


[19-Apr-22 02:59 PM] yang_mills#0000
The problem is that a lower safety and health because of the increase in PIOs will lower the happiness of all the other pops, not just PIOs. Because need fulfilment is calculated globally, not by population tier.


[19-Apr-22 03:01 PM] yang_mills#0000
So an explosion on PIOs without a corresponding increase in infrastructure will decrease the happiness of SETs, TECs, ENGs and SCIs.


[19-Apr-22 03:01 PM] namthorn#0000
true, 80% is very good though imo.


[19-Apr-22 03:02 PM] namthorn#0000
for perspective, deimos is at 46% and 60% for safety/health respectively, still a good stock of pio/set/tec


[19-Apr-22 03:02 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok.


[19-Apr-22 03:03 PM] namthorn#0000
should revisit this tomorrow though when we have more recent popr data


[19-Apr-22 03:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the risk is that we have a sudden inversion of unemployment numbers when a bunch of new players come in


[19-Apr-22 03:03 PM] allocater#0000
I heard that upgrading is better than supplying because it is permanent and reduces the running costs of supplying


[19-Apr-22 03:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
With higher level upgrades you can choose to supply cheaper mats only.


[19-Apr-22 03:06 PM] namthorn#0000
if we plan for anything - INF imo is the better one to go for, about half the bfabs compared to a 7th SST


[19-Apr-22 03:07 PM] namthorn#0000
and more weighting for higher pop tier happiness


[19-Apr-22 03:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
Having building B at level 1 supplied with materials M1, M2 and M3 has the same effect as the building B at level 3 supplied only with M1 (x3 as much). If it happens that M1 is cheaper than M2 and M3, then is is better to upgrade. Saves upkeep cost for the same effect.


[19-Apr-22 03:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
Agree.


[19-Apr-22 03:09 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also part of the safety comes from the number of bases that will increase.


[19-Apr-22 03:09 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, CM can support 200ish pioneers on their own iirc


[19-Apr-22 03:12 PM] namthorn#0000

@Phobos A bad population report for Phobos today. The planet keeps loosing ENG and SCI. Their numbers a lower than the number of jobs. Low comfort and education levels, both 33,8%. Actually the education level as such is higher than this, but it has been capped by the lower level of comfort. So we have to put more effort into upkeeping the Art Gallery. Where is the project of producing UTS for the upkeep?


[20-Apr-22 09:01 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have recently bought PFE and SOI to maintain the wildife park. UTS would be nice.


[20-Apr-22 09:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
@allocater said he could produce UTS. @insensless72 said he could produce UTS, but later.


[20-Apr-22 09:09 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea, they both have FS for ship building. I will pay fairly for any/all UTS


[20-Apr-22 09:09 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
build first and ask questions pater üôÇ


[20-Apr-22 11:35 AM] allocater#0000
ok I am trying to buy more FEO/FE and slot UTS

@Phobos Please, someone, complete the upkeep of the COGC on Phobos with DW. 4 days left. We need 197 DW. I don't have it.


[20-Apr-22 05:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
And the SST is also running low on DW.


[20-Apr-22 05:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

INF is Ok, stocks for 13+ days.


[20-Apr-22 05:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
PAR would need PFE or FOD or both. I have 60 PFE on the CX and will bring it soon.


[20-Apr-22 05:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
ART needs MHP or UTS or both.


[20-Apr-22 05:09 PM] yang_mills#0000
LIB? Do we care about it?


[20-Apr-22 05:10 PM] yang_mills#0000
UNI needs upkeep. Reserves running low. I will bring 60 TUB in 2 days, but this is not enough.


[20-Apr-22 07:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have SOI, PFE, MHP and HOG

@bitcoin_ape I've seen your ads for PT on Phobos. I could fill one. But don't you overpay for it? You can have it at almost the same price on the CX.

[26-Apr-22 11:10 AM] yang_mills#0000
Last dividend payment was 11,29 AIC per share, and there are 18K shares in total. So the total payment was 203220 AIC. That's tax revenues from Phobos + Nike. It's not even enough to cover the COGC on Phobos.


[26-Apr-22 11:11 AM] yang_mills#0000
Not even taking into account the POPI.


[26-Apr-22 11:57 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats before the rush, though. Our pioneer base will likely triple


[26-Apr-22 11:58 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Negative cash flow is not an issue unless it extends for 2 months from today. This will also be a good data point to justify the tax raise further


[26-Apr-22 12:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we have been making 11-12k consistently. I expect when the new player tax revenue comes in next week, we will have 40-50% increase which will at least cover cogc

How does donating work? Is there an explanation somewhere?


[08-Jun-22 04:12 AM] namthorn#0000
donating resources? you just go into the popi menu, choose the building you want to contribute to and assign resources accordingly. They get taken every X days (varies based on resource). You get the a % of the corresponding yield of the building each popr based on how well it was stocked during the week (e.g. safety from SST) that then feeds into the happiness calculations during popr.


[08-Jun-22 04:12 AM] namthorn#0000
yang has been coordinating the phobos effort and from the looks of things, has kept the planet well stocked.


[08-Jun-22 06:46 AM] insensless72#0000
This is what it looks like when you get into POPI Domicius. You can assign items much like you would if you were upgrading your HQ

yes, the more we contribute the more safety/comfort/ etc we get

If theyre not stocked they do not get consumed but we dont get 100% of the effect


[08-Jun-22 08:36 AM] insensless72#0000
We can combine them with programs to boost certain things like happiness and education. not every item is necessary though, especially if theyre hyper inflated

I make it, but also buy it - because I have focused on BRM. I make a killing on the smelting either way. How much do you need?

If you're making a killing, I can just keep buying on the CX; my excess couple CU a day have been plenty profitable even with that sourcing.  Been thinking a bit about settling a base over there myself, but doubt the corp needs that much more BRM and I'm probably our only copper user.  Don't want to crowd your business

[18-Jun-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
more is better. These are for the phobos library

it pumps up our education numbers, more engineers, etc.

maybe 2 per week? is that difficult?

even 1 per week is good


[18-Jun-22 11:27 AM] domicius#0000
That number is not difficult. Making 7 per week or moee would require a new SL, which can be done

[14-Jul-22 02:49 PM] yjhasaday#0000
lol I haven't been able to sell a single unit of H on the CX yet - between my own demand and our corp's low H production it disappears pretty fast! I have bfabs for another 4 COLs on its way out but another supply of H would be nice. When I messaged here saying I had 300 H on Phobos I certainly didn't expect to have to supply an additional 3500 H (on QJ-382g) in response! üòÖ  ...plus I have my new ship on its way out and I'm hoping to fill it with at least 1500+ H, we'll see whats left lol

[28-Jul-22 01:21 PM] churavis#0000
They know there are people that play within the same household, so they probably look at things that indicate device identity.

Hi @Phobos, any volunteers for the governorship? If anyone is interested please reply to this message. If you currently hold another governorship we can have another OOG member take over. This might be the best option to move forward because Phobos is not an easy planet for someone without governing experience. 

We will cover any necessary expenses so really the only thing we're asking for is your time and attention üôÇ


[11-Aug-22 11:24 AM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday If you are willing to take the governorship on Phobos, then I could replace you on Nike. However, I can tell that governing Phobos is very demanding because there are many different consumables to provide: DW, RAT, MCG, PE, OFF, SUN, TUB, FOD, SOI, PFE, MHP, HOG, UTS, etc. There role of a governor would be to find the suppliers inside or outside our corp, to create long term contracts, to survey the stocks of supplies, to ping the suppliers if they don't deliver on time, etc. And also to keep the books and try not to let the expenses go through the roof. So we (the corporation) can provide the necessary funds, but we need a volunteer who is willing to invest the necessary time.


[11-Aug-22 11:26 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Ya, I thought about it. But I like my post on Nike. Let's see if anyone else is interested. How disappointed would we be if we conceded the planet? We could post on UFO before the next election to ask someone else to run. I'm sure many of us would still help out with upkeep since we have important bases on planet


[11-Aug-22 11:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
Personally, I would be very happy if Man of the Sea (Sea of Dirac) returns. He did it for a long time and he did it well.


[11-Aug-22 11:29 AM] yang_mills#0000
I think we spend more in upkeep from Phobos than we get from taxes.


[11-Aug-22 11:29 AM] churavis#0000
We make a lot of money from our high tier production lines there

We can consider raising taxes if necessary


[11-Aug-22 11:31 AM] yang_mills#0000
That's why we need a competent governor. But it does not need to be an OOG member. Sea of Dirac is very competent.


[11-Aug-22 11:32 AM] churavis#0000
I'd rather keep it in the corp and I'm willing to be governor next election when I have a well established electronics base there.


[11-Aug-22 11:34 AM] churavis#0000
Yes, I don't see any reason not to

Guys, Phobos is losing scientists. With DLR gone, is there anyone who wants to take over management, or do we open it up to other corps?


[17-Aug-22 09:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think its time we open it up to other corps - we've been asking around for over a week for a volunteer to take over Phobos governorship and I'm not aware of anyone who was interested üò¶


[17-Aug-22 09:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
Phobos should be one of the most difficult planets to manage in this game.


[17-Aug-22 09:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
Do we manage Phobos for profit or the reputation of Corp, or just for fun?


[17-Aug-22 09:47 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Reputation/fun. We‚Äôve got most of the planets in the region, so it‚Äôs sad to lose the jewel


[17-Aug-22 09:50 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I think losing our crown jewel will mean quite a hit to our dividend but I think its more important that we don't force someone to it and burn them out. We'll still have plenty of income from the half dozen other OOG planets


[17-Aug-22 09:51 AM] jackinabox86#0000
We have the rest of this term and @churavis agreed, I believe, to manage it in zDLR‚Äôs absence. We should wait a couple weeks maybe before making the decision? Can let other corps know before the 7 day election starts


[17-Aug-22 09:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
The manager of Phobos should be helped in some ways to reduce his workload.


[17-Aug-22 09:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe it's a good idea to share the supply tasks required by Phobos to everyone, so that the manager only needs to be responsible for receiving and using them in Phobos.


[17-Aug-22 09:56 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I would like to say something about our plan publicly as soon as possible though, the rumblings of discontent have already been happening. If OOG is going to retain Phobos governorship we should message UFO or the in game channel to notify people that we will catch up with upkeep and install a new governor that will oversee infrastructure


[17-Aug-22 09:58 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yes, that's already how we do it. The governor is only responsible for keeping an eye on things and organizing fees/programs. We collectively contribute to upkeep


[17-Aug-22 09:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there is a suitable and trustworthy candidate, you can even recruit a manager from outside the Corp


[17-Aug-22 10:01 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Fair enough. I‚Äôm on vacation and haven‚Äôt been watching UFO.


[17-Aug-22 10:03 AM] dersix#0000
I have a very high interest in Phobos as it's the core of my income. @churavis , please let me know your plans, in case necessary I'll drop Griff and Switch to Phobos (even though that will start an interesting discussion on Griff :) )


[17-Aug-22 10:09 AM] churavis#0000
My next base will be on Phobos and my plans are to drop the Harmonia Governorship and take up Phobos. I am in the process of orienting my industry towards upkeep items and arranging for what I can't make.


[17-Aug-22 10:09 AM] churavis#0000
If we need a program for the short term, let me know


[17-Aug-22 10:42 AM] dersix#0000
People start realizing the inconsistency  of zDLR, on one hand new base on hep and on the other hand apparent inactivity on phobos. I would strongly suggest to lower/stop the usage of that account sooner than later...


[17-Aug-22 11:29 AM] domicius#0000
DLR's governorship elapses in 4 days, so there's not a lot of time. Getting and organising the contributions and planning updates is a fairly major job. I know it's a prestige thing, but also we're losing pop quite badly, and it needs to be reverted, as this is affecting everyone at the higher tech levels of production!


[17-Aug-22 12:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have a Phobos base, so I haven't looked until now. Those numbers are fairly dire, and with the way happiness works- they won't correct themselves immediately anyway. I think if we don't have a volunteer in 24 hours who is willing to run, we should issue a statement, so we can wash our hands of the consequences at least a bit


[17-Aug-22 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really know what the phobos specific income is, but overall upkeep costs look quite high


[17-Aug-22 12:30 PM] churavis#0000
We can run a program in the short term while we arrange for upkeep and give it time to raise fundamentals


[17-Aug-22 12:32 PM] allocater#0000
no planet pays for itself, they are all charity endeavors as far as I understand


[17-Aug-22 12:38 PM] dersix#0000

[17-Aug-22 03:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000

[17-Aug-22 03:35 PM] archielvahr#0000

[17-Aug-22 05:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
@churavis what do you need from us for Festivities III?


[17-Aug-22 05:56 PM] churavis#0000
zDLR has initiated Festivities III but it was expensive so buy H2O, LST, ALO, PG or HAL from him


[17-Aug-22 06:18 PM] exeler#0000
The way I play this game lends itself towards producing larger quantities of the same stuff rather than managing a base full of different shops that switch orders and inputs frequently to craft items on demand. 

I wouldn't mind focusing my next few bases on making planet maintenance inputs in bulk since the demand for them is pretty consistent.


[18-Aug-22 03:46 PM] domicius#0000

[01-Sep-22 12:59 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Have you considered making a Heph base to make PE first? I think we have the means to supply the H now that the corp has multiple H bases. Also the INC planets should start pumping out C soon too - we will be making all the PE!


[01-Sep-22 01:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's an interesting thought. Seems like PE is always needed. I don't have spare crops for C production myself. Maybe I could buy all my C. Yeah I'll have to think about that. I've also considered an SME base too, perhaps for TI production

Maybe we can do this with phobos. 1. Invest more SE , so that Corp can get enough benefits there. 2. The governor places purchase orders with internal members of Corp to avoid maintaining phobos alone. 3.according to the maintenance cost adjustment tax to keep balance. 4.by the Corp to make up the governor's losses.

should we make ENG 100% happy and tax them 1440?

on the one hand, it's a lot of work and EDC bases will exploit it

on the other hand we can build EDC bases ourselves on phobos to get some of the work payed back.


[20-Feb-23 02:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
No government program running atm. Toss a festival 3 in there and that will increase the education rate a fair bit (honestly I think more than the various "education programs", although I haven't run the math on it. 100% is a high bar to aim for. really only need a bit more to close that employment gap.

yeah, on high end planets it's just education or festivals, depending if you need high or low level pops.

A1A's infrastructure has been built, and the governor will be ours. If someone has invested two or more permit in phobos, consider moving SD, CLR and ELP to A1A.

After my three APFs are filled with ENG, I can occasionally sell some APF products, such as LIS, FFC and RCS.


[01-Apr-23 09:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have 12 SD, and the software produced is just enough.


[02-Apr-23 02:16 AM] domicius#0000
If you're making all that, how come you're buying s/w from me?


[02-Apr-23 04:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
Because I want to reduce the frequency of transportation


[02-Apr-23 04:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
If I have more than 15 days' inventory, it will be easier for me.


[02-Apr-23 04:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
What I'm doing now is to strike a balance, but unless I ship it once every 2-3 days, the production will stop.üòÑ


[02-Apr-23 08:50 AM] domicius#0000
That's a bit bizarre


[02-Apr-23 08:51 AM] domicius#0000
But ok. Do I have to scale for you and @allocater , or will your prod eventually catch up?


[02-Apr-23 08:53 AM] allocater#0000
seems it's just a one-time buy, so no scaling needed


[02-Apr-23 09:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
My production capacity has already caught up, so you don't need to expand. I just want to buy 15-30 days' inventory to make my transportation easier.


[02-Apr-23 09:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
Specifically, if my heph base has a five-day inventory of WAi, and the amount of WAI produced by my phobos base is the same as that consumed by heph, I need to transport it at least once every five days. If I buy a 30-day inventory from you, I only need to ship it once every 30 days.

Made a base on Phobos. Does it make sense to add SCA here?


[09-Apr-24 04:46 PM] churavis#0000
The SCA market is quite saturated, both in and outside the corp


[09-Apr-24 04:57 PM] mrsmith33#0000
it will be only for my own consumption


[09-Apr-24 04:57 PM] churavis#0000
How much SCN do you use?


[09-Apr-24 04:58 PM] mrsmith33#0000
2/d


[09-Apr-24 04:59 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Though I'm talking about SCA building


[09-Apr-24 05:00 PM] churavis#0000
That's a manufacturing building, why would you build it on Phobos? There are lots of manufacturing planets nearby.


[09-Apr-24 05:01 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Because I can fit 1 in, and I have some time until I get to the next permit to build a manufacturing base


[09-Apr-24 05:01 PM] mrsmith33#0000
However I have some space on Heph


[09-Apr-24 05:02 PM] churavis#0000

[09-Apr-24 07:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I used to have my small and medium component parts (and my AFP) on Phobos and it saved a ton of shipping. For a while I had a dedicated puddle jumper to move things between Phobos and Heph because I had to move so much back and forth to keep them busy


[02-Jul-24 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000

tbh, I'm not sure I totally get the appeal from the other side from him. I sort of feel like your permits are the most limited resource there is for a player.


[06-Jul-24 03:14 PM] akyantor#0000
So you give one of those up... and you create a dependance on another person which probably creates burnout eventually as you feel a bit trapped.


[06-Jul-24 03:14 PM] akyantor#0000
But maybe that's just me


[06-Jul-24 03:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
He's got money - he funds the bases and stuff, and that's a big obstacle esp. for early players


[06-Jul-24 03:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
and then like you said, dependency and burnout


[06-Jul-24 03:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
i mean, I don't begrudge anyone their choice to rent a permit out to anyone. I just think it sounds like a better deal than it actually is early on when cash is your limiting factor


[06-Jul-24 03:16 PM] akyantor#0000
No, clearly a personal choice


[06-Jul-24 03:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
imo that's what the CX _should_ be for. outsource to the market the things that you don't have the permits to make yourself

[06-Jul-24 03:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
more POPI stuff on the CX isn't a bad thing. Just mentioned this here because there was discussion in the Phobos chat about if/how Rise would be able to supply some of those POPI materials in the long-term

and i mean, there's a parliment system now, i would imagine supplying popi would fall under every member of the parliament, and not just the governor

otherwise why bother with the parliment members, fuck them off and just have one person run it


[06-Jul-24 03:36 PM] akyantor#0000
Agreed. It wouldn't be a bad thing for some of those less liquid supplies to be more plentiful, and as a result cheaper.


[06-Jul-24 03:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
i would hope so, but I don't think we've had long enough with the new system to see how it'll turn out yet


[06-Jul-24 03:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
i know Archiel has been working on a sheet to price goods relative to the upkeep they provide. I think it'll be a lot easier to coordinate multiple people once tools like that are available


[06-Jul-24 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
well i'm seeing a lot of planets that have OOG and Rise, along with the overtaking of Phobos, so it would be my expectation that both sides would contribute to the popi, so im a bit confused on why we are worrying about Rise being able to supply popi to all the planets when, y'know, oog has seats on those parliament should anything fall short.


[06-Jul-24 03:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
I wasn't a part of the discussion on Phobos, I don't have a base there. I just saw some discussion in the chats about how he would be able to supply some of the more rare POPI materials and figured that was the answer

[06-Jul-24 03:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm personally not super worried about who'll be able to supply what. That's what the invisible hand of the free market is for üòõ


[06-Jul-24 03:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
But I do think there are currently a lot of conflicting opinions on what the division of labor between govs and PMs should be. And I have thoughts on what it _should_ be, but I don't think we'll know what it _will_ be until we've had a few weeks to work with this new system


[06-Jul-24 03:50 PM] akyantor#0000
I think it'll be particularly challenging when you've got planets where there will be 5 MPs. 2s, or 3s, will probably still be quite governer led (if I were to guess), but 5 will require more co-ordination/alignment on the approach.


[06-Jul-24 03:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
like Phobos üòÑ


[06-Jul-24 04:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @Deleted User , you want a corp invite in-game? Did you get one yet?


[06-Jul-24 04:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Supplying the stuff isn't really the concern, its' getting everyone to remember to open all their buffers once a week and click through them. Then if someone forgets, can someone cover for them / remind them or are they gonna be super antagonistic about it. The governor stuff isn't something you gotta check every day, just frequently enough that it's a thing that can be forgotten. Like voting for the COGC ü§î


[06-Jul-24 04:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's kinda what I meant by division of labor - i.e. should MPs and Govs share equally in the upkeep costs? Is the gov expected to do all of it as before? Are the MPs just there as backup? I think we all have an idea of the system we want, but it remains to be seen how it'll settle out


[06-Jul-24 04:08 PM] akyantor#0000
I suspect the complexity will be that there will be variation from planet to planet


[06-Jul-24 04:08 PM] akyantor#0000
And the conventions may end up changing each time there's a change in the makeup of the MPs.


[06-Jul-24 04:09 PM] akyantor#0000
We don't know how stable the MP groups will be yet


[06-Jul-24 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
And I think that's part of the reason why there's so much skepticism about Rise from some folks here -  he's publicly stated that on a bunch of planets, he's only planning on providing advice / helping out. Which is totally fine imo, nothing wrong with that. He clearly knows how to govern planets. But on planets like Phobos where he's gunning for gov, does that mean he'll be doing the lion's share of the upkeep and expecting the others on the parliament to give advice / occasional help? And then you have to ask that question for every planet he's running on, which is a lot. There's gonna be a ton of MOTS to deal with and a lot of individual discussions on each planet. I think if you took the time any given person spends on Prun in a day and divide it between enough planets, it's valid to wonder at which point any individual planet will get the time / attention it needs. But at the end of the day, no one can answer that question right now - we just need to wait and see how things go.


[06-Jul-24 04:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
Don't get me wrong, Rise clearly cares a lot about the game, and I have no doubts that he's operating in good faith. I think at the end of the day, all of us want the same thing - planets running smoothly with reasonable taxes. It's just that different people have different opinions on how the division of labor should be in the planetary governments and we've got just over 2 weeks of data on how it's actually working in practice üòÑ

[06-Jul-24 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
at least, those are my thoughts from lurking in planet chats


[06-Jul-24 05:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you've got a planet with 5 MPs on it, and something doesn't get filled then everyone can say "I thought someone else was gonna do it". So then there's a bunch of meetings among the MPs and maybe it ends up being a lot more work than just having one person do it? Especially if people are gonna fight you on the decisions. Or make you justify why you chose to put PFI in the park instead of OLF. So far I haven't seen any discussion on any of my planets, they've all been smaller though, and the one governor can just handle them


[06-Jul-24 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
i think the idea was, hey, let us govern more than one planet officially


[06-Jul-24 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[07-Jul-24 02:34 AM] exeler#0000
I think the multiple MPs system was so that people like Rise who want to govern 20 planets don't get to crowd out the entire playerbase from participating in government. With one governor and only being able to hold one spot, there were plenty of positions available to anyone who cared to participate in that system.

[16-Jul-24 12:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
I would recommend doing CX prices generally, but if someone is doing prices like this, it's essentially a big donation.


[16-Jul-24 12:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
pumping up building levels isn't a bad idea in general though


[18-Jul-24 05:49 AM] domicius#0000
So how does it work? If you build up the infrastructure your consumables go down?


[18-Jul-24 05:54 AM] melon164#0000
The contribution to happiness scales linearly with the infrastructure level, and scales down with how many of the materials you provide.  So a level 1 SST supplied with DW, OFF and SUN provides the same safety as a level 3 SST supplied only with DW.  But if DW is much cheaper than the others, your overall cost to maintain safety is lower.

Hello Phobos! 

I hope this survey finds you well. To the point! 

Phobos currently generates 12mil a month in income, and uses about 2mil a month in POPI upkeep. (When I originally did the math, I thought it was per week, because there is no way it would be that cheap... nope. 2mil a month). This is because this planet has a massive ENG/SCI pop...

1 more vote needed for Scorpy @Phobos


[30-Oct-24 01:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
ROGUE_HX wasn't running, now he's running again. It's sort of weird. Rise really really wants the same exact parliament as last time and is pushing hard for it. I think he is really nervous about Nano running


[30-Oct-24 01:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
To be clear, no one but Rise is doing anything on Phobos, so it's a bit of a mystery


[30-Oct-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
but everyone seems confused where xepiov is getting votes


[30-Oct-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
since he is also getting votes on Heph


[30-Oct-24 01:54 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm not surprised. He probably doesn't love the idea of two OOG members who could swing votes, not that there's any particular intention to do that.


[30-Oct-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I told him that, and I don't think he believes me.


[30-Oct-24 01:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
and I still think xepiov has never said anything in any discord or in-game chat... so where these votes are coming from is a total mystery to everyone


[30-Oct-24 01:55 PM] katinga#0000
He's on Romulus, too, now


[30-Oct-24 01:55 PM] katinga#0000
I used to think he was a Rise puppet but I'm not so sure now


[30-Oct-24 01:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which is mostly interesting because it makes it seem like there's a small but secret organization here.


[30-Oct-24 01:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
He's not in AA, at least not right now.

[30-Oct-24 01:58 PM] katinga#0000
He hit run again immediately after the last election was over


[30-Oct-24 01:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, he seems to do that everywhere


[30-Oct-24 01:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
He's not on any of the sponsored base lists for AA


[30-Oct-24 02:00 PM] katinga#0000
no I don't think he's on that server


[30-Oct-24 02:13 PM] akyantor#0000
Are they non-english speaking player maybe? Getting votes from folks on a server for that language. That's the only reason I can think of that they're completely unresponsive and still getting a non-trivial number of votes.


[30-Oct-24 02:15 PM] katinga#0000
or it's a bot


[30-Oct-24 02:21 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Does anyone happen to have some OVE/COF/PWO on phobos? I made a resupply mistake.


[30-Oct-24 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah we think he is Greek


[30-Oct-24 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just from the name.


[30-Oct-24 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don‚Äôt know of a language specific channel though

It‚Äôs hard to not vote for nanoengineer if it‚Äôs making Rise nervous though üòÑ


[30-Oct-24 02:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
Like you said, not like we‚Äôre planning to change anything. But it seems (anecdotally) like he‚Äôs been slipping up on some of the larger planets more often recently, so maybe he thinks we‚Äôre going to try and oust him? Idk


[30-Oct-24 02:50 PM] akyantor#0000
You mean like missing the recent COGC upkeep on Phobos. üòõ

[30-Oct-24 02:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, or the ENG/SCI shortages on Heph. I seem to remember that govs have been run off of similar planets for similar situations


[30-Oct-24 02:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not that I‚Äôm suggesting we should do that. I‚Äôm actually fine with things as they are, and govs are allowed to make mistakes.

It would appear there's a bit of a double standard.


[30-Oct-24 02:55 PM] akyantor#0000
I find it curious that he tries to put the blame at folks for not communicating with him, but simultaneously expecting folks to pay for programmes to increase immigration for SCI/ENG. He sort of encourages a lack of communication... in my view these things should be funded from plantary taxation... particularly on massive planets where frankly it's easy to maintain a big surplus. *This to ensure that the burden for generating the necessary population is shared fairly.*


[30-Oct-24 02:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I think it‚Äôs purely deflecting blame on his part. A heads up is definitely a courtesy, but it‚Äôs weird to expect people to fund programs out of their own pockets


[30-Oct-24 02:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Speaking of which, I should check to see if he is actually running any programs or not


[30-Oct-24 03:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's a double standard, but I guess Rise has been doing good enough and supplying things under cost so I don't want to rock that boat too much. He has been online a lot less the last couple months


[30-Oct-24 03:37 PM] akyantor#0000
Agreed. Not in favour of throwing mud just because that's what has been done before by others... üôÇ


[01-Nov-24 03:09 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I got my first parliament position!


[01-Nov-24 03:12 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Should I do anything specifically?


[01-Nov-24 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nah. Basically on Phobos our role is to act as a backup for the governor. Rise has a bunch of people that make him governor items very cheaply, and he reimburses himself at his own pretty low rate for it. But he is extremely picky an opinionated about what gets donated, and won't reimburse anything other than what he wants to submit


[01-Nov-24 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
So mostly I keep some extra mats around for the COGC in case he forgets.

And I sometimes audit the contributions and compare it to the withdrawls


[01-Nov-24 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
They had all checked out for the first couple months, so I haven't done it recently


[01-Nov-24 03:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can ask about it in the government chat. I can't recall if there's a sheet for it, or if I was just watching each contribution through the UI

@archielvahr @shinonomesciences Looks like the natives are restless in plantary chat on Phobos due to open jobs for SCI. Has Rise said anything direct to either of you, or via gov chat?

I've been running programs and answering questions on Phobos. Rise has been less active lately so we might need to think about covering the planet

[14-Apr-25 08:46 AM] akyantor#0000
@allocater I'd assume you'll need to adjust the IDC deal, as this is quite a steep reduction. I've currently two bases with you, so let me know if you want to continue, and if so what the reduced payout would be per unit of IDC.
