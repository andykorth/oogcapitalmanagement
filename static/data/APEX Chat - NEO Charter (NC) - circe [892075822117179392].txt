**Lovehungusall**:	Also just a heads up, we should have the CoGC up in soon, just waiting on a few electrionics. Did you want to help with the funding at all?


[03-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	ye, I have some l-fabs, but not delivered yet, if you like contribution now, I can in NCC


[03-Oct-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lekvarky**:	what would you consider adequate? :)


[03-Oct-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	likely just money, we got the L-fabs made, I'll ping Realbandit, he is the one currently managing the stuff/money


[03-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Hey Lekvarky, yep we have all the L-Fabs finished now, they're just making their way over - few days from now the last few BWS will be done too :D


[03-Oct-21 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Estimated price is just over 500k for the entire CoGC, would you be willing to donate 50k?


[03-Oct-21 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Efan**:	I have SAR for sale if someone want


[22-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	I'd be interested in some SAR. How many you've got and what's the price range?


[22-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	nvm, seeing the ad on LM now. That's way too expensive for SAR

[28-Nov-21 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Anyone want something shipped to Moria station leaving now about 12-15h travel time?


[28-Nov-21 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The colony ship is about to go home empty since not much has been produced a couple minutes into the base's existence


[28-Nov-21 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	I've got a ton of useless NA that I'd like to get rid of. Let me know the price and I'll post


[28-Nov-21 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I can do 5 ncc/t?


[28-Nov-21 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean the ship's flying anyway though


[28-Nov-21 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but seems like an OK price for 4 jumps


[28-Nov-21 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess if you have a whole shipfull I could do less than that total


[28-Nov-21 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or if you prefer I could also buy NA for 20/ncc per t up front and sell it to the MM


[28-Nov-21 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	that works as well


[28-Nov-21 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	pop a buy on LM for 500 NA @20/u


[28-Nov-21 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	or I can ship it, it goes to MM anyway :D


[28-Nov-21 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Buy posted


[28-Nov-21 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	It changes from time to time, but I would say 105/u good right now, I would keep an eye on our ads tho if you can

[19-Jan-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Solstone**:	Just want to say "Thanks Asshole" you know who this is directed too.


[19-Jan-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	That's fucked up. Showing up and stealing months of work building to SCI?


[19-Jan-22 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Real dick move.


[19-Jan-22 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I've built a glass ship out here to service my QQ-001a <---> Circe needs, but I'll certainly be able to accommodate more shipping than just my own.


[11-Mar-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I'll be making the trip daily so it'll be reliable.


[11-Mar-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	5ncc/max unless you wanna pay more.


[16-Mar-22 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	There's a lot of micrometeoroids out here. I'm sorry to have to raise shipping prices to 7.5ncc/max to cover cost of ship repairs. The damage is 14x as much as in the Moria system, if damage scales linearly with density.


[16-Mar-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I'd never paid attention to that on the system screen before. Interesting.


[16-Mar-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Mar-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I don't produce or consume HAL directly so not much knowledge of the market. But NCC might be more successful than ICA in tempting a producer.


[28-Mar-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Mar-22 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Mar-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I generally don't produce more HAL than I need


[28-Mar-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	feels like a waste of precious base space


[28-Mar-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bant**:	Sure, but I assume you operate at a slight surplus and accumulate a bit of excess over time.


[28-Mar-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I might operate at a slight deficit though


[28-Mar-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Mar-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jun-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	@Koibu, adding more people won't help too much - we're maintaining POPI at 100% from now on, so PIOs should grow the full +30%/wk starting in the next few weeks. Adding more people will only give that +200 initial boost, but will not improve the growth rate per-person. If you really need a boost, I could consider running a PIO immigration for you, which would bring in 500 PIOs?


[05-Jun-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	But unless you're in immediate need of PIOs, the natural growth should be plenty. A rough estimate puts QQ-001c at 1k PIOs in ~7 weeks.

[09-Aug-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	the game needs an 21 century accounting systems. and I am not making the time to write it.


[09-Aug-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	@stilrz Can you explain more? I have no idea what you mean but am really interested


[09-Aug-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I would assume he's referencing the fact that the accounting systems at their core all work on the price at which a good was bought or sold and only for a single currency which A. Doesn't work well if you use multiple currencies and B.oftentimes goods are not actually bought and sold for their true cost.


[09-Aug-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarthAraknus**:	And how would 21 century accounting system fix the goods not being bought at true cost?


[09-Aug-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	first this system uses a cash acounting system. and not a good one. In Scrooges day you would have specialty printed ledgers that could summarize expenses by types and by period( month)


[09-Aug-22 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	So a 20th century accounting system would use an Accrual system. Profit and loss could be computed even if no sale were made. Costs could be allocated to "In process" inventory and accrue "profit" from the same


[09-Aug-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	and there is whole lot more. But basically the time, effort and materials spend on producing Bfabs/1Lfabs/Rfabs would be refected in the cost when a building is consturcted. Also that building cost we be allocated to the goods produced. Right now I produce all my own Rfabs and the EDC I produce from my SE comes from a building with ZERO cost.


[09-Aug-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	a 21 st century acconting system would present the potential profit/loss on every decision. It could further present the economic loss of doing one items production  vs another item. -- Which is more valuable DRF-->SRD or GC-->HMS from your welding plantfor instance?


[09-Aug-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that would certainly make the game easier if you had all the answers in live time


[09-Aug-22 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Bugs I see in present cash accounting: 1) shipping charges are not allocated to goods transported 2) fabs are not allocated a cost if made internally from internal goods3) cash accounting sucks at profit


[09-Aug-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	my goal would be to get the corporate accountants with the 20th century spreadsheets to drool for this tool /game -- make making a profit a game!


[09-Aug-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Also add Ferengi accounting: Profit by  production run, by machine, by planet\, by barstool, by day, week, month, century, by project , by product line, by customer, by time

**Blackend**:	anyone have O for sale? i can buy some


[02-Feb-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Buying 20 units of HAL for 1000 each


[02-Feb-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I am about to come up on a small shortage and really hate it when things get out of sync


[02-Feb-23 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blackend**:	filled it, i can give you another 100 or so if you want at lower rates to tide you over


[04-Feb-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Got ~2500 tons / 500 m3 departing MOR->Circe in a couple hours if anyone needs anything delivered from the CX


[04-Feb-23 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vashulda**:	Is it still available?


[04-Feb-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Still available:)


[04-Feb-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vashulda**:	Ok how much for it? 1125t/500m3


[04-Feb-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Maybe 6k? Standard going rate for a 500/500 I feel like from MOR->Circe is like 8-10k so that feels like a fair discount off market rate :)


[04-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vashulda**:	Contract sent


[04-Feb-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vashulda**:	Thx


[04-Feb-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Np, thank you, should be delivered around this time tomorrow :)

[23-Feb-23 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Wyper7**:	sorry, cant use LM and my ship just left


[23-Feb-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i'd make a direct contract anyway. there's not so many people on this planet to make be believe to get an immediate reaction on the LM :D


[23-Feb-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I always double check to avoid that kind of situations since my only solution would be to ship fuel myself with other ship


[23-Feb-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's the problem. my other ship is occupied with another trade route 24-7


[23-Feb-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	send me a contract for that FF if you want


[23-Feb-23 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	i should really deposit an emergency stock of fuel on all my bases >_<


[10-Mar-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I just keep fuel on CX, its hub that each of my ships visits


[10-Mar-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	same, but i don't keep stuff on stock :D i just plan a week ahead for base inputs.


[10-Mar-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you should fill your stock whenever price is low so you are not forced to buy when its high


[10-Mar-23 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that would be a smart decision. however, i'm not always smart :D

**bazdakka**:	hello everyone, finally got my base here after a minor stuff up on set up (had the wrong prefabs on the way to my HQ for an upgrade, not enough ADE, too many ASE...)


[08-Aug-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	on the plus side, the large warehouse available let me store all the materials on site until I could fix the problem


[08-Aug-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	for the governor, I plan on 3 LAB and a bunch of POL and CHP if it has any effect on pop infrastructure (though I don't think that will be a problem given the nice high tier pop support this planet has)

[16-Sep-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	Good


[17-Sep-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	once you've figured out the basics, a loan is massively worth it, as the first months seem like such a massive grind, as you have basically zero liquidity


[17-Sep-23 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	now I have... slightly more liquidity, but it'll be better once it's paid off xD


[17-Sep-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah, i was in the mindset of "achieving things for myself" back then so it took 3 months to set up a 2nd base

**TCW**:	xD


[17-Sep-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I figure it's all part of the game


[17-Sep-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	It's not cheating getting a mortgage to buy a house IRL, it's practically mandatory, same for doing big business these days


[17-Sep-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	only makes sense that borrowing money to get going is the best way to take advantage of a glut in the market you see.

**BlackAnthrax**:	you dont need a corp for that xD


[17-Sep-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's probably just better to join a corp that already got a corp hq on a planet you want to settle on


[17-Sep-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	because the corp hq is kinda expensive

[17-Sep-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Sep-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	I produce more HAL than I can use, but it's not a ton extra. Apparently I need to be a little more careful when I ship off the excess.


[24-Sep-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It can occasionally happen where my Chem Plants produce two loads in the time my Extractors do one load, and if I don't have a reserve it will stop the production lines.


[24-Sep-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Despite me technically producing more HAL than I can use in any 24 hour period.

[07-Oct-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Got a tiny contract listed on Moria... btw, is there anyone who does thie MOR - Circe route frequently that I could ping for contracts?  This is a further edge of my shipping, and if I know people regurally do MOR - Circe (and I could list 'em in one of the markets), I'll bring more shipments there rather than hauling 'em.


[07-Oct-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	As an aside, I also have a good bit of H2O, C, and RAT/DW production that I could ship to Circe and sell on the LM (if people are interested)

[16-Oct-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I wish you could build bases past 1000 area


[16-Oct-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It'd definitely be interesting. For planets like Promitor it would be overpowered, but for outer worlds it could be more incentive


[16-Oct-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	One of the ideas I saw and liked was someone suggesting as you get further from the core, the more area extra permits add to your bases, from 250 extra all the way up to 500 or something


[16-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	doom and gloom, EPO strong


[25-Oct-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	it's just dipping a bit like it does every few days


[25-Oct-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	volumes seem solid, actually probably due for another big buy off soon I think


[26-Oct-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	epo never really crashed. long term it's more like small waves :D


[26-Oct-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	My unused permit count boosted my EPO production from 57.3/day to 60.2/day.  Whoo woo!


[26-Oct-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shagie**:	Just the chem / fuel / resource.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	HQ efficiency bonus is: Multiplier = -2 * (UsedPermits / TotalPermits) + 3


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But not that the used / total part of that.  If that is 6/6 - then the mutliplier is -2 * 1 + 3 == 1


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	But if you've got 6 used out of 8 permits, that's -2 * 0.75 + 3 == -1.5 + 3 == 1.5


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	And so my company HQ bonus is slightly more.


[26-Oct-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	we don't deliver these days unfortunately ... all contracts are for MOR. It did used to be an option but we had to simplify things to catch up the queue last summer. Delivery times had grown to 2 months or more back then when a couple key builders quit the game.


[16-Dec-23 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The good news is the average ship build is down about 7 days, give or take.


[16-Dec-23 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	7d is crazy :o


[16-Dec-23 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	While I am happy for you guys that you got your ship build time down to 7 days, it also nukes my advertising campaign I had planned "why wait 2 months when you can buy one of mine next week" (I am targetting a ship a week capacity)


[17-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Dec-23 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Dec-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	This is also a debate on YI-705c.  One of the issues is that one permit for just mining HAL overwhelms one permit for just CHP on another planet.


[24-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Yeah personally I only do my CL bases with extractors on site. It would suck to ship it all over the place.


[24-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If you balance them right the imports/exports get really manageable


[24-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	Basically a once a month visit base, where you pick up about a million of product or more.


[24-Dec-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	(I usually just grab my NA with my CL so not running perfect WCB's of CL, those are over 3 mil in product for one ship load)

**Zaggurant**:	That's just DarkFuel trading ship parts to stay on top of the ship leadership board


[10-Jan-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Don't think manufacturing is actually happening here in large quantities


[10-Jan-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	All my ship stuff is in the OT-889 system


[11-Jan-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HuntianaJones**:	does that mean you make RCT @craftsmanThirteen?


[11-Jan-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yes, well I make whole ships - if you are interested in parts or a whole ship shoot me a DM.  Ship delivery would be out to Late February probably

[16-Feb-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	you should have around 1500 tons and precisely 142 m^3 left and around


[16-Feb-24 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	I'll leave it empty of my own stuff, so the full 142m2 is open for you - as much as you can fit into there should be good to go

[29-Mar-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	I normally put things up for between 10-15 per m³/t and generally people accept it


[29-Mar-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	but I'd split it up so that they can use it to fill their excess space rather than dedicate a trip just for it


[29-Mar-24 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xooch**:	I just posted a sell LM ad ... we'll see lol, idk. 220 each


[29-Mar-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	That's a good price and I'd be tempted (if I didn't already have 3 weeks worth in base)


[30-Mar-24 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	Inbound to Circe in 16 hours, headed to MOR. With 300m^3 open


[30-Mar-24 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, the IS-QQ is a 500/500 that I've got for chartering Circa - Circe travel.


[30-Mar-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Good to know.  I've been thinking about a system vessel, but maybe you can stave that off for a while.


[30-Mar-24 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	What're your rates?


[30-Mar-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm thinking flat rates, though it depends on which side of the map the ship is on.  1000 credits if I'm there, 2000 if I'm not (and need to fly there though this means if you've got something going the other way, 1000 and 1000.).  Any amount up to 500/500.


[30-Mar-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Okay, gotcha.  Good to know, thanks.


[30-Mar-24 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'll be charting ~50 fuel routes.  That may be 1h, it may be 8h.


[30-Mar-24 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Right now the planets are in oposition - and so 50 fuel is 6h 24m from Circe to Circa.


[30-Mar-24 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Understood.


[30-Mar-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I'm shipping a base in to Circa in 13h.  BMPs at this time.  Might spin up a WPL (I've got RCO growing on Harmonia in spare capacity there)


[30-Mar-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I have plenty of extra cotton (raw and processed) sitting on Circa if you need any extra while you stand up your base.


[30-Mar-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	I may take you up on that.  I don't have the WPL parts on this shipment (just PIO stuff)


[30-Mar-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@Enemycube how many tons available?


[30-Mar-24 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Btw, Apex trick - FLT, INV, and BS all accept a system as a paramter.


[30-Mar-24 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	So INV QQ-001 shows all the inventories in this system.  Bases, warehouses, ship cargos.


[30-Mar-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	@--SCHAITR-- 1950 tons. I figured it wasn't worth mentioning since I'd likely be volume restricted


[30-Mar-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	actually that raises a good question, is there anything dense enough to go over that given the volume? I don't know enough of the resources


[30-Mar-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	AU is way up there.


[30-Mar-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(and that's the correct density of gold)


[30-Mar-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Sending you a contract @Enemycube


[30-Mar-24 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	For Circe-Mor leg


[30-Mar-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EnemyCube**:	well I suppose that I will always include both numbers, incase someone is stockpiling AU on Circe and wants to accept it! that'd definitely go over what I had


[30-Mar-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-25 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-25 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-25 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-25 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yeah, you usually don't see this pop up until you start hiring technicians or above unless you're building on a really sparsely populated planet.


[28-Jan-25 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rinoic**:	I didn't realize there was a limit that you can get from unemployed forces


[28-Jan-25 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rinoic**:	Oh it's only for techs and above? Or just because Pios and Settlers are easier to get?


[28-Jan-25 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-25 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Circe actually has a narrower population pyramid than some other planets, but you may notice that a lot of places have way more pioneers and settlers than anything else.


[28-Jan-25 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rinoic**:	It's definitely a non issue with my FRMs on prom, plopped down 6 additional farms and it all got filled


[28-Jan-25 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Yep, Promitor has zillions of pioneers.


[28-Jan-25 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	It gets worse with engineers and scientists because they don't grow through immigration the way pioneers through technicians do.  They have to be educated, which can take a very long time.


[28-Jan-25 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rinoic**:	Yeah, I've always been curious about IDC farms, it takes at least 60 days to break even according to PRUNplanner, but I can imagine having to wait for the scientists

**Stonk**:	Seems like I forgot 2 MCG for my last repair. Can anyone fill me on LM?


[09-Feb-25 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you didn't forget it, the number of MCG needed increases over time. In BRA you should set a "Time offset" to account for that before getting the amount of MCG you need


[09-Feb-25 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	I calculated up front with prunplanner.


[09-Feb-25 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But seems like I made a mistake somehow


[09-Feb-25 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you probably also need to tell prunplanner to apply a time offset


[09-Feb-25 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	because it can't know how much time will pass between the moment you buy and the moment you repair


[09-Feb-25 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	being able to see the chart of repair costs vs days since last repair is a really useful feature though.


[09-Feb-25 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I always use the BRA time offset and then bring some extra MCG anyway.  I hate coming up short on repair shipments.

**Retread**:	Kallista c is like that for me, -1.9 HAL production.  Every few weeks I switch my experts from mostly chem to mostly resource extraction.  It only takes a few days to replenish the stockpiles and I'm good to go again.

**stosXri**:	not a bad trick! once i have experts to spare :p
